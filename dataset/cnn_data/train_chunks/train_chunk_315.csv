"Manchester, New Hampshire (CNN) -- Earlier this year, as Frank Guinta was driving his children to school, he turned on a local radio station and heard Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul talking about Guinta's failed attempt to win re-election to Congress just a few months earlier. Paul was discussing the future of the Republican Party and the need for the GOP to maintain its traditional political base while also welcoming more libertarian-minded conservatives. The Kentucky senator then started citing specific data from the 2012 general election, including Guinta's race. ""Your two Republicans up there lost recently for Congress,"" Paul said to New Hampshire political reporter James Pindell in the telephone interview on WGIR. ""They lost by four percentage points, and the libertarian in each race got 4½ percent, so really we do have to figure out a way to attract some of those voters who are voting libertarian if we want to have enough of a majority to win."" Guinta, who served just one term in the House, said he was intrigued to hear Paul talk about his race, let alone in so much detail. ""This was not his political adviser,"" the New Hampshire Republican said during a recent interview over breakfast. ""It was him."" But Guinta, who is considering running for office in 2014, said he was not shocked by the moment. After all, this is New Hampshire, which holds the first-in-the-nation primary. And Republicans with designs on the White House are always keeping close tabs on what happens in the Granite State. It would just be a few months later, in May, when Paul would actually visit the state to headline a New Hampshire GOP fundraiser and convene a listening session with local activists. It was not lost on anyone that Paul dug into his own political pocket and donated $10,000 to the state GOP. Despite smug dismissals of early campaign coverage by press critics, media elites and some of the potential candidates themselves, there are signs everywhere -- including Paul's intricate recitation of New Hampshire congressional contests -- that the 2016 race for president is starting to take shape, at least among Republicans. Take, for instance: . • This week's Faith and Freedom Coalition conference, which has been widely described as the first 2016 GOP presidential cattle call. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum and Paul are all participating. Cruz invited to key early presidential state . • New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's willingness to play along with a 2016 joke on Wednesday's ""Late Night with Jimmy Fallon."" • Paul's visits already to Iowa and New Hampshire, and upcoming trips to South Carolina and Iowa (again). • Cruz's appearance last month at a South Carolina GOP fundraiser and an upcoming visit to Iowa. • Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal headlining a New Hampshire Republican fundraiser last month. • Ohio Sen. Rob Portman headlining a fundraiser this week for the New Hampshire Republican Party. • Rubio's use of his political action committee to finance a television commercial that defended New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte against critics of her position on gun rights. • Santorum's visit to South Carolina in March to campaign for a Republican candidate in a special congressional election, and his planned visit to Iowa this summer. • Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker's appearance at a county Republican fundraiser in Iowa last month. Walker trip fuels 2016 speculation . To dismiss all this political activity would be naïve. Beyond the obvious -- control of the White House and the direction of the country for four or eight years -- these potential candidates are already exerting influence over the national dialogue and the direction of their political party. • On immigration: Rubio is the key player at the moment, while Cruz may have an influential role as the legislation is being debated. • On the surveillance controversy: Paul has become a chief spokesman opposing this collection of information. • On the state of the GOP: Jindal has admonished fellow Republicans to ""stop being the stupid party."" • On where to find solutions: Perry and Walker emphasizing the need for national Republicans to look to the states for answers. While New Hampshire Republicans acknowledge that it's too early for candidates to engage in a full-blown campaign, there are steps potential presidential candidates can take now that are being welcomed, if not embraced. ""What Paul and Jindal are doing is very smart,"" Rich Killion, a GOP strategist based in Concord, said of the fundraising for the state party and air cover provided to Ayotte. ""They are trying to do well for others and by doing so are helping themselves. It's never too early when you come on behalf of others."" But when is too early? It's fair to say that Mitt Romney never stopped running for president after he lost the GOP nomination in 2008, and Tim Pawlenty was very active early on in building a campaign structure for the 2012 election, only to become the first candidate to drop out of the race in August 2011. What a candidate can't do is suddenly decide to run for president a year before the primary without having done any spade work and expect strong results. ""You can't do it in 12 months,"" said New Hampshire Republican Party Chair Jennifer Horn, who noted that a campaign needs to begin sooner rather than later. And when the candidates arrive, Horn said, ""The issues that push New Hampshire voters are jobs, the economy, and individual freedoms."" While social conservatives play an influential role in the Iowa and South Carolina primaries, New Hampshire Republicans tend to be more focused on economic issues, which could provide a springboard for more a centrist Republican eyeing the White House -- someone like Christie. ""New Hampshire voters focus on the issues that directly affect them, primarily the economy,"" said Alicia Preston, a Republican consultant based in Hampton Beach. ""Social issues tend to be second-tier for most New Hampshire voters and they are willing to accept a social moderate as long as they have a fiscal conservative badge."" Christie passes on conservative gathering for Clinton conference . If there is a contested primary-within-a-primary among social conservative candidates who spend their time, money and effort attacking one another in Iowa and South Carolina, that could further add to the already outsized influence New Hampshire has on the process of choosing the GOP nominee. The winner of the New Hampshire primary might not suffer the same political wounds as the candidates who battled for support in the Iowa caucuses and prepared for, perhaps, a last stand in South Carolina. Still, as early GOP maneuvering is on full public display, Democrats are largely in a holding pattern waiting to see if the 800-pound donkey in the room makes a move: former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. It's Clinton's for the having -- at least that's the conventional wisdom at this point -- if she wants the Democratic presidential nomination. Should Clinton decide not to run, then Vice President Joe Biden rolling out the red carpet for Iowa and New Hampshire Democrats during the inauguration and Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley inviting New Hampshire Democrats down for a St. Patrick's Day party at the governor's residence will surely be remembered by those who hold an incredible amount of influence in choosing presidents.","Potential 2016 presidential candidates already influencing national dialogue .

"(CNN) -- Tens of millions of online note-takers found themselves worrying about their security Monday, as questions remained about a weekend hack of Evernote. The online note-taking and archiving service began requiring its 50 million users to reset their passwords Saturday after announcing it was the victim of a security breach, making it the latest tech company in recent weeks to fall victim to hackers. In a blog post, the California-based company said its security team ""has discovered and blocked suspicious activity on the Evernote network that appears to have been a coordinated attempt to access secure areas of the Evernote Service."" The company said no user content or financial information was accessed. But the hackers were able to access user information, including user names, e-mail addresses and encrypted passwords. Evernote said the encryption coding they use to protect passwords is ""robust,"" but still sent the password warning to users of the service, which is popular among college students and others who rely on taking notes for later use. Sophos Security analyst Graham Cluley said in a blog post that it remains unclear how long the hackers had access to Evernote and how they managed to get in. ""What's not good news,"" he wrote, ""is that the hackers now have access to the usernames and email addresses of Evernote customers. It is easy to imagine how this information could be abused -- for instance, the hackers could send out spam emails to those users claiming to come from Evernote, and trick them into visiting a malicious website. ""And, of course, it's another cautionary tale about the risks which can exist with trusting the cloud to look after your personal information."" Like many services, Evernote stores data on remote servers instead of the user's computer. This allows them to be accessed from multiple computers and other devices. Evernote warned users of the possibilities Cluley noted. He argued that their message -- warning users not to click phony security e-mails while sending out a security e-mail of their own -- could confuse users. Complicating matters is that the legitimate Evernote e-mail pushes users first to a website with the domain name ""mkt5371"" before taking them to Evernote itself. Cluley wrote that this is a service Evernote is likely using to track how many of its users changed their passwords and says not to worry. ""That's a technique commonly used in a normal marketing email communications, but looks very out of place in an email about a security breach which tries to hammer home the point to 'Never click on reset-password requests in emails,"" he said. Last week, customer support tool Zendesk announced it was hacked, with the breach exposing the e-mail addresses of users of three other websites -- Tumblr, Pinterest, and Twitter, all of which use Zendesk. Microsoft, Apple, and Facebook last month said they were the victim of hackers, and Twitter said in January that it, too, was hacked. Reports that surfaced last week suggested that a gang of hackers based in Eastern Europe was behind at least some of the attacks, using a website frequented by developers who use Apple's mobile operating system to worm their way into companies where they hoped to steal valuable information. Evernote launched in 2008 as a way to archive images, documents, notes and other data online. A version for businesses is available in more than 30 countries. CNN's Melissa Gray contributed to this report.","Tens of millions changing passwords after Evernote was hacked .

"Washington (CNN) -- It's the wildest dream of tea party extremists: the ultimate political comeuppance for the liberal President they love to hate. Since the day Barack Obama got elected to the White House, they have wanted to force him out. First, it was the birth certificate. Then, it was the bailouts. A succession of other allegedly impeachable issues followed: IRS targeting, the Benghazi terrorist attack, executive branch overreach. But it's not going to happen, even if Republicans take back the Senate and retain their House majority in the November congressional elections. Here's why: . No chance: The numbers just don't add up. Under the most optimistic election result for Republicans, they would be far short of the two-thirds Senate majority needed to convict Obama if the House passed articles of impeachment. Also, a CNN/ORC International Poll last week showed nearly that two in three respondents opposed impeaching the President. GOP leaders such as House Speaker John Boehner know all that, and so they're trying to tamp down the expectations of their conservative base. ""We have no plans to impeach the President,"" Boehner said this week. ""We have no future plans."" GOP-led House authorizes lawsuit against Obama . House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, who may have presidential ambitions in 2016, also quashed the possibility, saying Wednesday that ""this does not rise to the high crimes and misdemeanors level"" of impeachment. 'Stop just hatin' all the time': Meanwhile, Obama and Democrats talk up the threat to raise money and inspire their supporters to turn out in November. ""Don't boo. Vote,"" Obama told a Kansas City, Missouri, crowd that voiced its displeasure Wednesday over GOP tactics he criticized. The President cited the vote by House Republicans authorizing Boehner to sue him over executive actions, saying Congress should instead be passing legislation. ""They're mad because I'm doing my job,"" Obama said of his Republican foes, urging them to ""stop just hatin' all the time."" Top House Democrat: 'You bet we're going to run' on impeachment . In debate before Wednesday night's vote, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi made sure to link the lawsuit proposal to possible impeachment down the road, calling it a first step to trying to oust the President next year. The issue resonates with Democratic supporters, according to Rep. Steve Israel of New York, who chairs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. The group has raised $7.6 million online since Boehner announced the lawsuit plan just over five weeks ago, he said. ""You bet we're going to run on a Congress that is just obsessed with lawsuits, suing the President, talking about impeaching him instead of solutions for the middle class, talking about jobs and infrastructure,"" he said. 'Not how America works': It all makes for grand Washington theater in an election year but reflects deeper political undercurrents, particularly for a right wing already divided between diehard conservatives and more moderate Republicans. Brown University political scientist Wendy Schiller called impeachment a ""farfetched"" maneuver that could cause independent voters leaning Republican now to instead vote Democratic in November. ""It reflects in the Republican Party the idea that if you lose an election, you can use every means possible to nullify the result,"" she said. ""That's just not how America works."" Jonathan Chait, a writer who predicted four years ago in a New Republic article that House Republicans would vote to impeach Obama before his presidency ended, said Wednesday that he now doubts that will happen. Missteps by Republicans, including primary defeats of viable candidates by conservative extremists and the government shutdown they forced last year, ""really convinced the establishment that they couldn't indulge the base on all its flights of fancy,"" Chait said. GOP pivot: Now Boehner and others want to steer their base away from impeachment, he said, noting that they fear getting pushed into holding a vote that would be politically damaging. In dismissing an impeachment move, Boehner and Ryan sought to shift the blame for any discussion about it onto Democrats and the White House. Boehner called it a Democratic fundraising ""scam,"" adding, ""They're trying to rally their people to give money and to show up in this year's elections."" Obama lambastes Republicans for 'hatin' all the time' Asked about the accusation, White House spokesman Josh Earnest offered a list of Republican legislators who have discussed impeaching Obama in recent months, including Reps. Steve King of Iowa, Ted Yoho of Florida and Steve Stockman and Blake Farenthold of Texas. The challenge to Boehner and other GOP leaders is to find a middle path between tea party demands to impeach Obama and less extreme options for action, such as the lawsuit. An impeachment effort after the November election would dominate Washington in the final two years of Obama's presidency, posing possible benefits and risks. It would divert attention from congressional dysfunction contributing to dismal approval ratings but also could cause the public to blame Republicans for exacerbating that dysfunction. ""We've got a lot of tools at our disposal,"" Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma said, citing such steps as cutting funding for some parts of government disproportionate to the problems. ""Nor do I think you ought to do things in a legislative sense to harass the President,"" said Cole, who is a Boehner ally. ""We've got a disagreement between the two branches, and this is not uncommon. You go to court, and that's what we're seeking to do."" Nixon: The impeachment proceedings against President Richard Nixon and his subsequent resignation still rankle many Republicans today, 40 years later. It was an event that made efforts to remove a sitting president part of routine political discussion in America. A GOP-led House voted to impeach President Bill Clinton on charges of perjury and obstruction in 1998. The Senate acquitted him on both charges, with none of the minority Democrats voting to convict, and he stayed in office. Today, any Republican with presidential ambitions -- such as Ryan, perhaps -- wants to avoid making impeachment a reflex response to dissatisfaction with the White House, Schiller noted. ""If you want to be president some day,"" she said, ""the last thing you want is for Congress to be able willy-nilly to impeach you."" CNN's Deirdre Walsh, Kevin Liptak and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.","Tea party dream of ousting the President not realistic .

"Dearborn, Michigan (Kaiser Health News) -- Signing people up for health insurance is the easy part of Rawha Abouarabi's job ministering to immigrants and Arab Americans in this manufacturing hub along the Rouge River. But many of those she's enrolled are surprised and indignant when they go to the doctor and are asked to a pay a bill -- perhaps a copayment. They insist they've already paid their monthly insurance premium. ""They call us and say, 'It's a scam',"" says Abouarabi, an insurance navigator for the Arab Community Center for Economic & Social Services (ACCESS), a nonprofit agency that specializes in helping the largest Arab-American population in any U.S. city. That's just one example of the confusion immigrants face as they try to navigate the U.S. health care system. Even after signing up for insurance through the Affordable Care Act, advocates find that explaining to clients that they will still have to pay out of their own pockets each time they go to the doctor or get lab tests requires more than translating words like ""premium"" and ""deductible"" for non-English speakers. ""This whole concept of insurance doesn't exist in the Eastern world,"" said Madiha Tariq, public health manager for ACCESS. ""People are always confused about the health care system when they come to this country."" Problems like this are arising all over the country where Latino, Asian and other immigrant populations face cultural as well as language barriers. Non-citizens are three times more likely to be uninsured than U.S.-born residents, according to the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured. As many as 10 million non-citizens living legally in the United States are expected to gain health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, although it's unclear how many have gained coverage so far. Mandate covers legal immigrants . Many of these immigrants are getting insurance because the ACA requires them to do so, just as it does for U.S. citizens, and because it may be affordable for the first time. Like citizens, legal immigrants can use the law's online exchanges to sign up for coverage and find out if they are eligible for government subsidies. They also face a tax penalty if they don't sign up. Immigrants who are not in the country legally, however, are barred from using the exchanges and aren't required to have coverage. ACCESS clients typically hail from places such as Yemen, Lebanon, Iraq, Bangladesh and Syria. Besides training navigators and helping clients enroll, the center offers primary care services, cancer screenings and various public health awareness workshops in the community. Some of them are not easy to convince that they should enroll in health coverage. ""Iraqis don't believe in insurance,"" said Hasanain Al Ani, a case manager at ACCESS and a refugee from Iraq, who says people from his country are accustomed to government-sponsored health care. ""They don't know about it [health insurance] and they don't want to know about it."" Tariq said another challenge has been helping clients understand how access to doctors works in the United States. ""In their country, the wait time depends on socioeconomic status ... the lower the status, the longer the wait time,"" she said. Barra K., 27, who didn't wish to be identified by her full name, came to Dearborn as a refugee from Baghdad in February and developed a severe sore throat. She was shocked at the prices for the medication, let alone what it costs to see the doctor as someone without health insurance. ""Here I have to pay $70 to see a doctor, but in Iraq I only have to pay $15 and do not have to wait as long,"" she said. She couldn't afford the doctor or the medication so she had to wait the illness out. She does not qualify for full Medicaid services because she hasn't been in the country for five years, but Michigan's Medicaid program does give her access to some limited emergency services. Cultural issues can be barrier to care . But toughing it out is harder for people with chronic diseases, which are a big problem among ACCESS clients who suffer from diabetes, breast cancer, cardiovascular disease and, oftentimes among refugees, depression. Cultural barriers also make it difficult to get some clients to come in for care. ""We have ladies who have never had a mammogram,"" Tariq said. ""Cancer is stigmatized in the Arab culture. [Women] were scared no one would marry their daughters if others found out they were diagnosed."" That's because people worry the cancer is hereditary and can be passed down from mother to daughter. To persuade women to come in for mammograms, Tariq said, ACCESS has an unmarked door that allows them to slip in and out of the testing area without being identified. ACCESS also distributes a special pamphlet for Arab American women, explaining the importance of mammograms and how to examine themselves. It also pairs women diagnosed with cancer with survivors who can help them navigate the system and give them support. Public health workshops have also helped get others to come in regularly for testing and physicals. ACCESS also helps people with chronic illness navigate how to pay for their care. ""As a diabetic I was walking on eggshells,"" said Najwa Dahdah, 48, as she talked about paying for the insulin she needed to manage her diabetes. She had had insurance, but after getting diagnosed with diabetes while she was pregnant with her third child in 2005, her premium skyrocketed from $400 a month to almost $900 a month. She canceled the policy and started paying for doctors' appointments out of pocket. She clipped manufacturer coupons and constantly asked her doctors for insulin samples to help her manage her ailment. But since signing up again under the health law, which prohibits charging higher premiums to those with health issues, Dadah and her husband receive $430 in subsidies toward their monthly insurance premium, while her children qualify for Medicaid, the federal-state insurance program for the poor. The premium ""is now $133 for both my husband and I through Blue Care Network,"" Dahdah said. ""It's a blessing."" States work around Obamacare to help undocumented immigrants . Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.","Immigrants often face confusion as they try to navigate U.S. health care system .

"(CNN) -- Waking to another cloudless morning, you dive off your houseboat into the wild blue of Lake Powell in southern Utah. The water takes the edge off the heat, and you float along, contemplating a lazy day of navigating spectacular red-rock gorges and flooded canyons. Brian Raub, founder of Lakelubbers.com, says lakes have an inherent advantage over the ocean when it comes to vacations. ""You'll probably prefer the feel of freshwater over salt, and you probably won't miss seasickness, seaweed or sharks. You can choose your outdoor temperatures; lakes exist at elevations from below sea level to 13,000 feet above."" See more of America's best lakes . And temperature isn't your only choice: America offers a lake vacation for every season and activity, and no matter where you live, even in the Southwest desert, chances are there's one near you. Satellite mapping has yet to yield a precise answer, but the best guess is that there are between 3 and 4 million lakes across the U.S., ranging from duck ponds to wonders like Oregon's Crater Lake. While Lake Tahoe is most popular for winter sports and Wisconsin's Lake Winnebago reaches its windsurfing peak in fall, we associate most lakes with summer, as places to cool off and chill out. A recent study by ResortsandLodges.com named lake vacations the most popular summer travel trend of 2012, ahead of beach vacations, romantic getaways, and family trips. So spend your Labor Day weekend, or one of the few remaining warm weekends of the season, on the lake. Travel + Leisure: Weigh in on the America's Favorite Cities survey . Lake Superior: Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin . Best for fishing: Lake Superior is so vast it could easily hold all of the water from all of the other Great Lakes. That means there's plenty of room for fish to thrive: salmon, trout, walleye, smelt, whitefish, herring, northern pike, smallmouth bass and many other game species can be caught in abundance along the lake's tristate shores. No matter what time of year, some sort of fishing is in season; Duluth (MN) and Bayfield (WI) are among the charter hubs. Stay: Lutsen Resort, MN; lutsenresort.com.

Best for scuba diving: Other lakes have shipwrecks or sunken towns, but only Crater Lake offers the bragging rights of diving in a flooded volcano that also happens to be the deepest lake in the U.S. (and ninth deepest in the world). Without a deep-sea submersible you won't be able to reach the absolute bottom (1,943 feet). But there's plenty to explore in the crystal-clear shallows: lava formations, wildlife (trout and salmon), and underwater moss meadows. The catch is that you have to schlep your own scuba equipment up and down the Cleetwood Cove Trail -- 700 vertical feet. If that's not your idea of vacation, try the Wizard Island boat cruises around the crater's island on that clear, calm blue water. Stay: Crater Lake Lodge; craterlakelodges.com.

"(CNN) -- After seeing Joseph Gordon-Levitt's ""Don Jon"" this weekend, it wouldn't be surprising if the already lusted-after actor won new admirers. But sorry, interested parties: It turns out the 32-year-old is taken. As Gordon-Levitt revealed to Howard Stern this week on the media personality's Sirius XM radio program, he's been quietly seeing someone who's not in the industry. ""I have a girlfriend, but I tend not to really like to talk about it in public. She is not in show business,"" he said, adding that they met through ""mutual friends."" The reason why Gordon-Levitt hasn't mentioned anything about his love life in the past is because he worries that the public's knowledge of his relationship status would get in the way of his ability to disappear into a character. ""I get up in movies and I play other people. So when the audience is watching me in movies, I don't want them thinking about me, and who I'm dating,"" Gordon-Levitt said. Plus, the woman he's currently with prefers not to be identified. Review: 'Don Jon' a dirty-minded romantic comedy . This paramour was probably pleased, then, that Gordon-Levitt stuck to his guns about keeping their relationship quiet as Stern peppered the actor with questions. But we are curious what her thoughts were about his statements on commitment. Stern was teasing Gordon-Levitt that ""Don Jon,"" a romantic comedy about a guy whose addiction to online porn becomes an issue when he finds the woman of his dreams, was somewhat autobiographical. After all, ""Don Jon"" is the first feature-length film Gordon-Levitt has both written and directed. But, the star said, that doesn't mean he drew from his own life to tell the story. ""I wouldn't say (that I have an addiction to porn). I've had some sex with women that wasn't so good. I've also had lots of sex that was good,"" Gordon-Levitt said with a laugh. ""The whole story of 'Don Jon' is that he can't connect with anybody."" People can get used to ""this one-way satisfaction given by whatever media they consume, be it pornography or television."" When the conversation turned to marriage and long-term commitment, Gordon-Levitt was less definitive. ""I think that I could partner up with somebody -- I don't know who that somebody is -- I could partner up with a woman and commit to, like, 'OK, we're going to raise a family, and that's this project that we're going to stick to for 20-something years.' During that time, if (monogamy) was part of it, and it made sense, I could be sexually monogamous,"" the actor said. ""After that, once the kids are out of the house, I ... things go so fast, my life changes so much ... who knows if it's the better thing for me or the better thing for her,"" he continued. ""I like to not be too committed to any one future that's really far away, unless there's a reason."" For now, the one commitment he appears to have in his sights is pursuing a career as a feature filmmaker, as well as a thespian. ""Don Jon"" is currently receiving positive reviews after a strong showing at Sundance earlier this year. Interestingly enough, if Gordon-Levitt were to celebrate his success with his first film, it doesn't sound like he'd reach for something in the alcohol cabinet. ""Drinking can be fun sometimes, but weed, I certainly do it more often,"" he candidly told Stern. ""I go through phases sometimes where it's every day. It's not every day these days. I pace around and have all sorts of good ideas. I was stoned when I first thought of 'Don Jon' as a comedy. I think it's different for everybody, but certainly the way that I use it, I absolutely think it has a positive effect on my creative process."" ""Don Jon,"" which also stars Scarlett Johansson, Julianne Moore and Tony Danza, is now in theaters.","Joseph Gordon-Levitt opened up to Howard Stern this week .

"(CNN) -- Who takes the cake: New York or L.A.? As part of our Destination USA project pitting rival cities against each other, New York beat Los Angeles in our completely unscientific poll, gaining 52% of the approximately 7,000 votes cast, compared with L.A.'s 48%. But Angelenos walloped New York in enthusiastic support for their city, sharing our Los Angeles lover's column on L.A.'s virtues more than 30,000 times on Facebook, compared with 1,400 endorsements for our transplanted New Yorker's love letter to NYC. And that robust participation from the City of Angels translated into more than 500 reader comments on the Los Angeles story, compared with 150 on the New York installment of the smackdown. We asked iReporters and commenters to share the very best things about their respective cities and why they like them better than any other. Some felt the need to add a little trash talk. You decide if they're right. Talking a little smack . New York inspires people to accomplish great things they could not imagine anywhere else, according to iReporter Mandana Armand of Gramercy Park, in Manhattan. ""That greatness is just around the corner, always in New York. You never know what kind of fortuitous kindling this city will throw at you."" New York is the center of the modern world, claims iReporter Craig Clemens, a former Los Angeles resident. ""Finance, real estate, publishing -- it's almost too much for an Angeleno to take in. I should know because I used to be one."" Not so, claims L.A. defender cornholio5. ""L.A. intimidates people because they're afraid to admit it's better than where they're from. In L.A., we order bagels from people that don't yell at us. We don't care if your pizza is better. We like ours, but we like yours, too. We legally smoke weed, we surf, we go to work in flip-flops and we drive Priuses. We work hard, we're laid back, we eat avocados and we do yoga. We respect N.Y., and don't even expect it back. That's how we roll."" Residents of Los Angeles rave about the good weather, and more. ""Los Angeles has the better weather, the better technology, the car capital of the world, better jobs, better food and better people,"" writes another commenter. ""New York City: You pay outrageous rent, and who wants to pay $1,000/month just to park your car?"" Let's go out and play in New York . We admit it, both cities have great places to play, whether you're splurging or traveling on a budget. New York offers full price theater tickets to ""The Book of Mormon"" and discount theater tickets at the TKTS booth. Make reservations to Per Se or Eleven Madison Park for fine dining or grab an affordable (and incredible) burger and cheese fries at Shake Shack in Madison Square Park or ""chicken fried chicken"" at Cowgirl in the West Village. iReporter Beth Barret, who grew up on Manhattan's Upper East Side and lives in Riverdale in the Bronx, offers you her walking tour route, free of charge. ""One of my favorite things to do with friends who visit me is to start walking from the bottom of Manhattan,"" she writes. ""We start at the Statue of Liberty, walk north through Battery Park, Wall Street, the South Street Seaport, Chinatown, Little Italy, Tribeca, Soho, Greenwich Village & Chelsea. And that is only day one!"" ""Every nook and cranny of the city exudes its own pleasures, flavors and personality,"" claims Barret. ""I honestly don't think you can ever see it all. From the Edgar Allen Poe cottage in the Bronx to the site of the ... World's Fair in Queens, there is always something to see that will wow you!"" Head to One World Trade Center, says Charlottesville, Virginia, resident and iReporter Joanne Ciccone, who visits New York regularly to see her son. ""One World Trade Center is at the heart of what this country is about. Like the Phoenix rising from its ashes, NYC is building up from the horrors of 9/11. This rebuilding of structure and attitude makes NYC the greatest city on Earth. It will not be destroyed in building or beliefs."" Let's play in L.A. Los Angeles offers everything from swimming and surfing at the beach to skiing in the mountains and camping in the desert. A short drive (traffic permitting) will get you to some of the most beautiful outdoor spots in the world. ""The feeling is laid back while you cruise down Sunset Blvd. and dig on the celebrities,"" writes iReporter Allen Mealey. ""Los Angeles is the entertainment capital of the world, from the Hollywood film industry to all of the great concerts and clubs, we beat Manhattan hands down! And those Hollywood nights, those Hollywood hills."" (With thanks to Bob Seger.) DigitalGypsy, who lives in Culver City but also loves Venice, Santa Monica, West Hollywood and Silverlake, never wears anything heavier than a hoodie because the weather is so fabulous. ""It's definitely the spot to be in for surfing, skateboarding and snowboarding. Life is a little more laid back and you get to enjoy the beauty of nature that surrounds you."" Standouts to commenter Jon: Griffith Observatory, summer movies at Hollywood Forever Cemetery, monthly downtown Art Walk, the Venice Art Walk, The Perch (or any of the downtown rooftop bars), driving around actual film studios, ChaCha Lounge (hipster bar in Silver Lake), the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, MOCA (contemporary museum), Villain's Tavern and ""hiking up to the Hollywood sign or any of the hundreds of amazing hiking trails all throughout the hills and mountains of the city."" Let's eat some good food . There's no shortage of advice online or in print on the best cuisine in Los Angeles or New York. Both towns have food critics who have their preferences for high-end, low-end and everything in between -- although only Los Angeles can claim the first winner of a Pulitzer Prize for food criticism in Jonathan Gold, now at the ""Los Angeles Times. "" If you're craving a particular cuisine or need to eat in a particular part of town, plenty of foodie websites can help you out. If you're talking to residents, make sure they really like food -- because there's plenty of bad food to be had in both cities. Manhattan resident Mandana Armand loves the 21 Club for the feel of old New York, drinks at the Gansevoort Hotel and the chocolate waterfall brunch at the Waldorf Astoria. For vegetarians and vegans, Armand recommends Pure Food and Wine restaurant. ""It's a raw food restaurant that delivers the most exquisite flavors imaginable. You will not believe it is raw food."" Former Los Angeles resident and iReporter Anne McCarney has many favorite restaurants and bars to recommend: ""Homegirl Cafe (near downtown), OB's Pub & Grill (Manhattan Beach), Mama D's Italian (Hermosa or Manhattan Beach), Cafe Boogaloo (Hermosa Beach), Shark's Cove (Manhattan Beach), Empress Pavilion (Chinatown), Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles, In-N-Out, Lotus frozen yogurt (Hermosa Beach), Sweet Lady Jane's bakery (Melrose)."" And yes, Mexican food can be found almost anywhere in Los Angeles. However, commenter VikoG suggests visitors move beyond the assumption of Mexican food as beans, rice, tacos, burritos and enchiladas. ""Angelenos know better (and) we take advantage of all the delicious non-Americanized cuisine, especially mariscos, Poblano cusine, Oaxacan cusine and so many more,"" he writes. Pitting one city against the other is pointless, say some, like comparing an SUV to a sports car. ""If you want a house with a big yard, pool and palm trees, NYC is not the place for you,"" writes commenter Chris Allen, who was raised in Los Angeles and visits New York. ""If you want to live in a high-rise building in a pedestrian-friendly neighborhood where you can take the subway to work, your lifestyle options in L.A. will be rather limited. Both are cool places."" Todra Payne is married to New York City, but it's not exclusive. ""NYC is home for me, but L.A. is my secret lover,"" she writes. ""Can't beat the way you can walk Manhattan and meet people along the way, meander in and out of shops, restaurants, etc. You just can't do that in L.A. But the sunshine, beaches and palm trees and the laid back vibe in L.A. are golden. If there was a way to combine the two, it would be paradise."" Both cities, it seems, are willing to share the people they love with the city on the opposite coast.

"(CNN) -- Mobile World Congress spans the full spectrum of untethered gadgetry, from the next generation of mobile phone networks to wireless charging technology. But it's always the consumer technology that's the star. We asked Stuff Magazine Editor-in-Chief Will Findlater to analyze the top trends from the show. Trend 1: Getting the whole world connnected . Mark Zuckerberg used his keynote address to wax lyrical about Internet.org, ""a global partnership dedicated to making internet access available to the two-thirds of the world not yet connected."" By striking deals with telecommunications companies in emerging markets, Internet.org plans to get basic web services - weather reports, Wikipedia, messaging and Facebook (naturally,) to people at no cost, in the hope that it will inspire them to explore the rest of the web and reap the benefits that it can provide. And there was plenty of hardware at MWC that should help along the way. Given the deep relationship with Microsoft, many were surprised to see Nokia's mobile division adopt Android for its new devices, but Android is a platform more suited to the emerging markets at which these three devices are aimed. The X series lacks superstar specifications but do feature dual SIM slots, expandable memory and swappable cases, all of which Nokia's Windows Phone devices lack, and all of which it says the developing world wants. Mozilla's Firefox OS might not be making huge waves in the developed world, but it could be the platform that helps spread smartphone use through emerging markets. The company showed off a prototype of a $25 smartphone running Firefox OS, with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, camera, and access to HTML5 apps, at a price similar to budget feature phones. Trend 2: Wellness and wearables . The recent trend for the use of fitness trackers looks set to go into overdrive as vendors add features that allow them to harvest even more data about how we go about our daily lives. All for our own good, of course. Samsung's flagship Galaxy S range is second only to Apple's iPhone in the popularity stakes, but it has been accused of peddling gimmicks in place of meaningful innovations. This year's device majors on robustness, and its ability to get to know you better than you know yourself. It is water resistant, and round the back is a heart rate sensor that in conjunction with the S Health app can help build a more complete picture of your fitness. Like the iPhone 5S, it'll also scan your fingertips via its home button to provide an extra layer of security, and it can be used to seamlessly authorise PayPal payments. It is also a powerhouse device with a 4K video-recording, 16 megapixel camera, super-fast quad-core processor, next-generation 802.11ac Wi-Fi and a vast 5.1-inch 1080 pixel screen. Despite that, Samsung reckons its new Ultra Power Saving mode can give 24 hours of standby from a 10% battery charge. Sony's take on the fitness band takes a few cues from smartwatches, providing notifications via haptic feedback and allowing control over the music you're playing on a connected Android device. However, it's the Lifelog companion app thats the big news - it doesn't just track your activity, but it measures how you sleep, where you've been (and how fast you went there), how much you browse, play music, watch movies and game, and even more besides. Could be a bit of a wake-up call (it'll do that too.) Samsung introduced three wearable devices, the Gear 2 and Gear 2 Neo smartwatches (the latter minus a camera,) and the Gear Fit fitness band. Like the Galaxy S5 smartphone, all three came with the new ability to constantly monitor your heart rate, making them far more useful as training aids. Trend 3: Go big or go home . Smartphone screens get bigger every year, but the new normal is now so big that the ""phablet"" category seems obsolete. From now on, if your device doesn't have a 5-inch screen (or bigger), you're out of date. And the trend will only continue as companion devices such as smartwatches give us fewer reasons to fish the whopping gadgets out of our pockets. The LG G Pro 2 has a 5.9-incn 1080-pixel screen, a 13 megapixel 4K video-recording camera and huge power, making it an intriguing (and very, very big) gadget - but its key innovation is how it reacts when you wrap your knuckles on it. A custom combination of taps to lock and unlock the device, replacing Android's standard PIN and Pattern unlock. Combinations with up to 8 taps can be created, and there are 80,000 possible combinations of knock according to LG. Crucially, it works when the screen is off - no need to seek out the power button. Trend 4: The future . Tech shows are always a good opportunity to find out what's on the horizon, and MWC 2014 didn't disappoint. The best technology demonstration at the show came courtesy of Fujitsu. The prototype Sensory tablet has ultrasonic inducers on its screen that allow it to vibrate at different frequencies, creating an almost magical level of tactile feedback - it mimics different levels of friction and even creates the illusion of raised surfaces. It works wonderfully, and it should come to market in 2015. Imagine the difference it could make to mobile gaming. Blippar is a British company that's been working on augmented reality technology in smartphones for years, but using Google's smart eyewear, it can now provide real-time recognition of objects and faces in the real world, and display relevant data to the wearer in real time. This could give rise to an ""annotated world"" - pass a landmark and immediately be furnished with its history, look at a restaurant and immediately access relevant reviews. But it could also allow rich media marketing to be pumped directly into your eye. Like the one before it, the second generation phone from Russian smartphone maker Yota has two screens. At the front is the usual color LCD touchscreen, but at the back is a secondary E-ink display (similar to that on an Amazon Kindle) that only uses power when it refreshes. Via an app, you tell the secondary display what you want it to show you -- a book, a Twitter feed, notifications -- and it sits there updating from time to time without you needing to waste time and energy switching your phone back on. It's ingenious, and this year, it's a good deal slicker than it was. Follow Will Findlater on Twitter: @willfindlater . Read more: BlackBerry going back to basics, says new CEO .

"New York (CNN) -- The 24th piece in Banksy's monthlong street art residency in New York City is in the Manhattan neighborhood of Hell's Kitchen, on the garage door of Larry Flynt's infamous strip joint: The Hustler Club. The famously anonymous British graffiti artist stenciled a man holding a bouquet of flowers. INTERACTIVE: Explore Banksy in New York . ""Waiting in vain... at the door of the club,"" reads the text accompanying photos of the stencil posted on Banksy's website. Every day this month, Banksy has been unveiling new works of art around New York. The works are then announced on his website and posted to Instagram. Many of the surprise exhibits follow his signature street-art style: stencils spray-painted on streets, walls of buildings and under bridges. Others include an animated YouTube video showing what appears to be footage of jihadist militants shooting down an animated Dumbo the Elephant and traveling installations, including a slaughterhouse delivery truck full of stuffed animals touring the city. Also produced are performance art pieces such as a dirt-smeared boy shining the shoes of a life-sized statue of Ronald McDonald. Many of Banksy's pieces in The Big Apple don't last long after they are located, either defaced by local graffiti artists who don't like an outsider on their turf, or relocated and preserved to be sold to galleries and collectors by whomever owns the property Banksy happened to choose as his canvas. Opinion: Banksy's insult shows he's clueless about New York . On Tuesday, Banksy created a 1/36 scale replica of the Great Sphinx of Giza made from smashed cinder blocks. A video posted to YouTube shows a team of men loading it into a truck, and the New York Post reported the owner of a nearby business moved the sculpture in response to a top-dollar bid to purchase the piece. Fans of the mysterious graffiti artist worried for him Wednesday, when a sign posted on his website reading only, ""Today's art has been canceled due to police activity."" Banksy didn't explain. NYPD Detective Marc Nell told CNN that police were made aware of the artist's statement when people called to ask about it, but they don't know to what he was referring. The week before, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg suggested Banksy is breaking the law with his guerrilla art exhibits. Annette Markowski, an NYPD public information officer, told CNN police have not launched an investigation of Banksy because they have not received any complaints of vandalism related to the artist. Banksy's reputation was made on the streets of London, and he seems to have made his art all over -- from New Orleans on the third anniversary of Hurricane Katrina to the West Bank. But until the end of the month, the politically charged, controversial graffiti artist is expected to remain in New York City. Could the next Banksy come from Dubai?","Two dozen Banksy originals dot New York City .

"London, England (CNN) -- A letter written by Adolf Hitler in 1931 expressing hope for a ""truly cordial relationship"" between Britain and Germany was sold Tuesday, fetching £9,600 (about $14,400) at an auction. The buyer was not identified and no details were released about the transaction, in line with policy at Bonhams' auction house in London. The one-page letter was addressed to Sefton Delmer, a British journalist, in which Hitler expressed hopes of a new friendship between the two countries to replace the ""unhappy war-psychosis"" that existed after the First World War: . Hitler wrote the letter 16 months before he became chancellor and seized power in 1933. In the letter he said: ""I hope... that out of this crisis a new readiness will grow up in Britain to submit the past twelve years to a reappraisal. I should be happy, if as a result of this the unhappy war-psychosis could be overcome on such a scale as to permit the realization of the truly cordial relationship between the British and the German peoples so eagerly desired by myself and my movement. ""For I believe that the crisis now breaking in on us can only be solved by the closest political collaboration of those nations who see in the re-establishment of a natural European balance of power the first precondition to dealing with those great world problems under which Britain too suffers today."" Andrew Roberts, the British military and political historian, said the letter was a classic example of Hitler trying to lull Western democracies into a state of appeasement. Roberts said Hitler was saying there were underlying interests between Britain and Germany and that he wrote many such letters. ""He refers to 12 years which would make it 1919, the year the Versailles Treaty was signed... appeasement was his central message until the outbreak of war. Sefton Delmer would not have been taken in by any of this,"" said Roberts. Auctioneers at Bonhams in London said the letter has remained in Delmer's family until now but they could not release the name of the person selling it. Delmer was the Berlin correspondent of the Daily Express at the time when Hitler wrote the letter. He was born in Berlin and spent the first 15 years of his life there before his family were expatriated to the U.K. He is reported to be the first British journalist to interview Hitler, who he later described as a rather ordinary-looking man with hair that had been arranged too carefully.","Hitler letter sells for almost £10,000 at an auction in London .

"(The Frisky) -- ""Toy Story 3"" has been receiving nothing but praise. It's topped the box office for two weeks in a row and has pulled in $226 million so far. Not to mention that critics are lauding it as the saving grace in a horribly blah summer movie season.  But Ms. magazine is not too happy about the movie's success. Natalie Wilson, who wrote the piece, admits that the kid's movie is ""fresh"" and ""clever,"" but she also claims that it contains a few too many misogynistic and homophobic jokes for comfort. The Frisky: Angelina Jolie says daughter Shiloh wants to be a boy . Wilson's criticism of the film starts off as a numbers game. She points out that only one of the new toys is female, leaving the film with a 3-to-1 boy-girl ratio. This math can't be denied. But as one commenter pointed out, part of this is due to the fact that the playthings in the flick belonged to a boy. And even though there is an increasing number of unisex toys in the world, it's still unusual to see a little boy playing with traditionally female toys. But Ms's main argument is much more about quality than quantity. Wilson claims that ""Toy Story 3"" is full of negative female stereotypes that can give the wrong impression about gender roles. She writes that the mother in the movie is depicted as ""nagging,"" while Barbie is shown as ""over emotional"" and ""hyper-feminine."" Her packaged partner in crime, Ken, is painted as a ""closeted gay fashionista"" who is constantly teased. Wilson worries that depictions like this will teach children, especially boys, that being female or homosexual is wrong -- or at least something to laugh at. The Frisky: What Barbie's measurements look like on a real woman . Many viewers, myself included, have trouble reading ""Toy Story 3"" this way. I think Ms. is looking too hard for something to criticize. Unfortunately, children's movies have a history of being pretty darn sexist. Just look at Disney's line-up -- one film after another is about a helpless princess needing a man to get her out of a nasty situation, ending with the two falling in love and the woman giving up whatever life she had before. Most of these movies teach boys that all girls want is a handsome man with lots of money. Not really an inspiring message. But ""Toy Story"" isn't based on archaic fairy tales -- it's an original idea. While not fully politically correct, it's a stride in the right direction. The Frisky: Disney fairy tale princes teach men how to attract women . And while Wilson paints the few female characters as negative, I see them in an opposite light. Cowgirl Jessie is tom-boyish, opinionated, and doesn't just do something because a man says it's right. While the same compliments can't be loaded onto Barbie, we have to think about the doll we're dealing with here. In the real world, Barbie is constantly being attacked for being an unrealistic influence on girls. Her is body is ridiculously out of proportion and all her material possessions encourage vanity and selfishness. So of course the film is going to portray her that way -- these are Barbie stereotypes, not female ones. If anything, ""Toy Story 3"" plays on the perception of Barbie and then gives the blond doll a positive spin by making her a girl willing to give up the dream house life with Ken to fight for what's right -- her pride and friends. The Frisky: Barbie's 16 most feminist-friendly careers . As for Ken, the jokes are pretty pointed at him being a doll that isn't quite out of the walk-in closet yet. But once again, isn't Ken already a national inside joke? He is known as Barbie's arm candy with a penchant for wild clothes and pink Corvettes. How else should he be portrayed? As the macho man savior that has already been tired out in past kiddie flicks? At least they gave the character some psychological heft. If ""Toy Story 3"" is anything, it is a movie that expands and scratches away at the old stereotypes that have been plaguing both kid's movies and toys. It certainly didn't bust open the toy box with game changing plot lines and characters, but it's an improvement when compared to past pictures such as Belle falling victim to Stockholm syndrome in ""Beauty and the Beast."" Overall, this is a great kid's movie and a big improvement on the usual summer kids' fare like ""Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakel."" I rest my case!

"(CNN) -- A man who has been fighting for permanent custody of his daughter under Native American tribal law can continue to raise her for the moment in Oklahoma, a new twist in a high-profile legal case already decided by the Supreme Court. The Oklahoma Supreme Court issued an emergency stay on Friday to temporarily delay the transfer of Dusten Brown's daughter, Veronica, 4, to her adoptive parents in South Carolina. The order was made public on Tuesday. Attorneys for Brown and the adoptive couple, Matt and Melanie Capobianco of North Charleston, planned to attend a closed-door hearing at the Oklahoma Supreme Court later on Tuesday. It is unclear when that court would issue a ruling on custody. In June, a divided U.S. Supreme Court sided with Capobiancos when Brown sought to assert his parental rights. They had legally adopted her when she was a baby. The justices said the adoption was proper and did not intrude on the federal rights of the father, a registered member of the Cherokee tribe, over where his daughter would live. The court said Brown could not rely on the Indian Child Welfare Act for relief because he never had legal or physical custody at the time of adoption proceedings, which were initiated by the birth mother without his knowledge. Birth father arrested in 'Baby Veronica' adoption fight . Broad legal implications . The case raises issues about the scope of a special federal law aimed at keeping Native American families together. It also put at odds competing orders from courts in two states. South Carolina judges in recent weeks had finalized the adoption back to the Capobiancos, who are white. Following the Supreme Court order, a family court in South Carolina developed a ""transition plan"" to ease any transfer, taking into account the girl's age, sensitivities of the parties involved, and Native American heritage dynamic underlying the larger legal dispute. Brown refused to turn the child over and was cited for contempt. A warrant was issued on August 10 for ""custodial interference."" The father then took his case to Oklahoma courts. The South Carolina Supreme Court originally ruled for Brown. The adoptive couple has said separation from Veronica has been difficult. ""We are looking forward to seeing her again soon when we have the opportunity to do so, because we miss her so very much,"" said Melanie Capobianco. Christinna Maldanado, Veronica's birth mother, also expressed satisfaction when the high court ruled in June. ""Matt and Melanie are part of my family, and they have treated me like part of theirs. I'm hopeful that we will all be reunited with Veronica very soon,"" the statement said. Groups hopeful for father . Native American groups had remained hopeful Brown would maintain custody. Several parties have a stake in the outcome. These include the biological and adoptive parents, the federal government, the Oklahoma-based tribe, and a legal guardian appointed by the state to represent the child's interests. Brown had earlier signed a legal document agreeing to put the girl up for adoption, but his attorneys said he did not understand the extent of the waiver and that the birth mother misrepresented the child's American Indian heritage to social service workers when the adoption was finalized. At issue was whether Brown, as the onetime non-custodial father, could gain parental custody, after the non-Indian mother initiated an adoption outside the tribe. A special congressional law governs such interstate adoptions, since the current 556 federally recognized-tribes all fall under Interior Department oversight, giving those tribes certain unique benefits and rights. The Capobianco's lawyers had argued federal law does not define an unwed biological father as a ""parent."" Opinion: Should race be a factor in adoption? Relinquished parental rights . The Indian Child Welfare Act was a response to decades of often abusive social service practices that resulted in the separation of large numbers of native youngsters from their families, in many cases to non-Native American homes. The legislation was designed to ""promote the stability and security of Indian tribes and Indian families by the establishment of minimum federal standards to prevent the arbitrary removal of Indian children from their families and tribes and to ensure that measures which prevent the breakup of Indian families are followed in child custody proceedings."" Brown's relationship within the ""federally recognized government"" of the Cherokee Nation means Veronica is a member of the tribe and subject to its jurisdiction. ""It's not anyone's intent ever to rip a child away from a loving home,"" said Todd Hembree, the Tahlequah, Oklahoma-based tribe's attorney general. ""But we want to make sure those loving homes have the opportunity to be Indian homes first."" But Brown argued he successfully established paternity under state law, and qualified as a ""parent"" under the tribal statute, thereby giving him proper control and custody of his daughter. He agreed to relinquish his parental rights in exchange for not paying child support, but said the mother never indicated she intended unilaterally to give the child up for adoption. And Brown claims the biological mother tried to ""conceal"" his Indian heritage during the adoption process with the Capobiancos.","Top Oklahoma court issues stay of transfer of girl from father to adoptive parents .

"(CNN) -- The killing of 298 innocent people on board Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was a crime, a consequence of the war against Ukraine that Vladimir Putin started, and which he supplies, directs and controls. The Russian President bears full responsibility for this war, including the downing of the Malaysian airliner. The main problem with our reaction to Russian aggression is not even the mildness of our sanctions, but the lack of clarity of their purpose. Our message to Putin is very confused. Do we want him completely out of Ukraine, or do we want his help in dealing with that country? They are two very different requests. Despite Putin's offenses, Western leaders apparently still want him to play an active role in securing peace and stability. According to the White House, on July 17, ""President Obama called on President Putin to take concrete steps to de-escalate the situation, including pressing separatists to agree to a cease-fire."" After the Malaysian airliner was shot down, German Chancellor Angela Merkel urged Putin to use his influence with the rebels to ensure a cease-fire. In recent appearances on several TV shows, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry asked Putin to take ""immediate and clear action to reduce tensions in Ukraine,"" ""to step up and make a difference,"" and ""to use all his influence."" Despite their harsh words for Putin, leaders of the West still want his help. British Prime Minister David Cameron summed it up best when he said: ""We sometimes behave as if we need Russia more than Russia needs us."" Putin is only too glad to put on sheep's clothing and assume the role of peacemaker that he has pretended to be throughout the war that he himself started. According to him, annexing Crimea, shooting down airplanes and supporting separatists has only one purpose: to protect the Ukrainian people from alleged right-wing extremists. If you want Putin's help, beware of what you are asking. He would be glad to broker a ""diplomatic solution"" with the separatists, thus legitimizing his terrorists and entrenching them on Ukrainian territory. If that option doesn't work, we can imagine the following completely different scenario: Russian tanks roll over Donetsk. Instead of supporting the separatists, Putin arrests leaders of the Donetsk republic and persecutes them for terrorizing the local population. Blaming the Ukrainian government for its inability to protect people from the terrorists, he establishes full control over the territory, and leaves Russian troops there to secure law, order and tranquility. How would the world react to such a ""peacekeeping mission""? Would the Ukrainian army fight Russian troops? Would Western political leaders accept this as a plausible option? I do not know. But what is more important, Putin doesn't know either. We should make very clear that we would not accept Putin as a peacekeeper and we want him out of Ukraine. Western governments should not implicitly accept the aggressive doctrine called the ""Russian World,"" which was endorsed by Putin, and which gives him the right to intervene into the affairs of virtually any sovereign nation, as he did in Ukraine, using the pretext of protecting Russian-speaking citizens. The major concern of Western leaders is that by taking a strong stand against Putin, we may lose him as a useful partner in the world arena. We shouldn't worry about that. History clearly demonstrates that in all major international trouble spots in which we accepted Putin as our partner, Russia has always taken the side of the West's enemy. Such has been the case with Iraq, North Korea, Syria and Iran. It was only natural for Putin to use any invitation on our part as an opportunity to damage us. One should not expect anything different from a person with the background of a KGB officer, for whom America always has been enemy No. 1, and for whom anti-Americanism is a pillar of his power. If America is Russia's enemy, Putin's Russia cannot be our ally. Whether we like it or not, such relations are reciprocal. And from an enemy we do not need help. We need only check its aggression. For that purpose we should take the following steps: . 1. Publicly recognize that Putin is not our ally or partner, but rather our foe, and make this position clear to him and to the rest of the world. 2. Ensure that our demands to Russia be absolutely clear. Stop supporting separatists in Ukraine. We do not need Putin as a broker or peacemaker. Putin must completely get out of Ukrainian territory and Ukrainian politics. 3. Make clear that Putin's help is not needed in any other part of the world. Exclude Russia as our partner or as a mediator from any international arrangements and negotiations. 4. Reiterate our position of not accepting the annexation of Crimea. Demand that it be returned to Ukraine. 5. Stop propagating Putin's propaganda. Instead, counter it with all the power of America's media. Expand broadcasts by Radio Liberty and other radio stations. 6. Make it clear that we consider the ""Russian World"" policy a threat to world peace and stability. Insist that Russia officially renounce that doctrine and repeal supporting legislation as necessary conditions for Russia's readmission to the community of civilized nations. 7. To stop aggression against Ukraine and to prevent aggressions against other countries, make Russia pay a high price by introducing sector and other serious economic sanctions. Be ready to accept the cost of those sanctions. 8. Take immediate steps to reduce that cost and any dependence on Russia. Develop new energy sources and transportation systems in America and Europe. 9. Provide help, including military assistance, to those who are under immediate attack or potential aggression by Russia. 10. Revisit communism, an ideology that remains important in Russia as well as other countries. Educate new generations about its atrocities and bankrupt ideology. Opponents of strong action against an aggressor wrongly equate political confrontation with war. They believe that admitting that the second largest nuclear power is our enemy would usher in another Cold War and make the situation much more dangerous. History teaches us, however, that to ignore reality and appease our enemy is a more dangerous approach than to clearly articulate our principles and disagreements. When in 1983 the Soviets shot down Korean Air Lines Flight 007, Ronald Reagan denounced them as enemies of the United States and the entire world. Reagan's strong stand against the Soviet communism that threatened us for decades with nuclear war helped stop its expansion and eventually led to its complete capitulation. If we could stand against the mighty Soviet Union, we can manage Putin's much weaker Russia. In February 2000, only two months into his presidency, Vladimir Putin presented one of his first state awards to Air Force Gen. Anatoly Kornukov. In 1983, Kornukov was commander of Sokol Airbase in Sakhalin. His order to the fighter pilot was: ""Destroy the target!"" The target was Korean Air Lines Flight 007.

"(CNN) -- A twister filled with man-eating sharks is about to hit New York City -- at least on your television screen. ""Sharknado 2: The Second One"" debuts Wednesday on the Syfy network, and many fans are anxious to see if it has teeth. It's the sequel to 2013's TV movie-turned-pop cultural phenomenon ""Sharknado,"" which set social media afire. There are high expectations for it, even if one of the stars thinks the name is less than inspired. "" 'Sharknado 2,' really guys?"" asked Mark McGrath, who joins the franchise as the best friend of protagonist Ian Ziering. ""You guys have a lunch break when you were making up the title?"" Last summer, ""Sharknado"" churned up a storm of laughs and 5.3 million viewers over the course of three airings on Syfy. Audiences got creative, with A-listers live-tweeting and shark memes circling the Web. Stars Ziering and Tara Reid return in the sequel to take on the freak weather system and save the Big Apple. Ziering entered into the halls of outrageous pop culture with a climactic scene in which his character, Fin Shepard, makes a grand escape from the inside of a shark's belly by employing a chain saw. Fans hope ""The Second One"" will be just as outlandish. ""The whole thing is over the top. We have gone bigger and better in all regards,'"" said Thunder Levin, the screenwriter for both films. ""Expect to see the shark mayhem move to New York City, and by definition anything that happens in New York tends to be bigger and better."" Facing pressure from producers to replicate that iconic, gory scene with Ziering, Levin said he believes he has devised the perfect solution. ""I was 10 pages into script before that moment came to me,"" Levin said. ""I e-mailed the director, told him that's what I wanted to do, and he loved it. And I said, 'OK, don't tell anyone.' I wanted everyone else to read it as it naturally developed in the script. So for a month or so I had producers and directors breathing down my neck wanting to know what this moment will be, but I fended them off until I sent off the script. And luckily they loved it. I think the audience will like it, too."" Of course, you will have to watch to find out about the grisly scene. Bringing such outrageous episodes to life in the heart of New York had its own challenges, including filming for hours in the cold of a bitter winter (disguised as summer for the movie), paparazzi lurking behind taxis, and, literally, rubber sharks flying through the air. While filming a busy scene, McGrath found himself standing on top of a taxicab, ready to swing himself into the shark-infested cyclone. ""They go, 'All right Mark, grab onto the rope and swing across Broadway 50 feet, and jump off on the other side,' "" McGrath said. ""I'm like 'It's a string, how is anybody going to buy that?' And so we were doing it and jumping onto a mat like 2 feet off the ground. Oh boy, the sharknado looks great. ... These guys do amazing work in (post-production)."" The ""Sharknado"" TV movies are not the first or last to take on the topic of vicious sharks attacking vulnerable humans (although, they are perhaps the first to have sharks soaring overhead in a tornado). The movies pay tribute to some of their predecessors while also trying to bring something new to the screen. Of course, the concept of an out-of-control ""Sharknado"" descending on the country's biggest cities is completely original, invented by director Anthony Ferrante. At least one star has said she thinks it's not beyond reality. Reid recently told GQ magazine she believes a sharknado is possible. ""You know, it actually can happen,"" she said. ""I mean, the chances of it happening are very rare, but it can happen actually. Which is crazy. Not that it -- the chances of it are, like, you know, it's like probably 'pigs could fly.' Like, I don't think pigs could fly, but actually sharks could be stuck in tornados. There could be a sharknado."" Syfy has already signed on for a third ""Sharknado"" movie. Screenwriter Levin predicts that after New York goes down, there might be a ""global Sharkapocalypse."" Levin has a few tips for the fans gearing up for ""Sharknado 2's"" big touchdown. ""You definitely have to watch it with friends,"" he said. ""I think alcohol would probably be a good ingredient. You need popcorn, to eat it and also throw at TV. And those inflatable air sharks floating around your house would be a great addition."" ""Sharknado 2: The Second One"" premieres at 9 p.m. ET Wednesday on Syfy.

"(CNN) -- ""Beyond the hedonism of tasting these wines -- and the hedonism of tasting these wines is going to be off the charts -- I think there will be two very important ideas that come out of this,"" says wine educator and ""The Wine Bible"" author Karen MacNeil as we share a bottle of Stony Hill 2012 Napa Valley Gewurztraminer over lunch. ""To see if the vintners themselves believe there is some reason that these wines scored as highly as they did; and to see if the people enrolled in the event think there is a ribbon going through the wine. ""Is there a commonality that causes a wine to be considered great?"" MacNeil is one of the top wine authorities in the United States -- ""The Wine Bible"" has sold 700,000 copies since 2000 -- and we're two of a privileged few taking part in a 1,000-point wine tasting event, featuring 10 Napa Valley wines that each received a perfect 100-point score from Robert M. Parker Jr. of ""The Wine Advocate."" ""Since Robert Parker began, there have been 369 wines in the world that have been given a perfect 100 score. ""Something like 130 of these are in the U.S. Of that 130, 119 are in California and of the 119, 68 are from the Napa Valley,"" says MacNeil. Located 60 miles northeast of San Francisco, Napa Valley is around 30 miles long and ranges from one to five miles wide -- about one-eighth the size of Bordeaux. Despite a 6.1-magnitude earthquake on August 24 that resulted in damage ranging from a few broken glasses to structural damage to some buildings and equipment, 2014 is already looking to be another excellent and abundant vintage. September is the most exciting time to visit. Fruity pickings . As wineries gear up for harvest, pickers move through sun-drenched vineyards, hand-dropping fruit to improve the quality of the final crop; equipment, already cleaned and prepared, stands idle at winery buildings, ready to process the fruit. The Napa Valley Experience -- organized by the nonprofit, 500-member Napa Valley Vintners association from September 7-10 -- is arguably the most sensational event taking place this harvest season. The experience includes tastings at some of the valley's most scenic and most celebrated wineries; home visits with prolific personalities; wine blending workshops; farm-to-table dining; and, the climax, the first public 1,000-point tasting ever to be held anywhere, as far as MacNeil or Napa Valley Vintners are aware. The vintages selected represent a cross-section of appellations. They were chosen exclusively from the 2000s; vintners rather than winemakers will attend the tasting, ensuring discussion is philosophical rather than chemical. The story of each wine -- and the magic of the experience -- are central to the experience. When I eat with celebrated vintner Michael Honig at Michael Chiarello's Bottega in the foodie mecca of upscale Yountville, he has a treat to share -- a bottle of the Honig 2010 Westside Trio Cabernet Sauvignon, a limited edition Premiere Napa Valley auction label, which he cradles in the crook of one elbow. ""We work with a number of different vineyards around the valley, as well as own our own, so when it comes to Premiere we take grapes from three different vineyards,"" says Honig. ""We call it the Westside Trio. We do not make this wine normally."" Marked Auction 16, lot 15, the label is also hand-initialed by winemaker Kristin Belair. ""Only 240 bottles were made,"" he adds, pouring the ruby red liquid into my glass. During a pit stop at my lodging for the next three nights -- the stunning, vintner-owned, forest-cocooned Meadowood property in St. Helena -- I have time to appreciate the events of the day and the beauty of my surroundings. From lush lowland orchards to lofty terraces overlooking lush green alleys, Napa is filled with pretty views. Real farmland . When I join vintner Agustin Huneeus at his terra-cotta-colored home within Quintessa's vineyards, he offers me a cup of tea and explains why the aesthetics of the region -- accentuated by Valley's organic development and agricultural land trust -- are special. ""There is real farming here, it's not Disneyland -- it's real,"" he says. ""Vines started developing, the people starting coming, then Napa started something that in the world now is pretty prevalent -- opening the cellars to tourists. ""Bob Mondavi and Mike Martini ... a couple of them started it, and then everybody did it."" We embark on an ATV tour of the vineyards that produce Quintessa's single blend, crafted to be the perfect expression of the terroir. ""Napa is unique in the world and in America, particularly. The hills, the climate -- we have a great climate, by the way -- and the beauty of the place."" Located on Pritchard Hill, Chappellet is another vineyard where spectacular views and a feeling of being connected to the landscape are integral to the experience. Marketing manager Blakesley Chappellet greets me at the foyer to its cavernous wooden winery pyramid. ""Artist Ed Moses crafted a cardboard pyramid in the Sixties and then engineers figured out how to build it,"" she explains, before leading me to a vintage Swiss Army Pinzgauer truck. She revs the engine and we start climbing through the original 1967 terraces to the meadow, a springy carpet of lush grass shaded by breeze-stirred towering trees above vines that sweep down the slope to the lake at the bottom of the valley. This will be the setting for a private Napa Valley Experience harvest party on the final night of the event. ""I could go into family-owned, solar-powered, certified organic, but I really want people to feel this place and to come away and realize that they've been somewhere really special, both because of the stewardship and because of the magic of the property itself,"" says Chappellet. Vine tastings . Looking over the vines, especially in the slight lull before harvest, it's easy to forget that this is a working farm designed to ensure the grapes have everything they need to produce world-class wines. St. Supery CEO Emma Swain and vineyard manager Josh Anstey show me what happens out among the Dollarhide Ranch vines on a day-to-day basis. As early morning sun turns the vines on the slopes to gold, we stop at cabernet sauvignon vines. Anstey hands me a booklet based on Lucie Morton's study of ampelography so that I can compare a leaf to the blown-up illustration on the page. ""She says it looks like a monkey face or mask -- see its hole-punched appearance?"" she says, before greeting a team precision-grafting rootstock and bud to produce new sauvignon blanc vines come spring. We try the grapes from one vine, then one adjacent, tasting the difference in sweetness in vines before squeezing a berry onto a refractometer for a more precise measurement of the sugars. Then we cruise up a grassy ridge to where guest experience manager F. Scott Tracey -- former wine director at Michelin-starred La Toque -- has already laid a table with sky blue linen, five wines and bite-size pairings overlooking the mirror-like lake. There was just one more aspect of winemaking to experience -- the blending. At Hall Rutherford, after a discussion of the philosophy behind the winemaking process, Mike Reynolds, Hall Wines Napa Valley president and winemaker, and owner Kathryn Hall, pose a challenge -- to blend my own version of the Kathryn Hall cabernet from the barrel provided. I follow the team into a futuristic-looking barrel room where a red neon art installation reflects off hand-etched trapezoid Geiger barrels and along the cool corridors to the tasting room. ""Mike and Mrs. Hall will award a prize to the winning blend,"" says manager Laura Garrow. Game on!

"Dongshigu Village, China (CNN) -- As our car moved closer to this tiny village in eastern China, our driver became visibly nervous, looking around for any signs of trouble. He found it. ""They spotted us,"" he said, hitting the gas. In the rear-view mirror, an unmarked black sedan appeared out of nowhere, trailing us as we drove past the main entrance to Dongshigu Village. That's the hometown of Chen Guangcheng, a prominent human rights activist whose escape here last week from house arrest has set off diplomatic reverberations worldwide. Who is Chen? Orange traffic cones blocked the narrow path off the main road; a half-dozen burly men stood guard with numerous vehicles parked behind them. Despite the green trees and fields, the tight security around Dongshigu looked no different from what it looked like during the past two winters, when we previously had tried to enter the village. In February and December of last year, we had come here to visit Chen after he recounted in a video posted online the abuse he and his family suffered during their confinement at the hands of local officials. Each time we were turned back at checkpoints, where plainclothes guards hurled rocks or or threw punches at us. Chen, 40, a blind and self-taught legal advocate for alleged forced-abortion victims, escaped last week after being imprisoned at home for more than 18 months. He is now believed to be in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, creating a burgeoning diplomatic dilemma between China and the United States that coincides with a visit by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. She arrived Wednesday morning in Beijing. Chen affair could overshadow U.S.-China talks . Chen's wife, mother and daughter, who were incarcerated with him but did not escape, have vanished from public view. In a video released online Friday, Chen expressed his deepening worry for the safety of his family. ""They have been persecuting my family for a long time and my escape would only prompt them into a mode of revenge,"" he said. We had come here again on Tuesday to find Chen's family -- but couldn't get close. With the black sedan tailing us, our driver refused to slow down. He overtook trucks on the wrong side of the main road and raced through open-air markets on bumpy dirt paths. We had hired him in a nearby town -- and it had taken a lot of cajoling to persuade him to take the job. ""It's too risky,"" he protested en route to Dongshigu. ""I've heard of Chen Guangcheng -- he campaigned against the family-planning policy and was under house arrest."" ""I don't know too much,"" he added quickly. ""You should ask people from his town -- they know all about him."" After an hour's high-speed car chase, during which our driver failed to shake our tail, he decided he'd had enough. He dropped us off near a gas station, then he sped off as three policemen approached his car. While waiting for a new car, we chatted with a trucker who had told us he was from Chen's town, but offered little news. ""Chen Guangcheng?"" he asked, appearing uncomfortable hearing the name. ""I spend a lot of time away and don't know much about what's going on here."" As we started driving in a new car, our tail resumed its close surveillance. This time, instead of trying to lose them, we decided to try to discover their intention. We stopped at a roadside farmer's stall, where I bought a watermelon. Then, CNN's Stan Grant and I -- each of us carrying a slice of watermelon as a sort of peace offering -- approached the Volkswagen Passat carrying our pursuers as cameraman Brad Olson shot video of the scene that was unfolding. The two men seated in the front of the car covered their faces with their hands and ignored my knocking on the driver's window. I then knocked on the backseat passenger window. A man sporting a white shirt and sunglasses rolled down the tinted window slightly. He refused to identify himself, but denied following us. ""We were just driving around for fun,"" he said. ""Is this about Chen Guangcheng?"" Stan asked in English and I translated. ""I don't know who Chen Guangcheng is,"" he replied. ""Do you want a slice of watermelon?"" I offered. ""No."" He looked awkward, rolling up the window. As we walked away, someone yelled ""Stop!"" from behind. Turning around, we saw that all three men had gotten out of the car and were rushing toward us. Scuffling ensued as they tried to grab Brad's camera from his hands. Amid the chaos, we broke free with our camera and jumped into our car. One of the men picked up the watermelon I had bought and launched it at our car. With pink juice splashed across the rear window and the black car behind us again, we sped off toward the expressway back to Beijing -- wondering about Chen's escape and his family's fate.","A CNN team attempts to visit Chen Guangcheng's hometown of Dongshigu .

"(CNN) -- When an official from the Internal Revenue Service decides to take the Fifth before a congressional committee and is then put on administrative leave, as Lois Lerner was recently, hearts on the political right surely beat a little faster. Does this mean that at least one of the controversies swirling around the Obama administration in recent weeks will gain strength, perhaps enough to pull him under? So far it appears that the administration's trio of troubles -- the IRS's scrutiny of the tea party, the Justice Department's investigation of journalists, and the State Department's handling of the Benghazi attacks -- lack some of the key ingredients required to brew a strong scandal, the kind that does some serious damage, that produces widespread public interest and intense emotional involvement, and stains an administration, leaving its mark on history. The IRS controversy and Lerner drama stokes the sense of crisis in Washington. But Americans are hardly alone in discovering troubling developments in high places. The world is awash in scandals, partly the result of new technologies. In countries where people have long felt they had no voice, the powerful are feeling new public scrutiny. The most resonant scandals take an already-existing concern and turn it into a concrete story, one that gets the popular blood boiling. To gain traction, it must demonstrate a clear-cut example of abuse of power that is part of a pattern, not just an isolated instance of incompetence, stupidity or poor judgment. It must lead directly to a powerful individual, and must represent a problem that is viewed as having serious implications, even if the case itself is not necessarily consequential. Of the three controversies brewing in the U.S., the IRS affair has the greatest potential to get the public emotionally involved, because the tax agency has power over everyone. Bureaucratic overreach feels potentially threatening to all. A higher-stakes example can be found in the case of the impoverished Tunisian street vendor Mohammed Bouazizi. In 2010, after a municipal employee confiscated his produce, Bouazizi, despairing at the injustice and his own powerlessness, set himself on fire. His case resonated. It was a minor instance in the larger scheme of corruption and dictatorship, but it sparked a revolutionary fire that keeps burning to this day across the Middle East and North Africa. In Mexico, an incident that in the past would have passed without notice spread rapidly over the Internet, ultimately requiring presidential action. The daughter of the head of the consumer protection agency showed up at the trendy Maximo Bistrot in the capital without a reservation. When she could not get a table, she threatened to have the place shut down. Officials from her father's agency, known as Profeco, promptly raided the establishment. ""Lady Profeco,"" as Andrea Benitez came to be known, became the personification of the super-entitled member of the elite, a character Mexicans know well and have long resented. Benitez's image, holding a cell phone to her ear and wearing fashionable sunglasses, spread in online parodies. Last week, Mexico's president fired her father. In the U.S., the unfolding storylines are raising hopes among the president's critics -- and fear among his supporters -- that they will derail his presidency or at least snuff out his second-term agenda. They involve unquestionably important issues: The government undermines the First Amendment when the Justice Department spies on reporters. If the IRS is targeting groups because they oppose government policies, that is a clear and egregious abuse of power. And the disaster in Libya raises important questions about security and transparency. And yet, Americans as a whole don't appear to view these cases as emblematic of a particular problem with the current presidency. Polls show most Americans -- 58% -- still view Obama as ""honest and trustworthy."" An even greater number, 79%, consider the president likable. That explains why even though most Americans consider the cases ""very important to the nation,"" the approval rating for Obama has not suffered. This presents a challenge to those who want to see the scandals demolish the Obama presidency and shut down his agenda. A scandal loses some of its power to demolish when it is viewed as a political game. All this, of course, could change. An official's decision to invoke the right against self-incrimination certainly adds to the air of suspicion. But when the president's image does not fit neatly with the revelations in a potential scandal, then the facts of the case, the continuing drops of new information, must have the power to redraw that image.

"You've been told for years that popping a multivitamin every day might help you live longer. But the daily multi habit has been getting a bit of bad press lately. Vitamins can help provide key nutrients for individuals whose diets are low on fruits and veggies. First, ConsumerLab.com, a watchdog of the supplement industry, found that more than half of the 21 multis it tested had too much (or too little) of certain vitamins -- or had been contaminated with dangerous substances such as lead. Then a controversial paper from researchers in Denmark and other European countries, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, made the claim that taking vitamins may actually shorten your life. What's the real story? Health talked to leading nutrition experts at Harvard and Tufts universities to find out and to get some answers on this and other confusing info about vitamins. Are multivitamins safe? Vitamins have been recommended for years because they help you get key nutrients if your diet's low on fruits and veggies -- and may even help prevent cancer and heart disease. And it's unlikely that one critical paper (speculating that vitamin supplements might upset your body's natural healing process and boost your risk of death) will change that. Health.com: Your vitamin cheat sheet . Longtime vitamin experts at Tufts University and the Linus Pauling Institute at Oregon State University continue to say multis aren't dangerous and the paper's findings are wrong. The paper analyzed previous studies, including many with people who were sick before taking vitamins, so there's a good chance vitamins weren't responsible for shortening their lives. Experts say the paper also ignored two major studies that found vitamins reduced the risk of death. At the same time, the study from ConsumerLab.com shows that you can't assume just any vitamin is safe. Because there are no uniform manufacturing rules for supplements, a multi may not contain what the bottle claims, could be contaminated with something from the manufacturing plant, or might have tainted ingredients. Health.com: 20 antioxidant powerhouses . Your best bet: Avoid the vitamins singled out by ConsumerLab.com, and stick with mainstream names such as Centrum Silver and One-A-Day Women's, which were found to be free of impurities and accurately labeled. Also, check vitamin bottles for the United States Pharmacopoeia (USP), NSF International (NSF), or ConsumerLab.com (CL) seals. The USP and NSF are nonprofit groups that verify whether companies offer contamination-free products and use good manufacturing practices. Not every brand has the seals -- some don't want to submit to testing--but those that do (Kirkland and Nature Made carry the USP seal, for instance) are reliable. How much should I spend to get the biggest benefits? Price isn't a sign of quality. In fact, some of the priciest vitamins -- like The Greatest Vitamin in the World and Eniva Vibe, which cost more than $39.95 per bottle -- failed the Consumer Lab.com tests. A mainstream brand such as One-A-Day Women's is $8.99 for a bottle of 100 tablets at drugstore.com, about 9 cents per day. How do I find the right multi for me? In your childbearing years, make sure your multi has 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid, which helps make and maintain new cells. And pregnant women should take a vitamin with 600 mcg of folic acid daily; this nutrient also reduces the incidence of neural tube birth defects such as spina bifida. A premenopausal woman should look for a multivitamin with iron to replace the iron lost during menstruation. Menopausal women should go without the iron. ""Too much iron may raise the risk of heart disease,"" says Meir Stampfer, Ph.D., professor of nutrition and epidemiology at Harvard School of Public Health. Health.com: A new way to ""pop"" your vitamins . If you're taking a prescription, check with your doctor about risky interactions. (Vitamin E, for instance, may be a problem if you're taking a blood thinner.) If you're a cancer patient, you should ask your doctor about risks before taking vitamins. ""Cancer cells need vitamins to grow, too,"" Stampfer says. Plus, some vitamins can interfere with chemotherapy. What's the best way to avoid that queasy feeling after taking a multi? ""Consider switching brands,"" Stampfer suggests. Trial and error is the best way to determine which brands won't break down poorly in your stomach and lead to irritation. Also, take your multi with food because your body needs some fat (or lipids) to absorb some of the individual vitamins. The delivery method (pill, liquid, gummy bear) makes no difference. But vitamins in liquid form may degrade more quickly on the shelf. How much of each vitamin should my multi have? The amount per serving numbers on the label should match the government's Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI). It's OK if they're higher as long as they don't exceed the tolerable upper limit (UL). (To find the DRIs and ULs, go to Health.com/links.) While most vitamins are listed in milligrams (mg) or micrograms (mcg), the label may use IUs (international units) for vitamins A, D, and E. The DRIs are 2,300 IUs for vitamin A, 200 for D, and 22 for E. What about the label's % Daily Value column? Look at it with a skeptical eye: Those numbers haven't been updated since 1968.

"(CNN) -- Explosive new allegations surfaced about embattled Toronto Mayor Rob Ford in court documents released Wednesday -- the same day the city council voted to ask him to take a leave of absence. The court report, more than 500 pages long, alleges a pattern of drug use, and erratic and sometimes abusive behavior by the mayor. A judge ordered the report's release late last month. The documents include police interviews with former staff members, information obtained from surveillance crews and cameras, and even an examination of the mayor's garbage. The documents were used by Canadian police to get a search warrant for Alexander Lisi, Ford's friend and occasional driver, whom police accuse of marijuana possession and trafficking. Several staffers said they were asked to buy alcohol for the mayor. One incident described by a former staffer alleged that Ford, while driving, stopped the vehicle, guzzled some vodka, and drove on. Chris Fickel, who worked as a special assistant to Ford, said the mayor would ask him to perform odd jobs at his house. Fickel said he would be called ""to change light bulbs in the front lawn, change batteries in his children's toys, buying cartons of cigarettes, bleach, laundry detergent and diet Coke for the mayor's wife."" One staffer told police the mayor was inebriated on St. Patrick's Day in 2012 and got into a physical altercation with two staff members. He alleges the mayor was verbally abusive and inappropriate with a female staff member. Another staffer said the same night, he saw a woman who may have been an escort or prostitute in the mayor's office. Ford's former press secretary George Christopoulos also said women often came to the mayor's office, ""and told staffers that they have smoked a joint with the mayor on the street outside of the bar. These women were told by the mayor that they could have a job."" Christopoulos would then have to interview these women and try to talk them out of a job. None of the allegations against Ford has been proven, and he faces no criminal charges. Ford vows to stay on the job . Despite the Toronto City Council's motion, the mayor of Canada's largest city insists he will stay on the job. Wednesday's vote is largely symbolic -- it does not have the power to force Ford from his post. The tense council meeting came more than a week after Ford admitted smoking crack cocaine. Days after that admission, a new video showed a ranting, swearing Ford threatening to kill someone. Toronto mayor's rant caught on video . During Wednesday's meeting, Ford made a further confession to the council. He said he has purchased illegal drugs within the past two years, while he was in office. Despite his escalating troubles, Ford insists he has been a good mayor and that voters will decide during next year's election whether to keep him. ""I have made a mistake. I am human,"" he said. ""I apologize. I want to move on."" Ford said that he is being subjected to a ""public flogging"" and that the experience has been the most humiliating thing in his life, maybe the worst week in his life next to his father's death. Despite the admission of drug use and of heavy drinking, Ford flatly denied that he is addicted to alcohol or drugs. ""The reason I drank or did drugs was not because of stress, it was out of sheer stupidity,"" he said. ""That's all it was."" Ford's brother, Councilor Doug Ford, and other family members have defended the embattled mayor. On Wednesday, Doug Ford appeared on CNN and blamed the scandal on politics. ""Rob does not come into work drunk,"" he told CNN. ""He said he's tried illicit drugs under a drunken stupor."" ""And he's not doing drugs. And he's not drinking. So he's moving in the right direction, in my opinion, but the public flogging, never seen anything like it. This man has apologized profusely. He's asked for forgiveness, and the rest is sheer politics down here."" He's not Teflon, but to 'Ford Nation,' Toronto mayor is still their man .

"(CNN) -- Russia is in the midst of its biggest war games since Soviet times, with 160,000 troops, 130 planes, 70 ships and thousands of tanks and armored vehicles participating in the country's Far East, according to media reports. Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the drills last Friday and they began that night, according to reports from the RIA Novosti news agency. Putin flew to Sakhalin island off the eastern coast to oversee the games on Tuesday, Russia's presidential press service reported. ""The main purpose of the activities is to check the readiness of the military units to perform assigned tasks and evaluate of the level of personnel's training and technical preparation as well as the level of equipment of units with arms and military equipment,"" the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement reported by Russian Television. ""The Sakhalin part of the maneuvers was intended to simulate a response to a hypothetical attack by Japanese and U.S. forces,"" Konstantin Sivkov, who is retired from the Russian military's General Staff, told the Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper, according to a report from the BBC. But Russia's deputy defense minister, Anatoly Antonov, said the games were designed to ""enhance the army's combat readiness"" and were not directed against any specific nations, the BBC reported. Some of the units involved in the exercises moved more than 3,000 kilometers (1,800 miles) from their bases to participate, according to the Russian media reports. The current drills, which are expected to last through the week, are the latest in a series of snap exercises conducted by the Russian military this year, Russian Television reported. Similar drills have been conducted in the country's west, south and central military districts, the report said.","President Putin oversees games from Sakhalin island .

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- A series of recent fires in at least five detention centers around the country has raised questions about living conditions in Turkey's prison system. Late Saturday night a fire broke out in the dormitory of a prison in the southeastern province of Sanliurfa. The fire claimed the lives of 13 prisoners and injured five others before authorities successfully extinguished the blaze. Prisoners reportedly set fire to their mattresses to protest cramped and unsuitable living conditions. A day after the first protest blaze was put out, prisoners in the same prison once again set fires in the dormitories, this time injuring 42, according to the semi-official Anatolian Agency. The latest prison fire occurred Tuesday in the southern province of Karaman. There were no casualties but inmates had to be evacuated to the prison yard. On Monday, similar fires were reported at other detention facilities, including prisons in Gaziantep, Adana and Osmaniye. ""Overcrowding is the primary problem,"" said Ozturk Turkdogan, president of the Human Rights Foundation in Turkey, or IHD, pointing out that the Sanliurfa prison is equipped to house 375 prisoners but currently houses nearly 1,200. The cell where the fire started was furnished with six beds but housed 18 prisoners, according to an IHD report. ""When I was in the prison, at first we were six people in a six-person room, which was fine. But then, two by two they put more people in. Ultimately, we were 14 people living in the room,"" said Cemal Babaoglu, who spent three months in the prison last year awaiting trial. Such overcrowding is not a new problem in Turkey, according to officials. ""This is a problem that evolves from the past (but is) getting smaller as (we) head into the future. The steps that we have taken in order to minimize and eventually eliminate the problem are evident,"" said Justice Minister Sadullah Ergin at a press conference on Tuesday. Turkey is in the process of upgrading its prison system and will increase its capacity nearly twofold by 2017, according to officials. The primary reason for overcrowding in Turkish prisons is a judicial system that errs on the side of detention rather than releasing the accused on bail before and during legal proceedings, and a new penal code that has lengthened prison sentences. According to the justice ministry, 27.5% of prisoners are detainees awaiting the outcome of their trials. But Turkdogan maintains that 41% of all prisoners in Turkey are either awaiting trial or a decision from an appellate court, a situation made more problematic, he says, by the fact that over half of appealed convictions are eventually overturned. According to Human Rights Watch researcher Emma Sinclair-Webb, it is not only the problem of overcrowding, which is present in many of the world's penal systems, but also the lack of transparency that prevents prison conditions in Turkey from conforming to accepted international standards. ""Human rights groups and (nongovernmental organizations) cannot visit prisons easily without lengthy procedures,"" said Sinclair-Webb. ""Turkey lacks a regular system of independent monitors."" Experts who are in the best position to identify and prevent hazardous conditions are thus unable to make firsthand observations, reducing pressure that might otherwise accelerate improvements to basic necessities such as medical care and infrastructure. ""The capacity to respond to these complaints, to take measures to prevent the kind of tragedy that happened at the (Sanliurfa) prison, we are not seeing at the moment,"" said Sinclair-Webb. Sanliurfa prison has been in the headlines before. After his requests for a transfer were denied, an inmate who lit himself on fire in protest of living conditions died in July 2010.","A weekend fire at one prison in Turkey killed 13 inmates .

"(CNN) -- European football's governing body has opened fresh disciplinary proceedings against Croatia over alleged racist behavior by its supporters during a Euro 2012 match against Spain. UEFA cited the ""improper conduct of supporters (display of racist banners and symbols)"" by Croatia fans during the game in Gdansk on Monday. Croatia, which was eliminated from Euro 2012 after losing the match 1-0, has already been admonished twice during Euro 2012 over the conduct of its fans. Wednesday's Uefa statement read: ""Uefa has today opened disciplinary proceedings against the Croatian Football Federation (HNS) for the setting-off and throwing of fireworks, and the improper conduct of supporters (display of racist banners and symbols) at the EURO 2012 Group C match against Spain in Gdansk on Monday. ""The disciplinary case also involves the improper conduct of the team (six Croatian players received a yellow card during the match)."" The UEFA Control and Disciplinary Body will deal with the case on Sunday, it said. Croatia was fined 80,000 Euros on Monday after Italy striker Mario Balotelli was racially abused by fans during a previous match. And last week, the HNS was fined after supporters let off flares during the game against Republic of Ireland. The issue of racism has threatened to mar Euro 2012, which is being co-hosted by Poland and Ukraine. Members of the Dutch squad claimed to hear monkey noises during an open training session in Krakow, Poland, before the tournament started, though the Dutch FA opted not to lodge an official complaint with UEFA. In addition, family members of two black English players chose not to travel to the competition for fear of being subjected to racism. UEFA has already taken the step of writing a letter to the mayors of each host city asking for a zero-tolerance approach to racist abuse. Uefa also fined England's Football Association 5,000 Euros on Wednesday over the ""inappropriate conduct"" of fans in last week's Euro 2012 match against Sweden. The fine related to an attempted pitch invasion by English supporters after England won the match in Kiev, Ukraine.","Croatian Football Federation in trouble over fan behavior for third time at Euro 2012 .

"Istanbul (CNN) -- In a further escalation of tensions between Israel and Turkey, at least three Israeli diplomats are being expelled from the Israeli Embassy in Ankara, Israeli officials said Wednesday. The Israeli consulate, however, appears to be unaffected by the Turkish downgrade of diplomatic relations with Israel. ""Consulates and embassies are not in the same status,"" said Ohad Kaynar of the Israeli consulate in Istanbul. ""There are treaties that define what consulates are supposed to do. The personnel that are being expelled are from the embassy. As of now, we have not heard anything from the Turkish foreign ministry regarding expulsion of any of the consulate personnel."" On Tuesday, Turkey's fiery prime minister compared Ankara's once-close ally in the Middle East to a ""spoiled boy"" and announced additional sanctions would soon be imposed. ""We are completely suspending all of these, trade relations, military relations, related with the defense industry,"" Recep Tayyip Erdogan said, according to the semi-official Anatolian Agency. ""All of these are completely suspended and other measures will follow this process."" Asked to clarify whether this meant Turkey will halt more than $3 billion in bilateral trade, an official in the Turkish prime ministry, speaking on condition of anonymity under government protocol, insisted Erdogan was not referring to trade relations. ""He was referring to the defense industry,"" the official said. ""Nothing more than the measures that have been announced so far."" Last week, Turkey declared it was downgrading relations with Israel, suspending all military agreements between the two countries and giving senior Israeli diplomats less than a week to leave Turkish territory. ""If the current steps are regarded as 'plan B,' there will be a 'plan C,'"" Erdogan said on Tuesday in his first public comments on the matter since Ankara imposed sanctions on Israel. Erdogan's government is incensed that Israel refuses to apologize or pay compensation for eight slain Turks and one Turkish-American. The humanitarian workers and activists were shot dead by Israeli commandos in a botched 2010 raid on an aid convoy that was trying to bust Israel's sea blockade of Gaza. But ""Israel does not want to see a further deterioration in the relationship with Turkey,"" said a senior Israeli government official, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue. ""There have been a number of proposals on the table to prevent a deterioration and unfortunately they have not been successful, but from our point of view a deterioration in the relationship serves neither side's interests."" Multiple Israeli sources said they are doing what they can to be responsible and reverse the negative dynamic. Some Israeli officials believe the current troubles between the two countries are minor bumps that can be smoothed out with time and the proper diplomacy. Others believe the deteriorating relationship has little to do with Israel and more to do with a reorientation of Turkish foreign policy towards the Muslim world. A possible Erdogan trip to Gaza is contributing to that school of thought. Diplomats in Cairo and Ankara tell CNN that Erdogan is tentatively scheduled to visit Cairo next week. There is growing speculation in local media that the Turkish prime minister may try to visit Gaza via Egypt's Rafah border crossing. ""This is a process that will continue until the last moment,"" Erdogan said Tuesday, according to Anatolian, when asked about a trip to Gaza. ""We will make the final decision there, talking to our Egyptian friends and brothers. According to that, there may be a trip to Gaza."" Despite deteriorating political relations between Jerusalem and Ankara, trade has grown substantially between the two countries over the last year, according to Turkish government statistics. On Monday, Stanley Fischer, governor of the Bank of Israel, gave a speech in which he highlighted the importance of Israel's economic ties with Turkey. He noted that Turkey's economy was the largest in the region, with a gross domestic product in excess of $700 billion, and that Turkey is becoming a key player in regional trade. Turkey is a significant Israeli trading partner, Fischer said, and damage to the trade relationship between the two countries could have serious consequences for Israel. Yigal Schleifer, Washington-based editor at Eurasianet and expert on Turkish-Israeli relations, argues the Middle Eastern ""outsider"" status that once drew Turkey and Israel together into an alliance during the 1990s has changed, as Turkey has grown economically and established closer political ties with Arab neighbors. ""The paths have diverged,"" Schleifer said. ""What you have left is two countries with different visions currently for their position in the region. So Turkey wants to build a more unified region with more open borders that ultimately helps trade and ultimately helps Turkey see itself as a regional leader. Israel sees itself as isolated in the region, increasingly threatened and increasingly concerned with security issues."" Prior to the report about Erdogan's comments Tuesday, Amos Gilad, a senior Israeli defense official, told Israeli radio that despite the reports, Turkey is not disengaging from Israel. Contrary to what is being reported, he said, the Israeli military attache to Turkey is continuing his work there.","The Israeli consulate appears to be unaffected .

"(CNN) -- More than half a million people a year flock to the Blue Mountains National Park, Australia's most accessible wilderness, to see its impressive peaks and ancient rainforest. But Australia is grappling with a dilemma: how to balance conservation with the need for tourist spending. ""Although it looks gorgeous and beautiful it is a park under pressure -- there are a lot of vulnerable species in this national park,"" said Tara Cameron, a local teacher and President of Blue Mountains Conservation Society. ""It's not a completely resilient piece of nature we can do anything with."" Maintaining wilderness is an expensive business, and visitor numbers have fallen in recent years. The number of trips including an overnight stay has almost halved in the last decade, from 1.045 million in 1999, according to Tourism Research Australia figures quoted in the Sydney Daily Telegraph. They show an 18 percent drop in one year, from 687,000 in 2008 to 563,000 last year. The New South Wales government now wants to increase both tourist numbers and spending by attracting visitors interested in a more comfortable, less rugged experience. Its tourism strategy has attracted criticism for refusing to rule out development within the park. Mark Jarvis, who runs a hotel in Katoomba, the main tourist town in the Blue Mountains, just an hour and a half from Sydney, said: ""We're very concerned because the uniqueness of area revolves around the fact that we sit in between World Heritage parks. ""So the fact that they are looking at developing, the fact that if there is a potential to do it, it's not right for this area. ""It's not in Sydney's interests to see this area develop -- the attraction for Sydney people to come here is our lack of development."" Cameron agreed: ""What I see happening in New South Wales is a distraction and diversion away from nature conservation as the primary purpose of parks -- and if we don't focus on that the standards and the state of our parks will slowly decline."" However, Randal Walker, chairman of Blue Mountains Tourism, argued that it is possible to develop sustainable tourism without damaging the natural beauty that visitors come to see. ""If there was increased interest in development, I think those investors would only do it in terms of: is it sustainable?"" said Walker. ""Is there going to be a return on investment? And it's going to be in built-up areas where zoning allows it. I don't think there would be any development that would be a negative impact on the environment."" ""We have to have a sustainable impact on the natural asset, which all tourism operators value and treasure and want to preserve."" Penelope Figgis, a government advisor on conservation and tourism, also believes the park has to develop. She said: ""Everybody is looking for how we can make national parks relevant into the future. We have very urbanized population who are not as connected with nature. ""The New South Wales government wanted to see how we could connect with nature but also at the same time stimulate regional economies through tourism activities related to nature conservation. ""I can't think of a better way to persuade somebody to be an advocate for a beautiful and wild area than going there and immersing themselves in that experience,"" she added. The danger in this quest for something new, is turning nature into a commodity, argued Cameron. ""I think national parks and nature is worth more than just being the new thing, the sort of new product,"" she said. ""We have 92 percent of the state of New South Wales that is taken up by people. ""Only eight percent is national park. They're the bits that we've put aside for nature -- do we really need to encroach on those as well. ""The coffee shop is not an endangered species. Humans are doing very well -- we are looking after ourselves very well. At some point we need to say: 'When is it nature's turn?'""

"Rome, Italy (CNN) -- Pope Benedict XVI is expected to sign a decree on Saturday that will put his predecessor, Pope John Paul II, a step closer to sainthood. The Diocese of Rome's press office said Friday that the pontiff is expected to approve the ""heroic virtues"" of John Paul II and then declare him ""venerable."" A miracle attributed to his intervention will have to be verified for the late pope to be declared ""blessed,"" or beatified. A second miracle would have to be confirmed for him to then be officially canonized, or made a saint. John Paul II died on April 2, 2005, at age 84. Several months after his death, his successor said he had dispensed with rules that normally impose a five-year waiting period before beatification. The rule is intended to allow time for evidence and witnesses supporting the sainthood cause to be prepared, as well as to wait for emotions to dissipate after death. But John Paul himself set a precedent in 1999 when he granted a dispensation and let Mother Teresa's sainthood cause begin two years after her death. CNN's Hada Messia contributed to this report.","Pope expected to approve ""heroic virtues"" of John Paul II, declare him ""venerable""

"(CNN) -- Mom-to-be Maggie Baumann knew she most definitely would not be ""eating for two."" She couldn't. During her first pregnancy, she was extremely preoccupied with just how many calories she consumed and stuck to a very strict exercise routine. ""Getting on the scale at the doctor's office was very triggering for me,"" said Baumann of Newport Beach, California, who is now an eating disorders specialist and trauma therapist who devotes some of her practice to pregnant women and moms suffering from eating disorders. She gained 32 pounds during her first pregnancy, which is very much in line with the 25 to 35 pounds doctors say, on average, a woman who is expecting should gain. But, during her second pregnancy, she was not going to let ""that"" happen again, she said in an interview. 'Pregorexia' ""I was just like, I am not doing that again, I am not getting that big. I am not getting that out of control,"" said Baumann, who first went public about her experience in a blog in 2009 and is now co-writing a chapter on pregnancy and eating disorders in a book to be published in 2014. She didn't realize it at the time but she was one of a number of women with an extreme obsession with weight during pregnancy, battling what has become known as ""pregorexia."" Pregorexia is not a formally recognized medical diagnosis. It is a term coined by the media, public and doctors in recent years to describe the eating disorder behaviors experienced by women while pregnant, which could include intense dieting and exercise, but also binging and purging. 30% of pregnant women in U.S. don't gain enough . While there are no known statistics on just how many pregnant women experience pregorexia, it is estimated that about 30% of American women don't gain enough weight during pregnancy, according to Dr. Ovidio Bermudez, the chief medical officer at the Eating Recovery Center in Denver, Colorado. ""I think you've got to be careful not to overdraw conclusions,"" Bermudez said. He wanted to make clear that not every woman who ""struggles with weight gain"" during pregnancy has an eating disorder. ""But I think there is a significant number for whom this is really another struggle, another manifestation of their eating disorder-related pathology. And those are probably the folks that are going to take it more to an extreme and the folks more likely to suffer their own health consequences as well as putting their pregnancy and the fetus, the baby, at risk,"" he said. In Baumann's case, she began intense and extended workouts, and she was not eating enough. At 11 weeks, after she experienced bleeding in her uterus, her doctor, fearing she could miscarry, instructed her to stop all exercise immediately. She didn't because she couldn't. At seven months, there were worries the baby was too small and wasn't getting enough nutrients. ""It did not register to me like, 'OK, now I need to start trying for this baby,'"" said Baumann. ""I was like, 'Oh well, I won't go to the gym ... I'll just go and exercise somewhere else. I'm doing what I'm supposed to be doing but not really.'"" It was her secret. No one knew about the extended workouts, the calorie restriction, the eating disorder behaviors she battled throughout her life and now again as a mom-to-be. No one knew how horrible she felt about herself. ""The biggest factor is the shame because what mom ... would be restricting her calories or over-exercising and hurting her baby?"" said Baumann. Celebrity media culture plays a role . It has almost become a given now in our tabloid and celebrity media-obsessed culture, said Claire Mysko, spokeswoman for the National Eating Disorders Association, that any time a celebrity is pregnant, there will be a 24/7 focus on how much weight she gains and how quickly she loses it. Think Kate Middleton. Beyonce. Victoria Beckham. ""Between 2003 and 2005, the number of baby-related, baby weight-related covers on tabloids doubled and since then, it's almost become an expectation now that if a celebrity is pregnant, there will be a mention of her body during pregnancy and then there's the countdown to how fast she's going to get the weight off,"" said Mysko, co-author of the book ""Does this Pregnancy Make Me Look Fat?"" In interviews with more than 400 women for her book, Mysko said she and her co-author looked at the impact of this media coverage on women, who increasingly feel the pressure to have the ""perfect"" pregnancy and quickly get their bodies back. ""I think that absolutely has an effect on women and it absolutely fuels, I think, and validates this obsession with weight during pregnancy and after,"" said Mysko. ""We can't necessarily make a direct connection between whether that has increased the rate or the incidence of eating disorders, but certainly it has amped up this anxiety that women feel."" Women who had eating disorders more at risk . Women like Baumann, who battled eating disorders earlier in their lives, are much more likely to suffer from eating disorders while pregnant, experts say. ""I would say for women who know that they have a history of poor body image and disordered eating to really take that seriously as they enter into pregnancy and to be up-front about that history with your prenatal and post-partum health care providers,"" said Mysko. Women who might have some concerns can always contact the National Eating Disorders Association helpline, she said. But an eating disorder in your past doesn't guarantee you'll have one during pregnancy. In fact, Mysko, who had an eating disorder in her teens, found that she appreciated her body in a new way during pregnancy. Her daughter is 3 now. I had a similar experience. Like so many, I battled bulimia in college and still have small bouts of binge eating, even now in my 40s. But during my two pregnancies, I felt better about myself and my body than really at any other time in my life. Lack of acceptance should be the ""warning sign"" that a mom-to-be could be experiencing or on the brink of eating disorder behavior, said Bermudez of the Eating Recovery Center, who is a former chairman of the National Eating Disorders Association. ""So, if the dialogue instead of 'Gee, is my baby going to be healthy and what am I going to name him or her?' becomes 'What does this mean for me and what am I going to look like? And are you still going to love me?' especially to an exaggerated degree, one has to begin to say there is an issue with acceptance here,"" he said. 'I felt like I did this to her' When Baumann delivered her second child, she had gained only 18 pounds, compared to the 32 she gained during her first pregnancy. Her daughter developed seizures during the first months of her life, which her doctor said were possibly connected to the poor nutrition she received in the womb. ""'I felt like I did this to her, and I blamed myself and my eating disorder got worse,"" said Baumann. Nearly 10 years later, she finally got treatment by going to the Remuda Ranch in Arizona, a residential treatment center for women with anorexia and bulimia. Her daughter, now in her 20s and perfectly healthy, was angry at her mother when she found out what she had done during the pregnancy. ""I had to let her be angry at me,"" said Baumann. ""She had to process knowing that I did this and thinking, 'Why wouldn't my mom feed me?'"" ""Even coming from her end, it's unbelievable because if you don't have an eating disorder, it's very hard to understand,"" she said. Baumann, who devotes most of her time to the issue of eating disorders, is teaming up with the Illinois-based Timberline Knolls Treatment Center next year to launch what she says will be the first Web-based support group for pregnant women and moms with eating disorders. ""There are so many moms ... pregnant women, they're so ashamed, they don't want to tell anyone that they are doing what they are doing,"" said Baumann. But, she says, women should know that they are not alone and that they can be helped. ""You can recover from your eating disorder, and you can recover from being a mom or a pregnant woman with an eating disorder, and that shame,"" said Baumann. ""You can recover from that.""

"(EW.com) -- Ivan Reitman has decided that he will not return to direct the next installment of ""Ghostbusters,"" EW has confirmed. After producing and directing the previous two films and staying with the third project for years, Reitman will produce and help Sony find a new director for the film, which is eyeing an early 2015 shoot in New York. Deadline first reported the news. Reitman told Deadline that his decision to step down from the director's post was in part due to the death of Harold Ramis. He said: ""A lot of things happened in the last few months, the most significant of which was the passing of Harold, who was a very good friend who was extraordinarily influential in my career. We did five movies together including both Ghostbusters."" EW: 'Ghostbusters' co-star Dan Aykroyd, director Ivan Reitman on Harold Ramis' death .

"Istanbul (CNN) -- Turkey moved one step closer to prosecuting the senior commanders behind a military coup in 1980 when a Turkish court approved on Tuesday a prosecutor's indictment of retired army general and former president Kenan Evren, semi-official Anatolian Agency reported. Ankara's 12th Heavy Crime Court also announced retired air force chief Tahsin Sahinkaya was included in the indictment. According to Anatolian, the indictment suggests life imprisonment for Evren and Sahinkaya for allegedly committing ""acts against the forces of the state."" Some Turkish media have drawn parallels to the landmark prosecution of Chile's once unassailable military dictator Augusto Pinochet. Evren, now 94, led the overthrow of the Turkish government when he ordered tanks out into the streets of the capital in the pre-dawn hours of September 12, 1980. The overthrow brought an end to years of bloody killings between right- and left-wing Turkish militants, and many prominent voices in Turkey and abroad initially welcomed the coup. A Time magazine cover from the time even featured a ""paternalistic portrait of General Evren clasping a collage of the Istanbul skyline in his arms with the caption 'Holding Turkey Together',"" according to ""Turkey Unveiled, a History of Modern Turkey."" But in the aftermath of the military take-over, accounts of human rights abuses began to emerge. Hundreds of thousands of people were thrown in jail, many of them tortured. The military junta also disbanded political parties, jailed senior politicians, and sentenced hundreds of people to death. ""September 12th is the mother of all coups in Turkey's history,"" said Yasemin Congar, columnist and deputy editor of the Turkish daily newspaper ""Taraf."" ""It damaged the whole country and probably caused incurable damage on one whole generation of the youth in this society."" Hugh Pope, co-author of ""Turkey Unveiled,"" said the coup ""brought Turkish politics back to the kindergarten."" ""[Evren] somehow wanted to force the politicians to be less conflictual, but he did so by dumbing them down to the point that Turkey's political system is still recovering from it,"" he said. ""Unfortunately the consequences of his actions ruined so many people's lives. One has to wonder how Turkey is going to deal with that."" According to an article in the Turkish constitution, which was written by the military junta in 1982, Evren and his fellow officers were protected from prosecution. But recent constitutional changes drafted and ratified by prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's ruling Justice and Development Party cleared the way for a prosecutor to question Evren at his home last year. Erdogan's government has also overseen the arrest and trial of dozens of other army generals accused of a much more recent military coup plot, which was never successfully carried out. According to Anatolian Agency, authorities arrested retired general Hursit Tolon on Tuesday in connection to the more recent plot. And last week, authorities detained retired general Ilker Basbug, who commanded the Turkish armed forces until 2010. Some critics have called the prosecutions a witch hunt, targeting political opponents of Erdogan's government. Other argue it has been a vital process to bring the military under the control of elected civilian leaders. Since 1960, the once politically-dominant Turkish armed forces have overthrown four governments. ""Ending the belief of impunity is very, very important,"" said Congar of 'Taraf' newspaper, which has published many damning reports about the Turkish military in recent years. ""It's a huge step, obviously very late. These generals are very old. But it's still symbolically very important for this country.""","Turkish court approves indictments in 1980 military coup, Anatolian Agency reports .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Jurors in the Michael Jackson wrongful death trial have one less question to decide after the judge issued a partial directed verdict in favor of Jackson's mother Friday. Katherine Jackson has standing to seek damages against concert promoter AEG Live in the pop icon's death because evidence proved her son provided for ""everything,"" including her household expenses and food, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Yvette Palazuelos said in a ruling Friday afternoon. Lawyers for AEG Live unsuccessfully argued that Jackson's elderly mother could not sue because she was also supported by daughter Janet Jackson. Testimony ended Friday in the five-month-long trial, setting the stage for closing arguments to begin Tuesday. Judge Palazuelos will read her instructions to the jury on Monday. Jackson's mother and three children contend AEG Live is liable in his death because it negligently hired, retained or supervised Dr. Conrad Murray, who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in November 2011 and sentenced to four years in prison. Murray told police he infused Jackson with the surgical anesthetic propofol for 60 nights to treat his insomnia as he prepared for his comeback concerts. The coroner ruled his death on June 25, 2009, was from a propofol overdose. AEG Live lawyers have argued it was Jackson who chose and controlled Murray and that their executives had no way of knowing about the dangerous treatments the doctor was giving Jackson in the privacy of his bedroom. The judge cited testimony from Katherine Jackson and a financial expert hired by AEG Live in her partial directed verdict ruling. The defense expert concluded that the Michael Jackson paid for the ""bulk"" of his mother's support, including for her home, transportation, food and insurance, the ruling said. The only evidence AEG Live had supporting their defense was Katherine Jackson's testimony that her youngest daughter, Janet Jackson, gave her $10,000 a month for ""some period of years,"" the judge wrote. ""There is no evidence that Janet Jackson's contributions negated Katherine Jackson's reliance -- to some extent -- on [Michael Jackson's] contributions for the necessaries of life,"" Palazuelos ruled. California law does not allow parents to seek wrongful-death damages if their offspring had other heirs, unless they can prove they were financially dependent on their child. The judge is moving the trial to a much larger courtroom in the downtown Los Angeles courthouse, which will allow more than 300 people to watch closing arguments. The trial began in a courtroom that only seats 60 people.","Judge issues a partial directed verdict in favor of Katherine Jackson .

"(CNN) -- With all that's happening in the news, you might think moviegoers would skip over danger and depression in favor of something funny and light. You'd be wrong. ""Gone Girl,"" the dark drama about a disappearance that reveals a dysfunctional marriage, won fall's first big box office battle over the weekend, holding off a stronger-than-expected challenge from the horror prequel ""Annabelle."" Directed by David Fincher and starring Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike, ""Gone Girl"" features murder, infidelity, psychosis, deception and tabloid TV. (Before you start yelling ""spoilers!"" remember that most reviews of the film came out more than a week ago, and Gillian Flynn's best-selling novel has been on shelves for two years.) Earning $38 million, ""Gone Girl"" is director Fincher's biggest debut ever, easily surpassing the $30 million ""Panic Room"" opened with in 2002. Though most horror films have suffered at the box office this year, new release ""Annabelle"" bucked the trend. With an opening weekend bow of $37.2 million, the movie quintupled its $6.5 million budget and nearly knocked the higher-profile ""Gone Girl"" out of top spot. The fright flick is a prequel to last year's ""The Conjuring,"" so that connection may have helped -- and if there's a month when horror movies figure to score, it's October. The weekend's other major release, ""Left Behind,"" was even darker in tone, depicting a world literally gone to hell after the Rapture. Nicolas Cage assumes the Kirk Cameron role in the latest big-screen take on the postapocalyptic Christian novels. Critics savaged the thriller, but enough moviegoers turned out to give it a decent debut of $6.9 million, finishing just outside the top five. There was some laughter, light and heroism to be found at theaters as ""The Boxtrolls,"" ""Dolphin Tale 2"" and the Energizer bunny of 2014 movies, ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" held strongest at the box office. Marvel's ""Guardians"" spent its 10th straight weekend in the top 10, increasing its total domestic box office take to $323 million. If twisted relationships, possessed dolls and the end of the world aren't your cup of cinematic tea, it's reassuring to know a talking tree named Groot will still be around for a while. Domestic weekend box office estimates from Exhibitor Relations Co. (final numbers available Monday afternoon): . 1. ""Gone Girl,"" $38 million . 2. ""Annabelle,"" $37.2 million . 3. ""The Equalizer,"" $19 million . 4. ""The Boxtrolls,"" $12.4 million . 5. ""The Maze Runner,"" $12 million .","The dark drama ""Gone Girl"" opened at No. 1 .

"(CNN) -- Beijing hosted one of the most memorable Summer Olympics in recent history -- now the Chinese capital is hoping to welcome the world's top Winter Games stars for the first time in a joint 2022 bid. The 2008 host, along with the northern city of Zhangjiakou, is vying with several European cities after having officially entered the bidding, according to the Chinese Olympic Committee (COC). Beijing would stage the ice events, reports the country's state-run news agency Xinhua, while snow-based competitions would take place in Zhangjiakou. ""The 2008 Olympics has left many legacies to Beijing, which includes experience and sufficient infrastructure,"" Beijing Sports Bureau chief Li Yingchuan told Xinhua. ""Take the Capital Stadium as an example, it has about 10,000 seats."" Beijing hosted an International Skating Union competition earlier this month but would still require a new speed skating arena. There are plans to build an express railway line to cover the 174 km distance from Beijing to Zhangjiakou, which is in Hebei Province. It is estimated the journey time will be just 40 minutes, but Li is wary of the cost to the local environment. ""The government has already started to tackle the problem,"" said Li. ""I believe in 10 years the situation will be much better."" China faces a fight to win the hosting rights, with Germany's Munich, the Norwegian capital Oslo, Almaty in Kazahkstan, Poland's Krakow, Ukraine's Lviv and Sweden's Oestersund all in the mix. There is also the fact that Pyeongchang of South Korea will host the 2018 Winter Games -- making it unlikely that another Asian country would succeed in 2022. ""There is a rotation rule, though unwritten, in the bid. Since Pyeongchang won the 2018 bid, Beijing as another Asian city will face a daunting task to beat the odds,"" Li said. ""I would say anything is possible. Even if Beijing loses this time, we will continue our efforts in the future."" A decision on which country will host the 2022 Games will be made in July 2015 by the International Olympic Committee. Japan is the only Asian country to have hosted the Winter Olympics, in Sapporo (1972) and Nagano (1998).","China makes bid to host Winter Olympic Games in 2022 .

"(CNN) -- Conventional thinking is that every race in every campaign cycle comes with a debate between the candidates. An increasingly informed, technoliterate electorate threatens to make debates an endangered species, however. In a few cases, at least, that's for the best. If only all debates were presidential debates, with serious candidates discussing critical issues in front of the world's news media. Presidential level debates set a high bar to test prospective leaders of the free world. On the state and congressional levels, debates regularly offer less nourishing fare. In less headline-grabbing state and federal contests, political debates have often become empty theater, scripted to be meaningless and do everything but inform voters. In some campaigns, debates can even distort the real picture by lending credibility to candidates who don't merit it -- candidates who by their own mistakes have no chance at success. This year, there is no better example than Ohio, where incumbent Republican Gov. John R. Kasich is leading his Democrat challenger, Cuyahoga County Executive Ed FitzGerald, by a healthy margin -- after FitzGerald spectacularly imploded, effectively destroying himself, his campaign staff and all political life in his vicinity. Though we once expected to see a hotly contested governor's race in Ohio, Kasich's solid, first-term economic performance scared off better challengers and left the Democrats with the less-than-top-tier option of FitzGerald. Just how ""less"" became evident when news surfaced that police found him in his car in a parking lot at 4:30 a.m. with a woman who wasn't Mrs. FitzGerald. Just when you thought it couldn't get worse for FitzGerald, Ohio then learned that he had gone 10 years without a driver's license, including while he was a public official, using official cars and overseeing the firing of employees who didn't meet requirements of having a driver's license. No wonder late-night talk show hosts love the endless fount of material known as politics. It's no surprise that Democrats have abandoned FitzGerald. He's shifted much of his funds to support other races by Democratic candidates and the media has ratcheted down coverage of the Ohio governor's race. In this environment, a flailing candidate has nothing to lose by going into a debate only to serve himself, not voters, and cause trouble. Ed FitzGerald will not be the next governor of Ohio, so voters won't appreciably benefit from being informed on his positions, whether policy or personal. In fact, having mismanaged his campaign so badly, his only goal would be to toss a few bombs to win favor with Democratic Party bosses in hope they might mercifully bestow a patronage job on him after November. I would not argue for a campaign in which an incumbent is subject to less scrutiny or fewer probing questions from the news media. If Hillary Clinton runs for president and her only opponent is Sen. Bernie Sanders, there's a good argument for her to agree to debates. However, let's get real: It is no great public service to allow a doomed and desperate candidate to turn a serious debate into a food fight. There is a difference between urging a candidate to face appropriate public scrutiny and asking him to become a dartboard. In an environment charged with desperation, a debate sometimes does nothing to enlighten or inform voters. As someone who has spent a good 40 years directing political campaigns, I'd urge Kasich not to debate and, instead, stand before the voters and press directly. The likelihood of personal attacks and water-muddying is so assured that it would be better -- for Kasich, voters, the dignity of the process and the dignity of the position -- to cut out the debate theatrics and help voters better understand what their governor plans for his second term by standing before them in open forums such as town halls. Instead of watching a debate, I'd urge voters to spend an evening on the Internet, reading news stories and digesting analyses by independent groups. There's a lot voters should still learn. Skipping debates when they move from real discussions to farce is not uncommon. Former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi -- hardly a shrinking violet -- has refused debates, as has former New York Gov. George Pataki, also not one to shy away from a fight. Former Tennessee Gov. Don Sundquist did it too, taking a pass on sharing a stage with a perennial gadfly universally regarded as a less than serious candidate. They were all, of course, criticized for their decisions but were none the worse for wear, in part because they were known quantities, whose performance and policies had stood the test of time and had already been scrutinized and evaluated by voters. Alternative methods for delivering information were available to voters then and democracy survived. How much more is that true today? Conventional political debates are but one potential victim of the disruptive nature of technology. The depth of information available at our fingertips today, from our laptops and mobile devices, is astounding. Can debates play an ongoing role -- perhaps even enhanced by technology? Of course they can. CNN has been a leader in modernizing debates, turning them into two-way communications events, connecting voters not only with candidates but also with each other. Now it's nearly impossible to watch a presidential debate without tweeting about it with our friends. The days of relying on only a few static pillars of voter education -- debates and newspaper endorsements, for example -- are over. Old institutions that monopolized information are being forced to compete and adapt or face replacement. Amidst today's information deluge, voters are increasingly able to find the information that best serves them, and we're all the better for it. Candidates who embrace this type of change are no less accountable or responsive to the scrutiny inherent in elections. In fact, they are more so and stand to be better rewarded by voters who seek leaders to guide them to a better world.

"(CNN) -- Sunday night marked the first time we've heard from Lindsay Lohan since her most recent stint in rehab, in her eagerly awaited pow wow with Oprah Winfrey. In the course of an hour, there was some ""pow"" and a bit of ""wow"" for those of us used to seeing the young actress as a troubled starlet. Lohan appeared coherent and comfortable answering questions on ""Oprah's Next Chapter,"" where she started out being clear that she wanted to share her truth. Filmed four days after Lohan left her sixth rehab, the interview kicked off Winfrey's OWN network's Lohan programming, which will also include a reality docu-series about Lohan's attempt to get her life back on track. Looking healthier than fans have seen her in a while, Lohan wore a tangerine-colored form-fitting dress, her hair pulled back in a ponytail and light make-up. She referred to herself as an ""addict"" almost immediately and discussed everything from her drug of choice to her relationship with her parents. Since 7 is a lucky number and so many are wishing her the best, here are the 7 things we learned from the show: . 1) Lohan secretly wished to go to jail that first time . Oprah reminds us that on July 6, 2010, Lohan violated her probation after missing her alcohol counseling sessions. She was sentenced to 90 days in jail, but only served two weeks because of jail overcrowding. The actress said that being an addict and surrounded by so much chaos made her ""kind of want"" to go to jail. ""I think it was just to have some peace and just have no choice but to just sit and be,"" Lohan told Winfrey. ""I'll never forget that moment (of being sentenced)."" 2) Alcohol is her drug of choice, not cocaine . According to Lohan, booze is way more of a problem for her than cocaine, despite the many jokes bandied about to the contrary. Lohan told Winfrey she has only done cocaine ""10 to 15 times"" and never really enjoyed snorting it. The attraction of the drug, she said, was that it allowed her to drink more. ""(Cocaine) was like a party thing. People would have it and I would do it,"" she said. ""It went hand in hand with drinking."" Lohan also revealed that she's no longer on Adderall, and did not use the stimulant to control her weight. But, she said, ""It did ground me."" These days, Lohan said the only pills she takes are vitamins and Nexium, for acid reflux. 3) She admits that she's been a mess . Lohan said she hates being known - as Winfrey put it - ""as an adjective and verb for bad behavior and child star gone wrong."" It's not at all what Lohan said she aspired to be. She says her reputation for being late on set, among other famous complaints, came from her being ""so distracted in the past that I wasn't on point with that."" But she believes she can turn it around. ""As long as I stay honest with myself and just do the work that I am willing to do, and have been willing to do and am doing, there's nothing that can stand in the way of that,"" Lohan said. ""I'm my own worst enemy and I know that."" 4) Her troubles started with ""Mean Girls"" After the success of multiple films, including ""The Parent Trap"" and ""Herbie: Fully Loaded,"" Lohan was making $7 million a picture. She said it was after she hit it even bigger in 2004's ""Mean Girls"" that she decided to move to Los Angeles. That spelled trouble for the then-18-year-old, as she said she was reckless with her money and vulnerable to the hangers-on who surrounded her. In response to Winfrey's query as who was there to guide her then, the actress shrugged and said ""No one really, when I think about it."" 5) Lohan is very spiritual . ""I feel whole again,"" Lohan told Winfrey of how she's feeling post this last trip to rehab. ""I'm a very spiritual person and I've become more spiritual as time has gone on,"" Lohan said. ""I'm really in touch, whether it's prayer or meditation... there are so many powers greater than me in the world. I've been blessed and lucky enough to have been given a gift to share with other people."" 6) She doesn't blame her parents . Lohan maintained that she loves her parents and is close with them both, despite the time her father secretly taped a phone call during which Lindsay accused her mother of drug use. Michael Lohan made the tape public and it quickly went viral. Lohan said she lied to her father during that conversation. It was after a fight with her mother and Lohan said she was ""acting out."" She said she was unsure as to why her father ""betrayed"" her, but said her parents now get along. ""I hate the bad rap that people give my parents,"" Lohan said. ""Because they are just parents, really, at the end of the day trying to stand up for their daughter and themselves."" Her parents are not responsible for her poor choices, she said. Still, she has since asked her parents to keep their lives private. 7) ""I am different"" Lohan said she understands that she's perceived as someone who has been given chance after chance, but she expressed what seemed to be a sincere desire to return to work, or as Lohan calls acting, ""the thing that has made me happiest my whole life."" She told Oprah that she is ready to ""work really hard and stay focused and prove myself in the way that I did before in the past and I lost. I have to regain the trust of people in my career that have their doubts and I fully respect that on their behaf."" When Oprah asked about Lohan's upcoming trip to Europe and whether that would be a good idea so soon after rehab, Lohan thought she could handle it. ""I feel different. I'm in a different headspace. I don't want those things that I wanted before,"" she said. Days after the interview taped, Lohan canceled her trip. ""It's a process of growing up and recognizing and being just so tired and exhausted by the chaos, which is what it really is,"" Lohan said in the interview. ""I have had no right in my past to complain about being followed by cameras and people making up stories, but there's something to be said about me moving forward.""","Lohan calls herself an addict in an interview with Oprah Winfrey .

"(CNN) -- Spain have drawn level with Brazil's record by going 35 matches unbeaten, after second-half goals from David Villa and Fernando Llorente gave them a 2-0 Confederations Cup victory over host nation South Africa in Bloemfontein. The South African players appeal for handball as David Villa celebrates Spain's opening goal on Saturday. The result ensures the European champions comfortably reach the semifinals of the competition as group winners, while South Africa also progress to the last four after New Zealand and Iraq draw 0-0 in Saturday's other Group A match in Johannesburg. Vicente Del Bosque's side were last beaten in November 2006 and they will better Brazil's unbeaten streak, achieved between 1993 and 1996, if they win Wednesday's semifinal. Spain have also drawn level with Australia, Brazil and France in winning 15 consecutive matches and victory on Wednesday will ensure they break that record as well. After a goalless first half, the match exploded into life five minutes after the interval when Spain's Cesc Fabregas was crudely fouled in the area by Aaron Mokoena, who has just signed a contract with Portsmouth and has regularly faced the Arsenal midfielder in the English Premier League. In-demand Valencia striker David Villa stepped up to take it, but his spot-kick was superbly pushed away by goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune, diving to his right. However, South African joy was short-lived as just a minute late Villa again showed what a class player he is when turning superbly to fire home Albert Riera's inch-perfect through-ball. The South African players claimed Villa controlled the ball with his arm before burying it into the far corner and TV replays seemed to indicate they had a valid argument for the goal to be disallowed. Villa's strike was his 31st goal in 47 international appearances, putting him just 13 off Raul Gonzalez's all-time Spanish record. Spain, who look a class apart in this tournament and have qualified after winning all their three games without conceding a goal, secured the three points in the 71st minute when substitute Fernando Llorente turned the ball home in a crowded goalmouth, after Xavi's low free-kick from the right had been helped on by a Fabregas mis-kick. Despite the defeat, South Africa's participation in the tournament remains very much alive after Iraq and New Zealand played out a dull stalemate. A two-goal Iraq victory would have seen the host nation crash out, but the result was no great surprise as neither side managed to score a single goal in their three matches. Sunday sees the remaining Group B matches played, with Italy and Mexico battling it out to seemingly join Brazil in the last four.

"(CNN) -- Family members of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 passengers and crew heard the news they feared most Monday: ""All lives are lost."" For many, who have waited and hoped for more than two weeks for signs of life from their loved ones, the grief was too much to bear. ""They have told us all lives are lost,"" a relative told a CNN producer at Beijing's Lido Hotel, where family members were called to meet with airline representatives. Just before the relatives were briefed in a conference room, four emergency medical workers entered, dressed in bright orange uniforms. A bed on wheels also was pushed inside. After some time, family members emerged, sobbing loudly. A few pushed and shoved one another. Some people were wheeled out on the bed. One group smashed a photojournalist's camera lens. A relative rushed out of the room, screaming, ""You announce this information today. ... Is it really confirmed? What's your proof? We've been waiting for 17 days. You simply tell us this! Where is the proof? It's wrong to announce the information like this!"" A Chinese grandmother staggered out of the conference room, screaming, ""The Communist Party has to help me! My son, my daughter-in-law and granddaughter were all on board! All three family members are gone. I am desperate!"" She sobbed and fell to her knees. Malaysia Airlines told CNN it sent a text message to family members before briefing those in person in Beijing and Kuala Lumpur and speaking to others by phone. It texted this to relatives of passengers: ""Malaysia Airlines deeply regrets that we have to assume beyond a reasonable doubt that MH370 has been lost and that none of those on board survived. As you will hear in the next hour from Malaysia's Prime Minister, we must now accept all evidence suggests the plane went down in the Southern Indian Ocean."" At a news conference in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak told reporters that Flight 370 went down somewhere in the southern Indian Ocean, far from any possible landing site. The airline is working on an arrangement to fly families to Australia once wreckage is found. 'Anguished relatives' CNN's Sara Sidner, who has been in Kuala Lumpur over the past few days, has spent time with family members. ""These families have been through absolute hell,"" she reported on air shortly before the Prime Minister's news conference began. Family members have tended to move in groups, Sidner said, clinging to one another for support. Counselors are with them. Upon hearing the latest news, Sidner said, some relatives said they felt they had answers. But since their nightmare began, many family members have ""felt they'd been left out,"" she said. Since they learned the plane was missing, they have wept and begged authorities for answers, and some have appeared enraged by the seeming lack of progress. ""We're all human, and we all hurt. We all struggle through things. So I'm not the first one to go through something like this, and I'm certainly not going to be the last one,"" the brother of American passenger Philip Wood told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360."" ""I don't like being trite when I say my faith is getting me through this. It sounds kind of cliche to say it. It's a hope that we have that this is not the end of all things,"" James Wood said. Philip Wood's girlfriend has been writing her boyfriend on her personal Facebook page, notes that are tender and anguished. Sarah Bajc has written to Wood that she misses him and wishes he would hurry up and come back to her. A Facebook page called Finding Philip Wood has become a repository for kind notes to Bajc and messages from others who have followed the flight mystery. After the news conference Monday, a message was posted on the site, though it's unclear who composed it: ""Our collective hearts are hurting now. Please lift all the loved ones of MH370 with your good thoughts and prayers. Thank you for your continued support and for being our inspiration."" Bajc wrote in an e-mail to reporters after Monday's development that she still has no closure because there's still ""no confirmed wreckage."" She wrote: ""I need closure to be certain but cannot keep on with the public efforts against all odds. I STILL feel his presence, so perhaps it was his soul all along. ... It looks like the first phase of our mission has ended. Now Philip's family and I will need some time for private grief."" Bimal Sharma's sister was also aboard the flight, and like Bajc, he stressed that no debris has been found. He told CNN's ""The Lead With Jake Tapper"" that he wants to ""see something from the seas."" ""Only thing I hope -- they don't give up the search,"" he said. ""There are too many unanswered questions from this flight: Why was it diverted? Why did it fly low?"" Criticism of investigation . Hours after Razak's news conference Monday, a committee representing some of families of the 154 Chinese and Taiwanese passengers aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 criticized the Malaysian government in a statement, accusing authorities of deliberate search delays and cover-ups, China's state-run CCTV reported. ""If our 154 relatives aboard lost their lives due to such reasons, then Malaysia Airlines, the Malaysian government and the Malaysian military are the real murderers that killed them,"" the statement said. Many have been critical of Malaysian authorities and Malaysia Airlines regarding the investigation. The airline has defended its actions, explaining that it takes time to verify satellite signals and analyze those signals' significance before releasing information. Last week, three women who are relatives of the passengers staged a protest at the Kuala Lumpur hotel where the media were staying. Their efforts were cut short by security guards who removed them through a crush of reporters, dragging one as she screamed. One woman cried: ""My son ... I just want my son back."" She and the other family members said they weren't satisfied with ""the Malaysian government's inaction."" ""What we need is to know the truth, to know where the plane is,"" she shouted. ""We have had enough. Malaysian government are liars."" Another woman shouted, ""I don't care what your government does. I just want my son back!"" CNN's Yuli Yang, Pauline Chiou and Mariano Castillo contributed to this report.","""All three family members are gone. I am desperate!"" shouts a Chinese grandmother .

"(CNN) -- There's no escaping the fact that the Human Brain Project, with its billion-dollar plan to recreate the human mind inside a supercomputer, sounds like a science fiction nightmare. But those involved hope their ambitious goal of simulating the tangle of neurons and synapses that power our thought processes could offer solutions to tackling conditions such as depression, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's. The Human Brain venture is the next step in a long-running program that has already succeeded in using computers to create a virtual replica of part of a rat's neocortex -- a section of the brain believed to control higher functions such as conscious thought, movement and reasoning. Scientists at its forerunner, the Switzerland-based Blue Brain Project, have been working since 2005 to feed a computer with vast quantities of data and algorithms produced from studying tiny slivers of rodent gray matter. Last month they announced a significant advancement when they were able to use their simulator to accurately predict the location of synapses in the neocortex, effectively mapping out the complex electrical brain circuitry through which thoughts travel. Henry Markram, the South African-born neuroscientist who heads the project, said the breakthrough would have taken ""decades, if not centuries"" to chart using a real neocortex. He said it was proof their concept, dubbed ""brain in a box"" by Nature magazine, would work. Read: Mapping out a new era in brain research . Now the team are joining forces with other scientists to create the Human Brain Project. As its name suggests, they aim to scale up their model to recreate an entire human brain. It is a step that will need both a huge increase in funding and access to computers so advanced that they have yet to be built. If their current bid for â‚¬1 billion ($1.3 billion) of European Commission funding over the next 10 years is successful, Markram predicts that his computer neuroscientists are a decade away from producing a synthetic mind that could, in theory, talk and interact in the same way humans do. His bold claims have inevitably fueled comparisons to doom-laden popular fiction in which conscious machines turn on their creators and wreak havoc. The project's scientists have been referred to as ""team Frankenstein"" and their computer likened to ""Skynet,"" the virtual intelligence that unleashes a robot war on humanity in the ""Terminator"" films. Sean Hill, a senior computational neuroscientist on the project, laughs at such comparisons. He says the computer will primarily become a repository for knowledge about the brain that will allow scientists to conduct experiments without the need to probe inside people's skulls. Read: $1 billion mission to reach the Earth's mantle . ""This is a tool for research, not a giant simulated brain that is going to rule the world,"" he said. ""Right now, we're in a crisis in neuroscience. There's a lot of wonderful data being gathered but we don't have a place where we can put those experimental results together and understand their implications. ""The benefit of having this facility is you have a place to integrate the data into a model where you can test predictions and start to learn principles of how the brain operates."" The computing power needed to build the model is phenomenal. Simply to replicate one of the 10,000 neuron brain cells involved in the rat experiment took the processing capacity usually found in a single laptop. To simulate a fully functioning human brain, it would take billions. Hill says that such computational power -- known as exascale -- will be available by the end of the decade. The Human Brain Project's scientists are hoping to work with supercomputer developers to ensure future machines match their requirements. But, even as the team touts its experiments as a possible solution to the brain diseases that affect about two billion people worldwide, they have attracted critics who say their work is far too broad in scope to achieve usable results. Professor Terry Sejnowski, head of the Computational Neurobiology Laboratory at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in San Diego, has been quoted as saying the Blue Brain project is ""bound to fail."" Read: How the search for aliens can help sustain life on Earth . He told CNN via email that ""progress is being made but there is still a long way to go before we will understand the computational capabilities of cortical circuits."" He added: ""We are just beginning to appreciate how complex our brains are, far beyond any other device in the known universe."" Sean Hill said the team hoped it was answering skeptics with its achievements so far. ""It's just a matter of keeping on doing it. Let's keep improving these tools and open them up so that many scientists are engaged and collaborating and using it as common point to bring the data together,"" he said. ""The only way to address the critics is to keep working, showing the positive results and do the best we can -- and that is starting to happen.""","Human Brain Project will use supercomputers to mimic tangle of neurons and synapses that power our thoughts .
Scientists say the simulator could offer new insight into the treatment of brain disease like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Lindsay Lohan, accused of stealing a necklace, spent five hours in custody before posting a $75,000 bond Friday evening after a judge sentenced her to 120 days in jail for violating her drunk driving probation. Her release from Los Angeles County's Lynwood Correctional Facility capped a long day that included a victory for the actress when a judge reduced the felony grand theft charge to a misdemeanor. Lohan will remain free on bond while her lawyer appeals the jail sentence for the probation violation, but she must immediately start serving 480 hours of community service, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Stephanie Sautner said. The community service, includes 360 hours at a downtown Los Angeles women's center, which Judge Sautner suggested might cause Lohan to behave better after seeing ""how truly needy women and women who have fallen on real hard times have to live."" She must complete another 120 hours of community service at the Los Angeles County morgue. The judge ruled Friday that the necklace theft case against Lohan will go forward to trial, but the felony charge was reduced to a misdemeanor. ""I'm going to give her an opportunity,"" Sautner said. Sautner did not buy the defense argument that Lohan accidentally walked out of a Venice, California, jewelry store wearing a necklace that later appeared around her neck in photographs taken five days later. ""If in fact it was an accident, she could have called the store back,"" Sautner said. People.com: Judge scolds Lohan . Defense attorney Shawn Holley argued that Lohan was busy and scattered when she was at the store and absent-mindedly walked out with the necklace. ""It's undisputed that Ms. Lohan walked out of the store with the necklace on,"" Holley said. The prosecution must show she had ""specific intent to permanently deprive the store of that necklace."" While Holley conceded that Lohan ""did not rush to return the necklace,"" but it just ""makes her not a very considerate or courteous person."" ""The fact that she may not have been a courteous or considerate person doesn't make her a thief,"" Holley said. ""I see the intent here and the level of brazenness to say 'Let me see what I can get away with here,' "" Sautner said. A police detective testified that Lohan's assistant handed the necklace to a police officer after learning through a website posting that police had obtained a search warrant hours earlier to search for it in her home. Prosecutor Danette Meyers argued that ""it doesn't take a rocket scientist"" to realize Lohan returned the necklace to police because she knew her home was about to be searched. Lohan's trial date was set for June 3, but she must return to court for a hearing May 11, the judge said. A misdemeanor could still result in up to a year in prison for Lohan. Before delivering the good news to Lohan about the reduction of the charge, the judge addressed her much-publicized misbehavior. ""She thumbs her nose at the court,"" Sautner said, referring to an incident with another judge last year. ""She walks into court with 'F U' on her fingernails. I don't know what that means unless it has 'I am' before it."" The jeweler who accused Lohan of stealing the gold and diamond necklace testified Friday that she had not gotten any money from selling the security camera video of the actress in her store. Kamofie and Company owner Sofia Kamen was the second witness called by the prosecution in the preliminary hearing. Holley used the the store's licensing of the video, for a reported $40,000, to question Kamen's motives in accusing Lohan of theft. All of the money from the video licensing went to publicist Christopher Spencer, who Kamen said she fired last month because he was negotiating deals for the store that she was not interested in, she testified. Kamen said that she realized the necklace was missing 10 minutes after the actress left the store last January. She wasn't closely watching Lohan, even though there was another incident four days earlier in which the actress almost walked out wearing a diamond earring. ""We thought it was an accident,"" Kamen said. ""We weren't thinking that she would take it."" The first prosecution witness was Tinelli Comsooksri, a store employee who was working the day of the earring incident. ""She was covering the earring that she still left on with her hair,"" Comsooksri said. She stopped Lohan as she was walking out, Comsooksri said. As prosecutor Meyers held the infamous necklace, now known as ""People's Exhibit 2,"" Kamen testified that it was priced at $2,500 although it cost the store only $850. She explained that retail jewelers routinely triple the wholesale price. The value of the necklace was a crucial issue for Lohan for the felony grand theft charge to be reduced to a misdemeanor. Shoplifting offenses are charged as petty theft if the property taken is valued at less than $950. Lohan has been in court nine times in the past year, mostly for hearings related to probation violations for her 2007 drunk driving case. She did a short stint in jail last year, but she also checked into substance abuse rehab twice under court order.","NEW: Lohan leaves jail after 5 hours in custody Friday evening .

"(CNN) -- Formula One's new rule banning driver coaching on team radios is now in place, but it was a message going in the other direction that summed up the fine line between success and failure for this season's title contenders. ""Dammit!"" uttered a frustrated Nico Rosberg after being gazumped by Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton at the end of qualifying for Sunday's Singapore Grand Prix. The German was pipped by just seven-thousandths of a second under lights at the Marina Bay street circuit on Saturday, giving his British rival the chance to further chip into his 22-point lead. Hamilton won the last race at Monza after starting on pole, battling back to beat Rosberg after losing his early advantage, and a seventh victory this season would give him the momentum as the campaign moves towards its climax. ""Seven-thousandths! When I think back at the lap, it's nothing,"" Rosberg, seeking his first world title, told reporters when asked to explain his radio outburst. ""But that's the way it is. Lewis did a good job to get pole. Second is okay, first would be better, but there's a long race ahead so it's fine."" Hamilton has not won in Singapore since the year after his sole world title success in 2008. ""To have the last lap at the end like that is always the plan, although it doesn't always go to plan like it did,"" said the Englishman, who like Rosberg had moved past late pacesetter Daniel Ricciardo at the end of the third and final session. ""On the last lap I locked up in turn one, lost some time, although I made it back in other areas, I kept going. It was an exciting qualifying session. I wasn't expecting to see so many people up there fighting."" Ricciardo was 0.73 seconds behind Rosberg and 0.48s ahead of fourth-placed Red Bull teammate Sebastian Vettel -- who has won the Singapore race for the past three years. ""We came into the weekend thinking if we were within two to three-tenths of a second that would give us a chance to stay with them,"" said Australian Ricciardo, who is the only other driver outside the Mercedes duo to have won a race this year. ""So to end up being closer than we thought, it's been a good day. It was good fun. Hopefully I can keep it up tomorrow and get a better view from the podium."" Four-time world champion Vettel was 0.005s ahead of Fernando Alonso, who was 0.093s in front of his former Ferrari teammate Felipe Massa, now at Williams. Alonso's current teammate Kimi Raikkonen was back in seventh. The Finn was fastest in Q1 but was unable to set a final lap in Q3 due to a power problem. Massa's teammate Valtteri Bottas was eighth ahead of rookies Kevin Magnussen of McLaren and Daniil Kvyat of Toro Rosso. Magnussen's teammate Jenson Button failed to make Q3, and the 2009 world champion -- twice a runner-up in Singapore -- will start in 11th place. Button had said Friday that he hoped the rule banning radio coaching would give experienced drivers an advantage. ""It is probably not such good news for Mercedes, who coach their drivers, but I have never been coached around a lap anyway -- where to go quick and where to go slow,"" said the 34-year-old. ""Now we are masters of our own fate."" Both Hamilton and Rosberg have ignored team instructions this season as they have fought a bitter battle for the title, but these arguments have related more to race strategy as opposed to specific coaching of how to negotiate circuits. ""When the driver is on the track he should be driving the car himself,"" Formula One race director Charlie Whiting told reporters Friday. ""Whether he receives coaching outside an event, he's perfectly at liberty to do that of course. But once he's out on that track, he should be doing it himself. That's the reason for the rule and that's the reason why we believe we have to enforce it. ""If a team informs a driver to change his brake balance, that's absolutely fine, provided it's not for a specific part of the circuit. So, in other words, one click forward for Turn 5 and two clicks backward for Turn 10, those are the sort of things we consider to be driver coaching, assisting the driver. ""A global change to the brake balance, or any other similar parameter on the car, would be for overall performance, which is fine.""

"(CNN) -- You may not have noticed it, but in the midst of all the usual finger-pointing and polarization, a bit of actual problem-solving is underway in American politics. A coalition of unlikely allies has coalesced in recent months to advance criminal justice reform. These strange bedfellows -- from liberal Democrats such as Sen. Dick Durbin to tea party darlings such as Sen. Mike Lee, from the NAACP to Americans for Tax Reform -- are all proposing reductions in mandatory minimum sentences. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder's calls for such reductions have been cheered by some of the same Republicans who otherwise want to impeach him. In Texas, a conservative group called Right on Crime has led the way on prison and sentencing reform -- earning plaudits from, among others, California progressives. Why this rash of consensus? Well, for the right, it's mainly about getting control of big government -- prisons now consume a quarter of the Justice Department's budget, and state prison spending has been on a multidecade boom with little corresponding ""return on investment."" For the left, it's mainly about social justice -- the disparity in criminal sentencing for crack versus powder cocaine has a long-documented racial dimension, and blindly filling the ""school-to-prison pipeline"" has seemed misguided and cruel. Democrats and Republicans agree the metastasis of the prison-industrial complex is unhealthy. But for each side there are also benefits to acknowledging the other side's rationale. In a GOP sometimes perceived as intolerant, Rand Paul's embrace of sentencing reform lets him to show his concern for minorities. Civil rights Democrats, meanwhile, get to embrace fiscal responsibility. The criminal justice deal-making suggests a possible way forward for our politics: crosspartisanship. Crosspartisanship may look like bipartisanship, but it's different. Bipartisan compromise typically splits the difference between the views of two parties, giving each side less than its ideal outcome. A crosspartisan approach, by contrast, finds issues where people from both parties converge on a common principle, even if for different reasons, and achieve an outcome that's ideal to both. Where else might such crosspartisanship take hold? Curbing government surveillance is a possibility. Reducing crony capitalism is another. Even reform of the federal tax code, an arena as full of political landmines as crime and punishment used to be, might be feasible. On surveillance, Edward Snowden's revelations have scrambled party affiliations, bringing civil libertarians from left and right together to push back against the National Security Agency. Liberals hate the size of the national security state because they are wary of war; conservatives hate it because they are wary of government. On crony capitalism, Republicans since 2008 have blamed the housing and financial collapse on the profligate policies of quasigovernmental agencies such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, while Democrats have blamed unregulated and predatory Wall Street firms. It's possible, of course, that they're both substantially right. The moment is ripe for a liberal to say that government created the conditions for corruption in housing finance, and for a conservative to say that the absence of government accelerated such corruption. Perhaps both sides can agree that when public policy allows businesses to privatize gain while socializing loss, that's neither true capitalism nor good government. On taxes, GOP House member Dave Camp of Michigan recently put forward a framework for tax reform that, while admittedly going nowhere legislatively, did take aim at tax expenditures -- loopholes -- that disproportionately benefit the privileged. He's not alone among conservatives, and they may be able to join with liberals who see such tax expenditures as welfare for the rich. I'm not suggesting by any means that we're about to enter some golden age of collaboration in our politics. On plenty of issues -- making it easier for unions to organize workers or cutting taxes on the rich -- there are still irreconcilable policy differences that reflect deeper differences in worldview. Some people, like me, think unions are generally a force for good; others see them as inherently inefficient, even evil. Some people divide the country into ""makers"" and ""takers""; others find that division and its implications repugnant. So the fighting will in most cases continue. But in the same way that the United States in foreign policy can sometimes partner with adversaries or rivals -- simply because it is in our interest in that moment to do so -- perhaps in domestic politics we can foster more such pragmatism. And make it contagious. If that's going to happen, though, it'll be up to us as citizens to say that we want it. We'll have to reward elected leaders for this style of crosspartisan problem-solving. We'll have to resist punishing them for even talking to ""the enemy."" And then more leaders will have to learn to think -- and lead -- outside the lines of party. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Eric Liu.","Eric Liu: Both parties have come together to advance criminal justice reform .
Liu: Their deal-making suggests a way forward for politics: crosspartisanship .
He says partnering with rivals sometimes is pragmatic and works in our interests .

"(CNN) -- Former Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has launched a staunch defense of John Terry declaring: ""He is not a racist."" Chelsea captain Terry was handed a four-match ban and a $356,000 fine by the English Football Association on Thursday after being found guilty of racially abusing Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand. Terry, who captained Mourinho's Chelsea to consecutive Premier League titles in 2005 and 2006, remains close friends with the Portuguese manager, who is now Real Madrid's coach, following their successful time at Stamford Bridge. Terry retires from England amid racism case . ""He is not a racist,"" Mourinho told CNN in an exclusive interview. ""That's 100%. Chelsea had a squad where we had 12 African players in the squad. It was a fantastic squad and he had always a great relation with every one of them."" While defending Terry, Mourinho insisted the FA had been right to punish Terry. ""But in football it can happen, and I know it can happen, that during a football match -- because sometimes it's more than a game -- sometimes you have reactions that don't represent what you are really. ""Probably, he had a racist comment or a ""racist"" attitude against an opponent and, sometimes in football, we look to our opponents in the wrong way. But to pay, he has to be punished. Racism remains ""significant"" problem in English football . ""But please, don't say that he is a racist, because I know what I am saying. Didier Drogba will say, Geremi will say, Claude Makelele will say, all of them will say that he is not a racist."" The incident involving Terry is the second high-profile case of racist abuse on the football field following the incident between Liverpool's Luis Suarez and Manchester United's Patrice Evra last year. The Liverpool striker was banned for eight matches and fined $65,000 after being found guilty of misconduct, regarding ""using insulting words towards"" Evra during the game at Anfield on October 15 2011. And asked whether he though there is still racism in football, Mourinho replied: ""I never felt it. Never. In a dressing room, I have never felt it and I've always had African players in every one of my teams."" Terry's punishment comes just days after he announced his retirement from international football, claiming that the FA had made his position within the national team 'untenable'. In July the 31-year-old defender had been found not guilty of a racially aggravated public order offence at Westminster Magistrates' Court. However the FA requires a lower burden of proof than an English court and it took the decision to bring Terry before its disciplinary system.

"(CNN) -- Until this week, how many parents paid much attention to ""Slenderman""? He was a fictional villain in a wildly popular online game of hide and seek -- a tall, thin, and faceless monster with tentacle-like arms featured in Web-based ghost stories created by and for horror story enthusiasts. But that's where this story takes a very dark and tragic turn. With the arrest last weekend of two 12-year-old girls in a suburb of Milwaukee for the alleged stabbing and attempted murder of another 12-year-old girl -- their friend -- it seems that the made-up meme could have inspired monstrous acts in real life. The young suspects were arrested after allegedly luring their innocent friend into the woods and stabbing her 19 times, according to authorities. And a criminal complaint says the suspects admitted they were trying to impress ""Slenderman,"" whom they read about on a horror website. But there is so much more to this story that parents and kids need to talk about. As the founder of a national nonprofit who has spent the last 10 years dedicated to helping kids and teens thrive in the digital world, here's what I know is true: We are raising our children in a hyper-connected, always on, and ever-evolving media and technology landscape that offers many opportunities, yet many challenges for families. In effect, we are conducting an experiment on our children in real time, and how it turns out for them depends a lot on us. It's very hard to keep up with what's new and what's popular with our kids, but the risks of not getting and staying involved in their digital lives is too high. Here's why: . The world of media is a super peer. It can influence our kids' social, emotional, cognitive, and physical development, and it can powerfully inform their sense of what's normal and acceptable. Stories, characters and their behavior in media -- whether in a video game, a movie, a TV show, or on a website -- can serve as role models, both good and bad. Do you know what your kids are watching, reading, and doing online? Do you know who shares their conversations and who plays in their games? And above all, are the media they're choosing appropriate for their age and developmental stage? Mature content may not be suited to immature and developing minds, especially in children, who often cannot comprehend the difference between reality and fantasy, and who cannot understand the consequences of violent acts. Media can be an amplifier in people, including children, who are at risk. Much more research is needed on the impact of violent media on behavior. But existing research suggests that people who are prone to violent actions, or depression, or anxiety, feel those feelings more strongly, or may be motivated to act on them, when exposed to violent content. Research also points to a correlation between repetitive viewing of violence and increased aggression and desensitization. The research is also uncovering a ""reciprocal"" relationship in which children with aggressive tendencies do, over time, seek out more violent media content and are even more affected by it than others, thus creating a downward spiral. Slenderman stabbing case: When can kids understand reality vs. fantasy? Parents are key to combating the negative effects of media. Our children are exposed to a great deal of content that may not be worthy of their time and attention. Even if your family limits certain unacceptable media at home, your kids can access that same content on any mobile device when they're not at home or with you. That's why it's imperative to engage with them about the media they're consuming. Take the time to elicit your kids' opinions on what's popular and what they're interested in, and share your opinions so as to help your kids develop the ability to view media critically and make choices that reflect your family's values. Every child and every family are different, so what works in my family may not work in yours. Each of us has different pain points, different views on what's appropriate, and different opinions on how much is too much. The reality for all of us, though, is that what happens online can influence what happens in real life. Parenting needs to happen in both places. That way our kids can thrive, even in the face of a made-up monster in a dark and digital world.","James Steyer: Until 12-year-old's stabbing, not many parents knew about ""Slenderman""

"(Mental Floss) -- Major League Baseball's umpires are all over the news after a spate of, er, questionable calls throughout this postseason. Despite larger postseason umpiring crews that include two extra umps in the outfield, it feels like an inordinate number of calls have gone the wrong way. All of these gaffes have prompted renewed debate about whether baseball should start using instant replay. How could umps blow this many calls that are so obvious when viewed in slow motion? Aren't these guys trained professionals? Are they handsomely rewarded? What do we really know about the men in blue, anyway? After some spotty officiating in the NFL last fall, we did some digging on the officials in the four major sports. Here's what we found: . They make good money . A National Football League ref can make anywhere from $25,000 to $70,000 a season, although since most of the games are on Sundays, they can also have other jobs during the week. (We'll get to those in a minute.) That cash comes with responsibilities, though. In addition to relaying the calls to the teams and fans, a ref is also the crew chief, or leader, of the seven-man officiating team that also includes an umpire, a field judge, a back judge, a line judge, a side judge, and a head linesman. Officials in other sports pull down more loot, but they have much more grueling schedules... • Baseball. According to MLB.com, MLB umpires get around $120,000 when they start out in the big leagues, and senior umps can earn upwards of $300,000. Between spring training, a 162-game schedule, and the postseason, being an MLB ump is a job that takes up most of the year. They are, however, well cared-for while on the road. Each ump gets a $340 per diem to cover hotel and food, and when they fly, it's always first class. Working a full postseason can tack on an extra $20,000, plus expenses. They also get four weeks of paid vacation during the regular season. These guys hang onto their jobs, too; on average, there's only one opening for a new big league ump each season. • Basketball. National Basketball Association refs are similarly well compensated. They earn anywhere from $100,000 to $300,000 for an 82-game season. There are some nice fringe benefits, too; when referee Tim Donaghy admitted to helping gamblers fix games, the NBA asked that he repay other benefits he'd pulled in over the course of his 13-year career, including $750 worth of sneakers and $4500 worth of free tickets. • Hockey. If you can skate and survive the occasional lockout, National Hockey League ref is hardly a bad job. Refs make between $110,000 and $255,000 while linesmen earn from $72,000 to $162,000. Mental Floss: Stories behind all 30 NHL team names . NFL refs have day jobs . Since NFL refs only work one day each week, they can have ""real"" jobs to supplement what they earn on any given Sunday. Some of them actually have pretty interesting jobs. • Mike Carey, my personal favorite ref, is an entrepreneur and inventor who holds eight patents for snow sports apparel. He founded and co-owns Seirus Innovation, a ski apparel company. • Walt Coleman is infamous in Oakland for being the ref in the ""Tuck Rule Game,"" but he's also a fifth-generation dairy farmer who once held the position of president of the Arkansas Dairy Products Association. • Walter Anderson became an official in the league in 1996 and got the promotion to referee in 2003. Prior to becoming a referee, he was better known as Dr. Walt Anderson, a dentist. • Tony Corrente is probably used to dealing with unruly crowds of guys from his day job as a high-school social studies teacher. • If Jeff Triplette seems hard to scare on the field, it's probably because he's seen worse. He was an Army Reserve colonel during the Persian Gulf War, where he was awarded a bronze star. Mental Floss: What's with those AFL throwback uniforms? • Bill Leavy is similarly tough; he spent 27 years as a police officer and firefighter in San Jose. • Ron Winter's not just a ref, he's also an associate professor in Western Michigan University's phys. ed. department. • Gene Steratore must love how he looks in stripes. In addition to being an NFL ref, he officiates NCAA hoops games and has drawn March Madness assignments in previous seasons. • And when Ed Hochuli isn't officiating a game (or working out), you might find him in a courtroom. He's a trial lawyer in the Arizona firm Jones, Skelton, and Hochuli, which employs over 80 attorneys. It's a long climb to the top . How does one become a ref? Most of these guys have humble beginnings as officials. Carey started officiating Pop Warner games in 1972 and gradually worked his way up through the college ranks. Eventually, he became an NFL side judge in 1990 and received a promotion to NFL referee, the pinnacle of football officiating, in 1995. Hochuli started as a Pop Warner ref in the early 1970s; he was a law school student who needed a little extra pocket cash. He then slowly made his way up through high school, junior college, and small conference college ball before getting a Pac-10 gig. He eventually made it to the NFL in 1990. It's a slow build, but if you stick it out long enough and have some natural talent, you can be the one patting his head to signal an ineligible receiver downfield. Still not convinced it's a tough ride? In a recent op-ed in The New York Times, former baseball commissioner Fay Vincent cited the paltry salaries for minor-league umps: just $9500 for a five-month season for junior umpires, and only $20,000 a season for guys who have risen all the way to Triple A ball.

"Kagadi, Uganda (CNN) -- The hospital at the center of an Ebola outbreak in Uganda is now dealing with 30 suspected cases, including five from Kibaale prison, Dr. Dan Kyamanywa said Thursday. Three patients at Kagadi hospital have been confirmed as having the virus, said Kyamanywa, a district health officer. Doctors are now testing the suspected cases urgently so they can separate confirmed cases from those who do not have the disease, Doctors Without Borders said. Suspected cases are still trickling into the hospital, Kyamanywa said. At least 16 people have died in the current outbreak. The five prisoners have been showing Ebola-like symptoms of vomiting, diarrhea and fever, the doctor said. ""We do expect the number of suspected cases to increase,"" he said. ""It's important to break transmission and reduce the number of contacts that suspected cases have."" There is a fear that the outbreak will spread to the capital, but it is unlikely, he said. Many patients fled Kagadi hospital when Ebola was confirmed, he said, and the hospital is struggling to respond to all the call-outs to suspected cases. Could the Ebola outbreak spread to the U.S.? ""Right now there is no treatment for Ebola, so the most effective measure we can take is to contain the spread of the disease,"" said Olimpia de la Rosa, the Doctors Without Borders emergency coordinator for Uganda Ebola intervention. ""That is why we need to start working immediately. Other cases need to be rapidly identified because containment is what can stop it,"" said the expert from the aid group, which is also known as Medecins Sans Frontieres. The Ugandan government has asked people in western Uganda to travel by public transport only if it is necessary. The outbreak began in the Kibaale district in western Uganda. The deaths have stoked heightened fear about the spread of the virus, a highly infectious, often fatal agent spread through direct contact with bodily fluids. Symptoms can include fever, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, a measles-like rash, red eyes and, at times, bleeding from body openings. Market day was canceled Wednesday after Uganda's president warned people not to gather in large groups. Health officials urged the public to report any suspected cases, to avoid contact with anyone infected and to wear gloves and masks while disinfecting bedding and clothing of infected people. Officials also advised avoiding public gatherings in the affected district. Teams in Uganda are taking an aggressive approach, including trying to track down anyone who came into contact with patients infected with the virus and health workers have been gearing up for better protection of health workers and an influx of cases. The workers include people from Uganda's ministry of health, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization. The outbreak initially went undetected because patients did not show typical symptoms, Ugandan Health Minister Dr. Christine Ondoa told CNN on Sunday. Patients had fevers and were vomiting, but did not show other typical symptoms, such as hemorrhaging. Diagnosis in an individual who has only recently been infected can be difficult since early symptoms, such as red eyes and skin rash, are seen more frequently in patients who have more common diseases, the CDC said. Uganda's Ministry of Health declared the outbreak in Kibaale district Saturday after the Uganda Virus Research Institute identified the disease as the Sudan strain of Ebola hemorrhagic fever. The Ebola virus was first detected in 1976 in the central African nation of Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo). The virus is named after a river in that country. There are five strains of Ebola viruses, all named after the areas where they were found: Zaire, Sudan, Cote d'Ivoire, Bundibugyo and Reston, according to the WHO.

"(CNN) -- He's made more money at the movies this year than Adam Sandler, Seth Rogen, invading aliens and yes, even Justin Bieber. His name is Rango, a strange-looking lizard with the voice of Johnny Depp, and he's the current king of the box office. In 2009, only one fully animated film, ""Up,"" was among the 10 biggest domestic grossers of the year. In 2010, the box office crown was taken by ""Toy Story 3,"" and it was among five films in the top 10. In both years, animated films grossed well over $1 billion. ""Rango"" isn't alone at the box office this year, either. Live-action/animation hybrid ""Hop"" has been the No. 1 movie for two weekends running, while the last weekend in February saw Disney's computer-animated romantic comedy ""Gnomeo & Juliet"" holding its own in its third week in theaters, just barely coming in second to that weekend's new comedy ""Hall Pass."" ""Gnomeo"" is approaching a total take of $100 million in the United States. This weekend sees the release of the animated musical ""Rio,"" which has already made more than $50 million internationally. The sequel ""Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs. Evil"" is out later this month. Animation as a box office force (despite a few exceptions) couldn't come about only because of families with young kids. Rabid fans of the genre often follow every release  and enjoy the artistic aspect of it as well as the fact that so many of the films work on a completely different level for adults. ""The output of animated features in the last few years has definitely opened up from when I was a kid 20 years ago,"" said Michael Howe, a writer for JimHillMedia.com, who has a degree in animation from Illinois Institute of Art-Chicago. ""There is a variety to the marketplace these days that can allow us to pick and choose from the pop-culture oriented fare from DreamWorks or allow us to seek out the unfamiliar like Studio Ghibli's 'Spirited Away.' "" Chicago resident Howe has been inspired since childhood by the medium: ""With animation, there is the potential to take us to new worlds or environments that seem somehow familiar, but have been tweaked in little ways. You can see this in the style of the very angular world of the film 'Madagascar,' and even the vehicle-themed environments in the world of 'Cars.'"" Twenty years ago, hand-drawn animation experienced a resurgence in popularity thanks to ""The Little Mermaid,"" ""Beauty and the Beast,"" and later, ""The Lion King."" When the first ""Toy Story"" was released in 1995, it heralded the eventual takeover by computer animation in feature films. Still, Disney was practically the only game in town. Toronto resident Mike Bastoli is one of many hardcore fans of Disney's Pixar animation studio, which has won the Best Animated Feature Oscar the past four years. ""The way they combine the art of storytelling with the technology they use is incredible,"" said Bastoli, who created the fan site The Pixar Blog in 2007 and was flown out to visit the studio last year. ""They really put a lot of attention into their story, more than any film studio out there, be it animated or live action. The story is what makes the movies work."" ""Pixar is really the only bulletproof brand left in Hollywood,"" said Boxofficeguru.com editor Gitesh Pandya. ""They haven't had a flop yet."" David A. Gross, editor and publisher of MovieReviewIntelligence.com, said a big reason for that is the broad appeal of the studio's recent releases. ""You hear adults talking about how they were moved by 'Toy Story 3,' and 'Up' was a great story about an older character. When they fire on all cylinders like that, the (box office) can really take off."" In 2001, the game changed again, when DreamWorks found success with ""Shrek,"" the first of four movies in that franchise (with the spinoff, ""Puss in Boots,"" due later this year). ""We've been very excited to see the growth and popularity of animation,"" said Anne Globe, head of worldwide marketing for DreamWorks Animation. In recent years, the studio's hits have included the first two ""Madagascar"" movies (a third is on the way in June 2012) and ""Kung Fu Panda,"" whose sequel, following the adventures of Jack Black's character, Po, will be released on May 26. Globe pointed out that ""Panda's"" official Facebook page has had great success, with more than 3 million ""likes"" from users. ""Certainly that is attributable to the popularity of the character,"" she said. ""Po and Shrek are both very popular on Facebook."" In 2002, the first of many ""Ice Age"" movies became a blockbuster for 20th Century Fox's Blue Sky Studios (a fourth film is due next year), and the company hopes to see similar success with ""Rio,"" especially with teens and beyond. The movie's partnership with the popular ""Angry Birds"" online game has been a huge success, and a performance by two of the movie's stars, Jamie Foxx and Will.i.am, on ""American Idol"" attempted to attract that show's audience via the soundtrack. ""Animated movies have become very unique in that in the last several years, they have become all-audience movies,"" said Jeffrey Godsick, executive vice president of marketing for 20th Century Fox. Through marketing campaigns like the one for ""Rio,"" he said, ""We are able to speak to the widest audience possible and can speak to different audience segments. Adults also know that there are jokes in the movie for them, that there's an emotional story for them."" It's hard to find a studio that hasn't jumped into the animation game. ""Almost all of the studios have really broken through: Sony did well with 'Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,' and Fox has done well with 'Ice Age,'"" said Gross. ""It's no longer just a Disney brand."" Paramount is the latest studio fairly new to the animation world to have a smash hit on its hands with ""Rango."" ""When you look at these animated movies like 'Despicable Me,' it was cute but it also had raw humor for adults. It was hip,"" said Gross. ""You see the same thing with 'Rango' now. It's cool looking. Johnny Depp appeals to everybody. These are much bigger than a 'kiddie' movie."" DreamWorks also strives to put out movies that will have broad appeal. ""It makes for a great audience response to our films,"" said Globe. ""In addition to the family audience, we've had great success with teens and tweens, and we hope to see the same reaction to 'Kung Fu Panda 2.'"" Animation is a fact of life in Hollywood beyond ""Shrek"" and ""Toy Story."" ""(Computer-generated imagery), which is used more and more in normal live action films, is now the bread and butter of the animation world,"" said iReporter Brett Martin, a film critic for the past 10 years and former entertainment reporter at Atlanta's WAGA-TV. ""In fact, CGI has advanced so much it is hard to tell the difference between animation and reality these days."" There seems to be no limit to the amount of animated fare we'll see coming out of Hollywood in the near future. ""With three major sequels, a prequel and a handful of other nicely timed releases, 2011 animation has the potential for similar growth"" to last year, said Martin, who gave his most glowing review of the year so far to ""Rango."" Aside from ""Puss in Boots,"" other highly anticipated films this year include ""Cars 2,"" ""Happy Feet 2,"" ""The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn,"" and the hand-drawn ""Winnie the Pooh."" DreamWorks recently announced several upcoming animated features, including ""How to Train Your Dragon 2,"" and a new version of ""Mr. Peabody & Sherman,"" for 2012 and beyond. For the ""Dragon"" franchise, a second movie is just the beginning. ""We were thrilled with the response for the first film, and subsequently fans are interested in what the sequel will be,"" said Globe. ""Also, Cartoon Network will be bringing forth a TV series in 2012."" (Cartoon Network, like CNN is a Time Warner company.) As long as the big box office numbers keep rolling in, moviegoers will continue to see more. As Pandya put it, ""When the movie is well-made and the marketing is done well, the rewards are enormous.""","Animated films have dominated the box office more and more in recent years .
Many studios are getting in on the action, beyond Disney and DreamWorks .

"Paris (CNN) -- After a week of deadly international protests against an anti-Islam film, a French satirical magazine is pouring oil on the fiery debate between freedom of expression and offensive provocation. The magazine Charlie Hebdo, which is known for outrageous humor, published cartoons featuring a figure resembling the Prophet Mohammed on Wednesday. The issue hit the stands eight days after a video mocking the Muslim prophet triggered angry protests, including one that led to the death of the U.S. ambassador to Libya. Stephane Charbonnier, director of the French magazine, said his staff is ""not really fueling the fire"" but rather using its freedom of expression ""to comment (on) the news in a satirical way."" ""It happens that the news this week is Mohammed and this lousy film, so we are drawing cartoons about this subject,"" Charbonnier told CNN affiliate BFM-TV on Wednesday. The magazine was directing its derision at ""this grotesque film,"" Charbonnier said, not the Muslim prophet. That ""grotesque film"" is ""Innocence of Muslims,"" a video that sat obscure on the Internet until September 11 when rioters, seizing on it, attacked the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, and killed U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. Protesters also breached the U.S. Embassy in Cairo, Egypt, the same day, and protests over the video have erupted in at least 20 countries since then. There has been no violence reported as a result of the Charlie Hebdo cartoons. But France will close embassies and schools in about 20 countries on Friday, the main Muslim day of prayer, as a precaution, the French Foreign Ministry said Wednesday. It is already boosting security in some locations, including its embassies, and police vehicles were parked outside the Paris offices of Charlie Hebdo late Tuesday. Any depiction of Islam's prophet is considered blasphemy by many Muslims. France has the largest Muslim population in Western Europe, with an estimated 4.7 million followers of the faith. The Charlie Hebdo cartoons are not labeled Mohammed, but several, including one that appears to show a man's naked rear end, could easily be interpreted as being depictions of Islam's prophet. France says it will not authorize protests over anti-Islam film . Charlie Hebdo journalist Laurent Leger said the magazine did not intend to provoke anger or violence. ""The aim is to laugh,"" Leger said. ""We want to laugh at the extremists -- every extremist. They can be Muslim, Jewish, Catholic. Everyone can be religious, but extremist thoughts and acts we cannot accept."" Leger defended the magazine, saying it was within its rights and not responsible for people's reactions. ""In France, we always have the right to write and draw. And if some people are not happy with this, they can sue us and we can defend ourselves. That's democracy. You don't throw bombs; you discuss, you debate. But you don't act violently. We have to stand and resist pressure from extremism."" French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault expressed his support for the freedom of press, but he said there are limits. ""We have a free press that can express itself right up to the point of caricature,"" Ayrault said Tuesday. ""But there is also a question of responsibility."" He assured the public that ""all the precautions will be taken"" to maintain order. The cartoons are provoking outrage among the French Muslim community, while other Muslims have accused the magazine of pandering for attention. Wednesday's cartoons were published a day after hundreds of Muslims took to Twitter to satirize the U.S. magazine Newsweek's cover story on ""Muslim Rage"" in which the Somali-born writer and former Muslim Ayaan Hirsi Ali said the recent protests represented mainstream Muslim opinion worldwide. Muslims shot back with tongue-in-cheek tweets about what really enrages them, such as having a really good hair day but no one notices because they're wearing hijabs. Hend Amry, who posted that tweet as @LibyaLiberty, said Charlie Hebdo's latest cartoons were a cynical attempt to inflate sales. She disputed the magazine's position that it just wants to provoke laughter and express its right to free speech. ""No it isn't. It's for ratings,"" she said. Opinion: Media don't get #MuslimRage . She compared it to the French magazine that printed topless photos of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge. ""Like printing tawdry pics of (Catherine) Middleton -- lowbrow rating booster,"" she said. ""If we're going to chart it on the Muslim insult-o-meter, it is less inflammatory than the 'film' but does continue the East/West divide we see,"" she told CNN. A South African student -- who said that what really enraged her was the release of the Batman movie ""The Dark Knight Rises"" during Ramadan -- said she had no intention of looking at the Charlie Hebdo cartoons. Tweeting as @oh_my_golly, she said: ""Refuse to be a pawn in a game where people deliberately insult beliefs&wish to incite hate/anger/violence citing 'free speech'"" Dalil Boubakeur, head of the Grand Mosque in Paris, condemned the cartoons ""in the strongest possible terms"" and expressed surprise that the magazine was running new Mohammed cartoons after its offices were attacked the last time it did so. ""To repeat the same stupidity, the same idiocy and the same calumnies, the same ignominy seems to us to be nearly psychotic action,"" he said. The magazine's offices were the scene of an attack in November when they were burned on the day the magazine was due to publish an issue with a cover appearing to make fun of Islamic law. The cover featured a bearded and turbaned cartoon figure of Mohammed saying, ""100 lashes if you're not dying of laughter."" The cartoonist known as Luz, who drew the cover, has been under police protection since then. Wednesday's issue does not have a Mohammed cartoon on the cover. ""We learned our lesson,"" Luz said. French Muslims feel like scapegoats for nation's problems . France has seen rising tensions over its rapidly growing Muslim minority. Last year, the country banned the wearing of Islamic veils and other face coverings, claiming they were both degrading and a security risk. Belgium has passed similar legislation, and Switzerland banned the building of minarets, the tall spires that often stand next to mosques. CNN's Dheepthi Namasivayam, Richard Allen Greene, Ana Bickford, Susannah Palk and Alex Felton contributed to this report.","Head of Grand Mosque in Paris condemns cartoons, expresses surprise .

"(CNN) -- She has eyelashes but no eyebrows. She has all her fingers but is missing four nails. Her skin is so taut now that she can no longer frown. But she can still smile. Her face tells a story of suffering. Her name, Shakira, tells a story of a new journey. Shakira means thankful. Last week, 4-year-old Shakira arrived in the United States for what her caretaker, Hashmat Effendi, hopes will be the start of the rest of her life. Shakira, discovered with severe burns in Pakistan, will undergo reconstructive surgery in January. She will never look fully normal, but Effendi hopes the surgery will make it easier for Shakira to grow older and help others see what Effendi has seen all along: an effervescent bundle of love. In 2009, Effendi was on a medical mission with Texas-based House of Charity in Pakistan's Swat Valley. The region's natural beauty was once compared to Switzerland's, but by then it was a Taliban-infested area rife with violence. One of the doctors found three little girls left in a trash bin. ""Who are they?"" the doctor asked. Nobody knew. Where were their parents? Where were they from? All anyone could say is that there had been a U.S. drone attack, though U.S. officials say that drones have never struck targets in Swat. It was not known how the girls came to be where they were but one thing was clear: they'd suffered horrific injuries. The doctor, who was traveling with House of Charity, took them back to a clinic. They were in grave condition. Two of the girls died, but the littlest one had a chance of making it if she were treated right away. She was only a year old, Effendi guessed, but small for her age. She was skinny. Dirty. Very bloody. She had fresh burns all over her face, her scalp and on her arms. Effendi began searching for the little girl's family. She needed their consent before doctors operated on her. But when no one stepped forward, doctors proceeded anyway to treat the burns. Otherwise, they would have to amputate her arm. Otherwise, she might not survive. Effendi named her Shakira. ""Life,"" she said, ""was a gift for her."" Effendi continued to look for relatives, even scattered posters of Shakira everywhere and solicited the help of the Pakistani army and a government official. But still, no one claimed her. Shakira was finally taken to Shalimar Hospital in Lahore, where she spent the next three years in a charity ward. Until last week. Effendi was finally able to bring Shakira back to Houston, where Effendi lives. When the Qatar Airways flight landed, Shakira turned to Effendi, whom she calls Mummy. ""Are we in America?"" she asked. ""Yes,"" Effendi replied. Shakira put her hands together and clapped. On the plane, Shakira had learned to count from 1 to 27 in English. It was a good start, Effendi thought. House of Charity has helped thousands of children with congenital birth defects or those who have been disfigured in war, but Shakira was special. Effendi raised three sons, who are grown. Her house once again filled with the mirth of a youngster. ""She's like my tail,"" Effendi said. ""She follows me around all day."" She took Shakira to McDonald's. Shakira gobbled up chicken nuggets. She learned that in America, chips were called French fries and tomato sauce was ketchup. Effendi was ironing her clothes Tuesday when Shakira ran up to her. ""Mummy, do you love me?"" she asked. ""How much?"" ""This much,"" Effendi said, gesturing. Shakira ran into the bathroom, stood in front of the mirror and started screaming. It was then that Effendi realized Shakira was overwhelmed. She had gone that day to meet her doctor, Robert McCauley, at the Shriners Hospital for Children in Galveston. He volunteered to do the reconstructive surgery. Shakira arrived in a turquoise striped dress, black leggings and white lacy socks. She wore beads around her neck and a big pink ring that House of Charity volunteer Larry Maxwell gave her. She called him ""Nana,"" the Urdu word for grandfather. At the hospital, Shakira touched McCauley's coat buttons; the nurse's stethoscope. She referred to McCauley as her doctor and understood as best a child could that he was trying to make her well. ""It's not easy and it's not a single-day procedure,"" McCauley said about the surgery. He will start January 16 with her right hand. He will never be able to give her eyebrows or restore the missing nails on four of her fingers. Sometimes, when Shakira eats spicy food, her flesh feels raw and irritated. She will have to always be careful about that. He will never be able to fix the severe discoloration on her forehead. But he hopes to reconstruct her nose, fix her eyes. Shakira took it all in stride at the hospital. But it was that sense of belonging and being loved that was alien for her, Effendi realized. It was overwhelming. ""She needs security,"" Effendi said. ""Yesterday was a very emotional day for her."" Effendi had been working with children for 25 years. But Shakira was teaching her new things. Effendi hopes Shakira will be adopted by a family in the United States. It would be unfair, she said, to send Shakira back to Pakistan. She has no one there. For now, Shakira will adjust to life in America in Effendi's home. Effendi may never know where Shakira came from or who claimed her as a daughter. But she knows she was able to give Shakira new life -- and a name that could not have been more fitting.","A doctor found the little girl in a trash bin in Pakistan's Swat Valley .

"(CNN) -- Before my parents left Taiwan in 1967, they were given a gift box full of America: A collection of the greatest Broadway cast recordings of all time, lovingly pressed into 50 sleek disks of vinyl. For over a decade, the contents of the box were the only music played in our home. My sister and I came of age listening to Rodgers and Hammerstein, Lerner and Loewe, Sondheim and Styne and Strauss. And when we were finally ushered into the dark of an actual Broadway playhouse to experience firsthand the unique alchemy that occurs when music and theater meet, we were hooked for life. All of this is just to explain why I'm conflicted by the controversy that's erupted over the recent revival of W.S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan's comic operetta ""The Mikado,"" which is being presented in celebration of the 60th anniversary of Seattle's Gilbert & Sullivan Society, one of the oldest light opera companies in the nation. It's hardly surprising that the Society would choose ""The Mikado"" for its diamond jubilee year. It is the most frequently staged of Gilbert and Sullivan's operettas and a perennial favorite of the Society. Every time, they have done it the same way: As a photocopy of the Victorian original, with Caucasian actors wearing garish facepaint and outfits that cartoonishly approximate traditional Japanese garb. There's a term for this kind of racial costuming: Yellowface. It's a phenomenon that seems to be resurgent. We saw it in Katy Perry's geisha-inspired performance at the American Music Awards in November, in a January episode of the hit sitcom ""How I Met Your Mother"" and a month later, in the opening sketch of the venerable comedy program ""Saturday Night Live."" Each time, the use of yellowface has been defended as loving homage or harmless parody. Each time, when Asian-Americans have pointed out that we don't find the wearing of cosmetics and wardrobe to simulate Asian appearance to be ""loving"" or ""harmless,"" our concerns have been dismissed. Which is why, despite my deep personal love of musical theater, I think these ""traditional"" productions -- yellowface productions -- of ""The Mikado"" have to end. They are the deep-drilled root of the yellowface weed: the place from which the scourge keeps springing back, even when its surface expressions are plucked. There are older examples of yellowface in entertainment than ""The Mikado,"" but none so popular, and certainly none that have been as popular among mass audiences for as long -- 129 years and counting. I want to be clear that I'm not saying that ""The Mikado"" shouldn't be performed at all. Its biting satire and splendidly silly stage play make it quite possibly Gilbert and Sullivan's greatest work. But when it is performed by an all-white troupe of actors dressed and made up as Asians, it shifts from a brilliant comedy of manners to, as Asian-American actress and blogger Erin Quill says, a ""racist piece of crap."" Quill, a musical theater veteran and original cast member of the bawdy Off-Broadway hit ""Avenue Q,"" is actually quoting herself. That's the first line spoken by Cheryl, the character she plays in the indie film ""The Mikado Project,"" a mockumentary that follows an Asian-American theater troupe forced to put on a production of ""The Mikado"" in order to stave off bankruptcy. ""In the movie, the artistic director makes a desperate attempt to convince us that it won't look like yellowface, because underneath the costumes and makeup, it's Asians playing Asians -- or at least the Asians white people think we are,"" says Quill, who also co-wrote the screenplay. ""Obviously, the company is not down for it."" By demonstrating that Asians can't present a ""traditional"" version of the show without looking and feeling ridiculous, the film aptly exposes the uncomfortable racial reality behind operetta's fanciful farce. But it then goes on to show how little it takes to make a version of ""The Mikado"" that isn't offensive: A commitment to multiethnic casting and an end to the use of makeup to ape ""exotic"" Asian features. And while we're at it, maybe change the cast names to something that don't sound like schoolyard slurs? There's no reason why Nanki-Poo, Ko-Ko and Yum-Yum couldn't be Namihiko, Kaku and Yume, all names that Japanese humans might actually be called. Change is painful. Hardcore fans find the suggestion of any kind of alteration of G&S's works to be anathema. But live theater is unsettled and organic by nature. No two performances are the same, and shows are revived time and again, with each new production adding contexts that enhance rather than erase the original. Indeed, ""The Mikado"" has seen the wildest set of adaptations of all of Gilbert and Sullivan's works. 1939 saw the first staging of ""The Hot Mikado,"" a jazzed-up edition of the opera featuring an all-black cast, which has since itself been revived dozens of times. In 1987, Monty Python member Eric Idle headlined a much-celebrated version of ""The Mikado"" for British television, which was traditional in all respects, except for resetting the antics at an English seaside resort. Even ""traditional"" productions embrace mutability and modernity. The song ""I Have a Little List,"" sung by Ko-Ko the Lord High Executioner, details a lengthy set of individuals who ""never would be missed"" if they were to encounter the business end of a chopper. Every ""Mikado"" production customizes the lyrics of the song, rewriting them to lampoon present-day celebrities and situations. If Ko-Ko can sing about Kardashians and customer service operators, there isn't any reason why the rest of the play can't be updated as well. A hundred and thirty years ago, Asia was exotic and alien and strange; today, sushi is sold in 7-Elevens (now a Japanese-owned chain!) and there are 18 million Americans who trace our ancestry to that continent, but keep our homes and hearts right here.

"(CNN) -- While most professional golfers pride themselves on using the latest whiz-bang equipment, deep within the Scottish countryside a very different tournament is taking place -- one where the players are happily swinging antiques. In fact, anyone watching the World Hickory Open Championship could be forgiven for thinking they'd stumbled 100 years back in time. It's not just the old-fashioned equipment -- wooden-shafted clubs that date back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries -- but also the clothes: the players trek across this dramatic landscape dressed in plus fours and flat caps for the men and long skirts for the women. It's as if they are unwitting sports hipsters. ""Hickory golf has taken on a new lease of life in the past few years because, I'm not sure I really like the word, but it's a bit sort of retro,"" Lionel Freedman, co-founder and director of the World Hickory Open, tells CNN. ""It's almost anti-modern in some ways."" Freedman has played his own role in hickory golf's ascent over the past decade with the creation of the tournament, which takes place at Panmure Golf Club on the east coast of Scotland on Tuesday and Wednesday. Upon joining the British Golf Collectors' Society -- founded in 1987 off the back of the U.S. version created 17 years previously -- he became aware of a number of hickory events that initially grew out of members wanting to test their antique clubs. Keen to promote the movement to the masses, Freedman decided to introduce an open competition of his own that anybody could play in, and so the maiden World Hickory Open was staged in 2005 at the Old Golf Course in Musselburgh, Scotland -- recognized by many as the oldest course in the world and the oldest on which play has been continuous. ""I cheekily called it the World Hickory Open, which was a bit of a joke really,"" Freedman says. ""I held the first tournament -- 36 people played and I had to give out 36 sets of clubs. But everybody enjoyed it so much, so I said I would continue it."" And so he did, with Freedman's brainchild having gone from strength to strength, annually touring some of Scotland's most prestigious courses and becoming one of the world's leading hickory tournaments in the process. Next year, it will take place at Carnoustie Golf Links to become the first modern hickory tournament to be played on a current British Open Championship course. Freedman estimates that 90% of the 100-plus competitors this week -- including ex-professional golfers -- will arrive fully-stocked with their own antique equipment. ""Over the years it's developed and it now really is a World Hickory Open,"" he says. ""My tournament this year will have Americans, Swedes, Germans, Swiss, South Africans, Australians, English and Scots."" What is it that attracts these golfers from around the globe to hunt down a rare club made out of wood, when a souped-up version with the latest technological advancements is so readily available instead? It's a chance to play on some of the game's oldest courses, which by today's standards are often considered too short and antiquated due to the distance the ball can be hit with modern clubs. Courses dating back to the 1930s and older are often around 1,000 yards shorter than those the likes of Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods find themselves playing on week-in, week-out, and so offer a different kind of challenge for hickory golfers, who also play with an older type of ball. ""I don't think the modern golf course can get any longer, it's a joke,"" Freedman says. ""On the great old courses you walk straight from the green onto the next tee. With the modern golf course you might walk 50-100 yards for the next tee, so you need an enormous piece of land and it takes you much longer to go round."" According to Paolo Quirici, who is defending his title at Panmure, this is golf in its purest form. ""It's all about distance in the modern game and the putting becomes even more the game inside the game,"" says the 46-year-old Swiss golfer, a member of the European Tour from 1989-2001. ""In the old days, I think the skill of the player was really more put into value, whereas today the clubs are much better than they used to be so many players can get away with hitting bad shots."" For Freedman, that thrill of finally connecting with a more technically challenging swing is the true essence of hickory golf. ""The reason I have a passion for hickory golf is because you really know when you've hit a good shot. You don't know when you've had a good shot until you hit the sweet spot from the face of the club,"" he says. ""The modern club is much more forgiving. I know with a modern club, if I haven't connected properly I still get a result. It's almost like you're cheating a bit. But if I do that with a hickory, you don't get the result."" One worry for the movement of hickory golf, however, is that, as time passes by, antique clubs inevitably begin to become that much harder to locate. Fewer and fewer companies manufacture modern authentic versions today -- St. Andrews Golf Company is one -- and certain collectors will always prefer to hang their clubs up on the wall rather than sample them out on the golf course. Some tournaments, including those held by the British Golf Collectors' Society, state that pre-1935 golf clubs, and not replicas, must be used. ""If I have a wish, it's that people who are collecting the clubs considered giving some of those clubs back onto the market to try to get people into hickory golf. People would enjoy it a lot more if they had the old clubs to play with,"" Quirici says. ""I have been repairing over the past few years about 10 sets of clubs, then I resell them to friends who want to start hickory golf. I don't like to keep them in the house, I want to keep the movement of hickory golf going."" However, Freedman is sure hickory golf will continue to attract waves of new players in the years to come. ""I don't think there's any doubt that it will continue to grow,"" he says. ""I've already been asked if I will hold a World Hickory Open at a golf course in 2017 to celebrate their 150th anniversary. It's definitely got a bit of wind in its sails.""","World Hickory Open Championship set for its 10th year this week at Panmure .

"(CNN) -- When a flight of military helicopters descended into a field in the small village of Gruta, Poland, on Tuesday, residents had reason to be alarmed. After all, the village is only about 100 miles (161 kilometers) from the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. And with current tensions between Poland and its NATO allies and Russia over the situation in Ukraine, well, it would be natural to worry. But it turned out this was more treat than threat. The six copters were U.S. Army. The five Black Hawks and one Chinook were on their way back to their temporary base in Poland from NATO exercises in Lithuania when bad weather forced them to land in the Gruta field, a Polish military spokesman told Bloomberg News. Whoever could in the village of 1,600 people flocked to the scene, according to the town's website, chatting with the U.S. troops and posing for pictures. ""It's a big treat to be able to see up close such a colossus,"" the website said of the twin-rotor CH-47 Chinook. Town residents posed for pictures with the troops and the machine. ""Thank God it was the Americans,"" the town's mayor, Halina Kowalkowska, told Bloomberg. But she said the town's excitement may have made residents forget their hospitality. ""Now, when I think about it, we could have served them some food, but we were in shock and the boys had to go,"" Bloomberg quoted her as saying.","Bad weather forces six helicopters to land .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Sen. Barack Obama's 30-minute TV ad, which ran simultaneously on broadcast and cable networks at 8 p.m. ET Wednesday, is muscle-flexing that has little precedent, a campaign advertising expert said. Sen. Barack Obama aired a 30-minute campaign ad Wednesday night. ""It's evidence, if you needed any, that the Obama campaign has more money than there is ad time left to buy,"" said Evan Tracey, director of the Campaign Media Analysis Group. ""This is flexing the muscles."" Tracey estimates that it will cost the campaign ""in the $4 to 5 million range -- at a minimum, $3.5 million."" But, he said, spending the money is a ""no-brainer"" for the Democratic presidential hopeful. ""The strategic brilliance of this for Obama is that he is going to consume about 24 hours of the news cycle,"" Tracey said. ""It boxes [John] McCain in, takes the oxygen out of the room."" In the carefully produced infomercial, Obama laid out his plans for the economy and for bringing an end to the war in Iraq. It also featured stories of struggling families in swing states such as Ohio and Missouri and included testimonials from high-profile supporters, including Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius and New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson. iReport.com: What do you want to ask Sen. Obama? Obama's Republican opponent, Arizona Sen. John McCain, was not mentioned, nor was the GOP. The spot ended with a brief, live Obama address to a rally in Florida, another hotly contested state in this year's campaign. ""I'm reminded every single day that I am not a perfect man,"" he said. ""I will not be a perfect president. ""But I can promise you this: I will always tell you what I think and where I stand. I will always be honest with you about the challenges we face. I will listen to you when we disagree. And, most importantly, I will open the doors of government and ask you to be involved in your own democracy again."" There was so much buzz surrounding the infomercial -- which was announced about two weeks ago -- that on Tuesday, Time magazine's Mark Halperin put the ad's two editors on his daily list of the ""five most important people in American politics not running for president.""  Watch more on the Obama campaign ad buy » . Those editors, Erik Smith and Mark Putnam, were ""still in an edit room"" cutting the 30-minute piece Tuesday when he published the list, according to Halperin, Time's editor-at-large and senior political analyst. The ad ran at 8 p.m. ET on CBS, NBC, MSNBC, Fox, BET, TV One and Univision, the Spanish-language network, six days before Election Day. CNN declined to run the spot, and talks between ABC and the Obama campaign fell apart. ""We were approached by the Obama campaign and declined their request,"" said Sal Petruzzi, senior vice president for public relations of Turner Broadcasting, CNN's parent company. ""We did not want to pre-empt our programming lineup with a 30-minute spot. We would rather use our air to continue to cover the campaign, candidates and issues like we always do, from all points of view with the best political team on television."" An ABC spokeswoman declined to comment about the network's talks with the Obama campaign. ""As a matter of policy we don't comment about clients with whom we are doing business,"" said Julie Hoover of ABC. The Obama campaign has bought advertising on ABC in the past, she said, ""but they did not buy the half-hour."" Obama taped an interview Wednesday with ABC's Charles Gibson, which is to run Thursday, his campaign said. A source familiar with ABC policy suggested the network had offered the Obama campaign a different time slot. ""Hypothetically, we would have offered them equivalent time,"" the source said. ""We don't have to give them the exact slot they are asking for."" Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton said ABC had ultimately offered Obama the slot he wanted, but the campaign turned it down. ""By the time they agreed, we had already committed our resources,"" Burton said. The Obama campaign reported last week that it had raised a record-shattering $150 million in September. Obama has outspent McCain by a huge margin, according to CNN's consultant on ad spending. Between the time the two candidates clinched their party's nominations in the spring and October 25, Obama spent more than $205 million on TV ads. McCain spent more than $119 million, according to TNS Media Intelligence/Campaign Media Analysis Group. The McCain campaign launched an ad Wednesday attacking Obama for his 30-minute special. ""Behind the fancy speeches, grand promises and TV special lies the truth: With crises at home and abroad, Barack Obama lacks the experience America needs,"" the ad said. The timing of Obama's informercial pushed back the start of a World Series game, provoking a jab from McCain during a Wednesday afternoon appearance in Florida. ""It used to be that only rain or some other act of God could delay the World Series,"" he said. ""But I guess network executives figured an Obama infomercial was close enough."" The Obama campaign did not ask that the game be delayed, said a spokesman for Fox, which broadcasts the World Series. ""They asked Fox to buy the air time,"" the spokesman said. ""Fox went to our partner, Major League Baseball, and asked if it would be OK to delay the game to take this important political advertisement. They agreed."" MLB's willingness to delay the fall classic for a political ad shows how very unusual the Obama TV spot is. ""Ross Perot did it in 1992, but it wasn't this close to Election Day, and now you have a very different media consumption environment. You didn't have the cable then,"" Tracey said. ""There is no precedent for this sort of an ad this late in the race.""

"(CNN) -- In September 1970, a 28-year-old Jochen Rindt led the Formula One World Championship heading into the Italian Grand Prix at Monza. A crash during the final practice session ahead of the race took the life of the man in pole position for the title, whilst at the same time providing him with a unique position in sporting history. Rindt's supremacy in the drivers' championship was such that, despite his death, none of his fellow racers could overhaul his lead in the standings, making Jochen the only posthumous world champion in Formula One. In a strange twist of fate, the Austrian lost his life in almost the same place on the Monza track as his childhood icon, German driver Wolfgang von Trips -- after a brake failure on his Lotus saw him crash into the famous Parabolica curve at nearly 150 mph. Author of ""Jochen Rindt: Der erste Popstar der Formel 1,"" Herbert Völker recalls a man who, prior to his fatal crash, boosted the profile of the entire sport. ""Motorsport, at least in Europe, stayed in a quiet corner,"" Völker told CNN. ""It took a new type of personality to give it broader attendance. There were only two guys who fit that picture; the Scotsman Jackie Stewart and Jochen Rindt."" Völker believes Jochen -- who was orphaned as an infant when his parents were killed in a bombing raid -- had a star quality that transcended the sport. ""He did have a very special face that you wouldn't forget easily,"" he said. ""He married a beautiful girl from Finland and he was outspoken in a way that had nothing to do with the identical phrases of sports champions. ""And of course he was a spectacular driver. He had a sense for car control that allowed him to master situations that had rarely been seen before, not to mention afterwards."" Fittingly, Völker believes Rindt's finest  victory was his last, the first F1 grand prix to be held at Hockenheim in 1970. The track had taken the life of the legendary Scottish racer Jim Clark two years previously, and the German Grand Prix was only switched to the new venue on the insistence of the drivers, who believed it was a safer alternative to the Nurburgring. Heading into the race, Rindt lead Australian Jack Brabham by 11 points in the drivers' championship, but both were behind Ferrari's Jacky Ickx on the grid, with the Belgian driver starting in pole position. ""[Rindt] in the Lotus, and Jacky Ickx were close,"" recalls Völker. ""In their  top speed and everything. They overtook each other 30 or 40 times, and in such a fair manner that they used their fingers to show which the side the other one could overtake safely. ""To point out which side was safer was a fine, fine way of racing. It was perfect for the spectators and they loved it. In the end Jochen won by tenths of a second and it was just fantastic."" Such acts of sportsmanship were typical of a golden generation of drivers such as Jack Brabham, Bruce McLaren, Stewart, Ickx and Rindt according to Volker. And between Rindt and Stewart's there was friendship to accompany the rivalry: ""He was a great friend and he had a great sense of humor,"" Stewart told CNN. ""We traveled together a lot, to and from races because we were both living in Switzerland from 1968. We were living 300 meters apart [on Lake Geneva], so Jochen was a close friend, and Nina (Jochen's wife) still is."" Despite the highly competitive arena in which they dueled, Stewart believes the  dangers in F1 during that time contributed to respect between drivers. ""Motor racing in those days was very dangerous,"" he said. ""During my period, if you raced in Formula One for five years there was only a one in three chance you were going to live. ""The respect you had for other drivers was absolutely paramount, and that relationship extended from our friendship to our respect of each other on the track. ""I cannot think of one occasion when Jochen and I were racing hard together and conducted ourselves in anything other than the correct and appropriate fashion."" One of those occasions was the British Grand Prix in 1969, where Jochen was on pole, with his close friend right behind him. ""We had 30 lead changes between him and I, in one race. That's not even heard of today. ""It was slipstreaming, it was passing. We used it intelligently; we were using the track correctly and behaving correctly. That doesn't mean we were old fashioned at all, it means we were intelligent and respectful."" At the end of race, Stewart beat off the challenge from Rindt who eventually settled for fourth place. ""One of my great memories is being able to race as close as we did that day with someone who was also my close friend. That's a lasting memory for me."" It was Stewart who lost his title to Rindt in 1970, a for the Scot there was no more deserving opponent. ""The combination of Jochen Rindt and the Lotus in 1970 was, in my opinion unbeatable. In his time, Jochen was one of the top two or three drivers in the world,"" he said. Lotus -- who are sponsored by CNN -- re-entered Formula One at the start of the 2010 season, following a 16-year break from the sport. Team principal Tony Fernandes said his team owe a debt to Rindt's talent. ""Jochen Rindt holds a very special place in the hearts of all Formula One and Lotus fans,"" said Fernandes. ""He showed his God-given skills in F1, winning and doing so with style. ""At Lotus Racing we know we are standing on the shoulders of giants when racing with the Lotus name. We are all very proud to play our part in helping keep his memory alive.""","Jochen Rindt won the Formula One World Championship in 1970 .

"New York (CNN) -- A New Hampshire jury on Monday found a Nashua woman guilty of second-degree murder for running over a man who had heckled her for being a New York Yankees fan. Ivonne Hernandez, 45, was accused in the May 2008 killing of 29-year-old Matthew Beaudoin. Prosecutors said the confrontation began as a dispute between Hernandez and a female friend of Beaudoin's outside a bar. It escalated when Beaudoin noticed a large Yankees decal in the rear window of Hernandez's Dodge Intrepid and started to taunt her about the major league baseball team. When Hernandez started to drive away, Beaudoin briefly followed the car on foot. Hernandez then turned her car around and returned to the alley where Beaudoin and his friends remained and struck him. He later died from his injuries, which included multiple skull fractures. The defense argued Hernandez's actions were accidental -- a byproduct of her disorientation and panic after the confrontation. But prosecutors said in New Hampshire Superior Court, ""a few curse words and some insults to a baseball team do not justify murder."" Beaudoin's sister, Faith, said her family was delighted with Monday's verdict. It's ""absolutely wonderful to have a Christmas gift like this,"" she told CNN. The prosecution also expressed satisfaction with the jury's decision. ""We're very pleased with the verdict,"" senior assistant attorney general Susan Morrell said. ""We believe it's a fair and just verdict based on the evidence."" Calls to Hernandez's attorneys weren't returned Monday.

"(Reader's Digest)  -- ""Would you marry the same person again?"" could be a dangerous question. However, an international poll conducted in 15 countries reveals that 68 percent of respondents, and even more women, would again say ""I do"" to their spouse. The survey, which was conducted by Reader's Digest and published in the March issue, reveals that China has the highest level of spousal satisfaction (83 percent.) Also at the top of the list: The Philippines, Germany and the Netherlands. The United States came in at number 12 for satisfaction levels (63 percent) and Malaysia last (59 percent.) On average, men were more dissatisfied with their wives than women with their husbands. Malaysia tops the list with 48 percent of men stating they would untie the knot if given the chance. In Italy, however, 42 percent of the women would say ""arrivederci"" to their husbands. Peggy Northrop, VP/Global Editor-in-Chief, Reader's Digest, said: ""In the countries where marrying young is part of the culture, people seem to have a long time to wonder 'What if?' The survey results reminded me of the saying 'Marry in haste, regret at leisure.' Age and wisdom still influence marital satisfaction."" In the United States, Brazil, and Great Britain, respondents over age 45 are more likely than younger people to feel satisfied with their choices. But in Canada, France, India, Malaysia, and Spain, it is the 45-and-unders who feel more happily matched. In the Philippines, where couples marry younger than in most nations, only 20 percent of those over age 45 say they would stay with the same spouse.

"(CNN) -- A Canadian porn actor suspected of killing and dismembering a university student in Montreal pleaded not guilty Tuesday to all the charges against him, the prosecution office in Quebec said. Luka Rocco Magnotta, 29, faces first-degree murder and other charges in the death and dismemberment of Jun Lin, a 33-year-old Concordia University student from China. Ahead of the hearing, police said Magnotta would appear in the Montreal courtroom via video link. He arrived in Canada on Monday from Germany, a police official said. He was in police custody when he flew back aboard a Canadian military plane. Magnotta did not fight extradition from Germany after his arrest there this month. ""Now the alleged killer is in Montreal, and he'll be facing justice,"" police spokesman Cmdr. Ian Lafreniere told reporters Monday at the Montreal-Mirabel International Airport, where the suspect's plane touched down in the company of half a dozen officers. ""This is not the end of the investigation,"" Lafreniere said. Authorities accuse Magnotta of dismembering Lin and mailing one of his hands and one of his feet to Canadian politicians. Police link Vancouver body parts to Montreal dismemberment suspect . Police also believe Magnotta filmed the death and dismemberment and posted the video to the Internet. They have said the video shows Magnotta engaged in sexual acts involving body parts and also includes evidence of cannibalism. The Canadian government worked with Montreal police, the Quebec Prosecution Service and German officials to bring about Magnotta's extradition, officials said. Berlin police arrested Magnotta at an Internet cafe where he was browsing articles about himself. An employee of the cafe recognized him and flagged down a carload of German police trainees. The arrest ended an international manhunt that began after the body parts were mailed. Authorities have said they believe Magnotta killed Lin on May 24 or 25, posted the video, then flew to France on May 26. He was thought to have boarded a bus to Berlin on June 1 while police were searching for him in Paris, Berlin prosecutors have said. The sick fascination with a death video . The case began when a caller complained to police about a strong smell coming from an alley behind Magnotta's Montreal apartment building, Lafreniere has said. Investigators found a torso stuffed inside a suitcase. The same day, officials at Canada's Conservative Party headquarters received a package addressed to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper that contained a foot. Officials later intercepted a package addressed to the Liberal Party that contained a hand. DNA tests showed both were Lin's, Lafreniere has said. The victim's head is still missing. A gay porn actor, stripper and escort, Magnotta was well known to animal rights activists online, who accused him of killing kittens and using the carcasses in sexual acts. Authorities have said they were looking into the animal-abuse allegations and also examining possible links to other crimes.

"Washington (CNN) -- Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan received critical cover from moderate Republicans on Thursday on two issues likely to dominate her upcoming confirmation hearings: gays in the military and judicial experience. Kagan has been strongly criticized by GOP leaders for her efforts to block military recruiters from Harvard University during her time as the school's law school dean because of the military's ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy. The policy, opposed by President Obama, prevents gays and lesbians from serving openly in the armed forces. Top Republicans have also highlighted the fact that Kagan has never served as a federal judge, something that distinguishes her from all nine current members of the high court. If party moderates break from the GOP leadership on these issues, it dramatically increases Kagan's chances of overcoming a possible filibuster and winning confirmation as the country's 112th Supreme Court justice. Massachusetts GOP Sen. Scott Brown -- who broke the Democrats' 60-member filibuster-proof majority by winning the late Ted Kennedy's seat in January -- said after meeting with Kagan that he is satisfied she supports members of the military. ""It was the first question I actually asked her because, having been in the military, I had concerns about [her] position at Harvard,"" Brown said. ""It was very clear to me, after we spoke about it at length, that she is supportive of the men and women who are fighting to protect us and very supportive of the military as a whole. I do not feel that her judicial philosophy will hurt the men and women who are serving."" While dean at Harvard Law, Kagan said she ""abhorred"" the military's ""discriminatory recruitment policy."" She called it ""a profound wrong -- a moral injustice of the first order."" Kagan supported other schools' challenges to a federal law requiring that recruiters be given equal access or face the loss of federal funding. The Supreme Court unanimously upheld the law in 2006. Earlier in the day, Maine GOP Sen. Susan Collins said she doesn't have any concerns about Kagan's experience. She also said she didn't see any ""extraordinary circumstances"" that could lead her to join a potential filibuster against Kagan. Collins said that Kagan told her she considers Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 ruling establishing a constitutional right to abortion, to be settled law. Kagan herself has remained tight-lipped when asked such questions from reporters. The support of Brown and Collins alone, combined with a unified Democratic caucus, would be enough to ensure Kagan's confirmation. In addition to meeting with Brown and Collins on Thursday, Kagan stopped by the offices of five key Senate Democrats: Massachusetts' John Kerry, New York's Chuck Schumer, Maryland's Ben Cardin, Minnesota's Amy Klobuchar and Pennsylvania's Arlen Specter. Specter said Kagan may be open to the idea of allowing television coverage of Supreme Court hearings. ""She said it'd be helpful to the public and to the court,"" he said. ""This was the best answer I've gotten"" from any recent Supreme Court candidate. Specter is a staunch advocate of allowing television cameras into the high court. Most justices, however, have adamantly opposed the idea. Specter also said Kagan stood by comments she made in 1995, when she dismissed the confirmation hearing process as a ""charade."" Kagan's meeting with Specter attracted considerable attention because of his political troubles. Specter -- who is facing a tough primary fight next week -- voted against Kagan for solicitor general before switching from the Republican Party to the Democratic Party. Specter has not said how he will vote on her Supreme Court nomination. Some political observers have speculated that his previous opposition to Kagan, combined with an unwillingness to immediately back her now, could undercut his support with stalwart Democrats. A quick declaration in favor of Kagan, on the other hand, could strike some voters as political opportunism. Kagan kicked off her Capitol Hill meetings on Wednesday, visiting Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky. She also met with Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, and Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the committee's top Republican. Obama nominated Kagan on Monday to replace retiring Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens. If confirmed, she would become the third woman on the current nine-member bench and the fourth woman in the court's history.

"(CNN) -- Chris Martinez, just 20 years old when he was gunned down at a deli Friday in California, dreamed of being a lawyer like his dad. Now his grieving father, Richard Martinez, has emerged as the public face of gun control advocates in the aftermath of the six killings in Isla Vista. Three of the victims were shot, including his only son. The gunman also shot himself, police said. Chris Martinez, a college student, had gone to get a snack at the I.V. Deli Mart when the gunman opened fire. Richard Martinez says his child died because of gutless politicians. ""Where is the leadership? Where is the friggin' politicians that will stand up and say, 'We need to do this. We're gonna do something,'"" he told CNN. ""Those gutless bastards did nothing. And my son died because of it. And it's outrageous. Absolutely outrageous."" Martinez told CNN that he was furious that lawmakers had done nothing since the Sandy Hook Elementary School killings in Connecticut in December 2012. His son died, he said, because of that inaction. Their inaction was not just related to gun laws; it also was in the lack of progress toward solving a mental health crisis, he told CNN. The two issues are interconnected, he said. At the same time he grieves for his son, he feels for the parents of the 20 children and six adults who died at their elementary school. ""Those parents lost little kids. It's bad enough I lost my 20 year old. I had 20 years with my son,"" he screamed through tears. ""That's all I'll ever have. Those people lost their little 6- and 7-year-olds. How do you think they feel? And who's talking to them now? Who's doing anything for them now?"" Congress's efforts to enact stricter federal gun laws fizzled in April of last year, when a bill that included stronger federal background checks for gun purchases failed to pass the Senate. We've been here before: Will California shooting revive gun debate? 'We need to hold them accountable' Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee, told CBS that if the Assault Weapons Ban of 2013 had passed, it would have provided more mental health resources in addition to strengthening the background check system. ""I really sincerely hope that this tragedy -- this unimaginable, unspeakable tragedy -- will provide an impetus to bring back measures that would keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people who are severely troubled or deranged, like this young man was, and provide resources. We need mental health resources,"" the senator from Connecticut said. Sen. John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota, said legislative debate should center on mental health issues related to violence. ""I think that is something on which there is agreement,"" he told CBS. ""And that is where we ought to be focusing our efforts."" Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, said the Sandy Hook mass killings should have been enough to motivate Congress. ""We are taking steps to deal with the mental health issues, but obviously we've made very little progress, and it shows in these tragedies,"" he said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union with Candy Crowley."" Bob Weiss, whose daughter Veronika was killed outside a sorority house, said he wasn't ready to get political about the issue. ""I do know this, the people who write the laws, they work for us ... and we need to hold them accountable,"" he told CNN's Sara Sidner. ""If we're not holding them accountable, then we're accountable."" Opinion: I'm a gun owner and I want gun control . ""What about Chris' right to live?"" On Sunday, Martinez also gave a passionate statement to the media, saying: ""We don't have to live like this. Too many have died. We should say to ourselves, 'Not. One. More.'"" The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence issued a statement agreeing with Martinez and blaming the National Rifle Association and other gun rights groups for blocking political progress. Martinez also pointed a finger at the NRA for his son's death. ""They talk about gun rights. What about Chris' right to live?"" he said angrily. The NRA has not commented publicly since the killings. The organization also waited several days after the Sandy Hook attack before issuing a statement. ""Out of respect for the families, and as a matter of common decency, we have given time for mourning, prayer and a full investigation of the facts before commenting,"" the statement after Sandy Hook said. ""The NRA is prepared to offer meaningful contributions to help make sure this never happens again."" Martinez said he anticipated the NRA would say he's being overly emotional. ""I think I can be emotional and rational at the same time,"" he said. He said he wanted to be an advocate for the victims and to honor his son, who liked sports and competition and was an English major at the University of California at Santa Barbara. ""If there's all these things in the media about the shooter and nothing about the victims, it sends the wrong message,"" he said. ""People need to understand that real people died here.""

"(AOL Autos) -- President Barack Obama's new presidential limousine grabbed some headlines this year - especially in Detroit -- when General Motors announced in January that Obama was getting a brand-new 2009 Cadillac Presidential Limousine, the first presidential limo that did not carry a specific model name. The Obama limo has high-tech security features that Kennedy's limo lacked. That got me to thinking about another famous (or, perhaps more accurately, infamous) presidential limo -- one that for many years has been sitting on display, for all the world to see, at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, right in the heart of Ford country -- and just five minutes from my home. I'm referring to the 1961 Lincoln Continental 4-door convertible sedan that President John F. Kennedy was riding in on that historic / tragic day in November of 1963 when he was assassinated. Why would Obama's new limo prompt thoughts of the Kennedy limo? Well, perhaps in part because political commentators and historians have compared Obama to Kennedy, in terms of his charisma, his popularity and his call to service.  See the first armored presidential limo » . But it's also because the Kennedy limo represents a more innocent and less anxiety-ridden time in our nation's history. At the time of his assassination, Kennedy's limo had none of the high-tech features that protect Obama today -- nor was it even equipped with any of those features that have protected every other president since Kennedy. Indeed, it wasn't until after Kennedy's assassination that the Secret Service and the limo manufacturers thought to add all of the protective armor, bulletproof glass and other safety systems that have been considered pro-forma for more than 40 years. AOL Autos: Most affordable luxury cars . Direct comparisons between the JFK limo and Obama's new ride are difficult, because General Motors and the Secret Service, citing security concerns, have been tight-lipped about the Obama limo, not offering any details -- not even about the size or type of engine that powers it. In January, Nicholas Trotta, the assistant director for the office of protective operations, was quoted as saying that ""although many of the vehicles' security enhancements cannot be discussed, it is safe to say that this car's security and coded communications systems make it the most technologically advanced protection vehicle in the world."" AOL Autos: The latest car technology . The Detroit News also reported in January that the Obama limo has five-inch- thick heavy armor, run-flat tires, bulletproof glass and a completely sealed interior designed to thwart a chemical attack. GM declined to confirm that report, although those types of protective features/systems are not uncommon for modern-day presidential limousines. AOL Autos: 10 best cars of 2009 . Gazing at history . Once inside the Henry Ford Museum, in order to see the JFK limo, you walk past the 1952 Oscar Mayer Weinermobile, past the museum's displays of historic furniture and agricultural equipment, past its vintage pewter and silver collection. And, finally, there it is -- across the aisle from a yellow-orange 1927 Bluebird school bus and a neon-lit display that pays homage to the vintage roadside drive-ins and burger joints that are part of American-highway lore (McDonald's, A&W, White Castle, etc.). AOL Autos: Best car names of all-time . The JFK limo is parked right behind the 1972 Lincoln Continental limousine that Ronald Reagan was stepping into when he was shot in 1981. (The museum's collection of presidential limos also includes Dwight Eisenhower's 1950 Lincoln ""Bubbletop"" convertible sedan and Franklin D. Roosevelt's 1939 Lincoln ""Sunshine Special."") AOL Autos: Lincoln Continental . Many of us recall, from repeated viewings of the Zapruder-film footage of the assassination, that Kennedy's limo was midnight blue. But it's now black. In fact, it's been black since Lyndon Johnson ordered that new paint job in 1964, thinking that the midnight-blue color was too closely associated in the public mind with Kennedy's assassination. The JFK limo actually remained part of the White House fleet until 1978 -- meaning it was in use as late as the Carter administration, although not as the primary parade vehicle. After it was retired that year, Lincoln retained possession and then donated it to the museum. Viewing it today, as it sits surrounded by a waist-high, heavy-duty black iron fence, it definitely looks like a car that has seen some wear -- there are chips in the paint on the doors and fenders, and multiple scuffs on the bumpers. The rear passenger-side window - the one nearest to where Kennedy was sitting -- is about 80 percent lowered, allowing visitors to peer into the back seat and mentally re-visit that momentous day. ""Do Not Touch,"" reads a small black-and-white sign affixed to the top edge of the lowered window. Again, the JFK limo's complete lack of protective features at the time reminds us that 1963 was indeed a very different time in America. ""It didn't even have a permanent roof,"" says Bob Casey, the museum's curator of transportation. ""It was a convertible that only had removable steel and transparent-plastic roof panels, and they were not bullet-proof. The doors weren't bullet-proof, either, and it didn't have a special protective steel plate attached to the undercarriage."" What it did have was a 430-cubic-inch V8 engine that originally delivered 300 horsepower (after JFK's assassination, it was beefed up to 350 horses) -- plus small ""step-ups"" and grab handles for secret service agents. It also had a heavy-duty suspension, brakes, axle and tires to accommodate extra weight. ""At the time, Lincoln had an arrangement with the government,"" says Casey, ""where the company would provide these vehicles to the White House for a nominal lease fee, to be used as parade vehicles, and then the Secret Service would have them customized."" The JFK limo was assembled at the Lincoln plant in Wixom, Michigan, in January of 1961. Then, an Ohio customizing house, Hess and Eisenhardt, modified it by literally cutting it in half, extending it by three-and-a-half feet, re-assembling it, and reinforcing the middle section where that extra sheet metal had been added. The Ohio company made the other modifications, as well. ""That's really it?"" If that Continental would have gone to a dealership after it rolled off the line, it would have retailed for $7,347, according to the museum. The customization cost almost $200,000 on top of that. ""People will come in, look at it, do a double-take, and ask, 'That's really it? The car Kennedy was shot in?' Then they'll remark that ""it doesn't look like it did that day in Dallas,'"" Casey notes. ""And that's true -- it doesn't. After Kennedy was assassinated, it suddenly became much more important to protect the president than to see the president. That's when they added the permanent, armored steel top, the bulletproof glass and the armored plates on the sides. (And the black paint job.) ""And some visitors, the ones who are old enough to remember that day, do get emotional when they see that vehicle."" But despite the Secret Service's best efforts to protect the commander-in-chief, subsequent presidents still succumbed to the desire to be seen by the people. The trunk lid of the ''61 JFK limo was armored after Lyndon Johnson dented it when he clambered up onto it while campaigning, and Richard Nixon had a hole cut in the roof so he could stand up and wave to crowds, notes Casey. As for the protective features in Obama's presidential limo - and the Secret Service being so mum on the particulars -- Casey remarks: ""I can understand that. They don't want anyone who might want to harm the president to know exactly what its protective capacities are. But you can safely assume it's very heavily armored, and can withstand bombs, rocket-propelled grenades, and has filtering systems to protect the occupants from poison gasses."" And here's another sober reminder that it's not 1963 any more - or even the early '90s: ""The Reagan limo we have on display, when it was retired from the White House fleet in 1992 -- that was the last presidential limousine that ever went back to the manufacturer after being retired,"" says Casey. ""Ever since, the government has retained ownership of the presidential limousines -- because they don't want anyone else to know what kind of armor or other safety technology they've added to them.""","Historians compare Obama to Kennedy, in terms of his charisma and popularity .

"(CNN) -- As a wife and mother to five children, Sally Massagee had always led an active lifestyle. She ran her own successful CPA firm in her hometown of Hendersonville, North Carolina, and loved to cook and play tennis with friends. But in her late 40s, that all changed. Massagee's muscles began growing out of control. ""Everyone assumed that I spent a whole lot of time in the gym,"" she says. ""One doctor said how many hours a day do you spend in the gym?"" But Massagee didn't work out at the gym, nor was she taking steroids. As her muscles continued to grow, they also started to harden like rocks underneath her skin, causing excruciating pain. Long gone were the days of running and playing tennis. Even basic activities like walking and standing soon became unbearable. ""I couldn't reach up to fold over the turtleneck on my sweater,"" she says. ""I couldn't reach my ears to put on earrings."" In 2006, with her family's support, Massagee began to search for help. She headed first to Duke University Medical Center. For two years, she saw doctor after doctor and had test after test, but no one at Duke could figure out what was happening to her body. For Massagee's husband, Buddy, the mystery was bewildering. ""Duke's about as high as it gets on the notches in the Southeast,"" he says. ""And when Duke tells you they don't know what it is and they don't have any more ways or ideas for guessing or testing what it is, it's a scary thing."" After Duke came up empty, Massagee applied to the the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. But they rejected her because she did not have a diagnosis. With her physical capabilities slipping away, Massagee, 53, thought there was nowhere else to turn. ""I felt certain that if there wasn't a diagnosis, I felt that it was pretty certain that it would kill me,"" she says. In 2008, she got a glimmer of hope. She was told about a new program at the National Institutes of Health that takes on the rarest of undiagnosed cases. With a referral from her endocrinologist from Duke, she was accepted into the Undiagnosed Diseases Program. ""There just aren't words for how excited I was,"" Massagee says, ""that there was a hope ... that someone would be able to find out what was wrong. And I remember Buddy saying in the process, if anybody can figure it out, I think these folks can; I think if there's any hope, this is it."" After the work at UDP, Massagee had a long and nerve-wracking wait. Finally, in May last year, she got the call she'd hoped for -- the mystery was solved. In her case, abnormal proteins which normally attack the organs, were attacking her skeletal muscles. Although the mystery was solved, Massagee's story was far from over. Her diagnosis gave her hope that she'd survive. It also meant enduring a grueling new chapter of her life with no guarantees how that would end. Watch Anderson Cooper . 360° weeknights 8pm ET.

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Relatives divided since 1953 reunited for the first time Saturday at a South Korean-built tourism resort in North Korea amid tensions between the two sides. Elderly men in suits and women in traditional Korean silk hanbok dresses sat at numbered tables in a large restaurant, . Many burst into tears; some sat, spoke and exchanged photographs; others simply looked bewildered as they clutched hands and stared into faces unseen for six decades. The relatives have been separated from since the 1950-53 Korean War. In Seoul, the scenes at a tourism resort at Mount Kumgang played on TV at a press room. ""We have held a memorial service for you every year,"" South Korean Yi Jong-sool told his North Korean elder brother, Yi Jong-ryeol, 90. ""I can't believe you are alive."" The oldest of the South Koreans, Kim Lye-jong, 96, bear-hugged her North Korean daughter, Woo Jong-hye, 71. Goh Yoon-sob, 81, from North Korea met his son Koh Bae-il, 63, from the South; the two were separated when the son was three years old. The men clutched hands and exchanged photographs. The son appeared speechless as his father spoke to him. ""Our mother was waiting for you, but she died last year,"" South Korean Yi Yun told his older brother Yi Hwa-chun, 81. ""If only she had lived one more year ..."" Kang Kyung-won, 79, from North Korea sat across from his younger sister Kang Byong-sun from the South. She dabbed her eyes with a handkerchief unable to speak. There were some remarkable stories. Four South Korean soldiers, initially believed killed in action in North Korea, were alive. They met their family members from the South. Some 436 South Koreans, ranging in age from 12 to 96, met 97 family members from North Korea. But some planned reunions did not go ahead; some relatives had died in the past few days, while others were too ill or fragile to attend. The meetings, which stretch over three days, will be bittersweet; the chances of any of the divided family members meeting again are slim. The tragedy of the divided families dates to the 1950-1953 Korean War, when the Cold War's division of the peninsula into two nations became permanent. Amid fighting, millions of Koreans became refugees -- either fleeing the violence or fearing political reprisals from one side or the other. In winter of 1950, an estimated 650,000 refugees fled North Korea when United Nations forces retreated in the face of a surprise Chinese offensive. There is no direct telephone or mail contact between the two Koreas, but some families in the South have managed to broker surreptitious voice and written contact with their relatives in the North in recent years, as North Korea's border with China has become more permeable and illegal cell phones have penetrated the insulated state. Some 80,000 South Koreans have registered with their government to join one of the infrequent reunions, but 40,000 people are believed to have passed away or given up hope, according to the South's Ministry of Unification. Numbers north of the Korean demilitarized zone are unknown. The first family reunions took place following a landmark summit between the two Koreas in 2000. Since then, 17,100 people representing 3,500 families have been reunited on 17 separate occasions. Seoul has been keen to make the reunions a regular event. But in recent talks on the matter, the North has demanded 500,000 metric tons of rice and 300,000 metric tons of fertilizer to make the meetings a monthly event. The event comes amid tense inter-Korean relations. The North continues to deny any involvement in the sinking of a South Korean warship in March that killed 26 sailors. Seoul, citing an international investigation, accuses Pyongyang of a torpedo attack. On Friday, the day before the reunions were due to begin, North Korean troops fired two bullets at a South Korean guard post. Southern soldiers returned three rounds, and are demanding an explanation via the United Nations' Military Armistice Commission. But the incident has not affected the reunions.","S. Korean to N.

"(CNN) -- If Friday was a day to forget, Tuesday was one to remember. Students, faculty, staff and loved ones did just that at Harder Stadium on the campus of University of California, Santa Barbara, reflecting on the lives of six of its students. ""There is a human desire to come together, to reach out to one another for love and for support,"" University of California President Janet Napolitano told the roughly 20,000 people packed in the stadium, according to campus police. ""We are here because we want to share memories of the young lives struck down far too soon."" Napolitano was one of several speakers at the event late Tuesday afternoon, capping a formal day of mourning on campus. Some represented the Southern California university, others spoke for religious centers based nearby, and then there was the father of one victim who spoke for his family and two others. While two families offered prayers for their sons' killer, there was only one brief mention -- by a faculty member -- of Elliot Rodger by name. He is the only one of the seven killed who didn't attend UCSB. In a 137-page document, not to mention videos and musings on social media, the 22-year-old hinted that years of rejection and jealousy led him to lash out against beautiful women and popular men. Relatives of those Rodger killed described their loved ones as caring, generous and kind. They wanted Tuesday to be about the goodness the victims represented, not the venom connected to their demise. As the family of Cheng Yuan Hong intoned: ""May we together create a peaceful world and let hatred be gone with the wind."" From stabbings to shootings . The 20-year-old Hong was one of Rodger's roommates and first three victims -- along with 19-year-old George Chen and 20-year--old Weihan ""David"" Wang. Each was stabbed to death. A friend of Rodger's family said Rodger recently had a feud with his roommates, complaining to his landlord that they were too noisy and played lots of video games. He hinted at his plans for them in his manifesto, writing in apparent reference to Chen and Hong, ""I'd even enjoy stabbing them both to death while they slept."" But Rodger didn't stop there. He then embarked on a shooting rampage Friday night, killing two young women -- Katherine Cooper, 22, and Veronika Weiss, both members of the Delta Delta Delta sorority. Bob Weiss recalled tracking his 19-year-old daughter's iPhone, noticing that it was moving -- perhaps to the morgue, along with her body -- though no one was answering. The irony, Weiss said, is that Veronika was exactly the kind of person who would want to help Rodger. ""She was kind. She was the person who would reach out to the kids who weren't the popular kids, some of the nerdy kids, some of the kids that were a little bit like this Rodger kid described himself as."" Rodger didn't stop there, either. He went into a deli and killed UCSB junior Christopher Martinez, who was getting a sandwich. There was more chaos and violence that followed. But while 13 people overall suffered injuries, the only other person who'd die that night was Rodger himself. He was found with a gunshot wound to his head, after crashing his black BMW. By then, Rodger's mother, Lichin, had seen the e-mailed manifesto as well as disturbing video on his YouTube page in which her son talked about ""slaughtering"" women at a sorority house at UCSB, family friend Simon Astaire said. She and her ex-husband set off from Los Angeles to Santa Barbara, at which point they learned of a shooting. Later, they learned that their son -- who had a history of mental health issues, and was seeing at least two therapists -- was the one behind it. Killer's parents frantically searched for son . Inside the gunman's head: Rejection, jealousy and a vow to kill 'beautiful girls' Victim's father: 'It's intolerable' As he has been ever since his emotional and overtly political speech hours after his son's killing, Martinez's father, Richard, was the most visible and vocal of the victim's family members at Tuesday's memorial. He began his remarks by reading statements on behalf of the Hong and Wang families. The latter expressed pride in a son they characterized as gentle, kind, loving, peaceful and thankful. ""Good for now,"" the Wang family wrote, ""until we see you in heaven."" Then, Richard Martinez spoke for his own family (even as he stressed, his views aren't those of all the victims' families). He began by remembering his son as a sweet, if determined young man, someone who would quickly get back up if he was knocked down. Richard Martinez said that his son's death should not be in vain, imploring people and especially politicians to enact stricter gun control laws. He recalling telling a member of Congress that their condolences wouldn't help; he wanted them to make a difference with policy changes so that there wouldn't be more parents, like himself, grieving the loss of children to senseless acts of violence. He rallied many in attendance Tuesday to stand up and chant ""not one more"" -- the words he had used when addressing reporters shortly after his son's death Friday. ""It's intolerable,"" Richard Martinez said Friday. ""We know what's happening here. Too many people have died, and it should be not one more."" Father of shooting victim chastises politicians .

"(CNN) -- Dr. Jack Kevorkian, the Michigan pathologist who put assisted suicide on the world's medical ethics stage, died early Friday, according to a spokesman with Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Michigan. He was 83. The assisted-suicide advocate had been hospitalized for pneumonia and a kidney-related ailment, his attorney had said. He had struggled with kidney problems for years and had checked into a hospital earlier this month for similar problems, his lawyer, Mayer Morganroth, said. He checked back into the hospital in the Detroit suburb on May 18 after suffering a relapse, Morganroth said. Kevorkian, dubbed ""Dr. Death,"" made national headlines as a supporter of physician-assisted suicide and ""right-to-die"" legislation. He was charged with murder numerous times through the 1990s for helping terminally ill patients take their own lives. He was convicted on second-degree murder charges in 1999 stemming from the death of a patient who suffered from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, commonly called Lou Gehrig's disease. He was paroled in 2007. After his release, he said he would not help end any more lives. Morganroth told CNN Friday that he was summoned to the hospital Thursday night, with doctors telling him ""the end was near"" for Kevorkian. 1998 video sparked criminal case against Kevorkian . ""The doctors and nurses were extremely supportive,"" Morganroth said. They played music by Kevorkian's favorite composer -- Bach -- in his room, and Kevorkian died about 2:30 a.m., Morganroth said. Attorney Geoffrey Fieger, who was Kervorkian's lawyer on several assisted-suicide cases, described Kevorkian as a ""historic man."" ""He simply felt that it was the duty of every physician to alleviate suffering, and when the circumstance was such that there was no alternative, to help that patient to end their own suffering,"" Fieger said in a statement. In an interview with CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta last year, Kevorkian said he had no regrets about his work. ""No, no. It's your purpose (as a) physician.

In that interview, Kevorkian said that he had three missions in life and that he himself was not ready to die. One of his missions was to warn mankind of ""impending doom"" that will come from the culture of overabundance. ""I'm not going to be too popular for that one,"" he said. His second mission was to educate people about assisted suicide, and his belief that in states where assisted suicide has been legalized, it is not being done right. He believed that people shouldn't have to have a terminal condition in order to qualify for help in ending their own lives. Kevorkian's third stated mission was to convince Americans that their rights are being infringed upon by bans on everything from smoking to assisted suicide. In 2008, at the age of 80, he failed in a run for Congress in Michigan.

"Concord, Michigan (CNN) -- The drive leading to Ted Nugent's house is lush with trees and water, and marked with the occasional yellow sign. ""Lab Xing,"" one warns, showing the silhouette of a dog. Another urges visitors to drive slowly: ""Don't hurt my critters."" This from the ""Motor City Madman,"" a rocker famous for decades of thrashing guitars with ""10 digits of rhythm and blues doom,"" a hunter and reality show star known for killing whatever game he spots, and an outspoken conservative whose fiery talk has earned him a visit from the U.S. Secret Service. It's a mild summer afternoon, and he's just back home from a show that kept him up until 3 a.m. He's a little tired and the water by the dock is calm. Gonzo, Nugent's hunting dog, is blissfully rolling in the dirt at his feet. ""Did you feel your soul being cleansed, just on the driveway?"" Nugent demands. ""Was it beautiful, or what?"" He's not really looking for an answer. He just likes to talk about this patch of wetland, a fen he says provides for oodles of frogs, deer and the rare Mitchell's Satyr butterfly. ""This is a piece of private ground that is thriving biodiversity,"" he says. ""I couldn't be more proud."" So this is Ted Nugent offstage, Ted at age 63. The Michigan native is still excitable, opinionated and loud, especially since his hearing isn't so great these days. He punctuates almost every rant and declaration by shouting ""Are you kidding me?!"" or ""Aren't I adorable?!"" But he says this place gives him balance. He can riff about music with his band members, spend time with his wife, Shemane, or dole out belly rubs to the dogs. (There are three: Aging Thunder is a little creaky and just barely tolerating the bouncy, spotlight-stealing puppy, Rocky. Gonzo is the ""the wonder Lab, the master hunter,"" a retriever who'd bring back any rabbit, possum or woodchuck. ""He's a good dog and he loves his daddy,"" Nugent says.) Most likely, this is the place Nugent would climb into a deer blind and sit silently for hours, thinking about everything or nothing. ""I want to play music during the spring and summer, but then I want to go hunting every fall and winter,"" he says. The music is ""so intense. It's so draining, you push yourself such outrageous, animal limits. In order to maintain that intensity, I have to get away from it."" Getting away means spending time on his land in Texas or in ""my swamps"" right here. They'll dine tonight in the log cabin house a short walk from the dock, probably on something he shot with a bow and arrow. Nugent says he doesn't do anything fancy for those meals -- he doesn't want to tarnish what nature provided -- but they'll sometimes use a marinade of garlic, pepper, olive oil and Vernor's, Michigan's beloved, peppery ginger ale. ""Here is the beauty of my perfect life: me, my dogs, my family, all of them, my band, my crew, my drivers, my pilot, my guys, my outfitters, my frogs, my production team, everybody. Meet anybody in Ted Nugent's life? Kickin' ass. ""Everybody in my world is good."" Watch Nugent tell Piers Morgan what's wrong with America . While he believes everyone in his life is good, and he is always right, he's willing to say that wasn't always true. He does have some regrets. He didn't go to legendary hunter Fred Bear's birthday party. Thought he was too busy. That was a mistake. ""I Love You So I Told You A Lie."" Maybe you've heard the song? Never should've been recorded. He shouldn't have exploded during a CBS interview earlier this year, when he used some language he won't repeat now. During the interview, he lashed out at the notion he's extreme, directing some of his bleeped-out response at an off-camera producer. Nugent says he was passing a kidney stone at the time and taking pain relievers -- ""thought I was giving birth to a hedgehog."" He regrets that he ""went into this disgusting street rant"" instead of keeping control. (A few weeks earlier, Nugent stirred controversy by saying he'd be ""dead or in jail"" if Barack Obama was re-elected. The Secret Service was concerned enough to stop by and the Army canceled his Fort Knox show. He didn't list it among his regrets.) And there's this: He loved his dad for the discipline, but Ma Nuge, he says, made him everything he is. Marion Dorothy Nugent was buoyant and loud and excitable, and she supported him from the moment he bought that big blond Epiphone, his first guitar. He didn't go to her funeral. ""I loved my mom so dearly. But I rationalized. I was with her throughout her illness. I was not a funeral guy....it was always so ritualistic. I didn't feel that was the relationship,"" he says. ""I didn't understand funerals. I plead ignorant. And I apologize."" After she died in 1989, he buried her remains here in his Michigan swamps, he says. ""It was a solemn experience,"" he says. ""The breeze is picking up. Mom's talking to us right now."" He still doesn't see his family -- his grandkids -- as much as he'd like. Nugent will catch a few days with them during his tour, or when he heads back to Texas. They call him Poppy, he says, and they will wrestle and play as much as his knees (and his children, their parents) allow. ""I've been blamed by my children that I make it more difficult to put (the grandkids) to bedtime, because I get them more wired,"" Nugent says. ""But after all, I did write 'Wango Tango.' We may as well dance.""","At 63, rocker Ted Nugent is still playing music, with no plans to stop .

"(MNN.com) -- Gwen Sparling and her husband were heading out of town when their cat developed a urinary tract infection that required antibiotics. Their frisky and outgoing feline spent that vacation stuck at a veterinary clinic, leaving Sparling wracked with guilt — and an idea to help other cat lovers. ""I felt awful that she was in this tiny box designed for cats that are ill,"" says Sparling, who opened a cats-only boarding facility called Camp Kitty two years ago in Scottdale, Georgia. ""My dogs had so many options and my cats didn't."" Business was sluggish during the first few months, but now cabins at Camp Kitty welcome a steady stream of felines, including her own. With pet spending on the rise, fueled by growth in the service sector, more businesses are realizing that cat owners have needs, too. PetsHotel, a division of the PetSmart chain, offers overnight care, and a handful of boutique facilities across the country provide discriminating cats with amenities such as private jungle gyms and special treats each night. Prices range from $18 for a night in Camp Kitty's standard cabin to more than $50 for a 6-foot-by-6-foot ""Palazzo"" at Feline Wishes and Caviar Dreams in San Francisco. If you are planning a trip out of town and need to find boarding options for a particularly finicky or special needs cat, start looking for options now. Sparling says that holiday space goes quickly. Here are a few more insider tips you need to know about cat boarding facilities before scheduling your pet's vacation. Cats prefer a calm, quiet atmosphere . While the third franchise of high-end D Pet Hotels in New York will feature 10,000 square feet of play space for pampered pooches, along with queen-sized beds, 42-inch flat screen TVs and a pint-sized treadmill for dogs to burn excess energy, Sparling says cats don't require all those bells and whistles. Many actually tend to get anxious in new environments, which can trigger health issues. To keep things calm and establish a regular routine for her four-legged clients, Sparling limits the number of employees who interact with feline guests. She also carefully monitors food intake during the first 24 to 48 hours to ensure that stress isn't getting the best of her clients. MNN.com: Lolcats: Where they came from and why we love them . Most cats do not want to mingle . Dog daycares and boarding facilities allow pups to frolic in open areas, but Sparling says mixing clients could be catastrophic. Multiple cats from one household may tolerate boarding together, but most cats prefer quiet time alone in cabins outfitted with toys and bedding. ""Cats aren't little dogs — they are completely different,"" she says. ""Cats are more up-front with their body language and saying 'do not cross this line.'"" Sparling says that being high up helps cats feel a bit safer in unfamiliar surroundings. With that in mind, most cabins are built with an emphasis on vertical space in the form of of high perches. Plan to share detailed health info — and your vet's phone number . Ask prospective cat boarders how they handle emergency health issues and provide contact information for your cat's veterinarian. Most reputable facilities have a doctor or veterinary technician on call, but Sparling says that reaching your cat's vet can save valuable time. It also helps to alert your veterinarian about the cat's mini vacation, just in case. ""I always call the cat's vet first if there is an issue,"" she says. ""The vet has the cat's records and knows all about the cat."" MNN.com: Common health issues in older cats . If your cat is under the weather during its stay, many facilities also will administer medication for an additional fee that ranges from $10 to $15. Be sure to list detailed info regarding medication times and dosages. Make sure vaccinations are up to date . Even though most cats occupy individual cabins, vaccinations are required at most reputable facilities. Sparling requests proof of vaccination for rabies and distemper prior to the cat's visit. Ask for referrals, and schedule time to check out facilities . Since the business of cat boarding is still relatively new, there are no professional associations guiding the practice. To find a reputable facility in your area, seek referrals from cat-loving friends or call your veterinarian. Also, make time to check out facilities before scheduling your cat's visit. ""Watch the staff and how they interact with cats currently in boarding,"" Sparling says. ""See the current boarders. Are they stressed out?"" MNN.com: How do I find a place to board my pet? Since some boarding facilities handle cats and dogs, carefully observe the intake process, especially if your cat has spent little or no time around dogs. Even if it's not required, make sure your pet arrives in a travel carrier to avoid any issues during check-in. Prepare to bribe your cat for the time away . Even with the most gregarious cat, boarding can be stressful. Take time to prepare your feline for time away from home by practicing the process of entering and exiting its travel carrier. In a previous column, pet expert Victoria Stilwell offers tips to make traveling to the vet with cats less stressful for people and pets. Once your beloved feline returns to the castle, prepare for days — and possibly weeks — of bribery to get back on its good side. © Copyright 2011 Mother Nature Network .","Camp Kitty owner: My dogs had more options than my cats .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Mason Jennings is free of drugs or alcohol. Has been for some time now. But danger still lurks in his music. Rolling Stone recently dubbed Mason Jennings ""one of the best songwriters you've never heard of."" Effortless melody, dexterous wordplay, tight compositions -- they come easy for Jennings, whom Rolling Stone recently dubbed ""one of the best songwriters you've never heard of."" But his new album, ""Blood of Man"" (Brushfire), goes deeper than his previous work, which presented a more affable side of the Honolulu-born, Minneapolis-based singer-songwriter. At a recent show in Los Angeles, Jennings told the crowd that he had to tell his mother about a couple of songs on ""Blood of Man."" ""There might be some painful memories in there,"" he warned. His mother responded, ""Well, I'll be writing a song called 'My Son Stole My Car and Got Stoned and Drunk.' "" ""Blood of Man"" is raw and personal, Jennings allowed in an interview. ""I got to a place where I made music that moved me,"" he said. ""When I play with that kind of openness ... I know I can get free.""  Watch a music video of Mason Jennings » . ""I think it has to do with wanting transcendence,"" he said at another point. ""Everybody is looking for a feeling of release, and my release comes through my music."" CNN sat down with Mason Jennings in a Los Angeles recording studio. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: This record is getting the best reviews of your career. Reaction? Mason Jennings: It's surprising. [For] this one, I didn't even think about other people. What would I like to do? If no one is going to hear this, what would it sound like? So I was just recording tons of songs in the winter by myself, and I ended up putting out what I had done. I thought there would be no reviews or people would just ignore it. So it's great to have this kind of reaction [to the album]. CNN: The title ""Blood of Man"" can mean many things ... Jennings: I was actually a little embarrassed by it. Kind of intense and pretty dark, but in the end, there was no other option. To me, it's about humanness -- dark and light -- instinctual humanness. There's just life blood coming through it. CNN: You mentioned darkness. On the album, we have ""black wind blowing"" and ""lonely roads"" and ""suicide halls."" Are you speaking from personal experience? Jennings: [It was] letting myself feel anger, desire, fear ... all those human things inside you. Trusting that it's OK to put them out there. Trusting more about what resonates with me rather than trying to steer the songs to safer waters. CNN: Were there parts of yourself that you hadn't really mined to this point? Jennings: Yes. The song ""Pittsburgh"" draws from experiences I had growing up that triggered a lot of different things. It's a rough period for everybody, but I had a lot of different experiences that were kind of ... difficult. I started writing about those, and it started feeling more like a diary or my own expression [as opposed to] some of my other stuff where I tend to be more ""in character."" CNN: How did your newfound practice of meditation affect ""Blood of Man""? Jennings: I would think that if you go that inward that even more demons would come up, but it was the opposite. I started doing a lot of yoga, pretty intensely, right when I started recording these songs. So I have a feeling that it was a big part of getting into my body -- getting physical and connecting with my spirit and allowing me to get free. It was a big part of this record, strangely, because [the record] is so dark and raw, but the whole time I [knew] I could handle it. CNN: The song ""Blood of Man"" seems like a centerpiece. Jennings: When I was doing these recordings, I was sending them to a couple of producers to see what they thought of the ideas. Most of the time they were asking me how I recorded this or that and how I got [certain sounds]. I thought ""Maybe this is OK just how it is."" I didn't have that one final song that tied it all together, and I was so excited about the idea that I was going to release everything [as is] and that song just came to me and really hit me hard. It's one of my favorite songs. That song feels like something I've been trying to do for years. It captures the feeling I had the whole time I was writing this album. CNN: I could see where a producer would take these songs and add strings, make it gloss, but it works the way it is. Jennings: A lot of people want to clean up my sound. They want to take the rough edges off, and whenever I've tried that -- to hear my voice in that context ... it doesn't sound good. It sounds out of place, like having a barn animal walk into a fancy room. Whenever I try to work too hard on [a song] and force it...it doesn't [sound right]. But then I write a song like ""City of Ghosts,"" and it's like a punch. It's [quick], and it's done. CNN: It can't be calculated. Jennings: Got have to that tape rolling. And the other thing is [to] make sure you stay inspired by life. Keep that sense of wonder.","Mason Jennings' new CD, ""Blood of Man,"" is very personal .

"Mexico City (CNN) -- Hours after Mexico's presumed president-elect, Enrique Peña Nieto, said it was time for his country to leave behind the political rancor of campaign season, his closest opponent in the polls refused to concede and said the vote had been ""plagued by irregularities."" Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who election authorities projected as the runner-up in Sunday's presidential vote, said Monday that he was awaiting the official election results, and prepared to contest them before judicial authorities if they didn't turn out in his favor. ""The election was plagued by irregularities before, during and after the process,"" said Lopez Obrador. The Democratic Revolution Party candidate's declarations echoed comments he made in 2006, when election authorities said the leftist candidate narrowly lost the presidential race to Felipe Calderon. Lopez Obrador claimed election fraud and never conceded, referring to himself afterward as ""the legitimate president of Mexico."" His supporters protested nationwide. In Mexico City, they staged sit-ins and blockades. On Monday, Lopez Obrador called on his supporters to wait for the official results. The Federal Election Institute's verification of individual poll results begins Wednesday. Earlier, Peña Nieto, who election authorities projected as the winner of Sunday's presidential vote, told CNN en Español he was ready to work across party lines to build a better Mexico. ""We have to be constructive and put aside our differences, which are only for competitions and electoral contests,"" Peña Nieto said Monday. ""Yesterday I indicated that (after) this tense and divisive atmosphere, which is natural in all democratic contests, we have to turn the page and move on to enter another chapter, another moment in our political lives, with a willingness and spirit that are constructive and purposeful."" A quick count based on samples from polling stations throughout the country gave Peña Nieto the lead, with between 37.93% and 38.55% of votes, the Federal Election Institute said late Sunday night. On Monday, the presumed president-elect said he had been receiving congratulatory phone calls and messages from world leaders, including U.S. President Barack Obama. Peña Nieto said he was unfazed by the fact that more than 50% of Mexicans had not voted for him. ""We, fortunately, live in democratic conditions with three predominant political forces, and this makes it very hard for any party to have an absolute majority,"" he told CNN en Español. The projected victory for Peña Nieto marks a triumphant return to power for the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which lost its grip on Mexico's presidency to the conservative National Action Party in 2000. Peña Nieto profile . The Federal Election Institute's projections raised two key questions rooted in Mexico's complicated political past: Has the PRI, a political party that critics accuse of being authoritarian and corrupt, changed its approach? And will supporters of Lopez Obrador protest election results as they have in the past? U.S.-Mexico relationship . Peña Nieto said Sunday night that he was looking forward, not back. ""We are a new generation. There is no return to the past. My government will have its vision based in the future,"" he told reporters. On the local level, there may not be many differences between today's PRI and the political party that dominated Mexico for decades, said Andrew Selee, director of the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. ""What's changed on the national stage is that Mexican citizens have different expectations for their federal government that are going to force the PRI to govern in a different way than it did 20 years ago,"" he said. For much of the PRI's rule, the political party controlled not only the presidency, but also national and state legislatures and local governments across the country. Now, in the country's Senate, a preliminary tally Monday showed the PRI winning only 33 of 128 seats. In the House of Representatives, the PRI had secured more seats than any other party, according to the preliminary tally. But opposition parties combined held a majority of seats. ""Then, the PRI was really a party that included all of Mexico, that had a broad patronage network and tolerated little dissent outside of the party,"" Selee said. ""And the PRI today is going to have to deal with opposition parties that have tasted power, an active citizenry that expects to be involved in major policies decisions, and a very vigilant press that will report on everything that happens."" Weeks before Sunday's vote, criticisms of Peña Nieto and concerns about the PRI's possible return to power fueled a student movement that has staged demonstrations throughout the country. On Monday, outraged students from the group marched in Mexico City. They carried signs that said, ""Mexico without PRI"" and ""Mexico voted, and Peña did not win."" But while critics slam Peña Nieto, the charismatic 45-year-old former governor galvanized fervent support among residents of his home state and party loyalists nationwide. 8 things U.S. could learn from Mexico . The Consulta Mitofsky, GEA/ISA and Parametria firms said their exit poll results projected a win for Peña Nieto, with more than 40% of voters saying they cast ballots for the PRI candidate. Peña Nieto's campaign platform included plans to stop the rise in food prices, promote energy reform, give social security to all Mexicans and reduce violence nationwide. ""He is obviously prepared. There was obviously a dirty war against him,"" said Martha Rojas Ramos, 58, as she prepared to cast a ballot for Peña Nieto at a Mexico City elementary school on Sunday. Critics lamenting the possible return of the PRI to power aren't thinking straight, she said. ""That's all in the past,"" Rojas said. ""What's important is that he is young and has all the ability to represent us."" CNN's Mario Gonzalez, Rafael Romo, Miguel Marquez, Krupskaia Alis, Ariel Crespo, Rey Rodriguez, Rene Hernandez and CNNMexico.com's Tania L. Montalvo and Arturo Ascención contributed to this report.","NEW: Peña Nieto says he has received congratulatory messages from world leaders .

"Washington (CNN) -- Less than two weeks remain before the March 31 deadline to apply for the Affordable Care Act and the Obama administration is getting creative in reminding Americans to sign up by trying to reach every demographic imaginable. The administration this month is deploying quirky stunts and niche messaging to reach as many people as possible, including those ""young invincibles"" considered essential to making the program work economically. So far, the administration says it has signed up 5 million people. Here's what it's doing to boost the rolls between now and the end of the month when those who don't have insurance of any kind would face a fine of $95 or 1% of their income, whichever is higher. College basketball fans: As NCAA ""March Madness"" kicks into high gear this week, the White House unveiled its own spin on the popular basketball tournament bracket by unveiling the ACA bracket where people can vote on the ""16 sweetest reasons to get covered."" Get it? A play on the NCAA tournament ""Sweet 16."" A video of University of North Carolina men's basketball coach Roy Williams and University of Connecticut women's coach Geno Auriemma lead off the ACA bracket with a video encouraging people to sign up. On the online bracket are 16 reasons with corresponding light-hearted GIFs. For example, the reasons ""women can't be charged more than men"" is combined with a GIF of first lady Michelle Obama slam dunking on NBA players. That's paired with the ""accidents happen,"" with a GIF of a woman dressed in spandex and a headband, dancing ridiculously then slipping off a public bathroom countertop. Cat fans: Included on the page are GIFs of scary cats, adorable cats and random cats. There's also a random electronic Elmo that throws itself off the shelf because ""nobody's invincible."" More college hoops: The administration sees a lot of opportunity with the NCAA tourney as much of its final outreach is dedicated to the popular sporting event that concludes in early April. The White House is also attempting to parlay the popularity of the President's annual basketball bracket -- a recent tradition that registered the most views of any blog on WhiteHouse.gov during 2013 -- into tangible enrollments by updating the results of the ACA bracket based on the ""winning"" votes from online users. In an effort to reach ""tournament fans young and old,"" the Department of Health and Human Services unveiled a report Tuesday about the frequency and cost of recreational sports injuries. In a blog post, Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius wrote that ""a sprained ankle, for example, can cost you $2,290, and charges for a broken arm, for example, average nearly $7,700."" Young YouTube fans: The bracket-mania is fresh off the heels of Obama's recent foray into viral video comedy. Last week, Obama was a guest on Zach Galifianakis' ""Funny or Die"" Web series ""Between Two Ferns"" where the President touted the Affordable Care Act and the ways to sign up. And carried on the series schtick of insulting the host. Galifianakis asks Obama if he wished he could run for a third term, Obama replied that two terms are enough -- like two of the host's ""Hangover"" movies probably would have been enough. After Obama asked Galifinakis if he's heard of the Affordable Care Act, Galifinakis responded, ""Oh yeah, I heard about that. That's the thing that doesn't work."" ""The Affordable Care Act works great now,"" Obama retorted. Then in a radio interview with Hollywood media mogul, Ryan Seacrest, Obama said that his ""Between Two Ferns"" skit was a success. ""The amazing thing was afterwards people actually did link to healthcare.gov and people actually signed up for health insurance,"" Obama told Seacrest. What we learned from Florida's special election . Pro basketball fans: The administration is betting that sports is an effective way to reach people who might not normally pay attention to politics or the machinations that happen in Washington. LeBron James, the Miami Heat star and reigning back-to-back NBA Most Valuable Player, cut a 30-second public service announcement for the administration that will air widely on ESPN, ABC, TNT and NBAtv. ""You never know when you might take a hit,"" James says in the TV spot. The White House is also coordinating with Gameplan4me.com, a website where sports stars talk about how they achieved their goals. On the home page of the site is the usual banner question, ""What's your Game Plan?"" followed by the subheading, ""Did you know that 48 million Americans are without a health insurance plan and one accident away from the costly expenses of not being covered?"" ""Watch videos from sports and entertainment professionals, play games, learn how to be ready for the unexpected and find useful links to information on health care options,"" the site's home page says. Hispanic sports fans: To appeal to the Hispanic sports enthusiast, ESPN Deportes network will air an interview with White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, who's already given interviews to sports talk radio stations to help pitch enrolling in the federal health care exchange, on its syndicated network of stations. Scholars and researchers: The White House recently launched a campaign, #GeeksGetCovered, to reach ""entrepreneurs, researchers, and graduate and postdoctoral students."" Women, especially moms: Obama participated in a recent interview with WebMD, which the White House said ""has enormous reach with moms and women,"" where he promoted the ACA. And a Web video with the first lady and mothers of celebrities Jonah Hill, Adam Levine, Jennifer Lopez, and Alicia Keys encouraged young people to sign up. The states: Rhode Island is taking a unique approach to get young people signed up for health care: teaching moms how to use social media apps like Tinder and Twitter to nag their kids. The website, called ""Nag Toolkit,"" offers step-by-step, illustrated instructions on how to sign up for various apps or dating websites, like SnapChat, Tinder, Twitter and OkCupid. The site was launched last week by HealthSourceRI, the state exchange's site, Dara Chadwick, HealthSourceRI's chief of strategic communications and media relations, replied in an email. Tinder is a popular dating app in which users swipe left or right â€” ""nope"" or ""liked"" â€” on potential dates, based on Facebook-linked pictures. The Nag Toolkit site teaches parents how to sign up for Tinder, instructing them to ""add a FaceBook profile photo with a sign saying 'get health insurance' "" so Tinder will use it as its main image. The website also instructs parents to ""create a provocative username"" on another dating app, OkCupid, and then search their son or daughter to send them messages about health insurance. Chadwick calls the effort ""a light-hearted campaign with a serious mission,"" and adds that its target are 23- to 33-year-old Rhode Islanders as well as moms ages 45 and up. Despite critics, Chadwick takes it in stride. ""As for criticism, that's the way it goes with any advertising campaign,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- The Navajo Nation will mark history Friday when it officially announces a $554 million settlement from the U.S. government, putting an end to years of litigation. The landmark agreement stems from a 2006 lawsuit in which the nation says the U.S. mismanaged trust fund assets dating back to 1946. ""It's monumental. This is the largest trust responsibility award from the United States in the history of Indian country. It will never completely redress the wrongs done to prior generations, but it's going to allow some opportunities for future generations,"" said Dana Bobroff, deputy attorney general for the nation. In May, an agreement was reached between members of the Navajo Nation, the U.S. Interior and Justice departments and the Bureau of Indian Affairs and will be sealed with a signing ceremony Friday at Window Rock Tribal Park in Arizona.

Acting U.S. Assistant Attorney General Sam Hirsch, who will attend Friday's ceremony, said President Obama has long worked to strengthen ties between the United States and the Navajo Nation, adding that ""it reflects my personal commitment to resolving long-standing lawsuits rather than wasting the time and resources of both the United States and Indian tribes in contentious litigation."" According to the Department of Justice, the U.S. settled with 41 tribes for about $1 billion in April 2012. Since then, the government has focused on resolving other trust accounting and mismanagement cases. Photographer shows what Native Americans really look like .

"San Diego (CNN) -- Now that President Barack Obama has broken his promise to take executive action on immigration, and put off the thorny issue until after the midterm elections -- and I predict, for the remainder of his presidency -- many immigration reform advocates are angry, surprised and disappointed. I'm none of those things. Here's my take: When it comes to Obama and immigration, keep your expectations low. Despite what he says, don't make the mistake of thinking that he actually supports legalizing the undocumented. Finally, whatever he says, don't assume it's the truth. When it comes to immigration, Obama has a long trail of half-truths and broken promises. In July 2008, the presidential candidate told the National Council of La Raza that, if elected, he would make the issue a top priority and address it within the first 100 days. That didn't happen. White House officials then moved the goal line to, well, the first term. That didn't happen either. From 2009 to 2011, Obama told supporters that he couldn't curb deportations because he was ""not a king."" Yet, in 2012, eager to re-engage Hispanic voters for his reelection, Obama summoned his inner monarch when he unveiled ""Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals,"" which gives undocumented young people a temporary reprieve from deportation and work permits. In 2013, Obama did another about-face and returned to his rhetoric about how he couldn't act alone to stop deportations. He also gave half-hearted support to the Senate immigration bill, which would militarize the border and only legalize about half of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States. Now, we're in another election year, and Obama is back to cynically using the promise of immigration reform to get Latino voters to turn out. He dangles it like a carrot in front of a donkey pulling a cart. Speaking in the Rose Garden on June 30, Obama bemoaned inaction by the Republican-controlled House and promised to take executive action before the end of summer. Lawmakers urge Obama to work with Congress on immigration . Well, summer is over, and Obama is backing out of the deal. Some on the left are finally getting the message that Obama is not their amigo. Cristina Jimenez, the managing director for United We Dream, an advocacy group for undocumented students, told The New York Times: ""The president's latest broken promise is another slap to the face of the Latino and immigrant community."" For Obama, the question is never what he can do for the immigration issue but what the immigration issue can do for him. It's no surprise that some on the left have realized that they have to do for themselves. Just a few hours before Obama's retreat, I was having breakfast in Southern California with one of the leaders of a prominent grassroots immigrant rights organization. He wanted me to connect his group with Republicans who support immigration reform because it might pressure Obama to act. I can do one better. Want to get comprehensive immigration reform? Elect a Republican president. Congress passes laws, but the president sets priorities. Just like Obama did with health care reform, which is why we call the new law ""Obamacare"" and not ""Pelosicare"" or ""Reidcare."" Once you see through the political fog on the immigration debate, you realize that Republican presidents are a better bet for delivering reform. Three reasons: . First, ignore what politicians say and watch what they do. Democrats campaign as soft on illegal immigrants, but they're tough on them once in office. Republicans campaign as tough on illegal immigrants, but they're soft on them once in office. Second, look at history. In 1986, it was a Republican president, Ronald Reagan, who signed an ""amnesty"" bill into law. Twenty years later, it was another Republican, George W. Bush, who boldly kicked off the modern debate over comprehensive immigration reform by proposing legal status for the undocumented. Meanwhile, it was a Democrat, Bill Clinton, who militarized the border with Operation Gatekeeper in 1994 and signed a 1996 immigration law that made it easier to deport people and harder to return. Now we have another Democrat, Barack Obama, who has deported more than 2 million people, roped local police into enforcing immigration law through the program known as Secure Communities and shipped thousands of child refugees back to Central America without due process. Third, understand human nature. Republicans don't love immigrants. But they love business, and business loves immigrants. Meanwhile, Democrats don't hate immigrants. But they love unions, and unions hate immigrants. Obama: Waiting will make immigration executive action 'more sustainable' Still, electing the right leaders is only half the job. The rest of it is holding them accountable. Latinos should be furious at Obama's betrayal. But they should save some anger for themselves for believing the lies. As for Obama, he continues to insult Latinos with more blame-shifting and double talk. Now he insists that his decision to delay any executive action on immigration wasn't based on politics -- except when it was. On Sunday, during an appearance on NBC News' ""Meet the Press,"" Obama told moderator Chuck Todd that contrary to earlier reports, he was not trying to help Democrats in Congress keep their seats in November. Instead, he realized that the recent surge of unaccompanied minors across the US-Mexico border changed the political equation. ""The truth of the matter,"" Obama said, ""is that the politics did shift midsummer because of that problem."" To summarize, the president who didn't have enough courage is blaming his ineptitude on child refugees who had an abundance of it. Breaking his promise made the President look dishonest. Admitting that it was about politics made him look weak. But blaming it all on the kids made him look pathetic.","Ruben Navarrette: The delay announced by President Obama is another broken pledge .
He says promises that immigration reform would be a priority were not serious .

'Twin Peaks' returns -- on Showtime . A new ""Twin Peaks"" could be intriguing, since the show was so labyrinthine to start with. Indeed, the Internet erupted with enthusiasm at the news. Other ideas, such as the possibility of a ""Say Anything"" TV series, haven't been so well received. Nowadays, there's no reason that a show has to die completely.

(Besides, as the saying goes, there's nothing new under the sun.) What could these shows be? A long time ago -- back in the '90s and '00s -- there was a program on the now-defunct network Trio called ""Brilliant But Cancelled,"" which was a way to showcase a number of notable network programs that died before their time. It was a chance to look anew at shows such as Larry Gelbart's ""United States,"" the prescient ""Profit"" and the bizarre ""Lookwell,"" starring Adam West and created by Conan O'Brien and Robert Smigel.

We've come up with our own list of TV series that we wouldn't mind seeing get a second shot. With the right brain trust, some of these programs can be better than they were. The best example is probably ""Battlestar Galactica,"" which in its original incarnation was an old-fashioned space opera.

"Washington (CNN) -- Activists in the Tea Party movement tend to be male, rural, upscale, and overwhelmingly conservative, according to a new national poll. A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Wednesday also indicates that Tea Party activists would vote overwhelmingly Republican in a two-party race for Congress. The party's GOP leanings, the poll suggests, may pose a problem for the Tea Party movement if it tries to turn itself into a third party to compete with the two major parties in this year's general election. ""If the Tea Party runs its own candidates for U.S. House, virtually every vote the Tea Party candidate gets would be siphoned from the GOP candidate, potentially allowing the Democrats to win in districts that they might have otherwise lost,"" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. ""While the concept of an independent third party is extremely popular, most Americans, including most Tea Party supporters, don't favor a third party that would result in a winner who disagrees with them on most major issues."" According to the survey, roughly 11 percent of all Americans say they have actively supported the Tea Party movement, either by donating money, attending a rally, or taking some other active step to support the movement. Of this core group of Tea Party activists, 6 of 10 are male and half live in rural areas. Nearly three-quarters of Tea Party activists attended college, compared to 54 percent of all Americans, and more than 3 in 4 call themselves conservatives. ""Keep in mind that this is a pretty small sample of Tea Party activists,"" Holland said. ""But even taking that into account, the demographic gaps that the poll finds between those activists and the general public on gender, education, income, ideology, and voting behavior appear to be significant differences."" The poll indicates that about 24 percent of the public generally favors the Tea Party movement but has not taken any actions such as donating money or attending a rally. Adding in the 11 percent who say they are active, a total of 35 percent could be described as Tea Party supporters. That larger group is also predominantly male, higher-income, and conservative. Some 45 percent of all Americans say they don't know enough about the Tea Party to have a view of the movement; 1 in 5 say they oppose the Tea Party. According to the survey, most Tea Party activists describe themselves as Independents. ""But that's slightly misleading, because 87 percent say they would vote for the GOP candidate in their congressional district if there were no third-party candidate endorsed by the Tea Party,"" Holland said. So what would happen if the Tea Party supported independent candidates for Congress? The poll indicates that in a two-way race on the so-called ""generic ballot"" question, GOP candidates have a 47 percent to 45 percent edge. Throw a Tea Party candidate into the mix, and that two-point advantage becomes a 12-point deficit. That's because virtually everyone who would vote for a Tea Party candidate in a three-way contest would choose a Republican in a two-way race. The Democratic candidate gets 45 percent in both scenarios, but the GOP candidate's share of the vote drops from 47 percent in a two-way contest to just 33 percent with a Tea Party candidate on the ballot. ""Historically, that's the problem many political movements have faced if they try to become a full-fledged party. They often wind up ensuring the victory of the candidate they dislike the most,"" Holland added. See Complete CNN/Opinion Research Poll (PDF) Sixty-four percent of all Americans say they like the idea of a third party that would run against the Democrats and Republicans. But only 38 percent would support a third party if its presence on the ballot would mean that the winning candidate is one that disagrees with them on most major issues. According to the poll, Tea Party activists feel the same way: Only 4 in 10 favor a third party that would result in the election of candidates they don't like. The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll was conducted by telephone February 12-15, with 1,023 adult Americans, including 124 respondents who said they had taken active steps to support the Tea Party, such as donating money or attending a rally self. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points and plus or minus 9 percentage points for Tea Party activists only.

"(CNN) -- Authorities have recovered human remains from a large crocodile that's believed to have taken a man from his boat in Australia's remote north. Rangers shot dead two saltwater crocodiles in the Northern Territory's Kakadu National Park on Sunday after searching through the night for a 62-year-old man who was reportedly snatched at a waterhole on the South Alligator River the previous afternoon. One of the crocodiles, measuring around 15.5 feet (4.7 meters), contained human remains, police told reporters Sunday. A statement on the Northern Territory Police Force Facebook page said the victim's body had been recovered and a report would be prepared for the Coroner. The man had been fishing with his son, wife and daughter-in-law when the incident occurred, Northern Territory Police Sgt. Andrew Hocking said. The victim's family witnessed the attack but were unable to save him. With poor cellphone coverage across large parts of the remote region, the man's wife and daughter-in-law drove two hours to alert authorities to the attack, according to the Northern Territory News. Police and park rangers searched the area with a helicopter and boats over the weekend, and found two large crocodiles about a mile (1.5 kilometers) from where the man was last seen, according to Hocking. Police have not released the victim's name. ""This is a tragic event and our thoughts are with the family during this very difficult time,"" said Commander Bruce Porter of the Northern Command. A crocodile expert, Grahame Webb, said it was unusual for the reptiles to attack at this time of year as they are rarely active during the cooler months, local media reported. ""They tend to move around a lot more when it warms up... and that's when they're more dangerous,"" he said. The crocodile-infested waters of Kakadu National Park make it a notoriously hazardous area for humans. But most attacks involve swimmers, not people on boats, according to a study in the Wilderness & Environmental Medicine journal. In January, a 12-year-old boy was killed by a crocodile while swimming with friends in a waterhole near Mudginberri. Florida looking for crocodile response agents .

"(CNN) -- Researchers are developing a specialized skin ""printing"" system that could be used in the future to treat soldiers wounded on the battlefield. Scientists at the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine were inspired by standard inkjet printers found in many home offices. ""We started out by taking a typical desktop inkjet cartridge. Instead of ink we use cells, which are placed in the cartridge,"" said Dr. Anthony Atala, director of the institute. The device could be used to rebuild damaged or burned skin. The project is in pre-clinical phases and may take another five years of development before it is ready to be used on human burn victims, he said. Other universities, including Cornell University and the Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, are working on similar projects and will speak on the topic on Sunday at the American Association for the Advancement of Science conference in Washington. These university researchers say organs -- not just skin -- could be printed using similar techniques. Burn injuries account for 5% to 20% of combat-related injuries, according to the Armed Forces Institute of Regenerative Medicine. The skin printing project is one of several projects at Wake Forest largely funded by that institute, which is a branch of the U.S. Department of Defense. Wake Forest will receive approximately $50 million from the Defense Department over the next five years to fund projects, including the skin-creating system. Researchers developed the skin ""bio-printer"" by modifying a standard store-bought printer. One modification is the addition of a three-dimensional ""elevator"" that builds on damaged tissue with fresh layers of healthy skin. The skin-printing process involves several steps. First, a small piece of skin is taken from the patient. The sample is about half the size of a postage stamp, and it is taken from the patient by using a chemical solution. Those cells are then separated and replicated on their own in a specialized environment that catalyzes this cell development. ""We expand the cells in large quantities. Once we make those new cells, the next step is to put the cells in the printer, on a cartridge, and print on the patient,"" Atala said. The printer is then placed over the wound at a distance so that it doesn't touch the burn victim. ""It's like a flat-bed scanner that moves back and forth and put cells on you,"" said Atala. Once the new cells have been applied, they mature and form new skin. Specially designed printer heads in the skin bio-printer use pressurized nozzles -- unlike those found in traditional inkjet printers. The pressure-based delivery system allows for a safe distance between the printer and the patient and can accommodate a variety of body types, according to a 2010 report from the Armed Forces Institute of Regenerative Medicine. The device can fabricate healthy skin in anywhere from minutes to a few hours, depending on the size and type of burn, according to the report. ""You are building up the cells layer after layer after layer,"" Atala said. Acquiring an adequate sample can be a challenge in victims with extensive burns, he said, since there is sometimes ""not enough (skin) to go around with a patient with large burns,"" Atala said. The sample biopsy would be used to grow new cells then placed in the printer cartridge, said Atala. Researchers said it is difficult to speculate when the skin printer may be brought to the battlefield, because of the stringent regulatory steps for a project of this nature. Once the skin-printing device meets federal regulations, military officials are optimistic it will benefit the general population as well as soldiers. ""We're not making anything military-unique,"" said Terry Irgens, a program director at the U.S Army Medical Materiel Development Activity. ""We hope it will benefit both soldier and civilian,"" he said. In the meantime, researchers said they're pleased with results of preliminary laboratory testing with the skin printer. Atala said the researchers already have been able to make ""healthy skin.""","Scientists used a modified inkjet printer loaded with living cells .
""We are engineering human skin,"" says Dr. Anthony Atala .

"(CNN) -- Tania Julin remembers the deep gut pain she felt when she found out nearly three years ago that Chiquita Brands International had paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to a Marxist rebel group in Colombia that had abducted and killed her missionary husband. The pain remains, but Julin felt some relief last week when a federal judge rejected Chiquita's motion to dismiss a damage suit she and four other widows brought against the Ohio-based company. ""My stomach still turns today at the thought of fellow Americans paying terrorists,"" Julin said. ""It just makes my stomach sick."" Chiquita, which has admitted making payments to the rebels and was fined $25 million by the U.S. Justice Department, says it was victimized. ""Chiquita acquiesced to extortion payments to protect the lives of its employees,"" company spokesman Ed Loyd said. To some analysts, the issue highlights the difficulties of conducting business in war-torn areas. Marxist guerrillas who call themselves the Armed Revolutionary Forces of Colombia, commonly known as FARC, declared war on the government in 1964. Chiquita had more than 200 banana farms in Colombia before selling them in 2004. ""It's really tough doing business in an environment that is lawless and the state is largely absent,"" said Bruce Bagley, professor of international studies at the University of Miami. For Julin, though, the issue is deeply personal. She had been married to Mark Rich for 3½ years when FARC rebels burst into their home in Pucuro, Panama, across the border from Colombia, on January 31, 1993. The rebels abducted Rich while his wife and two daughters -- ages 11 months and 2½ years -- watched in horror. The FARC abducted two other members of the New Tribes Mission around the same time and demanded a $5 million ransom for the three men about a week later. One year later, the rebels abducted two other missionaries belonging to the same Christian group. A $3 million ransom was demanded for their release. No ransom was paid for any of them. The families did not know anything about their loved ones for years. It was a tough time for Julin's daughters. ""They went through all of their growing-up years that they can remember asking where their daddy was and if he could come home for their birthdays,"" Julin said. She and the wives of the other men abducted in 1993 found out the truth in December 2000, when New Tribes Mission officials told them the FARC had killed the three captives in 1996. The Colombian government confirmed the deaths in February 2007. The two men who were abducted in 1994 were killed during a firefight between the FARC and the Colombian military in June 1995. Evidence and eyewitness reports obtained by the Colombian National Prosecutor's Office and the U.S. Justice Department confirmed that the FARC executed the missionaries. The U.S. State Department designated the FARC a foreign terrorist organization on October 8, 1997. The five widows found out another hurtful truth in March 2007, when Chiquita pleaded guilty to violating U.S. antiterrorism laws by providing payments to another Colombian terrorist organization, the paramilitary right-wing United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, known as the AUC. Chiquita made more than 100 payments to the AUC totaling at least $1.7 million, the Justice Department said. As part of those proceedings, Chiquita acknowledged that it had also made payments to the FARC from 1989 to at least 1997. That period included the span during which the five missionaries were abducted and killed. That knowledge still pains Julin. ""I just can hardly stand to think about it too much,"" she said. ""They're like a household name. You feel like you can trust them. ""It's just horrible to think about."" Chiquita's Loyd said the company's sole motivation was to protect the lives of its employees. He cited a 1995 incident in which a bus transporting Chiquita employees was attacked and 25 people aboard it died. In total, he said, more than 50 Chiquita employees were killed in Colombia in the 1990s. ""We're sympathetic to the families,"" he said, ""but Chiquita was being extorted by right-wing groups and left-wing groups. There was a very real fear, a very real threat to U.S. citizens."" That argument does not wash with Gary M. Osen, an attorney for the families. ""There's no law that says you have to operate in areas where you have to pay terrorists,"" Osen said. ""That's something they chose to do."" Julin, a 40-year-old kindergarten teacher at a church school near Orlando, Florida, filed suit in March 2008. Civil provisions of the U.S. Anti-Terrorism Act of 1991 allow American citizens, their heirs and their estates to be paid compensation for injuries suffered as a result of international terrorism. The families ""allege that Chiquita, knowing that FARC was a terrorist organization, intentionally agreed to provide money, weapons and services to it as part of a common scheme to subvert local trade unions, protect Chiquita's farms and shipments, harm Chiquita's competitors, [and] strengthen FARC's military capabilities, and that [the families] were injured by overt acts done in furtherance of the common scheme,"" U.S. District Judge Kenneth A. Marra wrote in his 34-page ruling allowing the suit to go forward. Court records show that Chiquita initially made monthly cash payments to the FARC ranging from $20,000 to $100,000. Eventually, Chiquita's payments were fixed to a percentage of the company's gross revenues from its Colombia banana business. Ultimately, up to 10 percent of those revenues were diverted to the FARC. The company also supplied weapons, ammunition and other supplies to the rebels, the victims' families allege. The families also said ""Chiquita went to great lengths to hide its relationship with FARC,"" Marra noted in the February 4 ruling. ""The payments were often delivered by a former American military pilot known as 'Kaiser,' who held a management position with Chiquita in Colombia,"" the judge said the families allege. According to the families, Marra said, Chiquita placed false names and nonexistent employees on its payroll, providing the money on local paydays to regional FARC commanders. The company also helped the FARC create front organizations to which Chiquita could channel money, the victims' families said. In addition, the judge said, the families accuse Chiquita of working with FARC-controlled labor unions as another way to channel payments to the guerrillas. Chiquita spokesman Loyd and one of the company's attorneys, Jonathan M. Sperling, declined to discuss Friday whether the families' allegations noted by Marra are factual. The judge's ruling means the case can go to the discovery phase, in which each party can obtain documents and evidence from the other side. ""We needed to pass this hurdle in order to go forward,"" said Steven M. Steingard, another attorney for the families. Loyd expressed confidence that the company will be exonerated. ""It makes no sense to make Chiquita or Chiquita employees liable for the horrible crimes that those groups committed,"" Loyd said. Said Osen, the attorney for the other side, ""Chiquita is intent on defending what we consider the indefensible."" No amount for monetary damages has been asked, Osen and Steingard said. Julin, who has remarried, says she has a reason beyond dollars and cents. ""All those years of not knowing if he was alive or dead,"" she said. ""There never has been any closure.""","Judge dismisses company's attempt to dismiss widows' damage suit .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Beijing ushered in the Year of the Dragon with a bold move. Starting this week, the city's Environmental Monitoring Center has begun reporting air quality data that includes readings of PM2.5, or Particulate Matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers, and other pollutants. Zhao Jialin, a blogger on Sina Weibo, a Twitter-like microblog site, tweeted: ""Thank the government for making this effort to solve the problem. It is a Chinese New Year gift from them to the people."" Changhua Wu, Greater China director of The Climate Group, a London-based independent group, hailed it as ""a major step forward"" for China's air pollution control efforts. ""This decision is a timely response of the government to a public outcry to tighten the standards and regulations on air pollutants,"" she says. Contrary to Chinese officials' claims that the city's air quality has improved since it hosted the 2008 Olympic Games, many residents in Beijing have complained about worsening air pollution. ""Reached the standard?"" asked Chinese blogger Fenghuangming. ""They didn't just pick the spot where the air quality is the best, did they?"" Public cynicism and frustration peaked several days ago when for two days the city was covered with heavy haze and smog, forcing the cancellation of almost 700 flights at Beijing airports. Debate over the credibility of Beijing's air quality reporting has been brewing for months. It all came to a boil in November when Beijing's Environmental Monitoring Center reported the city's air quality as ""slightly polluted,"" while the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, using its own monitoring instruments, tweeted its real-time reading as ""hazardous."" Why the discrepancy? Beijing, it turned out, merely reported the PM 10 readings, which measured only larger particles, while the U.S. Embassy readings measured ozone density and PM 2.5, referring to particulates ""small enough to get into the lungs and the blood stream,"" according to the embassy website. Should China adopt the stricter PM2.5 standards? Some prominent personalities, including Chinese environmentalists, entrepreneurs and journalists, think so. Last December, real estate mogul Pan Shiyi conducted an online poll on Sina Weibo. More than 90% of the more than 40,000 respondents agreed that ""the authorities should adopt PM2.5 standard this year (2011)."" Four percent believed ""it can wait until next year,"" while only one percent thought there was no need to adopt it. Experts say Beijing's adoption of PM2.5 this week shows the growing influence of local public opinion. ""It seems clear that public pressure has played a role and has speeded up Beijing city's implementation of the new measures,"" says Deborah Seligsohn, advisor of the World Resources Institute, which runs a climate energy and pollution program in China. Although China sometimes seems to drag its feet in solving its environmental problems, Seligsohn says the Chinese have taken some creditable steps. ""China has implemented the largest build-out of Flue Gas Desulfurization, or scrubbers, ever seen over the last five years,"" she says. ""These are to control sulfur dioxide on power plants."" Beijing has also increased its enforcement of building standards. ""Beijing and other cities are quite good at installing insulation and other building efficiency measures that reduce energy use and this reduce pollution,"" says the Beijing-based expert. Seligsohn also praises Beijing's push to expand its network of subway lines. ""People often forget that they've continued to build major lines since the Olympics,"" she says. ""It wasn't just for show, it was to serve this city."" Four new subway lines are expected to start operating later this year. Fares on subways and public buses remain cheap to encourage more people to take public transport. The number of vehicles in Beijing reached 4.98 million last year, worsening traffic congestion and air pollution. ""We have a high population density,"" says Song Guojun, a professor at Renmin University. ""It's not necessary for everyone to drive their own cars. If we have a more developed subway system and public buses, it's not difficult to control the number of cars."" Despite all these efforts, experts say, Beijing is still a long way from cleaning up its reputation as a polluted city. Seligsohn likens Beijing with Los Angeles. ""With their difficult meteorological conditions and a large number of pollution sources, addressing pollution is a long-term and difficult task,"" she explains. ""LA began to combat air pollution in the mid-1950s, well before US national regulation, and still in the 1970s, 20 years later, it was famous for its smog. In the 40-plus years since the Clean Air Act was passed, LA has never been fully in compliance with EPA standards, even though it has continued to improve."" Beijing has likewise made a lot of progress since 2006, Seligsohn said. ""But they have years of work ahead of them, and there isn't one single silver bullet or one fundamental problem. What is good is that they have begun, and they have an engaged public that supports tighter regulation."" Pan, the real estate billionaire who pushed for PM 2.5 readings, said adopting stricter standards is the right step. ""Only when people have the knowledge of the air quality around them will they change unhealthy behavior,"" he said. With the adoption of PM2.5, Beijing residents may now reasonably expect to get realistic readings -- ""hazardous,"" not ""slightly polluted"" -- when the city's air quality is really bad.","Many residents in Beijing have complained about worsening air pollution .

"(CNN) -- More than a decade after his execution, Cameron Todd Willingham is still a pawn in the debate over the death penalty. Opponents of capital punishment say Willingham's is a clear case of an inmate being wrongfully executed, while the original prosecutor and state of Texas have been steadfast in their assertion that Willingham should be no one's cause cÃ©lÃ¨bre. ""Willingham was a psychopathic killer who murdered his three children,"" John H. Jackson, the former Navarro County prosecutor who handled the case in 1992, wrote in an e-mail. ""He submitted to a polygraph with predictable results, he confessed the murders to his wife, the trial evidence established two prior incidents when he tried to kill his children in utero by vicious attacks on his wife."" Willingham was executed in February 2004 after being found guilty in an arson that killed his children, 2-year-old Amber and 1-year-old twins Karmon and Kameron. His family has fought to have his name cleared ever since. The Innocence Project filed a grievance Monday with the State Bar of Texas, asking that it investigate the now-retired prosecutor. The grievance alleges Jackson ""fabricated and concealed evidence,"" including documents indicating that a jailhouse informant received special treatment in exchange for his testimony, which Jackson and the informant both claimed was not true during the original trial. A story in The Washington Post on Sunday, written by the Marshall Project, a journalistic group focusing on criminal justice matters, said Willingham's case is especially important to death penalty opponents because it could provide the first case showing ""conclusively that an innocent man was put to death in the modern era of capital punishment."" The story points out that Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, in upholding Kansas' death penalty in 2006, said opponents had failed to show a single case in which a convict was executed for a crime she or he didn't commit. Evidence and testimony at trial showed that Willingham had been involved in criminal activity since his teens and had been verbally and physically abusive with his family. Witnesses alleged that during the blaze, Willingham seemed more concerned with rescuing his car than his daughters. Appellate courts, including the Supreme Court, declined to stop Willingham's execution, yet in his final words, he claimed to be ""an innocent man convicted of a crime I did not commit."" Since his conviction, the science employed by investigators to determine that the fatal fire was an arson, as well as a post-conviction claim by his ex-wife, Stacy Kuykendall, that Willingham confessed to her, have been matters of debate. An alleged alliance . The Marshall Project story reports that informant Johnny Webb, whose testimony was integral to convicting Willingham, now says he lied on the witness stand in exchange for favors from Jackson. The story also alleges that correspondence between Jackson and Johnny Webb indicate the two were in cahoots. Jackson told CNN the letters are being misconstrued. In one letter, Webb writes that his testimony against Willingham resulted in retaliation from other inmates. ""Here, the state offered me certain benefits in exchange for my testimony, which resulted in sending a man to death row. This resulted in a murder contract being placed on my head. Because I kept my end of the promise, the state is bound to uphold theirs until my release from incarceration,"" Webb wrote to Jackson in 1996. Other documents cited in the Marshall Project report indicate Jackson worked to have the charges on which Webb was convicted reduced, to have Webb released early on a robbery conviction and to have him moved to a less dangerous prison. In a 1996 letter to a Texas Department of Criminal Justice official, Jackson wrote that Webb should be afforded an ""out-of-sequence parole hearing"" based on his cooperation in the Williingham case and the subsequent threats against him. Jackson wrote in closing that incarceration would not aid Webb's rehabilitation and would jeopardize the Willingham conviction. Thus, ""Webb's cooperation in the murder prosecution without expectation of leniency should be accorded some consideration,"" he said. Webb was granted parole in 1998, but within months was back in jail on drug charges, which constituted a parole violation. In 2000, Webb said in a handwritten letter that he wished to recant his testimony. The Marshall Project alleges the note was never placed in Webb's file or disclosed to Willingham's attorneys. ""I am given no other choice but to make this motion to recant testimony at this time,"" Webb wrote. ""I was forced to testify against Mr. Willingham by the DA's office and other officials. I was made to lie. Mr. Willingham is innocent of all charges."" 'Patently untrue' Reached at his Corsicana, Texas, office, Jackson declined a chance to present his side of the allegations in a phone interview. Despite CNN messages left via phone and e-mail, he said he was ""skeptical CNN wants to present my side of the story."" CNN wasn't given a chance to ask Jackson specific questions about the allegations -- namely, reports that numerous fire investigators now say the original conviction was based on outdated arson science and a Marshall Project allegation that a wealthy businessman with connections to Jackson provided Webb money and favors. Jackson did, however, provide a 250-word response to some of the allegations against him. ""The new tack is that I promised the jailhouse witness Webb leniency if he would testify that Willingham confessed,"" Jackson wrote. ""This is patently untrue and I interviewed Webb before others and very sincerely advised him that I could offer him nothing in return for his testimony."" After ""supposedly reputable journalists,"" whom Jackson didn't name, outed Webb as a snitch who had cooperated with authorities, the white supremacist gang, the Aryan Brotherhood, began threatening Webb. There were also efforts by Willingham's defense team and prison guards colluding with the Aryan Brotherhood to coerce Webb to recant, and a journalist even tried to bribe the informant, Jackson wrote. ""AFTER (emphasis Jackson's) the Willingham trial I did everything in my power to prevent his being killed by the (Aryan Brotherhood),"" he said. ""Webb wrote letters warning that he would be forced to write a recantation because of death threats from the (Aryan Brotherhood) and their stooge prison guard, but that the recantation would be false."" Jackson also alluded in his e-mail to Willingham's ex-wife's claim that Willingham confessed to her before his execution. Indeed, in 2010, responding to the Willingham family's push to have her former husband's name cleared, Stacy Kuykendall told reporters gathered at an Austin courthouse that Willingham admitted setting the blaze. ""Todd murdered Amber, Karmon and Kameron. He burnt them,"" she said. ""He admitted he burnt them to me, and he was convicted for his crime. That is the closest to justice that my daughters will ever get."" She would later tell the Chicago Tribune and The New Yorker magazine that Willingham made no such confession to her, according to their reports. Arson or no arson... In his e-mail to CNN, Jackson did not address the arson science used in the investigation, but he wrote in a 2009 guest column for the Corsicana Daily Sun that there was sufficient evidence of Willingham's guilt without the problematic findings in the arson report. ""The Willingham trial has become a sort of cause celebre by anti-death penalty proponents because it seems to be an example of outmoded scientific techniques which led to a miscarriage of justice,"" he said. ""In fact, the trial testimony (the newspaper) reported in 1991 contains overwhelming evidence of guilt completely independent of the undeniably flawed forensic report."" He pointed to seven factors that he said helped establish Willingham's guilt, including his violent past, evidence showing someone had blocked the door's back home with a refrigerator, the ""superficial"" nature of Willingham's burns and an analysis suggesting Willingham hadn't inhaled excessive smoke, as he claimed, during his rescue attempt. Little seems certain in Willingham's case, outside the fact that death penalty opponents and proponents staunchly disagree over his guilt. Disagreement has been a mark of the case, as Willingham's own defense attorney told CNN in 2009 that he thought his client was guilty, while one of the jurors who convicted him expressed doubts. Texas Gov. Rick Perry has defended his decision not to stay Willingham's execution, calling him a ""monster."" Meanwhile, Innocence Project Co-Director Barry Scheck said in the Monday news release that not only should the verdict be called into question, but so should the man who prosecuted Willingham. ""We are asking the State Bar of Texas to investigate and prosecute this matter, which we believe is of profound importance to all citizens in this country. Whether one supports or opposes the death penalty, the execution of an innocent man is, as Justice (Sandra Day) O'Connor has said, a 'constitutionally intolerable event,'"" Scheck said. Jackson has seen his case under fire before, and he stands by the verdict today, just as he did when it was handed down in 1992 and when he penned his guest commentary for the local paper in 2009. ""While anti-death-penalty advocates can muster some remarkably good arguments, Todd Willingham should not be anyone's poster child,"" he wrote then. CNN's Matt Smith contributed to this report.","Cameron Todd Willingham was executed in 2004 for killing his 3 children .

"Washington (CNN) -- A ""defiant"" pregnant woman who was subjected to three Taser stun gun shocks by law enforcement officers after refusing to sign a speeding ticket will not get her appeal addressed by the Supreme Court. The justices without comment Tuesday rejected separate petitions from both Malaika Brooks and the Seattle Police officers sued for excessive force. The court also rejected a similar appeal from a separate plaintiff in Hawaii. Hundreds of such Taser-related lawsuits have been working their way through lower state and federal courts, but the Supreme Court so far has refused to address the issue of what the officers call ""a useful pain technique."" Brooks was seven months pregnant and driving her 11-year-old son to school in 2004. Police clocked her going 32 miles per hour in a 20 mph school zone. She handed over her driver's license but denied wrongdoing. A speeding citation was issued but the woman refused to sign it as state law required. Brooks later claimed she mistakenly believed signing the ticket was an admission of guilt. An argument ensued with two police officers. A federal appeals court later said, ""she remained defiant even after (Officer) Jones told her she'd be arrested if she continued to refuse."" A police sergeant soon arrived and informed the motorist that force would be applied if she did not get out of her vehicle as ordered. Brooks refused. A Taser electro-shock weapon was displayed, and officers warned her it would be used if there was further resistance. Brooks explained her pregnancy, and later claimed one of the officers replied, ""Well, don't do it in her stomach, do it in her thigh."" The Taser was applied in a ""drive-stun"" mode three times in a one-minute span -- in her thigh, arm, then neck, according to court testimony. Brooks fell out of the vehicle, was dragged onto the street face down, and then was handcuffed. She gave birth weeks later to a healthy girl. Soon after, the then-33-year-old woman was cited for a misdemeanor, refusing to sign the ticket, but not for resisting arrest. She sued, claiming emotional and physical scars from the incident. A federal appeals court in San Francisco eventually issued a split decision, finding excessive force was used, but saying the officers could not be sued because ""it was not sufficiently clear"" in the law at the time that what they were doing was a constitutional violation. First the judges found the force applied was unreasonable. ""The record unambiguously reflects that the officers knew about and considered Brooks's pregnancy before tasing her,"" said the ruling from October. ""Three tasings in such rapid succession provided no time for Brooks to recover from the extreme pain she experienced, gather herself, and reconsider her refusal to comply."" But on the immunity question, the officers were cleared from liability. Two judges said Brooks brought some of the problems on herself. ""The officers, for their part, were endlessly patient, despite being called liars and otherwise abused by Brooks,"" said Chief Judge Alex Kozinski. ""They deserve our praise, not the opprobrium of being declared constitutional violators. The city of Seattle should award them commendations for grace under fire."" And Judge Barry Silverman noted force must sometimes be used even when the underlying offense is minor. ""No constitutional violation was shown. Brooks conceded that the police had the right to remove her from the car when she repeatedly refused to step out voluntarily,"" said the judge. ""There are only so many ways that a person can be extracted from a vehicle against her will, and none of them is pretty. Fists, batons, choke holds, dogs, tear gas, and chemical spray all carry their own risks to suspects and officers alike."" A similar appeal heard by the judges came from Maui, when a 2006 domestic disturbance got out of hand after officers arrived on the scene. Jayzel Mattos was tased with a dart-mode device in a rapidly escalating and confusing scene inside a residence. She and her husband, Troy, were arrested on harassment, resisting arrest and obstruction charges, which were eventually dropped. The appeals court ruled the same: force was excessive, but the officers could not be sued. The appeals court rulings ultimately cleared the officers, but made clear future law enforcement use of a Taser and similar devices might be a constitutional violation of a suspect's search-and-seizure rights. The Supreme Court has generally been tolerant of police use of force when dealing with belligerent or defiant individuals, but has not yet accepted any cases on the specific use of Tasers, a brand name from a company by the same name. The justices have noted similar excessive force claims are by nature fact-specific, and have usually been reluctant to substitute their hindsight judgment for the real-time decision-making officers must practice in a stressful, often dangerous situation. In an unrelated the 2007 ruling, the high court noted that while any ""attempt to craft an easy-to-apply legal test in the Fourth Amendment context is admirable, in the end we must still slosh our way through the factbound morass of 'reasonableness.' Whether or not (an officer's use of forceful) actions constituted application of ""deadly force,"" all that matters is whether (the officer's) actions were reasonable."" Tasers are handheld devices that use electric current to cause a disruption of physical control from ""neuromuscular incapacitation,"" according to the company's website. Some law enforcement agencies consider them a safer alternative to other forced-restraint methods, for both suspects and police. Brooks asked the high court to hold the officers liable for damages, while the officers asked the high court not to restrict future use of the forced-compliance and immobilizing tools. Their employer, the Seattle Police Department, had asked the justices to stay out of the case, worried it and other law enforcement agencies would be subject to a flood of personal injury claims. Brooks herself is continuing a separate state lawsuit seeking damages. The cases are Daman v. Brooks (11-898); Brooks v. Daman (11-1045); Agarano v. Mattos (11-1032); and Mattos v. Agarano (11-1165).","Malaika Brooks sued Seattle Police officers, saying they used excessive force .

"Washington (CNN) -- The presidential campaign fundraising numbers being reported paint a picture of what's to come over the 13 months until the 2012 election: A flood of television ads, cross-country bus tours and a lot of handshakes. Money drives a campaign, and fundraising is a signal of its strength. It also allows campaigns to get ahead in the media wars -- on TV, radio, online, in the mail -- and on-the-ground grassroots outreach. President Barack Obama's campaign has pledged to raise an eye-popping $1 billion for his re-election campaign -- an unheard of figure in American politics -- Obama's campaign raised nearly $750 million for the 2008 election. To put that into perspective, Republican presidential candidate John McCain raised $239 million from donors and received $84 million collected from public funds -- something that Obama chose not to participate in. So why does it cost so much to campaign for election in the United States? Bigger country = bigger money . ""America is the largest democracy in the world and that's going to cost a lot of money to express yourself and get your message out, get the vote out, get people to support you and put in (campaign) infrastructure,"" said Republican strategist Ron Bonjean. In order for a candidate to reach all 50 states within an election cycle, a trove of money will be needed to cover that much ground. And then there's length of U.S. campaigns. Keith Boykin, a Democratic strategist and former staffer on Bill Clinton's successful 1992 campaign, said the length of the U.S. election cycle dictates that candidates must pile up funds to survive the long haul. ""If you're running for prime minister in Britain, you don't spend a year and a half or two years running for office,"" he said. ""The election is called and the opposition party decides it's going to mount a campaign and you have a concentrated time to focus on that."" (Under Britain's parliamentary system, the party with the most votes becomes the ruling party, and that in turn determines who becomes the prime minister). In Britain, a law known as the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 regulates campaign spending -- anything from party political broadcasts, advertising, rallies and even ""issuing disparaging material relating to another party or its candidates,"" according to the government's website. In 2010, the parties and their candidates were regulated by time frames: The ""long campaign"" -- from January 1 to April 12 when Parliament was dissolved â€” and the ""short campaign"" from the dissolution of Parliament through election day. According to the website, the long campaign had a limit of 25,000 pounds (about $39,000) and 7,150 pounds (about $11,200) for the short campaign. The ad wars . Television advertising is by far the most expensive item in a campaign's budget. Air time in major markets in key swing states can cost a campaign millions of dollars. Obama spent much of his money in 2008 advertising in large -- and expensive -- markets in battleground states. The eventual Republican nominee will have to blanket those markets, too. And that's when big Republican donors will come calling, Bonjean said. ""A lot of wealthy donors are waiting on the sidelines waiting to see who the Republican candidate is going to be to get behind,"" Bonjean said. ""Once that happens it will be very competitive with President Obama."" Bonjean believes that Republicans will be successful in attracting younger voters and small donors this time around -- something Obama capitalized on in 2008. Boykin said the fear for the Obama campaign is that because the economy is weak and Republicans are eager, if not desperate, to replace him, he has to cover all his bases. He needs the support not only of his liberal base but moderates and independents, too -- and do everything he can to get his message out. ""Part of the problem he has had as president is that despite very effective communication effort as a campaigner, he hasn't been effective in communicating his successes while he's been governing,"" he said. ""And he's going to have to do that more effectively in the coming months."" It's not just TV ads that deplete a campaign's bank account -- it's the entire get-out-the-vote effort. ""I think elections have become more costly because more money is spent on television advertising, on a national campaign infrastructure ... campaign planes, the buses, the whole movement from city to city,"" Bonjean said. In countries such as Britain, France, Mexico and Spain, for example, candidates can blanket media markets with less money. And there are restrictions in some countries on how many ads can air. Big vs. small . Obama's campaign was able to raise $42.8 million between July and the end of September, an Obama campaign aide told CNN. Between the campaign and the Democratic National Committee, they raised more than $70 million in the third quarter. Some Democratic sources had earlier expected the combined total to be $55 million. Read more on Obama's fundraising numbers . The $42 million figure most likely will be close to or exceed the total raised by all of the Republican presidential candidates together for this quarter. Of numbers released by Republican campaigns before they have to formally submit their fundraising to the Federal Elections Commission, Texas Gov. Rick Perry's campaign said it raised $17 million, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney's campaign estimated it raised between $11 million and $14 million and Texas Rep. Ron Paul's campaign said it raised around $8 million. Other Republican campaigns did not release their figures ahead of the deadline. In the second quarter -- running between April and June -- Obama's campaign was able to raise a record-setting $87 million. The campaign released a list of more than 270 fundraisers --so-called ""bundlers""-- who helped bring in at least $50,000 for the campaign and the joint Obama for America-Democratic National Committee victory fund. In addition, 31 people raised more than $500,000 including Hollywood producer Jeffrey Katzenberg, Vogue Editor Anna Wintour and former New Jersey Gov. and U.S. Sen. Jon Corzine. Bundlers are an integral part of campaign fundraising efforts, since individual donations are limited. While federal election law requires campaigns to disclose the names of donors of more than $250, there is no requirement to reveal the names of bundlers. Obama was able to rake in a large part of his 2008 campaign funds from a swath of small donors -- most of them young. This year he is hoping to get those donors back. Shortly after he announced his 2012 campaign in early April, his staff reported around 23,000 small donors -- who typically give anywhere from $25 to $100 -- gave to the campaign. ""Obama was largely successful at getting small donors through the social media phenomenon created around his campaign,"" Bonjean said. ""Now the Republicans are mimicking that. So I think they'll be much more competitive with that."" Where's it coming from? Boykin and other activists believe that too many politicians are guided by special interest groups and wealthy donors -- not the average American Joe. ""We have a campaign financing system that is a grotesque way out of touch with reality of the American people,"" Boykin said. ""You have to be wealthy or in touch with the very wealthy in order to get elected to almost any political office -- not just the presidency. Because of that, corporations and outside groups tend to have a large influence in our elections. And on January 11, the Supreme Court ruled that big business, unions and nonprofits now have more power to spend freely in federal elections. A 5-4 conservative majority crafted a narrow overhaul of federal campaign spending. The justices eased long-standing restrictions on ""independent spending"" by corporations and unions in political campaigns. Read more about the case . Shortly after the ruling, Obama blasted the decision saying ""the special interests and their lobbyists even more power in Washington -- while undermining the influence of average Americans who make small contributions to support their preferred candidates."" Boykin added that there seems to be a concerted effort to protect the corporate interests and the moneyed interests ""because those are the people who write the rules."" The past is the past . The Federal Elections Commission has a breakdown of presidential campaign receipts ( in millions of dollars) going back to the 1996 presidential race, that shows how dramatically campaign fundraising and spending has multiplied in a short time: . 2004 . George W. Bush: $269.6 . John Kerry: $234.6 . 2000 . Bush: $95.5 . Al Gore: $48.1 . 1996 . Bill Clinton: $42.5 . Bob Dole: $44.9 .

"(CNN) -- Everyone loves a sporting feud. Some of the most enduring rivalries in sport have been born through individuals, or entire teams, that weren't particularly fond of the other. Who doesn't enjoy the sight of two men who should know better -- Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho and Arsenal counterpart Arsene Wenger -- shoving each other on the sidelines during an English Premier League match? Just look at the ill-tempered clash between Italian champions Juventus and rivals Roma on Sunday night that spawned three controversial penalties and two red cards after a late melee. Even cricket -- that most genteel of sports -- is at it, ex-England cricketer Kevin Pietersen releasing an autobiography in which he takes a swipe at former teammates and coaches. Here, CNN takes a look at five sporting feuds that are en vogue at present. Jose Mourinho vs. Arsene Wenger . These two great rivals haven't seen eye to eye almost from the day Mourinho pitched up at Chelsea from Portuguese football in 2004. Their first spat centered on Wenger's criticism of Chelsea's lavish spending under billionaire Russian owner Roman Abramovich, Mourinho hitting back by calling his opposite number a ""voyeur."" Chelsea's boss later claimed he had a dossier on things Wenger had said about his club, hinting at legal action. It didn't take long for Mourinho to revive the rivalry upon his return to Chelsea in 2013, calling Wenger a ""specialist in failure."" On Sunday, Wenger shoved Mourinho on the touchline after reacting angrily to a strong tackle on his player Alexis Sanchez. The fourth official intervened, separating the two, as Chelsea went on to win 2-0 and make it 12 matches without defeat for Mourinho against Wenger. Afterwards Chelsea's coach said there was ""no problem"" between the two, while Wenger said ""What is there to regret?"" Kevin Pietersen vs Matt Prior . The man referred to by fans as ""KP"" has waited a long time to have his say on his sacking from the England cricket team after a disastrous tour to Australia. England were thumped 5-0 in the Ashes by its most fierce rival at the turn of the year and when Pietersen had his contract canceled in February, he had to wait until October until a confidentiality clause expired to have his say. He was accused of being ""disengaged"" by the England and Wales Cricket Board but has hit back, claiming they told him he was being dismissed for ""cricketing reasons"" and wouldn't elaborate. Pietersen reserves particular ire for Prior, England's former vice captain, who he accuses of fostering a bullying culture within the dressing room. The wicketkeeper is also labeled as a ""back-stabber"" by Pietersen, for revealing details of a supposedly confidential team meeting during the Australia tour. Prior took to Twitter to say that he would respond, but at a later date and not on the social media site. He said he was looking forward to reading the book and joked: ""Might bully my kids into getting it for me for Xmas!!"" Tom Watson vs. Phil Mickelson . Eight-time major winner Tom Watson was supposed to be the man to finally secure a United States victory in golf's premier team competition, the Ryder Cup, at the 2014 tournament in Scotland last month . But just like seven of the last eight captains, he tasted defeat, as Europe made it three on the bounce courtesy of a 16½-11½ victory at Gleneagles. The inquest began within hours of the final shot, and it emerged from a surprising source within the team -- Phil Mickelson, a man with five majors of his own. His eulogy about 2008 skipper Paul Azinger -- the only man to the lead the U.S. to victory this century -- was seen as thinly veiled criticism of Watson, and turned the team's press conference into a tension-filled affair. Mickelson said Azinger had involved the players in his decision making process and formulated a ""real game plan,"" the implication being that Watson had done neither during his tenure. The captain, sitting a few seats down from his player, replied: ""(Phil) has a difference of opinion. That's OK. My management philosophy is different than his. I had a different philosophy than Paul. I decided not to go that way."" As details began to leak out about Watson's reign, he released an open letter saying he understood Mickelson's reaction and that the pair had spoken since to try and clear the air. Watson added: ""The bottom line is this. I was their captain. In hindsight whatever mistakes that were made were mine. And I take complete and full responsibility for them."" Juventus vs. AS Roma . It was the most eagerly anticipated clash of the season so far in Italy, as first took on second. Both Serie A champions Juventus and Roma, who finished as runners up in 2013/14 came into their clash on Saturday with 100% records, winning five games out of five. It was a match that most certainly lived up to the hype and included five goals, three controversial penalty decisions and two red cards as Juve came out on top. An ill-tempered clash saw referee Gianluca Rocchi under almost constant fire from the players, each of his penalty decisions provoking controversy. Juve profited from two of those, Roma captain Francesco Totti lamenting his performance after the match, saying the official favored Juventus. The winning goal was scored by Juve defender Leonardo Bonucci, moments before a melee involving players from both sides saw Álvaro Morata and Kostas Manolas sent off. Richard Sherman vs. Patrick Peterson . Seahawks cornerman Sherman relishes his role as one of the most outspoken players in the NFL, but he does have a Superbowl ring to back it up. Recently, it's a rival from Arizona Cardinals that has been taking up a large chunk of his time -- Patrick Peterson, who recently signed a new contract with the Cardinals that made him the highest paid cornerback ever to have played in the NFL.

"(CNN) -- When Curtis Harmon III showed up in front of NFL scouting personnel in Baltimore last month, no one was sure what to expect. After all, how could a man with one arm catch a football? ""I didn't drop a single pass,"" Harmon told CNN. ""Didn't bobble a pass either."" Indeed, in his rundown for a Washington-Baltimore-area sports website, writer Barry Barnes said he was struck by the ""passion, heart and determination"" that Harmon exhibited at the regional combine, where lower-tier players not invited to the national scouting combine pay to be evaluated by the NFL. ""He was consistent with his speed, ran around the cones low with the ball high across his chest, along his collarbone and caught all his passes. Yes, caught all his passes,"" Barnes wrote. Harmon, 25, was born with a birth defect that stopped the growth of his left arm from the elbow down. For his much of his life, the southside Washington native has dealt with stares from strangers, awkward questions about ""what happened"" and of course, the bullies. But from a young age, there's one thing Harmon wanted to become: a professional football player. ""When he was born the doctor told me not to treat him any different and that I would be surprised by what he would be able to achieve,"" his mother, Roberta Scott, said in a phone interview from her home in Clinton, Maryland. He's been defying odds ever since. 'Like a little pro' At age 4, Harmon started playing the drums. Months later, he would learn to play the piano. By the time he was 6, Harmon decided he knew what he wanted to be when he grew up. ""I signed him up with the little league football in our area,"" his mother said. ""And once I did, he was like a little pro already. He's always been really fast."" Harmon put that speed on display at Gwynn Park High School in Prince George's County, Maryland, where he started at fullback. ""It was more than football. It was about discipline,"" Harmon said. ""Ever since I can remember it was just me, my mom and my (older) brother. My dad was shot and killed when I was just a few months old, so my coaches were like my father figures. I learned about life from them."" In 2007, during his senior year, Harmon ran for more than 800 yards. When he wasn't scoring touchdowns, he played defense as a middle linebacker. ""I got a couple of looks from some Division I and II schools, but I decided that the best thing for me was to pursue playing football at a junior college,"" he said. Harmon took a year off from football before taking the field for Valley Forge Military Academy & College in Wayne, Pennsylvania, in 2009. He played two seasons there before transferring to Saddleback College, a community college in Mission Viejo, California, where he racked up 1,200 yards and eight touchdowns in two seasons. ""I've done so many things to make my success work. If that meant I had to transfer, then I did that,"" he said. Dream deferred . In 2013, he moved back East, hoping to play for Winston-Salem State or East Carolina University, neither of which panned out. But rather than let his dream die, he went home and began training to be a professional. ""I probably would have never played football if I let what people think stop me. My dream was to be drafted in the NFL. My cousin Rashad Carmichael ... plays for the (Philadelphia) Eagles. He encouraged me to go to the combine and show the scouts what I was about."" In the runup to this month's NFL draft, as the world watched a cavalcade of storylines -- ranging from defensive phenom Jadeveon Clowney to the first openly gay player ever drafted, Michael Sam -- Harmon's uplifting story went largely unnoticed outside of a short film produced by the website worldstarhiphop.com. But that wasn't enough for the pro scouts. The NFL draft came and went, and Harmon went undrafted. That's where Harmon thought his dream had ended. ""I kinda did expect that I would at least get a shot at being drafted because I felt like I gave it my all. I did better at the drills than people with two hands! Why not get a player who can motivate his team and play 100%?"" A few days later, his agent called with a new opportunity. This weekend, Harmon will travel to an open tryout in Mooresville, North Carolina, a Charlotte suburb, to compete for one of the 46 roster spots on the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League. God's sense of humor . If he's selected, he'll be the first player in CFL history to play with only one arm. But if he makes it, he won't be alone in his journey. Mark Speckman, the running backs coach for the Alouettes, was born without hands. ""God has a funny sense of humor. ... There's only so many one-handed fullbacks and no-hands running backs coaches in pro football,"" Speckman said, laughing during a phone interview from Montreal. While some may think that this was all a devised plan by the club, neither Harmon nor Speckman knew about the other until CNN spoke to the pair. ""It's just a coincidence, a very big coincidence,"" Charles Rooke, the Alouettes' spokesman, said. ""That's a game-changer right there,"" Harmon told CNN after learning about the man who could be his position coach. ""I'm anxious to get down there and just learn from him -- not even football but everything in life. Someone who is just like me. I love that idea."" Harmon's road ahead will not be easy. Under CFL rules, a certain portion of a team's players must be Canadian. Harmon knows competition will be tough. ""I'm trying to get a spot for how I play, not how I look,"" he told CNN. ""The fact of the matter is that what really inspires people is how I'm doing it. I love to inspire people and uplift people. Who wouldn't want a better world? 'Oh Curtis Harmon can go do that? Well I can go do this!' That's what I want people to take away from my story.""","Curtis Harmon will try out for one of 46 roster spots with CFL's Montreal Alouettes .

"London, England (CNN) -- When Queen Elizabeth II stayed away from a grief-stricken London after the 1997 death of Princess Diana, she was criticized for being aloof and failing to respond to public anger and loss. But, according to a new account offered by one of the monarch's closest friends, the truth behind the queen's decision to temporarily abandon her people was her overwhelming concern for the welfare of Diana's sons, Princes William and Harry. Margaret Rhodes, the queen's first cousin and one of her oldest companions, revealed in an interview with CNN that the queen chose to remain at her Scottish residence, Balmoral, because she put her duties as a grandmother over those as a monarch. ""She was castigated... for staying up at Balmoral with the two little boys,"" Rhodes said, speaking ahead of celebrations to mark the 60th anniversary of the queen's succession. ""She was being a proper granny. What was the point of bringing the boys down to sit in London with nothing to do but sit there feeling sad about mum. Personally I think I would have behaved in exactly the same way."" Interactive: Who's who in the House of Windsor . The days after Diana's death were among the darkest of the 86-year-old queen's reign. Her failure to appear even as tributes left by thousands of mourners transformed the streets near Buckingham Palace into a sea of flowers, was at the time blamed on an antipathy towards Diana that clashed with public affection for the ""people's princess."" It was only when Tony Blair, then the prime minister, intervened that she returned to London and acknowledged the outpouring of grief -- a gesture that helped win back waning affections for the royal family. ""It was very sensible, maybe not as queen,"" said Rhodes. ""But she made it all right in the end by coming down and looking at all the flowers."" Born just a few months after the queen, Rhodes has known the monarch her whole life and is widely seen as one of the greatest sources of insight on life within the royal family. After working as a secretary for British the intelligence agency MI6 during World War II, she served as a lady-in-waiting to the queen's mother and was one of the queen's bridesmaids. The two have remained steadfast friends throughout their lives. Rhodes lives in a house close to the royal residence at Windsor Castle, west of London, where she regularly serves the queen a morning tipple of her favorite ""booze."" ""I do see the queen most Sundays,"" Rhodes told CNN. ""We go to the same little church in the park here on Sunday and, unless she's very busy, she comes in and has a drink after church so it keeps up the relationship. Gin and Dubonnet is her booze in the morning."" Rhodes also offered insight on the queen's relationship with Prince Philip, claiming it was love at first sight when the future monarch, barely into her teens, first encountered the dashing young naval officer, then aged 17. ""I think she fell in love when she was 13,"" she said. ""God he was good looking. You know he was a Viking god. She has never looked at anybody else ever and I think he really truly has been a rock."" Both as a young girl and in later years, Rhodes paints a picture of her friend as an ordinary woman who is capable of throwing off the airs of royalty. She tells of the time, after victory was declared in Europe at the end of World War II, that Rhodes accompanied the queen and her sister as they celebrated incognito among the crowds outside Buckingham Palace. ""We all surged up to Trafalgar Square. Everybody was kissing everybody and putting on policemens helmets on their heads, you know that sort of thing. It went on for four nights running. Interactive: A year in the life of the queen . ""We came back to Buckingham Palace and started yelling for the king, the king and queen to come out on the balcony. Their two daughters were yelling, which was also the first time they had seen the balcony from down below, so it was a magical moment. ""We did it for several more nights. There certainly was one occasion when we were doing the conga. We went in one door of the Ritz and congaed our way through and came out the other door. It was all part of the jollifications."" Speaking about the marital troubles that have blighted three of the queen's four children -- Prince Charles, Princess Anne and Prince Andrew -- she described the situation as ""terribly sad."" However, she added, the queen has a sense of humor and an ordinary side to her personality that, had she not taken the throne, would have allowed her to enjoy life outside of royalty. ""If you are the queen you have to be queenly. On her own she's rather like one of us, she laughs at the same jokes. ""I mean if she didn't happen to be born as queen she would be the owner of, hopefully, a rather nice country estate where she would have lots and lots of dogs and horses and she'd be happy.""","Queen's first cousin Margaret Rhodes says monarch put family before country after Diana's death .

"London (CNN) -- Two Australian radio DJs made a prank call to the hospital where Prince William's pregnant wife, Catherine, is staying with acute morning sickness, claiming to be Queen Elizabeth II and her son, Prince Charles. The DJs, from Sydney's 2Day FM station, succeeded in getting through to Kate's private nurse at King Edward VII Hospital and had a brief conversation that included some details of her condition, according to audio of the call posted online. The hospital issued a statement Wednesday confirming that the hoax call had been transferred to a ward in the early hours of Tuesday morning and a short conversation was held with one of the nursing staff. The hospital ""deeply regrets"" the incident, it said. John Lofthouse, chief executive at the hospital, is quoted as saying: ""This was a foolish prank call that we all deplore. We take patient confidentiality extremely seriously and we are now reviewing our telephone protocols."" Prince William's office at Clarence House has not commented on the incident. The radio show posted an apology for the call on its official Twitter feed Wednesday, and issued a statement. ""2Day FM sincerely apologises for any inconvenience caused by the enquiry to Kate's hospital, the radio segment was done with light-hearted intentions, we wish Kate and her family all the best and we're glad to hear she's doing well,"" it said. The two DJs, Mel Greig and Michael Christian, are quoted as saying: ""We were very surprised that our call was put through, we thought we'd be hung up on as soon as they heard our terrible accents."" An earlier tweet by 2Day FM had described it as a ""hilarious prank."" Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, is still receiving treatment after she was admitted to the hospital Monday with hyperemesis gravidarum, a condition which involves nausea and vomiting more severe than the typical morning sickness many women suffer during early pregnancy . Audio of the call posted online reveals that the nurse, sounding nervous, divulged general details of Kate's condition and care. Catherine and William baby news sparks media frenzy . She also tells DJs, who host the Summer 30 show on 2Day FM, what time William left the previous evening and suggests they visit after 9 a.m. that day. The incident is bound to raise concerns over security and privacy provisions at the hospital. Greig, who impersonated the queen, exclaims after the call ends: ""She was giving us real information!"" The conversation was conducted in poorly done English accents and with frequent references to ""Charles"" walking the queen's corgis, her much-loved dogs, but it did not appear to raise alarm bells with hospital staff. The DJs commented on how easy it was to make the prank call. The queen was previously the object of a prank call in 1995, when Canadian DJ Pierre Brassard got through to Buckingham Palace pretending to be then-Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien. According to UK media reports at the time, they spoke for about quarter of an hour and discussed an upcoming referendum on independence for Quebec. The palace said Monday that Catherine, 30, is likely to remain in the hospital for several days. Pregnancy and privacy: Royal Catherine's dilemma . The duchess is not yet 12 weeks pregnant, Clarence House told CNN, so the palace is not announcing a due date for the child. William and Catherine's child will be next in line to the British throne after William, regardless of whether it is a boy or a girl. Planned changes to the law of succession that end the tradition of a boy jumping over an elder sister are already de facto in effect, the British Cabinet Office said. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said Tuesday that all 16 countries that recognize the British monarch as their head of state have formally agreed to the change and British lawmakers will change the rules as soon as possible. Clegg also said that the change in succession will allow someone in line to the throne to marry a Catholic -- but not to be a Catholic. The Church of England is the nation's official church. It split from the Roman Catholic Church in the 16th century. CNN's Max Foster, David Wilkinson, Damien Ward, Jack Maddox and Claudia Rebaza contributed to this report.","NEW: Australian DJs say they were surprised their call with ""terrible accents"" was put through .

"(CNN) -- Season 40 of ""Saturday Night Live"" kicked off over the weekend with much the same assessment as previous seasons: talent that needs seasoning, up-and-down sketches and mixed reviews. ""Are 'SNL's' growing pains over as it enters its 40th season? It certainly didn't seem that way from the show's bizarre season opener,"" wrote EW's Esther Zuckerman. On the other hand, Slate's Sharan Shetty praised the opener as ""one of the better, more consistently funny episodes in a good while."" 40 reasons why 'SNL' matters . Certainly, uneven ""SNLs"" are nothing new. But the new season, with a combination of winning host Chris Pratt and some fresh faces, seemed to draw particularly diverse critiques. The best reviews were for a taped bit on future Marvel projects -- including films based around shopping carts and someone named Pam -- that, the studio promised, will make a mint. ""Who's Pam? Doesn't matter. 'Pam' will make $3 billion,"" the voiceover said. ""Pratt's starring role in 'Guardians of the Galaxy' served as the inspiration for the night's best taped bit,"" wrote The Hollywood Reporter's Ken Tucker. On the other hand, new Weekend Update anchor Michael Che was ""hobbled"" by ""lame jokes,"" Tucker said, not to mention his own nervousness. ""His appearance was a bit rocky: he flubbed a few lines and took a while to get into a rhythm with Colin Jost,"" Shetty wrote. If anyone came out well, it was new player Pete Davidson, who earned plaudits all over the place. ""Davidson ... was the revelation of the episode,"" Shetty wrote. And Twitter definitely smiled on the 20-year-old. ""This Kid Is A Star #SNL,"" tweeted Questlove. ""SNL's new featured player @petedavidson stole the whole show tonight during Weekend Update!""

"(CNN) -- Some mobile and Web users got a disconcerting warning on Wednesday when digital alerts incorrectly showed a tsunami may be headed toward the coast. A National Weather Service message, that was meant as a test, instead appeared on the service's website and was pushed to mobile apps that rely on it for information. AccuWeather's app was among those that sent a tsunami warning to users in parts of California and Washington. ""AccuWeather sent out an automatic alert to our App users, -- a programmed message to get this warning out as quickly as possible,"" said Evan Myers, chief operating officer of AccuWeather. ""We subsequently determined that this was a test message from the National Weather Service and that the warning was not real.""

"(CNN) -- Imagine taking a peaceful flight, gliding along without much noise or any fuel, effortlessly descending into the airport without a trace of emissions. Sounds like a dream? It is. But one we can imagine in the not-so-distant future. E-Fan, the brainchild of parent Airbus Group, is a prototype hybrid electric motor glider which will first be used for training pilots for their license at a school in Bordeaux, France, by 2017. It debuted with its first public test flight in April 2014, and the two-seater electric aircraft is powered by two batteries, producing 60 kilowatts of power, which will be able to run for half an hour. The E-Fan has been a continuous journey of evolution, says chief technical officer Jean Botti. ""This is a learning curve to get to the big ones in the future."" It started five years ago when Airbus Group experimented with the Cri-Cri, a tiny plane based on the 1970s Cri-Cri, one of the smallest twin-engine planes in history. Besides the benefits of noise and emissions reduction, the reduced cost of training pilots with the E-Fan is incredible, says Botti. It costs about two cents per hour to fly the electric plane, a number which is up to 20-50 times cheaper than the normal fuel costs of today's aircraft, he says. Ultimately, these savings will get passed on to the customer, explained Botti, as the electric-powered flight training becomes a reality. What's ahead for electric? Eventually, the company has its eye on building planes for regional flights, with up to 90 people flying for three hours, although this is still 15-20 years away, says Botti. ""We're not talking about replacing the A380,"" he says. But the shorter-term goals also include helicopters with hybrid electric technology. For Airbus Group, much of the investment is being mobilized by the European Commission's ""Flightpath 2050"" which aims to cut aircraft CO2 emissions by 75%, and noise levels to be reduced by 65% from their 2000 levels. The goal is to make tens to hundreds of these planes, and Airbus Group says it will be designed by schools with apprenticeship programs in order to help raise up the new engineers of tomorrow. The biggest challenge for E-Fan is developing new energy storage. ""We cannot afford to stay with the state of batteries today. We need to go much higher in terms of efficiency,"" says Botti, adding that the company's new research center in Munich, Germany, will have the capacity to do just that. Alternative planes take off . It's not just Airbus looking to alternative aircraft to help save energy, cut fuel consumption and reduce noise. There are several others developing alternative aircraft with their own success. Recently, the Solar Impulse 2, a fully solar-powered aircraft, was unveiled by a Swiss duo which will attempt to fly non-stop for 120 hours without any fuel next year. Made of carbon fiber, its predecessor, Solar Impulse, smashed aviation records as it succeeded in the first solar-powered overnight flight, lasting 26 hours in 2010. Another creation is the Dutch-designed, German-built Antares 23E, an electric aircraft with 23-meter wings which can glide for 60 kilometers (37 miles). The Antares 23E can climb to 3,500 meters on a single battery charge.","Electric hybrid motors signal a greener, quieter flight path .

"Beijing (CNN) -- In recent years Halloween has become a big deal in Beijing, with locals and foreigners hitting up dozens of themed parties around the city in their wackiest costumes. Some, however, seek out something truly macabre -- an authentic haunted house. Among the freakier options in the city is a building simply called ""no. 81."" Unlike your average haunted house, found hidden in some dark alley or unlit street, this one sits on one of Beijing's busiest thoroughfares -- Chaoyangmen Inner Street. The area is famous for its Western-style clubs, restaurants and concerts. But these days No. 81 has been giving the street a ghoulish boost due to its alleged ghostly residents. Decrepit is kind of scary . ""The only word to describe that house is 'decrepit',"" says Guo Tao, a former resident of the neighborhood. ""The broken windows, the crawling ivies ... not many people want to stop at that place."" The building has grown in infamy. Beijing taxi drivers have no trouble finding it when you tell them you're looking for the haunted house on Chaoyangmen. Numerous mentions online have made it a popular site for young adventurers. ""I came here to celebrate my birthday,"" said a middle school girl visiting the building last week. ""Almost all of my friends have been here, and I thought it would be nice to come here for some fun, especially as Halloween is approaching."" With theme parks getting more expensive, more young people are opting to get a ""free ride"" in the city's old, broken buildings, ignoring 'Danger! Do not enter' signs in the front. Next to the ""danger"" sign at No. 81, there's a more intriguing handwritten warning on a window pane: ""There are ghosts."" Is the place even haunted? Building no. 81 was built in 1910 to serve as a language center and rest area. When the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949, administrative departments moved in and used the building for offices. Local resident Guo says that in the 2000s, the building was abandoned due to a lack of funding. Over the last decade, it's deteriorated to its current state, giving the building an eerie edge that's led many to assume -- or hope -- that it's haunted. Where do the ghost tales come from? Various accounts are making the rounds, but the commonly accepted yarn has it that a number of people have unexpectedly died on the property, including workers, adventure-seekers and other innocents who for some reason or other made their way into the building. Spooky as it all sounds, a recent Xinhua state-run news agency interview with local police attempted to clear up the rumors, saying no deaths were reported to have ever taken place in the building. Meanwhile, the company that currently owns the building told Xinhua that its famously haunted space isn't actually haunted at all. Ghosts or no ghosts, for young adventurers the place is still a spooky destination -- especially around Halloween. ""I heard the building is going to be demolished or renovated soon,"" said one student who recently visited the site. ""I'm not sure if it's true, but I really wanted to take a look before it changes."" Not freaky enough for you? Other ghoulish options in the Chinese capital include a haunted walking tour or the Beijing ghosts tour.

"(CNN) -- What we know -- and psychiatrists have diagnosed for decades -- as schizophrenia may really be eight separate diseases, research published in The American Journal of Psychiatry suggests. Scientists at Washington University in St. Louis analyzed the DNA of more than 4,000 people with schizophrenia. They matched any gene variations they found in the DNA with study participants' individual symptoms. In doing so, they found several ""gene clusters"" that appear to cause eight distinct classes of schizophrenia, according to a statement from the university. ""Complex diseases, such as schizophrenia, may be influenced by hundreds or thousands of genetic variants that interact with one another in complex ways,"" the study authors wrote in their introduction. ""Genes don't operate by themselves,"" Dr. C. Robert Cloninger, one of the study's senior authors, explained in the statement. ""They function in concert much like an orchestra, and to understand how they're working, you have to know not just who the members of the orchestra are but how they interact."" Schizophrenia is a chronic brain disorder that affects about 1% of the population, according to the American Psychiatric Association. Symptoms can vary from hallucinations to disordered speech to attention and decision-making problems. Past studies done on twins and families have shown that about 80% of the risk for schizophrenia is inherited, the study authors say. A study published in July showed as many as 108 genes may be tied to the mental health disorder. But scientists have had trouble identifying specific genetic variations that put people at risk. The Washington University researchers looked at instances where a single unit of DNA was altered, which is known as a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP. Then they identified 42 interactive SNP sets that significantly increased people's risk of schizophrenia, according to the study. In other words, if study participant Bob had Gene Cluster X, he was 70% more likely to have schizophrenia than study participant Fred who didn't have that cluster of genes. In some cases, certain gene clusters were matched with close to a 100% increase in risk. ""In the past, scientists had been looking for associations between individual genes and schizophrenia,"" co-author Dr. Dragan Svrakic said in the statement. ""What was missing was the idea that these genes don't act independently. They work in concert to disrupt the brain's structure and function, and that results in the illness."" The idea that schizophrenia is not one single disorder is not really new, says Dr. Charles Raison, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Arizona. It's similar to the way doctors use the term ""breast cancer"" to describe several different diseases that cause tumors in the breasts. ""Schizophrenia is probably 80 different diseases,"" Raison says. ""All psychiatric conditions likely share this heterogeneity."" There are only so many ways that certain malfunctions in your genetic code can manifest, Raison says. There may be 10 separate gene mutations, but they might only express themselves as one or two symptoms. So what's causing hallucinations in one person might be different than what's causing them in another. So why are scientists trying to separate out the different schizophrenia disorders? Two reasons, Raison says: to help predict who might get schizophrenia, and to help treat it more efficiently. Take, for example, pleurisy, which is a condition where the liquid around your lungs becomes inflamed. Several things can cause pleurisy, including a viral infection, pneumonia or cancer. If you have a drug that treats pneumonia, it's going to help only a certain percentage of patients with pleurisy. But if you know that your patient's pleurisy is caused by cancer, you'll find a different course of treatment. The same could hold true for schizophrenia and other mental health conditions, Raison says. ""In psychiatry land we're still stuck with pleurisy,"" he says. ""They're descriptions of symptoms, and we only have a vague idea of the underlying causes.""","Researchers say schizophrenia is not one disorder, but eight .
Genetic variations cause eight classes of schizophrenia .

"(CNN) -- Paul Revere, leader of the 1960s rock band Paul Revere and the Raiders, died Saturday at his home in Idaho, the band's website reported. He was 76. Revere -- whose birth name was Paul Revere Dick, according to a biography on the Internet Movie Database -- was frontman for the band that often performed in three-cornered hats and other clothing harking back to the Ameican Revolution. Revere was born in Nebraska and played in bands in Idaho and Oregon, according to a tribute on the band website written by Roger Hart, who managed the group in the early days. Hart said he took the band to Hollywood and signed them to a deal with CBS/Columbia Records. The band recorded a string of hits in the 1960s and early 1970s, including ""Kicks,"" ""Hungry"" and ""Indian Reservation."" Revere, the band's organist, had a hyperactive effervescent stage personality and came to be known as ""the madman of rock 'n' roll."" In a tribute on the band's website, a fan remembered seeing the band for the first time. ""My dad took me to a Paul Revere and the Raiders concert in Buffalo NY in April of 1967,"" she wrote. ""I think other than the male acts he was the ONLY man there. He said he was deaf for a week afterward, but he admitted he'd enjoyed the show and the Raiders. The Raiders were always fun and in good taste, parents didn't have to worry."" The band's fame grew as the Raiders appeared on ""Dick Clark's American Bandstand,"" ""Where the Action Is,"" the ""Ed Sullivan Show,"" the ""Tonight Show with Johnny Carson"" and even the ""Batman"" television show, Hart wrote. Revere recognized his debt to Clark. In a CNN.com story, Revere wrote about seeing his mentor six weeks before Clark's death in 2012. ""I gave him a hug and told him everything I have and everything I am I owe to him,"" Revere wrote. The band became a fixture on the oldies circuit in later years and had a tour scheduled to start in November. Revere's cause of death was not disclosed, but Hart said Revere died ""peacefully."" Besides Revere, the original Raiders included Mark Lindsay, Phil Volk, Drake Levin and Mike Smith, the website said. Levin and Smith have died.

"(CNN) -- Two years ago, Dino Mazzetti hit the lowest point of his life. The Lake Zurich, Illinois, middle school music teacher was hovering dangerously close to 300 pounds and was feeling horrible. Pain radiated in every joint in his body because of his weight. ""I could barely bend over to tie my own shoes,"" the 29-year-old wrote on CNN iReport. If he dropped something on the floor at school, he had to ask a student to help him pick it up. It was humiliating. Being overweight was not always the norm for Mazzetti. He and his two siblings were slender kids, eating home-cooked meals and playing often outside. But that all changed after Mazzetti became a sophomore in high school in August 2000. He quit the high school football team, and instead joined the school's music and theater programs. Unfortunately, the ferocious appetite he had developed as a football player didn't change. In just a few months, the 5-foot, 10-inch student had grown from 120 pounds to 200. Mazzetti went from eating healthy meals at home to buying school lunches that consisted of French fries, pizzas and mozzarella cheese sticks. He would wash those greasy meals down with a 32-ounce soda, which he would get from the school's soda dispenser that he visited multiple times a day. As a teenager, he was making his own food choices, and those choices consisted of mostly junk. By the time he went to college in 2003, Mazzetti was obese. Some people even called him the ""Big Mac Attack"" because he would eat a Big Mac in four bites, ""just to prove I could,"" he said. After graduating college in May 2007, he started a teaching job at Nippersink Middle School as a music teacher and choir director, and his weight only got worse. He was wearing XXL shirts and size 48 pants. His weight climbed to 291 pounds. This was the heaviest he had ever been, and he became self-conscious about it. The teacher dressed himself in loose trousers that stretched around his waist, and wore hefty button-up shirts that made him look like he was in his 40s rather than his 20s. Mazzetti started secluding himself because of his lack of confidence, and turned to food for comfort. ""Being a teacher is a really hard job. It's an emotional job. I think he found solace in eating,"" said Mazzetti's sister Julia, who is an English teacher. ""He told me that he would eat fast food three times a day. He was sitting in front of the TV eating all the time. He would stand in front of the pantry, always looking for something to eat. It looked like an addiction."" By summer 2012, though, Mazzetti realized the lonely nights eating in front of TV were taking their toll. He needed to socialize. He joined a community college theater production of ""Sweeney Todd."" He was cast as Beadle Bamford, the short, greasy and overweight lackey of Judge Turpin. A theater buff, Mazzetti was enthused to get the part, but he discovered it was hard to physically keep up with the rest of the cast on and off the stage. During a cast party to mark the end of the show that summer, Mazzetti joined his fellow actors for a friendly volleyball match. A few minutes into the game, he was already panting and totally exhausted. ""I thought to myself at that moment, 'I'm 27 and I feel like I'm 60!' "" he wrote in his iReport. A scary thought crossed his mind: What would he feel like when he did turn 60? That question nagged him after he left the party. He came home and decided to go on a walk around his neighborhood to get more exercise. It wasn't easy. He was winded within minutes. He knew then that he needed something to change if he wanted to start feeling his age. ""My goal was to get to a point where I felt good,"" he said. June 30 would become another birthday for him: the day he decided two years ago to change his life. He remembered a colleague from school telling him to use the elliptical because it was gentler on joints. Mazzetti took the advice and went to the fitness center at the middle school to give it a try. The pedaling resistance of the elliptical was intense. He broke out in a sweat within minutes. He wasn't a fan, but after spending 30 minutes working out, he decided he would give it another try the next day. ""It took me 15 years to get to where I was. It was surely going to take me more than a couple of days to lose this weight. So I told myself to keep coming back,"" he said. Soon, Mazzetti was working out on the elliptical an hour every day, even on the weekends. He would drive an hour from his home in Lake Zurich to his school's fitness center in Richmond just to work out. He also decided to cut soda out of his diet entirely. He replaced it with carbonated water so he could get the fizziness he loved without the empty calories. He changed his diet, too, cutting out simple sugars like cookies and candies. Instead of eating fast food meals for lunch and dinner, he started cooking big breakfasts in the morning. He would wake up before 5 a.m. and whip up entrees like steak and eggs before jetting off to school. His lunches were medium-sized and his dinners were usually light, like a salad. Everything was home cooked, something he had never attempted before. ""The first time I went to a grocery store, I bought a piece of steak and an ear of corn and I was like, 'I can do this,'"" he said. ""I realized cooking was fun."" He went from ordering nearly all his meals from restaurants to preparing 95% of his meals at home. It didn't take long for him to see drastic changes in his stamina -- and his waistline. By December 2012, he had slimmed down to 200 pounds, a number he hadn't seen since high school. By January 2013, Mazzetti weighed 180 pounds. He was starting to feel less anxious around people. He began motivating his coworkers to exercise with him at school. He also saw big changes in the way his music and choir students interacted with him. They were more engaged and responsive in his class. He was gaining their respect. His family was so inspired by his dramatic weight loss that the whole clan, including Mazzetti, got a gym membership near their home in February 2013. At the gym, Mazzetti got a trainer to help him transition from a weight loss mentality to a weight maintenance mentality. He started lifting weights and allowed himself to eat more carbohydrates so he would have energy for his workouts. ""He just really transformed his whole life,"" Julia said. ""He went from the unhealthiest person in our family to the healthiest. He was hiding himself, in his house, in the food, and that's not who he is."" Today Mazzetti is down to a 32-inch waist. He weighs 170 pounds. He wears fashionable, slim-fitting shirts to show off his slender frame, which is a drastic change from his old school attire of oversized khaki slacks and bland dress shirts. He also lost the comb-over and started growing out his hair to accentuate his newly defined jawline. The trimmed body, smaller clothes and new hair revealed the 20-something hiding underneath all that weight. ""I can honestly say I'm in the best shape of my life,"" he said. His new confidence brought him to the realization that he wanted to pursue a different life path, too. He quit his seven-year teaching career and enrolled in Illinois State University to get a master's degree in choral conducting. But the beloved teacher hasn't been forgotten by his students. His sixth, seventh and eighth graders created a Facebook fan page for him. On the page, one of his students wrote: ""This is a tribute to one of the greatest humans to ever grace this planet. Dino was not only a great director, but a great friend. He's always there to lend a helping hand or a crappy joke, and I thought it was only right to make a group for him."" His newfound confidence has also affected Mazzetti's acting life. In July, he nabbed the lead role as Dr. Frankenstein in the production of ""Young Frankenstein"" by College of Lake County. The dance routines and long rehearsals made it the most physically demanding role he has ever played. ""I would not have been able to do this role if I was not as fit as I currently am,"" he said. ""I usually played characters who did little or no dancing at all."" For him, the key to weight loss was to stay positive. ""You'll be the last person to see the physical changes because of the fact that you see yourself differently than anyone else,"" he said. ""Go for it. Do it. The only person riding the roller coaster of your life is you.""","Standing at 291 pounds, every joint in Dino Mazzetti's body hurt .

"(CNN) -- Some of the world's most well-known companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, Boots and Starbucks have become successful partly by convincing us through their products that their corporate values align with consumers' personal values. But what happens when these companies behave in ways that seem to betray our trust? What if you find out that these companies keep their huge profits offshore and out of reach of domestic tax authorities? Will people challenge them -- ""You want to change the world and have us pick up the tab?"" Yes, people are voicing their discontent. At Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in June, protesters loudly criticized Apple for keeping $54.4 billion offshore to avoid paying U.S. corporate taxes. GE, Microsoft, Citigroup and Medtronic are other high-profile companies have also come under scrutiny and criticism for similar tax avoidance behavior. The fact is that over $2 trillion in U.S. corporate profits is parked offshore. This should infuriate many law-abiding, taxpaying citizens. What's the justice in this? Former Labor Secretary Robert Reich put it aptly when he said that lost tax revenue ""has to be made up by you and me and every other taxpayer who can't afford high-flying attorneys and accountants to shift our income into places with low taxes."" Of course, the companies don't see it that way and deserve a hearing. For them, it's a difficult business dilemma. The U.S. is alone among developed nations in requiring double taxation for corporations. U.S.-based companies face a 39% corporate tax rate -- the highest in the developed world -- and are required to pay tax twice on foreign profits: once to the country in which the revenue was made, and a second time to the U.S. if and when the money is brought back. Corporations say they keep so much profit offshore because they have a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders to maximize profits by any legally allowed means, including avoiding taxes. Meanwhile, consumers watch critically as companies play out their tax avoidance strategies -- from protecting foreign profits to actually moving their headquarters to other countries. Apple, for example, has an extremely proactive corporate tax avoidance strategy that allowed the company to pay an effective tax rate of 12.6% -- one of the lowest among U.S. corporations. Seventy percent of Apple's profits -- and $54.4 billion in earnings -- are allocated overseas through subsidiaries in countries with much lower rates (like Ireland and the Netherlands) and out of the grasp of U.S. tax authorities. Repatriating Apple's offshore money would cost the company about $18.4 billion and increase its effective tax rate to 33.8%. Citigroup would have had to pay $11.7 billion in additional U.S. taxes had it brought back $43.8 billion in 2013. Other companies choose to move to avoid paying taxes or receive a lower tax rate. Medtronic, which makes medical device technology, plans to move its headquarters to Europe after a merger with Covidien, a non-U.S. company. Medtronic will then enjoy a corporate tax rate much lower than in the U.S. The trend among large companies these days to embrace social responsibility and transparency leads people to expect them to behave, well, more responsibly. So it is ironic that some of the biggest companies are shirking taxes on their profits. But people notice. Advocacy groups in the UK and U.S. are targeting tax-avoiding companies by personalizing the impact of lost tax revenue in terms easy for citizens to rally around. The group US Uncut has pointed out that Apple's fair share of U.S. tax on offshore profits in 2011 could have paid salaries for 90,000 teachers. Boots' $1.2 billion revenue sheltered from UK taxation could have funded salaries for 85,000 nurses at the National Health Service. As Ralph Nader and Cesar Chavez showed us in the 1960s, activist voices can galvanize consumers and fuel them with the spirit of populism. People with a tangible target for their general financial dissatisfaction may equate these companies -- and business leaders -- with the glaring inequality of our time. In a recent Politico piece, Seattle's billionaire investor Nick Hanauer warned that Americans may one day come after the tech and money plutocracy with pitchforks. History shows that it's impossible for the very wealthy to predict when consumer unhappiness can boil over into outright upheaval. He predicts that moment is coming. Companies that are out of sync with their consumers' values -- even in their legitimate self-interest -- are at risk of having a center that cannot hold over time. That could be detrimental to their business in the long term. In Britain, for example, Starbucks saw a 29% drop in the company reputation score, from +3 to -26, after a Reuters report that showed the chain paid no tax on 1.2 billion pounds in sales and claimed to have made no profit in Britain after 14 years of operations. That probably wasn't the smartest move. Companies that try to hide their profits, through whatever loophole, risk testing the goodwill of consumers. More and more, young people care about a company's values. More than half of the millennials recently surveyed by PricewaterhouseCoopers said they would consider leaving an employer if its social responsibility and values no longer matched their own. Millennials are important to the growth of any company, as consumers and as prospective employees. Companies that spend millions to control their images and public narratives by being in touch with consumers may end up being perceived as out of touch if they keep avoiding paying taxes. Consumers may not storm the barricades and topple Apple stores, or forgo their morning coffee, but they will crave economic justice, and they will press for changes.","Big brands like Apple, Starbucks put their profits offshore to lower their tax bills .

"(CNN) -- On her way to pick up her New York City Marathon bib number Friday, longtime New Yorker Lauren Mandel was having second thoughts of running in the iconic race. Just four days after Superstorm Sandy hit her city, she was wracked by a knot in her stomach as she got closer to the convention center serving as the hub for race participants. ""Walking past ... generators heating up tents for people to eat pasta tomorrow night when there are people who haven't eaten a hot meal in five days"" left her with the feeling: ""This is so inappropriate and this is so wrong,"" she said. Those feelings of outrage echoed across the city and nationwide since Wednesday, when Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the race would go on as scheduled. The announcement sparked a chorus of criticism from local authorities and residents, inspired a boycott effort on Facebook, and became a trending topic on Twitter as users called for the race's postponement. And after the public outcry grew close to deafening Friday, city and race officials announced they would cancel the race for the first time in its 42-year history. ""While holding the race would not require diverting resources from the recovery effort, it is clear that it has become the source of controversy and division,"" a statement from the mayor said. NY Marathon 'was going to be divisive,' says deputy mayor of cancellation . First held in 1970, the New York City Marathon attracts about 47,000 runners and 12,000 volunteers. An estimated 2.5 million spectators typically line the course, which winds through all five city boroughs. But it was the starting line in Staten Island -- one of the areas hardest hit by Sandy -- that drew much of the criticism. At least 20 people on the island were killed in the storm, which left homes in shards and large portions of neighborhoods under water. Residents on Staten Island pleaded Wednesday for gas, food, and clothes. One woman said she had eaten one slice of pizza in the past two days. U.S. Rep. Michael Grimm, who represents Staten Island and Brooklyn, said before Friday's announcement that the city had its priorities wrong. ""We're still pulling bodies out of the water and the mayor is worried about marathon runners and returning to life as normal,"" Grimm said in a statement. ""The Verrazano Bridge should be used for getting fuel and food in to Staten Island, not getting runners out."" A series of photos of the island's devastation went viral Friday. The post by BuzzFeed ended with the line: ""The NYC Marathon is still scheduled to run on Sunday."" Meanwhile, a group of runners scheduled to participate in the race started a boycott page on Facebook, vowing to wear their bib numbers while they volunteered in recovery efforts on Staten Island. And Friday's cover of The New York Post also weighed in on the controversy. A simple, but powerful, headline over a photo of two generators read: ""Abuse of Power: These massive generators are providing electricity to the marathon's tent in Central Park while NYers suffer!"" The response to the cancellation announcement was immediate: . ""Canceling the NYC Marathon was 100% the right decision,"" Parth Desai tweeted. Karim Lebhour was set to run in the race and said that while he was ""disappointed"" with the decision, he admitted ""nobody really was in the mood."" Crippled NY subways spark infrastructure, climate questions . San Francisco-based runner Dean Karnazes also said canceling the race ""was the right thing to do."" ""I'm going to stick around and help out. Now is a time to lend a hand, not run,"" he tweeted. The ""Boycott the 2012 NYC Marathon"" Facebook group echoed Karnazes' comments, saying the volunteer effort in Staten Island will go forward Sunday in the wake of the cancellation. Other Twitter users began sharing a link to Race2Recover.com, which is encouraging runners to donate their hotel rooms to displaced residents. But some runners, especially those who traveled from outside the United States to participate in the race, were frustrated by the last-minute cancellation of an event in which not everyone is guaranteed a bib. To guarantee a spot in the race, runners must pledge to do the event for charity or qualify with a fast marathon or half-marathon time. For the majority of the race participants, they're in by being one of the lucky ones chosen in a random drawing. ""It's a huge frustration,"" said Juan Carlos Arevalo, who traveled from Argentina. ""It really is an effort to come here and participate."" Neil Robbins flew in from Scotland on Thursday, planning to run the race to raise money for cancer research. Now he'll be spending the next week in New York. ""I tried my best. I did my training. I came across, but unfortunately ... Sandy has put an end to my dream,"" he said. ""But such is life. I'll try again next year, maybe."" Wednesday, in announcing his decision to move forward with the race, Bloomberg said ""an awful lot of small businesses"" depend on the annual event. Powerless in New Jersey . On Thursday, the mayor brushed aside concerns that the marathon would direct crucial resources away from recovery efforts, saying electricity would be restored by race day, thus freeing up police currently manning intersections where the traffic signals and electricity have gone out. ""To host the New York City Marathon in the middle of what is complete devastation and a crisis in parts of this city is just wrong,"" said City Councilman Domenic Recchia, whose south Brooklyn district includes Coney Island and other areas that suffered heavy damage. Bloomberg continued his fight for the marathon early Friday, recalling another time when city officials were forced to make a tough decision during a sensitive time. ""As Rudy Giuliani said to me this morning, he said, 'You know, right after 9/11 people said exactly the same thing.'"" Bloomberg said, adding, ""You have to keep going and doing things and you can grieve, you can cry and you can laugh all at the same time. That's what human beings are good at."" City and race officials met throughout the week, up until Friday afternoon, weighing their options including considering whether to postpone the race or shorten the course. In the end though, ""it was clear that this was not going to be a celebration of New York,"" said Deputy Mayor Howard Wolfson. ""It was going to be a divisive, difficult day instead of a day of celebration."" Shortly after 5 p.m., the cancellation announcement was made. Mike Denton, a New Yorker who was set to run the race, said he was looking forward to the opportunity to ""use this as a way to build some energy and kind of remind myself why New York is awesome."" Now, he said, five months of training is ""for nothing."" New York after Sandy: A tale of two cities . Others expressed concern for the economic implications of canceling such a huge revenue-generating event. Olympic marathoner and former New York City Marathon champion Paula Radcliffe said on Twitter that the city needs ""the solidarity, the lift, and the economic boost that Marathon Sunday brings to NYC."" Tony Ruiz, a running coach with the Central Park Track Club, said Thursday that the consequences of canceling ""would be very severe and possibly hurt the city even more, and certainly hurt economically."" The marathon is also an important fund-raiser for hundreds of charities who recruit runners to raise funds, and they stand to lose their pledged donations, said Lee Silverman, president of JackRabbit Sports, a running gear retailer that works with many of those charities every year. More than $34 million was raised in 2011 by runners doing the race for charity, according to the marathon website. New York Road Runners, which puts on the marathon every year, said it is donating $1 million to the Hurricane Sandy Relief Fund and encouraged others to donate as well. After getting over the shock of the race's cancellation, Denton said he and his team will put away their running shoes Sunday and put on their work gloves as they join the volunteer effort. Mandel, for her part, ended up leaving the race expo before hearing the news that the event had been canceled, having already made up her mind that she would not run this year.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama made his final pitch for his prized piece of legislation -- health care reform -- on Capitol Hill on Saturday, and Democratic leaders decided to abandon a plan to avoid a direct vote on the Senate bill. President Obama told Democrats on the eve of Sunday's historic House vote: ""Let's get this done."" ""If you agree that the system is not working for ordinary families, if you've heard the same stories that I've heard everywhere, all across the country, then help us fix the system,"" Obama said. ""Don't do it for me. Don't do it for Nancy Pelosi or Harry Reid,"" he said. ""Do it for all those people out there who are struggling."" Obama's speech came just hours after Democratic leaders decided to abandon the controversial legislative mechanism know as ""deem and pass"" to avoid a direct vote on the health care legislation. They will now hold an up-or-down vote on the $875 billion reform plan that the Senate has already passed. Multiple Democratic sources told CNN that Democratic leaders decided to drop the proposed tactic, which had come under fierce criticism. The sources said the House will have three votes Sunday -- a vote on the terms of debate, a vote on compromise changes to the Senate bill, and then finally, a vote on the Senate bill itself. ""We have been debating health care for decades,"" Obama said. ""It has now been debated for a year. It is in your hands. It is time to pass health care for Americans and I am confident that you are going to do it tomorrow."" If the Senate bill passes the House, Obama will sign it into law. If the package of changes is passed, it will be taken up by the Senate. Freshmen House Republicans railed Saturday against the bill. ""The health care decision should be made between a patient, their family and their physician,"" said Rep. Phil Roe of Tennessee. ""Not the insurance company, not the federal government. And this is a great intrusion by the federal government in that decision-making process."" Democratic leaders are trying to round up the 216 necessary votes to pass the bill. According to CNN's latest count, 33 Democrats plan to vote against the legislation. Thirty-eight Democratic ""no"" votes are needed to kill the bill. Multiple Democratic leadership sources told CNN that Democrats have more than 200 ""yes"" votes, though it was not clear Friday night how close Democrats were to securing the votes they need. iReport: Share your thoughts on the health care bill . One undecided congressman said Friday that he refused to answer a phone call from the White House until he finalized his voting decision. On Saturday, Texas Rep. Henry Cuellar released a statement saying he has ""decided to stand in support of this plan for health care reform."" Administration officials claim that the reform plan has been picking up momentum in recent days. They told CNN they had a ""really good day"" Thursday, when the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that the compromise plan would cost $940 billion over 10 years while reducing the deficit by $138 billion -- $20 billion more than the bill passed by the Senate. The budget office numbers reassured some fiscally conservative Democrats, according to congressional leaders. ""Not only does it reduce the deficit, we pay for it responsibly in ways that the other side of the aisle -- that talks about fiscal responsibility but doesn't seem to be able to walk the walk -- can't claim when it comes to their prescription drug bill,"" Obama said Saturday in a jab at Republicans. House Minority Leader John A. Boehner countered the president: ""Democratic leaders are telling their members after this passes, it's going to become much more popular. Well, they're dead wrong."" ""This is not the way to go, and the American people know it."" iReport: Health care protests at the Capitol . If enacted, the measure would constitute the biggest expansion of federal health care guarantees since the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid over four decades ago. It would extend insurance coverage to an additional 32 million Americans, according to a preliminary analysis from the budget office. Republicans contend the plan amounts to a government takeover of the private insurance system that will do little to slow spiraling medical costs. Obama addressed those concerns Saturday, insisting there is no government takeover. ""We are making sure that the system of private insurance works for ordinary families,"" he said, calling the legislation a ""patient's bill of rights on steroids"" and ""the toughest insurance reform in history."" Republicans argue it would lead to higher premiums and taxes for middle-class families while resulting in deep Medicare cuts. Among other things, the plan would expand Medicare prescription drug coverage, increase federal subsidies to help people buy insurance and ban denials of coverage for pre-existing conditions. It seeks to bridge the gap between previous House and Senate bills partly by watering down and delaying the implementation of a tax on high-end insurance plans. Republicans are fuming over the Democrats' decision to use a legislative maneuver called reconciliation, that will allow the compromise measures -- if passed by the House -- to clear the Senate with a simple majority of 51 votes. Senate Democrats lost their filibuster-proof 60-seat supermajority in January with the election of Republican Sen. Scott Brown of Massachusetts. Republicans contend that reconciliation, which is limited to provisions pertaining to the budget, was never meant to facilitate passage of a sweeping reform measure such as the health care bill. Democrats point out that reconciliation was used to pass several major bills in recent years, including George W. Bush's 2001 and 2003 tax cuts. House Democrats have expressed concern that the compromise measures will not be approved by the more conservative Senate. Pelosi said Friday, however, that ""when our members go to vote, they will have all the assurances they need"" that the Senate will approve the compromise plan. Meanwhile Saturday, a Tea Party protest against the bill was held in Washington. ""We want this bill stopped,"" organizer Jennifer Hulsey said. ""This is not what the American people want, and our congressmen and our congresswomen need to listen to the American people because they really mean it this time."" Democratic lawmakers say they've faced slurs . A group of Republican congressmen, including Reps. Steve King of Iowa and Jack Kingston of Georgia, emerged Saturday night to address the protesters who chanted ""Kill the bill!"" throughout the speeches. ""Our fight is not over,"" King told the crowd over a bullhorn. ""You represent what is good and right about America. We will fight this bill until we completely defeat the government takeover of your personal liberty.""","President Obama visits Capitol Hill for final pitch on health care overhaul .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court's decision Monday on same-sex marriage brought the issue back into the political mix less than a month before the midterm elections. Deciding not to weigh in on the debate, the high court refused to hear cases in five states that are trying to maintain their same-sex marriage bans. That move effectively cleared the way for same-sex couples to legally wed in Oklahoma, Utah, Virginia, Wisconsin and Indiana. Only one of those five states, Virginia, has a contested U.S. Senate race this year. But the decision Monday also means that six other states who are covered by the same circuit appeals courts could also soon see their bans struck down. Of those states, three -- Colorado, Kansas and North Carolina -- are home to big Senate races. All told, 30 states could soon start permitting same-sex marriage. That's up from 19 before the Supreme Court decision. Polls show acceptance . It's instinctual to think that such a vast change on a hot-button issue could throw a wrench in an election year, especially with less than a month before Election Day. But recent polls and the gradual state-by-state legalization of same-sex marriage indicates that it's no longer the wedge issue it once was. Sure, vulnerable Southern Democrats -- like Sen. Mary Landrieu in Louisiana and Kay Hagan in North Carolina -- may be wary of letting social issues become a prominent force in the midterms, as they tend to galvanize conservative bases. But those socially conservative, pro-traditional marriage bases are getting smaller. A CBS/New York Times survey last month indicated that 56% of Americans believe same-sex marriage should be legal, representative of a slew of polls in recent years that show growing acceptance of the issue. ""As a general rule, it won't have an effect on these midterms because I think the issue is fading,"" said Quentin Kidd, director of the Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University in Virginia. ""Millennials are becoming an increasingly larger portion of the electorate, and boomers are becoming an increasingly smaller part,"" he continued. ""And millennials feel very different about it than boomers do."" Conservatives: issue will dominate election . Some social conservative leaders, including Ralph Reed of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, vowed that same-sex marriage would dominate the midterms. ""For candidates running in 2014 and those who run for president in 2016, there will be no avoiding this issue,"" Reed said in a statement, taking issue with what many critics described as judicial activism by the courts. While Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said conservatives are right to be outraged by the courts' action on the issue, he doubts same-sex marriage will become a big force in the elections next month. ""People... are right to be concerned about what's happened here, but it doesn't mean it's the issue every single morning that we're dealing with in regards to these midterms,"" he said on MSNBC. How it plays in Virginia . Republican Ed Gillespie, who's challenging Democratic Sen. Mark Warner in Virginia, said the Supreme Court's decision has ""considerable impact"" but did not express overt concern about the issue. ""I've always felt that this is a matter for the states to determine,"" he told CNN affiliate WSLS. ""I don't believe that the federal government should set policy relative to marriage. I think the states should. And, obviously, given the court's ruling, it is the law of the land today."" With half of Virginia voters supporting same-sex marriage, according to a Quinnipiac poll earlier this year, a Republican candidate running for a statewide seat would almost need to take a measured approach on the issue. Warner, his opponent, endorsed same-sex marriage last year along with several other Senate Democrats. On Monday, his Twitter account was fully supportive of the Supreme Court's move, calling it a ""truly historic day."" If a Republican like Gillespie were to utilize the decision as a campaign issue, the candidate would need to micro-target a segment of voters that is highly passionate about it, Kidd said. ""If he can link his passion against same-sex marriage with the right voters, then I think that can help him gain support,"" Kidd added, but he doubts it can actually push Gillespie over the edge. Colorado candidates' views . In Colorado, Republican Cory Gardner -- who's angling to oust Democratic Sen. Mark Udall -- has yet to comment on the Supreme Court decision. The candidates were not asked about it in their debate Monday. And with Colorado voters supporting same-sex marriage, 61%-33%, according to a Quinnipiac poll in April, it's no surprise that Gardner may keep quiet on the issue. Public opinion, however, makes it easier for Udall, who quickly took to Twitter Monday to blast out his support. ""Supreme Court is right to let 10th Circuit Court decision â€” & others across nation â€” for #MarriageEquality stand. #MarriageMomentum,"" his account read. No comment in North Carolina . Over in North Carolina, where Republican Thom Tillis is working to unseat Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan in the most expensive race this year, neither candidate has commented on the decision. Hagan was part of the surge of Senate Democrats who endorsed same-sex marriage last year, but North Carolina passed its same-sex marriage ban as recently as 2012 -- an effort that Tillis, speaker of the North Carolina House, helped push. According to the Charlotte Observer, Hagan reiterated her position Monday. ""I've made my personal opinion on this clear,"" she said. ""I opposed Amendment One, because I don't think we should tell people who they can love or who they can marry."" Same in Kansas . The issue could also come up in Kansas, another one of the six extra states affected. Republican Sen. Pat Roberts, who supports a constitutional amendment to define marriage between a man and a woman, is fighting for his political survival against an independent candidate, Greg Orman. And in a state with large patches of conservative voters, neither of those candidates are commenting either. CNN's Bill Mears and Ashley Fantz contributed to this report.","NEW: RNC chairman says same-sex marriage won't be a top 2014 issue .

"(CNN) -- Wales coach Warren Gatland considered faking an injury to one of his players during Saturday's 9-8 Rugby World Cup semifinal defeat to France, the New Zealand-born coach revealed at a press conference Tuesday. Wales had already lost prop Adam Jones to injury before being reduced to 14 men when captain Sam Warburton was issued a red card after 18 minutes, following a dangerous tackle on France wing Vincent Clerc. Gatland, 48, admitted the Wales coaching staff discussed feigning an injury to one of their props in the wake of Warburton's dismissal, a move which would have meant scrums were uncontested for the remainder of the contest. ""We had already lost Adam Jones,"" said former All Blacks hooker Gatland. ""And we discussed in the box, did we fake an injury to one of our props to go to uncontested scrums. France beat 14-man Wales to reach World Cup final . ""But morally, I made the decision that wasn't the right thing to do. We could've easily done that in the first 25, 30 minutes of the game. ""But in the spirit of the game, the spirit of a World Cup semifinal, I didn't think that was the fairest or the right thing to do."" Gatland also disputed the decision to issue Warburton, 23, with a red card, only the second of the tournament so far, in such a crucial match. ""I honestly believe Alain Rolland (the Irish match referee) made the wrong decision. I think the right decision was a yellow card. ""In terms of the rules and the regulations, he's perfectly entitled to give a red card but every game is different. You've got to take circumstances, the situation, the intent ... given his experience, a yellow card was the right decision to make."" Rugby union's governing . All Blacks down Wallabies in last-four clash . Despite Wales' defeat, Gatland reaffirmed his commitment to the country after reports in the British press suggested he could replace 2003 World Cup winner Martin Johnson as England coach. ""I'll be honest, at some stage in your rugby career, as I'm a Kiwi, I'd like to come home and do a bit of coaching in New Zealand,"" Gatland, who is contracted to Wales until the end of 2015, told the tournament's official website. ""But not at the moment and I have made that commitment to Wales. We feel like we've shown a lot of character, we feel like we've played some great rugby since we've been here. ""We'll leave here with our heads held high having earned a lot of respect."" Wales face two-time world champions Australia in the bronze medal match on Friday, after the Wallabies were beaten 20-6 by hosts New Zealand in the second semifinal on Sunday. Warburton will miss the clash at Auckland's Eden Park, with prop Gethin Jenkins set to replace him as Wales captain. Jones also misses out due to the injury he picked up during Saturday's loss, with Paul James set to cover at prop. Lock Alun-Wyn Jones makes way for Bradley Davies in the only other change.","Warren Gatland admits considering faking injury ar Rugby World Cup .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- ""Iron Man 3"" has set a new box office record in China, taking 130 million yuan ($21 million) on its opening day. The appeal may have something to do with additional scenes added into the Chinese version of the film. The extra four minutes of footage feature product placement for a Chinese-branded milk drink and two new characters, Dr Wu and his assistant, played by top Chinese actors Wang Xueqi and Fan Bingbing, respectively. Gitesh Pandya, editor of BoxOfficeGuru.com, described the scenes as ""borderline propaganda"" in an interview with CNN's Andrew Stevens. But the inclusion of the scenes, he said, gave the film access to the Chinese market that other Hollywood studios lack. The Walt Disney Company and Marvel Studios teamed up with Beijing-based DMG Entertainment for the third installment of the Iron Man series. DMG Entertainment is also a co-distributor in China, where some filming took place. With China surpassing Japan as the world's second largest movie market last year, studios that successfully appeal to Chinese audiences can reap sizeable profits. But navigating around the country's censorship and other restrictions has proved a challenge for some. READ MORE: Iron Man passes $300 million internationally . When ""Red Dawn"" was released in China last year, a scene showing an invasion by Chinese forces was changed to the North Korean army, and a shoot-out scene set in Chinatown in ""Men in Black 3"" was cut entirely. ""The American studios are desperate to get into China,"" said Pandya. ""And they're looking for new ways to profit from this growing market. The population of just the middle class alone is much bigger than the entire United States population, so there's tremendous potential there."" Pandya predicts the movie's gross profits in China will reach well over $100 million. Robert Downey Jr. spoke of his fascination with Chinese culture during a promotional tour for the film in Beijing last month. ""I'm interested in all things Chinese and I live a very Chinese life in America,"" he said. Globally, ""Iron Man 3"" has already raked in more than $300 million since it premiered in London on April 18. The film opens in the U.S. on Friday.

"(CNN) -- The family of Jules Bianchi, the Formula One racing driver who was critically injured at Sunday's Japanese Grand Prix, have revealed that he is suffering from a ""diffuse axonal injury."" It is a potentially devastating type of brain injury which causes widespread tearing of nerve fibers across the whole of the brain, according to the UK brain injury charity, Headway. The 25-year-old Marussia driver remains in a critical but stable state, his family said in a statement released via the F1 team's official Facebook page. ""Jules remains in the Intensive Care Unit of the Mie General Medical Center in Yokkaichi. He has suffered a diffuse axonal injury and is in a critical but stable condition,"" the statement said. ""The medical professionals at the hospital are providing the very best treatment and care and we are grateful for everything they have done for Jules since his accident."" The Frenchman sustained his injuries after coming off the track and colliding with a recovery vehicle that was removing Adrian Sutil's Sauber car -- the German driver had skidded off the track at turn seven moments earlier in a rain-affected race. ""This is a very difficult time for our family, but the messages of support and affection for Jules from all over the world have been a source of great comfort to us. We would like to express our sincere appreciation,"" the statement said. ""We are also grateful for the presence of Professor Gerard Saillant, President of the FIA Medical Commission, and Professor Alessandro Frati, Neurosurgeon of the University of Rome La Sapienza, who has travelled to Japan at the request of Scuderia Ferrari. ""They arrived at the hospital today and met with the medical personnel responsible for Jules' treatment, in order to be fully informed of his clinical status so that they are able to advise the family.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- China has removed 162,629 ""phantom staff"" from government payrolls, as Beijing presses on with a campaign against official corruption and misuse of public money, state media reported. Hebei province in central China was the worst offender, with 55,793 officials found to be getting paid even though they never worked, followed by Sichuan and Henan, state news agency Xinhua reported on Monday. No ""phantom employees"" were found in Shanghai and Tibet, the report added. President Xi Jinping has made rooting out corruption a top priority since taking power amid widespread suspicion that government officials use their position for personal gain. The People's Daily also said that 114,418 official vehicles had been scrapped out of a total of 119,846. China has promised to phase out the use of government vehicles by the end of 2015, except for those used for emergencies and law enforcement. The news reports did not shed light on how employees could receive a paycheck without showing up for work, but Hong Kong-based commentator Frank Ching said it was not unheard of for senior Chinese officials to employ friends and family members.","China says it has removed 162,629 ""phantom staff"" from provincial government payrolls .

"Washington (CNN) -- Hillary Clinton is at the top of every 2016 poll. She is crisscrossing the country picking up sizable speaking fees and addressing audiences who cheer any mention of her future plans. And nearly every analyst has her as the likely Democratic nominee next time around, should she run. While Clinton's closest advisers are trying to keep supporters from anointing her the inevitable nominee - for fear it will create a backlash among grassroots voters - they are losing that fight in part because some Americans, especially Democrats, want to be a part of history. A Gallup poll Friday showed that 18% of Americans surveyed said Clinton becoming the first woman president would be ""the best or most positive"" thing about her winning the election. It was cited by 30% of Democrats and 17% of independents. Breaking the Glass Ceiling . ""Potent is an understatement. Is there a word stronger than potent?"" said Dan Mahaffee, the director of policy at the Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress, when asked about the potential impact on the electorate of Clinton becoming the first woman president. ""There certainly is that dynamic for there to be a historical president, to feel part of that is certainly a strong driver,"" he said. When Barack Obama ran for president -- defeating Clinton for the Democratic nomination -- a strong, but far from the only aspect of his draw was the history of electing the first black president. A similar case could be made for Clinton, who regularly talks about women getting into politics and the importance of electing the right first woman to the White House. Nathan Gonzales, deputy editor of The Rothenberg Political Report, echoed Mahaffee, saying ""people want to be a part of history"" even though some would like to believe that elections are driven by issues and differences between candidates. Gonzales said electing a woman would crash through another glass ceiling. ""I think voters could be driven by this sense of history,"" he said. Finding that Clinton becoming the first woman president would be the ""best"" thing about her winning in 2016, the survey also found that number outpaced all other factors in the open-ended question. Nine percent of people said her experience would be the best, while 3% said her competence, 2% said her intelligence and 2% said the fact that Bill Clinton would be back in the White House. ""From the American public's perspective, Hillary Clinton's greatest selling point going into the 2016 presidential election, should she decide to run, would be the historic fact that, if elected, she would be the first female president in the nation's history,"" wrote Frank Newport, editor in Chief of Gallup. Clinton not helping inevitability fight . For her part, Clinton has fed this inevitability. The former senator made it clear when she halted her 2008 primary campaign: She was proud of the ""about 18 million cracks"" - the number of people who voted for her - that her campaign put into the glass ceiling of electing a women president. Clinton proclaimed that ""the light is shining through [the ceiling] like never before, filling us all with the hope and the sure knowledge that the path will be a little easier next time."" Those comments are put into a different context considering Clinton is actively mulling another run at breaking that ceiling. Female participation in politics and business has become a part of nearly every speech Clinton delivers. In Florida, she talked about the importance of women in leadership positions; in Vancouver, she looked to inspire women to get involved and participate, and Tuesday in Montreal, the former first lady talked about the benefits of having more women in politics. ""Having people get out of their comfort zones and think about being somebody's shoes - or high heels - as the case may be, gives you a broader view,"" she said, adding that more women in politics is better for the United States political system. ""I believe that there can be and hopefully will be differences by having more women in these positions,"" Clinton said, noting that ""of course it depends on who the women are."" Clinton told the audience that while she hadn't yet made up her mind on 2016, she has ""a deep sense of commitment to my country and its future."" Not just about being a woman . For Marcy Stech, spokeswoman for Emily's List, the historic factor of a possible Clinton presidency is obviously a draw to Democratic voters. ""We see right now that there is an overwhelming excitement in battleground states to elect the first woman president,"" said Stech, whose group runs Madam President, a program to elect a woman president. ""There is a clear desire among Democrats to break that glass ceiling."" But to Stech -- and others -- Clinton's inevitability is more than just Americans looking to elect a woman. ""We know that voters don't support women candidates just because they are women,"" Stech said. Instead, she added that voters tend to see women as more focused on problem solving and more likely to work with people who they may disagree with. Mahaffee agrees with Stech. ""There is such a talent and resume gap between her and everyone else that is even potentially being floated and it is even shocking to think that one of those people is the sitting vice president,"" added the historian. Even according Clinton, electing a woman just because she is a woman is not the right way to vote. When asked during a question and answer session of an appearance at UCLA whether it was important for the United States to elect a female president, Clinton quickly and bluntly said, ""Well, the right female president, yes.""","Possibility of electing the first woman president important for many Americans, survey shows .

"Hong Kong, China (CNN) -- A woman celebrating the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to a Chinese dissident has been charged with assault for accidentally splashing champagne on a security guard outside the Chinese central government's liaison office in Hong Kong. ""The officer walked up as I was opening a bottle of champagne and he was splashed,"" said Ip Ho-yee, 22. ""It was a minor incident. I never guessed that opening a bottle of champagne would lead to this."" Ip, who was arrested Sunday afternoon, made her comments in Cantonese. The security guard was not injured, but he made a complaint, so Ip was arrested and charged with common assault, said Hong Kong police spokesman Lawrence Li. ""This is an absurd case,"" said Law Yuk-kai, director of Human Rights Monitor, a group based in Hong Kong. ""This just shows who's the boss,"" Law said, referring to the mainland Chinese government. The British returned Hong Kong to China in 1997, with China's promise that Hong Kong could continue to govern itself for the next 50 years. But critics of Beijing say the mainland government has encroached on Hong Kong residents' rights and interfered with the special administrative region's government. Ip was released on her own recognizance and is to appear before police in late November, said the police spokesman. She and others were celebrating the Nobel victory of Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo, who is serving an 11-year prison sentence after repeatedly calling for human rights and democratization. Liu was sentenced in 2009 for inciting subversion of state power. He is the co-author of Charter 08, a call for political reform and human rights, and was an adviser to the student protesters at Tiananmen Square in 1989. The Norwegian Nobel Committee awarded the prize to him on Friday. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said the awarding of the prize to Liu was ""blasphemy against the peace prize"" that could harm relations between China and Norway. The Nobel Committee stood by its choice and said it had expected China to react strongly. ""We have a very strong tradition of awarding the prize to human rights activists of many different kinds,"" Geir Lundestad, director of the Nobel Institute, told CNN. ""This is a tradition we are very proud of, and this is a tradition for which the Norwegian Nobel Committee has received much applause,"" Lundestad said. ""We felt that if we were serious about this tradition, we did have to come to terms with the question of China in this perspective, and this is what we then did this year."" A record 237 names were submitted for the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize, the Nobel committee said. Thirty-eight of the nominees are organizations.

"(CNN) -- College football's top-ranked LSU Tigers defeated the No. 2 Alabama Crimson Tide 9-6 in overtime Saturday night. LSU won the coin toss in overtime, electing to start on defense. The Crimson Tide's offense sputtered in the extra session with two incomplete passes, a penalty for having 12 men in the huddle and a sack for a 5-yard loss. Cade Foster, Alabama's placekicker, who had already missed three field goals earlier, missed another from 52 yards out. After that, LSU marched down the field, nearly scoring a touchdown but running back Michael Ford stepped out of bounds. Big game a work of heart . LSU elected to attempt a field goal and Drew Alleman-- who kicked two field goals earlier -- hit the 25-yard game-winner. The game, before a Bryant-Denny Stadium crowd in Tuscaloosa, mainly witnessed field goals and punts. Neither team scored a single touchdown. The low score might be surprising, given that the teams totaled 45 points in 2010, 39 in 2009 and 48 in 2008. The game was the first-ever SEC regular season game matching the country's two top teams, which were undefeated going into play. Both teams were among the nation's best when it came to defense and Saturday's game was no exception with LSU notching a field goal in the last seconds for a 3-3 tie going into halftime.

"(CNN) -- It's been almost 15 years since ""The Baby-Sitters Club"" held its last meeting, when author Ann M. Martin decided it was time to move beyond Kristy, Claudia, Mary Anne, Jessi and their friends from the popular book series. But Martin has continued to write about adolescent experiences, from first loves to dyslexia and bullying. Her latest book, ""Rain Reign,"" out Tuesday, is told from the perspective of a fifth-grader with high-functioning autism. Rose Howard is obsessed with homonyms, prime numbers and following the rules -- something her teachers, classmates and single father don't understand. She feels most at ease around her dog, Rain, but everything changes when a superstorm hits their small town and Rain disappears. ""Rain Reign"" isn't the first time Martin has included autism in one of her books, but it was a new experience for her to write using the first-person voice of a child with autism. Below is a transcript of our interview with Martin, edited for brevity and clarity. CNN: Where did you get the idea for ""Rain Reign""? Ann M. Martin: I would say that it's been a long time in the making. The character of Rose has been percolating for a while, but the very beginnings of this story go back decades to the 1970s when I was in high school and college. I was fascinated with autism, and I began working the summers at a school in Princeton, New Jersey, for kids with autism. The interest has never left me. I minored in special education when I was in college. I wrote twice before about kids with autism but never from the point of view of the person with autism. Rose was the first one, and I just could almost hear her voice in my head, and her obsessions and idiosyncrasies were becoming clearer and clearer to me. My editors Jean Feiwel and Liz Szabla and I had been talking about my writing another dog story. We had talked about a superstorm in some way because here in Ulster County (New York), where I live, we were hit incredibly hard by Hurricane Irene. It was very devastating in this area. All of these things came together at the same time -- a dog story, Rose and the storm -- and eventually the pieces came together. CNN: How did you develop Rose's voice? Martin: I thought it was going to be difficult. When I wrote ""A Dog's Life,"" which was the first dog story I wrote, I had to experiment for a long time. It was told from the point of view of Squirrel, a dog, and I had to do quite a bit of experimenting with her voice before I settled on it. Rose's voice seemed to come to me more naturally. I think already knowing what her obsessions were, not only homonyms but prime numbers and rules, helped because her interests crept into her voice and helped shape it. So it wasn't as challenging as I had thought it was going to be. CNN: Rose details her favorite homonyms throughout the book. What is your favorite homonym? Martin: I have a lot, because I am just almost as interested in homonyms as Rose. The more different the spelling is for a pair of homonyms, the more interesting it is to me. One of my favorites that Rose discovers and mentions towards the end of the book is ""soared"" and ""sword."" CNN: What did you enjoy most of working on ""The Baby-Sitters Club"" series? Martin: Once I found a rhythm and developed the characters, I liked not having to say goodbye to them at the end of each book. On the other hand, by the time I wanted to end the series, I really felt it was time. I had told everybody's stories as well as I wanted to, and it was finally time to say goodbye and let them graduate from eighth grade. I also wanted to spread my writing wings and try different things, write in different time periods. I think we all felt it was time to end the series. But I love hearing from adults who read ""The Baby-Sitters Club"" books as children. CNN: You worked with other writers on ""The Baby-Sitters Club"" series after the demand became too great and sent them outlines for future BSC books. What was that process like? Martin: I really enjoyed it. I had been an editor before I became a full-time writer, so this was like putting my editorial hat back on. I am a huge outliner. I outline everything. The authors that my editors, and I chose to write the other books in the series were people who either I had worked with or the editors had worked with before and we felt that they could continue the voice of the characters. We kept the number of other writers very small to try to maintain this consistent voice for the series, and each of the authors had read all of the books in the series up to the point from which they would be writing so they would have the background. I trusted the writers we had chosen, and I felt that we worked really well together. I almost didn't have a choice, because there is no way I could have written all those books myself! I felt that this was the best of both worlds because I couldn't do it myself, but this was the schedule that Scholastic wanted, so it became what I thought was a very nice group effort. CNN: What do you think of the status of middle school fiction right now and where it's going? Martin: It is different from where it was when I first started writing. There is more fantasy, more sci-fi adventure and vampires, and I think it's interesting. I have a feeling in a few years, things will take a turn. The most important thing is, as long as kids are interested and turn into readers, especially avid readers, I think that's fabulous. Most kids become eclectic readers, which is great, and that's my hope for any reader, to find things that they love and hopefully those will lead them to other things. CNN: You've tackled a lot of different issues in your books. What are some other things you'd like to cover in the future? Martin: I would like to think maybe about writing fantasy in the near future. I've touched on it when I write the ""Doll People"" books with Laura Godwin, but she is the one with more of a handle on writing fantasy. So to write fantasy, even a light fantasy, would be a real challenge. I was thinking more in that direction than touching on another issue, which is not to say I won't do it; I just haven't been thinking about it. When I was growing up, some of my favorite books were light fantasy, like the ""Doctor Dolittle"" books, ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" ""James and the Giant Peach"" and ""Mr. Popper's Penguins,"" but for whatever reason when I began writing, the stories were much more realistic. So, I think it would be fun to tackle fantasy on my own.","Ann M. Martin's latest book, ""Rain Reign,"" hits shelves Tuesday .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Last week, China unveiled a list of wide-ranging reforms to the ""gaokao"" -- the hyper-competitive and grueling college entrance examination that represents most families' best shot at the Chinese dream. Chinese media have hailed these reforms as a panacea to China's education woes: The poor will have a better shot at a top school, and students won't feel so stressed out all the time. However, as someone who's either observed or worked in Chinese education since 1999, I believe that unless the government decides to cancel the gaokao, no systemic reform will matter. According to the State Council, English is no longer mandatory. Students must take the Chinese and math exams, but they can choose the other four subjects to be tested, and they can take these examinations separately (much like the Advanced Placement system in the United States.) Colleges can no longer recruit artists and athletes, a system that has been prone to abuse. Finally, universities are encouraged to increase their quota of students from the poor inland provinces, and to make public their quotas. Education liberalized . To understand China's current education system, we have to go back to 1999. That's when former Premier Zhu Rongji decided to liberalize the housing and education markets. Government subsidies to Chinese universities were cut, forcing universities to increase tuition and student enrollment. The effect of this change was dramatic: in 1991, only 4% of the cohort of Chinese college-aged students attended universities; today, according to ministry of education statistics, it's about one quarter. To meet this demand for a college degree, vocational colleges were folded into universities, universities were merged to create super-universities, and super-universities built satellite campuses. This decision had severe consequences for how Chinese parents perceive education, and how employers perceive university degrees: . 1.) With a glut of university degree holders flooding the marketplace, employers began demanding university degrees for jobs that previously only required vocational training. This puts even more pressure on families to send their only child to college. 2.) This means that a university degree is severely diluted, and middle-class families feel that it's no longer enough to send their child to university -- he or she must get into a ""key"" or, best of all, a ""top ten"" university in China. 3.) This has led to an escalating arms race in which families put pressure on their child to succeed from day one. In China, there's now a considered track for academic success: Students get into the best elementary schools, which then secures them a place in the best junior high schools, which allows them to test into the best high school,s which gives them the best shot at testing into a top university. If students fall off this elevator to success at any point, they are considered ""lost."" The gaokao system is essentially a lot of people trying to push each other away so that they can squeeze into the door of elite college admissions. It doesn't really matter if you paint the door a different color or call the door a different name or let certain people jump the line -- it's still a door with limited space, and you'll still have tiger moms and dads who will fight tooth and nail to make sure their kid gets through the door. This system is what economists like to call a zero-sum game, and explains why children are so sleep-deprived and stressed-out, and why parents must flatter and bribe teachers. So, in essence, China's new gaokao reforms are just window dressing. What's more, China's wealthy and well connected are opting for a new system outside the gaokao, enrolling their child in private bilingual schools and overseas high schools and colleges. Those who cannot pay their way are forced to continue in a system that promises the destruction of their child's childhood, curiosity, and creativity. What should be done . Rather than try to dress up its system of narrowing doors, the Chinese government should better serve the people and the nation by concentrating resources on building ladders. Even if no one can say it aloud, the socialist dream of educational equality is dead and buried, and to move forward China needs to adopt a system of social mobility. That means a Finnish-style early childhood education program in which poor rural children as young as eight months old are given access to daycare to address deficiencies in nutrition, literacy, and emotional stability that can plague them in their adult lives. That means a strong German-style system of vocational training to provide the rural poor real marketable skills so they no longer have to sweat and grunt in the fields and factories. And that means building a system of community colleges and continuing education programs to permit laborers to upgrade their skill sets and work towards a college degree. Any of these three initiatives would be real and significant education reform in China. And together, they'd give those who most need it a good shot at the Chinese dream. The opinions expressed here are solely those of Jiang Xueqin.","China unveils reforms to ""gaokao""-- the grueling college entrance examination .

"(CNN) -- A fast-moving wildfire destroyed at least 20 homes near Guthrie, Oklahoma, on Sunday -- one of several fires to break out amid unseasonably high temperatures and windy conditions in the state, officials said. The Guthrie blaze was about four miles long and up to a mile wide, and was burning a largely rural area, Logan County Sheriff's Office Chief Deputy Richard Stephens told CNN. ""It's growing so fast it's pretty hard to estimate,"" Stephens said. ""There are a lot of cedar trees, they have a lot of oil in them and they just explode."" Guthrie Fire Chief Eric Harlow put the fire's size at between 3,000 to 4,000 acres. No injuries were reported, but some firefighters and residents were overcome by the heat and smoke while fighting the fire, Harlow said. Those people were treated at the scene. People were trying to evacuate a large number of livestock, according to Stephens. The fire was the largest of several in the state that are being fueled by temperatures in the 90s and high winds, according to Keli Cain, spokeswoman for the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management. ""They got three ingredients for a bad fire: high temperatures, high winds, and low humidity,"" said Daryl Williams with the National Weather Service in Norman.","The fire near Guthrie is one of several to break out in the state .

"ST. PAUL, Minnesota (CNN) -- A group of gay and lesbian Republicans has traveled to the site of the GOP convention this week to help convince its party that it is time to stop being on the ""wrong side"" of the same-sex marriage issue. Log Cabin Republicans President Patrick Sammon says ""momentum is on our side."" ""Clearly, the tide is turning,"" said Scott Tucker, communications director for the Log Cabin Republicans. ""It's important for the Republican Party to be inclusive on this issue, because we are at risk of being on the wrong side of history."" Although the group's president, Patrick Sammon, acknowledges that few politicians in either party support ""marriage equality,"" as the group dubs the same-sex marriage issue, ""it's clear momentum is on our side."" Sammon and other Log Cabin Republicans pointed to a poll indicating that the party is starting to move closer to their positions. A CBS News/New York Times poll released Monday found that 49 percent of the delegates to the Republican convention support allowing same-sex marriages or civil unions. The poll's margin of error is plus or minus 3 percentage points. A CNN/Opinion Research Poll conducted in May found that nearly half of those surveyed supported either same-sex marriages or civil union. Twenty-four percent supported same-sex marriages, while 27 percent backed civil unions. Forty-three percent backed neither option. The poll's margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage points. Despite his opposition to same-sex marriage, the Log Cabin Republicans said they endorsed Sen. John McCain, the GOP's presumptive Republican presidential nominee, on Tuesday because he embraces an approach to politics they want their party to return to. McCain is an ""inclusive Republican who believes that our party needs to get back to our core unifying principles that lead us to victory in the '90s,"" Tucker said, noting that the Arizona Republican has had a long relationship with the Log Cabin Republicans. ""He's a very inclusive Republican, a different type of Republican,"" Sammon said ""At the same time, we have honest disagreements on some issues."" In making its endorsement, the group pointed to the Arizona senator's opposition to a federal constitutional amendment that would have defined marriage as being a man and a woman. The amendment has strong support from social conservatives and would have reversed the decisions by Massachusetts, California and New Jersey to allow same-sex marriages. ""That took a lot courage for a senator from a red state to buck his own party,"" Tucker said. Although McCain personally opposes same-sex marriage, he voted against the amendment, in part, because he believes the issues should be left to the states. ""John McCain stood up for us ... and I want to stand up for John McCain,"" said David Valkema, a director of a fine arts foundation in Chicago, Illinois. ""He doesn't care about my sexuality. He cares that I am an American. ""He's teachable,"" Valkema added. Despite her positions on gay rights issues being largely unknown, Sammon said, the Log Cabin Republicans were also satisfied with McCain's choice of running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. Unlike McCain, Palin has expressed support for the Federal Marriage Amendment, but Sammon said the group was comfortable with her being on the Republican ticket because of her 2006 decision to veto a bill that would have banned the state from providing benefits to same-sex partners of employees. ""She's a great choice,"" Valkema said. ""We're learning more every day, but what we know, we like."" Although Palin was as blank slate for the Log Cabin Republicans, the group was extremely happy that McCain did not choose Mitt Romney, a former Massachusetts governor and presidential candidate who was often mentioned as being on McCain's short list of vice presidential choices, Tucker said. While on the campaign trail, Romney often railed against his home state's decision to allow same-sex marriages. ""We would have had a problem ... if Sen. McCain would have chosen someone who used gay people as a wedge issue,"" Tucker said.","Log Cabin Republicans say support for same-sex marriage, civil unions increasing .
Group endorses Sen. John McCain, touts his ""inclusive"" politics .

"(CNN) -- Novak Djokovic has claimed a fourth Miami Masters title after an emphatic straight sets win over his old rival Rafael Nadal at Crandon Park. The Serb was at his ruthless best in Sunday's final wearing down the world No. 1 to win 6-3 6-3 in one hour 24 minutes. The title was Djokovic's 43rd of his career and follows his recent triumph at Indian Wells where he beat Roger Federer in three sets. It was the 40th time Djokovic and Nadal had met during their careers and while the Spaniard still has the edge overall -- 22 wins to Djokovic's 18 -- the Serb has now extended his advantage on hard courts to 14-7 against Nadal. What was expected to be a close match ended up being one-way traffic as Djokovic outplayed his opponent. Parity lasted for five games before the world No. 2 broke serve in the sixth. Realizing the danger, Nadal redoubled his efforts in the next, taking Djokovic to deuce before the Serb stepped up a gear to open up a 5-2 lead. It was too much for Nadal to recover and when the Spaniard lost his serve in the opening game of the second, the match could have slid away more easily than it did. The world No. 1 stuck at his task but in the end couldn't find a way through Djokovic's watertight defenses. Scenting victory Djokovic pounced in the ninth game, attacking Nadal's serve and setting up match two points. He completed proceedings in style getting the upper hand in a stunning final rally before collapsing in celebration. ""It's been a fantastic tournament, a very enjoyable time as it always is in Miami,"" said Djokovic. ""I played a great match, from the start to the end everything was working really well. It's always a challenge and a pleasure to play against Rafa. ""Back in 2007 I won my first big title here in Miami and I have the greatest memories from this center court."" Djokovic didn't drop a set (although he did have two walkovers) in winning his third Miami title in four years while Nadal is still searching for a first after finishing runner-up for a fourth time. Hingis doubles joy . There was joy for Martina Hingis earlier in the day as she won the women's double title alongside partner Sabine Lisicki from Germany. The pair overcame Russia's Ekaterina Makarova and Elena Vesnina 4-6 6-4 10-5 in Sunday's final. Hingis, 33, made the most of hers and Lisicki's wild-card entry to Miami after returning to doubles action at Indian Wells earlier this month. The win is Hingis' third in the doubles at Miami -- she won in 1998 and 1999 wth Jana Novotna -- and her first for seven years.

"(CNN) -- Two people were executed Tuesday in China for their part in a tainted milk scandal that killed at least six babies and sickened about 300,000 others, state-run media reported. Zhang Yujun was executed for endangering public safety and Geng Jinping was executed for producing and selling toxic food, the Xinhua news agency said. The tainted formula came to light in September 2008, after several babies fell ill from drinking formula that contained melamine. Melamine is commonly used in coatings and laminates, wood adhesives, fabric coatings, ceiling tiles and flame retardants. Some Chinese dairy plants added the chemical to milk products so they would appear to have a higher protein level. The tainted milk caused kidney stones and urinary tract problems in hundreds of thousands of children. The 22 Chinese dairy producers that made the formula have offered compensation to victims' families. In all, 21 people were tried and sentenced in January for their roles in the scandal, Xinhua reported. Among them, Zhang and Geng were sentenced to death, and most others received at least 15 years in prison.","Zhang Yujun and Geng Jinping executed for their roles in toxic milk scandal .

"(CNN) -- Growing up, I wanted to be Too Tall Jones, the Hall of Fame defensive end for the Dallas Cowboys. The way I saw it, I already had the last name. And I was oversized, much taller than the other girls -- and the boys for that matter. So in my mind I was Too Tall. No one could tell me different. It made me feel special to walk around the neighborhood with that nickname. Too Tall was a superstar. So I was, too -- and not just the gangly girl some people saw trying to find her way. My scruffy friends and I would play tackle football for hours in a dusty patch behind my building. And I would charge the field, screaming with unbridled joy, crushing anything in my path. No pads. No flags. No rules. Getting injured? Nobody worried about such nonsense. But those days are long gone. Today, though few things bring me greater joy than football, I am at a crossroads. It's obvious we need new rules to save the game and protect players. No one can ignore the mounting medical evidence that brain damage sustained in football, as well as other contact sports, is linked to serious health problems, including depression, dementia, suicide and death from respiratory problems. The discussion has even reached the White House. Last week, President Obama weighed in, urging the NCAA to address the serious health hazards in the college game. This week, the NFL players union announced it has given Harvard University a $100 million contract to conduct a 10-year study on concussions and other health issues associated with the game. For me, it is not only a question of whether the multimillionaire NFL pros are being protected. You don't have to be a sports insider to understand that the tragic death of Junior Seau and the serious health problems of many retired NFL players demand changes in the way football is played. There really is no choice. But football is also putting our kids in danger. Research, such as a study done by Boston University School of Medicine, has identified serious brain damage, or CTE -- chronic traumatic encephalopathy -- not only in the autopsied brains of professional football players but in at least one high school player's brain as well. More than ever before, parents are terrified of putting their boys on the field and, understandably, refuse to let their kids play football. Even Obama, a big football fan, told The New Republic that if he had a son, he would ""have to think long and hard"" about whether he would let him play, because of the potential of getting injured. And those parents who allow their kids to play football want safer rules and better oversight. ""My son was kickoff returner. I couldn't even watch."" said Paige Hockman, whose oldest boy was a star player at Vestavia Hills High, a public school outside of Birmingham, Alabama. ""You are watching 11 huge boys fly downfield and their goal is to kill your child, just to knock a ball loose. It's the scariest part of the game. If anything could be done on the kickoff where the momentum (would be) slowed down, I would be all for that,"" she said. ""Maybe we could do away with the kickoff completely."" Hockman is a football mom. She understands well that even a small rule change, such as eliminating the kickoff, might cause a nationwide revolt. But she also knows her job is to keep her boys safe. When her 10th-grader, a lineman at Vestavia, was recently sidelined for more than two weeks with a concussion after a dirty hit in practice, his mother didn't panic. She is confident that the school is following the stringent injury policy mandated by the state of Alabama. But Vestavia Hills High is rare. It is a well-funded school district where most of the parents are college-educated, Hockman said. The football team has a trainer and team doctor, who regularly communicate with parents. Other players and families might not be as fortunate. ""It's very different in Podunk, Alabama, schools, where parents and coaches are less educated and more concerned about winning than safety for the children,"" Hockman said. ""I hate to say it, but economics make a big difference. They don't do things the right way in those schools."" Ex-NFL stars after concussions: Lives unraveled . Football's a dirty, dangerous game. It's never been for the fainthearted, and that's part of the appeal. But in order to save the game, and stop parents from steering their kids away from the gridiron, new rules are necessary. The game will have to be safer to attract future generations. Change might have to come first from the ranks, where parents' impact is still greater than that of big-money TV deals and wealthy alumni boosters. Change may come from schools like Vestavia Hills High, or even from the Pop Warner organization, the nation's oldest youth football and cheerleading program, where an estimated 250,000 kids play football across the country. Pop Warner's executive director, Jon Butler, is taking safety more seriously these days, thinking of new rules and creative ways to better train volunteer coaches. His organization created a medical advisory board of neurologists and neurosurgeons to examine how to avoid and detect concussions. It has decided to immediately take any child with a head or neck injury out of the game, and to require a doctor's note to allow that child to play again. The group has set limits on how long each player can stay in a game and how much contact is allowed during practices. Coaches cannot spend more than a third of practice time in full speed contact. And no full-speed drills can start more than three yards apart. Butler envisions a time when brain scans will be mandatory each season for all children who want to play football. He wants to use this technology to identify kids who are most susceptible to brain injuries. And those players, he said, would be directed to other sports with less contact and fewer collisions. Good luck selling those ideas to the NCAA or the NFL and its player unions -- or even some parents. But I think Butler is headed in the right direction. He's putting player safety first. Call me silly, but I think a kid should be able to dream about becoming an NFL star playing in the Super Bowl -- a safe Super Bowl. Who knows? She might just become a superstar on her own field on the way to the Big Game. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Roxanne Jones.","Roxanne Jones has always loved football, but says it's time to recognize its risks .

"Washington (CNN) -- A day before the United States observes Martin Luther King Jr. Day, park rangers placed wreaths at the Washington memorial honoring the civil rights leader. Members of King's family stood beside the towering 30-foot statue of him as crowds sang ""Happy Birthday"" at a ceremony Sunday. ""We're celebrating the best of what we are, but also what we must become, knowing that we've not arrived there yet,"" Martin Luther King III said. The civil rights leader's son said his father would have turned 83 Sunday, if he had survived the 1968 shooting that killed him. On his last birthday, in January 1968, Martin Luther King Jr. was planning a ""poor people's campaign"" to bring together Americans from all walks of life to demand ""decent jobs with decent pay,"" his son said. ""He did not live to see that come to fruition, and so, 44 years later, we're still challenging our nation, particularly in light of the fact that there's so much poverty rampant in this nation,"" Martin Luther King III said. Among the many visitors at the memorial was Bill Janocha, from Stamford, Connecticut, who had traveled to Washington with a Boy Scout troop. ""He brought beautiful things to our country,"" he said about the elder King. ""He ... was a monument ... so all the tributes that we can give him are certainly just."" The Martin Luther King Jr. memorial in Washington opened to the public last year. Sunday's ceremony came several days after officials confirmed that a controversial quote on one side of the monument would be corrected. The line currently reads: ""I was a drum major for justice, peace and righteousness."" The quote, which holds a prominent place among more than a dozen King's most notable lines at the site, sparked controversy last summer when poet Maya Angelou said it made the civil rights leader appear arrogant. King's original words, from a 1968 sermon at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, were: ""If you want to say that I was a drum major, say that I was a drum major for justice. Say that I was a drum major for peace. I was a drum major for righteousness. And all of the other shallow things will not matter."" Photos: Remembering MLK at his home church . Angelou said that leaving out the ""if"" changes the meaning. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar has given the National Park Service 30 days to consult with the Martin Luther King Jr. National Memorial Project Foundation, members of the King family and others to decide on a more accurate version of the quote, an official at the Interior Department said last week. King's son said Sunday that he supported the move, because future generations may not know the context of the quote. ""The context is what I think people have questioned, and understanding and knowing who my father was, it could be confusing. For us today, no, but for generations yet unborn, they may not understand,"" he said. ""But I'm sure that when this is done, that everyone who comes will understand who and what Martin Luther King Jr. meant in terms of what he said about himself.""","""He ... was a monument,"" a visitor says about the civil rights leader .

"(CNN)  -- Once again, the nation is outraged that school bullying has claimed another victim. As news spread about the indictment of nine teens who are accused of relentlessly bullying 15-year-old Phoebe Prince to suicide this year, parents everywhere asked: ""How could this have happened? Where were the adults?"" I couldn't help but wonder why it always takes a tragedy to get the world's attention. The suffering of millions of students all across America, some of whom are being bullied as badly as Phoebe and who have been crying out for help day after day, semester after semester, should be enough. Why are their voices not heard? What message are we sending these lonely, frustrated kids: that they might as well suffer in silence, because no one's going to take notice unless someone ends up dead? I know what Phoebe felt as she walked the halls as a freshman at a Massachusetts school, listening to the jeers and whispers, praying she could make it to homeroom or math class in one piece. I know the terror that descended over her like a dark cloak every time the bell rang, signaling the beginning of the school day. And I also know that as much as she must have hated her classmates for what they were putting her through, it was what they were denying her that hurt even worse: someone to sit with at lunch, the invitations to hang out on weekends and after school, the girl talk and giggles exchanged between trusted friends, the simple joy of fitting in. Before long, it pokes holes in your soul, and you can feel self-loathing start to fill in those empty spaces. I know because, from fifth grade through high school, I was the target of relentless bullying for much the same reason Phoebe and so many other students are: simply for being ""different."" I was threatened, beaten, dragged across parking lots, burned with lit cigarettes, teased, taunted and spat upon at lunch, mocked in gym, snickered at in class, ambushed at sleepovers and spit-balled on the school bus. My adolescence was a living hell, and it wasn't the acceptance my classmates withheld that caused the deepest anguish; it was all the love and friendship I had to give that no one wanted. After a while, it backed up into my system like a toxin and poisoned my spirit. I can only imagine what Phoebe was thinking as she took her last breath on this Earth. I suspect that it was one word, the same word that haunts every bullied student. ""Why?"" While I mourn this young girl's loss with my whole heart, none of us can do anything for Phoebe now. But it's not too late to save the next one and the hundreds after that and then the thousands after that. That's something we can do. And make no mistake. What happened at Phoebe's school is not rare. It is far more common than you may realize. For the past eight years, since my memoir ""Please Stop Laughing At Me ..."" was released, I've been touring schools across the country, sharing my story to motivate change. When I go into a district, I do a daylong program that involves a student presentation, a teacher workshop and an evening parent/family seminar. From rural communities and inner-city neighborhoods to affluent suburbs and small towns, I've spoken at hundreds of schools and held in my arms thousands of bullied kids, who come up to me after my student presentations with horror stories of their own about how their classmates are treating them. When I ask whether they've confided in a teacher or counselor, many of them say that they've reached out for help repeatedly and that ""no one's doing anything."" It's not that these schools don't care or that they're in denial. They wouldn't have gone to the trouble or expense of bringing me in to speak if that were the case. But no school, no parent and no child can solve the problem of school bullying on his or her own. It requires a synergistic approach, one in which each person is equally committed to making a difference. Here's how you can help: . If you're a student, remember that it's not just joking around. Bullying people can damage them, and you, for life. Bullying is not just the mean things you do, it's all the nice things you don't do, like letting someone eat alone at lunch or ignoring people as if they're invisible. It doesn't take an overt act of cruelty to diminish someone's spirit. Simply never making the effort to include them in anything can be just as hurtful. Tomorrow at lunch, ask someone whom you wouldn't ordinarily reach out to to join your table. If you're an educator, be vigilant. Pay attention to what's happening around you, not just in front of you in the classroom. And if you see a child struggling to belong, take action, talk to your principal, ask the school counselor to intervene, talk to the parents -- get involved and, most important, stay involved. If you're a parent, recognize that your bullied child's spirit is bleeding from loneliness and you need to find an interim social life for him or her that will buy you the time to deal with the larger issues, such as working with the school and addressing the parents of the bullies. Contact the park district and local library in the nearest next town over that does not feed into your child's school district. Ask them to send you a list of their organized activities for kids. Have him choose one and then enroll him. This will give your child something to look forward to on those especially lonely days, and it will refresh the spirit. If you've been a victim of peer abuse like me, turn your pain into purpose. Share your story at schools, PTA meetings, teacher in-services, anywhere they're willing to listen, and offer wisdom and insights from your own experiences. Good luck, everyone. I know you can make a difference. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jodee Blanco.","Jodee Blanco was so bullied at school, she has dedicated her life to stamping it out .

"(CNN) -- HIV has returned in two patients who doctors hoped had been cured of the virus following bone marrow transplants, the Boston researcher who treated them said Saturday. The HIV virus became undetectable in both patients approximately eight months after the transplant. The men remained on antiretroviral therapy until the spring of 2013. ""The return of detectable levels of HIV in our patients is disappointing, but scientifically significant,"" Dr. Timothy Henrich, a researcher at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, said in a statement. ""We have demonstrated HIV can be reduced to undetectable levels by very sensitive research assays and the virus persists."" The virus became detectable in one patient in August -- 12 weeks after ceasing antiretroviral therapy. In the other man, HIV became detectable this month, 32 weeks after antiretroviral therapy ceased. ""Through this research we have discovered the HIV reservoir is deeper and more persistent than previously known and that our current standards of probing for HIV may not be sufficient to inform us if long-term HIV remission is possible if antiretroviral therapy is stopped,"" Henrich said. ""We have also learned that there may be an important long-lived HIV reservoir outside the blood compartment."" Dr. Daniel K. Kuritzkes, another researcher at Brigham and Women's Hospital, said the cases demonstrate that the virus may persist even when there is no evidence in the blood. ""We need to develop better and more sensitive tools to detect the virus as we continue to pursue novel strategies for HIV eradication,"" he said. ""Our results also show that the immune system can play a major role in reducing the viral reservoir, but may not be able to do the job alone. It is likely that a combination of drugs and immune therapies that target the reservoir will be needed to establish long-term remission of HIV infection."" In July, when the cases were first reported at the International AIDS Society Conference in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, experts stopped short of calling the two cured and said the treatment is not a viable option for the majority of HIV patients. After the patients ceased antiretroviral therapy, they were tested for HIV every seven to 10 days. Both resumed antiretroviral therapy after the virus was detected. They are in good health and the virus is suppressing as expected. Brigham and Women's Hospital researchers will continue to monitor the patients and measure their HIV levels as part of a new study of the very early initiation of antiretroviral therapy after HIV rebound. The men, whose identities were withheld, had been on antiretroviral drug therapy for years before being diagnosed with lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph nodes. Both underwent intensive chemotherapy followed by bone marrow transplants to treat the cancer. They remained on antiretroviral therapy. Approximately four months after the transplant doctors were still able to detect HIV in their blood, but six to nine months later, all traces of the virus were gone. Some patients make it up to eight weeks before the virus returns, but the virus returns eight to 10 weeks after therapy is stopped in the vast majority of patients, Henrich said in July. Not so for these two men, however. HIV discovery 'will change your life forever' The two men were compared with Timothy Ray Brown, also known as the ""Berlin Patient."" Brown is thought to be the first person ever ""cured"" of HIV/AIDS. In 2007, Brown had a stem cell transplant to treat his leukemia. His doctor searched for a donor with a rare genetic mutation called CCR5 delta32 that makes stem cells naturally resistant to HIV infection. Today, the virus is still undetectable in Brown's blood, and he is still considered to be ""functionally cured."" A functional cure means the virus is controlled and will not be transmitted to others. The stem cell transplant procedure, however, is very dangerous because a patient's immune system has to be wiped out in order to accept the transplant. Using a stem cell transplant to treat HIV is not for most patients, and only 1% of Caucasians -- mostly Northern Europeans -- and no African-Americans or Asians have the CCR5 delta32 mutation, researchers say. The transplant is still not a practical strategy for the majority of HIV patients, and the risk of mortality is up to 20%, Henrich says. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, agreed. ""This is not a practical approach for someone who does not need a stem cell transplant since the transplant and its preparation and its subsequent need for chronic immunosuppression is a risky procedure,"" Fauci said. ""If you have an underlying neoplasm (tumor) like these patients had, then the risk outweighs the benefit,"" he said. ""However, if you are doing well on ARVs and you merely want to get off antiretroviral therapy, then the risk seems greater than the benefit."" HIV 'cure' in toddler offers 'global hope' Even though the two patients showed a reduction of the virus in the blood, it could still be in some tissue -- the brain or gastrointestinal tract, for instance, Henrich said. Earlier this year, researchers said an HIV-positive baby in Mississippi was given high doses of three antiretroviral drugs within 30 hours of her birth, with doctors hoping that would control the virus. Two years later, there is no sign of HIV in the child's blood, making her the first child to be ""functionally cured"" of HIV. The Foundation for AIDS Research, or amfAR, helped fund the study. ""These findings clearly provide important new information that might well alter the current thinking about HIV and gene therapy,"" said amfAR CEO Kevin Robert Frost. ""While stem cell transplantation is not a viable option for people with HIV on a broad scale because of its costs and complexity, these new cases could lead us to new approaches to treating, and ultimately even eradicating, HIV."" ""Dr. Henrich is charting new territory in HIV eradication research,"" said Dr. Rowena Johnston, amfAR vice president and director of research. ""Whatever the outcome, we will have learned more about what it will take to cure HIV. We believe amfAR's continued investments in HIV cure-based research are beginning to show real results and will ultimately lead us to a cure in our lifetime.""

"(CNN) -- So now we know -- there won't be a Neanderthal moving into your neighborhood. Despite a lot of frenzied attention to the intentionally provocative suggestion by a renowned Harvard scientist that new genetic technology makes it possible to splice together a complete set of Neanderthal genes, find an adventurous surrogate mother and use cloning to gin up a Neanderthal baby -- it ain't gonna happen anytime soon. Nor should it. But there are plenty of other things in the works involving genetic engineering that do merit serious ethical discussion at the national and international levels. Some thought that the Harvard scientist, George Church, was getting ready to put out an ad seeking volunteer surrogate moms to bear a 35,000-year-old, long-extinct Neanderthal baby. Church had to walk his comments back and note that he was just speculating, not incubating. Still cloning carries so much mystery and Hollywood glamour thanks to movies such as ""Jurassic Park,"" ""The Boys From Brazil"" and ""Never Let Me Go"" that a two-day eruption of the pros and cons of making Neanderthals ensued. That was not necessary. It would be unethical to try and clone a Neanderthal baby. Why? Because there is no obvious reason to do so. There is no pressing need or remarkable benefit to undertaking such a project. At best it might shed some light on the biology and behavior of a distant ancestor. At worst it would be nothing more than the ultimate reality television show exploitation: An ""Octomom""-like surrogate raises a caveman child -- tune in next week to see what her new boyfriend thinks when she tells him that there is a tiny addition in her life and he carries a small club and a tiny piece of flint to sleep with him. The downsides of trying to clone a Neanderthal include a good chance of killing it, producing a baby that is seriously deformed, producing a baby that lacks immunity to infectious diseases and foods that we have gotten used to, an inability to know what environment to create to permit the child to flourish and a complete lack of understanding of what sort of behavior is ""normal"" or ""appropriate"" for such a long-extinct cousin hominid of ours. When weighed against the risks and the harm that most likely would be done, it would take a mighty big guarantee of benefit to justify this cloning experiment. I am willing to venture that the possible benefit will never, ever reach the point where this list of horrible likely downsides could be overcome. Even justifying trying to resurrect a woolly mammoth, or a mastodon, or the dodo bird or any other extinct animal gets ethically thorny. How many failures would be acceptable to get one viable mastodon? Where would the animal live? What would we feed it? Who would protect it from poachers, gawkers and treasure hunters? It is not so simple to take a long dead species, make enough of them so they don't die of isolation and lack of social stimulation and then find an environment that is close enough and safe enough compared with that which they once roamed. In any event the most interesting aspects of genetic engineering do not involve making humans or Neanderthals or mammoths. They involve ginning up microbes to do things that we really need doing such as making clean fuel, sucking up carbon dioxide, cleaning fat out of our arteries, giving us a lot more immunity to nasty bacteria and viruses and helping us make plastics and chemicals more efficiently and cheaply. In trying to make these kinds of microbes, you can kill all you want without fear of ethical condemnation. And if the new bug does not like the environment in which it has to exist to live well, that will be just too darn bad. The ethical challenge of this kind of synthetic biology is that it can be used by bad guys for bad purposes. Biological weapons can be ginned up and microbes created that only infect people with certain genes that commonly associate with racial or ethnic groups. Rather than worry about what will happen to real estate values should a new crop of ""Flintstones"" move in down the street, our public officials, religious groups and ethicists need to get serious about how much regulation the genetic engineering of microbes needs, how can we detect what terrorists might try to use, what sort of controls do we need to prevent accidents and who is going to pay if a bug turns out to cause more harm than good. We love to think that the key to tomorrow lies in what humanity can be designed or empowered to do. Thus, the fascination with human cloning. In reality, at least for a long time to come, the future belongs to what we can do to design and control microbes. That is admittedly duller, but it is far better to follow a story that is true than one such as Neanderthal cloning that is pure, speculative fantasy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Arthur Caplan.","Arthur Caplan: It would be unethical to try and clone a Neanderthal baby .

"New York (CNN) -- President Obama's decision to follow through on plans to reduce the American troop level in Iraq to 50,000 and shift away from combat missions is a sign that he believes America's energy and resources can better be used elsewhere, says analyst Fareed Zakaria. Obama said Tuesday the U.S. is on track with the troop withdrawal and mission change to take effect at the end of this month. The president is proceeding while Iraq's key political forces remain deadlocked over the makeup of the government. ""I think he views it as fundamentally a place where we have to reduce our profile, reduce our impact,"" Zakaria said, ""because ultimately this was an act of hubris that needs to be reined in."" In Zakaria's view, the efforts the U.S. has put into overturning the Saddam Hussein regime and stabilizing Iraq have not been worth the cost. ""In the long run, if Iraq does stabilize and becomes a workable, even a flawed democracy, then I do think that perhaps that judgment will change in the long view of history. But right now, if one were being honest, one would have to say it wasn't worth it."" The author and host of CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS"" spoke to CNN on Wednesday. Here is an edited transcript: . CNN: President Obama says that he's fulfilling a promise by drawing down forces from Iraq to 50,000 by the end of this month. What's the significance of that? Fareed Zakaria: I think the greater significance than the troop numbers is that he said that American forces next month will stop doing combat missions. That is really a crucial change -- it's the culmination of a process, it's not abrupt -- but it really means the US military is out of the business of war fighting, of street fighting, the business of tackling militias and basically exists as a training force to help the Iraqi military to stabilize the Iraqi government. That gets the American military more into the role it has played in places like South Korea and Okinawa, than in the intense war-fighting, counter insurgency mold it's been in in Iraq. I do think it's an important turning point. CNN: What's the state of the Iraqi regime now? Zakaria: Iraq remains very troubled. You cannot pretend otherwise. The simplest indication of this is 2 to 2.5 million people fled Iraq in the years after the invasion, mostly in 2004, 2005, 2006, and from all accounts there is just a trickle of people returning. Most of the people who left were middle class, most were Sunni -- the managerial administrative elite of the country. The fact that they haven't returned tells you that they still don't see much of a future for themselves in Iraq and until the Iraqi government is able to be genuinely pluralistic and genuinely open, genuinely a broad coalition, I think you will have the problems of instability. It's caused by, on the one hand, Sunni extremist organizations that see the government as Shiite tyranny and, on the other hand, Shiite militias that try to combat those Sunni extremists. That's where we remain -- it's all at a much lower level, but the fundamental problem hasn't gone away. The fundamental political problem has never been solved; there has never been a genuine national reconciliation with a government that is trying to open itself to all segments of Iraqi society. The dysfunction that you see, the paralysis, is just the symptom. The deeper problem is the political divide. CNN: In light of that conflict, why is Obama proceeding with the withdrawal? Zakaria: Obama believes this is a war we should never have gotten involved in, that it has been a waste of American resources -- most importantly American lives but also treasure -- and that his job is to minimize the exposure of the United States to this and reduce our commitments so that he can focus America's energy and efforts in other places. And he's been very disciplined about this, very unsentimental about it. When you say is it still unstable, I think the answer is yes, but I don't think Obama is waiting for this place to become like Italy or France, a developed democracy, before he reduces the commitment to a significantly smaller number. CNN: Which way could this go -- toward further healing or the possibility of renewed civil war? Zakaria: Renewed civil war seems highly unlikely. An adviser to General Petraeus once put it this way -- he said Iraq will stabilize once the Sunnis realize that they have lost, and the Shias realize they have won. And I think that fundamentally has happened. The Sunnis realize they can't overturn this government militarily. Of course there are some insurgent groups and some militia activity but basically it's sporadic and represents a small element of the population. The rest of them are dissatisfied, but they're not going to take up arms. And I think the Shias realize they have more to gain by staying in the system, which they dominate, than by trying to overturn it. So I don't see civil war, but I think Iraq is going to remain very unsatisfying to outside observers. It does not seem on trajectory to become a happy liberal democracy... I think the United States should have been playing a much stronger role in pushing the Iraqi government to accommodate all segments of society and create a genuine national coalition. Under the Bush administration, we focused all our attention on the military elements of the problem until very late when General Petraeus came in. Even then the civilian side has not pushed hard to create these compromises and coalitions. And under the Obama administration, there has been a very weak ambassador who has also had a kind of hands-off role. American influence is diminishing but it's still considerable, and it's surprising to me that we didn't use it to try to create a more stable governing coalition... CNN: Stepping back, at this point what is the likely verdict of history on the US involvement in Iraq? Zakaria: So far at this point it's very difficult to make the case that the benefits have overridden the costs. As I said, you have 2.5 million Iraqis who fled, thousands, maybe tens of thousands who were killed, thousands of Americans who were killed, enormous expenditure, and there's not much to show for it. It is absolutely true that Saddam Hussein's rule was an evil regime, significantly more evil than your run of the mill dictatorship, this was more like a totalitarian regime, but it's been replaced by a very dysfunctional polity. And to the average Iraqi, it's been a really, really difficult, unstable seven years, which has been plagued by violence, the collapse of their living standards, constant interruptions in their normal daily life from things like power outages. CNN: Are there lessons here for what the U.S. is doing in Afghanistan? Zakaria: I think the main lesson I would say is to be modest about what you can achieve and work hard on the political compromises, because those are the key. You can achieve a certain level of stability by using the military, but the underlying problem doesn't go away. And in the Afghan case, the issue is: Can you find a way to get the Pashtuns reconciled to the Karzai government without alienating the other ethnic groups in Afghanistan? We tend not to think in those terms in the United States. We tend to think of good guys and bad guys, but the truth is that the ethnic divisions are real and lasting, and they just have to be accommodated. There has to be a way to share power.","President Obama says withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq is on track .

"(CNN) -- A 4-year-old autistic boy who was missing after four bodies were discovered near his Florida home has been found safe, authorities said Friday. Police had ""grave concerns"" about Ismael Tristan Santisteban's safety, saying he was believed to be with 28-year-old Adam Matos, who they would later name a suspect in the quadruple homicide. ""Thank God Tristan is OK,"" Pasco County Sheriff Chris Nocco said. An investigative effort by an alphabet soup of Florida law enforcement agencies, plus tips from the public, helped lead police to Matos and Tristan at the Floridan Palace Hotel in Tampa, about 40 miles from the home in Hudson where the bodies were found. The relationship between Tristan and Matos remained unclear -- some told police they were father and son, and others described Matos as a ""father figure"" to the boy. Pasco County sheriff's deputies and Tampa police prepared their SWAT teams once the pair was found, but in the end used a less forceful approach to apprehend Matos. Police lured Matos out of his hotel room with a ""ruse,"" Tampa police Chief Jane Castor said. He didn't put up a fight, Nocco said. Castor said that investigators who have talked with Tristan report that the boy is unharmed and is cooperating with police. Matos was arrested on aggravated assault charges stemming from an August 28 incident when he allegedly put a knife up to Tristan's mother. Matos is the suspect in the killings of the four adults -- two men and two women -- who were found on hill about three-quarters of a mile from the house in Hudson, Nocco said. The names of the victims have not been released, pending confirmation of their identities via DNA tests, he said. Matos was briefly employed as a dishwasher at a seafood restaurant down the street from the home, CNN affiliate Bay News 9 reported. He worked there for about seven to 10 days but stopped coming in last week, according to managers at the restaurant. ""One day, he said he had to watch his son and then we never saw him,"" said John Hill, the owner. Managers said Matos last came to the restaurant on August 29 to pick up his last paycheck.

"Gaziantep, Turkey (CNN) -- For the past eight months, close to 300 U.S. soldiers have stood guard on a hillside overlooking one of Turkey's largest cities, scanning the skies for the threat of missiles fired from nearby Syria. The American men and women, wearing full battle armor and helmets under the hot September sun, operate a series of Patriot missile launchers and radar stations, designed to hunt and shoot down incoming missiles. Middle East reconfigured: Turkey vs. Iran vs. Saudi Arabia . It is a U.S. military ""boots on the ground"" deployment close to the Syrian border that has been largely overlooked during the furious debate in Washington over whether to attack the Syrian regime. ""We're protecting against any tactical ballistic missile or rocket attack that may come from the country of Syria,"" said Lt. Col. John Dawber, commander of the Patriot missile battalion originating from Fort Sill, Oklahoma. ""Our presence here is to deter such an attack, and if that attack does come, to defeat any attack on our asset."" The ""asset"" is Gaziantep, a fast-growing industrial city of 1.4 million inhabitants. This sprawling metropolis is about 30 miles from the Syrian border and barely a two-hour drive from the northern Syrian battlefield city of Aleppo, which has been the target of months of Syrian government airstrikes and Scud surface-to-surface missile attacks. Late last year, at the request of the Turkish government, the U.S., Germany and the Netherlands agreed to send three Patriot missile battalions to their NATO ally, to protect the Turkish cities of Gaziantep, Adana and Kahramanmaras. The decision was reached after a series of deadly cross-border incidents, during which the Turkish government accused Syrian government forces of killing Turkish citizens with artillery and small arms fire. The possibility that chemical weapons were used on a massive scale in neighborhoods around Damascus last week has only escalated the potential threat along the border, especially after the Syrian government threatened retaliation against U.S. allies Turkey, Jordan and Israel if it was targeted by an American attack. The U.S. troops stationed in Gaziantep say surface-to-surface missiles equipped with chemical warheads are weapons the Patriot missile systems are designed to combat. ""The nature of our branch (of the military), air defense artillery, is that there is always a chemical threat,"" said Capt. Tarik Jones, a native of Woodbridge, Virginia. Lt. Col. Dawber added that the Patriot missiles' ability to destroy missiles armed with chemical weapons depended on many factors, including the quantity of poison on the warhead, the type of chemical agent and weather conditions. But, he added, ""I'm pretty sure we can mitigate most of that, if not all of that, based on certain conditions."" For laymen, Jones summed up the complicated advanced technology and physics behind the Patriot system with a Nintendo video game analogy. He called the Patriots ""Duck Hunt."" ""We are able to engage missiles that are coming into the city, by shooting missiles out that are able to intercept it in the middle of the air,"" he said. There are ample reasons why the Syrian government would want to attack Gaziantep. Tens -- if not hundreds -- of thousands of Syrian refugees and exiles are believed to have settled here over the past two years. It is a key operations hub for international aid efforts to northern Syria. But Gaziantep is also an important rear base of operations for Syrian opposition groups, who are supported and, in some cases, armed by the Turkish government. The mission of the U.S. troops deployed here is unusual because from their vantage point, they can see the city they have been assigned to protect. ""This is the first time in my 18-year career that we can see the asset that we're defending,"" said Dawber, who gazed past rows of Patriot missile launchers at the cityscape below. ""It's a special reward to also enjoy the view, while protecting the asset that we cover.""","Close to 300 U.S. soldiers protect Gaziantep, an industrial city of 1.4 million people .

"(CNN) -- The Obama administration is stepping up security for some flights headed to the United States from Europe and the Middle East, reflecting heightened concern that terrorists are developing more sophisticated bombs designed to avoid airport screening. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said in a statement that he has directed the Transportation Security Administration to ""implement enhanced security measures in the coming days"" at selected overseas airports. ""We will work to ensure these necessary steps pose as few disruptions to travelers as possible,"" Johnson said in a statement. ""We are sharing recent and relevant information with our foreign allies and are consulting the aviation industry."" Specific steps or airports were not disclosed. A homeland security official said that TSA would work with airlines and security agencies overseas and that the changes will primarily focus on airports in Europe and the Middle East. The effort does not involve changes to what travelers can take aboard flights. But passengers may see additional inspections of shoes and electronics, additional use of scanners designed to detect trace amounts of explosives, and another stage of screening at boarding gates, in some cases, the official said. The measures do not involve U.S. domestic flights, and passengers could see changes as early as next week. The changes came about based on new intelligence on terror groups trying to build new types of improvised explosives that are harder to detect, the official told CNN. There was no specific plot. The UK Department for Transport confirmed Wednesday that it is stepping up some of its aviation security measures. ""For obvious reasons we will not be commenting in detail on those changes. The majority of passengers should not experience significant disruption,"" a spokesman said. ""The UK has some of the most robust aviation security measures and we will continue to take all the steps necessary to ensure that public safety is maintained."" Since hardening cockpit doors and taking other measures after the 9/11 al Qaeda attacks, the U.S. aviation security focus has shifted primarily from hijackings to plastic and other explosives that can be carried aboard a plane or hidden in baggage. The United States has particularly been focused on efforts by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula to develop undetectable explosives since the unsuccessful attempt by the so-called ""underwear bomber"" to bring down a Delta Air Lines jet over Detroit in 2009.

"London (CNN) -- The Democratic Republic of Congo has been torn apart for most of its bloody history. Its people have known little other than death, war and greed. The central African state has been plagued by fighting over the control of its phenomenal natural resources -- a wealth of diamonds, gold and copper that sparked a war responsible for the deaths of over five million people. But now its citizens have the chance to experience rare unity as the country's top football team seeks to complete an incredible journey. African champions TP Mazembe will take on the might of Europe's finest, Inter Milan, in the final of the FIFA Club World Cup in Abu Dhabi on Saturday night. Mazembe shock Internacional to reach final . The club hails from Lubumbashi in the south-eastern region of Katanga, which has a history of separatism and experienced some of the worst fighting in the complicated, five-year war between 1998 and 2003. The conflict pitted different Congolese ethnic groups -- funded and armed by many of the country's neighbors -- against each other. As many as 20,000 United Nations troops remain to keep the peace -- the world's biggest peace keeping mission -- but unrest, including murders and mass rapes, continue in the north and east of the country. Just last August, the U.N. was criticized by human rights groups when at least 240 women, children and babies were raped within a few miles of their base in Luvungi. Yet Katanga has enjoyed relative peace in recent years, in large part thanks to the province's popular governor Moise Katumbi, a billionaire Roman Abramovich-esque character who has regulated the region's previously chaotic natural mineral extraction and bankrolled TP Mazembe in the process. Inter Milan ease into World Club final . ""Soccer is something very good for the kids to do ... to stay out of doing bad things,"" Katumbi told CNN. ""They can help the country, the national team, and help also their families, because today you can see the money that is going into soccer is crazy."" Katumbi's money has transformed TP Mazembe from a failing club with an illustrious past -- they won back to back African titles in 1968 and 1969 -- into the best team on the continent. Rather than spending big on flashy foreign imports, he has instead invested in Congolese players, paying European-level wages to keep them at the club and out of the hands of European scouts used to picking off Africa's best talent for a pittance. The players' salaries are rumored to be as high as $3,000 a week in a country where the average yearly wage is, according to Christian aid group World Vision, just $120. Africans win opening match in Abu Dhabi . ""[TP Mazembe] give 80% of our players to the national team of Congo,"" Katumbi explained. ""We have over 2,000 boys at our academy, training to be the next Messi, to be the next Ronaldinho. I like doing social programs for the people, that's why I'm in soccer. Soccer is social. I don't like anyone to suffer."" In African terms, the money dwarfs every other team on the continent. ""Just to give you an idea of how uneven the playing field is, I met Katumbi in Harare when I watched TP Mazembe play the Zimbabwean champions,"" said Steve Bloomfield, foreign editor of Monocle magazine and author of the book Africa United: How Football Explains Africa. ""Their entire budget for the year was $200,000. But I asked Katumbi, and he said: ""If we win, the players and staff share $250,000."" TP Mazembe's bonus pool for one match was bigger than the budget for the Zimbabwean champions for a whole season. ""Money is no problem and this helps attract great players but, crucially, it helps them keep the players from European clubs because he can pay good wages,"" Bloomfield said. From fishing boats to the Club World Cup . The huge budget helped TP Mazembe win the African Champions League title in 2009 for the first time in more than 40 years, and with it qualification for the FIFA Club World Cup, a competition that pits the champions from the ruling body's six confederations against each other. For the players, it was a hugely significant moment, one that they felt could have a transformative effect on their war-torn country. ""There was many times my life was at risk ... but with the end of the war I am happy that there is now peace,"" TP Mazembe's captain Tresor Mputu told CNN last year before his debut in the competition. ""Football is a huge factor for development in Africa, in DR Congo especially. People love football so much, it unifies even in times of war."" But TP Mazembe's second appearance at the Club World Cup was almost over before it started. TP Mazembe crowned kings of Africa . At a goodwill tournament in Rwanda earlier this year, Mputu -- considered to be the best footballer still playing on the continent -- was banned by FIFA for a year after karate-kicking a referee. The match, and the tournament, was subsequently cancelled and the team expelled from the country. Missing their star player, Mazembe struggled in the early rounds of the African Champions League, but battled through before hammering Tunisian side Esperance 5-0 in the final. Yet without Mputu, the team has made it to the Club World Cup final, beating Mexico's Pachuca and Brazil's Internacional along the way, without conceding a goal. Mazembe's success has seen Katumbi's popularity soar across Congo, so much so that the businessman is seen by many as a Presidential candidate once U.N. forces leave and elections are held at the end of 2011. Mazembe win 2009 African Champions League . ""He is a politician and [funding TP Mazembe] helps his political profile,"" Bloomfield said. ""Not just in Katanga, where 90% voted for him. He wants to send a message to the rest of Congo and wants to be seen as the rich philanthropic leader who builds roads and hospitals. ""He used to be very good friends with [President Joseph] Kabila, but have had a bit of a falling-out. I don't think he will stand against him, but he will stand [in the future]. Congolese politics is very murky but I'll be very surprised if he didn't run for the presidency."" For now, though, the club is concentrating on how to beat UEFA Champions League winners Inter Milan in Saturday's final in Abu Dhabi. For once, the entire country will be united behind one flag. ""In TP Mazembe you find players who come from all the different provinces,"" Katumbi said. ""They have become something that belongs to the country.""","Congolese club TP Mazembe becomes first African team to reach FIFA Club World Cup final .

"(CNN) -- Geoffrey Holder, a versatile artist known for his ability as a dancer, actor and -- most famously to most of America -- a pitchman for 7Up, has died. He was 84. The cause was complications due to pneumonia, according to Charles M. Mirotznik, his family's attorney. Holder, who stood an imposing 6-foot-6 and had a deep, mellifluous, Caribbean-lilted voice, was a multitalented performer who easily shifted between painting, theater, film and TV. He won two Tony awards in 1975 for the musical ""The Wiz,"" the vibrant all-black re-telling of ""The Wizard of Oz."" Holder earned awards for best direction and a Tony for best costume design. With his regal stature made him an unforgettable presence on screen, as well. Some of his more memorable work appears in 1967's ""Doctor Dolittle,"" 1982's ""Annie"" and 1973's ""Live and Let Die,"" in which he faced off against Roger Moore's James Bond as the villain Baron Samedi. In later decades he worked with Eddie Murphy in 1992's ""Boomerang,"" and more recently did voice work in 2005's ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."" Holder could even make a commercial sing. For TV viewers in the '70s and '80s, the performer was most familiar as the dapper pitchman in 7Up ads, telling viewers to sample the ""Un-Cola"" in his rich voice. For someone who was renowned in so many arenas, Holder's advertising work may have come as a surprise. But as he explained to People magazine in 1975, ""I'm no snob. The commercial is an art form unto itself. After all, you are seducing people."" Holder honed his artistic gifts from an early age. Born in Port of Spain, Trinidad, in 1930, he joined his older brother's dance troupe at the age of 7. By 1954, Holder was making his Broadway debut in the musical ""House of Flowers."" He followed that up with principal dancer work with New York's Metropolitan Opera Ballet in 1955 and 1956, and went on to star in an all-black production of ""Waiting for Godot"" in 1957. That same year, he was awarded a Guggenheim fellowship for painting. On top of that, Holder was also an author: He released a cookbook of Caribbean cuisine in 1973. Holder is survived by his wife, Carmen De Lavallade, whom he married in 1955, and their son, LÃ©o. People we've lost in 2014 .

"(CNN) -- Police have identified human remains found buried under recently added concrete at a home in Plant City, Florida, as missing lottery millionaire Abraham Shakespeare, police said Friday. Dr. Dollete White of the Hillsborough County Medical Examiner's Office made the identification. CNN affiliate WTSP reported that the remains were identified from fingerprints. The full results of an autopsy should be ready Monday, the medical examiner's office said, noting that it will work through the weekend to try to discover the cause of death. The Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office called in an anthropologist from the University of South Florida to assist during the dig. Debbie Carter with the sheriff's office said, ""it took so long because investigators only removed 4 inches of dirt at a time so to not disturb any possible evidence."" Deputies made the discovery of remains Thursday after a tip came in, suggesting that investigators would find a body near a home in Plant City, according to CNN affiliate WFTV. However, Hillsborough County Sheriff David Gee said the investigation and information specifically led authorities to the area after they began to believe that he might be dead because of ""sinister means and motives."" ""Our indications were it would be there,"" Gee said Thursday night. Police scanned the newly finished concrete slabs near the home on Wednesday and removed them. On Thursday, Gee said that they discovered the remains buried 5 feet below the surface and that it appeared they had been there for a while. Shakespeare, a 43-year-old truck driver, won a $31 million Florida lottery prize in 2006. A year later, he won a court challenge from a fellow trucker who accused Shakespeare of snatching the winning ticket out of his wallet while the two were delivering meat to Miami restaurants. Shakespeare's family reported him missing November 9, telling the Polk County sheriff's office that they hadn't seen him since April. Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said that when his investigation began, authorities had hoped to find Shakespeare alive ""and he truly had just wanted to hide from those who were asking him for money."" ""As our investigation continued, the information we developed led us to believe he may very well have ended up with an untimely death,"" Judd said. Both Judd and Gee would not comment on whether anything else was found inside the man-made grave or whether a previous person of interest was connected to the area. The home, according to WFTV, belongs to the boyfriend of a person of interest in the disappearance of Shakespeare. Police said they were now shifting their focus to a murder investigation. ""It's painfully obvious he didn't get there by himself,"" Judd said. Gee said police from Polk and Hillsborough counties were already working with prosecutors on the case and hope to bring to justice the person responsible for what they say is clearly cold-blooded murder. ""Somebody put that body in that hole,"" Gee said. ""This isn't by any means just where we find someone on the side of the road. Somebody has obviously put him there.""

"(CNN) -- A giant cross that has stood on a Southern California mountain for decades must be removed because it violates the constitutional separation of church and state, a judge ordered this week. The order Thursday by U.S. District Judge Larry Burns continues a long legal battle about the 43-foot cross atop Mt. Soledad in San Diego. Burns ordered that the cross would have to be removed within 90 days. But the cross may be able to stay if the case is appealed, the judge ordered. ""Of course we are disappointed in what the ruling is -- that is to take the cross down,"" Bruce Bailey, president of the Mount Soledad Memorial Association told CNN affiliate KGTV. Bailey said his organization plans to appeal, which would mean the cross would stay as the decades-long legal battle continued. Long legal battle . The cross was erected in 1954 in honor of Korean War veterans and has been the subject of near constant judicial back and forth since 1989, when two Vietnam War veterans filed suit saying it violated the California Constitution's ""No Preference"" clause. Since the first lawsuit in 1989, the city of San Diego twice tried selling the property beneath the cross to the Mount Soledad Memorial Association, only to be stopped by the courts. In 2004, the parties involved reached an agreement that would have moved the cross to a nearby church, but two congressmen intervened and inserted a rider into the 2005 omnibus budget bill that designated the property a national veterans memorial and authorized the federal government to accept the donation of the property. This led to more fights and more court filings. In 2006, three congressmen pushed through a bill calling for the government to seize the property by eminent domain -- calling it ""a historically significant war memorial."" The federal government took possession in August of that year. A lawsuit was filed challenging that transfer almost immediately and that has led to Thursday's ruling.","The judge orders the giant cross must be removed in 90 days .

"(CNN) -- The nation's aviation security chief on Thursday defended his recent decision to again permit knives aboard commercial flights, despite concerns from major airlines and their flight crews, and sharp criticism from some members of Congress. John Pistole, administrator of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), told a House Homeland Security subcommittee that his decision would stand and would be carried out next month as planned. He said small knives no longer pose a threat to aircraft security, which now emphasizes bomb detection. ""A small pocket knife is simply not going to result in the catastrophic failure of an aircraft and an improvised explosive device will,"" he said. ""And we know, from internal covert testing, searching for these items, which will not blow up an aircraft, can distract our officers from focusing on the components of an improvised explosive device."" Small knives were banned along with a host of other undersized sharp objects like nail clippers, screwdrivers and cosmetic scissors, following the 9/11 al Qaeda hijack attacks on the United States. Talk Back: Should the TSA walk back the knife policy? There has been a gradual easing of those prohibitions in recent years as planes hardened onboard security and the potential threats shifted away from hijackings and more toward attempts by terrorists to bring down planes with bombs. Still, Pistole's decision has roiled the industry. The major carriers have as a group raised concerns about the move with three - Delta, American, and US Airways coming out in opposition. Pistole's supporters believe the rules should be more passenger-friendly and focus on bombs and other threats that can be hard to detect and be smuggled aboard the passenger cabin or in cargo. But critics contend that even small pocket and other knives still pose too great a safety and security risk for airline crews, reminding that the 9/11 hijackers used box cutters to take control of four jetliners. Pistole stood firm as he faced questions and criticism from lawmakers. ""I think the decision is solid and it stands,"" Pistole said. ""I plan to move forward with it."" Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-California, criticized the logic behind the move, arguing that threats posed by bombs do not mean knives aren't dangerous. ""Just because this is a new threat does not mean that old threats don't still exist,"" he said. Swalwell co-authored a letter to Pistole saying he was ""mystified"" by his decision, calling it ""another example of a questionable TSA policy."" Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, said Pistole needed to change course on the rule change -- fast. ""You need to stop this now,"" she said. ""These cause bleeding. These cause injury. These can cause a terrible tragedy. And I don't want to take it to the next length. It can possibly cause someone to lose their life."" Other lawmakers said they supported Pistole and praised his efforts in leading the agency. ""Why should the federal government devote taxpayer dollars to low-risk people, places, or things?"" said Rep. Richard Hudson, R-North Carolina, the subcommittee's chairman. In the nine days since the TSA opened a can of worms by announcing it would ease the ban on small knives in airline cabins, the list of groups concerned or opposed to the idea has grown to include airlines, airport screeners, federal air marshals, flight attendants and pilots. So far, the TSA has persisted. The surge in recent criticism from so many groups drew the attention of Rep. Cedric Richmond, D-Louisiana. ""I don't question your judgment, because you do what you do, and we have to trust that you're making the right decisions,"" Richmond said. But he said he questioned the process Pistole had used, arguing that he hadn't involved enough stakeholders from the airline industry. ""I'm not asking you to defer to them, but a lot of the time it helps if they're at the table when you're making a decision so that they have the information that you have,"" he said. Pistole said he met with flight attendants on Wednesday, but conceded that he could have done a better job of bringing them into the process earlier. Under the new rules, which go into effect April 25, knives with blades that are 2.36 inches (6 centimeters) or shorter and less than a half-inch wide will be allowed in airline cabins so long as the blade is not fixed or does not lock into place. The rules also allow passengers to carry up to two golf clubs, certain toy bats or other sports sticks -- such as ski poles, hockey sticks, lacrosse sticks and pool cues -- aboard in carry-on luggage. The TSA has said it's aligning its policy with international rules. But after consulting with Federal Air Marshal Service leaders, the agency opted to continue excluding knives that most closely resemble weapons, specifically knives with blades that lock in place, or have molded hand grips. Box cutters and razor blades also would remain on the prohibited items list. Related: Knives on planes: Who's for it, who's against . Airlines for America, the trade association representing the major U.S. airlines, said Monday that ""additional discussion is warranted"" before small knives are allowed on planes. Three of the nation's five biggest carriers, Delta, American and US Airways, have spoken out against the policy. Related: Need a tribal spear? Try TSA . Many critics of the new rules contend that in addition to adding an unnecessary threat to the safety of airline crews and passengers, the changes won't make a difference in the TSA's ability to concentrate on other threats. Knives are probably the most common items surrendered by passengers at screening points, aside from liquids. Travelers surrender about 35 knives at Baltimore-Washington International Airport on an average day and about 47 per day at Los Angeles International Airport, officials say. ""Today, we find on average of four guns at checkpoints, but we also find about 2,000 of these small pocket knives every day,"" Pistole said on Thursday. ""On average that takes two to three minutes for the pocket knife to be identified, for that bag to be pulled, for that bag to be opened, for the knife to be found,"" he added. That's valuable time, he said, noting that other more dangerous items could slip by security screeners. Questioned by reporters, White House spokesman Jay Carney said he did not think President Barack Obama had a response to the issue. ""I'm sure that the TSA has been asked this question and explained their thinking in making decisions like this; DHS as well, I assume,"" Carney said of the TSA's parent agency, the Homeland Security Department. ""My understanding as a layman, as an observer, not as somebody who has worked the policy process, is that this has to do with an assessment of where the most likely threats are,"" Carney said.","TSA administrator: ""I think the decision is solid and it stands""

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- With a long red AIDS ribbon pinned to his chest, Chinese Vice Premier Li Keqiang warned of the grave situation of HIV/AIDS in China, calling it ""not only a medical issue but also a social challenge."" On the week of World AIDS Day, the man expected to replace Wen Jiabao as premier next year, publicly acknowledged the nation's challenges with the epidemic. The disease shows no sign of abating in the world's most populous country. AIDS related-deaths have increased by 8.6 percent to 17,740 deaths, compared with the previous year, according to the country's health figures. And 68,802 new HIV/AIDS cases were reported this year up to October, according to Chinese state media. But some HIV/AIDS advocates say the number of cases is underestimated, in part because many people who have HIV/AIDS may never have been tested to know their status. CDC: Half of young people with HIV don't know it . China has grappled with a checkered HIV history that includes a contaminated blood scandal in a central province and, in years past, denying that AIDS was a problem in the country. But recently, China's elite has appeared to champion HIV/AIDS causes. Peng Liyuan, the wife of China's presumptive next president, Xi Jinping is the World Health Organization's Goodwill Ambassador for Tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. Li, who also heads a commission on the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, met with health activists on Monday and vowed action. ""Li is very friendly and decisive,"" said Li Hu, director of HaiHeZhiXing AIDS Volunteer Group, who met with the leader. ""There are hopes that we can do a better job with leader's help."" In statements published in state-run news media, the vice premier pledged greater support and tax breaks for HIV/AIDS organizations, an expansion of free drug treatment for people with the disease and protection of patients from discrimination at hospitals. But Li's words were of little comfort for a migrant worker who said his family's life was ruined by AIDS. He traveled to Beijing seeking legal redress and spoke to CNN, requesting anonymity due to the sensitive nature of HIV/AIDS issues. Opinion: Creating an AIDS-free generation by starting at home . ""I don't feel anything,"" said the man, about Li's declaration. He came to the capital from Henan province, where Li had served as governor. His wife gave blood in a blood drive sponsored by local officials in the province in 1997. As a student, she had been urged to give blood because it was ""an honor,"" the man said. The couple learned last year during a prenatal screening that she has AIDS and will soon learn if their one-year-old child is HIV-positive. He says the family faces financial hardships, and his wife is unable to work because of health problems. While his wife and child receive free AIDS medication from the government, he estimates spending $6,500 to treat related infections caused by her weakened immune system that are not covered by the program. Their one-year-old baby cannot drink breast milk, due to concerns about HIV infection, he said. Though there's no way to prove that his wife contracted the disease in the blood drives in Henan in the 1990s, he remains convinced and is planning to make his case in Beijing like many others from the province have. In 1998, Li became the governor of Henan, one of the most populous provinces in China, which was also one of the areas most devastated by HIV/AIDS. During his stint, there were criticisms related to an HIV/AIDS outbreak linked to local blood banks. State-run media attributed the disease's spread to ""illegal blood sales and contaminated blood transfusions.""  The central government began tightening controls over the business in the mid-1990s once more was known about HIV and how the virus is spread. While most of the infections happened before Li arrived in Henan, he faced major criticism. Read more: Hillary Clinton unveils 'blueprint' to combat AIDS . ""We have been criticizing him over the blood scandal in Henan, which many people died in silence without getting medical help,"" said Wan Yanhai, a former government health official turned AIDS advocate. Wan was arrested in 2002 in Beijing after publishing a government report on the spread of AIDS in Henan. ""I do believe [Li] has done some good things, if we look at the record of him as a governor and party head,"" Wan said. But he added there was silence during Li's years in Henan. During Li's tenure there, journalists trying to write about HIV/AIDS were detained, activists and doctors were sent away, Wan said. He left China in 2010, citing harassment by authorities. Li's recent outreach to the HIV/AIDS community was welcomed by Li Hu, an activist based in Tianjin, who called it ""definitely a boost for our work. Policies can only be well executed with their supervision."" In recent years, China has made a series of progressive reforms. It lifted a ban prohibiting foreigners with HIV from visiting the country in 2010 -- the same year as the United States. China also promised antiretroviral treatment for all patients with HIV in 2003. A UNAIDS report released last week lauded China for increasing the number of people receiving antiretroviral treatment by 50% last year. Almost a decade ago, the Chinese government formed a policy called ""Four frees, one care"" that would give free blood tests for those with HIV, free education for AIDS orphans, free consultation and screening tests, and free antiretroviral therapy for pregnant women. But hundreds protested in Henan in August, calling for full implementation of the government's HIV/AIDS policies across the province.","Vice premier Li Keqiang pledges support for battling HIV/AIDS in China .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- The head of the company that operated a passenger ferry that sank off South Korea last month killing more than 260 people was arrested Thursday, a senior prosecutor in the investigation told CNN. Kim Han-sik, chief executive officer of Cheonghaejin Marine Company, is being charged with ""causing death by negligence, as well as causing the capsizing of the ship in the line of duty,"" prosecutor Yang Joong-jin said. Kim also faces a charge of violating the ship safety act, Yang said, in connection with allegations that excessive cargo a played a role in the April 16 sinking. Investigators have said the cargo and the failure to tie it down properly was partially responsible for the sinking of the ferry Sewol, which was carrying 467 passengers and crew -- including more than 300 high school students on a field trip. Investigators said they've indicted four employees of the ferry's owner in the last two weeks, including a senior executive Tuesday. Details about the charges weren't immediately available. Authorities took aim at the cargo Tuesday, saying its weight was more than double the ship's limit. The cargo wasn't tied properly -- and the loosely tied goods helped cause the ship to capsize, Yang has said. Investigators had been probing the possibility the ship overturned because cargo shifted and forced the ship off balance. At least 269 people died in the disaster, which happened while the ferry was traveling from Incheon to the resort island of Jeju, off South Korea's southwestern coast. Thirty-five people still are unaccounted for, according to the country's coast guard. News of Kim's arrest comes nearly a week after South Korean authorities searched Cheonghaejin Marine's offices as part of a criminal investigation. This trip wasn't the first time the ferry had excess cargo, a joint investigation team told reporters Tuesday. Since the Sewol began the Incheon-Jeju route in March 2013, the ferry carried excess cargo 139 times, investigators said. Cheonghaejin Marine earned an extra 62 million South Korean won ($62,000) for the excess cargo on the April 16 voyage, and nearly 3 billion South Korean won ($2.9 million) in extra profit for all of the excess cargo that the ferry carried since March 2013, investigators said.","Kim Han-sik is chief executive officer of Cheonghaejin Marine Company .

"(CNN) -- It's been called the fourth ""R"" of education: reading, writing, arithmetic and now, aerobics. But the gym class of generation Wii isn't the same one you probably remember from school. ""You hear sometimes the old stories ... where you roll the ball out and students just played the game,"" says Hanna Vaandering, president of the Oregon Education Association. ""That's not what physical education is about today."" As they struggle to keep kids active in the midst of an obesity epidemic, PE teachers are using technology and the latest fitness trends to inspire even the most nonathletic children to develop a lifelong love for exercise. ""If you don't have health, what do you have?"" Vaandering asks. ""You've got to make sure (students) understand how to take care of their body."" Fighting an epidemic . Stop me if you've heard these statistics before: Approximately 17% of Americans age 2 to 19 years old are obese. Though recent studies have shown signs of progress, an estimated one out of every eight preschoolers in the United States is still obese, according to the CDC. And only 25% of adolescents between the ages of 12 and 15 met the national fitness recommendation of 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity daily in 2012. PE teachers have struggled to fight the effects of childhood obesity in class, says Vaandering; many children's motor skills are not where they should be and cardiovascular endurance is a big problem. And frankly, in general, ""kids are lazier,"" says Rich Muller, a PE teacher at Dwight-Englewood School in Englewood, New Jersey. ""They don't want to work. They don't want to do anything."" Not just flag football anymore . In his 28 years as an educator, Muller has seen a significant shift in the kinds of activities taught in gym classes. Just a decade ago, he says, the focus was 95% on team sports. Now teachers are incorporating golf, rock climbing, bowling and even ping-pong into their curriculum. ""I'm trying to find that environment where they can find that one lifelong activity,"" says Matthew Pomeroy, a PE teacher at Merton Intermediate School in Merton, Wisconsin. ""All those different things that kids can kind of be engaged in and enjoy."" Is yoga too religious for schools? While kids in Pomeroy's district tend to be more active than the average American middle schooler, he sees another troubling trend: students who are spending 10 to 12 months of the year playing only one sport. While that's great for physical fitness, he says, orthopedic surgeons are seeing an increase in children's sports injuries related to such repetitive motions. Both Muller and Pomeroy offer students at their respective schools a choice every day: They can play volleyball or do yoga; they can practice archery or work out in the weight room. Zumba. CrossFit. Geocaching. Tabata. Spinning. All these and more are offered to encourage students to move. ""The participation level has skyrocketed because they have more options,"" Muller says. ""It's fun. We have hardly any complaints like we used to."" Technology . If there's one thing Pomeroy is pumped about, it's using technology in his class. The self-proclaimed Twitter fanatic has reached out to PE teachers all over the world to bring new ideas to his students. Pomeroy's class uses iPads to analyze their archery or free throw techniques. With an app called Coach's Eye, they record videos of their shot, then play it back while discussing their form. Pomeroy has also split his class into groups to create their very own workout videos -- recording these at home is easier for some students than performing live in front of their peers, he says. Many schools provide pedometers and heart rate monitors for students, Vaandering says. When she taught elementary PE, she encouraged her students to increase the number of steps they took during every class. ""You'd see their little feet moving while we're giving instructions because they want to get more steps,"" she says with a laugh. Pomeroy has taken technology even further, using it to connect his students with others across the globe. In one instance he teamed up with a PE teacher in the United Kingdom to pull off an international dance team competition via Skype. Another time, his students gave jump rope lessons to their peers abroad. ""Sometimes for phys ed, you just need to get out of the gym,"" Pomeroy says. Stress . Perhaps one of the biggest differences Vaandering sees in students today is high levels of stress. An overemphasis on standardized tests and budget cuts has removed important stress outlets such as art class and PE in some schools, she says. A few districts in Oregon have even cut recess for elementary school. ""That's so not in line with brain research and what science tells us about a child's learning (process),"" Vaandering says. ""In reality there needs to be a balance and a respect for the whole child."" Why kids need recess . Some schools are getting the message that stress reduction is an important part of a child's overall well-being. They're incorporating yoga and meditation, Muller says, while educating the mind, body and spirit. In health class at Dwight-Englewood, students are offered the opportunity to use apps like Calm.com, which provides a soothing screen and sounds in timed blocks to calm the mind. ""It's amazing how much better you feel after two minutes,"" Muller says. What you can do . Parents play a big role in their children's success at school, Vaandering says, whether it's in math class or gym class. ""It really is important to do family activities,"" she says. ""Enjoying each other's company, going hiking, playing pickleball on the weekend."" Pomeroy agrees. ""You can make such a great connection with your kids through physical activity.""

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- Did President Obama break his promise to Latino voters that he'd deliver a comprehensive immigration reform plan in his first year? And if so, will it wind up costing Democratic candidates in the November mid-term elections and, for that matter, the president himself when he comes up for re-election in 2012? The answers are: yes and probably. Yes, of course, Obama broke his promise to Latinos. And it is probably true that, for doing so, Obama and fellow Democrats will continue to lose Latino support. And I'm not the only one saying it. This week, during an appearance on ""John King USA,"" Univision anchor Jorge Ramos blamed Obama and congressional Republicans for failing to take action to fix the nation's broken immigration system. The issue is at the center of Ramos' new book, ""A Country for All: An Immigrant Manifesto."" Guest host Jessica Yellin showed a video clip of Ramos asking candidate Obama in 2008 if he would commit to reforming the immigration system. Obama responded, ""I cannot guarantee that it's going to be in the first 100 days. But what I can guarantee is that we will have in the first year an immigration bill that I strongly support and that I'm promoting and that I want to move that forward as quickly as possible."" That first year came and went, and now we're 18 months into the Obama administration. There's no immigration bill in sight. In fact, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York, has said that he won't propose a bill he's been working on until after the November elections, possibly as late as March 2011. Yellin asked Ramos what he made of this. ""(Obama) broke his promise,"" he said. ""It's that simple, and obviously, he doesn't have the 60 votes."" Then, Ramos backed off a bit and, parroting a popular line coming out of the White House, started blaming the GOP. ""Where are the Republicans?"" he asked. ""Where are the 11 Republicans that voted for immigration reform two years ago? Where is John McCain?"" Indeed. McCain is running for re-election back in Arizona, doing his best impersonation of Wyatt Earp at Tombstone. The Straight Talk Express has become the Pander Mobile. Sure, the Republicans deserve their share of the blame, especially since they've tried to oversimplify and demagogue the issue to scare up support. But let's not forget which political party controls both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. The many Latinos I've been hearing from in the past six months haven't forgotten. Although he hails from Chicago, Illinois, a city and state with sizable Latino populations, Obama has spent most of his life in a black and white world. He knew very little about Latinos before he launched his presidential campaign, and he was forced to try to find a way to speak to them. He seized on the strategy of being a kinder and gentler alternative to Republicans on the immigration debate. He condemned ICE agents who ""terrorize"" immigrants by snatching parents away from their babies in workplace raids and promising to deliver comprehensive immigration reform in his first year in office. Now, after a year and a half in office, ICE is still conducting immigration raids, and comprehensive immigration reform isn't on the table. More and more of the Latinos I hear from feel as if they've been snookered. They see the passion that Obama put into an issue he really cared about -- health care  -- and they resent the fact that when it comes to immigration reform, the president seems to think that words speak louder than actions. What they resent even more is that they feel teased every time Obama makes yet another major speech promising to deliver something he has no intention of delivering -- comprehensive immigration reform. With the delaying and the teasing, it's not surprising that Obama's stock with Latino voters is falling. Obama won two-thirds of the Latino vote in 2008. In January, at the end of his first year, his job approval rating with Latinos stood at 69 percent. In February, it fell to 64 percent. And, in May, according to a recent Gallup poll, it slipped to 57 percent. Some political observers believe that the recently filed lawsuit by the Department of Justice against the Arizona immigration law is part of the administration's strategy of rebuilding support with Latinos, about 70 percent of whom oppose the measure. I hope not. For one thing, that strategy wouldn't work. Latinos aren't about to give Obama, a former lecturer on constitutional law, much credit for recognizing the obvious: that the Arizona law is blatantly unconstitutional because it usurps federal authority over immigration law in violation of Article 1, Section 8. The suit could have gone further and argued, as other lawsuits against the measure have, that the process of implementing the law runs the risk of violating the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment by singling out Latinos as the most likely to resemble illegal immigrants. Such a law is so odious that the idea that the federal government would challenge it is a given. After all, the Obama administration isn't suing Arizona to defend Latinos but to defend the Constitution. So that won't assuage the concerns of Latinos that the White House doesn't really care about them or issues that matter to them. The way to do that is to pass comprehensive immigration reform. Until that happens, words without actions are meaningless. In fact, every time this administration tries to reassure Latino voters that it is in their corner, the effect is the opposite. It reminds Latinos that, as long as Obama is in the White House, they're on their own. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette Jr.","Barack Obama promised to have an immigration bill he could support in his first year in office .

""It's a universal fashion affront tied into social appropriateness,"" the ""What Not To Wear"" style maven said of loose, knit ensembles. He's witnessed nothing less than a paradigm shift in Americans' concept of appropriate clothing over the past 10 years on ""What Not to Wear,"" as he helped 600 fashion victims learn to put their best face (and well-dressed-self) forward. But the allure of pajamas, yoga pants and track suits is strong. ""We are continuing, as a culture, on this downward spiral of style,"" Kelly said, ""I think that there will always be a group of people, a strong percentage of the population, who will care about their appearance. But now we have permission not to care."" What changed? He said it's that people no longer face the same social pressures they would have centuries ago, or even a couple decades ago. That social pressure, the unwritten rules about how someone should or should not dress, has always existed, said Susan Kaiser, a University of California, Davis, professor in textiles and clothing, and women and gender studies. ""Clothing has been described as a broadcast signal, the way it communicates,"" Kaiser said. ""We know (an appropriate outfit) when we see it. When something doesn't look quite right, then we notice that."" That knowledge is called a social norm, she said, and the norms surrounding fashion incorporate the function of clothing as well as the cultural attitudes of the day. ""We're a pretty Puritanic kind of country,"" Kaiser said. ""That has influenced our clothing a lot."" As a result, American social norms have always boiled down to modesty, she said. Colonists hardly showed any skin or even hair in public, an aspect of American dress that didn't change much until the 1900s. The notion of privacy has been intertwined with ideas of modesty since Colonial days as well, said Karen Herbaugh, the curator of the American Textile History Museum in Lowell, Massachusetts. While performing chores around the house or going to the market, ""(colonists) definitely would not have been wearing clothing that would have been considered private,"" Herbaugh said. ""They would have been wearing all the proper layers of clothing."" In Colonial times, that meant women would wear a chemise, a corset, a corset cover, a bodice, multiple layers of petticoats and then a dress, Herbaugh explained. ""And you would have been wearing that regardless of whether you saw someone else or not,"" she said. ""It just wouldn't have been appropriate otherwise."" The line between public and private clothing started to blur with the advent of the ""indoor wrapper"" during Victorian times, Herbaugh said. ""These were considered appropriate for a woman to wear to receive a woman friend at her house. They still were proper, they were just a little less restrictive,"" she said. Barely more formal than a robe, this precursor to the housecoat allowed women the opportunity to be in a semipublic situation without having to wear all the bustles and petticoats that public dress usually required. Men had their own version of wrappers as well, she said. Still, it's a far cry from the pajama-clad parents Herbaugh sees dropping children off at school. That boundary of public and private dress has moved from the house into the neighborhood, Kelly said. We no longer seek clues about appropriate dress from our community. These days, we look to celebrities, he said. ""I think that one photograph of one celebrity wearing something (inappropriate) can validate someone,"" he said. ""And they will leave the house wearing the same thing."" Before Cameron Diaz was photographed wearing Ugg boots, no one would have considered wearing them in public, he said. The cult of comfort is not only determined by stylish starlets, said Kaiser, the textiles professor. Clothing experienced a revolution in the 1960s, thanks to textiles such as polyester, rayon and spandex, as well as mass production technology. ""Rudi Gernreich, the famous designer in the '60s known for designing the one-piece topless bathing suit, was also known for doing a lot of knits,"" she said. ""He predicted that we would all be wearing, like, knit dancewear by now. And I think he's kind of right. ""We've become accustomed to a kind of comfort level in knits."" But the devil is in that forgiving detail of stretch, Kelly said. ""It's very easy in this country to do two things,"" he said. ""One: overeat. Two: wear really comfortable clothes. The problem is, when you combine both of those things you get caught in a spiral."" Large portions of cheap, overly processed foods keep us wearing stretchy, knit clothes -- that makes it easier to eat more large, overprocessed portions. ""I've heard this from women time after time: 'Before you know it, you've gained 30 pounds.' And then you get to a point where it's hopeless -- 'I can't lose 30 pounds.' "" What's next? ""You say, 'Uh, I give up,'"" he said. ""'I'll keep wearing my big comfy pants.'"" Would you wear pajamas or other ultracasual clothes outside the house? Tell us why or why not in the comments, on Twitter @CNNLiving or on CNN Living's Facebook page.","Today, it's socially acceptable to wear pajamas in public, if not always appropriate .

"(CNN) -- Oscar-winning actor Nicolas Cage went on a drunken tear in New Orleans' French Quarter Friday night that ended with his arrest on several charges, including domestic abuse battery, according to a police spokesman. It began at 11:30 p.m. when Cage, who is in the city to work on a movie, began arguing with his wife on the 600 block of Dumaine Street, New Orleans Police Officer Garry Flot said. ""He and his wife were standing in front of a residence that he insisted was the property the couple was renting,"" Flot said.  ""She disagreed, and Cage grabbed her by the upper arm and pulled her to what he believed was the correct address."" Cage then ""began striking vehicles and later attempted to get into a taxi."" Police, who had been called by on-lookers, arrived to find Cage heavily intoxicated,"" he said.  They ordered the actor out of the cab, ""which prompted Cage to start yelling,"" Flot said. ""The officers subsequently took Cage to Central Lock-Up,"" the police spokesman said. In the mugshot released by the Orleans Parish Sheriff, an unshaven Cage stood with eyes closed. Cage was charged with domestic abuse battery, disturbing the peace and public drunkenness, Flot said. An Orleans Parish magistrate set his bond at $11,000 with a court date for May 31, according to the booking information online. It also said ""stay away order waived,"" indicating Cage is not prohibited from being with his wife. ""There were no visible signs of injury on his wife's arm,"" Flot said. Cage was released from jail Saturday afternoon, according to the jail's information line. Duane Chapman -- known as ""Dog the Bounty Hunter"" from the A&E reality show chronicling his life -- bailed Cage out of jail, he said in a statement. While he called himself ""a truly dedicated fan of Mr. Cage,"" Chapman insisted he was simply doing his job ""as a bail bondsman and not in connection with our show."" ""There are two sides of my job: I release my clients after they have been arrested, and pick them up if they don't show up in court,"" Chapman said. ""I do not believe the latter will be the case for Mr. Cage."" Calls and e-mails from CNN to the actor's lawyer and representative have not been returned. Cage, 47, and his third wife, Alice Kim, have a 5-year-old son. His previous two marriages, to Patricia Arquette and Lisa Marie Presley, ended in divorce. The Academy Award winner has acted in dozens of films, but is best known for his roles in ""Raising Arizona"" and ""Leaving Las Vegas,"" for which he nabbed an Oscar. Although one of Hollywood's highest-paid movie stars, Cage's financial troubles, including tax liens and foreclosures on houses, have been highly publicized in the past two years. He sued his accountant in 2009, charging that he ""lined his pockets with several million dollars in business management fees while sending Cage down a path toward financial ruin."" The accountant, Samuel Levin, responding to the lawsuit by saying he warned Cage that he could face bankruptcy unless he scaled back his lavish lifestyle. CNN's KJ Matthews contributed to this report.","NEW: ""Dog the Bounty Hunter"" bails Cage out of a New Orleans jail .

"(CNN) -- They were warned not to share it, but share it they did. Australians, intrigued by the latest revelation from WikiLeaks, took to social media to pass on a document they were never meant to see. On Wednesday morning, the whistleblowing group, headed by Julian Assange, broke a suppression order, which was itself subject to a suppression order. In the United Kingdom, such an order is known as a super-injunction, and is used by judges to ensure secrecy around specific events. And many people talking about the case on Twitter used the hashtag #superinjunction. This one involves a court case, international politicians and allegations that a Supreme Court judge in the Australian state of Victoria deemed should not be repeated. The Victorian Supreme Court declined to comment on the matter to CNN. On its website, WikiLeaks provided more information -- enough to see those responsible for breaking the order prosecuted in an Australian court, one expert said. ""They [Wikileaks] have put themselves in the position of judge, jury and executioner,"" said Peter Bartlett, a media lawyer from Minter Ellison law firm in Melbourne. ""The difficulty for the court is that WikiLeaks is not, of course, in the jurisdiction of Australia,"" he said. ""If Assange ever comes back to Australia, you would expect that he would immediately be charged with breaking a suppression order."" Assange remains holed up in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London where he sought political asylum two years ago after publishing reams of classified U.S. documents online. He's wanted for questioning over allegations of sexual assault in Sweden, which he claims are politically motivated. Talk of the broken suppression order spread quickly online. Some blatantly shared the link to the WikiLeaks release, while others adopted a more cautious stance. One journalist tweeted: ""If, hypothetically, you go to the @Wikileaks site, & I'm not suggesting you do, you might find something interesting I can't talk about."" Suppression orders are relatively common in the state of Victoria, according to a recent study. The report found that in the five years between 2008 and 2012, Victorian courts issued 1,501 suppression orders, including 281 in the Supreme Court. In its annual report into the state of press freedom in Australia, the Media & Entertainment Arts Alliance referred to Victoria as ""the suppression order capital of Australia."" ""These laws are quite draconian,"" said Chris Nash, a professor of journalism at Monash University in Melbourne, and the former director of the Australian Centre for Independent Journalism. Courts have been known to act when the orders are breached. Last year, former broadcaster Derryn Hinch was found guilty of contempt of court and fined $100,000 for contravening an order. The presenter didn't immediately delete a blog he had published about an alleged killer's criminal past after a judge imposed a suppression order during the murder trial.","WikiLeaks publishes suppression order imposed by Victorian Supreme Court .

"(CNN) -- On his HBO talk show, ""Last Week Tonight,"" comedian John Oliver aired a blistering segment about President Obama and the issue of income inequality. Oliver reminded viewers that ""last December, the president made it clear that income inequality"" would be a ""big priority,"" since in a speech he called it the ""defining challenge of our time."" The segment continued with clips of media pundits saying that the battle against income inequality had finally begun and that an ""all-out assault"" on this problem was inevitable. Oliver joked that income inequality had better watch out, since it was going to be ""violently ameliorated"" -- or, he explains, it would have been if Democrats had not ""immediately backed down."" Instead of a war on inequality, he said, the issue became another topic that Americans like to avoid (like Japanese internment camps or the time we gave Roberto Benigni an Oscar ). Oliver is on to something important. No matter how many times Democrats bring up the issue, they just can't seem to commit to a fight on income inequality. Inequality can be a winning issue . Such a retreat is not inevitable. The conventional argument that the U.S. is just a center-right country doesn't hold water. In most polls, there is clear evidence of strong support for policies that deal with inequality, such as a higher minimum wage or tax cuts that will stimulate job growth, as well as limits on the tax benefits enjoyed by companies that invest overseas. When asked whether they dislike government, Americans often say yes. But when asked about whether they like specific policies that combat inequality, they also respond favorably. Whenever Republicans have tried to take a big bite out of programs that create some kind of social safety net, like Social Security, they have faced a huge backlash. Just ask former President George W. Bush, who watched his political capital burn away in 2005 when he attempted to privatize Social Security. The Democrats have a strong party tradition during the New Deal and Great Society of making great electoral gains when they focus on these kinds of questions. To be sure, there are some Democrats who have insisted on moving forward with this issue despite the perceived political risks. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has been extremely aggressive in tackling inequality. In a recent trip to West Virginia, Warren excited Democrats when she told them to ask Republicans, ""Who do you work for? Do you work for those who hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers? Do you work for the millionaires and billionaires who've already made it big?"" Early in his administration, President Obama was more determined to move forward with this issue, as was evident with the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and his advocacy of pay equity. Hesitating on inequality issue . Yet it also true that Democrats quickly get skittish when bringing up these issues. They have hesitated to make this a central issue for the party, and they have avoided going after Republicans on the topic while branding themselves as the party that will help the middle class regain its mojo. Since calling inequality the ""defining issue of our time"" in December, President Obama has consciously backed off even talking about the issue. In June, the Washington Post published a revealing piece documenting how he abandoned the issue despite his bold talk last year. He shifted from talking about the persistence of income inequality that results from our public policies and structure of our economy to a more optimistic trope of offering ways to boost the middle class. ""Both the White House and the Senate agreed that the decline of middle-class incomes was the most serious issues we face in this country,"" Sen. Charles Schumer was quoted as saying in the story, ""but the focus had to be on how to get middle-class incomes up, rather than drive other people's incomes down."" Even when policies are difficult to pass in Congress, at a minimum, a president has the power to keep talking about an issue and try to make it central in the national conversation. This is particularly important with controversial issues like inequality. Yet he has decided not to use the power of the bully pulpit for this purpose. Lacking self-confidence . So why is this the case? The most important is that Democrats as a party lack self-confidence. Ever since the 1970s, they have been a party that often thinks their opponents are winning, even when they are not, and for several decades they have accepted the terms for the debate laid out by the GOP. In 1976, Jimmy Carter ran as a Democrat who embraced conservative arguments about reforming bureaucracy and balancing the budget, someone who would challenge party stalwarts like organized labor. During his presidency, Bill Clinton, who ran as part of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council, stressed the virtues of free markets and agreed to end the public welfare system that had been created in 1935. Though Obama started his presidency with the promise to embrace progressive ideals, he has backed away from this kind of outlook and very often toed a centrist line. He has avoided any serious discussion of progressive tax reform that would raise more income from the wealthy, other than his decision to allow the tax cuts on the very wealthiest Americans to expire, or much tougher regulatory actions against Wall Street to prevent the kind of leakage that has been characteristic of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The original law itself was written in a way that created huge openings for financial institutions to circumvent the regulations. There has been insufficient attention to public investment in new industries that could provide more well-paying jobs. Obama has maintained a tepid relation with unions, usually considered the best bulwark against inequality in the 20th century. Strengthening the bargaining power of workers and protecting union members from fear of being fired has been a failed fight in recent years. Obama, and other presidents, have not stood by the unions. In short, Democrats have been scared to embrace their own tradition. Campaign dollars play a role . Democrats have also faced a loaded political process that doesn't favor these kinds of policies. The existing campaign finance and lobbying system, which has greatly empowered corporate interests and wealthier Americans, makes it hard to actually fight for policies that reduce inequality. To run their campaigns, Democrats need many millions of dollars from Wall Street and corporate interests that would oppose policies that significantly reduce inequality. Democrats, including Obama, have generally given up on the issue of campaign finance and lobbying reform, and the playing field remains skewed against equality. When the financial crisis happened in 2008, despite enormous public support for muscular regulatory policies, members of both parties backed down, in part a response to the power of Wall Street. Even today, Democrats might talk about tougher tax policies toward corporations, but such changes are very hard to pass through Congress when they confront the corporate power in Washington. Democrats have not been very successful working with this issue in the modern media environment. Oliver astutely plays clips of Fox News broadcasts that followed Obama's speech on inequality, showing talking heads and hosts castigating the president for launching ""class warfare."" The kinds of measures that have generally been discussed at this point, such as raising the minimum wage, are a far cry from class warfare. Yet conservatives have been very effective at instantly spreading this message the minute the topic arises. Democrats have not offered and sold an effective response, one that shows that dealing with economic security is not radical at all but very much part of the political tradition. A question for Hillary Clinton . When they downplay inequality as an issue, Democrats are making a big political mistake. Hillary Clinton, who is thinking of launching a presidential run, should know this better than anyone. Her most powerful moments in the 2008 primaries came when she appealed to blue-collar Americans who were working hard and not getting ahead. This was the single issue that allowed her to light up on the campaign trail. With some skeptics saying that her ties to Wall Street will compromise her on this issue, Clinton will need to push back -- as she did with a recent speech at the New America Foundation -- and demonstrate that she is a Democrat who will fight for strengthening the middle class. Right now, Democrats should probably take a close look at the agenda put forth by their colleagues in the House. Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi proposed an agenda she would champion for the first 100 days in the unlikely event the Democrats regain control of the House in November. It includes a minimum wage increase, equal pay legislation, cutting special tax breaks for corporations and more. These proposals are a step forward, though they clearly fall short of measures that will be able to truly reverse income inequality. For that, they will need presidential support and a party commitment to follow through. Tackling inequality has always been a way for Democrats to strengthen their political coalition of African-Americans, blue-collar and middle-class workers and wealthier progressives. This is the issue that has always bound the party together. Democrats have a huge opportunity to make gains, given the current agenda of the Republican Party. Despite all the talk of conservative populism, the fact is that Republican economic policies have been biased toward wealthier segments of the population. But if Democrats are going to really move forward with these issues, they will have to avoid the mistakes that have bogged down these efforts in previous years. If they don't change their ways, the Democratic fight on income inequality will remain a punch line on comedy shows and a rallying cry for Republicans who want to paint Democrats as too far left of center.

"Ansan, South Korea (CNN) -- They came to pay their respects to a young man who saved the lives of many but who lost his own. After two days of official mourning, the funeral of Choi Duk-Ha, the 17-year-old student who first raised the alarm that his ferry was sinking, was held on Sunday. His call to emergency services gave rescuers a precious few extra minutes to get to the stricken Sewol and get passengers off as it is listed dangerously before capsizing and sinking off the coast of South Korea on the morning of April 15. Duk-Ha made that call at the expense of calling his own parents. They never heard from him again. ""My boy was pure in heart. He was so innocent. It was probably only nature for him to have called 119 first,"" his mother Kim Sang-Hee said. Wearing a black mourning hanbok, Kim and her husband Choi Sung-Woong have led a traditional three-day funeral, which ended Sunday morning with a service at the Ansan Catholic cathedral. Hundreds of friends, community leaders and well-wishers passed through the funeral home in the city of Ansan to offer prayers and to light incense as nuns and friends sang prayers for the departed. Kim and Sung-Woong are still trying to come to terms with the loss of their youngest child and only son. Duk-Ha was one of 325 students from Danwon High School who boarded the ferry bound for Jeju. Only 78 returned. ""He was unusually excited and incredibly happy to be going. I was so happy because he was, so I bid him farewell in the morning wishing him a good trip but it ended this way. My heart is broken,"" Kim said. On that fateful Wednesday morning, emergency services received a call from Duk-Ha saying that the ferry was sinking. It was a full three minutes before the vessel's crew alerted the emergency services. He is being hailed as a hero in South Korea for saving lives with that call. ""I was so surprised when I heard about Duk-Ha making that first call,"" his father said. ""We were wondering why he was not calling us when most of the kids were calling their mums and dads when the accident happened. It was not until later when we heard from the media what he had done. He has always had leadership qualities. Now I am very proud of him. Although he made a sacrifice he saved many lives."" Their faith helps the pain of such a devastating loss. ""My Duk-Ha has done many good deeds. We believe God brought Duk-Ha to this life for this purpose,"" his father said. As happens so often in tragedies like this, some of the ferry survivors have felt guilty to be alive when so many others are not -- but Duk-Ha's parents had a poignant message for them. ""It breaks my heart to think about the suffering that all the children went through. My child has gone to heaven but the children who survived must grow up to be adults. I want them to overcome the pain and move on and live a full life for their sake and for the sake of the children who did not make it,"" said Kim. Her husband added: ""I am past the point of hating or blaming anyone. I hope that we can let that go."" The local government has asked the state if Duk-Ha can be buried at the national cemetery, which honors political and military leaders and citizens who gave their lives to help others. His parents say they don't yet know where his final resting place will be. For the next few days his cremated remains will lie at the Ansan gymnasium, a temporary memorial site, where thousands of local people continue to pay their last respects to the lost sons and daughters of Ansan.

"(CNN) -- Even as she prays for her husband's recovery, Debbie Sacra wants to remind the world that there are thousands dying in West Africa of the deadly Ebola virus. Dr. Rick Sacra is the latest American to become infected with the Ebola virus while working in Liberia for the aid organization Serving in Mission. He was admitted to an Ebola case management center over the weekend near the hospital in Monrovia where he has served for 15 years. ""I am surrounded by friends and family and the body of Christ, who are a great encouragement and who are praying fervently for Rick's recovery along with me,"" Debbie Sacra said in a statement. ""We are trusting in God to be with Rick and us through this difficult circumstance. ""Rick would want me to urge you to remember that there are many people in Liberia who are suffering in this epidemic and others who are not receiving standard health care because clinics and hospitals have been forced to close. West Africa is on the verge of a humanitarian crisis, and the world needs to respond compassionately and generously."" Sacra had been to Liberia with SIM before, and volunteered to go again after he heard fellow missionaries Nancy Writebol and Dr. Kent Brantly had contracted the virus, SIM President Bruce Johnson said. Writebol spoke publicly for the first time about her ordeal at a news conference on Wednesday. From Charlotte, North Carolina, she thanked God, her family, and health care workers in Liberia and Atlanta for nursing her back to health. ""I'm so grateful that this beautiful woman is still with me,"" her husband David said. ""She is the best part of my life... I love her with all my heart."" Brantly: 'I felt like I was about to die' Sacra's story . Sacra, 51, is from Holden, Massachusetts. He was not directly treating Ebola patients in Liberia during this trip, but was delivering babies at a general hospital in Monrovia, Johnson said. The doctor started to show symptoms of haemorrhagic fever on Friday evening. Health care workers did an Ebola test on Monday, which came back positive for the deadly virus. Sacra was following all protocols and taking all necessary precautions against Ebola, Johnson said. It is unclear how he became infected, but SIM is working with the CDC to determine the point of contact. When asked if the organization was going to bring Sacra back to the United States for treatment, Johnson said all options were being explored. Sacra is not likely to receive ZMapp, the experimental drug given to Writebol and Brantly, as there are no more doses available. But with supportive care, the doctor could very well recover. While Ebola can be deadly in up to 90% of cases, about half the people in this current outbreak have survived. ""Dr. Jerry Brown, Dr. Sacra's Liberian colleague, has overseen the care and cure of many Ebola virus disease patients in Liberia, and I trust his expertise,"" Debbie Sacra said. Writebol's story . There were mornings in Liberia, as Writebol fought off the deadly Ebola virus, when she woke up and thought with surprise, ""I'm alive."" Writebol was diagnosed on July 25. She originally thought she had malaria, she said, and took medication to fight off the mosquito-borne disease. But even after the round of medication was completed, the symptoms persisted. A doctor took a blood sample for an Ebola test ""just to make sure"" and it came back positive. When she found out, Writebol told her husband it was going to be OK. But ""I had no clue what was going to happen,"" she said. Writebol and Brantly were flown from Liberia to be treated at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta in early August. As she was being boarded onto the plane, she thought, ""I don't even know if I'm going to make it to the U.S."" She said she remembers little else about the moments before the flight, other than a doctor in protective clothing putting his hands around her face and saying, ""Nancy, you're going home."" At Emory, Writebol was still in pain -- unable to move her legs or feet. But one day, she said, she pushed herself to get out of bed and take a shower. From that point on, doctors saw small signs of progress. Writebol and Brantly were released from the Atlanta hospital two weeks ago, just days apart. When asked what she thinks may have saved her -- The experimental drug? The dedicated health care workers in Liberia and Atlanta? Her faith? -- Writebol answered, ""All of the above."" Writebol, whose missionary work includes 14 years of aiding orphans and vulnerable children in Africa, was in Liberia with the aid organization Serving in Mission. She and her husband arrived there in August 2013. She guided missionaries and teams and worked with nurses at ELWA hospital in the capital of Monrovia, where her husband is the technical services manager, according to the Christian group's website. The fact that the Writebols left the comforts of America to live in an area rife with poverty, instability and disease, and put their lives at risk to assist those suffering everyday, doesn't surprise those who know them. John Munro, their friend and pastor at Calvary Church in Charlotte, described the couple as ""the salt of the Earth,"" the kind of people who wouldn't give a second thought to dropping everything to help. The only thing perhaps ironic about what's happening now is how such an ""unassuming"" and ""very humble"" woman has become international news. ""She is ... not someone who would ever make the headlines,"" Munro said, ""apart from something like this."" Married for 40 years, the Writebols have traveled the globe, focused on their faith and their desire to help others. Wherever they've gone, their lives have been centered on their church and their family, including two now-adult sons who live in the United States. Ebola might have derailed them, but it hasn't changed their purpose in life. ""We aren't going to stop our ministry,"" David Writebol said last month. ""We believe we can serve wherever God sends us."" For now, the couple is going to enjoy spending time with their children and grandchildren. Writebol said she ""can't wait"" to put her arms around her family.

The man, described as an amateur explorer who wants to remain anonymous, unearthed a 5.5 kilogram golden nugget 60 centimeters in the ground outside Ballarat, a city about an hour and a half drive west of Melbourne. Experts say the value of the find is at least $300,000. ""He came in to my shop at 12:30 p.m. on Wednesday and had a grin from ear to ear,"" Cordell Kent, owner of The Mining Exchange Gold Shop, told CNN. ""His eyes were sparkling."" The 47-year resident of Ballarat says that gold has been continuously found in the region since 1851, but technology has recently become an essential aid for modern prospectors. ""In the last 10 years it's gotten very, very hard to find nuggets over a kilo, so this (5.5 kilogram) one is extremely rare,"" says Kent. ""In the old days miners could only see or feel gold - but now with detectors they can hear it."" A Minelab GPX Model 5000 metal detector was used to find the nugget, Kent says. In Australia, the machine retails for nearly $7,000, according to Gary Shmith, Minelab's General Manager for the Asia Pacific. Shmith expects collectors may already be eyeing a potential purchase of the Ballarat nugget because of its rarity. ""My guess is that it would sell at 20% or 30% above its weight in gold. A nice, small nugget would already sell for 10% to 15% above its weight in gold."" Kent says the lucky prospector is back at work, ""detecting right as we speak."" ""He doesn't want anyone to know his bit of ground. There are only four people who know that he found it -- he and his wife and me and my wife. And he's hoping the one he found this week is a small piece and that there are bigger ones still out there."" While many people in the region have been searching for gold for decades, Kent's friend only started last year. Other prospectors - old and new - will hope that they will be as lucky.","Amateur Australian prospector unearths 5.5 kilogram golden nugget .

"Dallas (CNN) -- Some may disagree whether George W. Bush was a ""uniter, not a divider,"" as he liked to say, but he did get all five living presidents together for the dedication of his presidential library. At Thursday's event in Dallas, Democratic former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton praised Bush for his initiatives in Africa, and Bush defended his record. ""The political winds blow left and right, polls rise and fall, supporters come and go, but in the end, leaders are defined by the convictions they hold,"" Bush said at the ceremony for the George W. Bush Presidential Center. ""My deepest conviction, the guiding principle of the administration, is that the United States of America must strive to expand the reach of freedom."" Bush has said he is aware that the opening of his presidential library would reopen debates over the Iraq War and the policies he pursued after the September 11 terrorist attacks. History will show, he said at the dedication, that he always stuck by his convictions. ""A free society thrives when neighbors help neighbors and the strong protect the weak and public policies promote private compassion,"" Bush said. ""As president, I tried to act on these principles every day. It wasn't always easy and certainly wasn't always popular ... but when future generations come to this library to study this administration, they're going to find out that we stayed true to our convictions."" Carter told a story of how he asked, on Bush's inauguration day, for a meeting to talk about a civil war in Sudan that was entering its second decade. Bush kept his word and acted, Carter said. ""In January of 2005, there was a peace treaty between north and south Sudan that ended a war that had been going on for 20 years,"" Carter said. ""George W. Bush is responsible for that."" The last time the five living presidents were together was right before President Obama took office. It is a rare and special occurrence when the five gather, Obama said. ""This is a Texas-sized party,"" Obama said. ""When all the former living presidents are all together, it is a special day for our democracy."" The presidents on the stage definitely differed on many policy matters, but they all share one quality, Obama said: They did what they believe is right. ""That's what President George W. Bush chose to do,"" Obama said. Bush became a little emotional as he closed his speech: ""Whatever challenges come before us, I will always believe our nation's best days lie ahead."" The center's library and museum take visitors through the turning points of Bush's two terms. The first exhibits recall the 43rd president's initial priorities on education, faith-based community initiatives and tax cuts. And they show how the September 11 terrorist attacks changed everything. Bush 43: 'History will ultimately judge' At one exhibit, the bright red dress that first lady Laura Bush wore to her husband's first state dinner, just six days before 9/11, stands in contrast to the next, most talked-about artifact in the museum: the twisted hulk of two beams from the World Trade Center. In an interview with CNN's John King, the former president said he knows that the center's dedication will rekindle the debate about his presidency, and he conceded the library is in part an effort by him and supporters to influence history's verdict. But he predicted visitors would find it ""more objective"" than they might have imagined, and he showed little interest in revisiting flashpoints like Iraq, Hurricane Katrina or the 2008 financial crisis, or the scorn with which many look back at the Bush presidency. A glimpse at a White House before everything changed . ""You know, I'm really not that concerned about why people did what during my presidency,"" he said. ""I'm more concerned about being an effective person for the rest of my life. ""I know this: that Laura and I gave the presidency eight years of our life. We gave it our all. Made the best judgment calls I could. I didn't compromise my principles. And I'm a content man. And I am excited about what we're going to do here."" As the son of another former president, Bush said he wouldn't mind seeing his brother Jeb Bush run for the highest office. If he could make the decision for Jeb, he would tell him to run for president, Bush said. But in an interview Thursday on NBC's ""Today,"" former first lady Barbara Bush said that while Jeb Bush is able to do the job, she would like to see other families in the White House. ""There are other people out there that are very qualified, and we've had enough Bushes,"" she said. In addition to the library and museum, the Presidential Center includes the George W. Bush Institute, a public policy institute. By the numbers: Presidential libraries . CNN's Mariano Castillo wrote and reported this story in Atlanta.

"(CNN) -- Argentine football star Carlos Tevez has thanked his fans for their support following his father's kidnap ordeal in Buenos Aires. Segundo Tevez was captured while driving his car in the district of MorÃ³n, around 20 kilometers west of the center of the Argentine capital, on Tuesday morning before being released later in the day, according to state news agency Telam. Tevez, who plays for Italian champion Juventus, later confirmed the news of his father's release and thanked fans for their messages of support on his official Facebook page. ""Thank you all for the support as always. I tell you that my father is well, safe and sound. This is the most important!"" Local media also reported that a ransom of 400,000 Argentine pesos ($49,000) was paid for his father's release. Tevez had planned to fly back to Argentina upon hearing the news of the abduction, but will now stay in Italy as Juventus prepares to start its Serie A title at the end of August. A statement on the club's official website read: ""Carlos Tevez will remain in Turin after receiving the news that his father, kidnapped during the night on the outskirts of Buenos Aires, has now been set free. ""The striker was all set to return to his homeland after leave of absence had been granted by the club, but will now continue his preseason preparations at Juventus Center, where he is due to train (on Wednesday)."" Tevez joined Juve from English Premier League side Manchester City in June 2013 and scored 19 goals last season as the team romped to a 30th league title, finishing a record-breaking 17 points clear of second-placed Roma. Tevez did not play at the 2014 World Cup, where Argentina lost in the final -- the last of his 64 international appearances was in 2011.

"(CNN) -- I believe it was December of '98 when my dad passed away of an overdose. A few weeks later, around my 10th birthday, I was diagnosed with Tourette syndrome and Asperger's syndrome. It was a really rough time, especially at that age, being told I have a neurological ""disease,"" when I already felt so different. At that point I was being bullied for being different, having big ears, and now for having no dad AND for making weird faces and noises I couldn't control. I was a walking target. Then my mom discovered a musical interest in me after my older sister was in musical theater at her high school. I learned all the songs from the show ""Damn Yankees"" and at the final performance, the director let me go onstage (my first time onstage) and perform with the cast! I was hooked instantly and for some reason it felt right. Although I felt I had found ""my place,"" I still had to go back to my own school. The bullying just kept getting worse. I didn't know what to do anymore. I remember I even had thoughts of suicide and hurting myself. When I turned 12, I was given a hand-me-down guitar and a chord book. I studied those basic chords and learned how to play the basic songs. Throughout this process, I figured out that no matter how bad of a day I had at school, I could come home and create my own world within the music. I could make the music as happy or as sad as I wanted it to be. I used the pain from being bullied to transform me into who I was meant to be. I knew where I was most comfortable -- on stage. But I couldn't always be there, and not everyone respected my happiness. Durbin on 'Dr. Drew' The bullying didn't end there. It just kept happening. It got so bad that I dropped out of high school. I got to the point where I couldn't even focus in class because of the pestering. I told the school officials about the bullying and they did what they could, but I would rather be sitting on my butt at home than being bullied and beat up at school. A couple of years later, I met an angel who would turn out to be my beautiful wife, Heidi. I was a dropout: No job, no license, no car, no aspirations. She had a diploma, three jobs, a car AND goals. Having someone in my life who really believed in me made me believe in myself. We started dating, and I started to progress. I started a band and found a job, got my license, and soon afterward got my GED. In the midst of it all, we found out that we were expecting our sweet son Hunter. That right there is the proudest moment of my life and no famous game show or extravaganza concert can top that. Ever. Heidi and Hunter balance me. Through my adventures and heartache on ""American Idol,"" to the adventures and heartache on the road of rock 'n roll, they have always supported me. And when I'm home, I'm just Daddy. With whatever ""celebrity status"" I have thanks to ""American Idol,"" I really want to use it for a good purpose. I've always been a huge fan of WWE and pro wrestling. I was approached by them after ""Idol"" to be a part of their anti-bullying campaign B.A. Star. Since then I have participated in several in-school rallies to talk to kids about my experiences being bullied and how I've overcome them to be the man I am today. Regrets? I've had a few... but then again, too few to mention, haha.","James Durbin appeared on the 10th season of ""American Idol""

"(CNN) -- Actress Molly Glynn, who played an emergency room doctor on several ""Chicago Fire"" episodes, died from injuries after a tree fell on her during a storm, her husband said. Glynn, 46, was on a bike ride on a suburban Chicago trail with her husband, Joe Foust, when the accident happened, Foust said in a Facebook posting Friday afternoon. ""Friends, this is the darkest day of my life,"" Foust, also an actor, wrote. ""Things will never be the same. Molly got hit by a falling tree while we were biking. At hospital now. Prognosis is grim."" The Chicago Tribune quotes Foust saying the tree was knocked over by high winds when a storm erupted Friday afternoon. Glynn died from her injuries in an Evanston, Illinois, hospital Saturday. ""I couldn't save her,"" Foust wrote to friends Saturday. ""I couldn't save her. She's gone."" The Cook County, Illinois, coroner's office was conducting an autopsy Monday to confirm the cause of death, an investigator told CNN. While Glynn acted in several roles on television and in film, most of her acting career was spent on the stages of Chicago. Her death has hit the Chicago theater community hard. An online fundraising effort quickly collected nearly $135,000 for her husband, who revealed on Facebook that the couple ""had less than 70 bucks in the bank.""

"(CNN) -- One week ago, the Michigan House of Representatives was taking up some of the most restrictive anti-choice legislation in the country. It was in the context of this bill that I said, ""Finally Mr. Speaker, I'm flattered that you're all so interested in my vagina, but 'no' means 'no.'"" You can watch me say that here. My comment is made around the 1:50 mark, and you can see exactly how the legislators seated behind me reacted. While there was a scatter of applause from my colleagues, there were no dropped jaws, bulging eyes or fainting. In fact, the only remarkable thing about their response is that there was virtually no response at all. Not until the next day. That's when I got word that Republican House leaders had banned me and my colleague Rep. Barb Byrum from speaking on the House floor. I was shocked. Given my speech, I could only assume it was because I spoke to my Jewish values or because I had said vagina. But later that day, Rep. Mike Callton told the press that what I had said was so vile, so disgusting, that he could never bear to mention it in front of women or ""mixed company."" Since we share the same religion, I'm guessing he wasn't referring to my kosher sets of dishes. Even though Callton has a bachelor's degree in biology and worked as a chiropractor, it was the word ""vagina"" that did him in. As a storm of protest grew against our silencing and women across the state started to rally around my use of the word vagina, Republicans changed course. They insisted they had no problem with vaginas. Byrum and I were being punished for our lack of decorum. We were accused of throwing a ""temper tantrum."" Take another look at the video. Do you see a temper tantrum? Does that look like a group of people shocked by what we said or how we behaved? Vagina enters stage left -- or is it right? When complaints about our banning picked up pace, Republicans tried again. This time, their story was that I was kept from speaking because I said ""no means no."" As Republicans continued to throw mud against the wall to see what stuck, they only made it worse for themselves. Thousands of women, not only in Michigan but across the country and even around the globe, saw exactly what was going on. What they saw was a male-dominated legislative body going to great lengths to silence two women who dared speak in opposition to a measure that would limit access to our health care. They saw it, and they didn't like it. Among the people watching this unfold was Eve Ensler, who wrote the award-winning play, ""The Vagina Monologues."" Ensler, who has worked for nearly 20 years to empower women and undo the shame many of us are taught to feel toward our bodies, didn't just see a group of mostly male legislators freaking out about ""vagina."" She saw them trying to shut women up at the same time they were trying to pass laws about our health. She wouldn't stand for it. That's why she came to Lansing this week to lead a performance of ""The Vagina Monologues."" Thousands of men, women and children showed up to see it and show their support for Byrum and me. In the aftermath of this, Rep. Jim Stamas, whose job it was to issue the edict against me, said he ""honestly had no idea it would become such an issue."" I find it amazing that a fellow legislator wouldn't understand why it's outrageous not to just silence me, but my 90,000 constituents. I hope he and his fellow Republicans get it now. If not, the election this November will surprise them even more. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Lisa Brown.","Michigan state Rep.

"New York (CNN) -- The 27-year-old son of tennis great John McEnroe and Academy Award-winning actress Tatum O'Neal was arrested on drug charges in Manhattan, police said. Kevin McEnroe was arrested late Tuesday after what police believed was a drug transaction on a street corner in East Village, according to New York police Sgt. Jessica McRorie. He was charged with two counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance. McEnroe was carrying six clear plastic bags of what was believed to be cocaine, a Clorazepate anxiety pill, 20 Oxycodone pain-killing pills, 10 morphine pills and 10 orange pills which were not identified, McRorie said. McEnroe was arraigned Wednesday in Manhattan Criminal Court. Prosecutors asked that bail be set at $5,000 but a judge released McEnroe on his own recognizance. He is to appear in court on October 16. His lawyer, Isabelle Kirshner, declined to comment. A second man also was arrested, a law enforcement official said . McEnroe's mother, Tatum O'Neal, was arrested in 2008 on misdemeanor drug possession charges in Manhattan after allegedly buying crack cocaine. O'Neal, who wrote a 2004 memoir about her long road to sobriety, pleaded guilty to a lesser charge. At 10, she won an Oscar for best supporting actress in the movie ""Paper Moon."" She is the daughter of actor Ryan O'Neal, who starred in the 1973 film. She is the ex-wife of McEnroe, with whom she has three children. Robert Downey Jr.'s son Indio arrested on drug charges .

"(CNN) -- A car decked out with blinking disco lights and a fog machine is driving the streets of San Francisco at night. In the back are paying passengers belting out karaoke tunes. In the front is the at-least locally recognizable Lyft pink mustache outlined with LED lights. DiscoLyft (yes, of course he's on Twitter) is one of the many personalized, and eccentric, cars popping up as part of the growing Lyft ride-sharing service, which is now active in San Francisco, Boston, Los Angeles and Seattle. Using the Lyft app, anyone with a Facebook account can book and pay for a ride with one of the Lyft drivers, like a more casual and kooky Uber. The oversized, fluffy mustaches affixed to car grills started as a smart marketing gambit. But the silly accessory and Lyft's social-focused approach ended up infusing the makeshift fleet with peppy, perky and chatty personality and attracting outgoing drivers. During orientation, drivers are encouraged to express themselves with their vehicles, to join Twitter and to offer something extra to passengers, like candy. ""We really want everyone to have this opportunity to explore their creativity with Lyft,"" said Lyft co-founder John Zimmer. Sometimes it's the car that's decorated. Grant Gordon's chalkboard-paint covered car, which was originally made for the Burning Man festival, is covered in doodles from riders and passersby. Some cars have games and other diversions; the Magnetic Poetry car keeps a Tumblr of rider's poems. All Lyft cars offer an array of smartphone chargers, but many drivers give out more than electricity. There are savory and sweet treats, tchotchkes and fruit. PK Rodriguez, a San Francisco driver, makes custom goodie bags filled with candy and cards bearing handwritten inspirational quotes that she says helped her get through a recent motorcycle accident (she was a passenger). Not to be outdone by their cars, the Lyft drivers can be equally over the top. In Los Angeles, there is a driver who dresses like Batman. ""Lyft is all about being the friend with the car, treating that person as if they were a friend of yours,"" said Lyft co-founder John Zimmer. Friends don't let friends sit quietly in the back seat playing Candy Crush while they give you a ride home from happy hour. Lyft rides are supposed to be social activities. Drivers are trained to greet riders with a fist bump as a way of breaking the ice. (Ice is very un-Lyft like.) Passengers are encouraged to sit in the front seat so they can make small talk. The job appeals to artists, actors, DJs, and singers who want to fund their fledgling careers with flexible part-time work using their cars. Classical singer Juliana Urban fits in a full 40 hours a week around auditions. She stocks her car with clementines and Capri Suns and says the conversations and random connections she makes driving for Lyft are the best part of the job. Snacks are big with Lyft drivers, but few have taken it as far as entrepreneur and Lyft driver Chris Biggs -- aka Cookie Wars Lyft. In the morning, Biggs bakes two batches of cookies and packs them in Tupperware. Riders taste each flavor and vote for their favorites. The winning cookie is announced on Twitter and the cookie goes on to compete against a new recipe the next day. Angel Lozano, 35, is still in the Navy full-time, but picks up Lyft shifts in the evening. His spotless Range Rover is posh enough to pass for an Uber, with new upholstery, a custom sound system and TV screens that allow passengers to sit back and enjoy episodes of ""Chappelle's Show."" There are others like Hip Hop Lyft, a ""Ghostbusters""-themed car, and Giants Lyft. The vehicles range from scrubby Honda Civics to higher-end luxury vehicles. There are even a Jaguar and a Tesla. The @Lyft_Diaries Twitter account keeps tabs on some of the more notable rider experiences and tweeting drivers. The Lyft app doesn't let people choose which car they'll ride in, but the extra personality can still have a financial up-side. Using the Lyft app, passengers choose how much to pay to the driver after their ride and can increase or decrease the suggested amount based on how they felt about the experience. (Lyft drivers don't see how much they were paid until the end of their shifts.) In many ways, Lyft is the opposite of the original Bay Area community ride-sharing experience, a casual carpool. The loose network of strangers who grab rush-hour rides at preset stops has its own unwritten rules: The radio should be set to NPR and played at a soothingly low volume, and silence is golden. Uber, which recently ran anti-Lyft ads that said ""Shave the stache,"" sticks to the usual car service etiquette. Cars are clean and un-adorned, riders are in the back and conversation is optional. Sidecar is a service similar to Lyft and also asks passengers to sit up front, but it hasn't seen the same boom in creativity from drivers. A highly social ride isn't for everyone. Many people who want peace and quiet or a luxury, shiny black car will stick with car companies or Uber. Shy people aren't the only ones who don't enjoy Lyft. Like Uber, Lyft and Sidecar have become popular alternatives to hailing a taxi or calling a cab company directly. Many taxi drivers are increasingly unhappy about the competition, claiming it is hurting their business, and have even organized protests. The smartphone-app based services also are running into regulatory issues. The Los Angeles Department of Transportation recently issued a cease and desist order to the three companies, citing a lack of proper permits and licenses. For now, the services are fighting to keep running and also working on expansion plans to other cities. Starting in California meant Lyft had a big pool of disco-loving, baked-goods making eccentrics, actors and Burning Man attendees willing to be drivers. Time will tell if newer cities also embrace the weird.","Ride-sharing service Lyft has attracted some outgoing drivers and kooky cars .

"(CNN) -- When Cristina Behrens travels to Santa Barbara, CA, to see clients, she likes to stay somewhere that's convenient for meetings and—almost more important—convenient to a morning jog on the beach. After trying just about every top-notch hotel in the city, the L.A.-based investment manager was surprised that her favorite—the Hotel Oceana—cost as little as $139 a night. ""My assistant booked me there for the first time about five years ago,"" Behrens says. ""I have not stayed anywhere else since."" In most beach destinations, hotel rates rise exponentially the closer you get to the shore. But it's a mistake to assume that any place on the water will carry four-star prices -- or high-end accommodations.

SeaCrest OceanFront Hotel, Pismo Beach, CA . When the SeaCrest Motel first opened in the early 1960s, it was the only beachfront hotel in this dune-buggy-loving town. After various additions and ownership changes over the years, the 158-room SeaCrest reemerged in 2007 with a bright, retro-mod décor as well as a free breakfast, pool, fire pits, patio couches, and a staircase down to a quiet stretch of sand. Located on the Pacific 101, it also makes an easy launching pad for exploring the wine country or visiting Hearst Castle, 50 miles away. Even in the high-season summer, rates start as low as $219. Doubles from $119; seacrestpismo.com. Hotel Oceana, Santa Barbara, CA . You don't really find hotels right on the sand in Santa Barbara, but this bougainvillea-covered boutique property is about as close as it gets: the beach is right across the street. Spread over six small buildings, the Spanish-style hotel has a shabby-chic vibe with rooms decorated in garden-like pinks, oranges, and greens and easy-open windows that let in the steady breeze. There are also lush courtyards, two outdoor pools, and complimentary beach-cruiser bicycles, and it's an easy walk or ride to the heart of downtown and the train station. Even though the lobby has a free breakfast, dinner fans may be tempted by the original (and last remaining) Sambo's—an old coffee-shop chain from the 1960s—right next door.

"(CNN) -- The debate has gone on for years. The athletes in big-time college sports bring in billions of dollars for their universities and the NCAA, but get nothing in return -- other than a scholarship that does not even cover the full cost of attending school. Until now, it has been largely a philosophical discussion among academics and sports enthusiasts. Are college athletes amateurs? Are they being exploited? Should college sports be kept ""pure""? But thanks to a decision by National Labor Relations Board last week and a class action lawsuit filed against the NCAA, the questions have moved out of the theoretical and into the courtroom. 'Amateurism is a myth': Athletes file class-action against NCAA . Labor board: Northwestern University football players can unionize . The lawsuit challenges the NCAA's rules against player compensation as an illegal agreement among universities to fix the prices paid to college athletes. The NLRB decision found that Northwestern University football players are employees of the school and are therefore entitled to unionize. Taken together, the mighty NCAA has never been more vulnerable in its tired defense of college sports as an amateur pastime, and in its depiction of college athletes as merely students who also play ball. While their objectives seem simple enough, the legal battle will be fierce, as will the inevitable appeals to the NLRB's groundbreaking ruling. For years, the NCAA and its defenders have argued the player compensation ban is necessary to preserve the amateur nature of college sports and the educational mission of the NCAA and its member universities. Once that system is broken, they claim, college sports will never be the same. Nor will the governing ideal that these players are students first, and athletes second. But we are well past the time to deflate the myth of what major college football and basketball are really all about. It is not about serving the so-called ""student-athletes."" Or fostering their educational pursuits. Or protecting them from commercial exploitation. Or safeguarding the integrity of the game. And it certainly has nothing to do with the mythical notion of amateurism. Instead, major college football and basketball is all about the money. And the money is substantial. The NCAA and its members rake in billions of dollars a year -- with nearly $1 billion of that coming just from the three-week Division I men's basketball tournament. Head coaches are paid in the millions, in some cases out-earning their NFL and NBA counterparts. In most cases, head football or basketball coaches at state schools are the highest paid public employees in a state. Even the university athletic directors, conference commissioners, bowl organizers and NCAA executives get their sizable share of the booty. Major college football and basketball is an industry where everyone profits -- everyone, except the athletes. It is no accident why. The NCAA forbids it. To put it simply, the NCAA rules prevent college athletes from being compensated in any way connected with their sport other than a limited athletic scholarship. They cannot even accept textbooks, a bag of groceries or a trip home to see their parents. Nor are they allowed to access the free market for their own promotional and marketing deals. And forget about getting advice or representation from a sports agent. It is all off-limits. No exceptions. To the NCAA and its members go all the spoils, while the players toil away, sacrificing their education and physical well-being, to fuel this multi-billion dollar corporate enterprise. In any other industry, this system would have been condemned long ago as a per se illegal price-fixing conspiracy (not to mention a blatant violation of the most basic labor laws). The NCAA and its members, however, have for years successfully hidden behind the Orwellian concept of ""amateurism"" as a legal and economic justification for this scheme. The time when major college football and basketball were ever truly considered ""amateur"" sports has long since passed. What remains is a wide-ranging conspiracy to maintain and solidify the very exploitation the NCAA and its members profess they are guarding against. If protecting the college athlete from commercialization were really the NCAA's concern, it would restrict or eliminate this commercialization in the first place. No corporate branding on uniforms, stadiums and arenas. No corporate sponsorships of bowl games and tournaments. No mass merchandizing of player jerseys and apparel. No 10-figure television deals. And no scheduling of game times to accommodate prime time ratings (without regard to academic schedules). Instead, the NCAA and its members feed the corporate frenzy and keep all the proceeds for themselves. The NCAA could also employ a number of softer alternatives to its blanket ban on player compensation. It could create a revenue share ""lock box"" which athletes could draw upon for educational or career development pursuits. It could follow the Olympic model of amateurism and allow athletes open access to the commercial free market for endorsement and promotional deals. And it could make available a slew of benefits and subsidies to better protect the health and educational well-being of the players. In not adopting these alternatives, the NCAA and its members have made it clear that either they have no real concerns about amateurism, or they have no real concern for the well-being of their big-time athletes. To be sure, the two-pronged assault on the NCAA remains very much an uphill battle. There have been numerous legal challenges to the NCAA ban on player compensation and virtually all of them have failed. The courts just don't seem willing to upset the archaic model of amateur college sports, an ideal even the Supreme Court has recognized as worthy of protection. But this class-action case is unique in its ""full-monty"" attack on the system and the undeniable fact that whatever big-time college sports once was, it can no longer be described honestly as any kind of amateur pursuit. The NLRB ruling is likewise firmly grounded in this reality of what major college sports has become. Whatever ultimately happens on this new legal front, this twin-challenge to the NCAA should serve as a much needed wake-up call. One way or another, this supposed guardian of the student-athlete needs to do a much better job of serving and protecting those within its ultimate charge.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Jackson died while preparing to set a world record for the most successful concert run, but he unknowingly set another record that led to his death. Jackson may be the only human ever to go two months without REM -- rapid eye movement -- sleep, which is vital to keep the brain and body alive. The 60 nights of propofol infusions Dr. Conrad Murray said he gave Jackson to treat his insomnia is something a sleep expert says no one had ever undergone. ""The symptoms that Mr. Jackson was exhibiting were consistent with what someone might expect to see of someone suffering from total sleep deprivation over a chronic period,"" Dr. Charles Czeisler, a Harvard Medical School sleep expert, testified Friday at the wrongful-death trial of concert promoter AEG LIve. The symptoms documented by e-mails among show producers and testimony from his chef, hairstylist and choreographers included his inability to do standard dances or remember words to songs he sang for decades, paranoia, talking to himself and hearing voices, and severe weight loss, Czeisler said. ""I believe that that constellation of symptoms was more probably than not induced by total sleep deprivation over a chronic period,"" he testified. Propofol disrupts the normal sleep cycle and offers no REM sleep, yet it leaves a patient feeling refreshed as if they had experienced genuine sleep, according to Czeisler. If the singer had not died on June 25, 2009, of an overdose of the surgical anesthetic, the lack of REM sleep may have taken his life within days anyway, according Czeisler's testimony Friday. Lab rats die after five weeks of getting no REM sleep, he said. It was never tried on a human until Murray gave Jackson nightly propofol infusions for two months. Translating that to a human, Czeisler estimated, Jackson would have died before his 80th day of propofol infusions. Murray told police he had given it to him for 60 nights before trying to wean him off it on June 22, 2009 -- three days before his death. Czeisler -- who serves as a sleep consultant to NASA, the CIA and the Rolling Stones -- testified Thursday that the ""drug-induced coma"" induced by propofol leaves a patient with the same refreshed feeling of a good sleep but without the benefits that genuine sleep delivers in repairing brain cells and the body. ""It would be like eating some sort of cellulose pellets instead of dinner,"" he said. ""Your stomach would be full, and you would not be hungry, but it would be zero calories and not fulfill any of your nutrition needs."" Depriving someone of REM sleep for a long period of time makes them paranoid, anxiety-filled, depressed, unable to learn, distracted and sloppy, Czeisler testified. They lose their balance and appetite while their physical reflexes get 10 times slower and their emotional responses 10 times stronger, he said. Those symptoms are strikingly similar to descriptions of Jackson in his last weeks, as described in e-mails from show producers and testimony by witnesses in the trial. Jackson's mother and children are suing AEG Live, contending that the company is liable in his death because it hired, retained or supervised Murray, who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter. They argue that the promoter pressured Murray to get Jackson to rehearsals while failing to get Jackson help despite numerous red flags warning that he was in trouble. Paris, Prince Jackson testimonies shown in Jackson death trial . AEG Live lawyers contend that it was Jackson who chose, hired and supervised Murray, and their executives had no way of knowing about the dangerous propofol treatments administered in the privacy of Jackson's rented mansion. A very long question . Czeisler was back on the witness stand Friday to answer a question that was asked just as court ended Thursday. Jackson lawyer Michael Koskoff asked his expert what may also be a record-breaker in a trial: a 15-minute-long hypothetical question. He was asked to render an opinion based on a long list of circumstances presented so far in the trial about Jackson's condition and behavior, including: . • That Murray administered propofol to Jackson 60 consecutive nights before June 22, 2009. • That Murray began to wean Jackson from propofol on June 22, 2009, and gave him none of the drug on June 23. • That a paramedic who tried to revive him the day he died initially assumed he was a hospice patient. • That show producers reported Jackson became progressively thinner and paranoid and was talking to himself in his final weeks. • That the production manager warned that Jackson had deteriorated over eight weeks, was ""a basket case"" who he feared might hurt himself on stage and could not do the multiple 360-degree spins that he was known for. • That show director Kenny Ortega wrote that Jackson was having trouble ""grasping the work"" at rehearsals and needed psychiatric help. • That Jackson needed a teleprompter to remember the words to songs he had sung many times before over several decades. • That show workers reported the singer was talking to himself and repeatedly saying that ""God is talking to me."" • That Jackson was suffering severe chills on a summer day in Los Angeles and his skin was cold as ice to the touch. Lawsuit evidence: Michael Jackson lost dance moves in last days . Jackson lawyers revised the question Friday morning after AEG Live lawyers objected to the information about Murray's nightly propofol treatments, since it was derived only from the doctor's statement to police after Jackson's death. The judge previously ruled that statement inadmissible. Instead, they brought up evidence that Murray ordered more than four gallons of propofol between April and June, which Czeisler said equaled 155,000 milliliters of the drug. An anesthesiologist uses between 20 and 30 milliliters to induce a coma for surgery, he said. The expert testified that his review of Jackson's medical records convinced him that the singer suffered a chronic sleep disorder that ""was greatly exaggerated"" while he was on tour or preparing for a tour. Jackson died just two weeks before he would have traveled to London for the premiere of his ""This Is It"" comeback concerts, produced and promoted by AEG Live. A lecture on sleep . Jurors appeared quite interested as Czeisler lectured them Thursday on his sleep research, including an explanation of circadian rhythm: the internal clock in the brain that controls the timing of when we sleep and wake and the timing of the release of hormones . ""That's why we sleep at night and are awake in the day,"" he said. Your brain needs sleep to repair and maintain its neurons every night, he said. Blood cells cycle out every few weeks, but brain cells are for a lifetime, he said. ""Like a computer, the brain has to go offline to maintain cells that we keep for life, since we don't make more,"" he said. ""Sleep is the repair and maintenance of the brain cells."" CNN Health: Sleep . An adult should get seven to eight hours of sleep each night to allow for enough sleep cycles, he said. You ""prune out"" unimportant neuron connections and consolidate important ones during your ""slow-eyed sleep"" each night, he said. Those connections -- which is the information you have acquired during the day -- are consolidated by the REM sleep cycle. Your eyes actually dart back and forth rapidly during REM sleep. ""In REM, we are integrating the memories that we have stored during slow-eyed sleep, integrating memories with previous life experiences,"" he said. ""We are able to make sense of things that we may not have understood while awake."" Learning and memory happen when you are asleep, he said. A laboratory mouse rehearses a path through a maze to get to a piece of cheese while asleep. The area of a basketball player's brain that is used to shoot a ball will have much greater slow-eyed sleep period since there is more for it to store, he said. Players shoot better after sleep. The Portland Trailblazers consulted with him after they lost a series of East Coast basketball games, he said. He was able to give their players strategies for being sharper when traveling across time zones. He's worked with the Rolling Stones on their sleep problems, he said. Musicians are vulnerable since they are often traveling across time zones and usually ""all keyed up"" to perform at night, he said. Czeisler developed a program for NASA to help astronauts deal with sleep issues in orbit, where they have a sunrise and sunset every 90 minutes. Other clients include major industries that are concerned about night shift workers falling asleep on the job, the CIA, the Secret Service and the U.S. Air Force, he said. Jackson lawyers argue that AEG Live should have consulted a sleep expert like Czeisler for Jackson instead of hiring Murray -- a cardiologist -- for $150,000 to treat the artist. The trial ends its eighth week in a Los Angeles courtroom Friday. Lawyers estimate that the case will conclude in early August.","NEW: Expert says Jackson could've died within days even without overdose .

"Richmond, Virginia (CNN) -- A historical society in Virginia, where slavery began in the American colonies in 1619, has discovered the identities of 3,200 slaves from unpublished private documents, providing new information for today's descendants in a first-of-its-kind online database, society officials say. Many of the slaves had been forgotten to the world until the Virginia Historical Society received a $100,000 grant to pore over some of its 8 million unpublished manuscripts -- letters, diaries, ledgers, books and farm documents from Virginians dating to the 1600s -- and began discovering the long-lost identities of the slaves, said society president and CEO Paul Levengood. The private, nonprofit historical society, the fourth-oldest in the nation, is assembling a growing roster of slaves' names and other information, such as the slaves' occupations, locations and plantation owners' names, said Levengood. The free, public website also provides a high-resolution copy of the antique documents that identify the slave. The database, which went online last September with 1,500 names, sets itself apart from the few other existing slave databases -- which limit themselves to specific plantations or to ship manifests that list the captives by their native African names, society officials said. The ""Unknown No Longer: A Database of Virginia Slave Names"" website is the first online resource listing slaves' names across all of slaveholding Virginia, the nation's oldest state which had the largest enslaved population, numbering a half million people, at the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, society officials said. ""Most slaves were by their owners' design and eventually by law forbidden to learn how to read and write, so they didn't leave us material that so many figures in the past did,"" Levengood said. ""That's when you have to be creative."" So using a $100,000 corporate grant from Dominion, one of the nation's largest producers and transporters of energy, society researchers began examining some of its 8 million manuscripts that Virginia residents have been giving to the historical society since its founding in 1831. Those Virginia families found the old, handwritten papers in attics, basements or desk drawers, Levengood said. The society stores the documents in an archive spanning thousands of square feet, he said. The antique papers turned out to mention slaves. ""Often they appeared in the records of the owners who owned slaves as human property, which to us sounds so obscene and alien,"" said Levengood, who's also a historian. ""But these people were writing down their inventory as if you would for insurance purposes. That's the kind of things that owners did with slaves. This was the most valuable property they owned, and they wanted to make sure it was recorded. ""Often there was a human connection, and they grew up with these people, and they recorded their birth dates and deaths. It's an incredibly complicated and tragic institution that we're just beginning to understand the dimensions of,"" Levengood said. Documents citing slaves go back to the 1690s: ""That's when slavery starts to grow fast in Virginia and other English colonies,"" Levengood said. ""Sometimes it's a real detective work. You have to read between the lines: Oh, they mention Amy in a letter, and then you have to read another letter in the collection to realize that Amy is a slave and not a family member,"" Levengood said. The society Saturday held the first of four community workshops on how to use the online database at the organization's headquarters in Richmond, Virginia. While the online website is intuitive on how to use, the workshops are being held for users who need more guidance, Levengood said. Some 80 people came to Saturday's workshop, including Gale Carter, a high school history teacher who flew in from East Chicago, Indiana for the event. Carter said the original documents digitized on the site will help her uncover more of her own family's history in Virginia, as well as help her students learn about the era. ""I'm going to use this not only personally, but professionally,"" she said. ""This is terrific. It's a model and I hope the rest of the states catch up real quickly."" Amateur genealogist Crasty Johnson of Richmond said she hopes the sites will help her trace her roots back to the 1800s. ""I need to know my history,"" she said, adding the site may help her prove or disprove many of the things she's heard about her family's past. ""I wanted to really know. I wanted to be able to see and connect the dots."" When the United States banned the importation of slaves after 1807, Virginia became the largest provider in the nation's internal slave trade, Levengood said. Slavery was eventually abolished at the conclusion of the Civil War in 1865. That means many American families with slave ancestors could have roots in Virginia, Levengood said. ""Slavery in Virginia is not just a Virginia story. It reaches across all of the slave South,"" Levengood said. ""So you may not know you have Virginia ancestors, but you could."" The database features a public message board, filled with notes posted by users searching for ancestors who may have been slaves. The advanced search fields include the slave's first name or last name; gender; occupation; owner's last name; date range; and record type. One user named ""Treebranch02"" wrote last September: ""Well, I think I found the slave owner that owned my great, great, great grandfather but that is as far as I got. Nothing on my great grandfather and great grandmother who lived in Manquin, VA. This was good for me, however. Got me excited. Wonderful site."" Elsewhere in the database is a stark description of the sale of slaves and goods in a February 11, 1858, typed letter from slaveholder William Daniel Cabell of ""Benvenue"" in Nelson County, Virginia, to his wife, Elizabeth Nicholas Cabell. ""The corn we sold yesterday brought 3.15$ per barrel. We sold all the negros 43 in number at astonishingly large prices -- the whole amounting to $32016. Nearly every one of the negros were satisfied as they were bought by people in the country mostly, going ahead of the prices given by the traders,"" Cabell wrote his wife. The letter continued: ""Jane and three children brought $2795. and Mimy and three children $2505. My father gave $25. to Mr. Agee and then allowed Mr. Turner to take Mimy as he owned her husband. Old Mr. S. Turner bought Jane and children. Jane's husband exclaimed just as she was knocked out to his master ""Glory to God on high, peace and good will to men on earth"" and it seemed to pop from his very soul. Betsy brought $1400. and was bought for Miss Perking of Buckingham."" Robert Payne, who attended Saturday's workshop, said he's been researching his family for the past 15 years, but finding information about his ancestors wasn't easy. He's hoping his 12 grandchildren can benefit from his work. ""Researching black folk is difficult, so anytime you can find a new resource it's always good to investigate,"" he said. ""It's a database for the ones that are coming up. They'll be able to take it and grow from that.""

"(CNN) -- This week, the U.S. Supreme Court considers the case challenging the Obama administration health care plan's requirement that most Americans purchase a government-approved health insurance plan by 2014. The court should rule that this individual mandate is unconstitutional. To do otherwise would give Congress almost unlimited power. The federal government argues that three provisions of the Constitution -- the commerce clause, the tax clause and the ""necessary and proper"" clause -- authorize the health care mandate. The commerce clause gives Congress authority to regulate interstate commerce. Since the 1930s, Supreme Court decisions have interpreted the commerce clause broadly. But every previous case expanding the commerce power involved some sort of ""economic activity,"" such as operating a business or consuming a product. Failure to purchase health insurance is neither commerce nor an interstate activity. Indeed, it is the absence of commerce. If Congress could use that clause to regulate mere failure to buy a product on the grounds that such inaction has an economic effect, there would be no structural limits to its power. Any decision to do anything is necessarily a decision not to do something else that might have an economic effect. If I spend an hour sleeping, I thereby choose not to spend it working or shopping. As the lower court decision in this case explained, the government's position ""amounts to an argument that the mere fact of an individual's existence substantially affects interstate commerce, and therefore Congress may regulate them at every point of their life."" Read a transcript of Monday's Supreme Court arguments . Defenders of the insurance mandate claim that health care is a special case because everyone eventually uses it. But this argument relies on shifting the focus from health insurance to health care. A similar rhetorical ploy can justify any other mandate, including even the ""broccoli purchase mandate."" Not everyone eats broccoli. But everyone participates in the market for food. Similarly, a mandate requiring all Americans to purchase a car can be justified because virtually everyone participates in the transportation market. The government also claims that health care is different because producers are sometimes required to give free emergency services to the uninsured. But why is this fact constitutionally relevant? The answer seems to be that failure to buy insurance thereby has adverse economic effects on producers. Put that way, failure to buy health insurance turns out to be no different from failure to buy any other product. Any time someone fails to purchase any product, producer profits are lower than they would be otherwise. The government's tax-clause argument is similarly flawed. It asserts that the individual mandate isn't really a restriction on freedom, it's just a tax; violators are forced to pay a fine. If this logic is correct, it would justify any mandate enforced by a monetary fine, whether it be for broccoli, a car or anything else. Every lower court to have considered this constitutional issue has ruled that the mandate is not a tax but a penalty. As President Barack Obama acknowledged in 2009, ""for us to say that you've got to take a responsibility to get health insurance is absolutely not a tax increase."" Finally, the government relies on the clause that gives Congress the power to ""make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution"" other powers the Constitution grants it. The federal government argues that the insurance mandate is a ""necessary"" element of its regulation of the health care market under the commerce clause. The court has previously defined ""necessary"" broadly as anything that might be ""useful"" or ""convenient."" But even if the mandate is necessary, it is not ""proper."" The court has previously ruled that these are two separate requirements and both must be met. What makes a federal law ""proper""? At the very least, a proper law cannot depend on a rationale that gives Congress virtually unlimited power. As James Madison said: ""Whatever meaning this clause may have, none can be admitted that would give an unlimited discretion to Congress."" If the ""necessary and proper"" clause allows Congress to adopt the individual mandate, the same logic would justify almost any other mandate. Virtually every mandate has some economic effect and could be portrayed as a ""useful or convenient"" way to regulate some market. A broccoli mandate could be defended as an effort to regulate the market in food. The threat to liberty raised by this case isn't just theoretical. Many industries would be happy to lobby for laws requiring people to buy their products, and Congress has a long history of enacting special-interest legislation. In a recent decision, the Supreme Court unanimously emphasized that constitutional constraints on federal power protect state rights as well as ""the liberty of the individual."" Little will be left of that protection if the justices uphold the individual mandate. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ilya Somin.","Ilya Somin says Supreme Court should find Obama health care plan unconstitutional .
He says commerce clause argument flawed, gives huge regulatory power to Congress .
He argues tax-clause argument also a problem, saying failure to insure brings penalty, not a tax .

"(CNN) -- The case of the first toddler ever to be ""functionally cured"" of HIV could have wide-ranging effects on the global fight to end the AIDS epidemic.

The majority of these infections are in the developing world. The most common way children get HIV is through perinatal transmission -- HIV transmission from an infected mother to a child while she is pregnant, giving birth or when she breast-feeds the child. The number of infant infections in the United States has gone down some 90% since the mid-'90s, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; that's in large part because pregnant women are routinely tested. When a mother is identified as being HIV positive, her doctor is then able to administer preventive interventions that will, in most cases, keep the virus in check. In developing countries, infants born to mothers with HIV are not so lucky. There, mothers are less likely to be treated with antiretroviral drugs that would prevent transmission during pregnancy. In North Africa and the Middle East, for instance, 3% of pregnant women with HIV received antiretroviral medications, according to the U.N. report. Some 23% in West and Central Africa did. Testing is also less sophisticated in these areas. The unidentified Mississippi woman in this case had no prenatal care and was not diagnosed as HIV positive until just before she delivered the baby. That's why Dr. Hannah Gay, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, administered the drugs within 30 hours after the baby was born. Typically, a baby born to a woman with HIV would be given two drugs as a prophylactic measure. Gay said her standard is to use a three-drug regimen to treat an infection. She did this on the Mississippi infant without waiting for test results to confirm the baby was infected with HIV. Gay thinks the timing may be key, that the timing may deserve ""more emphasis than the particular drugs or number of drugs used. Timeline: AIDS moments to remember . ""We are hoping that future studies will show that very early institution of effective therapy will result in this same outcome consistently,"" she said. Doctors will try to replicate the success of her case and see if aggressive treatment right after birth can ""cure,"" or if this is an anomaly. ""We are enthusiastic about the potential of this case, but it is one case and it needs to be replicated and confirmed through future studies and clinical trials,"" said Dr. Meg Doherty, the World Health Organization's Department of HIV/AIDS coordinator of treatment and care. ""We will not be changing any of our current guidance in this case, but we will continue to watch for new information and provide updates to our prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) and early infant diagnosis guidance as necessary."" Antiretroviral medications are pricey for people in the developing world, but treating a child for a year or two with these drugs would be a lot cheaper than paying for a lifetime of treatment after infection. Why youths aren't getting tested for HIV . Persaud is optimistic. If the result of this case can be repeated, she believes this discovery could make a huge difference internationally. ""In resource-limited settings, this kind of treatment would not be a stretch. We know how to do this and we have the infrastructure in place to deliver this kind of care.""

"(CNN) -- As one of the stars of HGTV's ""Curb Appeal,"" Bill Beckwith had a solid fan base. His death Monday in a motorcycle crash in San Francisco highlighted the love many have for HGTV, which features plenty of ""real estate porn"" programming and likeable hosts who are popular among the DIY crowd. Tributes to Beckwith very quickly appeared on the show's Facebook page and Twitter after it was reported that the 38-year-old had died when his motorcycle collided with a vehicle in San Francisco's Lower Haight neighborhood. His brother, Christian Beckwith, told CNN that his brother's gig on the show was actually ""the least interesting thing"" about the HGTV host. His brother loved adventure, he said. ""He needed to chase experiences and embrace life in its raw form as often as possible,"" his brother said. ""And so that took a lot of different forms over the course of his life."" ""A real loss - so sorry for his friends and family - the show is my favorite HGTV show,"" one commenter wrote on Facebook, while another fan tweeted ""Paul Walker and NOW Bill Beckwith who's next."" With shows like ""House Hunters,"" ""Love It or List It"" and ""Curb Appeal,"" the niche network appears to appeal to everyone, from those who love to rehab on the weekends to home dwellers dreaming big when it comes to their abodes. Sometimes the participants themselves are enough to make viewers tune in. ""Yelling at the television during ""House Hunters"" has become almost a sport,"" according to a recent Huffington Post article. ""You just can't help yourself. There's couple after couple, making the same remarks, having the same debates and wearing the same casual garb from episode to episode. Yet we still watch -- because we love it."" Beckwith was a carpenter on ""Curb Appeal,"" which offers homeowners a little makeover magic in order to help their houses make a better first impression. ""The HGTV family is deeply saddened by Bill's tragic death, and we mourn his loss along with his many family and friends who will miss his creativity, adventurous spirit and general love of life,"" the show said in a statement Wednesday. Much like the Food Network, HGTV (which stands for Home and Garden TV) has made stars of its hosts and has additional properties, such as HGTV Magazine, which showcases its content. Chip Wade, host of HGTV's ""Elbow Room,"" told Atlanta Magazine during a recent interview that ""HGTV is a wholesome network"" that doesn't ""fabricate drama."" ""[The network's] bread and butter is people leaving it on all day,"" he said. ""You can't bring in much ridiculousness and maintain that type of audience."" The shows have a devoted following that hold the network to being above fabrication. In 2012 there was a slight uproar when a ""House Hunters"" participant, Bobi Jensen, said the series made her and her husband pretend that they were still seeking out homes to buy, when really, the decision had already been made. On top of that, Jensen said, some of the episode's scenes were staged and shot multiple times. The show quickly responded, explaining that ""we're making a television show, so we manage certain production and time constraints, while honoring the home buying process."" ""To maximize production time, we seek out families who are pretty far along in the process,"" a publicist for the show told Entertainment Weekly in a statement. ""Often everything moves much more quickly than we can anticipate, so we go back and revisit some of the homes that the family has already seen, and we capture their authentic reactions. Because the stakes in real estate are so high, these homeowners always find themselves RIGHT back in the moment, experiencing the same emotions and reactions to these properties."" Despite it all, Jensen told EW she ""loves HGTV."" CNN's Jane Caffrey contributed to this report.","HGTV network has devoted fans .

"(CNN) -- The family of the late Joe Paterno released a report Sunday morning that absolved the coaching great of blame in the Jerry Sandusky child sex abuse scandal and said a prior review commissioned by Penn State University was ""factually wrong, speculative and fundamentally flawed. "" Former Attorney General Dick Thornburgh put together the new report, the Paterno family said in a written statement. ""The experts determined that the conclusions of the (university) report are based on raw speculation and unsupported opinion -- not facts and evidence,"" Thornburgh said, according to the statement. Louis Freeh, who authored the university report released in July, said the family review was ""self-serving."" Read Freeh's statement . The former FBI director said Paterno and three other former university officials showed no empathy for Sandusky's victims and chose not to report his conduct to authorities. ""I stand by our conclusion that four of the most powerful people at Penn State failed to protect against a child sexual predator harming children for over a decade,"" Freeh said in a lengthy written statement. The family statement said Paterno never attempted to hide any information or impede any investigation into Sandusky's activities while using Penn State facilities. The university responded to the report, saying Freeh had been tasked with conducting an internal review to identify failures in the school's response to allegations. ""It is understandable and appreciated that people will draw their own conclusions and opinions from the facts uncovered in the Freeh report,"" Penn State said in a written statement. The school had acted on most of the 119 recommendations made in the report, the statement said. After Sandusky was arrested in November 2011, the university fired Paterno and funded a review of the scandal led by Freeh. Official: Penn State paid Paterno's estate $5.76 million after his death . Freeh's 267-page review blamed Paterno, former university President Graham Spanier, suspended Athletic Director Tim Curley and ex-Vice President Gary Schultz for allegedly taking part in a cover-up to avoid bad publicity. The family disputed that, saying the ""allegation is false"" that Paterno participated in a conspiracy. The Paterno family review also skewered the Freeh report for failing to interview key witnesses, allowing some to testify anonymously and using an incomplete string of e-mails for evidence. Most of the e-mails from that time are unavailable, the family said. Freeh's team concluded that the school's top administrators had ""empowered"" Sandusky, the former defensive coordinator for the football team, to continue his abuse. The report said the panel interviewed more than 430 witnesses. A lawyer for one of Sandusky's victims said Sunday that Paterno should have taken action after reports of Sandusky's behavior. The family's complaints about witnesses and e-mails ""do not erase the shocking and striking documents which Freeh did uncover and which form an unassailable finding made by Mr. Freeh that Joe Paterno tragically had knowledge in 1998 and again in 2001 that Jerry Sandusky was a threat, which was never dealt with properly by the former Penn State coach,"" said Thomas Kline, attorney for Victim No. 5 in the Sandusky trial. In an online letter to Penn State's current and former players, Paterno's widow, Sue, wrote on Friday: ""The Freeh report failed and if it is not challenged and corrected, nothing worthwhile will have come from these tragic events."" The family, she said, wants a full record of what happened. The university panicked after the Freeh report was released, she claimed, and Penn State's board of trustees should have challenged the report. Penn State review recasts story of football hero Paterno . She told the players that they -- and his family -- were Joe Paterno's legacy, not a report. She also criticized the Freeh report's depiction of her husband. ""When the Freeh report was released last July, I was as shocked as anyone by the findings and by Mr. Freeh's extraordinary attack on Joe's character and integrity. I did not recognize the man Mr. Freeh described,"" she said. The university's board of trustees fired Paterno after a 46-year career because, it said, his ""decision to do his minimum legal duty and not to do more to follow up constituted a failure of leadership."" In July, the NCAA imposed on Penn State some of the most severe penalties ever, including a $60 million fine. The governing body of major college sports also vacated Penn State's football wins dating back to 1998, the year when allegations that Sandusky was abusing children were first made. That penalty removed Paterno from the top of the list of Division I college football's winningest coaches. Paterno died in January 2012. Sandusky, who ran a charity for disadvantaged children after he retired in 1999, was convicted last June on 45 counts of child sex abuse. In October, the 68-year-old former coach was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison. Spanier, Curley and Schultz face charges stemming from the Sandusky scandal, including perjury, conspiracy and endangering the welfare of children. All three are awaiting court dates and have said they are innocent, according to their lawyers. Do sanctions alter history books on Penn State and Paterno's legacy?

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Los Angeles has long been a destination for artistic dreamers from Europe: Zsa Zsa Gabor moved to Hollywood from Hungary in the 1940s to act. Warsaw-born Roman Polanski moved to Southern California in the 1960s to direct. Not to mention one ambitious actor named Arnold Schwarzenegger, who arguably has done more to boost California's image as a place receptive to Europeans than any tourism initiative the state might have dreamed up the past 30 years. But for accented aspiring pop stars from the EU and beyond, L.A. hasn't generally been considered the place to launch an international music career. That honor fell to cities such as London and New York. Until now. These days Manhattan is getting the flyover treatment as singers from all over Europe and farther east set their sights on the U.S. market via Hollywood as the new must-conquer gateway to American ears and eyes. Artists such as Estonia's Kerli, Italy's Marco Bosco, t.A.T.u.'s Lena Katina from Russia, Slovakia's TWiiNS and Austria's Fawni are suddenly swarming L.A. with dreams of making it big. Their presence is being felt at small clubs such as the Troubadour (Katina played a solo show at the venue last year) to red carpets (Fawni is now well known to Hollywood event photographers) to purchased billboards on Sunset Boulevard (Bosco recently bought expensive outdoor media to promote himself along the busy, high visibility corridor). ""I love being here...Los Angeles is my second home now,"" says Katina, who is working on her first solo record and now splits her time between L.A. and Moscow. Katina and other singers from Russia and Europe's timing couldn't be better: America has finally started to embrace the increasing globalization of pop music on a scale beyond the occasional super group (see ABBA) or German one-hit wonder (see Nena's ""99 Luftballoons"") thanks largely to Websites such as YouTube, which has leveled the playing field and cut out past gatekeepers such as MTV. Swedish singer Robyn topped many critical lists in 2010, with Denmark's Medina set to make similar inroads in the United States this year with early adopters in the pop and dance music arenas. But perhaps the most interesting singer ready to make the crossover in 2011 is Estonia's Kerli. ""When I first got here, someone told me 'there are no friends in the music business' and I was so hurt,"" the former winner of a Baltic version of ""American Idol"" said over coffee at a West Hollywood restaurant last month. ""But Los Angeles is an amazing place to live once you find the people that inspire you, and I've found that circle of friends here,"" the singer said. ""We make art together, and we constantly feed off each other."" The blonde beauty who looks like a glammed-out Goth version of Lady Gaga (though she and her fans loathe the comparison) and sounds like a hybrid of Bjork, Brandy and Avril Lavigne moved to L.A. around four years ago and has been slowly winning over American fans ever since. Her debut for Island Records, 2008's ""Love Is Dead,"" did fairly well for a new artist, considering Kerli is pushing a sound she herself calls ""Bubblegoth."" According to Nielsen SoundScan, around 65,000 copies were sold. However, both the singer and her label are thinking bigger this year after buzz surrounding her just-released ""Army Of Love"" began heating up the internet. It's too soon to tell if mainstream pop radio stations will embrace Kerli in 2011 (her follow-up full length record is expected to see a release by summer), but there are encouraging signs. AOL's popular Popeater blog featured the singer late last year in a campaign worthy of a former ""American Idol"" star; rolling out her video for the released-in-December ""Army Of Love"" with video diaries building up to a December 22 premiere. ""It's like Euro trash meets angels singing in a choir,"" Kerli said of ""Army Of Love,"" which continues to draw interest online because of the video, which has a curious mix of swirling melodies set against striking visuals (the clip was shot in Estonia). Adventurous college radio listeners have long been boosters of acts from the Baltic states and other European countries, but mainstream pop fans rarely hear singers such as Kerli on the U.S. pop charts. And while European artists who have ""made it"" overseas have been buying second homes in the Hollywood Hills for decades, more interesting are the new pop singers living nearby, such as Slovakia's TWiiNS, who are hoping against odds to make a name for themselves in America after a modicum of success elsewhere. The duo, who are identical twins, moved to L.A. last year. They are currently working on their first record for L.A.-based indie label B Records with known U.S. producers including Bryan Todd, who has worked with names such as Jordin Sparks. ""We love Los Angeles because of the weather, nice people and shopping, but the main reason why we moved is our work,"" Veronika Nízlové said via email last month. Her twin sister Daniela added the transition has not been easy. ""It's really hard to come from Eastern Europe and try to achieve success in America. We are not native speakers, we are not Americans...it's a little disadvantage to us, but our big advantage is that we are twins. "" TWiiNS, which scored a minor European hit last year with a remake of Sabrina Salerno's 1980s hit ""Boys,"" seem already savvy to the city's sometimes cruel undercurrent. In their forthcoming single ""Welcome to Hollywood,"" the pair warn other aspiring singers that not everything is sunshine and smiles in the City of Angels. ""The song is not about the perfect Hollywood,"" Veronika said, ""It's about people with their 'friendly faces' which is far from being true. You should have open eyes and be careful whom you trust. Hollywood and all that goes along with it really has two sides to it."" Sage advice from Los Angeles' latest émigrés, who sing on their soon-to-be released single: ""Welcome to Hollywood/Boy you better give it up before it gets you down/Welcome to Hollywood/Just got to get a grip of how to get around.""","Pop stars from all over Europe are setting their sights on the U.S. market .

"(CNN) -- All Katherine McMillan wanted in a shoe was style and comfort without the frilly bows or flowers. She's a working mother who tends to buy men's shirts in small sizes and prefers the kinds of casual shoes made for men -- desert boots, moccasins, chukkas. She'll take a pair of shoes or a jacket in olive green or navy blue over lavender or aqua any day. ""I think a lot of my friends would agree that we don't want to look like an Easter egg when we go out,"" said McMillan, who lives in Minneapolis, Minnesota. ""I'm all for feeling like a girly-girl but there are ways to do it without being a French poodle."" Don't get her wrong, she likes high heels and dresses, but not in pink. So when she couldn't find a pair of shoes she liked, she decided to make her own. Hers are desert boots, moccasins and chukkas made of leather and suede with a kelly green lining to distinguish them from what the guys wear. She launched her made-to-order collection in fall 2011 under the name Mrs. P. Hicks, a nod to Pierrepont Hicks, the successful menswear accessories brand she and her husband, Mark McMillan, created in 2009. He runs the business while she is the creative force behind Pierrepont Hicks' collection of neckties, pocket squares and bow ties, which has earned a devoted cult following among menswear bloggers and the people who read them. For Mrs. P. Hicks, McMillan is designing for women who blur the line between masculine and feminine, who gravitate toward styles traditionally associated with men: flat shoes with wide lasts, unembellished blouses and button-up shirts, unstructured sweaters and blazers, jeans and pants lacking unnecessary studs, embroidery or whiskering. ""It's tomboy style, but that doesn't mean it's not feminine or sexy,"" McMillan said. ""I think you feel sexy and stylish when you're wearing something you're comfortable in."" These looks have always been around, cycling in and out with the seasons, but the latest signs show they're more than just a momentary fad. Women are looking for shoes, shirts, even neckties that fit them better than their boyfriend's clothes. Also, brands are popping up to meet those demands, from the artisanal approach of Mrs. P. Hicks to mass-market retailers like Madewell and J. Crew, which have been widely credited with giving ""tomboy"" fashion broad appeal. It's easy to forget the time before J. Crew or ""boyfriend shirts,"" times when ""nice girls"" didn't leave home in pants. Katharine Hepburn and Diane Keaton were trailblazers, female fashion icons whose neckties and pants drew stares. Modern style mavens Alexa Chung and Jenna Lyons show ""tomboy chic"" is more than a passing fashion, said Lizzie Garrett Mettler, creator of the popular ""Tomboy Style"" blog. Just as modern American women have won the right to vote and compete for the same jobs as men, it's nothing special for them to dress up in jeans or don a blazer. A tomboy is more than a girl in boy's clothing, Mettler says in her blog; it's someone with an ""inherent sense of confidence, rebelliousness and adventure."" It's part style, part substance. As brands continue to adapt traditionally masculine styles for the female form, ""the new statement on tomboy style is that it's here to stay,"" said Mettler, author of the 2012 book ""Tomboy Style: Beyond the Boundaries of Fashion."" Designer Sadie Beaudet was also drawn to menswear, but she didn't like the boxy fit on her body. She also didn't like how women's fashion was pulled from the racks one season and tossed a few months later, while menswear often had a timeless quality that never fell out of season. With her fiance, she started Tradlands, a line of tailored women's shirts that incorporate masculine features, she said. It's a small collection of eight button-up shirts with a higher collar that doesn't necessarily lend itself to an exposed collarbone; the shirts have side gusset detail typically found in the workwear of the 1940s for reinforcement and brass snaps. All of their shirts are made in San Francisco, using denim and cotton sourced from the United States. ""We're trying to walk that line with a dash of feminism in the fit but clearly masculine in the details,"" she said. Even the necktie is getting a feminine overhaul. What makes a lady tie? The fabric and the width, naturally, said Nashville designer Otis James. His hand-stitched ties have earned him nods from publications like GQ and Garden and Gun. When the 29-year-old designer realized that many of his customers were women buying for their significant others, he decided to start creating products they might want for themselves. ""I'm hoping maybe they'll bring in more single women,"" James said, mostly joking, in an interview in his Marathon Village studio last month. ""I think there's definitely a market for them."" Not everybody is comfortable with the word ""tomboy."" Some say the spirit of progressiveness has rendered the term archaic. When Carmela Spinelli hears the word ""tomboy,"" a particular look comes to mind: Strong, independent, rebellious. But the chairwoman of the fashion and accessories design department at the Savannah College of Art and Design said the description might need an update. ""To use a term that includes the word 'boy' to describe a state of independence and free-thinking for women seems kind of backward,"" Spinelli said. ""The boundaries have changed. Women are strong and independent and have no sense of preciousness, so why would you use a term like tomboy to describe that?"" Perhaps it's because of the style's close ties to menswear. McMillan's Pierrepont Hicks is better-known, but Mrs. P. Hicks is her passion project. (Plus, she gets to keep the samples, she said.) From the start, McMillan and her husband decided to keep their products made in the United States. That wasn't hard to do with neckties and pocket square, but it proved much more difficult for women's shoes, because so few manufacturers were equipped to do what she had dreamed up. McMillan ultimately partnered with Maine-based mens' shoe maker Rancourt and Co., one of few shoemakers in the United States who specialize in classic men's styles similar to the ones she wanted. For her moccasins, she found another family-owned business in rural Minnesota. With Mrs. P. Hicks approaching the two-year mark, McMillan said she has finally hit a groove and found a market. ""We even get orders from men now,"" she said. ""They say they like the green interior.""

"(CNN) -- Two weeks ago, I flew back to Seattle from Atlanta. Immediately after stepping off the plane, I could feel it: home. The fresh air hits you like a freight train. Technology is everywhere. Hipsters ironically drink coffee. Recycling bins span as far as the eye can see -- and I hadn't even left the airport yet. Driving into Seattle is like floating through a dream: mountains to the right, glistening water to the left. Hands down, Seattle is the most gorgeous city in America (I may be slightly biased). Yes, we do get a little bit of rain -- an average of 155 days a year, if you want to get specific -- but when the sun comes out, you can see why Seattle is called the Emerald City. The scenery . First off, have you checked out our needle? At its highest point, the Space Needle reaches 605 feet. From the observation deck, you can enjoy stunning views of the mountains, Puget Sound and the Seattle skyline. Grab some fresh seafood from the SkyCity revolving restaurant while taking in the landscape. Now, Portland, we think your Mount Hood is adorable, but come on: Mount Rainier is punch-you-in-the-face awe-inspiring. This 14,000-foot volcano isn't just pretty to look at; it's also is an outdoor enthusiast's dream. In Seattle, you are just 54 miles from skiing, rock climbing, camping and hiking. For the not faint of heart, the Wonderland Trail in Mount Rainier National Park circumnavigates the mountain and takes an average of 10 to 14 days to complete. If water is your thing, Seattle is nestled between Puget Sound and Lake Union. Take a ferry ride out to one of the numerous islands scattered through the sound. Or, if you prefer, a 45-minute boat ride will land you in Tillicum Village on Blake Island, where you can dine on a traditional Native American salmon bake followed by a cultural show inspired by the Coast Salish tribes. Can you hear the music? Seattle is the birthplace of grunge. Nirvana, Pearl Jam and Soundgarden spawned an entire era of flannel shirts, unkempt facial hair and teen angst. But the music roots run deeper here. Hey Portland, have you heard of Seattle native Jimi Hendrix? If you care to pay your respects to the iconic 1960s rock star, you can take a short drive to Greenwood Memorial Park in Renton, Washington. To further educate you on music, the Experience Music Project is a must-see Seattle attraction. The eye-catching building, designed by Frank Gehry, houses numerous music exhibitions, an interactive sound lab and a state of the art concert venue. Guitar enthusiasts will particularly enjoy Guitar Gallery: The Quest for Volume. If you care to hear some live music, Bumbershoot, the yearly outdoor music festival, is guaranteed to satisfy your ears. Or, for a year-round affair, stop on by Neumos Crystal Ball Reading Room to sample some awesome punk and indie rock music. Flying fish and more . Want to see fish fly? Stop on by Pike Place Market and make sure to look out for a Copper River Salmon flying over your head. The fishmongers at the world-famous market are skilled in the art of tossing fish ordered by customers. Pike Place Market was founded in 1907 and is one of the oldest open-air, public farmers markets in the United States. But there's more to this market than just the amazing, locally grown food. Wonderful restaurants, unique shops, the Seattle Aquarium and eccentric buskers really make the trip down to Elliott Bay worth your while. And if you're wiped out from all that shopping, walk across the street to the original Starbucks to grab some java. Speaking of coffee, did I mention that Juan Valdez has a time share here? You can't swing a laptop in this town without hitting a coffee stand that features tons of flavors, roasts and a plethora of options for the caffeine junkie. Sorry Portland, but as much as we love our sister to the south, the fact is that Seattle has everything we could want and more.

"Washington (CNN) -- Bruce Morton, a longtime CNN national correspondent, passed away Thursday at his Washington home at the age of 83. Morton's broadcast career stretched across 40 years, first at CBS, where he hosted the ""CBS Morning News"" among other things, then at CNN, where he was chief national correspondent before retiring in 2006. After his last report for CNN, anchor Wolf Blitzer paid tribute to Morton by saying, ""One of our colleagues likes to say that if there were a journalist hall of fame, Bruce Morton certainly would be in it."" Below is CNN Washington bureau chief and Senior Vice President Sam Feist's note to the bureau on Morton's passing: . ... I have sad news to report about a beloved member of the CNN family. Our long-time National Correspondent, Bruce Morton, passed away on Thursday. He was 83. All of us who worked with Bruce knew him to be a reporter's reporter; a man who cared deeply about journalism, politics and people. Bruce could tell a story like no other, as he effortlessly weaved facts, emotion and history into every one of his news stories. A story about a Senate race might be full of references to Lyndon Johnson, Richard Russell, or even Daniel Webster. Bruce understood the importance of historical context. Without exception each of his stories was unique and brilliantly written. Simply put, Bruce was a modern day news poet. Hear Morton remember the legacy of Rosa Parks . Politics was Bruce's specialty and he keenly understood that the actions of a lawmaker or a candidate could have profound consequences that might ripple across America, across the Globe. He attended virtually every political convention from 1960 through 2004. He was a CBS News correspondent from 1964-1993, and a CNN correspondent from 1993-2006. While at CBS, beyond covering campaigns, he reported on everything from Vietnam to the deaths of MLK and RFK to Watergate. At CNN, Bruce was not only our National Correspondent, but he also delivered a weekly essay ""The Last Word"" on our Sunday program, ""Late Edition."" That essay, in my opinion, was often the most brilliant two minutes on American television each week. He retired with shelves of Emmy Awards, a Polk Award, and a Peabody Award. Bruce was an original member of the famed ""Boys on the Bus,"" and could share campaign trail war stories with his colleagues and our viewers like nobody else. His daughter, Sarah Morton, told me that working and covering politics for CNN was one of Bruce's great loves. I have missed Bruce Morton's voice on our air these last few years. Now I'll miss his emails and his remarkable blog postings, which he updated often. http://brucemortonblog.blogspot.com/ . A few days ago, he wrote this about the midterm elections: . We have off-year elections this year. That means elections for the Senate -- a third of its hundred seats up for six year terms and all of the House's 435 seats, for two year terms. The District of Columbia won't vote; we have no representation in the Congress. In a lot of districts the issues will be local -- a bridge, an allegedly crooked pol. It will be harder, I think, for Republicans to make President Obama's person or policies be issues because he and they have been moderate. I can remember when public anger was so strong here -- during the Vietnam War or the Nixon impeachment -- when perfect strangers would yell on the street at those of us who covered the news. There's none of that now. It looks like a clean battle for November, followed by the big shootout two years later. When Bruce retired from CNN in 2006, Wolf Blitzer ended his Situation Room broadcast by saying, ""Bruce brings something very special to television journalism, a truly unique voice, smart and wry, with a perspective you could only get by covering politics for five decades."" ""One of our colleagues likes to say that if there were a journalist hall of fame, Bruce Morton would certainly be in it,"" Wolf said. Bruce Morton -- rest in peace dear friend.

Welcome to the madness of underwater hockey, a decades-old sport that boasts an international following -- but still draws disbelief and chuckles in the United States. ""I think most people hear (about it) and think, 'oh that's not really a sport,' and brush it off,"" said Chris Docampo of the Swordfish Underwater Hockey Club in Atlanta. ""Maybe that's why it's not heard of as much."" Far from a joke, underwater hockey combines speed, agility, strength and strategy -- several feet below the nearest oxygen supply. The underwater hockey glossary . ""This is for people who are true athletes,"" said Keith Morgan, DoCampo's teammate. At 52, Morgan is almost twice the age of Docampo. But here, age, size and gender don't matter. The water is the great equalizer. Playing under pressure . Play begins when two flipper-donning teams line up along opposite ends of a pool and race toward a puck submerged in the middle. Some splash and tear across the surface like speed demons, while others disappear immediately underwater. If you dive under right away, you might reach the puck first -- only to realize you're out of oxygen and need to come up for air. Sprinting across the surface allows you to breathe through a snorkel; but someone else will probably reach the puck first. What happens after the initial face-off can only be described as elegant chaos. The neon-finned players flip around and over each other like a sphere of tropical fish circling prey. In this bizarre, three-dimensional playing field, attackers can sneak in from above, the side and even underneath. At 3 pounds, the puck is about eight times heavier than an ice hockey puck so it can stay grounded underwater. But such density, combined with the surrounding water pressure, also makes it that much harder to push with a 12-inch stick. At the bottom, Docampo whips his body around in a tight circle to defend the puck from swarming opponents. ""A lot of (technique) comes from experience -- asking people, 'How did you do that?' And a lot of it is muscle memory,"" Docampo said. Moments later, as two opponents battle for the puck midwater, Nikita Gokhale zips across the pool floor like a caffeinated eel and steals the puck from underneath the players. She scores a goal as stunned defenders watch behind goggles. Silent strategy . Unlike in other team sports, players can't hear what their teammates might say. The deep sounds of swooshing water drown everything out. ""I guess there is no way to communicate in the water. You just develop an intuition of what to do when,"" said Andrei Savu, co-founder of the Swordfish Underwater Hockey team. That intuition is particularly important because no single player can swim to the bottom and wage battle without needing to come up for air -- and needing an astute teammate to take over the play. ""A big part of the strategy is to determine when to go down, and when to come up,"" Savu said. ""Anticipation is key, especially with the lack of oxygen."" In just a few months, he and Docampo have already established a silent rapport. ""I know how long Andrei can hold his breath for, and I know when he's going up, so I have to go down,"" Docampo said. ""I have an idea of when my teammates are going to be running out of breath."" That makes it pretty hard to check someone against a pool wall. But that doesn't mean the sport is void of incidental contact. Docampo said he's suffered plenty of bruises. ""You get kicked underwater, sometimes you get hit by the puck,"" he said. ""We have mouth guards on the snorkels so if you take a puck in the mouth, you don't hurt yourself."" But Gokhale said the playing environment mitigates any pain. ""Because you're underwater, the impact of getting hit is almost dulled down."" Underwater, but still underground . Despite its relatively low profile in the United States, the sport started almost 50 years ago as a way to keep a British sea-diving club together during the frigid winter months. ""The whole club could disintegrate if the members were only able to plod up and down a swimming pool for six months,"" founder Alan Blake wrote. ""I had to put something together to keep the branch up to strength for next summer."" His desperation spawned octopush, a game with eight players pushing a lead disc underwater. The sport later became known as underwater hockey. It's now a fiercely competitive sport in countries such as Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, the Netherlands and Canada. Later this month, elite players from 19 countries -- including the United States -- will compete at the Underwater Hockey World Championship in Hungary. Despite its international popularity, underwater hockey has yet to rise to the surface of mainstream sports in the United States -- perhaps because it can't draw thousands of spectators like football or basketball. ""Underwater hockey is not a great spectator sport. You cannot see the game from above water, and good underwater video coverage is difficult,"" said Jen Gall, a board member with USA Underwater Hockey. And, unfortunately, ""the game cannot be 'picked up' on the corner lot."" But it's gaining popularity in places like San Francisco, which has a YMCA program and two city youth programs, Gall said. Roger Bacon High School in Cincinnati, Ohio, has one of the few -- if not only -- high school underwater hockey teams in the country. Nationwide, roughly 1,000 players participate in about 50 clubs, all of which are co-ed, Gall said. It took awhile for Savu and Nicole Mazouchova to get the sport going in Atlanta. Exactly two players showed up to the Swordfish team's first practice: the two founders. Now their club has a roster of dozens, including Morgan, a grandfather who won a gold medal in his division during the national championships in Washington last year. At 52, he wasn't even close to being the oldest competitor on his championship team. That player was 76. Now Morgan is bent on becoming the oldest championship player in underwater hockey, which means playing for at least another 24 years. ""Somebody's got to take that record away from him,"" he said. In the meantime, he serves as an unofficial ambassador for the sport whenever people ask about his team T-shirt or the bright fins he carries around. He said the reactions run the gamut -- from ""'Oh you're kidding me, that's not a real sport,' to 'Oh, that sounds way cool -- I want to try that!'"" Best places to swim with sharks .

"(CNN) -- On Sunday, there was a rally in London to protest something I never thought would need protesting in modern Britain: the rise of anti-Semitism. The rally was in reaction to a series of strange, unsettling incidents that took place during the recent demonstrations against Israeli military actions in Gaza. In one case, the manager of a supermarket in London decided to take all the kosher food off the shelves. He apparently feared that demonstrators outside might trash the shop; one member of the staff reportedly said, ""We support free Gaza."" The supermarket chain called it ""an isolated decision ... in a very challenging situation."" Isolated it may have been, but it is part of a bigger picture. There have always been people in the West who disagree with aspects of Israeli foreign policy and there has always been a peace movement ready to protest Israel's actions. But what has made the 2014 protests different is the growing conflation of Israel in particular with Jews in general. Not all kosher food comes from Israel, not all Jews who eat it agree with the assault on Gaza. Yet such an important distinction between state and racial identity has begun to erode. The result: a return of low-level anti-Semitism to public life. Of course, some of it has never gone away. Just two years after the end of the Second World War, there were anti-Semitic riots across Britain. Europe has an insidious history of Holocaust denial, and even a multicultural haven like New York has seen racial tensions flare. But in 2014, anti-Semitism went global all at once. In July, an anti-Israeli demonstration in Paris broke into racist rioting: Jewish-owned shops and synagogues were targeted. In Berlin, they were chanting: ""Jew, Jew, cowardly pig, come out and fight alone."" In New York, just last week, a Jewish couple were roughed up by thugs waving Palestinian flags, according to the New York Post. In my native Britain, anti-Semitic attacks have risen and we've seen the return of old prejudices on anti-war marches. It's important to stress that these are -- like the kosher food disappearance -- ""isolated"" incidents that do not indict everyone in the peace movement. But they are making Jewish communities which once felt safe suddenly feel threatened. Emigration to Israel by French Jews jumped 70% in 2013 and will likely be even higher this year. At the beginning of the Gaza operation, Times columnist Hugo Rifkind wrote in The Spectator that he was uncomfortable with Israel's policies. One month later, after the protests, he wrote in The Times that he felt ""uncomfortable to be a Jew."" There is a creeping sense of sickness in all of this. Like a virus that starts with an itch in the back of your throat -- that you suspect could be something dormant about to break through. Part of the reason is genuine, understandable anger at what has happened in Gaza. But while that might explain fury at the Israeli state, it does not explain attacks on Jews overseas. After all, a state does not speak for all its citizens, let alone its ethnic diaspora. In Die Welt newspaper, one Jewish German wrote, ""Jewish students get anti-Zionist hate mail when Israel responds to rocket attacks by Hamas. The loudest part of supporters of Palestine has lost all sense and gives all the guilt to anyone who wears a skullcap or a Star of David."" He added: ""For Jews, the danger comes not long only from the right."" That is a big part of the problem. Anti-Semitism has historically been associated with the far right, parties of which have capitalized upon the Credit Crunch and done well in recent European elections. The recession has drawn some back into narrow-minded nationalism, and even the blood and soil politics of the 1930s. The most striking examples of this are the virulently racist Jobbik movement in Hungary or the more subtly racist Front National in France. But anti-Semitism has also been allowed, even invited, to enter the left, too. The peace movement has been reinvigorated by Muslim immigration to Europe, and aspects of the left have made alliances with people who make spurious claims to be Muslim community leaders. In reality, those leaders do not speak for the vast, vast majority of Muslims who understand the distinction between Israeli policy and Jews. But the influence of this particular brand of Islamic extremism is being felt on the marches -- as the Parisian riots attest. At the same time, left-wing critics of Western foreign policy have often flirted with the notion that there is an unholy alliance of America and Israel making all the decisions. Or even that Israel is in fact directing what the United States does through a conspiracy of lobbyists, capital and media. I encountered this firsthand when I did a TV debate with a leader of the Stop the War Coalition in London last week. I was told that the West was only supporting the Kurds against ISIS in northern Iraq because of American and Israeli oil interests. I laughed. I could think of no more fitting response. That experience caps several years of noticing a quiet perversion of peace movement politics taking place. On a personal note, I am anti-interventionist (borderline pacifist) and happily marched with the Stop the War Coalition against the Iraq War in 2003. But when working as a lecturer a few years later, I quit my labor union when it signed on to a boycott of Israeli academics. And I've witnessed a strange slide within the anti-war movement toward a variety of politics that leaves a bitter taste in the mouth. Obviously, I'm concerned about a rise of a socially acceptable anti-Semitism that threatens the well-being of those Jewish friends that I know and love. But I also despair that the European peace movement has allowed this situation to develop without stopping even to think about it. The tolerance that some on the left are showing toward anti-Semitism threatens to delegitimize fair and reasonable criticism of Israeli policy. They have allowed a potentially noble cause to be infiltrated by people without a shred of nobility. They need to put their house in order before it collapses down on all of us.","Tim Stanley: Anti-Semitism surfaced in the wake of the controversy over Gaza war .

At 2 a.m., most workers are asleep in their beds, blissfully unaware that their alarm clocks will sound in a few short hours. But for 41 percent of Americans this is the time of day is when they are most productive, according to a 2005 poll by the National Sleep Foundation. Some people prefer working the night shift. You can probably pick these folks out of your own office -- they're your co-workers who slouch into work, never a minute early but often several late, bleary-eyed and lackadaisical during the earlier part of the workday. Some might call it slacking, but science calls it something else completely. Severe night-owl symptoms, also known as Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder, are a condition characterized by extreme difficulty falling asleep before 2 a.m. and trouble waking early, according to the Sleep Disorder Channel. When forced to rise in time for 9-to-5 jobs, they are rarely at their most productive. Rather than struggle by working a traditional schedule, we thought we'd give you night owls another option: finding a career that fashions to your preferred schedules. If you're most productive at night, check out these jobs to fit your schedule. Some of them might surprise you. 1. Protective service workers must work around the clock to keep people and property safe. Examples of these types of positions include prison and jail security; police officers; correctional officers; fire fighters; security guards and private investigators. Training: Training varies based on your specific job title, but most protective service occupations require a high school diploma, college degree and/or on the job training. Average annual salary: Varies by position. 2. Health-care workers are on call at all hours in hospitals, nursing homes and home health care. Nurses, doctors, aides, paramedics, surgical staff, even office assistants are among some of the staff needed for 24-hour care. Most workers favor daytime hours, however, which leaves lot many opportunities open for night shifts. Plus, those who work the graveyard shift often earn more money than daytime shifts. Training: Education varies based on position. Many positions require extensive schooling, specialized certifications and prior experience. Average annual salary: Varies by position. 3. Air traffic controllers work basic 40-hour work weeks. But, since most control towers and centers operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week, controllers need to be available for the night shift. There are many types of controllers, including but not limited to airport tower controllers, terminal controllers, enroute controllers and radar controllers. Training: Completion of an FAA-approved education program and pre-employment test; obtaining a school recommendation; meeting basic qualification requirements in accordance with Federal law; and achieving a qualifying score on the FAA-authorized pre-employment test. Average annual salary: $117, 240 . 4. Computer operators work evening or night shifts and weekends because many organizations use their computers all day, every day. When the computer is running, computer operators monitor the control console and respond to operating and computer messages. Training: They typically get on-the-job training to learn the employer's equipment and routines; length of training varies with the job and the experience of the worker. Average annual salary: $34,000 but will depend on size of your organization. 5. Funeral directors are on call at all hours because they may be needed to remove remains in the middle of the night. Additionally, funeral home hours sometimes include evenings and weekends, requiring someone to be on staff. Training: State licensure; two years formal education, an apprenticeship and passing an examination. Average annual salary: $87,383 . 6. Casino dealers exist in casinos all over the world in the cities that never sleep. There's always a demand for nighttime workers at the gaming tables. Training: Each casino has its own education and training requirements, but most dealers are trained on the job. Average annual salary: $11,442, but dealers can double or even triple their wages with tips. 7. Photo journalists take pictures of newsworthy happenings and must be available to photograph events whenever they happen, whether it's in the early morning or late evening. Training: A college education with a background in journalism or photography. Average annual salary: $26,351 . 8. Taxi drivers are in demand for other night crawlers who are either out roaming cities, clubbing or perhaps even going into work (or coming home) themselves. Training: Local governments set licensing standards and requirements for taxi drivers, which may include minimum amounts of driving experience and training. Average annual salary: $25,264 . 9. Pastry chefs and bakers work late-night shifts in order to ensure items are fresh for the following day. Training: Many pastry chefs and bakers attend culinary school to receive specialized training. Average annual salary: $35,415 . 10. Clinical lab technicians who work in hospitals process test results for patients, no matter what hour of the day. Sometimes, analyzing these test results are the difference between life and death. Training: A bachelor's degree with a major in medical technology or one of the life sciences; some places hire with only a combination of education and on-the-job or specialized training.

"(CNN) -- Two years after the United States pulled its forces out of Iraq, the country is, in the words of one analyst, ""a house of cards."" ""It is a contraption held together solely by the reluctance of its many components to let things again come to blows, and which survives on constant infusions of cash thanks to high international oil prices,"" wrote International Crisis Group analyst Joost Hilterman. Yet the blows keep coming. In some parts of the country, violence has reached urgent proportions, with nearly 1,000 people killed in October alone, according to the United Nations. With Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in Washington to plead for help from the United States in battling a resurgent al Qaeda, here's a look at some of the main issues facing the country. Sectarian divisions . At the heart of so many of Iraq's many problems is the deep-seated division between the country's Shiite majority and its Sunni minority. Those divisions have deep roots, including decades of repressive and often violent policies against Sunnis -- particularly Kurdish Sunnis -- under the decades-long rule of dictator Saddam Hussein, deposed in the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. A Kurdish Sunni, Jalal Talabani, is Iraq's president. However, many members of the faith feel marginalized by the more powerful al-Maliki and what the International Crisis Group described in August as his ""divide-and-conquer strategy that has neutered any credible Sunni Arab leadership."" Despite a power-sharing agreement reached in 2010, Sunnis -- who enjoyed political dominance under Hussein -- have complained that al-Maliki has used ""de-baathification"" as a pretext to exclude them any significant role in national government. In 2010, many Sunnis boycotted parliamentary elections after a government commission banned nearly 500 candidates for alleged links to the Sunni-dominated Baath Party once led by Hussein. The violence playing out today has immediate roots in a 2012 Sunni protest movement that analysts say began peacefully but escalated into violence after the government responded with force first. Only later did the government offer what the International Crisis Group described as ""half-hearted, belated concessions"" that did more to disillusion Sunnis than placate them. Circumstances are likely to continue to worsen, warned the International Crisis Group. ""Under intensifying pressure from government forces and with dwindling faith in a political solution, many Sunni Arabs have concluded their only realistic option is a violent conflict increasingly framed in confessional terms,"" according to the group. 5 lessons of the Iraq war . A resurgent al Qaeda . In 2008, after an increase in U.S. forces in Iraq and with the aid of Sunni tribes who joined the battle against insurgents, al Qaeda in Iraq appeared to be badly beaten. But since the 2011 withdrawal of U.S. troops, the Sunni-led group known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant has staged a comeback amid Iraq's growing sectarian tensions -- as well as the conflict in neighboring Syria. Some, including Republican U.S. Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham, have criticized al-Maliki's governing approach for antagonizing Sunnis. In a letter to Obama ahead of his visit with al-Maliki, the two complained that the prime minister is part of the problem standing between Iraq and greater stability. ""By too often pursuing a sectarian and authoritarian agenda, Prime Minister Maliki and his allies are disenfranchising Sunni Iraqis, marginalizing Kurdish Iraqis, and alienating the many Shia Iraqis who have a democratic, inclusive, and pluralistic vision for their country,"" they wrote. They aren't alone. ""Many analysts say heavy-handed actions taken by the Maliki government to consolidate power in the wake of the U.S. withdrawal have alienated much of the Sunni minority and provided AQI with potent propaganda,"" Jonathan Masters and Zachary Lamb of the Council on Foreign Relations wrote this week. And the International Crisis Group argued in August that ""under intensifying pressure from government forces and with dwindling faith in a political solution, many Sunni Arabs have concluded their only realistic option is a violent conflict increasingly framed in confessional terms."" That the conflict is increasingly violent is without question. More than 6,400 civilians have died in violence in Iraq this year, the United Nations reports, 979 in October alone. And al Qaeda linked attacks have grown increasingly sophisticated and brazen. For instance, this week, attackers hit a military checkpoint west of Mosul with a suicide car bombing. Gunmen then targeted ambulances carrying victims, police said. In another example, fighters from the group carried out sophisticated, multipronged attacks on two prisons near Baghdad in July, setting hundreds of prisoners free, including high-ranking al Qaeda members, according to authorities. The situation has grown dire enough to raise the specter of a renewed civil war there, according to many analysts and even the special representative of the U.N. secretary-general in Iraq, Nickolay Mladenov. ""Today, Iraq is riven by constant and worsening violence, and the prospect of deepening sectarianism casts a dark shadow over the country. These challenges -- both developmental and security -- threaten the very fabric of Iraqi society and test the extent of the nation's social cohesion,"" he said in a speech last week in Baghdad. The history of Iraq . Syria . The situation next door in Syria, where civil war is raging, isn't helping Iraq's stability. Not only are Kurdish officials having to find ways to deal with nearly 200,000 refugees who have sought shelter in relatively peaceful northern Iraq, the conflict is increasing militancy in the region. ""The war in Syria has become a magnet that attracts sectarian extremists and terrorists from various parts of the world and gathers them in our neighborhood, with many slipping across our all-too-porous borders,"" al-Maliki wrote in a New York Times opinion piece this week. Although Iraq is technically neutral on Syria's civil war, al-Maliki is widely seen as supportive of the county's president, Bashar al-Assad, for fear of what could happen should Sunni extremists linked to al Qaeda take control there. ""The civil war in neighboring Syria has exacerbated domestic tensions,"" the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, a human rights group, recently wrote. ""Many Sunni and Shia radicals have joined armed groups fighting in Syria, while Prime Minister Maliki is seen by some Iraqis as being overly sympathetic to President Bashar al-Assad's government and its Iranian allies."" Security Issues . Given such issues to deal with, it's no wonder al-Maliki is calling on Obama to seek more assistance to help combat terrorism and other security concerns. Among other things, he's seeking military equipment and other aid to help bolster border security, combat terrorism and tackle other threats. The U.S. plans to go ahead with delivery of F-16 fighter jets to Iraq next year, and a senior U.S. official who spoke to reporters on background said this week that in addition to weapons sales, greater intelligence-sharing is also likely in the cards. ""What we don't want the Iraqis to do is just take a security-centric approach to this,"" the official said. ""What that means is making sure they have information in terms of where people are located, where it's coming from, where the funding is coming from, and that's something we can do pretty effectively,"" the official continued. ""So we're trying to help them now as best we can, and that's going to be a key topic of discussion over the course of the visit."" Economic issues . Although gains have been made to restore Iraq's economy after years of war, occupation and violence, crushing poverty remains pervasive, and the economy remains fragile. Nearly 2 million Iraqis sometimes lack enough to eat, Mladenov said. Infant mortality remains high, as does illiteracy and unemployment. And the violence threatens to derail the country's oil production, which drives much of its economy. According to Iraq's Oil Ministry, exports fell to 62.1 million barrels in September, from a peak of 79 million barrels in April, when the worst of the violence began. A continued slide could threaten the government's ability to pay for increased security and economic development efforts. The oil sector provides more than 90% of government revenue and four-fifths of its foreign exchange earnings, according to the CIA.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Pentagon has ""put a proposal on the table"" for U.S. military forces to train and equip moderate Syrian opposition forces for the first time, two Obama administration officials told CNN. If approved, it would dramatically increase the role of the U.S. military in Syria's civil war and would for the first time put American troops in direct contact with opposition forces. The idea has been under consideration since the August 21 chemical weapons attack outside Damascus, which the United States says was carried out by the regime of Bashar al-Assad. There are few specifics on troops or other aspects of the military proposal, but both officials said the effort envisions training taking place in a country near Syria. ""We have any number of options under development that could expand our support to the moderate opposition, but no decision has been taken at this point,"" Joint Chiefs Chairman Martin Dempsey said when asked by reporters on Wednesday about the proposal. U.N. chemical weapons inspectors to return to Syria . Until now, any training and equipping of Syrian opposition forces has fallen under the purview of the CIA and has not directly been acknowledged by the United States government. The Obama administration has acknowledged providing logistical, humanitarian and some military assistance to rebels fighting al-Assad's forces in a civil war now in its third year. The training proposal was first floated in the days after the August attack as a means to step up U.S. support for the opposition. The proposal envisions U.S. troops training certain rebels on small arms, command and control and military tactics, according to one of the officials. Weapons however would not be directly supplied by the United States because legal authority does not exist for the Pentagon to arm the rebels. Is the U.S. back to square one on Syria? President Barack Obama, who blames al-Assad's regime for the attack and threatened a limited military strike as punishment, has vowed not to put ""boots on the ground"" inside Syria. The training idea, however, has run into trouble in recent days as the United States has focused on diplomatic efforts to turn Syria's chemical weapons over to international control, sidelining at least for now Obama's push for congressional support to take military action. Both administration officials said the timing might be too sensitive now to engage in such an initiative. Dempsey initially hinted at the plan during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing earlier this month. ""The path to the resolution of the Syrian conflict is through a developed capable moderate opposition, and we know how to do that,"" he said. Dempsey noted the focus on dealing with chemical weapons. ""I think that subsequent to that, we would probably return to have a discussion about what we might do with the moderate opposition in a more overt way,"" he said. Both administration officials declined to be identified due to the sensitive nature of the information.","Plan envisions U.S. forces training and equipping only certain members of the Syrian opposition .

"(CNN) -- Imagine your doctor telling you there's nothing she can do, that your life has shifted, and you are headed to a lifetime full of painful treatments, possibly radical surgery, and even early death. That there's simply no prescription that can work. Now imagine your doctor telling you that scientists have discovered a breakthrough, one that just might brighten the life you thought was headed into shadows, one that just might save your life. This narrative, or one like it, is unfolding right now for the 3 million Americans -- and 175 million people all over the world -- with hepatitis C. The progress has been stunning, with new and forthcoming treatments now curing up to 90% of patients. In a health care climate mired in relentless, negative back-and-forth, it's encouraging to see what hard work can turn into for America's patients. It's also an opportunity to learn from the recent past. In the 1980s and early 1990s, HIV/AIDS was considered a death sentence. Doctors then had the task of telling their patients that nothing could be done. That early death was, in most cases, inevitable. But for people all over the world with HIV/AIDS, the dawn of anti-retroviral medications in the mid-1990s transformed HIV/AIDS from near-certain death into a manageable chronic disease. In the United States, the AIDS-related death rate has fallen by more than 80% since then, in large part because of advances in anti-retroviral therapy. Over the past 30 years, nearly 40 medicines have been approved to treat HIV/AIDS, and we now know that many of these medicines can also help prevent transmission of the disease as well. The parallels between HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C are remarkable -- and a reason for optimism. When HIV/AIDS was still considered a death sentence, some also claimed that treatments for it would bankrupt the health care system, as critics are claiming about the hepatitis C drug.But that did not happen. One reason is that cost containment is built into the system through the medicine life cycle. In its initial phases, innovator biopharmaceutical companies produce medical advances through pioneering scientific work and massive investments, like the $500 billion invested in research and development since 2000. After that, competition enters the market and lower-cost generics become available, helping achieve long-term savings. 2013: FDA approves breakthrough drug for treatment of hepatitis C . As a result of market dynamics and generic drug usage, the cost of medicines overall has grown more slowly in recent years than other health care costs, and makes up just 10% to 12% of total health care spending.The same can happen with treatments for hepatitis C, whose value becomes even more apparent when considering the cost consequences of not acting. Although critics say the price of a promising new hepatitis C drug raises the cost of insurance, research from Milliman in 2009 projected that, without a cure for hepatitis C, annual U.S. medical costs associated with the disease will nearly triple over 20 years -- from $30 billion to $85 billion -- indicating that curing the disease can help reduce future medical costs. Opinion: We all pay for $1,000 a pill drug . And recent projections show that the cost of curing hepatitis C patients will be far less than some have claimed. PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates that new medicines for hepatitis C will increase health care costs by just half a percent in 2014 and will level off after 2016 as patients are cured. This is particularly noteworthy given that public discussions have focused almost exclusively on the price of new medicines while ignoring the tremendous societal benefits, including the potential to prevent even more expensive health care interventions such as liver transplant surgeries and related hospitalizations. The finest biopharmaceutical research in the world helped wrestle HIV/AIDS down into a manageable disease. Now, it is giving us the same opportunity against hepatitis C -- and many more diseases.e need to move forward, and let the harrowing experience of HIV/AIDS patients inform our continued war against diseases like hepatitis C. And simple economics will remind us that, while investments at first may seem challenging, the prescription drug life cycle, market forces and tenacious global competition can lead to lower prices and broad access over time. behalf of America's hepatitis C patients, let's repeat that success once more.","John Castellani: New drugs give hope to 3 million Americans with hepatitis C .

Not that this has been the best summer for cinema. Summer movies 2014: 5 things we learned . Forbes says that as of the last week of August, summer ticket sales were down by 15% in comparison with 2013. Forbes reports that ""Nine films have topped $200 million on domestic charts so far this year, only seven of which were summer releases. ""With four months left in the year, if 2014 plays out about even with the last two years, then we should see a final domestic tally that's down by between $200-300 million, or around perhaps a 2-3% decline from last year's box office,"" Mark Hughes writes for Forbes. ""Notice, that number looks much less severe than the 25% figure for the summer, but then again that would also assume the next several months compare positively to the same period in 2013 and 2012.""

"(CNN) -- Two young men, a bunch of subordinates, one master plan: Take over the drug trade at some of Pennsylvania's best schools. Authorities announced Tuesday that they were able to foil this ambitious effort -- unearthing marijuana, hash oil, cocaine, ecstasy (or MDMA, its active ingredient) as well as cash and several weapons -- and arrest the pair allegedly at the center of it, among others. ""They were in business to make money, and they were going to do whatever they needed to do to make sure that no one threatened their business,"" Montgomery County District Attorney Risa Vetri Ferman said. She was speaking primarily of the main suspects, 25-year-old Neil Scott and 18-year-old Timothy Brooks, behind what they allegedly called the ""Main Line Take-Over Project"" -- the Main Line referring to a group of affluent towns and cities outside Philadelphia. Officials claim Scott helmed the operation, including shipping large amounts of marijuana from California to Pennsylvania, while Brooks supervised sub-dealers at area high schools. And these weren't just any schools. They include the prestigious Haverford School, from which both Scott and Brooks graduated. They had ties to its lacrosse program. The public high schools of Conestoga, Radnor, Harriton and Lower Merion -- each of which have some of the highest SAT scores in Pennsylvania -- were also part of the ring, according to the district attorney's office. So, too, were nearby Gettysburg, Haverford and Lafayette Colleges. In brief comments Tuesday, Scott's lawyer Tom Egan said his client's ""main concern ... is how the mandatory minimums are going to operate if he's indeed guilty of the offenses."" Greg Pagano, Brooks' attorney, spoke more extensively regarding his client, who went to the University of Richmond in 2013 on a lacrosse scholarship then left after one semester. He said Brooks had gotten injured, after which he was at home, ""idle and suffering from some depression"" when he got involved with Scott ""at a very susceptible, low point in his life."" ""He's willing to accept responsibility for what he did,"" Pagano said of Brooks, whom he said ""was involved in this conspiracy for a very, very short period of time."" In a news conference and release, authorities laid out what they described as an elaborate operation to build up business. This effort included things like offering incentives to sub-dealers, such as lower drug prices and being able to buy them on credit. Including Scott and Brooks, eight people have been arrested in the case, an arrest warrant is out on another, and there are petitions for two juveniles. All but two of those arrested attended local schools such as Lafayette College, the Haverford School and local public high schools. They face a host of drug, criminal conspiracy and other charges. Reflecting on the areas where this alleged drug scheme operated, Seth Williams -- the district attorney for Philadelphia, which is near the schools in question -- said in a press release, ""The days of, 'It can't happen here' are long gone."" The arrests follow an investigation that began in January. Authorities say seized text messages showed the suspects' plans to expand the business, with Scott giving Brooks business advice on how to expand marijuana sales in local high schools and Brooks encouraging sub-dealers to ""efficiently distribute drugs at their schools,"" Ferman's office said. Authorities assert the discovery of a loaded .223 caliber AR-15 assault rifle, in addition to a semi-automatic pistol and another rifle, suggest the drug ring's leaders had the capability to use force. Ferman admitted she's bothered by the fact Scott -- who left Connecticut College after three semesters of study after being sanctioned for using marijuana and creating fake IDs -- and Brooks both attended Haverford, then allegedly did what they did. ""You're dealing with kids from one of the finest institutions probably in the country,"" she said. ""To take those skills and turn it into this kind of illegal enterprise is very distressing.""

"(CNN) -- For nearly six years, hundreds of letters, most containing a suspicious white powder, were sent through the mail, addressed to President Barack Obama, members of Congress, hotels near the Super Bowl, schools, companies and others. And over that time, no one was arrested -- until Monday. That's when Hong Minh Truong, 66, of the Dallas suburb of Rowlett, was picked up by the FBI and the Postal Inspection Service. According to a law enforcement complaint filed in federal court, more than 500 hoax letters were mailed since 2008 from the North Texas area to cities across the United States and to U.S. Embassies abroad. The Justice Department said none of the letters contained any poison or toxins, but they still required an emergency response to determine whether they were harmful. Some letters did not contain any powder. The language used in the letters as well as the method for sending them indicate that Truong was responsible, authorities said. The Justice Department said the letters were sent to government offices, aerospace companies, schools, day care facilities, and hotels in the vicinity of this year's Super Bowl. Separately, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CNN the letters were also addressed to Obama and members of Congress. Texas actress who sent Obama ricin sentenced to 18 years .

"London (CNN) -- Singer Amy Winehouse has topped the British charts with a new album, more than four months after her death. The posthumous collection, ""Lioness: Hidden Treasures,"" features 12 tracks; unreleased songs and alternative versions of some of her hits. Winehouse's longtime producers Salaam Remi and Mark Ronson trawled through hours of recordings to compile the album, which also includes ""Body and Soul,"" her duet with crooner Tony Bennett. The ""Rehab"" and ""Valerie"" songstress died in July at the age of 27, following a long and well-documented battle with drink and drugs. An inquest ruled she died of alcohol poisoning, with a blood-alcohol level more than five times the drink-drive limit. Review: Winehouse's ""Lioness"" is bittersweet . Winehouse's mother Janis welcomed news of the album's success in a statement on amywinehouse.com, saying it was ""amazing news."" ""[It] just goes to show what she still means to people... I'm so proud of my daughter and so happy that she is still touching people. She's forever in my heart."" Gennaro Castaldo, spokesman for music retailer HMV, said ""Lioness"" had long been tipped as a big hit, following a massive upsurge in demand for Winehouse's music following her death. ""We fully expected it to go straight in at No.1, but to do so achieving such a level of sales is truly remarkable and shows how Amy's music continues to touch so many people,"" he said. Winehouse is the latest in a string of artists to notch up major music sales after their death: Michael Jackson, Frank Sinatra and Eva Cassidy all saw similar success. Paul Stokes, associate editor of music magazine ""Q"" said such posthumous releases were risky, but could offer new windows into an artist's talent. ""It's unlikely you'll ever know what the artist in question thought of it and whether they are happy for the public to hear it as they're not finished,"" he told CNN. ""However these records do shed often a different light on an artist's creative process so can be of merit artistically. ""And in the case where a singer has passed away suddenly, as with Amy Winehouse, they give fans an opportunity to hear the best versions of what's left behind rather than poor quality bootlegs or studio leaks.""","Amy Winehouse's posthumous album ""Lioness: Hidden Treasures"" hits No.1 .

"(CNN) -- A federal appeals court has temporarily blocked enforcement of an Arizona abortion law that opponents call one of the most restrictive in the country. A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday put the controversial parts of the law on hold while further legal challenges proceed. The San Francisco-based court also moved the case on a judicial fast-track and said it would tackle the issue as soon as possible later this year. Arizona HB 2036 places restrictions on and would criminalize most abortions performed after 20 weeks of pregnancy. The law has narrow exceptions for medical emergencies involving the pregnant woman. The law was scheduled to go into effect Thursday, and a federal judge in Phoenix earlier this week had allowed it to go into effect. That prompted an emergency request for ""injunctive relief"" to the appeals court by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Reproductive Rights, on behalf of three patients and their physicians. Those groups said in their successful emergency appeal the ban would force doctors to wait until a woman with a high-risk pregnancy was close to death or would suffer major medical damage before terminating a high-risk pregnancy. Other states permit some second-trimester and post-viability abortions, and allow for exceptions when the expectant mother's life or health would be in danger. There is no clear medical or legal standard to determine when a pregnancy would be considered ""later term."" The Arizona ban would also apply to women who have been informed the fetus would not survive after birth. ""We are relieved that the court blocked this dangerous ban and that women in Arizona will continue to be able to get safe, appropriate medical care,"" said Alexa Kolbi-Molinas with the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project. ""Abortion is a serious, personal decision that should be made by a woman, her family and her doctor -- not by politicians."" There was no immediate reaction to the court's injunction from the state's governor or the law's legislative supporters. Many Arizona state prosecutors, who would have enforced the law, were at odds on whether the law should be put on hold until its constitutionality was ultimately determined in the courts. Arizona is among 10 states to pass laws with 20-week abortion bans, according to court records. A current Arizona measure blocks the medical procedure at viability -- generally about 20-24 weeks when the fetus might be able to survive outside the womb. Gov. Jan Brewer signed the new law in April. She had supported Judge James Teilborg's decision Monday to allow the new law to proceed, saying it protects women and children. The appeals court's new order now puts that enforcement on hold. The case is Isaacson v. Thorne (12-16670).","The law would would restrict and criminalize most abortions performed after 20 weeks .

"(CNN) -- The Navy's new super stealthy destroyer, the USS Zumwalt, has a lot in common with Hollywood's starship Enterprise, according to folks who've seen it in person. Much has been written about the Zumwalt's appropriately named commander, Capt. James Kirk. But aside from that coincidence, the ship's operations center utilizes advanced technology that takes multitasking to a deadly new level on the high seas. First launched last year, this is a massive $3 billion warship -- the largest type of destroyer in the modern Navy by about 65%. One thing that sets it apart is a very small crew. Compared with about 300 sailors needed for similar warships, the Zumwalt's minimum compliment is only 130. The smaller crew is made possible by advanced automated systems which ""make it much easier and much more effective for the sailor to operate,"" says former Navy Capt. Wade Knudson, who now serves as Zumwalt program director for Pentagon contractor, Raytheon. In the operations center -- which in many ways is the heart of the ship -- sailors are surrounded by an array of video displays that have been designed to be used by a generation raised on video games, Knudson says. Raytheon tested the technology configuration in the operation center with young, gamer sailors, Knudson says. ""We've brought them down to our labs and we got direct feedback from them using human-factor engineers in order to make sure that we've integrated all the displays and information in a way that they can use the systems most effectively."" The result, he says, is less chance of making errors on the ship. ""The system and the computer provide information to the sailor in a way that they're used to."" Work stations inside the center are outfitted with three common displays, Knudson says. ""You can sit down at any of the systems and operate them."" At 610 feet long and 80 feet wide, the Zumwalt is about 100 feet longer and 20 feet wider than ships in the Navy's current fleet of Arleigh Burke-class destroyers featured in the action-packed 2012 film ""Battleship."" Although it's huge, the Navy says this thing is surprisingly stealthy. Much of the ship is built on angles that help make it 50 times harder to spot on radar than an ordinary destroyer. ""It has the radar cross-section of a fishing boat,"" Chris Johnson, a spokesman for Naval Sea Systems Command, told CNN last year. Meet Capt. James Kirk, commander of the USS Zumwalt . Sean Gallagher, of the self-described ""alpha geek"" website Ars Technica, got a chance last year to explore a mockup of the Zumwalt's operation center. The workstations are part of the ship's Common Display System -- nicknamed ""keds"" for short, Gallagher reported. Sailors operate keds with ""trackballs and specialized button panels,"" Gallagher reported. Operators have an option to interface by using touchscreens, if they prefer, according to Gallagher. The whole operations center technology array saves manpower by allowing sailors to monitor multiple weapons systems or sensors, Gallagher reported. The Zumwalt, Gallagher wrote, also includes limited wireless networking capability. ""Theoretically, the ship could even be steered from the ops centerâ€”the ship is piloted by computer, not a helmsman,"" Gallagher wrote. CDS displays are built into the ""commanding officer's and executive officer's chairs on the bridge,"" he reported. The way all the ship's weapons, radar and other systems are displayed to users and the captain, Knudson told CNN, ""it really give them unprecedented situational awareness."" ""That ability is truly going to be a game-changer."" In its current configuration, the Zumwalt will carry a considerable arsenal of weapons, including two Advanced Gun Systems (AGS), which can fire rocket-powered, computer-guided shells that can destroy targets 63 miles away. That's three times farther than ordinary destroyer guns can fire. But one day it could be fitted with advanced weapons systems that are currently experimental, including a laser weapon and an electromagnetic railgun. Electromagnetic railguns don't need to fool around with needless explosive warheads or propellants. These fearsome weapons inflict damage by sheer speed. The gun uses electromagnetic force to blast a missile 125 miles at 7.5 times the speed of sound, according to the Navy. The laser weapon -- which could be fired by one sailor on a video game-like console -- is designed to take on aircraft or small surface vessels. Read more about the Navy's plans for new weapons . Currently undergoing sea testing, Knudson says the Zumwalt is expected to join the rest of the Navy fleet sometime in 2016.","Navy's new destroyer USS Zumwalt boasts operations center bristling with new technology .

"(CNN) -- Paraguay faced increasing regional isolation on Monday after several of its neighbors said over the weekend they were pulling their ambassadors out of the country in the wake of the president's impeachment. Chile and Venezuela recalled their ambassadors Sunday, hours after Brazil and Uruguay -- two of Paraguay's most important neighbors -- did the same. Argentina recalled its ambassador on Saturday. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez also said his country is halting all shipments to Paraguay. The Brazilian Foreign Ministry said the action was because of the ""breakdown of democracy"" in Paraguay, and vowed to take up the impeachment with the regional blocs MERCOSUR and UNASUR. The moves follow the lightning-quick removal from office of the president, Fernando Lugo, on Friday. The impeachment procedures appear to have been carried out in accordance with the Paraguayan constitution, but some Latin American presidents called it a coup d'etat and refused to recognize the new president, Federico Franco. Lugo went from president to ousted leader in less than 48 hours. The former Catholic bishop was unpopular with lawmakers, and many had concerns about his credibility after he admitted to fathering at least two children while still in the priesthood. In all, four women claim they had babies by Lugo while he was a bishop. But nine days ago, there was no reason to believe that Lugo would find himself out of a job before his term ended in August 2013. There had been calls in the past for the impeachment of Lugo, but the scandals weren't enough to bring him down. That changed on June 15, when the police clashed with landless peasants in eastern Paraguay, resulting in 17 deaths. Peasants fired on police officers who were trying to evict them from private property, initiating the deadly confrontation, the local authorities and state-run media said. The violence occurred in Curuguaty, a remote community near the Brazilian border, about 240 kilometers (150 miles) northeast of the Paraguayan capital, Asuncion. In response to the violence, Lugo replaced his national police chief and interior minister. Members of the country's liberal party, which backed Lugo, were incensed to learn that the new minister was from another party. As the outcry over the deadly clash continued, the liberal party announced Thursday that it was withdrawing its support of Lugo, and an impeachment vote was heard in the lower chamber of Congress that day. The vote in favor of impeachment was 76-1. The next day, Lugo's defense team had two hours to defend Lugo from what it called vague charges of incompetence. The Senate impeached the president in a 39-4 vote. Lugo said Paraguayan history and democracy had been ""deeply wounded"" by the move. The rapidness of his ouster left neighboring countries scrambling to react. By Sunday, Brazil and Uruguay were expressing deep concerns. The Brazilian Foreign Ministry condemned the Lugo's removal and the Uruguayan president said it wasn't in line with democratic practices. The presidents of Venezuela, Argentina, Bolivia, Ecuador and the Dominican Republic said they would not recognize Franco's administration. The Mexican Foreign Ministry and Chavez of Venezuela said the speed with which Lugo was removed didn't give him time to mount a proper defense. Franco reiterated that the impeachment happened within the parameters of the constitution, and pointed to the large margins by which Lugo was voted out of office. ""It means that here we have a unanimous position,"" he said. ""The Paraguayan people, I think, are satisfied with this decision."" Despite the cold shoulder from neighboring countries, Franco said he would reach out to explain the legality of Lugo's ouster and seek good relations with other countries. He said his goal was for his presidency to be recognized internationally by the time he hands over to the next president in 2013. Most of the countries opposed to Franco's appointment belong to the Union of South American Nations, known as UNASUR. The foreign ministers of that regional body were in Paraguay to study the issue. The United States reacted in a more neutral manner. ""We urge all Paraguayans to act peacefully, with calm and responsibility, in the spirit of Paraguay's democratic principles,"" State Department spokeswoman Darla Jordan said. CNN's Marilia Brocchetto and Fernando del Rincon contributed to this report.","Chile, Venezuela, Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina recall their ambassadors .

"(CNN) -- Karen Handel, the Susan G. Komen for the Cure Foundation vice presidentâ€”and lightning rod in the group's public relations storm over Planned Parenthood funding--stepped down from her position Tuesday. For many it was almost a satisfying ending to an eye-opening incident. None of it should have come as a shock. When the Komen foundation last week bowed to pressure from anti-abortion activists to stop most of its funding of Planned Parenthood, the furor was swift and forceful. Komen's decision was frequently described in the media and in the online outcry as a ""betrayal"" â€” of its mission, of the millions of Americans who run in its Race for the Cure every year, and of the women whom Komen and Planned Parenthood serve. But to people familiar with the foundation, the decision was hardly a surprise. Under the perky pink ribbon at the center of Komen's brand lies a distinctly conservative orientation shaped over three decades by the foundation's political and corporate alliances. Despite its carefully cultivated nonpartisan image, the foundation's connections to the Republican Party are deep and longstanding. Nancy Brinker, Komen's founder, has raised thousands of dollars for the GOP over the years and was rewarded when President George W. Bush named her ambassador to Hungary in 2001. Last year's hiring of Handel, an anti-abortion Republican, to head Komen's public policy efforts was not a sudden swing to the right, as some commentators have implied. Beyond this, even a cursory glance at the group's corporate partners could help explain why so much of its funding goes to detection and treatment. In interviews, Komen executives have denied that their corporate funders exert any influence over their policy decisions. But an organization that takes money from the chemical and energy industries, fast food companies, and cosmetics manufacturers is unlikely to fund research on environmental toxins or pursue other prevention-oriented concerns. And, for the most part, Komen doesn't. Instead, the foundation focuses on early detection through mammography -- an imperfect tool -- and fundraising for treatment-oriented research, which has produced little in the way of concrete results. People with breast cancer have essentially the same options as they did half a century ago: surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. While their chances of dying from the disease have improved very slightly in recent years, breast cancer incidence rose steeply over the course of the 20th century to one in eight today. Komen is hardly the only case of a foundation held sway by political and corporate interests. Philanthropy is political; it always has been. Like public funds raised through taxation, decisions about how to spend money generated through charitable giving are controversial and subject to partisanship. We might prefer to think of charity rising above the political fray, but in reality it is an extension of it. Nor does charity escape the pressures of the market. It is common practice for large foundations to enter into partnerships with corporations, to spend large sums on marketing and public relations, and to tailor their brands to what consumers want rather than their official missions. Komen has been incredibly successful in promoting its brand of breast-cancer awareness, but not without setbacks. It has had a rough two years in this respect. Its 2010 ""Pink Buckets for the Cure"" partnership with KFC raised concern among nutritionists and other health advocates about promoting junk food in the name of breast health. A year later, a Wall Street Journal article reported that Komen devotes considerable time and money to suing small charities who use ""for the cure"" -- a Komen trademark -- in their fundraising. The small media storm had barely faded when critics began raising concerns about Komen's Promise Me perfume, which was produced in partnership with a New York company that makes a sizable donation to the foundation. The breast cancer activist group Breast Cancer Action, said a chemical study it conducted revealed that the perfume contained toxic and hazardous ingredients. The Komen foundation said it is reformulating the perfume. Then came the news about Planned Parenthood. Last week, many of Komen's most faithful supporters took the lessons they had learned from the foundation about self-empowerment and put them to work. The groundswell of concern about Komen's funding policies is testament not only to the strength of pro-choice sentiment but to the success of the foundation in building a movement of women who are prepared to advocate for their own and others' health. Herein lies the promise of this moment. By harnessing the considerable financial and social loyalty it has built over the years, the Komen Foundation has an opportunity to do much more than reverse one small, but significant funding decision; they could take the lead in constructing a radically different approach to the breast cancer epidemic. This new approach would prioritize not political interests or corporate sponsors, but women's health. Along the way, it might also bring us closer to realizing the Komen Foundation's vision of a ""world without breast cancer."" Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter . Join the conversation on Facebook .

"(CNN) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in China next week before international talks are held on Iran's nuclear program in Moscow, Russia's state-run RIA-Novosti news agency reported Sunday. The meeting is aimed at allowing Putin to ""feel the heat surrounding the Iranian problem and see how this issue is perceived in Tehran,"" Yuri Ushakov, a former U.S. ambassador who now serves as a Russian foreign policy adviser, told the news agency. Putin and Ahmadinejad will meet on the sidelines of the 12th Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, to be held June 6-7 in Beijing. The United States, France, Russia, China, Britain and Germany -- the so-called ""P5+1, a reference to Germany plus the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council -- will meet in Moscow for another round of talks on Iran's nuclear program June 18-19. ""We weren't too happy with the results of the last round of talks, but we determined the mutual readiness to continue the discussion,"" Ushakov told RIA-Novosti. At the Moscow meeting, he said, Russia will ""promote the thought that Iran's right to develop peaceful energy under the oversight of the International Atomic Energy Agency should be approved."" World powers, particularly Western nations, suspect that Iran wants to build nuclear weapons, although Tehran insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. Last month, during a round of talks with the P5+1 in Baghdad, Iran rejected calls to stop the high enrichment of uranium that can be used for weapons, while the international powers refused Tehran's demand for an immediate end to sanctions imposed by the United Nations, the United States and the European Union that are crippling its economy. Because 80% of Iran's foreign revenues are derived from oil exports, an embargo by the EU set to take effect in July will put further pressure on its economy. Russia historically has been hesitant to support sanctions on Tehran. In November, it called a new round of sanctions ""unacceptable,"" saying they hinder efforts to reach a diplomatic solution. ""Russia sees such extraterritorial measures as unacceptable and against international law,"" said a statement from the Russian Foreign Ministry, issued a day after the new sanctions were announced. ""Such a practice seriously obstructs advancement toward a constructive dialogue with Tehran. Stronger sanction pressure, which some of our partners see almost as a goal in itself, will not encourage Iran to sit down at the negotiating table."" Just after the Baghdad talks, the U.N.'s IAEA said its inspectors found a high level of enriched uranium in Iran. The nuclear watchdog agency asked Tehran to explain the presence of particles of enrichment levels up to 27% found in an analysis of environmental samples taken in February at the Fordo fuel enrichment plant near the city of Qom. The previous highest level had been 20%, typically used for hospital isotopes and research reactors. To build nuclear weapons, 90% enrichment is required. Iran said in response that the production of such particles ""above the target value"" may happen for ""technical reasons beyond the operator's control."" The IAEA said it is ""assessing Iran's explanation and has requested further details.""","The two leaders will meet next week in China, according to media reports .

"(CNN) -- European Union leaders agreed to earmark 12 more individuals for visa restrictions and asset freezes in the second stage of their four-step plan to prompt Russia to renege on its annexation of Crimea. The list, which brings the total number of those targeted to 33, puts the Union on a position closer to the United States. The U.S. also added to its tally of targets on Thursday, tightening the noose around President Vladimir Putin's inner circle. Two EU officials confirmed exclusively to CNN that the Speaker of Russia's Upper House, Valentina Matryienko, was among those set to be slapped with sanctions, as was the Deputy Prime Minister Dmirty Rogozin. Other names among the new additions included two key aides to Putin, Sergey Glazyev and Vladislav Surkov, as well as Dmitry Kisilev, a TV anchor known for his provocative views. EU members agreed unanimously on the candidacy of some the figures put forward after several hours around the negotiating table at a working dinner which ended after midnight on Thursday. But some of bloc's 28 states expressed reservations on the names put forward for fear of Russian retaliation, the aides said. Rogozin, in particular, the official said, was almost blocked by Cyprus and Slovakia, with the latter securing the right to allow him access to its country for meetings of an energy cooperation forum he chairs, one of the officials said. Malta also expressed concern about an unnamed candidate for sanctions, but withdrew its objection. CNN also understands that family members - considered key to the efficacy of any measures- were not explicitly mentioned amid questions about the legality of such a move and the viability of placing travel bans on individuals, who in some occasions are already resident inside the EU. And for those expecting swathes of Russian industry to feel the brunt of Europe's indignation, there may be disappointment. Despite the US's move to penalise Bank Rossiya, chief executives of the country's largest companies, like Gazprom, Rosneft and VTB Bank, will not feature on the EU's additional file. What's more: Mr Putin's Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov and his Minister of Defense Sergey Shoigu -- already frozen out by America -- were left off Europe's list for fear of sending a bellicose signal to Russia.

"(CNN) -- Two U.N. World Food Programme workers and a third colleague from a local agency were shot to death in Somalia Friday, the organization said. The trio was attacked in Mataban town in Hiban Province in central Somalia, United Nations spokesman Martin Nesirky said. The World Food Program said its two slain employees were Muhyedin Yarrow and Mohamed Salad. The third victim, Abdulahi Ali, worked for Doyale, one of agency's partners. The incident illustrates the risks that humanitarian workers can face working in dangerous and difficult environments, Nesirky said. The aid workers were part of a mission in the area that was monitoring food distribution and camps for internally displaced people. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called ""on authorities to ensure the safety of humanitarian workers,"" a spokesperson said. ""He expects those responsible to be swiftly brought to justice."" The alleged shooter reportedly gave himself up and was arrested, the agency said. World Food Programme operations in Mataban have been suspended while the case is investigated. ""WFP condemns the killing of people who devote their lives to helping others and extends its deepest condolences to the families of the victims,"" the agency said in a statement. Yarrow, 54, had worked for the agency for 13 years, and Salad, 28, joined the organization two years ago, it said.","NEW: The names of the victims are released .

"(CNN) -- Hours after a crushing Stanley Cup defeat at the hands of the Boston Bruins, Vancouver residents on Thursday were trying to come to terms with the reasons their city had again exploded in riots. ""It's totally unlike Vancouver,"" said Jennifer Richie, bar manager at the Wicklow Public House bar and restaurant. ""Just too many people had too much to drink."" She said fire and smoke billowed in and around adjoining neighborhoods near Rogers Arena, where hundreds of angry hockey fans rampaged after the loss. ""I'm a little ashamed to live in Vancouver right now."" The incident echoed a 1994 Vancouver riot after a Stanley Cup loss to the New York Rangers, which caused widespread damage that resulted in hundreds of arrests. Vancouver Police Chief Jim Chu is blaming ""criminals and anarchists"" who, he said, disguised themselves as Canucks fans for the riots. ""These were people who came equipped with masks, goggles and gasoline, even fire extinguishers that they would use as weapons,"" Chu said of Wednesday night's melee. Nearly 100 people were arrested, according to Deputy Mayor Raymond Louie. Fifteen vehicles were damaged after the home team lost the hockey championship to the Boston Bruins. ""We have more than 100 tips that include video and photographs of the individuals involved in the riot,"" Louie said Thursday. ""We will investigate and prosecute individuals involved in last night's activities. They do not represent Vancouver, and we thank the people that came out this morning to help clean the streets."" Among unofficial Facebook pages set up after the violence was one soliciting cleanup help and another asking readers to report riot ""morons."" One city restaurant manager called the turmoil ""disappointing."" ""I'm proud to be from Vancouver,"" said Courtney Rose, manager of the Boat House restaurant. ""I've grown up thinking we are a peaceful city in western Canada, not the kind of people who destroy property and fight with police in the streets."" Rose said she and other residents avoided downtown parts of the city after smelling tear gas in areas surrounding the arena. Public transportation was also restricted during the riot, she said, which temporarily prevented residents from entering parts of the city. The melee began after the Bruins won their first NHL championship in 39 years, trouncing the Vancouver Canucks 4-0 Wednesday night. ""It's absolutely disgraceful and shameful,"" Mayor Gregor Robertson told CNN affiliate CTV. ""It by no means represents the city of Vancouver."" He called the rioters ""despicable"" after hundreds of mostly young people took to the streets and set overturned vehicles ablaze. Some disappointed fans and rioters stopped and posed in front of the flames. Others danced atop an overturned vehicle as a cloud of gray smoke hung over downtown. Aerial footage showed city police wading into the unruly crowd that taunted and threw debris at the officers a few blocks from arena. After dropping the first two games in Vancouver, the Bruins took four of the last five games from the Canucks, who struggled to stay in Game Seven after going down 1-0 in the first period.","Facebook page asks for help in identifying instigators .

"Washington (CNN) -- The new Coffee Party movement deemed its official kickoff Saturday a ""huge success,"" with dozens of talks held at coast-to-coast coffee shops as members came together to discuss the issues most important to them. Billed by many as an answer to the conservative Tea Party movement, the Coffee Party was born on Facebook just six weeks ago. While the group has become an instant hit online -- it boasts more than 141,000 Facebook fans as of Saturday -- gauging the success of this weekend's coffee meetups was predicted to be an indicator of the group's strength. A statement released by the party said ""today's coffee houses have been a huge success -- both for Coffee Party USA and for democracy. All across the U.S., Americans from all political sides sat down for civil conversation and, of course, coffee."" At Java Monkey in Decatur, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta, coordinator Stacey Hopkins said turnout far exceeded expectations, with around 60 people participating at the ""very productive"" meeting where health care reform was the overriding issue. ""We had kids there, we had college students, high school students, and we had retirees,"" she said. ""It went across a very broad spectrum age wise and racially, and this is that we'd like to see."" Were you at a Coffee Party gathering? Share your images, story . In Asheville, North Carolina, about 35 people gathered at Filo Pastries and Coffee, according to CNN iReporter Rachael Jernigan, a stay-at-home mom who coordinated the meeting. ""I think the biggest thing to come out of it was people were tired of being labeled and divided,"" said Jernigan, who added that a Tea Party member was among the attendees. ""They do agree on a lot."" About 30 people came out to a meeting at Raleigh, North Carolina's Cup A Joe, said CNN iReporter Davis Hall. ""I really liked what the Coffee movement said the foundation was -- which is to get everybody of all stripes of life to get together,"" Hall said. The meetings were among about 350 the party planned to hold Saturday. Coffee Party founder Annabel Park, who worked as a volunteer for Barack Obama's presidential campaign and Democratic Sen. Jim Webb of Virginia's 2006 campaign, says the group is not ""aligned"" with any party and calls the two-party system out of date. Park said the bitter battle over health care is an example of how government is not working. ""We feel like the health care debate showed not only that we are a very divided country, but there's something really wrong with our political process. We kind of got to see the innards of the political process and realize there's something very broken. I think that's what we're responding to."" The party statement said the next step ""is to dig into what our community discussed (and) find out what matters most to them."" Park said the Coffee Party's first real national action will be March 27, when members will get together to discuss ways to engage members of Congress during the Easter recess. ""Just like in the American Revolution, we are looking for real representation right now. We don't feel represented by our government right now, and we don't really feel represented well by the media either,"" Park said last week on CNN's ""American Morning."" ""It's kind of a simple call to action for people to wake up and take control over their future and demand representation. And it requires people standing up and speaking up."" Sound familiar? Tea Party activists use much of the same language in describing their year-old protest movement that's steeped in fiscal conservatism and boiling-hot, anti-tax rhetoric. ""It's a response to how they are trying to change our government,"" Park told CNN, referring to the Tea Party. ""It's their methodology that we are against. We may want some of the same things, but their journey is so alienating to us."" So what does the Tea Party movement think of this new sensation? ""This Coffee Party looks like a weak attempt at satire or a manufactured response to a legitimate widespread grassroots movement,"" says Brendan Steinhauser, director of federal and state campaigns for FreedomWorks, a nonprofit conservative organization that helps train volunteer activists and has provided much of the organizational heft behind the Tea Party movement. ""It's driven from the top down and it's not a grass-roots movement driven from the bottom up,"" Jim Hoft of the St. Louis Tea Party said. CNN Deputy Political Director Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.","Coffee Party leaders held 350 to 400 events Saturday across the country .

"(CNN) -- This year is on track to be the worst for measles in more than a decade, according to new numbers released Thursday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And people who refuse to vaccinate their children are behind the increasing number of outbreaks, health officials say. There were 159 cases of measles in the United States from January 1 through August 24, according to the CDC. If that trend continues, there will be more cases in 2013 than in any year since 1996, when some 500 cases were reported. The number would also surpass that of 2011, when there were 222 cases. Measles cases in the United States numbered in the hundreds of thousands before the advent of vaccination, and dropped dramatically throughout the 1960s. The disease was thought to have been eradicated in 2000, but the numbers have recently crept back up, largely because of visitors from countries where measles is common and because of vaccine objectors within the United States. Nearly two-thirds of the reported cases happened in three outbreaks in communities where many people don't vaccinate their children for religious or philosophical reasons. ""This is very bad. This is horrible,"" said Dr. Buddy Creech, a pediatric infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University who was on a telephone briefing with the CDC Thursday morning. ""The complications of measles are not to be toyed with, and they're not altogether rare."" According to the CDC, one to three out of every 1,000 children in the United States who get measles will die from the disease, even with the best of care. Even if complications such as pneumonia and encephalitis aren't deadly, they can make children very sick; in 2011, nearly 40% of children under the age of 5 who got measles had to be treated in the hospital. Measles usually starts with a fever, which can get very high, followed by a cough, runny nose and red eyes. Soon a rash of tiny, red spots will start at the head and spread to the rest of the body. The rash can last a week and coughing can last for up to 10 days. Creech said he's concerned younger physicians might not be quick to recognize the signs of measles, since there have been only pockets of the disease since 2000. ""Many young pediatricians might not know what measles looks like,"" he said. Among those who have been stricken with measles this year, 92% were not vaccinated or had unknown vaccination status. The largest outbreak was in New York, where 58 people contracted measles in a community where many refuse to be vaccinated for religious reasons. Those who choose not to vaccinate put other people's babies at risk, since babies cannot be vaccinated until their first birthday, and are therefore vulnerable to the disease. ""I hope that those who are vaccine hesitant or vaccine avoidant realize there are consequences to their actions,"" Creech said. ""None of us lives in isolation.""

"(CNN) -- A California court hearing concluded Friday with the family of Jahi McMath -- a 13-year-old girl on a ventilator who has been declared dead by doctors -- and a hospital agreeing on a protocol for the release of the girl to another facility. The specifics of any such release -- how she'd be transferred, by and to whom, and at what time -- continue to be discussed. So while Friday's California Superior Court hearing did signal apparent progress in the hot-button case, it does not represent a final agreement. Earlier in this hearing, the judge asked attorneys for the McMath family and Children's Hospital Oakland to confer to attempt to settle the issue of what will happen with Jahi. After this hearing broke, representatives for both the family and hospital headed to federal court. There, a magistrate will oversee mandatory talks between representatives of the hospital and the family, CNN affiliate KTVU reported. Both hearings occurred on the same day that the coroner for Alameda County issued a death certificate for Jahi. This action is not directly connected to Friday's pair of legal proceedings. The coroner's office said that the death certificate -- which still needs to be accepted by the health department to become official -- has a date of death of December 12, 2013. Twenty-six days from that day could be another milestone in this ordeal: A judge has ruled that Jahi can be removed from a ventilator at 5 p.m. Tuesday. Bleeding profusely . Last month, Jahi had surgery to remove her tonsils, adenoids and extra sinus tissue. Doctors had recommended the surgery to treat pediatric obstructive sleep apnea, a condition that made her stop breathing in her sleep and caused other medical problems. Before the surgery, Jahi was worried that she would never wake up, according to her uncle. She seemed fine after the surgery and asked for a Popsicle because her throat hurt. Opinion: Let the parents decide . It wasn't long before something went terribly wrong. In the intensive care unit, the girl began bleeding profusely -- an image that her mother said would be forever seared in her mind. According to family members, Jahi went into cardiac arrest. Days later, she was declared brain dead. Hospital officials have said privacy laws prevent them from discussing details of the case. More support . The family of Terri Schiavo has joined the battle recently. ""Together with our team of experts, Terri's Network believes Jahi's case is representative of a very deep problem within the U.S. healthcare system -- particularly those issues surrounding the deaths of patients within the confines of hospital corporations, which have a vested financial interest in discontinuing life,"" the Terri Schiavo Life & Hope Network said in a statement. Schiavo was a brain-damaged woman who died in 2005 after living on a feeding tube for more than a decade. She was the subject of a lengthy legal battle between her parents and her husband, Michael Schiavo, who maintained that she wouldn't have wanted to live in a ""persistent vegetative state."" The organization said it has been overseeing the efforts of several groups to help get Jahi transferred out of Children's Hospital Oakland and brought ""to a safe place."" Jahi's family said Tuesday that it had found a facility in New York willing to take her. The Oakland hospital ""refused to agree to allow us to proceed in that matter,"" Jahi's uncle Omari Sealey said. The hospital denied the accusation. ""We have done everything to assist the family of Jahi McMath in their quest to take the deceased body of their daughter to another medical facility,"" hospital spokesman Sam Singer said. ""To date, they have been unwilling or unable to provide a physician to perform the procedures necessary, transportation, or a facility that would accept a dead person on a ventilator. Our hearts and thoughts go out to them in this tragic situation, but the statements being made by their attorney and some family members are misleading and untrue."" Family attorney Christopher Dolan had accused the hospital of being ""hell-bent"" on ending Jahi's life. In addition to the coroner, a judge has declared Jahi brain dead as well. Doctors say there's no chance she will come back to life. Sealey said Wednesday that the family still hopes to move her to another facility. He accused the hospital of starving his niece by not using a feeding tube to provide her with nutrients. Singer said a judge had dismissed the family's request for additional medical procedures Tuesday, including a feeding tube. CNN's Greg Botelho and Elizabeth Landau contributed to this report.","NEW: Coroner's office: The death certificate has December 12 as the date of death .

"Rajasthan, India (CNN) -- Rajinder Kumar has a spring in his step and a big smile on his face these days. The 35-year-old farmer from Sri Ganganagar, a district in Rajasthan, northwest India, says life has never been better. It's all because of what he grows in his fields -- a desert crop called guar. ""It's a miracle,"" he says. Guar gum powder, made by crushing seeds of the guar crop, is used in a number of products in the food and cosmetics industries, including ice cream, breads, pastries, lipsticks and even diapers. In just one year the price of guar has surged tenfold, from about 30 rupees (about 50 U.S. cents) to around 300 rupees for each kilogram of the precious seed. Behind the phenomenal price rise is a surge in demand. Oil and gas companies in the United States have developed a massive appetite for guar gum powder -- a key ingredient in a process called fracking, which is used to extract natural and shale gas from beneath the Earth's surface. Guar gum powder has unique binding, thickening and emulsifying qualities which make it ideal for fracking, explains B.D. Agarwal, the founder and managing director of Vikas WSP, an Indian company that specializes in producing the product. So far, oil companies have not been able to find a suitable substitute, he says. Since 90% of the world's guar is grown in the desert belt of northwest India, local farmers in this poor area are enjoying the benefit of the guar rush. Kumar says he had debts of almost $12,000. ""I thought I'd never be able to pay it off,"" he says. ""There is a saying that in a house where there's no food, there are fights. We used to fight all the time."" But thanks to the high price of guar these days, Kumar has been able to pay off his debt. He's building a house for his family, has bought mobile phones, an air cooler and a satellite dish. He can afford to send his children to school. ""We are all happy now,"" he adds. Agarwal, meanwhile, is confident the guar rush will grow. He says shale gas reserves have been identified in 32 countries and 48 basins around the world, including India. Only the U.S. and Canada, and very recently Argentina, have attempted to extract it. China is expected to start fracking by the end of the year. As demand grows, Agarwal predicts the value of the guar industry will jump, suggesting it could go from a $2 billion business today, to $200 billion by 2020. So he's encouraging farmers like Rajinder to keep growing it. In May this year, Vikas gave 15 kilograms of guar seeds to 200,000 farmers and guaranteed them returns. ""Everyone in the village is now growing guar,"" Kumar's wife, Dayawanti, says. ""No one talks of anything else. It's changed the village. If you came here two years ago, you wouldn't see joy on anyone's face."" Her neighbors' house is bursting with joy. Musicians beat traditional drums to welcome guests as the community gets together to celebrate a marriage. The bridegroom -- also a guar farmer -- says he would never have been able to afford this pomp if it wasn't for guar. Locals call the little green bean ""black gold"" and in Sri Ganganagar, it's easy to understand why.","Guar beans bringing relative riches to Sri Ganganagar in northwest India .

"Washington (CNN) -- Most Americans can put away winter coats and umbrellas and break out the short sleeves and sunglasses even though spring doesn't officially begin until next week, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In a 90-day weather outlook released Thursday, forecasters predict the unseasonably warm temperatures that have blanketed parts of the United States will continue into the summer, and much of the country will remain dry. In fact, for the first time in four years, no area of the country will face a high risk of major flooding from April through June, due in large measure to a winter without much snow, forecasters said. ""We expect above-normal temperatures in the South and Eastern United States,"" said Ed O'Lenic, chief of operations at the Climate Prediction Center for NOAA's National Weather Service. He predicts temperatures could be half a degree to a degree and a half above normal in many parts of the country. Above-normal temperatures are also predicted for the Southwest across Texas and the Gulf Coast, as well as the Atlantic Coast, the Ohio Valley and the Great Lakes region, according to NOAA. Temperatures in the Pacific Northwest and southern Alaska will be below normal. Tornado destroys Michigan homes . The heat has been on early this spring and the mercury has already broken records across the country. Nationwide, 577 record temperatures were broken Wednesday, including 400 high temperatures, according to Laura Furgione, deputy director at the National Weather Service. The weather service forecasts warm weather to continue well into next week. This is unwelcome news to parts of the South and West, where NOAA predicts the ongoing drought will persist and intensify through June. ""Drought is now encompassing parts of the West and Southwest, making conditions more favorable for wildfires,"" said David Brown, director of NOAA Southern Region Climate Services. ""If the drought persists as predicted, it will likely result in an active wildfire season, continued stress on crops and livestock due to low water levels and an expansion of water conservation measures,"" according to a NOAA statement. That's a stark contrast to last year's flooding along the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. ""What a difference a year makes,"" said Furgione. ""We're not forecasting a repeat of recent historic and prolonged flooding in the central and northern U.S., and that is a relief. The severity of any flooding this year will be driven by rainfall more so than the melting of the current snowpack.""","Above-normal temperatures forecast for most of U.S. this spring .

"(CNN) -- For more than 125 years, the City of Chester passenger ship has been at the bottom of San Francisco Bay. Scientists rediscovered its burial site recently after using sidescan sonar to confirm data first gathered last year. Researchers with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration were looking in May 2013 for another ship that sank near the Golden Gate Bridge in 1952 when they found what they thought was the City of Chester. They conducted what is called a multibeam sonar survey and over the next nine months sorted through the data. A follow-up look with sidescan sonar found the ship 216 feet beneath the surface, sitting upright in the mud. There was a fatal gash in the ship's port side. NOAA said in a news release that the discovery is an important one for the Chinese-American community in the San Francisco area. The City of Chester was carrying 90 people on a trip to Eureka, California, on August 22, 1888, when it was hit in the fog by the Oceanic, a ship arriving from Asia. The Chester sank within six minutes and 16 people were killed. The Chinese crew of the Oceanic initially was criticized but later praised as heroes. ""Discoveries like this remind us that the waters off our shores are museums that speak to powerful events, in this case not only that tragic wreck, but to a time when racism and anger were set aside by the heroism of a crew who acted in the best traditions of the sea,"" said James Delgado, the director of maritime heritage for NOAA's Office of National Marine Sanctuaries. The wreck was found in 1888 by the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, the predecessor of NOAA. NOAA will set up an exhibit about the City of Chester at a nearby marine sanctuary, but there are no plans to raise the ship.","The City of Chester was sailing in San Francisco Bay when it hit another ship, killing 16 .

"(CNN) -- Ali Abdul Razzaq's life in Iraq was still getting started when a bullet to the head killed the 9-year-old. Ahmad Rubaie was studying to become a doctor when his life ended. They were just two of a group of unarmed Iraqi civilians who died when four former Blackwater private security contractors opened fire at Nisur Square in Baghdad on September 16, 2007. Eighteen others were wounded in an incident that has been a controversial political and diplomatic case from the start and which still reverberates seven years later. On Tuesday, a District of Columbia jury began deliberations on whether the four guards -- Nicholas Slatten, Paul Slough, Evan Liberty and Dustin Heard -- are guilty or acted in self-defense. Only Slatten is charged with first-degree murder; that's in the slaying of the driver of a white Kia sedan in the Baghdad traffic circle. Prosecutors argued Slatten, the team's sniper, lit the fuse of the entire incident when he fired on and killed the driver. The Justice Department alleges the other three men ""unlawfully and intentionally, upon a sudden quarrel and heat of passion, did commit voluntary manslaughter"" in the ensuing chaos when they opened fire. The defendants deny all charges and say they acted in self-defense after they were fired upon by militants. Witnesses dispute the claim. 'It was horror' Attorney Hasan Jaber was driving to work when he got trapped in traffic at the square. That's when the shooting started. Like many others, he tried to flee, but he was shot three times. ""It was horror ... people were terrified,"" he said. ""People running out of their cars were being shot at ... anything that moved in Nisur Square was shot. Women, children, young people, they shot everyone."" Jaber testified in Washington and said he has faith in the American justice system. ""I felt that there are people who care about this,"" he said. ""I have trust that there will be justice."" Long road to trial . A federal judge in 2008 dismissed the original case, finding the Justice Department withheld key evidence and violated the guards' rights. But a federal appeals court later reversed that decision, leading the government to seek a fresh indictment and trial. The incident prompted international outrage at the time, and the criminal prosecution in the United States has dragged on for years. The killings led Iraq's government to slap limits on security contractors hired by various firms, including Virginia-based Blackwater, which was sold by founder Eric Prince and is known as Academi. ""The vast majority of the U.S. contractors who served in Iraq did so with honor and integrity, but, as alleged today, these defendants abused their power through a relentless attack on unarmed civilians that recklessly exceeded any possible justification,"" said U.S. Attorney Ronald C. Machen Jr. ""This prosecution demonstrates our commitment to upholding the rule of law even in times of war and to bringing justice to the memories of those innocent men, women, and children who were gunned down in Baghdad more than six years ago,"" he said. Prosecutor: Defendants did not have 'a blank check' On Thursday, U.S. Attorney Anthony Asuncion told the jury of five men and seven women in his closing argument that the former contractors, ""took something that didn't belong to them, the lives of 14 individuals."" ""People who could laugh and live were turned into bloody, bullet-ridden corpses by these men,"" Asuncion said, turning and pointing at the defendants. Prosecutors said the men fired at the Kia with machine guns and grenade launchers. Pictures of deceased and injured were displayed on a large board adjacent to the jury. ""None of these people were armed. None of these people on this board posed a threat to these men,"" Asuncion said. ""The fact this happened in a war-torn country did not give the defendants a blank check."" The former private security guards were working for Blackwater handling diplomatic security for the State Department. Their attorneys argued that Nisur Square, close to the fortified Green Zone, was a hostile environment. They said the Blackwater teams in the area were under constant threat, specifically from car bombs targeting convoys such as the one in which they arrived. ""Every civilian death in a war zone is a tragedy, but not every death is a crime,"" Brian Heberlig, a defense attorney for Slough, argued in his closings. The defense attorney said the guards were fired on by militants when they arrived in the traffic circle, a key point of disagreement between the defense and the prosecution. Heberlig said it was actually Slough, not Slatten, who fired first on the Kia at its engine block to try to stop the vehicle after the team perceived it to be a car bomb threat rapidly approaching their convoy. ""We know now it was a medical student and his mother,"" Heberlig said of the occupants of the sedan, ""but my client didn't know that at the time."" ""[Slough] did his job in Nisur Square and defended other Americans in an war zone."" Judge Royce Lamberth thanked the jury for their service during this long trial, which stretched over 44 days in court. After reading the lengthy charging documents, he sent them to lunch and then on to decide the case. 2011: Blackwater founder enters video game business .

"New York (CNN)  -- For Muslims living in the United States, the call to prayer requires a response at least five times a day. But when the U.S. Census Bureau comes calling once every 10 years, some Arab-Americans still hesitate to return the survey. ""There's a fear factor that this information may be used against you, or used for inappropriate reasons,"" said Rami Nuseir, president of the American Mideast Leadership Network. He said a misunderstanding of the census translates into some Arab-Americans simply not filling out the form. His organization is working directly with the Census Bureau to educate the Arab-American community about the importance of the survey. ""By law, the Census Bureau cannot share this information with the IRS, FBI, CIA or any other government agency,"" said Nuseir. ""We've been complaining about discrimination, we've been complaining about lack of resources, and here this is a chance to tell the whole world we exist."" The 2000 census estimated there were 1.2 million Arab-Americans living in the United States. But the Arab American Institute says that number is too low. Based on community surveys and immigration data, the nonprofit group says the real number is closer to 4 million. Mailing back the census form has benefits for the entire country. Data gathered from the survey helps disburse nearly $400 billion in federal funding. In addition, legislative districts are redrawn based on population change, providing important adjustments for representation in Congress. Recently, high school students at the Razi School in Queens, New York, attended a presentation on the census, given by Nuseir. The Muslim school is just one of many institutions where the Census Bureau is conducting sessions on the survey, hoping to reach parents through their children. Amirelsamad Isi is a senior at the Razi School. After the presentation, he was optimistic his parents would return their household's census form. ""In the beginning they might be a little scared, because everyone is scared. But when you learn the positive effects ... they'll learn, and they can tell other people,"" he said. In addition to sending its message into schools and mosques, the Census Bureau also has workers hitting the streets. Ahmed Shedeed, a Census Bureau partner specialist, was hired to specifically work the Arab-American community. For the past several months, he's visited New York and New Jersey neighborhoods, encouraging households to return their forms. In Astoria, Queens, Shedeed handed out flyers printed in Arabic to bolster participation and dispel anxieties about the census. ""I came to this country almost three years ago, and I know the fear,"" he said, handing the flyer to a young man outside a coffee shop. ""Everyone's information is well-protected."" The results of efforts put forth by census workers like Shedeed are already being measured. The 2010 Census Web site has an interactive map that shows what percentage of any U.S. region's population has returned the survey --  http://2010.census.gov/2010census/take10map/. As of Thursday, the national return rate was 52 percent. New York State trailed the national rate, at 46 percent. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg told CNN Thursday the rate of returns still lags in his city compared with the rest of the country. Thirty-seven percent in New York City have filled out the survey so far. Shedeed said he hopes his work pays off for Arab-Americans not just in Queens and not just in New York, but everywhere in the United States when the April 15 mailing deadline comes. ""It's our participation that will make everybody's life better,"" said Shedeed. ""It's important for our community to be known.""","Arab-Americans fear census information may be used against them, leader says .
