Denial: Comedian David Baddiel (pictured) has dismissed a newspaper report that he was going to take the Class A drug MDMA live on TV . Comedian David Baddiel has dismissed a newspaper report that he is planning to take Class A drugs live on TV as part of a scientific study. The Sun said the Three Lions star was going to sample MDMA for a Channel 4 series and then talk about its effects. But Baddiel, 47, has branded the claims a 'lie'. Writing on Twitter today, he said: 'For those congratulating me...I'm not going to be taking ecstasy live on C4. 'I believe it was written in The Sun? So, y'know: it's a lie.' MDMA, a pure form of ecstasy which causes euphoria and reduces anxiety, was made illegal in 1977. Scientists on the C4 show Drug Live are trying to establish if it can benefit people with post-traumatic stress disorder. The series, hosted by newsreader Jon Snow and Embarrassing Bodies presenter Dr Christian Jessen, will be examining the claims and counter-claims made about the effects of recreational drugs by testing them on live television. Channel 4 said individuals will be filmed as they use different substances 'under strict medical supervision and in a controlled clinical environment'. Their physical and psychological effects will then be monitored, as will their social interaction with others as the drugs enter their systems. Other celebrities are said to be taking part, although it is not known if they will be taking substances or merely forming part of the discussions. 'It's a lie': Baddiel's denial on Twitter after being made aware of the report . The four-part series, which airs in July, will also feature politicians, police officers and clergymen. Recreational drugs were used by 2.8million adults in England alone from 2009 to 2010, yet their dangers are disputed, with opinion having been divided between government policy-makers and scientists. The last Government dismissed its own chief scientific advisor and another expert has described the current classification of drugs as ‘a very British farce'. Star: Frank Skinner (centre), David Baddiel (right) and Ian Broudie from the Lightning Seeds who recorded Three Lions anthem ahead of the Euro 96 tournament in England . Specialist Factual Commissioning Editor David Glover says: 'This subject is fraught with controversy and confusion - this series will provide viewers with unmediated access to a live drug trial. 'Viewers will be able to see for themselves the actual effects the drugs have in scientific detail. 'We will work closely with the leading research institutes from across the world. The aim is to bring new clarity to the facts of illegal drug use.' Baddiel shot to fame in 1988 with the Radio 1 show The Mary Whitehouse Experience before teaming up with comedy partner Frank Skinner for the hugely popular Fantasy football League and later the TV series Baddiel and Skinner Unplanned. The duo twice topped the charts with the football anthem Three Lions written for the Euro 96 championships.","Three Lions star brands newspaper claim a 'lie'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 16:10 EST, 3 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 16:19 EST, 3 May 2012 . The wife of a former Minnesota Viking was convicted today of two felonies in a hit-and-run that killed a man. Amy Senser was charged with three felony counts of criminal vehicular homicide in the death of Anousone Phanthavong. Senser was found guilty of two counts: leaving the scene of an accident and failure to promptly report an accident. She was acquitted on a third felony charge of gross negligence. She was also convicted of misdemeanor careless driving. Deliberation: The jury found Amy Senser guilty of two of the three counts after she fatally hit Anousone Phanthavong on August 23 last year and left the scene of the accident . Senser, 45, of Edina, showed little emotion as the verdicts were read. She stared straight ahead. Jurors looked tense at the conclusion of the highly publicized trial, with one crying and dabbing at tears with a handkerchief. Senser was to remain free until . sentencing. Each felony count was punishable by up to ten years in . prison, but sentencing guidelines suggested four years for each count. The misdemeanor carried a potential sentence of up to 90 days in jail. To get a conviction on the first felony . count, the prosecution had to prove that she knew she hit a person. On . the second count, the prosecution needed to prove that not only did she . know she struck someone but that she failed to report it as soon as . reasonably possible. The third requires the jury to conclude she acted . with gross negligence, not just ordinary negligence. Phanthavong, 38, was a chef at a Thai . restaurant near the site of the accident. His car had run out of gas . and he had pulled to the side of the highway exit ramp. He was filling the car's tank when he . was hit. Parts of a Mercedes were found at the scene, and authorities . sought the public's help in finding the driver. Nearly 24 hours later, attorney Eric . Nelson called authorities to tell them they could pick up the vehicle . involved at the Sensers'. Despite giving up the vehicle, the . Sensers didn't talk to police, fueling speculation about who was driving . and whether alcohol was involved. It was more than a week later that Amy Senser admitted she was driving. Accused: Amy Senser, center, walks out of the Hennepin County Public Safety Facility with her lawyer, Eric Nelson, left, and her husband, Joe Senser, right, after one of her court appearances . At trial, her stepdaughter Brittani . testified that Amy Senser only came forward only after Brittani — angry . that some people had speculated she was the driver — threatened to go to . authorities. Amy Senser testified that the night . of the crash, she went to meet her daughters and their friends at a Katy . Perry concert at St Paul's Xcel Energy Center, and had part of a glass . of wine at a nearby restaurant before going inside. After about 90 minutes, suffering from a headache, she left, intending to have her husband pick up the girls. As she was driving home, she changed . her mind and decided to return to St Paul. Shortly after turning onto a . freeway exit ramp in a construction area in Minneapolis, Senser said she . felt a jolt at the front of her Mercedes-Benz SUV. She said she was looking to the left at the time, and thought she had hit an orange construction barrel or a pothole. It wasn't until the next day, when . her husband called her outside to look at the car and the couple saw . news reports about Phanthavong's death, that the couple called an . attorney. On the stand, she wept as she said she was still struggling to accept the fact that she had hit him. Brittani Senser, left, testified that she was . 'furious' that her stepmother, Amy Senser, pictured right, had not come . forward about driving the SUV that struck and killed a man as everyone then thought it was her . Drive: On the night of August 23, 2011, Amy Senser was behind the wheel of the Mercedes-Benz SUV that struck and killed 38-year-old Anousone Phanthavong but drove off after she hit him . Prosecutor Deborah Russell said in . closing arguments that Senser had to have known, and questioned whether . Joe Senser himself believed his wife. She reminded the jury of numerous texts Senser had deleted from her cellphone from the night of the crash and the next day. Phanthavong's family members have filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the Sensers seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Senser played four years with the Vikings in the early 1980s before a knee injury ended his career. He co-owns Joe Senser's Restaurant . and Sports Theater, a Minneapolis-St Paul-area restaurant chain, and has . worked as a Vikings radio color commentator.","Amy Senser was found guilty of leaving the scene of an accident and failure to report an accident .

A cancer doctor accused of plotting to kill his ex-wife's divorce lawyer said he wanted a picture of the attorney with a 'bullet between his eyes', a court heard. Police said a video showed Mississippi oncologist Ralph Arnold Smith Jr, 70, making the request of an alleged hitman. The lawyer was unhurt, however, because state agents were tipped off to the possible £20,000 murder-for-hire plot and were waiting at his office when the hitman arrived. Accused: Oncologist Ralph Arnold Smith Jr is said to have plotted to kill his ex-wife's divorce lawyer . Alleged assassin Keaira Byrd, 23, who was wearing a black ski mask, was killed in a shootout and his associate was severely wounded. Smith, 70, is charged with conspiring to kill attorney Lee Abraham, who represented his ex-wife. Records for the divorce were sealed in 2005, but docket entries show the couple fought over money long after it was granted in 1998. At a preliminary hearing at Leflore County Court yesterday, Greenwood police detective Jeff Byars said that the doctor kept a hidden camera in his office. Tearful: Smith's daughters, from left, Jennifer Welch, Victoria Smith and Kimie Smith, broke down after the case was sent to be heard by a grand jury . Distraught: The women sobbed as prosecutors outlined the case against their father . A video from the camera showed Smith telling Byrd that he wanted a photo showing Abraham dead, the policeman added. 'Take a picture of him with a bullet between his eyes,' Byars said in describing the video. The men’s faces were not visible on the video, and some of it was inaudible. Grin: Smith Jr smiles across the courtroom . Byars said that Bird was carrying a semi-automatic pistol with a 30-round clip when he walked into the lawyer’s office on April 28. It is not clear whether Byrd or the investigators fired first. Byrd’s associate, Derrick Lacy, 25, was shot several times in the back and in the leg. A bullet grazed an investigator. Lacy has been released on house arrest while he recovers. He is charged with capital murder and conspiracy to commit murder. Smith, with greying hair, white beard and glasses, sat with his legs crossed during the hearing with a brown envelope and his hands clasped on his lap. He shook his head from side to side when it was suggested he had hired someone to kill Abraham. Byars said a police investigation discovered a list of possible hit men and where they could be found. Onlookers gasped as names were read out. County Judge Kevin Adams decided there was enough evidence to send the case to a grand jury. The judge ordered the doctor to be held without bond on the capital murder charge and on a conspiracy to commit murder charge. Shootout: Greenwood Police Detective Sgt Jeff Byars shows the court a crime scene photograph of alleged hitman Keaira Byrd, lying dead on the floor of Abraham's office . Lethal: Byrd was carrying a semi-automatic pistol with a 30-round clip when he walked into Abraham's office, Byars said . Smith’s bond remained $100,000 on a second conspiracy to commit murder charge. The two conspiracy charges are both related to plots to kill Abraham, but involve different men the doctor approached to help carry out the plan, according to testimony. Cordarious Robinson, 22, is charged in the second conspiracy count. Authorities said Smith paid Robinson $15,000 for two guns and to 'put his ear to the ground to find someone to take out Lee Abraham'. It is not clear if Robinson enlisted Byrd, but authorities said the two men met on the day of the shooting. Smith’s relatives wept when the judge said he would remain in jail. Mississippi Bureau of Investigation agent Mark Steed said there was evidence that a plot against Abraham went back as far as two years.

A teenager who had just turned 18 was shot dead as she tried to protect her older sister during a domestic row in a Northern Ireland village. Lauren O'Neill was gunned down while visiting her older sister Brenda, 21, at her rented house in Bellaghy, County Derry yesterday. Brenda, a young mother-of-two, was also shot in the horrific shotgun attack and remains in a critical condition in hospital. Distraught residents in the quiet, tightly-knit County Derry community today claimed the gunman attacked his two victims with a shotgun, and even reloaded during his rampage. Tragic: Lauren O'Neill (right), who turned 18 two weeks ago, died after being shot while protecting her older sister Brenda (left) during a domestic feud . Lauren O'Neill, who had celebrated her 18th birthday just two weeks previously, was said to have died protecting her sister. A 26-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder around half an hour after the shooting, the PSNI said. Another man and a woman, both aged 28, were arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender. All three were detained in Toome, about five miles away from the scene of the gun attack. It is understood the dead girl had been living at her family home, in a neighbouring housing estate, and was visiting her older sister at the time of the shooting. Locals reported seeing and speaking with her in the village during the morning, before police were called to the scene at around 10.40am. Investigation: Police surround the scene of the shooting in County Derry, which happened on Saturday morning . Martin McGuinness, Northern Ireland's deputy first minister and Mid-Ulster MP, said his heart went out to the family of the girl tragically killed. 'People I have spoken to in the area this morning are in a state of shock,' he said. 'I would wish to extend my thoughts and prayers to the family and friends of the victim at this terrible time.' A PSNI spokesman said they were alerted to the shooting shortly before 10.40am today. He added: 'At around 11.10am, a 26-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder and a 28-year-old male and 28-year-old female were arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender. Shock: Locals in Bellaghy, County Derry, are said to be stunned by the tragic shooting, which happened in Brenda O'Neill's rented house . 'All three were arrested in the Toome area and have been taken to the Serious Crime Suite at Antrim police station.' Investigating officers have appealed for anyone with information about the incident to contact them. Caoimhe Scullion, Sinn Fein councillor on Magherafelt District Council who lives in Bellaghy, said the tight-knit village had been plunged into shock over the gun attack. 'Everybody is in complete shock,' she said. 'We hear these stories happening everywhere else, but you never think it will happen on your doorstep.' Ms Scullion said everybody knows everybody else in the small village. Ian Milne, also a Sinn Fein councillor who lives in Bellaghy, said the dead girl marked her 18th birthday within the last two weeks. 'The area is in total shock,' he said. 'Nobody can understand why this has happened. Everyone is very raw.' Mr Milne added: 'Our thoughts and prayers are with the family. We hope and pray the girl that is injured will make a recovery.' The scene remained sealed off and was being examined by forensic experts.","Lauren O'Neill 'died protecting her older sister' during domestic dispute .

Demanding: Queen Noor of Jordan, pictured here in 2009, is alleged to treated her head gardener unfairly . As one of the world’s wealthiest women, it may be rare for Queen Noor of Jordan to hear the word ‘No’. But some things are impossible, even for a queen, and growing mangoes in the cold climes of Britain surely falls into that category. That is the demand she is alleged to have made of the head gardener at her lavish Berkshire estate, Amanda Hill, who claims it was part of a culture of bullying that forced her to quit her job. Mrs Hill, 52, told a tribunal yesterday that Queen Noor bombarded her with ‘impossible’ requests – and said she was threatened by estate manager Caroline Migdadi when she was unable to fulfil them. She claims one such demand was when she was asked to grow mangoes and avocados in the garden at Buckhurst Park, Windsor, even though they can survive only in warm climates. She added: ‘When I pointed out that it is not possible to grow these fruits in the UK Mrs Migdadi informed me in a threatening manner, “Do you want to tell that to Her Majesty Queen Noor?”’ Mrs Hill claims she was even called back from holiday early on another occasion just because one of the queen’s daughters wanted to know the names of herbs. When she arrived at the estate, she discovered the daughter – Princess Raiyah – was not even in, but was made to carry out other menial tasks anyway. The claims form part of a constructive dismissal and sex discrimination case at Reading Employment Tribunal against Ambassador Marine Corporation, her employer. Mrs Hill’s witness statement reads: ‘I would never have imagined anything like this happening to me ever and it has caused me a great deal of pain and heartache. ‘All I wanted was to be treated fairly and with respect and dignity. During this period of time the majority of employees at Buckhurst Park have left. ‘There had become a culture of bullying and harassment and I feel sorry to have to say this and be here today.’ The gardener, from nearby Ascot, quit her £18,500-a-year job in January last year after a groundsman on the same salary, Daniel Welland, was given a pay increase to £22,500 but she was refused the same. Sprawling: Amanda Hill had worked as a head gardener at Buckhurst Park in Berkshire since 1996 . She told the tribunal he gradually took over her responsibilities and she was told he was better for garden work ‘because he was a man, he was stronger’. Mrs Hill said that when she complained, Queen Noor, 60, ‘then began to criticise the gardens even though the week before she had praised me on how wonderful the gardens looked’. She added: ‘I was told off about the ivy on the perimeter fence of the estate, how badly the roses had been pruned and the amount of weeds we had.’ Mrs Hill began work at the 60-acre estate in 1996 and was promoted to head gardener in 2006. Claim: Amanda Hill, pictured arriving at the employment tribunal hearing today, quit her £18,500 a year post in January last year . Her job was to maintain the gardens, orchards, woodlands and lakes for Queen Noor, who stays at the mansion for several months every year when not in the Middle East. In July 2010, Mrs Hill wrote to the queen’s PA to ask for a pay rise for both herself and Mr Welland. However, only Mr Welland got the extra money – and was promoted to head groundsman. Mrs Hill said she was excluded from meetings and recruitment procedures, told off in front of student interns and ignored when giving advice on tending roses and wisteria. The tribunal heard she was also kicked out of her office, with bin bags of her folders left outside. Queen Noor is the widow of King Hussein of Jordan, who died in 1999. Born Lisa Najeeb Halaby in the US, she has a degree in architecture and urban planning from the American university of Princeton. She worked on building projects all over the world before renouncing her US citizenship and marrying King Hussein in 1978. She was his fourth and last wife, and the couple had four children, Princes Hamzah and Hashim and Princesses Iman and Raiyah. After her husband’s death, Buckhurst Park was told to cut down on spending – but it is understood she still has access to considerable wealth. She chairs the Noor Al Hussein Foundation, an anti-poverty charity, and has spoken out in favour of peace between Western nations and the Middle East. Jordan is currently ruled by one of King Hussein’s children from his three previous marriages, King Abdullah II, and his wife Queen Rania. The hearing continues.","Royal demanded head gardener grew mangoes and avacados on her Berkshire estate .

The 22-month-old tumbled onto the roof of a shop below his flat in Lower Clapton, London and then teetered towards another 20 foot drop to the street below before a passerby dashed inside the building and scooped him to safety. The un-named toddler was rushed to nearby Homerton Hospital, where he was found to have escaped with a broken jaw, cuts and bruises. Miracle rescue: Onlookers watch as the baby is carried down a ladder to safety . Parents are now being warned to keep children away from open windows during the heatwave, as staff at another London hospital reveal they have treated four young children in the past 24 hours after falling from windows. Alistair Wilson, an A&E consultant at the Royal London Hospital told the Evening Standard: 'We have noticed a big rise in the number of children who have fallen out of windows during the recent hot spell. We would ask parents and carers to be careful and ensure children to are kept well away from open windows.' Police have meanwhile vowed to investigate how the 22-month-old was able to crawl from the third floor window of the six-storey building in Lower Clapton on Tuesday afternoon. Injured and scared: The toddler suffered a broken jaw, cuts and bruises after his fall . After spotting him staggering, dazed on the roof below, terrified passers by screamed at the confused and injured infant to stay where he was, fearing he would tumble off the roof and die. A quick-thinking eye-witness spotted the danger and dashed into the building. He clambered out of a first floor window to scoop up the battered baby in the nick of time. Another man grabbed a ladder from a shop so he could bring the stunned toddler down to safety as scores of locals gathered to watch. The child's grandmother said that his mother had left the room to get ready to go out. When she returned, he was nowhere to be seen.She told the Evening Standard: 'She thought he was playing hide and seek games. The windows open out wide and the window sill is low enough for a baby to climb up on.' Neighbour Agne Turkman, 26, saw the accident unfold from her second floor flat. She told the paper: 'A lady on a bike saw him up on the ledge and started screaming. I saw him afterwards and he was talking and breathing but his mouth was bleeding.' Sharon Barrett, manager of Social Care 4 U Ltd in the parade, also witnessed the heart-stopping incident. Mrs Barrett said: 'Everybody was screaming and then the mother ran down on to the street. 'She was screaming and was very distressed.' 'A guy got on to the ledge to get the baby and somebody flagged down a passing police van.~ . A Met Police spokeswoman said: ;The one-year-old male infant was conveyed to an east London hospital, where it was established that he had sustained a broken jaw. His injuries were not deemed life-threatening or changing. Enquiries into the incident are ongoing.'

For most children, getting their hands on an iPad is an opportunity to play games, watch videos and surf the internet. But at one primary school the Apple devices are being put to a more serious use – as a teaching tool for lessons in everything from maths to music. Thirty-two iPads have been bought at a cost of £13,000 so that a whole class can use them at the same time. Children as young as four are taking part. Hands-on learning: A junior class at North Crescent Primary School get to grips with their new educational tool . Lisa Wright, who is headmistress of North Crescent in Wickford, Essex, said the flexibility of the curriculum meant the iPads could be used right across the primary school. ‘Year Four children have used them in maths lessons and reception children have played some maths and phonics games,’ she said. ‘Year Ones had them in their religious education lesson and Year Five and Six pupils have been using iPads in their topics, such as learning about the Titanic by getting on the internet.’ The use of iPads is part of an overhaul of information and communications technology at the 214-pupil school. Mrs Wright added: ‘We bought the iPads because they’re so flexible and versatile. We’ve got a lovely outdoor space here so the children can take them outside and even use them to take pictures. Focus: The iPads are used by all year groups and in all subjects at the primary school . ‘We want learning to be fun for the children. The iPads are in use all the time. ‘If you walk around the school, there’s a child somewhere or a group using the iPad which is what I want to see.’ However, Mrs Wright insists books and conventional teaching methods such as pencil and paper are equally important. Thought: The school spent £13,000 on 32 of the expensive Apple tablet devices . Earlier this year, Labour education spokesman Stephen Twigg claimed school textbooks could be replaced by devices. An Ofsted report last year said pupils were showing high degrees of concentration when doing mental arithmetic on handheld games consoles. But Dr Aric Sigman, a fellow of the Royal Society of Medicine, has argued against a technology ‘free for all’. ‘Children first need to learn how to concentrate before they start dividing their attention up with different windows on a screen and different forms of entertainment,’ he said.","Bosses at North Crescent Primary School spend £13,000 on 32 Apple tablets ."

Police turned away hundreds of protesters yesterday at the site of a genetically modified crop experiment. Officers prevented the activists from entering the field of chemically altered wheat, which they had planned to pull out of the ground. Two men were arrested during the demonstration, which had been arranged to ‘decontaminate’ land being used by scientists trying to produce GM wheat that deters pests. Security: Extra police had to be called in to deal with today's protest near Harpenden, Hertfordshire . Protest: One demonstrator makes a heart symbol in front of police forces. The trial’s opponents claim the crops could contaminate the surrounding environment, as the experiment is being carried out in the open air. St Albans City and District Council applied to the Home Office for greater police powers in anticipation of the protest, and an order banning activists from Rothamsted Research’s site in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, was issued on Friday. Those operating under the name ‘Take The Flour Back’ said 400 members sat in front of officers guarding the wheat field and sang protest songs for half an hour before gathering in nearby Rothamsted Park. Human wall: Take The Flour Back said around 400 people demonstrated, including French protest group The Volunteer Reapers . Barrier: An emergency order has been granted by the Home Office requiring protestors to stay off the land until midnight . Plea: Professor Maurice Maloney, left, has urged the protestors to debate the issue with the researchers . Police stressed that despite the two arrests there were ‘no disturbances in the area’, but claimed there were only 200 protesters present. Aphids – greenfly and blackfly – are the bane of farmers’ lives because of the damage they do to plants by feasting on the sugars in their leaves. The wheat grown at Rothamsted  releases a chemical that greenfly recognise as an 'air raid warning' of an attack by a predatory parasitic wasp. Scientists hope it will keep aphids away and attract wasps to further control the pests. They say it is a ‘natural’ form of GM, which could stop farmers having to use toxic pesticides and could also be used in other plants. The gene that produces the chemical, was taken from a peppermint plant and inserted into the wheat crops. A message on Take The Flour Back’s website said: ‘This open air trial poses a real, serious and imminent contamination threat to the local environment and the UK wheat industry.’ However, Professor Maurice Moloney of Rothamsted Research insisted that the chance of any cross-pollination was minuscule. ‘We have no idea who is advising them scientifically because it is absolutely incorrect,’ he said. The organisation’s GM wheat, which was planted last month, has been developed with genes from the mint plant. Professor Moloney explained: ‘The wheat produces a volatile chemical which the aphids don’t like and it makes them go elsewhere. ‘The purpose of it is to see if we can come up with a strategy that would avoid the use of pesticides in wheat crops, as they kill other creatures like bumblebees.’ A Rothamsted Research spokesman said it was pleased that the protest was peaceful, and that ‘both supporters and opponents had the chance to make their voices heard’.

Leeds United chairman Ken Bates has been ordered to pay £10,000 to an ex-director who sued him for harassment. Melvyn Levi and his wife Carole claimed they suffered stress as a result of announcements on the club radio station allegedly likening Mr Levi to a criminal on the run. They also claimed comments made by Mr Bates in his match day programme notes amounted to speculation over the state of their marriage. Mr Levi was awarded £10,000 in compensation at Leeds County Court but his wife’s claim failed. Judge Mark Gosnell said: 'Mr Levi has succeeded in his claim and has been awarded £10,000 and Mrs Levi’s claim has failed. Damages: Leeds United chairman Ken Bates (left) has been ordered to pay £10,000 to Melvyn Levi, (right) an ex-director who sued him for harassment . Mr Bates is also now subject to an injunction banning him from discussing Mr Levi’s private life in public for two years. But the Leeds chairman is allowed to mention the on-going commercial dispute between the two, known as the 'Jersey proceedings', as well as other non-private matters. Explaining why he was granting the injuction, the judge said: 'I cannot think of a better reason than the delving into Mr Levi’s private life in what is a commercial dispute between Mr Levi and Mr Bates which I hope will be resolved by someone else on another day.' Mr Levi claimed radio announcements asking for information on his whereabouts during a Leeds match on Boxing Day 2010 likened him to 'a fugitive'. Over that Christmas period, Mr Bates was trying to serve a writ against Mr Levi but found out from his wife that he was away until the new year. The Leeds chairman was pursuing legal action against Mr Levi for £190,400 Mr Bates claims he and another party owed the club - the subject of the Jersey proceedings. Captive audience: Leeds United's home ground Elland Road, where Mr Bates is said to have used the PA system to ask fans for details on Mr Levi's whereabouts as he tried to serve him with court papers . At an earlier hearing, Mr Bates was . accused of using the club’s programme to pursue a personal vendetta and . make the lives of the Levis 'a misery' after he wrote an article in . January last year speculating on why the couple had 'split' over the . festive season. In 2009 . Mr Levi sued Mr Bates for libel over articles written in the programme . and the Leeds chairman was ordered to pay £50,000 damages plus costs to . Mr Levi. Mr . Bates, Leeds United and Yorkshire Radio have been ordered to pay the . damages, their own legal costs and 30% of the Levis’ legal costs. It . emerged during the case that the Boxing Day 2010 radio announcement was . played numerous times and a similar message had been broadcast on two . days in the previous week. The . announcement said: 'Leeds United are currently searching for the . whereabouts of Melvyn Levi to serve him some papers in relation to a . High Court action in Jersey. 'Now, if you’ve seen the former Leeds United director, you’re being asked to get in touch with Yorkshire Radio and let us know where and when you saw him.' Mr Bates’s programme notes of January 1 2011, entitled 'Onwards and Upwards', said: 'As I write, we have not served Mr Levi with his writ as his wife said he was away until New Year which makes me speculate as to why they split for the festive season. 'No matter, the procedure will be processed in 2011. Watch this space for continuing exciting news of a saga which will soon challenge Coronation Street as a long-running soap.' In his written judgment, Judge Gosnall said he was convinced Mr Bates’s comments had genuinely upset Mr Levi and said it had affected the claimant's life. Referring to Mr Levi he said: 'He has low mood and anxiety, constantly ruminates on why the first defendant (Mr Bates) has had such a grudge against him for so long, he has sleep disturbance, a sense of fear and is on edge. 'He says the thing he fears the most is being accosted or attacked as a result of all the things which have been said about him.'","Melvyn Levi and his wife Carole claimed they suffered stress as a result of announcements on the club radio station .

A mother's new boyfriend allegedly shook her six-month-old son to death while babysitting him after being angered by a row with his ex-girlfriend. Jason Redgrave, 24, had arrived at girlfriend of one month Karly Hopson's home in Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, to babysit little Ethan so she could go out for a friend's birthday. But he allegedly turned up in a bad mood following the row with his ex-girlfriend and mother of his three-year-old son after she refused to tell him where she was going on a night out, Hull Crown Court heard. Prosecuting, Nicholas Lumbley, QC, said Redgrave had been constantly texting a . male friend before Miss Hopson had even left the house. He then allegedly shook or slapped the . baby so hard it caused major brain injuries which lead to his death, the court was told. Mr Lumbley told the jury: 'Ethan Hopson was a . perfectly healthy, happy boy who was normal in every way, other than the . odd snuffle or bug. He 'would have had his first birthday this . week. The fact he has not done so is because this man shook and hit him . with such force that he suffered from head injuries from which he never . recovered. 'The prosecution says that this . defendant is guilty of murder. While he may not have set out to kill . him, he caused these injuries and he did so causing really serious harm, . even if there was only a momentary intent to cause that harm.' Redgrave told police he had played with Ethan before putting him to bed and had then . returned downstairs to watch the MTV awards and Match of the Day. He . said he had gone upstairs to check on Ethan after hearing him scream, the court heard. Redgrave told police he had picked the baby up and . soothed him, rocking him back to sleep. At about 10pm he said he heard . another scream and went upstairs to look. After settling the baby again he went back downstairs. But, around 10.45pm, during a first . game interval in Match of the Day, Redgrave made a 'purely speculative' check on Ethan and told police he found him lifeless. In happier times: Redgrave allegedly shook or slapped the baby so hard it caused major brain injuries which lead to his death, Hull Crown Court heard . He said he . put his finger in the baby's palm, but there had been no . response. The jury listened to a 999 made by Redgrave after he called Miss Hopson who then . raced home. Redgrave told the operator: 'I am . looking after my girlfriend’s baby and he is barely breathing. He is not . clutching my hand or anything. He is six months old. I have laid him . down flat because I don’t know what position to put him in.' Asked by the operator: 'Is he awake?' Redgrave replied: 'No! No!' 'Is he unconscious?' the operator asked. Redgrave replied: 'I think he is. I . don’t think he has a pulse. Please! Please come! Oh S***! I can’t hear . any breathing. Oh my God he’s gone! He’s gone!' Victim: Ethan Hopson died later in Sheffield Hospital as a result of numerous non-accidental injuries, the court heard . The line then went dead,' the court heard. Miss Hopson arrived home . to find her son on the sofa with a paramedic and asked Redgrave what . had happened. Mr Lumbley told the court that Redgrave had explained how he had gone upstairs to check on Ethan and he was . not breathing properly. 'He said he had picked him up and his head had . rolled back and that was when he sent a text message to Karly, saying ""Karly ring me now!""' Mr Lumbley added Redgrave had told her in a panic: 'They are going to think I have done it. I am going to go to prison.' Redgrave then sent a text message to his ex girlfriend asking her to ring him, which she did. He gave her the same account, Mr Lumbley said. Ethan Hopson died later in Sheffield Hospital as a result of numerous non-accidental injuries, the court heard. Miss Hopson had overheard Redgrave say: 'I feel sick' when police approached him at the hospital. After they had arrested him, Redgrave told them: 'It's at times like this I wish I had . a bag to put over my head,' the court heard. There was evidence of a slap to the left side of Ethan's face, bruising between the eyes and two deep skull bruises beneath the . scalp near his left ear. There were tears to tissue . consistent with acceleration and declaration of the head as if it had . been shaken, the court heard.There was also widespread and severe damage to the . brain caused by lack of oxygen. Mr Lumbley said the type of injuries Ethan suffered suggested there was a deliberate intention to apply force and that the jury could be sure there was a case for murder. Redgrave told police he would never . hurt a child and did nothing that night to injure the baby. He admitted . when pressed: 'I picked him up and shook him and rocked him to sleep. I . put him back down to sleep. I did not harm him in any way. If I was . going to harm a child I would harm my own baby first. I did not do . anything to that child to cause those injuries.'

Long-time Japanese rivals Sony and Panasonic are working together to develop next-generation TV panels called OLEDs in a reversal of decades of rivalry as they try to catch up with South Korea's Samsung Electronics. The companies said in a joint statement Monday they will share core technologies to develop OLED, or organic light-emitting diode, panels. They are aiming for low-cost mass production by 2013. Both Sony and Panasonic have posted big losses after falling behind Samsung Electronics and other Asian rivals in TVs. Joint strength: A model poses with a 55-inch Samsung OLED TV during a May press conference in Seoul, South Korea . The joining of forces marks a departure from a long rivalry and highlights the pressure that Japanese manufacturers face to catch-up with Samsung in TVs. Samsung is planning to start selling TVs with big OLED screens later this year. OLEDs use a different technology from Liquid Crystal Displays and delivers very clear, vivid imagery. Fitch Ratings said the Sony-Panasonic tie-up underlined 'the fall of Japanese tech companies,' as such a tie-up was previously 'unthinkable.' 'Japanese OLED investment is better late than never,' said Alvin Lim, Associate Director at Fitch. Financial implications: Both Sony and Panasonic have posted big losses after falling behind Samsung Electronics and other Asian rivals in TVs . 'While consumer demand for OLED is still unproven, without investment Japanese manufacturers could become stranded in the TV market should this technology become mainstream.' Sony was the first in the world to sell an OLED TV, with its 11-inch model in 2007, but it wasn't a strong seller, partly because of its small size. Sony buys liquid-crystal displays from other manufacturers. It ended its joint-venture with Samsung to make LCDs earlier this year as panel prices fell and it became more cost-efficient to buy from other makers. Both Sony and Panasonic reported record losses for the fiscal year ended March 31. They took a battering from plunging prices and a soaring yen, which puts the Japanese at a disadvantage against the Koreans, in price competitiveness. Analysts say the Japanese could also be hit by Apple Inc.'s foray into TVs that may come in a couple of years. Apple has already eroded the profitability of the Japanese electronics makers with its hit iPod, iPhone and iPad devices.","Said they will share core technologies to develop organic light-emitting diode panels .

Trouble ahead: Ms Sandberg and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg rings the Nasdaq's opening bell for the company's initial public offering . Facebook's initial public offering of stock priced at $38 and raised $16billion for Facebook and some of its early investors. It had valued the company at $104billion - more than Amazon.com Inc., at $98billion, at the time. The couple have travelled to the picturesque part of Southern Italy - a part of the country so beautiful it has been declared a World Heritage Site - from Rome, where they have spent the past few days sight-seeing. Yesterday the newlyweds were spotted brushing up on some Italian architecture as they toured the Sistine Chapel. A fellow tourist snapped the Facebook CEO as he wandered around the chapel in the Vatican with a priest and tour guide, occasionally placing an affectionate hand on his new bride's back. Zuckerberg and his wife listened intently to a guide explaining the marvels of the stunning 500-year-old paintings that adorn the walls and ceilings. Eschewing glitzy restaurants and stiff luxury dining, the two opted for a meal at a Kosher restaurant called Nonna Betta in Rome's Jewish Ghetto where they enjoyed a simple Italian meal of fried pumpkin flowers and ravioli in an artichoke sauce. Their bill, which was immediately posted online, revealed that the two sipped tea and water, and paid just 32 euros for their feast - a mere drop in the ocean of Zuckerberg's fortune. But the stock's public debut was marred by technical glitches at the Nasdaq Stock Market that delayed trading. And the company, along with the investment banks that led the IPO, is the subject of at least two shareholder lawsuits.

Amid a flurry of lawsuits over . Facebook's IPO, Morgan Stanley announced in a memo on Wednesday that it . is reviewing Facebook trades and would adjust prices for some retail . customers who overpaid. The IPO mishaps have sparked numerous . lawsuits against Morgan Stanley, the Nasdaq stock exchange and Facebook . itself by shareholders who claimed they hid the social networking . company's weakened growth forecasts just before it went public. The allegations raised questions about whether top investors profited at the expense of smaller buyers. The insider spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Facebook's much-anticipated IPO was delayed by a half-hour on Friday because of technical glitches on the Nasdaq. After pricing at $38, Facebook's stock initially closed up 23 cents on Friday and has been down since. In a sign of how feeling is changing . against Facebook, some commentators have begun comparing its activities . to the most reckless behaviour of Wall Street banks.

Joyce Connolly and her daughters left their home in Hurricane, West Virginia, to head south for a Memorial Day beach vacation — and ended up in the center of Tropical Storm Beryl. While it left little damage after sweeping ashore with 70mph winds after midnight on Monday at Jacksonville, Florida, the storm still wrecked much of Connolly's trip. Scroll down for video .

She skipped a graduation because powerful winds kept her and her daughters from venturing past the beach boardwalk when the storm approached on Sunday.

Skip Sasser, who oversees the island's lifeguards as its fire chief, said beach traffic was unusually thin for a holiday. The ocean was declared off-limits to swimmers for a second day in a row. 'It's been raining intermittently, so it's chased a lot of them off,' Sasser said. 'There was a lot of traffic this morning heading westbound out of Tybee.' Veterans groups, meanwhile, carried out outdoor Memorial Day ceremonies despite the grim forecast. At Savannah's historic Bonaventure Cemetery, American Legion members worked through a downpour to make sure its plot for veterans had a small American flag planted by each headstone. 'When we were setting up, I had a different shirt on and I got soaked to the skin. My socks and my underwear probably are, too,' said Jim Grismer, commander of American Legion Post 135 in Savannah. 'I had so many people trying to talk me into moving it inside. But I said then you can't have the live firing salute and the flag raising.' Aside from ruining holiday plans, the rain was welcome on the Georgia coast for bringing some relief from persistent drought. According to the state climatologist's office, as of May 1, rainfall in Savannah was 15 inches below normal for the past 12 months. Emergency officials said minor flooding was reported near the coast, but the ground was quickly soaking up the water. And the winds had died down considerably. 'We've needed it for a long time,' said Ray Parker, emergency management director for coastal McIntosh County south of Savannah, who said the worst damage came by trees falling on two homes overnight. 'We were lucky that we didn't get 3 to 4 inches in 30 minutes. Most of it soaked right in before it had a chance to run off. It fell on an empty sponge.' The rainfall stopped in Savannah and other northern parts of the Georgia coast on Monday afternoon, but more was expected through Tuesday. A frontal system moving south from the Great Lakes is expected to cause the storm do a U-turn and push it back out to sea. According to NBC News, Beryl is the strongest May tropical cyclone to hit the U.S. since a hurricane hit the Outer Banks of North Carolina with winds of 75 mph on May 29, 1908. The National Hurricane Center in Miami reported that the center of Beryl made landfall near Jacksonville Beach at around 12.10am with reports that the weather system was in the process of making landfall. 'There are strong rain bands that are rotating around the center of the storm,' forecaster Al Sandrik said in an audio statement on the NHC website. Danger: This map shows tropical storm warnings in in the Southeast, while thunderstorms threaten a ridge of Midwestern and Great Plains states . So close: A shot of Tropical Storm Beryl on Saturday shows just how near to the coastline it is . At 8pm last night, Beryl was packing sustained winds near 70 miles per hour and located about 75 miles east of Jacksonville, Florida, the hurricane center said. An increase in wind speeds to 74 miles per hour or more would make it a Category 1 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson intensity scale. Beach-goers and campers already had their Memorial Day weekend plans ruined as they were forced to pack up and leave the coastline to go inland. A tropical storm warning remained in effect early today for coastal areas from Flagler Beach, Florida to Edisto Beach, South Carolina, according to MSNBC. But the storm is forecast to weaken throughout today and tomorrow as winds die down. 'We're seeing about the best that Beryl has right now as far as its winds are concerned, with winds about 70 mph,' forecaster Al Sandrik told the station. 'The model shows significant weakening of the storm in 12 hours.' Other forecasters said the storm surge and high tide could bring up to four feet of flooding in northeastern Florida and Georgia. The storm's approach led some vacationers in Georgia to leave early, said Alden Alias, the front desk manager at The King and Prince Hotel on St Simons Island, a popular coastal resort town. 'The waves are pretty big,' she said. 'The winds are starting to pick up.' City officials in Jacksonville canceled Memorial Day ceremonies scheduled for Monday and closed some local parks as the storm drew closer. ""I am encouraging all area residents to stay indoors and off the streets as the storm hits,"" said Jacksonville Mayor Alvin Brown. Overcast: Beachgoers stayed outside on Sunday, even as Tropical Storm Beryl drew closer to shore and began to turn the weather sour . Forced out: These vacationers at Wrightsville Beach in North Carolina are likely to have their trips to the beach ruined when the storm makes landfall . 'A three-day thunderstorm is what it's probably going to be,' said Jay Wiggins, emergency management director for Glynn County, which is about 60 miles south of Savannah and includes Brunswick and St. Simons Island in Georgia. 'Unfortunately, it's going to ruin a lot of Memorial Day plans.' Wiggins said he expects some flooded roadways and scattered power outages, perhaps some minor flooding in waterfront homes, but otherwise little damage. However, he urged beachgoers to beware of dangerous rip currents. Computer forecast models show Beryl moving on an eventual path back out over the Atlantic after coming ashore, posing no threat to U.S. oil and gas installations in the Gulf of Mexico. The storm is forecast to dump as much as 4 to 8 inches of rain, with as much as 12 inches in some areas, and threatens rip currents and possible coastal flooding, the hurricane center said. Beryl formed off the South Carolina coast late on Friday as a subtropical storm, a reference to the storm's structure. Subtropical storms usually have a broader wind field than tropical storms and shower and thunderstorm activity farther removed from the storm's center. It was reclassified as a tropical storm on Sunday.

Never forgotten: U.S. military veterans salute during a wreath-laying ceremony at the grave of an unknown Union soldier who died during the Civil War at the Congressional Cemetery in Washington, DC . Beryl followed the season's first major storm, Tropical Storm Alberto, which was the earliest-forming Atlantic storm since 2003. The Atlantic hurricane season officially runs from June 1 to November 30. While Georgia hasn't taken a direct hit from a major hurricane in 114 years, the last time a tropical storm made landfall here was in August 1988. Tropical Storm Chris hit near Savannah but did little damage as it pushed northward into South Carolina. In South Carolina, Beaufort County Emergency Management deputy director David Zeoli said Saturday that word went out to first-responders along the coast near the Georgia line to pay attention to the storm's progress.

The cause was a powerful thunderstorm which was raging across the north eastern coast, with Philadelphia International Airport also experiencing departure delays of anywhere up to 45 minutes.

Britain will find it almost  ‘impossible’ to fight simultaneous wars after dramatic cuts to the Armed Forces, the former head of the Army warned yesterday. Lord Dannatt said it was a ‘risky’ policy to slash the numbers of service personnel to their lowest levels for more than a century in a bid to cut costs. His comment came as 3,800 members of the Armed Forces were yesterday given redundancy letters. Lord Richard Dannatt said it was a 'risky' policy to slash troop numbers . Some 2,900 soldiers received their notice. A total of 170 sailors and 730 RAF personnel were also made redundant. The Army is facing another wave of severe cuts as early as next year to bring numbers down from their current level of 97,000 to 82,000 – its smallest size since the Boer War at the end of the 19th Century. Former Army chief General Sir Richard Dannatt, now Lord Dannatt, warned: ‘In future we won’t be able to do the kind of things we have done on the scale we have done them in the past. That’s fine as long as the next decade is more peaceful.’ Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said fewer than anticipated were being axed from the Royal Navy and the RAF . Asked whether Britain could fight simultaneous wars like it did in Iraq and Afghanistan, Lord Dannatt told the BBC: ‘It will be very difficult, verging on the impossible to do that when the Army is down to 82,000 by 2020.‘I know the policy is to rely very much more heavily on the reserves and that policy could work but it’s a risky policy and it’s unproven. I’m not saying what the Government is doing is wrong, but there are risks.’ Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said the cuts were regrettable, but necessary to plug a ‘multi-billion pound black hole in the defence budget’ left by the Labour government. Mr Hammond said: 'Of course I regret . that it has been necessary to make redundancies to deliver our plans for . reducing the size of the armed forces. 'We’ve now brought the defence budget back into balance for the first time in a generation. 'We will have smaller armed forces but we will ensure they will have the protection and equipment they need. Mr . Hammond meeting members of the Brigade Advisory Group at Camp Bastion . in Afghanistan today. The MoD is trying to reduce the size of the Army . to 82,000 . 'The . Royal Navy and RAF redundancy figures are smaller than anticipated due . to the MoD’s ability to use other measures, such as slowing recruitment. 'No . further significant reductions are expected for the Royal Navy or RAF. We still have some way to go to bring the size of the Army down to . 82,000 and decisions on what is necessary to achieve this are yet to be . taken, but we won’t compromise the mission in Afghanistan.' But Shadow Defence Secretary Jim Murphy said: ‘Savings have to be made, but we worry important skills and capabilities are being lost without thought for our Forces’ role in the world.’","There are 3,800 redundancies in total and 30 per cent are compulsory .

A teenager found guilty of stabbing 21-year-old Steven Grisales to death last August in a row over a game of conkers has been jailed for a minimum of 10.5 years. After the sentence was passed at the Old Bailey  the 15-year-old youth was led to the cells amid shouts of 'love you' as he waved to the public gallery. Mr Grisales' father blasted the short sentence saying that 50 years would not be enough for the murder of his 'perfect son'. Senseless: Steven Grisales died after he went over to remonstrate with three boys throwing conkers still in their spiky husks . Steven Grisales died after he got in an argument with three boys who were throwing conkers still in their spiky husks on August 31 last year. Mr Grisales had been shopping for his grandmother and was walking to Silver Street station, Edmonton, north London, when he was attacked in College Close. During the trial earlier this year the Old Bailey heard the boys had . been throwing conkers at two female friends before Steven was nearly . struck by a flying chestnut hurled by one of the men, triggering the . row. Witnesses said they saw the youths argue with Mr Grisales before one of them stabbed him in the chest. Residents came to his aid but he later died in hospital from his injuries. The youth, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, denied being the killer but was found guilty of murder at the Old Bailey, last month. Judge Richard Marks ordered that the youth be detained at Her Majesty's Pleasure with a minimum term of 10.5 years. At the time of the killing he was under a youth rehabilitation order, imposed just weeks earlier for burglary. However, he had cut off of his electronic tag in order to break his 9pm curfew. Judge Marks said Mr Grisales was 'an outstanding human being in many ways'. The convicted teen already has two convictions for two separate robberies - committed within months of each other - from 2009, including one in which an accomplice was armed with a metal compass. One another occasion he was caught with a knife at school. Murder scene: College Close, Edmonton where Mr Grisales was stabbed. The accused blamed another youth but was identified from his clothing on CCTV . Judge Marks said his pre-sentence . report made ""grim reading"" and mentioned two incidents with knives, one . at school and the other involving his mother. Steven's father, Jasmid Andreas was shocked to hear about his son's murderer's past. Condemning the 'senseless killing' of his 'perfect son' he said: 'It was amazing . learning how many offences he has done - violence, robbery, and so many . times nothing is done.' Speaking of the jail term he said: 'Ten and a half years for taking away our son, taking away his . future, and all of his plans... It's a very short sentence. 'You could give him 50 years and it would make no difference. 'After hearing all the evidence we know he was just passing by and conkers were thrown at him - he was just defending himself. 'He was never in a fight, never in trouble.' But Judge Richard Marks QC refused to lift an order banning the identification of the killer after being told he would be appealing his conviction. He said of Mr Grisales: 'No sentence I pass could bring him back or is likely to be regarded by his family as sufficient punishment for what you did.' He told the killer: 'Having been handed that knife, you stabbed Steven Grisales through the chest and then ran away, totally indifferent to the fate he had suffered. 'You have continued to deny the offence, seeking to blame a friend of yours for what happened and so have shown no regret or remorse whatsoever for what the jury found you did. 'For one so young you have a bad record.' The sentence was reduced from 12 years - the starting point for a juvenile convicted of a knife murder - because of the killers age and because it could not be proved he had taken the knife with him to the scene, the judge added. Steven’s mother Jasmid said in a statement: 'Steven was always loved by every person who had the privilege of knowing him.' His organ donations following his death helped to save the lives of three women.Outside the court a woman wearing a T-shirt bearing the slogan 'My friend is innocent', shouted: 'The police have been lazy. 'All they want is a conviction - it doesn't matter who did it,' said the woman, who identified herself only as a friend of the family. 'Your true killer will be brought to justice. 'Rest in peace Steve - my heart goes out to your family - but they have got the wrong person.'","21-year-old Steven Grisales was killed last August .

The young woman whose body was attacked by a flesh-eating bacteria is finally making preparations to leave hospital, nearly two months after she arrived. Aimee Copeland, from Georgia, is finally moving into a rehabilitation centre after the aggressive disease forced doctors to amputate her left leg, right foot and both hands. Her delighted family say the 24-year-old will be transferred on Monday and will spend several weeks learning to move, before gradually returning to normal life. Scroll down for video . New life: Aimee (right, with her sister) is finally leaving hospital for a rehabilitation centre . Her father Andy said he was 'real excited about leaving' the hospital and 'just wants a change of venue.' The University of West Georgia graduate . will be transferred from Doctors Hospital in Augusta to the in-patient . rehab centre on Monday, but her father declined to say where the therapy centre was. The 24-year-old developed necrotizing fasciitis in a small cut she suffered after falling from a homemade zip line over a west Georgia river. She is staying in close touch with her friends and makes regular hour-long phone calls, according to Gary Duke, owner of Sunnyside Cafe, where she used to work. 'She sounds strong and in reasonably good spirits,' Mr Duke told Times Georgian yesterday. Mr Copeland, who has been keeping a blog about his daughter's condition, posted online to describe the moment she ventured outside yesterday, for . the first time since she was admitted to hospital 49 days earlier. Smiles all around: Aimee Copeland has been pictured for the first time since she lost her limbs to flesh-eating bacteria. The image shows her grinning outside the hospital with her parents . 'The look on Aimee's face was just . incredible,' her father, Andy Copeland, told Good Morning America. 'She could smell the pine trees and feel the . breeze through her hair and just the sun on her skin. That was a . remarkable change for her just to see how she glowed when we took her . outside.' While there, they took a photograph of Aimee grinning with her hair pulled into a side ponytail, with her parents smiling either side of her. Bandages cover the ends of her arms. 'Aimee has a beauty in this photograph that I think goes beyond words,' Andy Copeland said. 'It's a beauty of survival, of resilience.' Proud: Her father, Andy Copeland, holds up the photo during an interview with Good Morning America . Her remarkable achievement came just a . day after doctors upgraded her condition from serious to good. Mr Copeland wrote that, once the family was outside, they reflected on the life-changing events - and Aimee showed breathtaking courage. 'I don’t have any regrets about what has happened,' Aimee told her father. 'I don’t focus on what I’ve lost, I would rather focus on what I’ve gained. I feel like I’ve been blessed.' She went on: 'I am blessed to have the opportunity to experience something that not many other people have the chance to experience. Upbeat: On a blog, Aimee's father has said he is amazed by her courage and determination to walk . 'I am blessed to have the capacity to . share my experience with others and have a chance to improve the quality . of someone else's life. I’m blessed to be different.' Speaking to GMA, her father spoke of her determination to walk at her Master's graduation ceremony this December. 'You heard the word right,' he said. 'Walk. That's what she intends to do.' Earlier this month, Mr Copeland said his daughter had been enduring the worst pain of the ordeal. Her agony was so overwhelming that she began taking morphine after initially refusing medication. The . student had originally indicated that she felt a 'traitor to her . convictions' by using drugs to manage her pain, because she believed in . holistic medicine. Injuries: Aimee had her left leg, right foot and both hands amputated. She also lost part of her torso . Much-loved: Aimee's friends and family are praying for her survival and eventual recovery (from left - Aimee, mother Donna, father Andy and sister Paige) She also suffered phantom pains. Mr Copeland wrote: 'Although she has no hands, her brain . is apparently still telling her body that the hands are there. 'I asked . her if she could describe the pain and she told me, ""It feels like I . have been carrying bags of rocks"".' The . University of West Georgia student had to have multiple amputations to save her life . after the small cut to her leg became infected. The bacteria that attacked her wound released a toxin that destroys skin, muscle and a layer . of tissue below the skin known as fascia, her father said. Distraught: Paige Copeland, centre, cried as her parents Donna and Andy spoke about Aimee after she had her leg amputated . Aimee has . improved incredibly rapidly with the support of her family and . well-wishers who have made donations on the website Mr Copeland set up . for his brave daughter. Mr . Copeland wrote that support Aimee has come from all over the US, including from celebrities like Sophia Vergara, Katie Couric and . Ann Curry. Less than a month ago, doctors gave her . little chance of survival, but she became increasingly alert, despite . several major operations, but she is likely to remain hospitalised for several more months. 'This . doctor can't fathom a reason for why she's improved the way she has,' Mr Copeland said. 'Her spirits are extraordinarily high. I am absolutely . amazed.' Necrotizing . fasciitis, more commonly known as 'flesh-eating disease', is a rare but . extremely vicious bacterial infection. 'Necrotizing' refers to . something that causes body tissue to die, and the infection can destroy . skin, muscles and fat. The . disease develops when the bacteria enters the body, often through a . minor cut or scrape. As the bacteria multiply, they release toxins that . kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area. Because it is so virulent, the bacteria spreads rapidly throughout the body. Symptoms . include small, red lumps or bumps on the skin, rapidly-spreading . bruising, sweating, chills, fever and nausea. Organ failure and shock . are also common complications. Sufferers . must be treated immediately to prevent death, and are usually given . powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue. Amputation can . become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg. Patients may undergo skin grafts after the infection has cleared up, to help the healing process or for aesthetic reasons. There are 500 to 1,500 cases reported a year, but 20 to 25 percent of victims die.

A sports teacher who faced life in a wheelchair after a snowboarding accident has defied doctors' dire predictions by learning to walk, run and board again. Mike Siddall, from Bollington in Cheshire, was 23 and an experienced boarder on an instructor’s course in Sass Fee, Switzerland, when he fell and fractured his spine. He was flown to a hospital for a major operation to insert metal bars in his spine, where specialists told him he was completely paralysed and unlikely to ever walk again. Fighting back: Mike Siddall, pictured left after his snowboarding accident and right today, has just competed in the Great Manchester Run despite being left paralysed after a major operation on his spine . 'I’ve spent a lot of time wondering what went wrong but I still don’t know,' said Mr Siddall, now 29. 'It was two days before Christmas on a run I’d done 100 times before. 'But I came off a jump funny and that was it, I just lay there unable to move.' His brother, Dan, walked back up the mountain to help him. Mr Siddall said: 'I realised it was serious when I saw a hand waving in front of me - and didn’t realise it was my own arm and my brother was waving it. 'I couldn’t feel my body and I couldn’t move.' Fearless: Mr Siddall is now back on a snowboard after his devastating ain Switzerland six years ago . Mr Siddal was then flown to a spinal unit in Sheffield on a stretcher for three months of intensive physiotherapy. 'That was horrendous, so scary,' he said. 'On my first day a guy my age in a wheelchair came over and told me not to hope too much, that nobody left there on foot. 'That was hard to hear, especially as doctors couldn’t give me hope either. But I was always trying to wiggle something, I never let myself rest.' Loved: The 29-year-old said family and wife Sarah, pictured, had been incredibly supportive as he slowly regained his ability to move . One day, he finally felt something in his foot, and later his legs - but his upper body remained paralysed. 'Then I managed to move one finger,' said Mr Siddall. 'I got my mum to hold my hand and she felt it. She burst out crying. 'The day I made it all the way across the hall with two physios holding me was incredible.' A year later, he was able to run and he has just completed the Great Manchester Run. In September he will compete in the Great North Run to raise money for Aspire, a spinal injury charity. 'Running wasn’t pretty, in fact it still isn’t. I am still disabled and that’s why I know Aspire is so important for people like me.' Mr Siddall is now back to snowboarding and although he is stiff, has lost dexterity and cannot feel temperatures, he is determined to keep doing all the activities he loved before he was injured. 'When I was in hospital and still in a wheelchair unable to move, a young guy from Aspire came to see me. He was in a wheelchair but so happy and healthy. It was the first time after the accident that I felt it wasn’t the end of the world.' The sports graduate turned to teaching and is now a sports lecturer at Macclesfield College. He says his family and 28-year-old wife Sarah, a reception teacher, were amazing throughout his recovery.

Australia will begin to withdraw troops from Afghanistan this year - 12 months earlier than originally planned, the Prime Minister Julia Gillard said today. She also said she expected all international forces there to be playing a supporting role for Afghan forces by mid-2013. Gillard will take her timetable for Australia's troop withdraw to a NATO conference on Afghanistan in Chicago in May. Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard will take her timetable for Australia's troop withdraw to a NATO conference on Afghanistan in Chicago in May . 'I am now confident that Chicago will recognise mid-2013 as a key milestone in the international strategy,"" she said in a speech to the Australian Strategic Policy Institute in Canberra. 'A crucial point when the international forces will be able to move to a supporting role across all of Afghanistan.' All foreign combat troops are due to be out of Afghanistan by the end of 2014 and Australia had been expected to withdraw then too. U.S. President Barack Obama and other NATO leaders are expected to define more clearly Western withdrawal plans at the Chicago conference and outline measures to ensure Afghanistan does not collapse into civil war when foreign troops go home. Gillard rejected suggestions the faster timetable was being driven by Obama and his desire to have withdrawal plans finalised before the November U.S. presidential election. A major assault in Kabul by the Taliban this week has raised questions about whether Afghan forces will be able to control security after foreign troops withdraw. U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said played down the attacks, which hit including the diplomatic quarter, the parliament and a NATO base. 'These are isolated attacks that are done for symbolic purposes, and they have not regained any territory,' he said. Gillard also said she expected all international forces there to be playing a supporting role for Afghan forces by mid-2013 . A spokesman for NATO's Afghan force, Brigadier General Carsten Jacobson, said its members were drawing up plans for handing over responsibility for security to Afghan forces and Gillard's announcement would be taken into account. 'We are at the stage where all nations are discussing their plans and their role in transition.' 'This will be carefully orchestrated with the government of Australia. This is nothing that is in any way out of what we are all doing.' U.S. forces number about 90,000 of the 130,000-strong NATO-led force. France has 3,600 troops in Afghanistan and Britain 9,500. Australia has about 1,550. Jacobson said 2013 would be decisive for Afghanistan's transition and the aim was for Afghan forces to take over responsibility for security for the entire country by the end of that year. Gillard said she expected President Hamid Karzai to make an announcement on the transition in the coming months, and that it would take twelve to eighteen months to complete the pull-out. Gillard rejected suggestions the faster timetable was being driven by Obama and his desire to have withdrawal plans finalised before the November U.S. presidential election . Australia would argue at the Chicago summit for broad and substantial international support in Afghanistan, Gillard said. 'I will go to Chicago prepared for Australia to pay our fair share. Australia will also be prepared to provide niche training to the Afghan national security forces after 2014,' she said. More than 10 years after the Taliban government was toppled following the 9/11 attacks in 2001, the U.S. administration appears settled on a steady withdrawal of most of its troops by the end of 2014, leaving only a small U.S. force to advise Afghan forces and conduct targeted strikes against militants. French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who is facing a difficult re-election campaign, has announced he would pull French troops out of Afghanistan by the end of 2013. With 32 Australian soldiers killed and hundreds wounded, the Australian government is under mounting pressure to withdraw troops, and faces an expected election next year which Gillard is forecast to lose. A total of 480 British soldiers have been killed since conflict began in 2001 while America has lost 1,827. Gillard said she expected President Hamid Karzai to make an announcement on the transition in the coming months, and that it would take twelve to eighteen months to complete the pull-out .","Julia Gillard to take new timetable to NATO conference in May .

A stunned theatre audience watched a real-life drama unfold on stage after an actor hit his co-star in the face with a kettle forcing the performance to be abandoned. Actress Lizzy Dive, who playing Mrs Twit during a production of Roald Dahl's novel The Twits, had to be taken to the hospital after the mock fight scene went wrong - 10 minutes before the end of the show. She was accidentally struck in the face by a kettle, hurled by her onstage husband Mr Twit, after he dodged the frying pan she was wielding. Real-life drama: The characters Mr and Mrs Twit during their performance at the Minack Theatre, Cornwall. On Friday night Mr Twit accidentally hit Mrs Twit in the face with a kettle . The blunder was played out in front of hundreds at the Minack Theatre, in Penzance, Cornwall, who never got to see how the show ended. One crowed member, who did not want to be named said: 'We very much enjoyed The Twits and despite the weather it was very funny and everything was going to plan. 'But we couldn’t believe what happened in the final closing scenes - it looked incredibly painful and the whole audience, including us, were quite worried about Mrs Twit. 'I hope she is okay now, but it was quite a bad incident. After the show I had to go home and read the rest of the book to know how it ended.' The slapstick mishap happened during a performance of The Twits by open air theatre company Illyria inside the Minack Theatre on Friday.

Mrs Dive was smashed in the face with the metal kettle during a fighting scene in the last ten minutes of the 8pm performance. She was taken to nearby West Cornwall Hospital but was later released with bruising to her face. The remaining part of the show had to be abandoned following the incident.

'There was no show scheduled for yesterday so they were both able to get a bit of a rest. 'And at present both are putting up the stage for this afternoon’s performance near Woking.

Emergency treatment: Health Secretary Andrew Lansley has drafted in a crisis team to deal with problems at South London NHS Trust . Another 20 debt-laden NHS trusts could be put under special measures, it emerged today, after a crisis team took control of three London hospitals. A squad of doctors, accountants and administrators was parachuted into South London Healthcare NHS Trust on the orders of Health Secretary Andrew Lansley after racking up debts of £1million a week. It was the first time in NHS history that a trust has been forced hand over its administration powers to the Department of Health after failing to meet prescribed standards. But today it emerged that the crisis could run far deeper than just one trust as it emerged there are 20 more that have been identified as 'clinically and financially unsustainable'. They have been set goals by the Department of Health to perform better but ultimately, if they do not achieve the results, they could also face being put in special measures. While all are in dire financial straights, many have also been told to clean up a string of performance issues which range from some of the longest waiting times in the country to alarmingly high death rates among patients. They include Surrey and Sussex Healthcare Trust, Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals Trust and Hinchingbrooke Trust, whose hospital in Cambridgeshire had historic debts of more than £40 million and became the first to be taken over in February by a private firm. Barking, Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals Trust and North Cumbria University Hospital Trust are also under the spotlight. They were among seven trusts handed a £1.5 million bailout to ease their debts earlier this year. If any do find themselves in the place of beleaguered South London Trust, the cost to the Government could run to many billions of pounds. Scroll down for video . In trouble: The Hinchingbrooke Hospital in Cambridgeshire Hinchingbrooke Trust had historic debts of more that £40 million .

Suffolk Mental Health Partnership Trust . The financial chaos has already hit . patient care at the hospitals – Queen Mary’s in Sidcup, Queen Elizabeth . in Woolwich and the Princess Royal University Hospital in Bromley. While services have improved in recent months, patients still face some of the longest waits for operations in the country. One in six patients waited longer than the 18-week Government target – the worst figure for any NHS trust in London. It . also performs poorly on casualty unit waiting times, ranking 20th out . of 23 trusts in the capital. Some departments and wards face closure. The Trust took on a large debt when it was formed - mainly from the PFI that had been used for building at the Princess Royal and Queen Elizabeth hospitals. Mr . Lansley has activated an ‘unsustainable providers regime’, putting the . trust under the control of a special administrator with powers to demand . rapid changes. The Health . Secretary stepped in after draft financial plans showed the trust would . have a deficit of £30-£75million a year for the next five years. In . his letter to the trust, he wrote: ‘South London Healthcare NHS Trust . faces deep and longstanding challenges, some of which are not of its own . making. 'Nonetheless, there must be a point when these problems, however they have arisen, are tackled . 'I . appreciate that any decision to use these powers will be unsettling for . staff, but I want to stress that the powers are being considered now so . that patients in South East London have hospital services that have a . sustainable future.  This will benefit patients and bring more certainty . to staff, the public and other local stakeholders. 'I . am determined to improve healthcare services for patients in South East . London and will take whatever difficult steps are necessary to achieve . this.' A Department of . Health source said Mr Lansley was not prepared to run the risk of a . repeat of the Mid Staffordshire scandal in which poor quality care and . mismanagement led to the needless deaths of hundreds of patients. Stephen . Powell, chairman of the Health Select Committee, told Radio 4's Today . programme that there was clearly a need for change in the face of such . enormous losses. Queen Mary's Hospital, Sidcup: A squad of doctors, accountants and administrators was parachuted into South London Healthcare NHS Trust after running up debts of £1million a week . He said there was an 'over-dependence . on hospitals' and that one focus of the restructuring may be improving . 'care in the community'. The . move means that, unlike loss-making companies in the private sector, . the Trust will not have to pay back the money it has lost. Mr . Powell added: 'Politicians are responsible but the Secretary of State . can't make all the decisions. There is a need for change.' An administrator could now be brought in and the Trust could go bust, leading to it being dissolved and some services closed. Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Woolwich: South London Healthcare NHS Trust's three hospitals will cost £2.5billion under the long-term construction and management scheme . The Department of Health said in a statement: 'The hospitals in this Trust have faced multiple problems for many years, which the previous Labour Government made worse by a merger, and the approval of two huge PFI deals that have further destabilised the Trust. The trust lost over £1 million a week last year, enough to pay for 1000 cataract operations per week, 200 hip replacements per week, or pay the salaries of 1200 nurses. 'The unsustainable providers regime was created by Labour’s Andy Burnham when he was Health Secretary. However, Labour never made use of them, preferring instead to sweep the  problems facing some parts of the NHS under the carpet. Princess Royal University Hospital, Bromley: One in six patients waited longer than the 18-week Government target - the worst figure for any NHS trust in London . 'South London Healthcare NHS Trust is an exceptional case, showing most of the problems which are characteristic of “challenged” NHS Trusts. There are about two dozen sucg Trusts where the Government inherited serious longstanding problems. 'Andrew Lansley’s decision will send a strong signal to unsustainable NHS organisations that they cannot continue to provide poor services or rely on bailouts from other parts of the NHS. 'All the hospitals deemed to be unsustainable have signed agreements with the Department of Health to turn their performance around, and it is possible that the Government will consider putting some of them or others who cannot deliver sustainable services into special measures if their leadership does not make progress fast enough. 'South London Healthcare NHS Trust has . previously owned up to multiple challenges including not being efficient . enough, delivering low quality services, having poor contracting . arrangements and having a weak board. Like the many other hospitals yet . to become part of the elite NHS Foundation Trusts, the Trust faces . problems which – according to the National Audit Office - ""have lain . unresolved for a number of years"".' Chris Ham, chief executive of health . think tank the Kings Fund, warned on Radio 4's Today programme . that not only other . NHS Trusts, but potentially even Foundation Trusts at the very top, could go . through the same thing. He . said it was important to face up to the problems, and that administrators would be able to restructure.","Department of Health has identified the 20 as 'clinically and financially unsustainable'

Parents should get a job rather than rely on handout if they want to lift their children out of poverty, Iain Duncan Smith will declare today. The Work and Pensions Secretary will insist that employment, not a few extra pounds in welfare benefits, is the key to lifting families out of poverty, as he unveils plans to replace all other out of work benefits from 2013, with the Coalition’s new universal credit. Mr Duncan Smith claims the reform will remove incentives to stay on welfare rather than moving into work. New targets: Iain Duncan Smith . Mr Duncan Smith will also announce . plans to tear up the method of measuring child poverty by family . income, introduced under Labour, insisting that determining children’s . wellbeing simply on the basis of income can be perverse. He will claim that research shows that giving money could in fact do more . harm than good, for example by fuelling drug addiction or removing the . incentive to find employment. ‘Our latest analysis suggests that . universal credit will ensure the vast majority of children will be . lifted out of poverty if at least one parent works 35 hours a week at . the minimum wage – or 24 hours if they are a lone parent,’ he will say . today.

The last government’s measure of . poverty – children living in households with an income below 60 per cent . of median earnings – was enshrined in law. Definitions of child poverty, introduced under the last Labour government, look set to be amended in the shake-up . Mr Duncan Smith will announce that the . Government is to scrap the measure and consult on broader ways of . calculating children’s life chances. These could include whether their . parents are in employment, drug and alcohol addiction in the home, . family debts, truancy rates and other factors. The move will prompt outrage from . Labour, which will accuse the Government of deliberately changing the . goalposts to mask the impact of its austerity policies. But the Work and Pensions Secretary . will deride his predecessor’s approach of supposedly tackling poverty by . boosting income just over an arbitrary line and declaring that a . child’s life chances have thereby been transformed. ‘The last government spoke about the . need to tackle poverty, and poured vast amounts of money into the . pursuit of this ambition,’ he will say in a speech. ‘£150 billion was spent on tax credits . alone between 2004 and 2010. Overall, the welfare bill increased by . some 40 per cent in real terms, even in a decade of rising growth and . rising employment. ‘Yet for all the extra money, the earlier and easier successes were followed by flatlining results. ‘The Institute for Fiscal Studies has . been clear that the previous government are likely to have missed their . target to halve child poverty by 2010.’ Labour's work and pensions spokesman Liam Byrne said that behind Cameron's proposals were an abandonment of parents and children . Mr Duncan Smith will dismiss the . ‘overwhelming’ focus on family income, adding: ‘If a family has less . than 60 per cent of the median income it is said to be poor, if it has . 60 per cent or more it is not. ‘By this narrow measure, if you have a . family who sit one pound below the poverty line you can do a magical . thing. Give them one pound more, say through increased benefit payments, . and you can apparently change everything – you are said to have pulled . them out of poverty. ‘Of course money is important and will . always play a part in future measurements of poverty. But increased . income from welfare transfers is temporary if nothing changes. ‘Just take the example of a poor . family where the parents are suffering from a drug addiction. Giving the . parents extra money moves them over the line and out of “poverty” on . paper. ‘Yet because much of the money will . almost certainly go on drugs, the family still lives in poverty. Coming . off drugs is therefore a vital step for them getting out of poverty. ‘Or take a family where no one has . ever worked. Simply increasing the household’s income – while taking no . other proactive action – will only push the family further into . dependency and weaken the incentive to take up work.’ Mr Duncan Smith will argue that for . some, including people with severe disabilities, income from the state . will always play a vital role. The Coalition’s new universal credit, . which will replace all other out of work benefits from 2013, will remove . incentives to stay on welfare rather than moving into work. Labour’s work and pensions spokesman . Liam Byrne said: ‘In a great country like Britain we should stand behind . parents fighting to bring up their children free of the curse of . poverty. ‘Behind Cameron’s promises we learn . today that those parents and their children will now be abandoned and . told, “you are on your own”.’","Majority of children lifted out of poverty if one parent works 35 hours a week at .

The estranged husband of a woman who went missing on Friday is travelling home from Afghanistan, where he is on active duty as a Marine, to help look for his wife. The disappearance of Brittany Killgore, 22, from Fallbrook, California, comes just days after she filed for a divorce from her husband of two years, Cory Killgore, 22. Police believe another Marine, 45-year-old Louis Ray Perez, may have been the last person to see Killgore alive and said they suspect foul play after he was 'uncooperative' during their questioning. Scroll down for video . Missing: Brittany Killgore was last seen on Friday with a marine who was later arrested on an unrelated charge .

Ms Killgore was last seen wearing a dark purple evening gown, with purple floral glitter patterns. She is 5 ft 7 inches, 130 pounds with brown hair and brown eyes, according to the Sheriff’s department.

A gangland gunman who paralysed a five-year-old girl when he botched a hit on a rival was jailed for life today. Nathaniel Grant, 21, was told he will spend at least 17 years behind bars for a shooting that shocked Britain and was described by a judge as an 'attack on society itself'. He fired the bullet into a shop in Stockwell, south London that left innocent Thusha Kamaleswaran confined to a wheelchair and turned her family's world upside down. Scroll down for video (warning: distressing footage) Crippled: Thusha Kamaleswaren, right, at home with her brother Thusan, 13. She was shot by gangsters - and left paralysed - as she played in her uncle's shop in Stockwell, south London . Help: Thusha, now nine, is pushed on a special bike by her family, whose lives have been turned upside down . His two accomplices, 'sidekick' Anthony McCalla, 20, and 'enforcer' Kazeem Kolawole, 19, were also jailed for life. The trio, who could have been behind bars on the day they shot Thusha, were members of Brixton's Gas - or Guns And Shanks - Gang, responsible for a trail of violence that has devastated parts of South London. Judge Martin Stephens QC said all of the men pose a high risk to the public and none of them has shown a 'shred of remorse.' He said: 'This is an exceptional case of the utmost gravity. The seriousness is such that a life sentence is necessary to reflect public abhorrence of these offences. 'Shooting twice into the small and confined shop where it was known there were people present can be denounced as an attack on society itself by men who saw themselves as outside and above the law.' Kazeen and McCalla, who showed no response to their sentences, were told they will serve a minimum of 14 years. Behind bars: From left, Nathaniel Grant, 21, was jailed for 17 years, while his accomplices  Kazeem Kolawole, 19, and Anthony McCalla, 20, were both handed 14-year sentences at the Old Bailey in London today . Thusha’s family reacted with fury to the sentences – as all three men could be freed when they are still in their thirties. Shopkeeper Vicknes Mahadevan, who witnessed his niece’s shooting, said: ‘It’s easy time isn’t it? They will all come out when they are still young men. Even though they took a gun and shot somebody. ‘They have still got lives to live. My family must live with this forever, not just for a number of years. When Thusha is in her thirties will these people still be thinking about her? I doubt it. It is terrible. We will never get over what has happened.’ It was previously revealed that the three men could - and perhaps should - already have . been locked up. Grant, known as ‘Killa Buzz’, was cleared of an almost identical gangland murder and released from prison just weeks earlier; . McCalla was on bail over a vicious bus brawl and probation . staff considered recalling him to prison hours before Thusha was shot; . Judge Martin Stephens QC . Kolawole had recently been spared prison for beating a . schoolgirl and was wearing an electronic tag while on bail for carrying a . knife. Earlier this week Thusha's family moved into a new home that has been refurbished to meet her needs. Police officers were so moved by the family's plight that they have already raised £125,000 to go towards her care. Kolawole, of Kennington, south . east London; McCalla, of Streatham, south London; and Grant, of . Camberwell, south east London, were told their crimes were ‘of the . utmost gravity’. Judge Martin Stephens QC said: ‘Much . of what you did was captured on CCTV and has been shown on television . screens across the land. ‘One can only imagine the effect on the public when they saw what you had done.’ He said the trio had gone out with a ‘determined, premeditated intention to kill’ that day. Judge Stephens continued: ‘Mr Selvakumar was hit in the head but miraculously survived with a piece of bullet remaining in his head. Harrowing: CCTV from inside Stockwell Food and Wine shows lying on the floor having been shot in the chest . ‘Five-year-old Thusha, who was dancing around with her family in the shop, was hit in the body. 'Only . the skill and devotion of the medical teams who became involved saved . her life but she remains paralysed below her chest and this condition is . permanent. ‘This . simple but devastating statement of the essential facts of the case . illustrate the gravity of these offences, riddled as they are with . aggravating factors.’ Judge Stephens told the trio: ‘Not one of you has, in my judgment, shown a sliver of remorse.’ Grant has previous convictions for . robbery and possession of an offensive weapon, Kolawole for affray, and . McCalla for robbery, affray, possessing an offensive weapon with intent . and violent disorder. The judge said they posed ‘a significant risk to members of the public of serious harm in the future’. He said: ‘You, Grant, were the gunman . and the other two your fully supportive lieutenants backing up all your . actions to the hilt and giving you the support and encouragement to . carry out these terrible deeds.

Happy: Thusha before the tragedy . ‘Shooting . into a shop, a confined space where it was known there were people . present, is an attack on society itself by men who saw themselves as . outside the law and above the law.’ Judge . Stephens said the convictions would not have been possible without . CCTV, and that he hoped Thusha could go on to lead as full a life as . possible. The trio . cycled up to Stockwell Food and Wine on March 29 last year and Grant . opened fire into the shop, hitting Mr Selvakumar and Thusha. Jurors were told he would have been able to see the girl as he fired his second shot. The three men were members of the . Brixton-based OC (Organised Criminals) gang, and were on the hunt for a . member of their bitter rivals ABM (All Bout Money). Thusha was hit in the chest and the bullet passed through the seventh vertebra of her spine. She went into cardiac arrest twice and . had to undergo emergency surgery in the shop and at hospital, and is . now permanently paralysed. Mr Selvakumar has bullet fragments lodged in his head that cannot safely be removed.After the verdicts last month, Thusha, now six, told the Daily Mail: ‘I worry that someone will try to hurt me again.’ Her family has been left battling debt and mother Sharmila Kamaleswaran is said to have suffered insomnia and depression. She said in a victim impact statement that seeing her daughter, who dreamed of being a dancer, in a hospital bed ‘took my heart away’. Outside court, Detective Superintendent Gordon Allison said the only time the gunmen had apologised was when they wanted to reduce their prison sentences. ‘They have been sentenced to life imprisonment for these offences and hopefully they will have time to reflect on their crimes,’ he said.","Gunman Nathanial Grant, 21, jailed for 17 years while 'sidekick' Anthony McCalla, 20, and 'enforcer' Kazeem Kolawole, 19, got 14 years .

She can be heard laughing down the phone as she points out the awkward body language between Edwards and his wife - who had terminal cancer. 'The have footage of it on ABC News .

The video that Hunter was referring to, shown above, was captured from a helicopter who spotted Mr Obama, who was the front-runner in the Democratic race, making a private visit to the Edwards' North Carolina home after a meeting with the Senator. In the short clip, it shows Mr Obama leaving their house, shaking Edwards' hand and giving him a hug before riding off in his black SUV. Once Mr Obama leaves, Edwards and Elizabeth walk back into the home standing several feet apart from one another. Then and now: Rielle Hunter appeared on Extra in 2008 (left) and was seen more recently with her daughter Quinn (right) who she had with John Edwards . The voicemail messages come on day four of the Democrat's corruption trial and was one of about 13 between Edwards, Young, and Hunter that the prosecution put into the record of evidence. A number of the other voicemails consist of Edwards calling Young and 'checking in'. At the time, Young and his family were travelling with the pregnant Hunter, after Young initially claimed the paternity in order to keep the heat off of Edwards. In several of the messages, Edwards makes mention of his wife being in his presence, effectively stifling what he really wants to say. The prosecution also put pictures of the expensive hotels where the Youngs and Hunter stayed during this trip, allegedly on the campaign's dime. John Edwards' defense lawyer on Thursday picked apart ex-aide Andrew Young's story that he was asked to conceal Edwards' affair with a mistress with campaign money, accusing him of making up stories about the former presidential contender to make money off of the scandal. Letter from donor: This handwritten note from 'Bunny' Mellon shows her lamenting over the fact that the press skewered Edwards' $400 haircuts, and she said that she would take care of bills . Payments: Ms Mellon would write that her donations were for expensive furniture, like the Table this $10,000 check was for, rather than the alleged payments to hide Hunter . Andrew Young took the witness stand for a fourth straight day at Edwards' campaign finance fraud trial. The star prosecution witness is key to the government's case that while campaigning for the White House in 2008, Edwards directed a scheme to use nearly $1million in secret payments from two wealthy donors to conceal an affair with his pregnant mistress. Edwards has pleaded not guilty to six criminal counts and faces up to 30 years behind bars if convicted. The defence argued in opening statements that Young spent most of the money at issue in the case to build a $1.5million house for his family, not to buy the silence of Edwards' mistress, Rielle Hunter. The defence sought to undermine Young's credibility and paint him as a pathological liar. Defence . lawyer Abbe Lowell pointed out inconsistencies with Young's account of . the scandal at trial this week and in multiple other accounts, including . grand jury testimony and his 2010 tell-all book about Edwards. Repeatedly, . Lowell accused Young of lying. Referring to the timing of a . conversation with a law partner of Edwards, Lowell asked, ‘And you made . that up too, didn't you?’ Conflicting stories: John Edwards (left) and his former aide Andrew Young (left) are detailing the 2008 affair . Troubles: Andrew Young told the court yesterday that John Edwards described life with Elizabeth as a 'living hell' after she found out about the affair . December 14, 2007John Edwards to Andrew Young'Uh, if that's, if I'm calling saying what happened, how did this happen, what's goin' on, then that's because Elizabeth's standing there with me. 'Cause I have to, I think I've gotta tell her about this because it's moving.' December 27John Edwards to Andrew Young'I'm just checkin' in with you and, and makin' sure you're safe and, and in a place where you're good and you can just call me back . January 8, 2008John Edwards to Andrew Young'Uh, just wanted for all of you, including her, to know that I am thinking about you.' January 10, 2008Fred Baron to Andrew Young'(Edwards) wants you to know that he's not taking your call or her call right now because of, uh, his circumstances with, uh, the EE, and not to take it personally, but it'll get better soon. But right now he's in a bad place. So, don't get your feelings hurt if your calls are not being returned or her calls are not being returned.' February 17, 2008 Rielle Hunter to Andrew Young 'They have footage of it on ABC News World News tonight, Obama leaving the house shaking his hand, um, and Elizabeth, and, and, Johnny and Elizabeth couldn't be further apart from each other (laughter). I mean, on either side, like of the driveway. So, so, yea, interesting.' ‘No, sir,’ Young responded. Lowell asked Young whether he first learned Hunter, was pregnant in May 2007, as his book says: in June 2007, as he testified; or in early July, a date backed by phone records and Hunter's medical records. The timeline issues could challenge the accounts of conversations Young said he had with Edwards in a car discussing who to ask for money to help take care of Hunter and discussing Hunter's pregnancy. Young said he couldn't recall the exact date for either event. Lowell also challenged Young on which amount of secret money a wealthy heiress said she would provide to help make Edwards president - $1.2million, as he testified this week, or $900,000 and $925,000, figures he had previously given. Young said the number he provided this week is the correct one. Young . had falsely claimed paternity of Edwards' daughter, Frances Quinn . Hunter, while Edwards was campaigning for president. Edwards . acknowledged he had fathered the child two years later. As . Lowell's detailed questioning continued, some jurors appeared . distracted and even U.S. District Court Judge Catherine C. Eagles grew . impatient. ‘I'm not quite . following,’ the judge told Lowell after he asked Young a question about . whose idea it was for Young to claim paternity of Hunter's child. ‘We're . about to beat a dead horse here.’ She warned the attorney she might cut off his questions if they weren't relevant to the criminal charges facing Edwards. ‘You're going to get to the money, right?’ she asked Lowell. Young was expected to remain on the stand throughout all of Thursday. His wife, Cheri Young, could take the stand on Friday.

It is a record collection so prized that even the British Museum considered housing it to preserve for future generations. Now for the first time the public will be able to peruse famed Radio 1 DJ John Peel’s unique record collection. In a new venture by the BBC and the Arts Council a dedicated culture channel will broadcast on Freeview and through a special website. Legend: John Peel at Peel Acres his Suffolk home before his death in 2004, pictured in front of just a small sample of his huge record collection . One of the biggest draws of the project - entitled The Space – is that it will feature a virtual recreation of the late broadcaster’s home studio and library. Fans will be able to click on a link that takes them into his studio and to flick through his record collection, radio sessions and view unseen documentary footage. Peel’s widow Sheila Ravenscroft and the John Peel Centre for Creative Arts have put the project together. In a video clip for the site, she said: ‘John’s record collection is one of the most important in the world. Recreation: DJ John Peel's studio where he chose some of the records he tipped for the top . ‘The Space project is allowing people to have a small insight into what is there. Hopefully people are going to really enjoy having a little bit of John’s collection.’ Yesterday the first 100 albums from his collection were made available for fans to rifle through. Each week from now until October a further 100 will be released in alphabetical order of the artist. Over six months, 2,600 albums will be unveiled from his collection – and there have already been a few surprises. Peel is best loved for championing new, unusual or little known artists and transforming them into stars but his collection includes pop favourites such as Abba, A-Ha and Adam and The Ants. Users can then click on the record and see Peel’s meticulously typed files detailing artist, title and tracks. DJ John Peel spent a life surrounded by records and was BBC Radio 1's longest serving original presenter . Copyright laws mean that the music cannot be streamed or downloaded from the site but links are included, if they are available, where users can click through to sites where you can buy or listen to music legally such as Spotify, SoundCloud and iTunes. Mrs Ravenscroft said that the contents of each batch of records would be a closely guarded secret until they were uploaded but hinted fans would be “intrigued and amused”. She added: ‘Each week we are choosing the first hundred of each letter of the alphabet and giving some information on what is there, what John particularly starred and his favourite tracks. ‘Within that there will be one artist that we particularly feature.’ In addition to his records, music lovers will also be able to listen to vintage sessions and browse photographs that span his forty year career in broadcasting. * Peel owned 25,000 LPs, 40,000 singles, and thousands of CDs . * The British Library expressed an . interest in housing his record collection because of its range and . cultural value, after his death . * 'Teenage dreams so hard to beat' from his favourite Undertone’s song Teenage Kicks, is etched on his tombstone . * Peel’s own meticulous cataloguing . helped fuel the idea for the 'online museum' as he made a filing card . for every album detailing the title, the band’s name and the tracks on . it . * He began the collection in 1969 and added to it every year until his death in 2004 . * The first album in his virtual studio . is folk singer Mike Absalom 1968’s Save the Last Gherkin for Me - number . 00001 in Peel’s catalogue system . * He also had a more exclusive “record . box” which had 142 records of his essential music including work by Marc . Bolan, The Beatles, The White Stripes, and Laurie Anderson . There is also previously unseen documentary material and Peel’s own videos, including footage of him at home in Suffolk, travelling in Europe and at his beloved Liverpool’s Anfield stadium. Hundreds took to social networks such as Twitter and Facebook to tell of their excitement to have access or see the catalogue. One fan said: ‘This could actually be years of musical inspiration. Brilliant.’ Peel was hugely popular and was Radio 1’s longest serving DJ when he died, aged 65, in October 2004. He became one of the first DJs to give exposure to punk and hip-hop, and among the bands whose fortunes he helped transform in Britain are Pulp, The Smiths, and Nirvana. His Peel Sessions programme built up international acclaim and he could also be heard on the BBC’s World Service. He had a heart attack while on a working holiday with his wife in Peru. He had been married to Sheila for 30 years and had four children William, Alexandra, Tom, and Florence. The Space has a dedicated website and will broadcast on Freeview channel 117 as part of a six month pilot project.The Arts Council has invested £3.5 million in the project while the BBC is providing technological and digital archive expertise. Other projects that will feature on the site include a first film season from the British Film Institute. It will screen the debut movies of such acclaimed directors as Ridley Scott, Stephen Frears and Ken Russell. In addition, the BFI screen through The Space two re-mastered silent films by Alfred Hitchcock. The acclaimed director had such success with his later works such as Psycho, Vertigo, M for Murder and The Birds, that his silent work is often forgotten. But the arts channel will show 1927 drama The Ring, which follows a tangled love triangle set against the backdrop of boxing, and 1928 film Champagne about a young women forced into work after her father claims they are destitute. Performances from Sadler’s Wells, exhibitions and live events from The Serpentine, and a new season of all 37 of Shakespeare’s plays from the Globe Theatre, are among the other items lined up. Alan Davies, chief executive of Arts Council England, said: ‘Today The space opens a new door into the cultural universe – one that offers a glimpse of a future where people can explore the arts whenever they want and wherever they are.’ To access John Peel’s collection and other arts projects visit www.thespace.org.","John Peel's widow working with the BBC and the Arts Council following the long-serving DJ's death in 2004 .

'It can sometimes be difficult to tell if your child is overweight as they may look similar to other children their age.

For 63 years Rex Coxeter had cherished his beloved pet Timmy the tortoise  – until thieves stole the endangered reptile from the family home. The grandfather-of-seven, 73 - who has had the Hermann’s tortoise since he was an 11-year-old boy – came home from a short break to discover the treasured creature had been snatched, last month. Retired mushroom grower Mr Coxeter has now launched an appeal for his safe return, warning Timmy could die without him - because no one else knows his ‘funny ways’. Beloved: Rex Coxeter has pleaded for the return of family pet Timmy - stolen from his home in Dunmow, Essex, last month - who he had cherished since he was 10-year-old boy, left, .

He will never survive with other people as they . will not know his funny ways. ‘He is probably worth thousands of pounds - but it is not about the money. ‘I . want to know what happened to him.

I look back, I just think my goodness - when I first had him there were . no motorways, all the railways were steam and the Queen wasn’t even on . the throne. ‘It makes you realise just how old he is.’ It . is believed the endangered animal - which could be worth thousands of . pounds - was snatched by opportunistic metal thieves as they scoured the . area for property to steal. Neighbours . spotted a scrap metal truck, with white goods loaded in the back, . pulling up at the family’s home in Dunmow, Essex, on April 23, just . hours after the couple left for their weekend away. Retired mushroom grower Rex also warned the thieves would struggle to sell the distinctive 10lbs (4.5kg) reptile because animal dealers will spot how rare it is. Heartbroken: Rex Coxeter is offering a considerable cast reward for the return of the rare and valuable tortoise, which has been in the same family for 63 years . The father-of-three said: ‘I knew he was gone as soon as I got back. He’s kept in a large area, and it’s like having a cow in a field – you instantly notice if they’ve gone missing. Rex realised his precious tortoise was missing when he returned from holiday on May 2. Neighbours spotted an open-sided scrap metal truck pulling up on his land between noon and 2pm and an intruder prowling around his back garden. The police have been informed and Rex has also alerted the National Theft Register - an agency that helps find stolen exotic animals. It is hoped the underside of Timmy’s shell, which is the equivalent of a human fingerprint and unique to each individual tortoise, will help police identify the pet. John Hayward, from the national theft register, said there has been a recent spate of tortoise snatchings across the south east but believed Timmy’s theft was opportunistic. He said: ‘The tortoise is extremely old and rare. It is on the most endangered list. ‘It is so sad. Those who have stolen it will not be providing for its welfare properly. ‘He is obviously sadly missed and the owners have offered a reward for its safe return and the police are anxious for any information leading to the arrest and conviction of the thieves. ‘Anybody who buys or sells these animals must have a licence or face criminal charges.’ Timmy, who came out of his six-month hibernation on March 24, needs a diet of dandelions, fresh grass and water to survive. Hermann’s tortoises are found in the Mediterranean, from southern France to Turkey and in the Balkans and central Mediterranean islands. They have a slightly hooked upper jaw and, like other tortoises, possess no teeth, just a strong, horny beak. Until 1984, when the UK introduced an import ban, tortoises were regularly shipped from Mediterranean countries under cruel and cramped conditions.","Rex Coxeter, 73, was a ten-year-old boy when he was given Timmy the tortoise .

It has the softer skin and texture of a pear, but anyone who bites into this fruit in for a surprise. New Zealand fruit experts have unveiled their latest fruit hybrid creation on its way to the UK - an apple-like fruit which looks like a pear. The rounded fleshy fruit described as a pear disguised as an apple has yet to be given an official name, though some have inevitably dubbed the creation the 'papple'. Apple in disguise: The 'papple' has to softer appearance of a pear, but apparently tastes like an apple . Marks and Spencer say the New Zealand-grown papples will go on sale for £1 each . The papple, which is officially a member of the pear family, will go on sale in the UK next week at Marks and Spencer. Fruit buyers used to the price of apples and pears may baulk at the value of papples however, as the novelty products will cost £1 each when they hit the shelves. The papple is the latest hybrid fruit creation to hit British supermarkets. Last year garden centres took stock of the 'pineberry' - a white strawberry-like fruit said to have the tropical taste of a pineapple. And earlier last year a Washington-based fruit grower unveiled the 'grapple', a fruit which looked and crunched like a regular apple, but tasted like a grape. The phenonenom for fruit tampering has even spread further afield, with Israeli horticulturalists creating a 'black galaxy' crossbreed of tomato which had almost-black skin. The papple is being referred to as T109 until its official name is decided, a spokeswoman said. M&S fruit expert Shazad Rehman said: 'This is one of the most exciting new varieties of fruit we have seen for several years. 'We know our customers like to try new and interesting fruit and we hope this will be something they will really enjoy.' T109 is grown in New Zealand and is a cross between European and Asian pear varieties, which resulted in a fruit similar to an apple, the retailer said. Mr Rehman said: 'It’s got a lovely refreshing taste, perfect for snacking on, and a fun alternative to an apple a day.' M&S hopes to grow the pear in the UK from 2015.","Hybrid fruit tastes like an apple but has skin and texture of a pear .

The woman at the centre of a 'too fat to fly' controversy has announced that she is suing Southwest Airlines, which refused to allow her on a flight because of her size. New Orleans resident Kenlie Tiggeman is taking on the airlines controversial 'Customers of Size' policy which requires passengers to buy a second seat if they can't fit between the 17-inch wide armrests. In her quest to seek an injunction against the Dallas-headquartered carrier, Ms Tiggeman alleges that Southwest ignored her 'constitutional rights' and demonstrates 'discriminatory actions towards obese customers'. Scroll down for video . Too fat to fly? Kenlie Tiggeman is suing Southwest Airlines after being told she was too large to have only one seat for the second time in six months . Conflict: Ms Tiggeman, left, now 120lbs lighter, was on a layover with her mother, Joan Charpentier, right, when they said they were singled out by an official in front of some 100 other passengers because of their size . Should airline passengers be required to buy a second seat if they can't fit between 17-inch wide armrests? While she is not seeking monetary damages from the airline, Ms Tiggeman has claimed that she wants to enact an industry wide standard for rules to be put in place clearly stating the official policy of all U.S air companies. 'We need to know what the rules are,' she said. 'We need to know if we need one seat or two, because this eyeballing happening at the gate is incredibly discriminatory, and it's so unnecessary.' Ms Tiggeman rose to national . prominence last year when a Southwest Airlines employee declared that . she was 'too fat to fly,' and asked her to buy a second seat. Before and after: Ms Tiggeman, seen before she took her first flight in April 2011, and weighing around 300lbs, left, and a more recent photo, after she lost around 120 pounds, right . Making progress: Tiggeman, pictured after significant weight loss in New York's Times Square, wrote on her blog: 'Some days are easy, and some are a struggle' The political strategist, along with her mother, Joan Charpentier, were on a layover in Dallas . when they said they were singled out by an official in front of some 100 . other passengers because of their size. 'The gate agent came up to me and he asked me how much I weighed, what size clothes I wore,' Ms Tiggeman told ABC News. 'He said that I was too fat to fly, that I would need an additional seat, and he was really sort of crass about the whole thing.' She added: 'There was no privacy.' Weigh in: Southwest says any passenger who cannot fit comfortably in their 17-inch seats with both armrests down must purchase another seat . Policy: More than 90 per cent of the time, 'customers of size' receive a refund for their second seat, a Southwest spokesperson said . At the time, Ms Tiggeman said she weighed between 240 and 300 pounds. She said the agent 'didn't know what the policy was,' so a supervisor was brought in to assess the situation. According to Southwest’s website, the definitive gauge for a Customer of Size is fairly simple – the armrest. ‘It serves as the boundary between seats, which measure 17 inches wide. Customers who are unable to lower both armrests and/or who encroach upon any portion of the adjacent seat should proactively book the number of seats needed prior to travel.’ Southwest requested that its employees use sensitivity when addressing customers of size, noting it’s difficult to hold a private conversation in a crowded airport. The airline encourages passengers to proactively purchase additional seats, the website reads, in order to avoid ‘embarrassing conversations.’ The airline said that in 98 per cent of cases, the customer of size may obtain a refund because the flight is not full. Source: Southwest Airlines . However, the supervisor was unaware of the airline's policy as well, Ms Tiggeman said. Following the incident, which Tiggeman blogged about on her website alltheweigh.com, a Southwest executive apologised, refunded her ticket, and offered flight vouchers. Flying on the same airline twice more Tiggeman suffered no more embarrassments until Thanksgiving last year when she had to go through a similar experience. 'Something has to change. I just need some consistency,' said Tiggeman to WDSU.com. Responding to the impending law-suit, a spokesman for Southwest Airlines offered some advice. 'The best case scenario is for the customer to notify us of any special needs ahead of time,' said Brandy King. 'If providing the additional seat does not result in our having to deny another customer boarding, we will refund the ticket to the customer at no charge, which happens more than 90 percent of the time.' In fact, the airline said on their website that in 98 per cent of cases, the customer of size may obtain a refund because the flight is not full. Struggle: For Ms Tiggeman, pictured three years ago when she weighed 400lbs, the two incidents with Southwest Airlines were hurtful after she battled hard to lose weight . Motivation: A picture taken from Kenlie Tiggeman's blog alltheweigh.com which helped convince her that she needed to lose weight . Wide load? Director Kevin Smith was famously asked to leave a 2010 Southwest flight . In February 2010, director Kevin Smith famously was told he was ‘too wide for the sky.’ According to his Twitter feed, he was removed from the Southwest flight because he was deemed a safety risk. The Jay and Silent Bob director was given a $100 voucher by the airline and boarded another flight. Southwest later reached out to apologise. The airline also booted a thin flier from one of their seats in July of 2010 on a Las Vegas-to-Sacramento flight so an obese 14-year-old could have her seat. ‘It didn’t seem right that I should have to leave to accommodate someone who had only paid for one seat,’ she told the Sacramento Bee at the time. A Southwest spokesperson later told the Bee: ‘We know this was awkward and we should have handled it better.’ The airline later apologised to the woman. At the time of the incident, . Southwest said they clearly stated in their ‘Customers of Size’ policy . that passengers who cannot fit within the 17-inch armrests must purchase . an additional seat. According to Southwest’s website, the . definitive gauge for a Customer of Size is fairly simple – the armrest. ‘It serves as the boundary between seats, which measure 17 inches wide. 'Customers who are unable to lower . both armrests and/or who encroach upon any portion of the adjacent seat . should proactively book the number of seats needed prior to travel.’ Southwest requested that its . employees use sensitivity when addressing customers of size, noting it’s . difficult to hold a private conversation in a crowded airport. The airline encourages passengers to . proactively purchase additional seats, the website reads, in order to . avoid ‘embarrassing conversations.’ While Tiggeman's crusade continues many passengers feel that they are being attacked by airlines. Spirit Airlines announced this week that passengers might have to pay up to $100 for a carry-on bag, meaning any larger hand luggage could be charged for. However, the issue of size and passengers is clearly still emotive. 'I don't want the person next to me on top of my seat, or coming underneath the armrest because I've paid for my whole seat,' said MeMe Roth, the founder of National Action against Obesity. On the flip-side, Brandon Macsata, a passenger rights spokesman wants greater acceptance shown to overweight people. 'These aren't durable goods being shipped from point A to point B,' said Macsata. 'This isn't cattle being shipped to a livestock farm.' While her suit against Southwest Airlines continues, Tiggeman wants it to be known that she isn't an advocate for obesity. In fact, her blog records her current weight loss which at the moment is over 100 pounds down from what it was in April 2011. 'While we may not be born with an innate privilege of flying on a plane, as paying consumers we do have the right to fly if we’re willing to follow the rules,' said Tiggeman.

Melanie Ruddell spoke for the first time about the death of her two-year-old son Christy via video link from a secure unit where she is being treated for a mental illness. The 40-year-old, of Castle Eden, near Hartlepool, killed her son at her brother’s home in West Rainton, near Durham, before driving his body to Peterlee police station in August 2010. She was later detained under the Mental Health Act after admitting manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. Speaking publicly for the first time about the horrific incident - from a secure unit in Teesside - a tearful Ms Ruddell said: 'I felt anxious and I was frightened for Christy. 'I was confused, very confused. I heard voices and screaming. I couldn’t connect anything with reality. 'I was frightened of friends and family. 'I was scared to a point where it felt as though I was hanging off a cliff. I was exhausted.' The inquest, held at Sunderland Civic Centre, heard Mrs Ruddell’s mental state worsened after the breakdown of her marriage to husband Alan. She told the hearing she had been a ‘happy mam’ at home with Christy and loved him, but felt anxious and frightened for him. After friends and family grew concerned, she went to the A&E department at the University Hospital of Hartlepool for treatment. But after being seen by a doctor, she discharged herself from the unit before a psychiatric assessment as she was in a rush to be reunited with her son, who was with her brother at his home in West Rainton. She said: 'The doctor said he would like me to see the team of people at the hospital. 'I said ""I’ve got to get back to Christy"". I just couldn’t think properly.' She spoke about her return to her brother’s home and said: 'I wanted the police to come and protect us. It was two o’clock in the morning. I thought ""That’s it, we are going to be separated for ever and ever"". 'Everything was hopeless.' Police outside Ruddell's home in the Castle Eden area of Peterlee. She has been living in a secure unit in Teesside since the killing in 2010 . Her friend, Carol-Ann Beeston, also gave evidence at the hearing about how she tried in vain to keep Ms Ruddell at the hospital, knowing she needed professional help. 'She was so deranged at this point,' said Ms Beeston. 'She was talking a load of gobbledygook.' Ms Beeston added: 'She was a really good mother, but that weekend she was very agitated. 'It was as if someone else was in her body. I had never seen her like this. 'She was frightened she might harm herself. I didn’t think she would harm Christy. 'I actually begged them to keep her in. I knew she should be in hospital, not to be going home. 'She wanted to discharge herself. There was nothing they could do.' Mrs Beeston said hospital staff told her there was nowhere to admit her to, so she decided to leave. Pathologist Dr Stuart Hamilton said Christy’s death was caused by strangulation with a dressing gown cord. He said there was also a stab wound to the chest, which was up to 40mm deep, but it had not passed through any vital organs. Sunderland coroner Derek Winter yesterday formally re-opened the inquest into Christy’s death. The hearing, which is being attended by many friends and family of the youngster, is expected to last two weeks. Mrs Ruddell has been receiving treatment for her illness since Mr Justice McCombe sentenced her to an indefinite hospital order at Newcastle Crown Court in February last year.","Melanie Ruddell, 40, has been in a secure mental health unit since admitting manslaughter of Christy, 2 ."

Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin increased his majority in a recall election victory that delivered a warning shot to President Obama and showed that Republican politicians can face down unions and survive in office. Walker finished with a 7 per cent lead, confounding the exit poll results that had indicated a 50:50 split with Walker's Democratic rival Tom Barrett, mayor of Milwaukee. Turnout was very heavy and gave Republicans hope that Mitt Romney could prevail in the Democratic-leaning swing state that Obama won comfortably in 2008. Victor: Gov Scott Walker celebrates his recall win during a victory party after he defeated Democratic challenger Tom Barrett in the special recall election . The vote came after a bitter 15-month battle that divided Wisconsin, traditionally a centrist state, with union members and Democrats demonstrating against Walker's signing of a March 2011 law throwing out most collective-bargaining rights from public employees. In a race that became a nationally-significant contest, more than $63million was spent, most of it from conservative groups backing Walker. Although both Obama and Romney stayed away, both sides viewed the recall vote as a potential harbinger for November. Walker said his victory showed that fundamental issues of debt and deficits needed to be addressed, that austerity measures rather than increased spending was needed  and 'voters really do want leaders who stand up and take the tough decisions.' Survival: Scott Walker is the first governor in U.S. history to survive a recall attempt . Loss: Walker defeated Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett and the union leaders who rallied for months against his agenda . Voters chanted 'thank you Scott' as the governor proclaimed: 'Now is the time to move forward.' Walker affirmed his dedication to working with political foes, saying he would have a pow-wow with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle over brats, burgers and 'maybe a little bit of good Wisconsin beer.' Romney said that the 'results will echo beyond the borders of Wisconsin' and Walker had 'demonstrated over the past year what sound fiscal policies can do to turn an economy around, and I believe that in November voters across the country will demonstrate that they want the same in Washington.' The Obama campaign issued a statement saying: 'While tonight’s outcome was not what we had hoped for - no one can dispute the strong message sent to Governor Walker. Campaign: Wisconsin resident Don Richards carries a sign supporting the recall of Wisconsin Republican Scott Walker on election day in Caledonia, Wisconsin . Split on the issue: Both sides mobilized thousands of people and millions of dollars to influence voters, whom polls showed were more divided than ever . ‘Hundreds of thousands of Wisconsinites from all walks of life took a stand against the politics of division and against the flood of secret and corporate money spent on behalf of Scott Walker, which amounted to a massive spending gap of more than $31 million to $4 million.' Later Tuesday, Barrett conceded to Walker. In a concession speech, Barrett said: 'It is up to all of us, their side and our side, to listen. To listen to each other.' The recall effort, a rematch of the 2010 governor's race in the state, was branded a civil war in America's Dairyland. Barrett often accused Walker of . neglecting Wisconsin in the interests of boosting his own political . career by making the state 'the tea party capital of the country.'

Guilty: Eliska Novotna admitted repeatedly stabbing Arunas Ramanauskas at the Old Farmhouse at Easter Happrew Farm, near Peebles, last October . A woman who killed her housemate after tying him up, arming herself with a knife and stabbing him repeatedly was today facing a lengthy jail term after she was convicted of killing him. Eliska Novotna admitted repeatedly stabbing Arunas Ramanauskas at the Old Farmhouse at Easter Happrew Farm, near Peebles, last October. But she denied murdering him - claiming she had acted in self defence because Mr Ramanauskas had tried to sexually assault her. She had told a police officer that they 'played sexual games - then I killed him'. After an eight-day trial a jury took almost two hours to find her guilty of the lesser crime of culpable homicide. She now faces a long jail term when she is sentenced next month. Novotna earlier told the court how she tied a dressing gown cord round her housemate’s eyes and neck before arming herself with a knife, walking topless into his room then stabbing him to death. She said she stabbed him up to six times. The jury were shown graphic pictures of Mr Ramanauskas’s body lying on the floor with the blindfold still on. Pools of blood could be seen on the his bed, while the court heard he had suffered serious stab wounds on his chest and leg. PC Vanessa Hamilton earlier told how she came across Novotna walking on a road into Peebles near the town’s police station in the early hours of October 8. Novotna later told her: 'We played some sexual games - then I killed him.' The court heard that police investigating the murder found a stash of sex toys in a bedside cabinet in Mr Ramanauskas’s room. Novotna and Mr Ramanauskas had been spotted on CCTV cameras in a Sainsbury’s supermarket in Peebles hours before the attack. Murder scene: Novotna earlier told the court how she tied a dressing gown cord round her housemate's eyes, and neck, at the farmhouse pictured, before arming herself with a knife, walking topless into his room then stabbing him to death . They bought a bottle of rum and eight cans of Stella Artois before heading back to the remote farm.Novotna said Mr Ramanauskas borrowed a DVD from her before asking her to come and watch the film in his room. They discussed tattoos before Novotna claimed he started touching her 'lovingly'. She claimed to have left the room and gone to the kitchen where he later followed and began 'dancing' with her. Novotna said they then returned to his room where he took her top and bra off. She said she again ran out of the room - arming herself with a knife before going back into his room topless. Novotna said he pulled her on top of him and tried to make her perform a sex act before she stabbed him. She then walked six miles into Peebles where she was met by police. Novotna, 23, denied a charge of murdering Mr Ramanauskas on October 7 or 8 last year at The Old Farm House, Easter Happrew Peebles, by repeatedly stabbing him on the body with a knife. Novotna lodged a special defence of self defence in the case - and claimed Mr Ramanauskas had tried to sexually assault her. A jury of nine men and six women convicted her of culpable homicide in a majority verdict. Jim Keegan QC, defending, said he would reserve his plea in mitigation until a later sentencing date. Lady Clark of Calton deferred sentence on Novotna until June 19 at the High Court in Edinburgh. She said: 'I would express the sympathy of the court to the relatives of the victim - this has no doubt been a very difficult time for you.' Novotna showed no emotion as the verdict was read and stared at the relatives of her victim as she was led to the cells. Members of Mr Ramanauskas’s family had sat through every day of evidence with the aid of a Lithuanian interpreter. The family made no comment as they left court.","Eliska Novotna admitted repeatedly stabbing Arunas Ramanauskas at the Old Farmhouse at Easter Happrew Farm, near Peebles, last October .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 00:08 EST, 8 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 00:08 EST, 8 June 2012 . Though most of Congress is likely looking forward to the summer recess, the Federal Reserve chairman offered a grim warning as the Bush-era tax cut expiration date looms. ‘If you all go on vacation,’ Ben Bernanke said, ‘(Taxmaggedon is) still going to happen, so it’s important to be thinking about that and working with your colleagues to see how you might address that concern at the appropriate time.’ He spoke urgently of the Bush-era tax cuts that will cost taxpayers $130billion in increases if nothing is done to extend them. Grim warning: Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke warned Congress Thursday to make a decision on the Bush-era tax cuts that are set to expire . Arms crossed: Bernanke is pictured before testifying at a Joint Economic Committee hearing on economic outlook and policy on Capitol Hill in Washington . Speaking at the Joint Economic Committee, Bernanke painted a grim warning. ‘If allowed to occur…(it would) pose a significant threat to the recovery,’ he said. ‘If no action were taken and the fiscal cliff were to kick in its full size, I think it would be very likely that the economy would being to contract or possibly go even into recession.’ He also added that unemployment would again rise from its current high at 8.2 per cent. However, he said the Fed is prepared to take steps to boost the U.S. economy if it weakens. But he said Fed officials still need to study the most recent economic trends, including job growth. For now, Bernanke said he foresees moderate growth this year. He said he's mindful that all that could change, if Europe's crisis quickly worsened or U.S. job growth stalled. 'As always, the Federal Reserve remains prepared to take action as needed to protect the U.S. financial system and economy in the event that financial stresses escalate,' he told the Joint Economic Committee. The Fed could buy more bonds to try to further reduce long-term interest rates, which might encourage more borrowing and spending. Or it could extend its plan to keep short-term rates near zero beyond late 2014 until an even later date. Don't let it happen: He said that the tax cuts cannot expire, as more unemployment and even another recession could result . But most economists don't expect a major announcement at the Fed's next policy meeting June 19-20, despite signals this week from some other Fed members in favour of considering further action. For one thing, long-term U.S. interest rates have already touched record lows. Even if rates dropped further, analysts say they might provide little benefit for the economy. ‘If allowed to occur (Taxmaggedon) would pose a . significant threat to the recovery. If no action were taken . and the fiscal cliff were to kick in its full size, I think it would be . very likely that the economy would being to contract or possibly go even . into recession.' They say it's unlikely that many businesses and consumers who aren't borrowing now at super-low rates would do so if rates declined a bit more. And Bernanke could face pressure not to pursue further stimulus before the November election because such steps could be perceived as helping President Barack Obama win re-election. 'The Fed simulative effects have really run their course,' Obama's Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, argued in a television interview last week. John Ryding and Conrad DeQuadros, economists at RDQ Economics, said there was nothing in the testimony to 'tip Bernanke's hand' before the June meeting of the Fed's policy committee. 'Yes, the Fed chairman said the Fed stands ready to act if Europe poses a threat to the U.S. financial system or the economy,' they wrote in a note to clients. 'However, he gave no specifics.' An early rally on Wall Street faded after Bernanke signalled no immediate further steps from the Fed to help the economy. The Dow Jones industrial average had been up as much as 140 points. It closed up about 46 points, or 0.3 per cent. Presiding: Bernanke presides over a meeting of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, from second left to right, Federal Reserve Board of Governors: Janet Yellen; Elizabeth Duke; Daniel Tarullo; Sarah Raskin; Jeremy Stein; Jerome Powell . Many analysts are worried that the U.S. economy is suffering a midyear slump just as in 2010 and 2011. They're concerned in particular about the job market. From December through February, the economy added an average 252,000 jobs a month. But since then, job growth has slowed to a lacklustre 96,000 a month. In May, U.S. employers added just 69,000 jobs - the fewest in a year. Bernanke said the Fed is still assessing the most recent employment data. Like many economists, Bernanke suggested that a warm winter might have prompted some hiring that normally would have occurred later. That could have weakened hiring temporarily in the spring. If that's true, hiring might bounce back. Still, Bernanke said some of the winter hiring might have made up for excessive job cuts during the recession. If so, and if those companies have completed such 'catch-up' hiring, then stronger economic growth might be needed to boost hiring, Bernanke said. 'That is the essential question we will have to look at,' he told the panel. The government said last week that the economy grew at a sluggish annual rate of 1.9 per cent in the first three months of 2012. Paul Edelstein, an economist at IHS Global Insight, said he thought Bernanke didn't seem alarmed by the weak hiring in May. 'His view is that it isn't a sign that the economy is falling apart,' Edelstein said. Options: The Fed could buy more bonds to try to further reduce long-term interest rates, or it could extend its plan to keep short-term rates near zero beyond late 2014 . Bernanke's message to financial markets, Edelstein said, was, 'Don't expect anything drastic from the Fed at the June meeting.' That said, if the Fed does announce some new action at its meeting later this month, Edelstein said the most likely step would be to extend a program, known as Operation Twist, that will expire at the end of June. Under Operation Twist, the Fed sells shorter-term securities and buys longer-term bonds. As with other Fed bond purchases, the idea has been to drive down long-term rates so that mortgages, auto loans and other consumer and business loans become more attractive. The Fed's policy committee has been split between those who favor doing everything possible to strengthen the economy and reduce unemployment, and those more concerned about inflation risks. On Wednesday, Janet Yellen, the vice chairman of the Fed, Dennis Lockhart, the head of the Atlanta regional Fed Bank, and John Williams, president of the San Francisco Fed bank, all suggested that the Fed might need to do more to provide support. But Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, warned at Thursday's hearing against more bond buying. He and other critics worry that ever-lower borrowing rates could eventually ignite inflation. 'It is my belief that the Fed has done all that it can do and has perhaps done too much,' said Brady, vice chairman of the committee.","Chairman of the Fed Ben Bernanke offered grim warning to Congress if they do nothing over Bush-era tax cuts that will expire .

A frail woman was battered to death with a hammer after her killer tricked his way  into her home by posing as a  volunteer from the charity Age UK, a court heard yesterday. Judith Richardson, 77, was  murdered after she opened the front door of her modest ground-floor flat to 48-year-old Graeme Jarman, the jury was told. The pensioner, who had never  married and lived alone with her dog Hamish, was hit in the head at least 30 times by Jarman, it heard. In the dock: Graeme Jarman, left,  is accused of murdering 77-year-old Judith Richardson, right, with a hammer . After bludgeoning Miss Richardson to . death he then ransacked her bedroom before fleeing with her handbag and . jewellery, it is claimed. Robert Smith QC, prosecuting, said . there was ‘compelling’ CCTV footage which showed that Jarman, who was . jobless and living on benefits, had been stalking other elderly women in . the hours before her murder. He had watched her walk home a day earlier and selected her as a potential victim, the court heard. The murder last August was for no other reason than ‘personal gain’, Mr Smith told the jury. Jarman stole a hammer from a store and . the next day walked to Miss Richardson’s home in the market town of . Hexham on August 19, Newcastle Crown Court was told. Jarman, who denies murder, took two . leaflets issued by the charity Age UK, which he probably picked up in a . shop, Mr Smith said. ‘They were no doubt produced to her at her home ... as a means of persuading her to let him in.’ The leaflets were later found inside the hall of her home. Grim discovery: Judith Richardson's body was found at her home in Hexham, Northumberland, in August last year . One of them had Jarman’s fingerprints . on, Mr Smith said. The hammer used to kill her had been abandoned in a . carrier bag and placed on a wall next to her home. Targeted: Judith Richardson was not the victim of a 'random attack', a jury at Newcastle Crown Court heard . Mr Smith told jurors there was ‘clear . and material evidence’ linking Jarman to the killing. As well as the . fingerprints on the leaflets, his DNA was found on a blood-stained . tissue in Miss Richardson’s bedroom. On the day of the murder Miss Richardson, who had £105,000 in savings accounts, had just arrived home from the supermarket. She had put her shopping away and was . sitting down to have some toast when she was interrupted, the court . heard. ‘It’s likely that the person who killed her rang her doorbell,’ Mr Smith said. She was struck almost as soon as she . opened her front door, with the blow knocking her back on to the floor . of the hall, the court heard. After the attack, Jarman took a bus to . Newcastle city centre where he allegedly dumped Miss Richardson’s . handbag in a bin. The bag was later found and handed in to the police. Officers then discovered her body. Over the next few hours Jarman allegedly sold her jewellery for £300 and shaved off his hair. He was arrested two weeks later, 120 miles from Miss Richardson’s home, in Filey, North Yorkshire. The court heard how Jarman arrived in . Hexham two days before the murder, having ended his flat tenancy in . Consett, County Durham, and with just £1.55 in the bank. The day before . the attack he slept rough. CCTV footage appeared to show him . walking around the town centre, carrying a distinctive green bag and . talking to elderly residents. When he was arrested he admitted . selling the jewellery, but claimed he had found the handbag near her . home, as if by ‘divine intervention’. The trial continues.

France has called for the United Nations to enforce envoy Kofi Annan's six-point peace plan for Syria - in a move which could see force used against Assad's regime. Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said he was hoping that Russia, a key ally of Syria, would agree to invoking the UN's Chapter 7 to make it happen. It allows the use of military force. The first stage could be to impose a No Fly Zone and allow humanitarian aid into the country. But, as seen in other conflicts, could escalate to more drastic action if the regime doesn't bend to international demands. And echoing UN peacekeeping chief Herve Ladsous's comments yesterday, he said the Syrian conflict was now a 'civil war'. Plea: France's Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius (left) wants the UN to make Kofi Annan's (right) peace plan obligatory . He said: 'We propose making the implementation of the Annan plan compulsory. 'We need to pass to the next speed at the Security Council and place the Annan plan under Chapter 7 - that is to say make it compulsory under pain of very heavy sanctions.' France would propose toughening sanctions on Syria at the next meeting of EU foreign ministers, he added. And the international community would prepare a list of second-ranking military officials who would be pursued by international justice, alongside President Bashar Assad and his immediate entourage. He said: 'They must understand that the only future is in resisting oppression. The time for taking a decision has arrived. They have to jump ship.' Earlier today Syrian troops claimed to have won a bloody eight-day battle to regain control of a crucial rebel mountain-top hide-out - with the help of Russian attack helicopters. Troubled: UN peacekeeping chief Herve Ladsous . (left) said Syria was now in a full-scale civil war between President . Bashar Assad's (right) troops and rebel soldiers . State television boasted that forces loyal to brutal dictator Bashar Assad had 'cleared terrorist fighters' from the town of Haffeh. It came after more than a week of heavy fighting which led the U.S. to warn that a potential massacre would soon take place there. Newsreaders said the troops had 'restored calm and security in Haffeh' after they 'cleansed it of armed terrorist groups' - a term authorities use to describe rebels fighting Assad. The Russian helicopters are thought to be old ones and not the new batch referred to by U.S. Secretary of State Hilary Clinton yesterday. She said Washington was worried Russia may be sending attack helicopters to Syria. It prompted Russia's foreign minister to today defend his country's sale of arms to Syria and accuse the U.S. of supplying rebels with weapons to fight against the government. 'We are not violating any international law in performing these contracts,' said Sergei Lavrov, in response to a question about Clinton's comments at a news conference during a visit to Iran. 'They are providing arms and weapons to the Syrian opposition that can be used in fighting against the Damascus government,' he said on Iranian state television. Demanding change: Demonstrators in Kafranbel, near Idlib hold a placard (left) that reads: 'Are you dumb? Is there any sane person who really believes there could be a peaceful solution?' Russia is one of Syria's principal defenders on the diplomatic front and, as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council with the power to veto resolutions, has stymied efforts by Western powers to pressure President Bashar al-Assad into stepping down. Lavrov said Russia's position was based on concern for the Syrian people and the country's integrity, rather than personal preference for Assad. 'I have announced time and again that our stance is not based on support for Bashar Assad or anyone else ... We don't want to see Syria disintegrate.' Russia is resisting Western and Gulf Arab pressure to take a harder line against Assad, rejecting calls for sanctions and proposing a conference bringing together global and regional powers including Iran. Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi said the Syrian crisis could not be resolved by external powers. 'The Islamic Republic of Iran has announced many times: the issue of Syria needs to be dealt with in Syria by Syrians, not through the interference of others.' The United States says it does not believe Iran, Assad's closest regional ally, is ready to play a constructive role in Syria, where the United Nations says government forces have killed more than 10,000 people since March 2011. Last night the UN said that violence in Syria has escalated so much in the last five days that the country is now in a state of full-scale civil war. Conflict continues: An image grab taken from a video uploaded on YouTube on Monday shows smoke billowing from the flashpoint Syrian city of Homs which activists said was being attacked by regime forces . The organisation's chief peacekeepers has admitted for the first time that the bloodshed between President Bashar Assad's troops and rebels has reached unprecedented levels. Herve Ladsous, when asked if the Syrian conflict has escalated into civil war, replied: 'Yes, I think one can say that'. UN observers have seen a steep rise in violence and a dangerous shift in tactics by both sides in Syria in the last five days, his spokesman Kieran Dwyer added. The Syrian government, intent on wresting back control of rebel-held areas, is shelling heavily populated districts and using attack helicopters over cities 'with devastating impact on civilians,' Dwyer said. The opposition, in turn, is increasingly coordinating attacks against government forces and civilian infrastructure, and 'the conflict has reached all parts of Syria virtually,' he added. He also revealed that UN observers have been prevented from entering besieged rebel-held towns. They were pelted with  stones, metal rods and gunfire  as they tried to reach Haffa, where civilians were feared trapped by government shelling. The observers were not hurt as they were turned back by the assault on their vehicles yesterday. But other areas have also been blocked to their colleagues. 'Grave violations': The UN report says government forces have been using children as shields while attacking, torturing and killing residents during the 15-month crackdown on protesters . Last week, it took days for the monitors to reach Mazraat al-Qubair, where nearly 80 people were reportedly killed, because government troops and residents blocked them. As the conflict deteriorates into a murderous grind, regional power brokers from Iran to Turkey risk getting drawn into the fight. The UN's special envoy on Syria, Kofi Annan, asked governments with influence to 'twist arms' to end the bloodshed. But there are few signs the diplomatic pressure is having any measurable effect. 'The longer this violence continues, the more dangerous it becomes not only for the country and the Syrian people but the region,' Annan's spokesman, Ahmad Fawzi, told reporters in Geneva. 'It's dangerous and the red light is flashing.' The deteriorating situation in Haffa has raised alarm in the past eight days, and Washington had said on Monday that regime forces may be preparing a massacre in the village, which is about 20 miles from Assad's hometown of Kardaha in Latakia province along the Mediterranean coast. Activists said government forces were firing mortar rounds into the village. Calls to the area did not go through yesterday. The government restricts journalists from moving freely, making it nearly impossible to independently verify accounts from either side. Violence has escalated significantly in recent days as the government fights to reassert control of pockets of resistance across the country. Outrage: Mourners attend a mass burial in Syria for more than 100 people, half of whom were children, killed in a massacre in the city of Houla last month . Syrian forces fired mortars at protesters yesterday in the eastern city of Deir el-Zour, killing at least 10 people, activists said. Clashes also were reported in central Homs province. Amateur video of the mortar attack on Deir el-Zour showed some of the dead in a street as survivors screamed in panic and tried to remove their bodies. Other videos showed some of the wounded being treated at a hospital. The state news agency SANA blamed the Haffa violence on terrorists - the term it uses to describe rebels - who had attacked residents in the village. The report also said a reporter and a cameraman for the pro-government Ikhbariya TV were wounded when bullets hit their car in Haffa on Monday. Throughout the uprising, violence has rattled Latakia, an area of profound importance to the regime. Latakia province is the heartland of the Alawite minority to which Assad and the ruling elite belong, although there is a mix of religious groups. Syria's Sunni majority makes up the backbone of the opposition, and minorities such as Alawites and Christians have generally stuck to the sidelines, in part out of fears that they will be marginalized - or even face retribution - if Sunnis take over. International attention: UN observers view bodies at a hospital morgue before the burial of the Houla dead . As the violence worsens, world powers have struggled to find ways to end the bloodshed. Annan brokered a peace plan that was supposed to go into effect April 12 but never took hold. More than 13,000 people have died in Assad's crackdown on the uprising that began in March 2011 as part of the Arab Spring, according to activist groups. Annan renewed calls yesterday for the bloodshed to end. 'It is totally unacceptable and it must stop,' spokesman Fawzi said, 'and that is why Annan has invited governments with influence to raise the bar to another level, to the highest level possible, and twist arms if necessary, to get the parties to implement the plan.' He didn't specify the countries that might still have leverage with the Assad regime, but Russia, China and Iran are Syria's closest and strongest allies. Fawzi said it was up to the government to take the first step to end the violence. 'The stronger party should send a strong signal in good faith and stop the violence, and the stronger party in this case is clearly the government of Syria,' he said.","French Foreign Minister hopes Russia will agree to invoking UN's Chap. 7 .

"After the burning thousands of Afghans took part in riots that claimed 30 lives . By . Press Association Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 04:06 EST, 20 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:54 EST, 20 June 2012 . A military investigation is recommending that as many as seven U.S. troops are punished for the burning of Korans. They face administrative punishments, but not criminal charges, following the incident four months ago at a U.S. base in Afghanistan. U.S. military officials said the classified report and recommendations for disciplinary action against the service members involved were delivered to the Pentagon more than a week ago. Outrage: There have been scenes of furious protest across the Middle East following the burning of copies of the Koran at a NATO base in Afghanistan . They have been turned over to the Army and Navy secretaries, but no final decisions have yet been made. According to the officials, one Navy member and as many as six Army soldiers could face nonjudicial disciplinary actions. The punishments can range from a letter in their file to docking their pay or assigning them additional duties. The lack of any criminal charges being taken is because military officials feel the incident was regrettable, but a mistake. The decision is likely to anger Afghans who were enraged by the burning. Thousands took to the streets across the country in deadly riots after it happened. Volatile: Afghan policemen and US soldiers on the ground in Afghanistan where riots broke out across the country after troops burnt Korans and attacks on NATO soldiers became more frequent . More than 30 people were killed in the clashes, including two U.S. troops who were shot by an Afghan soldier. Two U.S. military advisers were also gunned down at their desks at the Interior Ministry. The Qurans and other Islamic books were taken from the Parwan Detention Facility. Officials believed that extremists being detained there were using the texts to exchange messages. Top man: Marine General John Allen, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, approved the report recommending disciplinary action . The religious books and other materials were put in burn bags and then later thrown into a fire pit used to burn garbage at Bagram Air Field, a major U.S. base north of Kabul. Military officials said the investigating officer in Afghanistan completed the report and recommended the disciplinary actions. The report was approved by Marine General John Allen, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, and forwarded to Pentagon. U.S. military officials spoke about the report on condition of anonymity because the matter is classified and still under review. Altogether, two Navy and nine Army service members in Afghanistan were sent back to the United States after the Quran burning. But, based on the investigating officer's report, several would not face any punishments. U.S. officials have said that the service members did not know what they were throwing into the burn pit and that the books were pulled out by Afghan workers before they were destroyed. President Barack Obama apologised to Afghan President Hamid Karzai for the incident. Afghan officials, however, have claimed the burning was intentional, and it reinforced perceptions in the country that Americans are insensitive to the Afghans' religion and culture. A preliminary joint investigation by senior U.S. and Afghan military officials concluded in March that mistakes were made, but there was no intent to desecrate the Qurans or other religious materials. Controversy: The religious books and other materials were put in burn bags and then later thrown into a fire pit used to burn garbage at Bagram Air Field, a major U.S. base north of Kabul . It has taken until now for the military to deliver the report and recommended punishments to senior Pentagon leaders for final action. Typically, the service secretaries review the recommendations, then designate a military commander to take the appropriate action. It could take weeks for the process to unfold and for any final decisions to be made. The military usually does not publicly disclose details of administrative punishments. Military officials said the Army soldiers are now at Fort Benning, Georgia.","One Navy member and as many as six Army soldiers face punishment .

"By . Deborah Arthurs . PUBLISHED: . 05:39 EST, 10 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:35 EST, 10 May 2012 . It is a full two and a half centuries since the fourth Earl of Sandwich is said to have demanded his hunk of meat be brought to him between two doorstop wedges of bread so he needn't take a break from gambling. His accidental invention, reported to have been the result of his wish to avoid gravy dripping onto his hands, was purportedly picked up by his gambling pals - I'll have the same as Sandwich!' - and the sandwich was born. The bread-based snack has since become one of Britain's most popular and enduring culinary creations, and forms the backbone of many a lunchbreak. Celebrating the sandwich: Tesco is marking 250 years of the nation's favourite bread-based snack with a Yorkshire pudding wrap . Thanks to its versatility, the potential permutations of the bread-based snack are endless. And this week, to celebrate 250 years of the sandwich, Tesco has launched a new sandwich range, Best Of British, celebrating Britain's most iconic foods and paying homage to the sandwich, which the store says is 'one of Britain's most famous contributions to world cuisine. Whether or not these combinations will elevate our global culinary status any higher is a matter of personal taste. The collection includes such delights as the Yorkshire pudding wrap, complete with British topside beef, roast potato and horseradish sauce. Thinking outside the (lunch)box: The Fourth Earl of Sandwich, 1718-1792, is said to have invented the sandwich when he instructed his kitchen staff to bring him his meat between two slices of bread so he could continue gambling . Or another, perhaps best left to the iron-stomached: the Scotch egg sandwich, stuffed with slices of haslet pork, free range egg and pickle. Joining Tesco on the Jubilee bandwagon is Gregg's, who plan to design a British-themed sandwich for every month of this anniversary year. An ardent gambler, the 4th Earl of . Sandwich refused to break from his games to dine formally. Instead, so . legend has it, he demanded his kitchen staff bring him slabs of beef . between hunks of bread, so that he might eat it without dripping gravy . on his cards. His . gambling chums, all eager to emulate their esteemed host, adopted the . same habit, and when the Earl ordered his snack, they would shout 'The . same as Sandwich!', and thus, the story goes, the sandwich was born. A . less colourful version of the tale is expounded in the Earl of . Sandwich's biography, by N.A.M. Rodger. He suggests that Sandwich, a . hardworking member of the military who was heavily involved with the . political world and the arts, is more likely to have eaten the . sandwiches at his desk. First up for May is their Beef and Horseradish Oval Bite, which they say is made up of 'succulent beef, horseradish and caramelised red onion chutney with spinach on an oval bite,' which roughly translates a beef sandwich on funny-shaped bread. Martin Kibler, Trading and Marketing Director at Greggs, said: 'A good sandwich still gets our tastebuds excited and is more often than not the thing we turn to when in need of a satisfying snack. This this is why it has remained so important to our food culture for so many years. 'As a business, we’ve been baking bread since the 1930s when our founder John Gregg started to deliver bread to the people of Newcastle. We know more than most about the importance of quality ingredients and how to make a great sandwich. Tesco sandwich buyer Debbie Allwright added: 'Britain has a fantastic culinary history that we wanted to celebrate with our greatest food creation of all - the humble sandwich. 'We know that this summer there will be a big appetite for heritage foods and we wanted to celebrate some of these in a new and tasty way. 'Millions of people look forward to eating Yorkshire pudding as part of their Sunday roast. 'Now they’ll be able to pick one up anytime they like in the form of a wrap.' Tesco has become well known for its sandwich innovations. This new range follows the strawberry and cream sandwich, created last year to celebrate Wimbledon fortnight, and the lasagna sandwich in 2010.",Tesco say the Yorkshire pudding wrap is 'iconic'

A police researcher who tipped off his drug dealer cousin about the location of suspected cannabis factories so their associates could raid the premises, has been jailed for three and a half years. Matthew Garness, 30, informed David Chitolie, 27, . about the location of two cannabis factories in Tottenham, North London, . which were later raided  by brothers Dwayne and Dean Edward. Incredibly Garness was standing for election as a Labour . councillor for Waltham Forest Council, pledging 'Safer Streets for . Leyton', at the time of the offences. (File picture): Crooked police researcher Matthew Garnessi tipped of his drug dealer cousin about the location of two cannabis factories in Tottenham, North London . Garness who worked at the Met's . Quicksilver Patrol Base, in Wood Green, north London, accessed the . forces CRIMINT and CRIS databases to obtain the information. and advised Chitolie on how to avoid detection. Garness was finally was rumbled in a police sting when officers planted information about a Mercedes being left with £5,000  and two kilos of cannabis inside. Jailing him for three years and five months Judge Deborah Taylor said: 'The seriousness of these offences is the nature and quantity of the information you supplied, the purposes for which it was supplied, and the effects of you supplying it. 'This was sustained and serious leaking of highly sensitive information to Chitolie which you knew was being and you had agreed to being used to identify and target cannabis factories.' Turning to Chitolie, who was jailed for three years and nine months, Judge Taylor said he played a 'significant role' in encouraging his cousin to abuse his powers. She said: 'You were not employed by the Metropolitan Police but you were of equal overall culpability. 'He was your cousin and you knew his job and knew where he was getting his information from.' Southwark Crown Court heard how Garness was standing for election as a Labour councillor for Waltham Forest Council, pledging 'Safer Streets for Leyton', at the time of the offences . The court heard Garness accessed police intelligence records regarding Chitolie and his associates between January and November 2010. Garness also passed on information about Imran Saleem, a serving soldier who had given Chitolie body armour and blank ammunition he brought back from Afghanistan. Prosecutor David Durose told the court: 'The defendant Garness, an employee of the Metropolitan Police, provided sensitive police information to a group of criminals via his cousin, the defendant Chitolie, a dealer in cannabis, during 2010. 'As well as providing information which was of general interest to Chitolie, Garness also supplied the details of suspected cannabis factories, and on one particular occasion the location of a motor vehicle which Garness had been told contained cash and drugs. 'This vehicle was in fact part of a covert operation aimed at the network. 'Chitolie passed on information received from Garness to other conspirators, including in the later stages of the conspiracy Dean Edwards and his brother, Dwayne. 'These individuals sought to steal drugs, and on the one occasion cash, that they had been notified about. 'This information led to burglaries being committed on residential properties. 'These defendants were arrested in November 2010, having been subject to significant police surveillance for a period of weeks beforehand. 'This surveillance included video and audio footage of Garness' workplace, audio probe footage from within Garness' car, and regular audits of Garness' activity on the police computers, including via a piece of software known as 'Spectre' which, in effect, replicated Garness computer screen at another location.' The barrister told the court that, ironically, on one occasion a bug in Garness' car captured him telling Chitolie how police tapped phone conversations and how to avoid being caught on tape. Before he could be arrested he passed on details of two more suspected cannabis farms, including one text that read '95 Lawrence Road, N17. Factory or church who ting is green' after reading a Crimestoppers report filed by a member of the public. Garness, of Homerton, east London, and Chitolie, of South Tottenham, north London, admitted conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office and conspiracy to steal. Chitolie also pleaded guilty to possession of cannabis and conspiracy to supply cannabis. Last year Dean Edwards of  Muswell Hill, admitted conspiracy to steal between January and November 2010 and was sentenced to four months behind bars suspended for 12 months and ordered to carry out 100 hours unpaid work. Dwayne Edwards of Enfield, also pleaded guilty to conspiracy to steal between on November 9 and was handed a community order and told to complete 40 hours unpaid work. Both men were ordered to pay £100 towards the cost of the case.","Matthew Garness, 30, was standing for election as a Labour councillor for Waltham Forest Council .

Celebrated painter LeRoy Neiman, whose colourful brushstrokes captured the motion and energy of stars across the sporting world, has died aged 91. Neiman was the official painter of five Olympic Games and was a contributing artist at Playboy magazine for many years.

Champ: Undisputed middleweight champion Bernard Hopkins holds up a portrait of himself painted by Neiman during a post-fight press conference at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas in 2004 . Neiman was a media-savvy artist who . knew how to enthrall audiences with his instant renditions of what he . observed. In 1972, he sketched the world chess tournament between Boris . Spassky and Bobby Fischer in Reykjavik, Iceland, for a live television . audience. He also produced live drawings of the Olympics for TV and was . the official computer artist of the Super Bowl for CBS. Neiman's . 'reportage of history and the passing scene ... revived an almost lost . and time-honoured art form', according to a 1972 exhibit of his Olympics . sketches at Indianapolis Museum of Art. 'It's been fun. I've had a lucky life,' Neiman said in a June 2008 interview. Big art of history: Neiman stands on the sidelines during Super Bowl XXI between the New York Giants and the Denver Broncos at the Rose Bowl on January 25, 1987 in Pasadena, California . 'I've zeroed in on what you would call . action and excellence. Everybody who does anything to try to succeed . has to give the best of themselves, and art has made me pull the best . out of myself.'

He worked in many media, producing thousands of etchings, lithographs and silkscreen prints known as serigraphy. But Neiman's critics said his forays into the commercial world minimised him as a serious artist. At Playboy, for example, he created Femlin, the well-endowed nude who has graced the magazine's Party Jokes page since 1957. Neiman was fascinated with large game animals and said he twice travelled to Kenya to paint lions and elephants in the bush in his trademark vibrant palette. But it was the essence of a basketball or gridiron game, swimming meet or cycling event that captured his imagination most. 'For an artist, watching a (Joe) Namath throw a football or a Willie Mays hit a baseball is an experience far more overpowering than painting a beautiful woman or leading political figure,' Neiman said in 1972. With his sketchbook and pencil, trademark handlebar moustache and slicked-back hair, Neiman was instantly recognisable. At a New York Jets game at Shea Stadium in 1975, fans yelled, 'Put LeRoy in', when the play was not going their way. Painter to the stars: Neiman seen sketching Cher in September, 1981 at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas . Neiman's decades-long association with . Playboy began in 1953 following a chance meeting with Hugh Hefner. It . was the start of what he called 'the good life' and inspiration for much . of his future work. He . regularly contributed to the magazine's 'Man at His Leisure' feature, . which took him to such places as the Grand National and Ascot race . meetings in England, the Cannes Film Festival in France and the Grand .

Neiman was a Second World War veteran who participated in the invasion of Normandy and fought in the Battle of the Bulge. He . was a self-described workaholic who seldom took vacations and had no . hobbies.

Accolades: Neiman was inducted into the New Jersey Boxing Hall of Fame and the International Boxing Hall of Fame.

They're highly-trained search and rescue pilots who risk life and limb to rescue people trapped in dangerous and life-threatening situations. So it was perhaps a bit of a surprise for RAF Chivenor’s 22 Squadron when they were called to free a man trapped bottom up in a bramble bush. Marcus Wilde got himself into the prickly situation when a model aircraft he was flying, near . the Morte Point beauty spot at Woolacombe, Devon, . crash-landed. Morte Point, viewed from Woolacombe, Devon, where Marcus Wilde got himself into a prickle when trying to retrieve his model aircraft . The 42-year-old waded into the thick, thorny . undergrowth to retrieve the plane, but he got so tangled in the brambles . that he couldn’t get out again. The local coastguard and a search and . rescue helicopter from RAF Chivenor’s 22 Squadron were scrambled to the . scene. The chopper hovered over the bushes and crews managed to cut down the brambles and winch him to safety. However, some members of the public have criticised the rescue saying it was a waste of public money to send out a helicopter for someone stuck in a bush. A coastguard spokesman said: 'He . wasn’t badly injured but he’d been stuck fast in the brambles and it . seemed the simplest way to get him out. It was certainly one of our more . unusual rescues.' Construction worker Mr Wilde, of . Braunton, Devon, said he was stuck in the bush for an hour, unable to crawl out. Marcus Wilde struggled for an hour after falling 15ft into chest deep in brambles. He said he was covered in cuts and it was a distressing, horrible experience . He said: 'A group of six of us were . flying model aircraft on Morte Point and unfortunately mine lost signal . with the remote control and got stuck in a bush. 'The plane is worth £200 and contains a battery which can catch fire so I decided to try and retrieve it.' He started his hunt in a patch of soft bracken while being guided by a friend looking down from a slope above him. However, Mr Wilde could not see a 15ft drop in front of him and tumbled down the bank into the two-metre deep bramble patch. He said: 'I was completely stuck . upside down and covered in cuts. My clothes were ripped to pieces. The . more I struggled, the worse it got. 'I felt helpless, distressed, disorientated and dehydrated. It was a horrible experience.' Mr Wilde has hit back at critics who said it was a waste of public money to mount such a large rescue operation for someone who'd toppled into a thorn bush. He said the experience was 'extremely frightening' He added: 'They couldn’t see me at . first because I was so deeply buried. When they did find me they . attached a harness, told me to curl up into a ball and literally ripped . me out of the brambles. 'What made the whole thing even more . embarrassing was that I knew almost all of the rescue crew as I fly . model airplanes at Chivenor most weeks.' Mr Wilde has been in for stick through online . forums from people who claimed it had been 'stupid and a waste of public . money' to mount such a large rescue operation for someone who’d toppled . into a thorn bush. But Mr Wilde has hit back, saying: 'The experience was extremely frightening and I found people’s comments afterwards very offensive. 'This is exactly what the emergency . services are here to do - deal with emergencies. Unless you were there . you really can’t appreciate it,' he said.

Alaska, said the whale died in the early hours of Monday, a few hours . after it became clear that its condition was declining. They said the calf would never have survived for as long as it did were it not for the care that teams of experts provided. It was believed to be the first baby beluga rescue in the US, at least since federal record keeping began in 1972. In . a statement, the centre's president and chief executive, Tara Riemer . Jones, said: 'We are deeply saddened by the loss of this beluga calf. 'But we are incredibly proud of the care that the multi-institution animal and veterinary team provided. 'The . knowledge they brought from the whales in their care at their home . institutions allowed us to provide the best medical and animal care . possible to this calf. 'There . is more we will continue to learn about beluga whales as a result of . this loss that will ultimately benefit beluga whales in the marine . mammal community and in the wild.' Unable to survive: The baby beluga whale died at the Alaska SeaLife Center, where it was being cared for by marine mammal specialists from four different centres . The calf was found on June 18 near South Naknek, Alaska, where no other beluga whales could be seen in the immediate vicinity. Witnesses called the Alaska SeaLife Center, where staff were authorised to attempt a rescue. The calf was then flown 90 miles from South Naknek to Seward in a plane. It was placed on an air mattress throughout the journey and positioned so its vital organs would not be damaged under its own weight. Legacy: Experts believe the lessons learned while caring for the mammal will ultimately benefit other beluga whales. (File photograph) Progress: Experts hope to learn more about the species so that beluga whales at mammal centres and in the wild can receive more support . Staff vet Carrie Goertz said at the time: 'The calf is swimming on his own, cooperating with feedings, and breathing regularly, which are all very positive signs. 'However, there are tremendous hurdles ahead. Because this animal is extremely young, it is at a very high risk of complications.' On arriving at the aquarium, the whale remained in critical care but it learned to take food from a bottle and started putting on weight. It was five feet long and weighed 115lbs - 5lbs more than it did on arrival. Vets were today due to carry out a full necropsy on the whale's remains in the hope of determining the cause of death. However, staff have admitted further tests are likely to follow in the coming months and they may never know why the whale died. The Alaska SeaLife Center is the only permanent marine rehabilitation center in Alaska, responding to stranded wildlife such as sea otters, harbor seals, and whales.

David Cameron was yesterday urged in the Commons to finally end Gary McKinnon’s decade of suffering and give the Asperger’s sufferer ‘his life back’. The Prime Minister came under pressure to deliver on his promise to show ‘compassion’ towards Mr McKinnon, whom the Americans accuse of hacking into military computers. In Opposition, both Mr Cameron and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg promised to help Mr McKinnon, who judges and doctors say could take his own life if extradited. David Cameron has come under pressure to deliver on his promise to give Gary McKinnon 'his life back' But, two years after the Coalition came to power, he remains in limbo - waiting to see if he will be bundled on a plane to the US, where he faces spending a decade or more behind bars . Mr McKinnon, now 46, was first arrested on charges of hacking into NASA and Pentagon computers from his north London home on March 9, 2002 - meaning he has already spent ten years living in constant fear. Yesterday, at Prime Minister’s Questions, his plight was again raised by the campaigning Tory MP David Burrowes. Mr Burrowes said: ‘The Prime Minister has called for compassion for my constituent Gary McKinnon, who doctors report is likely to take his life if he is extradited. Mr McKinnon, pictured with his mother Janis Sharp, was first arrested in 2002 . ‘The Deputy Prime Minister has also said that it would be cruel if he were to be extradited. ‘So can the government be true to its word and stop the extradition and finally after ten years give Gary McKinnon his life back?’ Mr Cameron replied that the Home Secretary, Theresa May, was currently considering new medical evidence about the hacker and would reach a decision soon. Judges have said that, under the very strict terms of the UK/U.S extradition deal, it would not be a breach of Mr McKinnon’s rights to bundle him on a plane. But his supporters say that the risk . of suicide - which has been acknowledged by the courts - should be . sufficient grounds for Mrs May to intervene. A . string of Labour Home Secretaries approved Mr McKinnon’s extradition - . severely limiting the options still left open to Mrs May. She . has been studying the medical reports for a number of months, with the . courts pressing for a decision in the case before the end of July. Mrs . McKinnon’s mum, Janis Sharp, says consultant forensic psychiatrist Jan . Vermeulen, who is a Home Office approved expert, considered her son . ‘unfit for trial’ and at extreme risk of suicide in April 2012. His report, which has been sent to Mrs May, concluded: ‘If he survives the transit to the USA, he will be so traumatised that he may remain unfit to plead for a considerable period. Nick Clegg, pictured with Mrs Sharp outside the Home Office in 2009, has also pledged his support to Mr McKinnon in the past . ‘I strongly recommend that once Mr McKinnon has recovered from his current ordeal his trial takes place in the U.K.’ The Mail has been campaigning for the past three years to halt Mr McKinnon’s extradition to the U.S. He has also been backed by a string of MPs, mental health charities and celebrities, who all argue that he should stand trial in the UK. His alleged crimes were committed from the bedroom of his north London flat. He hacked into both NASA and Pentagon computers while looking for evidence of the existence of ‘little green men’. Mr McKinnon’s case sparked huge concern over the U.K/US Extradition Act, which opponents argue is lopsided. MPs have demanded a change in the law so that, in future, Britons will be placed on trial in the UK if that is where the bulk of their offending took place. Mrs May is separately considering a report into where there needs to be significant changes to the extradition treaty, which was signed by Labour in 2003.","Prime Minister urged to deliver on promise to show 'compassion' to British hacking suspect .

"By . Sam Dunn . PUBLISHED: . 18:34 EST, 28 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:07 EST, 29 June 2012 . Tax officials were forced to write off more than £5billion they were owed last year. An annual report of HM Revenue & Customs accounts by the National Audit Office also revealed it overpaid £2.5billion in tax credits because of fraud and error. It also underpaid nearly £300million in tax credits, short-changing many families who rely on the relief to pay household bills. The write-offs for the year ending March 31, 2012, include £756million in lost income tax from HMRC’s botched effort to introduce a new PAYE tax collection system in 2010. HM Revenue and Customs: Last year, the UK tax system was branded 'inefficient, overly complex and frequently unfair' by the Institute for Fiscal Studies . The report found the total amount of tax debts being pursued stood at £13.3billion at the end of March, down from £15billion last year. But auditors found the tax credit fraud rate was rising to between 7.5 and 8.8 per cent, missing a target of 5 per cent. Margaret Hodge, chairman of the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee said she was stunned by the size of the losses. She said: ‘The sheer scale of waste and mismanagement at HMRC never ceases to shock. ‘It wrote off a staggering £5.2 . billion of tax owed, overpaid nearly £2.5 billion in tax credits due to . fraud and error and underpaid around £290 million. ‘This year has seen a litany of tax . errors and scandals come to light with mistakes made at the most senior . level from the Permanent Secretary for Tax downwards. Stunned: Margaret Hodge . ‘HMRC needs to get a grip before it . introduces its new real time Pay-As-You-Earn information systems and . begins the high-risk move from tax credits to the universal credit.’ Every year, HMRC matches up all its files to ensure people have paid the correct tax, called an ‘end of year reconciliation’. This used to be a fiendishly complex task as the UK had 12 different computer systems. After their merger, it was hoped this would smooth out discrepancies and allow PAYE taxpayers to pay the correct samount of income tax and National Insurance. However, two years ago, the Government conceded the new computer had found 5.8  million people who had paid the wrong tax between 2008 and 2010. The resulting chaos saw millions hit with tax bills they couldn’t afford, in particular hitting many pensioners who had no idea they even owed money going back several years. As it struggled to deal with the backlog, HMRC decided to cut its workload by simply writing off much of this revenue. The NAO report also found the total amount of tax debts being pursued stood at £13.3 billion at the end of March, down from £15 billion last year.Of this, some £4bn is owed in tax credit payments. But HMRC was also forced to write off old tax credit debts worth £1.7bn and admit a further £2.3bn is unlikely to ever be recovered. Its target of cutting the level of tax credit fraud and error to 5 per cent was missed. In fact, the fraud rate was rising to between 7.5 and 8.8 per cent, the auditors found. Under fire: HMRC also underpaid nearly £300million in tax credits, short-changing many families who rely on the relief to pay household bills . Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office, said: ‘Staff at HMRC should get a better understanding of the costs and benefits of its interventions – such as debt campaigns and initiatives to drive down levels of error and fraud in tax credits. ‘It should prioritise and target its activities on the basis of a better understanding of risks, such as the risk-profiling of taxpayers.’ He added that, ahead of the Revenue’s planned switch to so-called ‘real time’ PAYE collection – where workers’ tax affairs can be calculated on a minute-by-minute basis – it had much work to do to understand how its business will change. An HMRC spokesman said: ‘We have a long way to go but the report reflects progress we have made.’ Last year, the UK tax system was branded ‘inefficient, overly complex and frequently unfair’ by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. HMRC is failing to collect more than £35 billion a year from cheats who refuse to pay their taxes and others who find ways of avoiding them, MPs warned last month. It has set up a string of tax evasion taskforces to target industries where it suspects many are refusing to pay the correct amount of tax. Their targets currently include cab drivers, professional landlords with a large portfolio of homes and restaurant owners. An HMRC spokesman said: ‘We have a long way to go but the report reflects progress we have made.’",HM Revenue & Customs also underpaid in tax credits .

A life-extending drug hailed as a breakthrough for prostate cancer sufferers and used to treat Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset Ali al-Megrahi is 'too expensive' to be taken on the NHS. Cabazitaxel, which is marketed as Jevtana, can extend the life of late-stage patients by an average of three months. Libyan terrorist al-Megrahi, 60, is taking the drug and has survived for three years after he was released on compassionate grounds from a Scottish prison after a doctor said he had only three months to live. Lockerbie bomber and prostate cancer sufferer Abdulbaset Ali al-Megrahi at his home in Tripoli last October. He has been taking life-extending drug cabazitaxel which has today been deemed 'too expensive' to be used on the NHS . But the NHS rationing body, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice), today said it is not value for money despite admitting it works. Nice confirmed its original decision in January, rejecting an appeal by the drug’s manufacturers Sanofi. But cancer charities said the decision could mean a postcode lottery and effectively prevent thousands of men from accessing life-extending treatment. Each year around 37,000 men in the UK are diagnosed with prostate cancer and 10,000 die from the disease. It is the second most common cause of cancer death in men, accounting for 13 per cent. Nice said that while the drug is clinically effective, at £22,000 per patient it does not offer value for money for the NHS, and there are concerns over side-effects. Nice chief executive Sir Andrew . Dillon said: 'We need to be sure that new treatments provide sufficient . benefits to patients to justify the significant resources the NHS would . need to make available. An electron micrograph of prostatic cancer cells. The new drug prolonging life for sufferers was today officially rejected by the NHS rationing body . 'Although cabazitaxel can extend life . for some patients, its price remains well above what the independent . committee appraising this drug considered acceptable, given the benefits . it offers. 'Cabazitaxel is also associated with a . number of side effects, and the committee was concerned about the . nature of the health-related quality of life information provided by the . manufacturer.' Whenever a new drug is made available, the money to fund it has to come from elsewhere in the NHS. Nice said it must look at the benefit for patients the NHS can get for the money the drug company is asking. But Professor Jonathan Waxman of Imperial College London said the cost argument was false. He said: 'This decision seeks to limit what we as clinicians can do for our patients and their families. 'The cost argument on which Nice bases their decision is false, giving a much higher estimate of true cost than applies in reality. 'As a result, yet another successful . and effective cancer treatment is denied our patients, a mortifying blow . to cancer care in England. 'As . the only route to access is now the Cancer Drugs Fund, a temporary . arrangement that operates very differently around the country, I fear . we’re heading towards a re-emergence of the postcode lottery.' A police officer walks past the wreckage in Lockerbie, Scotland, of Pan Am Flight 103 from London to New York. The December 1988 bombing killed 270 people . Emma Malcolm, chief executive of the charity Prostate Action, said: 'Cabazitaxel is one of only two licensed drugs available in the UK that offers the hope of precious extra time and quality of life benefits to men living with advanced prostate cancer. 'Nice’s decision not to recommend this drug means that men in England with advanced prostate cancer have to access it through the Cancer Drugs Fund. 'We know that there are inconsistencies across the country with how this fund is awarded, which means some men will only be able to access one of these drugs in some areas. 'Men with advanced prostate cancer have so few treatment options available to them that they should be able to access both of these new treatments.” The Cancer Drugs Fund, set up in 2010 to allow access to drugs rejected by Nice or not yet licensed, is only available until 2014 and only applies in England. Prostate cancer patients are also waiting for Nice to issue their decision on abiraterone, another life-extending treatment, which is due soon.","Cabazitaxel, marketed as Jevtana, can extend the life of late-stage patients by average of three months .

A dog owner who watched his pet Rottweiler savagely maul a seven-year-old boy has been jailed for 16 months after being recognised by his mother in CCTV footage posted on YouTube. Rowan Diedrick, 29, was walking his two pet Rottweilers off the lead along Southend seafront in Essex when one attacked a young boy as he was paddling in the sea and dragged him underwater. Diedrick fled the scene immediately on August 5 last year prompting a six-month police campaign to track the mystery dog owner. The young boy - who cannot be named for legal reasons - was rescued by his grandmother and needed 60 stitches after suffering several puncture wounds to his left arm and shoulder during the attack. He has since endured three separate operations and will be offered plastic surgery when he reaches the age of 18 due to the extent of his injuries. The unemployed builder, from Enfield, North London, was eventually arrested in February after his own mother shopped him to police after recognising him fleeing the scene in seafront CCTV footage posted on video site YouTube. Diedrick appeared in the dock at Basildon Crown Court today wearing a black suit and tie with a suitcase packed in anticipation of an extended stay in jail. He was sentenced to 16 months in prison having pleaded guilty in March to being in charge of a dog which was dangerously out of control in a public place and caused injury. Judge Owen Davies QC said: 'The fact that the boy did not drown or was not mauled to a greater extent was down to the heroic and selfless actions of his grandmother. 'You allowed your dogs to roam without muzzles on a public beach. The behaviour you displayed after the event shows a callous disregard for the welfare of the victim.

It was only thanks to the vigilance of others on YouTube that you were traced. 'You had every interest in escaping without being brought to account. Any remorse you have shown is merely for your own fate.' But Judge Davies banned Diedrick from keeping a dog for the next 10 years and a destruction order was made for the four-year-old Rottweiler. After sentencing the family of the boy said: 'We can never say enough how grateful we are that we still have our grandson and that he seems to be recovering well despite his injuries. 'We are pleased with today’s sentence and feel it was completely irresponsible of the defendant to take two large dogs onto a beach without being able to control them on leads.

Experts say that twice the average rainfall will be . required over the coming months to replenish the water table. It was 1921 when the UK last went through a drought as bad as the current crisis. The dry arid conditions thought to have partly inspired TS Eliot's famous poem The Wasteland - although commentators believe it was also an allegory for the First World War. The work was partly written in Margate which that year broke the record for receiving a total yearly rainfall of just 236mm which meant it technically classed as a desert. It is hoped that restrictions by seven suppliers, due to come into effect on Thursday will enable the country to cope with such a severe drought this summer. Consumer groups and MPs yesterday called on water companies to provide clearer, more consistent information. Last month the companies issued an 11-point diktat in an attempt to stop customers flouting the terms, backed up by the threat of fines of £1,000 if they are prosecuted. Three weeks ago, hundreds of . thousands of pensioners were told they would be spared from the ban. But . company bosses scrapped the exemption this week following complaints . from younger customers. Other . water companies told gardeners that drip hoses – which allow only a . trickle of water – were banned. But they have since changed their mind, . and now say irrigation  systems are permitted. March . has been particularly dry and warm, with an average temperature of . 8.5C, about 3C above the normal, making it potentially the third driest . March since records began in 1659. Last . week most areas of the UK received less than 1mm of rainfall and the . dry conditions have caused streams and rivers in Herefordshire, . Glouestershire Oxfordshire and Yorkshire to dry up. The Environmental . Agency is now on standby to transfer fish to safety. Taking a dip: The UK is suffering the worst drought since 1921. This photo shows three young women cooling off at Herne Bay in August that year. Inspired: The arid landscape of drought hit England in 1921 is believed to have partly inspired TS Eliot's acclaimed poem The Wasteland. Rules on which businesses are allowed to clean patios, paths and decking in domestic gardens have also changed. A spokesman for the Consumer Council for Water said: ‘It is very important that the companies are consistent in their information to customers about what they can and can’t do.’ Norman Baker, Lib Dem MP for Lewes in East Sussex, which is covered by Southern and South East Water, told the Mail: ‘I am dismayed by the uncertainty which has been created about who is  eligible for help and who is not and where the bans are. ‘It is imperative that South East and Southern Water make the situation clear to my constituents.’ The restrictions – imposed by . Southern Water, South East Water, Thames Water, Anglian Water, Sutton . and  East Surrey, Veolia Central and Veolia South East – will start . before the Easter Bank Holiday weekend, one of the busiest times of the . year for gardeners. Two . weeks ago South East Water, which supplies two million people in Kent, . Sussex, Hampshire, Surrey and Berkshire, said all customers over 65 . would be spared from the ban. But . this week, the company said: ‘We have revised it as a result of . feedback from other customers who didn’t  think it was a fair . concession. It was also confusing because other water companies weren’t . doing the same  thing.’ While . more than 250 water abstraction licences have been cut for farmers, the . mild, dry weather has benefited commercial tomato growers who are in . the unusual position of being able to harvest their crop a month early . and 100 tonnes are expected to be picked on the Isle of Wight next week.","Ban on hosepipes and sprinklers the most widespread for seven years .

"By . Lee Moran . UPDATED: . 10:13 EST, 23 December 2011 . Mystery surrounds the identity of a sharp-suited woman who has suddenly appeared amongst the new North Korean leader's entourage. Rumours are circulating that the woman pictured standing behind Kim Jong Un at Kumsusan Memorial Palace, as guests paid respects to his dead father Kim Jong Il, is in fact his wife. If true, her presence could indicate a new openness for the pariah state - as it would be in stark contrast to the departed leader's secretive ways. Scroll down for video... Partner: The identity of the woman behind Kim Jong Un has prompted much speculation, with some believing it could be his wife and others reporting it is his sister . Lying in state: The woman was pictured during footage of tributes being paid to North Korean leader Kim Jong Il at the Kumsusan Memorial Palace in Pyongyang . Kim Jong Il, who died of a heart attack on Saturday, was known to have fathered seven children by four women. But it has never been made clear who, if anyone at all, it was he married. Excitement over 28-year-old Kim Jong Un's pretty new companion has grown after she was pictured among senior leaders which included the 83-year-old Kim Yong Nam, the chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly. She stood out against the line of old, fat and uniformed men around her as she seemingly confirmed recent South Korean reports that the new leader was married to a doctoral student at the prestigious Kim-il Sung University in Pyongyang. Although she was not named, she was said to be from the northeastern city of Chongjin, and to be two years younger than her husband. Mysterious: One of a select few images of Kim Jong Il with any members of his family, but no sign of his daughters . Father and son: A rare image of Kim Jong Il and his third son Kim Jong Un during his youth. Kim Jong Il has almost never been pictured with his daughters . The Daily NK website also revealed she gave birth to his daughter last year. While commentators believe the most likely story is that she is indeed his wife, some have suggested she could actually be one of the late Dear Leader's four daughters. Japanese celebrity magician Prince Tenko (pictured) could be one of the few non-Koreans to attend Kim Jong Il's funeral. The artist, whose real name is Tenko Hikita, performed in Pyongyang at his invitation in 1998 and 2000. She is also said to have had several private dinners with him, and has revealed she has received messages from Kim's relatives inviting her. She said she had yet to decide whether to accept. Kim Jong Il had four daughters and the oldest, Kim Hye Kyong, would be in her early 40s. Another, Kim Yo-chong, was born in the late 1980s. Little else is known about them. The guessing game comes as North Korea made another step towards openness by saying it will admit delegations from the South that wish to visit Pyongyang to express their condolences. An official website yesterday wrote: 'We will guarantee all convenience and safety of the South Koreans during their visit'. It added that the North would open . 'all air routes and land routes through Kaesong' in reference to its . industrial park some 27 miles) north of Seoul. North .

A model who caused a car crash after drinking so much sparkling wine she could hardly say her own name has walked free from court. Motorbike calendar beauty Monica McDermott, 38, was almost four times the limit and could barely stand after she shared two bottles of Cava with friends at a business meeting. But despite arranging a lift home, the blonde - a single mother to a six-year-old boy - decided to drive home after the networking event with a cosmetics company. Ashamed: Monica McDermott walked free from Macclesfield Magistrates' Court . On her way home she ploughed her Nissan car into a stationary taxi, drove on and was seen stopping and starting, swerving across the road and mounting a grass verge. A police officer who eventually stopped McDermott near her £200,000 apartment in the village of Alderley Edge, Cheshire, said she was so drunk he could only understand the word 'Monica' as she slurred out her name. She was also so unsteady on her feet the officer had to hold her up to stop her falling over. Although the model gave a roadside breath test, McDermott was too inebriated to give a second breath sample back at the police station. Magistrates . in Macclesfield were told she woke up in a police cell the next morning . unable to recall any of her drunken driving jaunt the night before. McDermott, . who models at Brands Hatch and featured on the SBK World Superbike . Championship calendar, yesterday admitted failing to provide a breath . test and was given an eight-week jail term suspended for 12 months. She was also ordered to complete a six month community order during which she ill have to attend alcohol awareness course. She was further banned from driving for two years and ordered to pay £100 costs. Earlier Neil Audley, prosecuting, said that at 11.10pm on February 16 taxi driver Anthony Bentley was parked in Alderly Edge when he heard a crunching sound. Banned: The model will not be allowed to drive for two years . He saw a silver Nissan drive off, with a blonde woman with a ponytail driving. He took down the registration and called the police. A police officer, who had taken down the details on making his way through Prestbury village towards Alderly Edge, saw the Nissan five minutes later. 'It was swerving and kept stopping and mounted the grass verge,' said Mr Audley. 'She was on her own in the car and when officers asked her to get out, her speech was slurred and they could smell intoxicants on her breath. 'They asked her name but could only understand ""Monica""; they could not decipher anything else. 'They had to assist her because she was falling over.' A roadside breathalyser showed a reading of 138microgrammes (mg) of alcohol in 100 mililitres of breath. The legal limit is 35mg. McDermott was then to Middlewich police station but could not provide breath tests. She was blowing into the bag to softly and then blowing too hard before speaking to the policeman. He asked if there was any medical reasons as to why she couldn't but she said no. The court heard McDermott had attended a meeting that evening between 4pm and 9pm with a cosmetics company and she drank Cava with friends. Her lawyer, Daniel Brooks, said: 'She had no recollection of driving and arrangements had been put in place to leave her vehicle at the networking event. 'She had left the event to put her bag in the car but it seems to be one of those cases where she was so intoxicated that she made a drunk and irrational, stupid and out-of-character decision to drive. 'Her friends sent her text messages asking where she was. 'Instead of depositing her heavy handbag she drove. 'She had suffered a head injury and had no recollection of the incident, effectively waking up in the cell. 'This can be attributed to alcohol. 'She has no memory of what went on in that road and in the police station. It wasn't even a wilful refusal to give a breath sample - she made several attempts. 'At first she blew too hard and then too softly then started to speak to the officer about her son and lost concentration. 'She was effectively too drunk to do it. 'It is not lost on her how serious this is and what disastrous consequences could have followed. 'You will see from the report that she accepts full responsibility for the offence and has apologised to the taxi driver. 'She has been extremely scared about what could happen to her and she regrets her actions. 'She has been torturing herself about what went on on that night and what could happen. 'She works hard to provide for her son with little or no support. In terms of credit, she has provided a guilty plea. 'It would be a disaster for her and her child if she was taken into custody. 'She is at a low risk to harm to the public. 'This was a one-off offence. It is not somebody who has a significant alcohol history. 'This has been a wake-up call for Miss McDermott and it is unlikely that court will ever see her again.' Passing sentence, magistrate Mr Peter Nash told McDermott: 'You were so intoxicated that you had no recollection of what happened but you have expressed remorse. 'However, we believe you have behaved recklessly and and you placed yourself and other road users in extreme danger.'","Motorbike calendar model Monica McDermott, was almost four times the limit and could barely stand, magistrates heard .

A woman who shared a late-night taxi with Premier League footballer Titus Bramble claimed he grabbed her hand and put it on his crotch, a court heard yesterday. When the Sunderland defender repeated the action, the woman said 'this is not right, stop' and started pleading to be taken home, the jury was told. The concerned cab driver, Abid Hussain, then took matters into his own hands because the woman looked scared - and drove the pair straight to a police station. To ‘pull the wool’ over Bramble’s eyes, the driver told him they were going to the station because the star had given him the wrong up-front fare. But once inside he asked to be seen alone by officers and alerted them to the incident. The woman said that although she had kissed Bramble earlier that evening outside a pub, she then 'came to her senses' - and only agreed to share the taxi with him as the club he was going on to was en route to her home. At the station, she made a statement and Bramble, 30, was later arrested. Yesterday, the player appeared in court accused of assaulting two women within 30 minutes of each other on a night out last September. In the first incident it is claimed he grabbed a woman’s bottom in a nightclub. But in the second he is said to have repeatedly assaulted the girl in the cab. Teesside Crown Court heard Bramble had been out partying in the North Yorkshire village of Yarm when the alleged assaults took place. Titus Bramble is charged in connection with alleged incidents during a night out in Yarm, Teesside, on September 28 last year . Taxi driver Abid Hussain (above) is said to have driven Sunderland FC player Titus Bramble to a police station in September last year after the football star had allegedly groped a woman in the back of the cab . His first alleged victim was drinking in the same club with friends, including an off-duty police officer, when Bramble is said to have grabbed her bottom. It was not a slap or a pat, but a full-hand grab, she told the jury. She told the court: ‘As I turned round I looked up and saw him smirk at me. I felt very uncomfortable so I walked towards my friend, the off-duty police officer. I said: “He’s just grabbed my a***.” 'He said: “He plays for Sunderland”. I said: “I don’t care what he does, he’s not grabbing me like that”.’ Half an hour later, at 1.30am, Bramble left the Cross Keys, a pub which also operates as a club, and approached his second alleged victim outside. She was trying to help a drunken friend to her feet when he is said to have grabbed her by the hand and led her down an alleyway and started kissing her. Prosecutor Shaun Dodds said: ‘She accepts she kissed him back but then came to her senses…so she walked back to her friend. ‘The defendant was talking to a friend about going to a club in Middlesbrough so asked the girl if she would be interested in joining him at the club. She said she didn’t want to and wanted to go home so they agreed to share a taxi because her home was en route to Middlesbrough. ‘Once in the taxi the defendant told the driver to take them to Wynyard where he lives.’ During the journey, Bramble is accused of assaulting her. Premier League star: Bramble playing for Sunderland in a match against Blackburn at the Stadium of Light . Mr Dodds said: ‘He leaned across and tried to kiss her but she said “no”. He then placed his hand on her leg and moved it towards her crotch. She grabbed his arm and pulled it off.’ He continued: ‘He (Bramble) then grabbed the girl’s right hand and put it on his crotch. She pulled her hand away and said this is not right, stop. He didn’t listen and did the same again. ‘The taxi driver became aware that something was going on inside the back of his taxi because the girl leaned forward and was pulling on his arm pleading with him quietly that she wanted to be taken home.’ It was then he decided to take the pair straight to Stockton police station. Bramble denies four charges of sexual assault. He says any sexual activity in the back of the taxi was consensual. The trial continues.","Concerned cabbie drove pair straight to police station .

Racy: Des Moines Superintendent Nancy Sebring resigned after sending sexually explicit emails from her work account to a lover . The married superintendent of a school district has left her job after dozens of racy emails to her lover were discovered in her work email account. Nancy Sebring, 57, sent the emails to the unidentified man between March 26 and May 8. More than a quarter of the exchanges were sexually explicit. The school official, from Des Moines, Iowa made reference to sex acts and nude photos in the messages. District officials had read the emails which were sent between the couple using a school laptop and iPad. President of the school board Teree Caldwell-Johnson told the Des Moines Register she was 'sorely disappointed'. In one email, Sebring told her lover that she looked at a naked picture of him during the day 'which gets my heart racing a bit'. In the illicit notes she writes: 'I'm filled with nervous energy, which I attribute to being consumed with the desire to put my body next to yours with nothing but your tattoos between us and [blank] until we have nothing left to give.' In another email, she calls the man 'an amazing gift' whom she will 'treasure'. She continues in a longer passage: 'I've become addicted to everything about your smile, your crazy colorful body, your kisses, your [blank]! 'Of course I don't want you to think that sex is all I think about when it comes to you. In fact, I have been thinking that some ''vertical'' time together would be very nice.' In another exchange from April 2 this year, Mrs Sebring wrote: 'Have I told you what an incredible sexy man you are? Right now I am thinking about every inch of your body (including your [blank]).' The . school district does not allow the use of work email for personal . exchanges. Sending messages of a sexual nature is also banned. Sebring sent some the emails, which often rambled on for pages, while she was at work while others were sent in the middle of the night. Illicit: Sebring, who is married, sent around 40 emails over six weeks to her lover . The 57-year-old, who earns $206,178 a year, told the school board she had made mistakes and that she was sorry. She said the affair had lasted about a month with the man who was not a school employee. She was due to leave her position on June 30 but came to an agreement with the school board that she would terminate her contract early.

A British charity worker rescued in a dramatic SAS raid in Afghanistan was hours from being executed. David Cameron ordered crack soldiers to storm remote caves where Helen Johnston was being held after receiving intelligence the kidnappers planned to sell her to the Taliban. All four captors guarding Miss Johnston, 28, were killed in seconds during the ‘surgical’ strike by 28 Special Forces troops. Safe and sound: Rescued British hostage Helen Johnston arrives in Kabul following her kidnap ordeal . Military chiefs pinpointed the location – a place known as the  Valley of the Ants – after a US Predator drone ‘locked on’ to electronic signals from one of the hostages’ mobile phones. The Prime Minister authorised the raid amid fears the gang were preparing to kill Miss Johnston and her three female colleagues or hand them over to hardline insurgents. A defence source said: ‘She was in . immediate danger. One option they were looking at was flogging the . hostages on to the Taliban so we couldn’t wait a second longer. ‘If . she had been passed to a more ideologically-motivated group, her life . would have been in even more serious danger. The prospect did not bear . thinking about. Brave: Helen Johnston was freed on Friday after being kidnapped on May 22 in Badakhshan province . ‘Thankfully, everything fell into place for the operation – it was a textbook mission.’ Last night, Miss Johnston was safe and well in the Afghan capital Kabul. In a remarkable show of fortitude, the nutritionist – who has spoken to her family in Britain – is considering continuing her aid work in Afghanistan. Mr Cameron called Miss Johnston, from Stoke Newington in East London, after she arrived at the British Embassy. The Prime Minister hailed the  soldiers who took part in the ‘extraordinarily brave, breath-taking operation’. In a warning to terrorists, he added: ‘If they take British citizens as hostage, they can expect a swift and brutal end.’ Following the rescue in the early hours of Saturday, Miss Johnston’s family said in a statement: ‘We are delighted and hugely relieved by the wonderful news that Helen and all her colleagues have been freed. ‘We are deeply grateful to everyone involved in her rescue.’ The ordeal began on May 22 when Miss Johnston, Kenyan medic Moragwe Oirere, 26, and two Afghan women were snatched at gunpoint as they travelled on horseback in Badakhshan, a lawless province in north-east Afghanistan. The women, employed by Swiss non-governmental organisation Medair, were visiting flood victims. Rescue: The dramatic raid took place at 2am in Shahr-e-Bozorgd district, in a large forested area near the Tajikistan border called Koh-e-Laran . The bandits, a criminal gang in contact with Taliban fighters, demanded a £7million ransom and the release from jail of a colleague held for murder and drugs. They threatened to kill the hostages, prompting the Government’s emergency committee Cobra, which met each day during the crisis, to draw up rescue plans. But the breakthrough came when military chiefs got an ‘electronic lock’ on to signals from one of the hostages’ mobile phones before its battery lost power. This meant they could pinpoint the exact location of the captives to a cave network inside the Koh-e-Laram forest,  close to the border with Tajikistan. Special Forces ‘eyes on the ground’ were monitoring the gang’s movements, although it is not clear if the troops were British or American. Relieved: David Cameron gave the go-ahead for this morning's rescue of Helen Johnson, who had been working for a Swiss-based aid organisation . Kidnappers' lair: Aid worker Helen Johnston was held in a cave-dwelling complex . Fears for the women’s safety heightened on Wednesday when a member of the Taliban was overheard in an intercepted mobile phone conversation urging the kidnappers to put on a ‘show of intent’. This was interpreted by military chiefs that at least one hostage could be executed on video to increase pressure on negotiators. The SAS mission was given the go-ahead by the Prime Minister at an emergency meeting in London at 3pm on Friday. Heroic: The SAS were helicoptered to the cave where the hostages were being held and stormed it, killing the kidnappers and releasing all four captives alive . Wearing night-vision goggles, the troops watched the caves until two kidnappers emerged. They were shot dead with silenced weapons, and the soldiers entered the cave and shot the two remaining guards. None of the soldiers was injured. The hostages, all unharmed, were airlifted to safety in RAF helicopters. A simultaneous raid by US troops on a cave network nearby left another seven gang members dead. A military source said: ‘This was a classic operation. All the bases were covered and it was executed brilliantly. The strike was made with surgical precision.’ Dead of night: Troops stormed the cave at 1am, in a bid to surprise the hostage takers while they were asleep .

Stephen Martin, 31, was running in the Bay to Breakers race with a group of friends – in lighthearted fun, they had all dressed up as Troll dolls with outlandish wigs. But Martin and another man entered a confrontation, and with a single punch, Martin was in a coma. Now police are again pleading with those who may have seen or recorded the confrontation, asking for photos and videos taken at the event. Scroll down for video . Desperate hunt: San Francisco police are asking for any photos and video from the Bay to Breakers race where Stephen Martin was ultimately killed . Mystery man: Martin, far right, and his friends dressed as Troll dolls; police are seeking the identity of the man in the white 49ers jersey, far left, as a possible suspect . Suspect: Martin was standing with his friends in the Sharon Meadows area of Golden Gate Park hours after the race . The race, which is run by thousands of Bay Area residents annually during the third week of May, is supposed to be a day of fun, where runners traverse 12km across the city and end in Golden Gate Park. Tragic: Martin's family said they allowed 'nature to take its course' after taking him off life support . It is a long-standing tradition to wear outlandish costumes. But the blithe afternoon took a tragic turn as Martin, who was standing with his friends in the Sharon Meadows area of Golden Gate Park hours after the race, had a confrontation with another person, apparently over a cell phone. According to San Francisco Police Cmdr. John Loftus, a confrontation ensued with a group of 12 men and women - some wearing white and red San Francisco 49ers jerseys. Martin was dressed as a troll in a green wig. San Jose Mercury News reports that the punch knocked Martin down onto the pavement, where he hit the back of his head. He never regained consciousness. Police were not sure if the group wearing 49ers jerseys had participated in the race. Martin was in a coma for the three weeks following the incident. His family released a statement after his death saying: 'As per the doctor's recommendation, we took him off life support Friday morning - and allowed nature to take its course. 'Thank you all for your prayers and support.’ On Monday, Police Chief Greg Suhr and top police brass pleaded publicly to those who might have taken photos or videos near the area of the May 20 attack to contact them. 'We can't get enough,' Mr Suhr said. 'Err on the side of caution. If you think you have a photo or video that may be at all helpful, please send it along. ... Let us make the decision on whether it is useful or not.' Scene of the crime: The attack happened near this path in Golden Gate Park . Expansive: Golden Gate Park consists of 1017 acres of public grounds and is the third most visited park in the U.S. Mr Loftus showed photos of Martin and his friends posing with some of the alleged suspects before the altercation, including one man with a Niners jersey and a SF tattoo on the right side of his neck and a woman wearing an orange tutu. Mr Loftus said the suspects may be involved in a gang. 'We're trying to get photos of the actual assault,' he said in a press conference. 'We want to identify all of the people in this photograph. They are all people of interest.' He added, 'This is a tragic crime. This gentleman finished running the Bay to Breakers race several hours before and was socializing with this group, and now he's dead.' The 12-kilometer annual race from the city's Financial District to Golden Gate Park is infamous for its wild costumes, nudity and daylong revelry. In recent years, police have cracked down on runners drinking during the spectacle. This year's race drew more than 40,000 participants, some of whom were dressed as penguins, superheroes and fruit. About 19 people were arrested that day.

She was not seen by a doctor for six hours after going to hospital suffering from bleeding and was then sent home . A grieving mother blames a hospital’s 'human error' for the death of her unborn baby. Georgina Seamons and husband James Rogers lost their son Edward in the 37th week of pregnancy. On February 9 the first-time mum experienced bleeding and visited Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Woolwich, south London, at 4.30am. She was not seen by a doctor until 10.30am and was not sent for a scan until the following day. Mrs Seamons, 24, was sent home on February 11. She was told everything was fine as she had stopped bleeding. The children's charity worker from London, said: 'They couldn’t tell me what had happened. 'From the moment I got into the bed to the moment I left we were asking what’s wrong and I was asking to be induced. 'But they kept saying it was best for the baby to stay in me longer.' On February 13 Mrs Seamons went back to the hospital after she started bleeding and was given an ultra sound where she was told her baby had died in the womb. Three months later Mrs Seamons and her GP received a letter from consultant gynaecologist and obstetrician, Nigel Perks, which stated: 'Clearly, it is a matter of huge regret that we did not delivery her before the second bleed and this is obviously very difficult for the couple to deal with.' Mrs Seamons said: 'In the post mortem report they actually say there was nothing wrong with him. 'He was the right size and his organs were fine. It’s human error that my son is dead.' She added: 'If they had just listened to me he would still be here, but how could I have argued with medical staff? 'It’s just a nightmare that me and my partner had to go through. 'We understand unfortunately women do have still births but they haven’t given us consistent answers.' Mrs Seamons has sent a letter of complaint to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Woolwich, London, about her treatment . Mrs Seamons has sent a letter of complaint to the hospital, her local MP David Evennett and David Cameron. She said: 'I want to make sure other women don’t go through what I went through. 'When you go to hospital make sure you demand answers. Don’t leave until you are satisfied and don’t let them palm you off like they did to me.' She added: 'I used to think they were good and would look after me but after everything that’s gone on I was just another number on a piece of paper to them. 'I don’t ever want to step foot in that hospital again.' A South London Healthcare NHS Trust spokesman said: 'We are deeply sorry for the distress caused and are undertaking a thorough investigation into whether there were any actions we could have taken, mindful of the information we had at the time, which could have prevented the still birth of this baby. 'We are due to meet with Mrs Seamons in the next week and we hope this will be beneficial.' The trust points out the number of serious incidents in the maternity service dropped by more than half in the past year to just over 0.2 incidents per 100 deliveries in 2010/2011, which makes its service the third safest among London trusts.",The couple lost their son Edward in the 37th week of pregnancy .
"PM said he had considered ‘two or . three others’ – including former BBC journalist Guto Harri – for the . job . By . James Chapman . PUBLISHED: . 18:56 EST, 14 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 19:47 EST, 14 June 2012 . David Cameron admitted yesterday his decision to hire former News of the World editor Andy Coulson had ‘haunted’ them both. The Prime Minister faced repeated questioning at the Leveson Inquiry over the assurances he sought from Mr Coulson about his knowledge of phone hacking at the paper before appointing him as his director of communications. He said he had considered ‘two or three others’ – including former BBC journalist Guto Harri – for the job, but hired Mr Coulson in 2007 as ‘the only tabloid editor available’. David Cameron admitted yesterday his decision to hire former News of the World editor Andy Coulson had 'haunted' them both . He insisted he, his chief of staff . Ed Llewellyn and Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude sought assurances . from Mr Coulson, who resigned from the newspaper over the hacking . scandal. ‘Why did I feel he deserved a second chance? Because I thought that he had done the honourable thing. Something very bad had happened on the newspaper he was editing. He did not know and he resigned,’ Mr Cameron told the inquiry into media ethics. ‘There were some people in the Conservative Party who would have said, “Don’t have a tabloid editor”. My view was that it was necessary to have someone tough and robust.’ The PM said he had considered 'two or three others' - including former BBC journalist Guto Harri (above) - for the job, but hired Mr Coulson in 2007 as 'the only tabloid editor available' Mr Coulson – who resigned in January last  year and is now facing perjury charges in Scotland as well as being on bail in relation to allegations of phone hacking – had given similar assurances that he knew nothing of phone hacking to the police, Press Complaints Commission and the  Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, which had all ‘accepted his word’, he added. ‘So, yes, I accepted these undertakings but so did many other people and organisations... I just make one point, because I recognise this is a controversial appointment. ‘This has come back to haunt both him and me, but in doing the job of director of communication for the party and in Downing Street he did the job very effectively.’ Confirming that Chancellor George Osborne had thought the appointment was a ‘good idea’, the Prime Minister insisted the fact that Mr Coulson worked at and had close links with the Murdoch media empire had been irrelevant. The Cabinet Office also testified that Mr Coulson was the first Downing Street communications director of recent times not to have been properly security vetted. All six previous incumbents  had received so-called ‘developed  vetting’ – the most thorough such procedure – within seven months of taking the job. But Mr Cameron dismissed accusations he had been lax in checking Mr Coulson out and said the whole issue was a ‘red herring’. The PM yesterday voiced his opposition to statutory regulation of newspapers, telling Lord Justice Leveson (above) it would lead to 'real concerns' that the freedom of the Press could be compromised . Cameron: Why Press must be self-regulated . The Prime Minister yesterday voiced his opposition to statutory regulation of newspapers, telling Lord Justice Leveson it would lead to ‘real concerns’ that the freedom of the Press could be compromised. Instead, Mr Cameron advocated a ‘genuinely independent’ form of self-regulation ‘with teeth’, saying such a system would be ‘fantastic’. And he told the inquiry the existing Press Complaints Commission under its new chief Lord Hunt should be given the chance to draw up this tougher, more accountable regime. In what was seen as a clear rejection of some of the more draconian proposals floated during the inquiry, he said: ‘The Press and people who, like me, care about a free Press, have a real concern about ... full-on statutory regulation. We have to understand the real concern there is about statutory regulation. 'That doesn’t mean you rule it out, but it means try and make everything that can be independent work before you reach for that lever. ‘I worked in television where we had statutory regulation. Newspapers are different, and we have to respect that and understand that, so if we can make a self-regulatory system work that is genuinely independent, that would be fantastic.’ The Prime Minister said the new regulator should have the power to dish out significant penalties to organisations which flout the rules. These would include ‘front page apologies’ for damaging or inaccurate stories, and the possibility of hefty fines. He also rejected a proposal to outlaw the blurring of news and comment in newspapers. That idea, advanced by Lord Justice Leveson, has been described as dangerous by several serving politicians, who believe it would lead to government effectively engaging in censorship. Mr Cameron fired another warning shot, saying: ‘I think it’s quite impractical. So often a headline encapsulates both a fact but also an opinion. It happens and I think it’s rather a forlorn hope to think you can somehow separate them.’ Mr Cameron’s views have been echoed by his fellow party leaders Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband, and Cabinet members George Osborne, Michael Gove and Theresa May. The PM said the new system would have to be adhered to by every newspaper group and suggested that those who fail to sign up – such as the Express group, which pulled out of the PCC – could face a range of sanctions, including expulsion from the Parliamentary Lobby. He said the system could be ‘effectively compulsory’ if No10 said: ‘If you’re not part of this, you’re not in the lobby, you don’t get any information from Government’. He praised the ‘good ideas’ of Tory peer Lord Hunt, who has been working on plans to give ordinary people greater redress over stories they object to. And the PM said it was right that ‘those of us who put ourselves in the public eye’ expect more scrutiny, pointing to a recent revelation about his own family. ‘They could probably safely leave their children in the pub and not have the same focus on them – which I do not complain about at all.’","Cameron repeatedly questioned at Leveson Inquiry over assurances he sought from .

It's the most exclusive guesthouse in America - the Washington guesthouse that only former Presidents and their partners can stay in. The four-storey clubhouse opposite the White House which was built in the 1970s for former leader Lyndon B Johnson to stay in, has thrown open its doors for the first time. Despite its famous guests, the accommodation in the brownstone property is relatively modest - and former first lady Barbara Bush once described it as a 'dump'. It has since undergone a complete refit. President's club: The dining room with eight chairs around it in the clubhouse residence which is opposite the White House . Bathroom: A large bath and a fireplace in the main bathroom in the property which former Presidents have stayed in down the years . Throughout the property the Presidential Seal features prominently - and is embossed on the duvet cover of the large white double bed in one of the two bedrooms. There is an impressive bathroom complete with a fireplace and a large office to work in. The four living ex-Presidents - Jimmy Carter, George Bush Snr, Bill Clinton and George Bush Jnr - are the only men who are allowed to stay. However, as there have been a series of relatively young Presidents in recent years the number of members of the very exclusive club is likely to grow. Office: A desk and a bookcase full of volumes in the Presidential clubhouse. However, there is no computer . Club members: George W. Bush and Bill Clinton who are among the only four men eligible to stay in the four-storey Presidential clubhouse opposite the White House . Presidents: George Bush Snr frequently stayed in the clubhouse when Bill Clinton was President - but stayed in the White House when his son was in charge. Jimmy Carter, right, is the fourth member of the unique group . The smart formal dining room is almost as nice as the one in the White House just over the road. A series of photographs and paintings adorn the walls throughout the spacious property - including a portrait of Thomas Jefferson in the dining room. Although George Bush Snr frequently stayed in the clubhouse when Clinton was President, when his son was in charge he stayed in the White House. The doors to the clubhouse were thrown open to CBS News for the first time as a new book is published. Bedroom: A large double-bed with a duvet cover which is embossed with the Presidential seal of office . Sitting room: Two tables in the four-storey brownstone property which was refitted after former first lady Barbara Bush branded it a 'dump' Michael Duffy, who has-co-authored The President's Club with Nancy Gibbs, told CBS: 'The reason this overnight guest house exists goes back to Dick Nixon. He keeps getting phone calls from Johnson in Texas who is restless in his ranch and he keeps wanting to come to Washington. 'That is why this here - it was Nixon trying to keep Lyndon Johnson happy.' The author added that Presidents have formed some unlikely alliances with former holders of the office. For example, Bill Clinton received a lot of advice from Richard Nixon. Mr Duffy added: 'Nixon really wanted to get to know Clinton. He wanted to . be sort of a secret behind the scenes adviser. He became that. Clinton . turned out to rely on him for a great deal of advice.' He said that the unique experiences Presidents had meant they were often able to form a close bond. 'You come out of this job with so many scars that only you know about there,' he said. 'There . are only a few people who understand what those scars are like and . maybe a relationship with someone like that can take you to a place . where no one else can.'

Witness: Tom Crowe, 18, told the court how the accused, Elliot Turner, 'practised strangling him' The son of a wealthy jeweller accused of strangling his girlfriend in bed had practised the technique on his friend just days earlier, a court heard today. Elliot Turner, 20, allegedly killed aspiring model Emily Longley, 17, in a jealous rage at his parents’ home before they allegedly helped him cover up the murder. Today his friend Tom Crowe, 18, told the court that days before the blonde teenager’s death, Turner practised strangling him so hard 'he started to panic'. He also said that before Emily was killed, Turner even claimed he had already murdered her by clubbing her round the head with a hammer. The jury has heard Turner became jealous because he suspected she had been having affairs during their four month relationship. Mr Crowe said: 'Elliot and me had gone to a local park and he was saying Emily had really done it this time and was seeing other blokes. 'He said: ""How shall I do it Tom? How shall I kill her, mate?"" 'He looked lively and was taking short paces. I said: ""I wouldn’t know, I’m not a murderer."" 'He was coming up with ideas about whether he should set her on fire with petrol in his bedroom or drown her. 'My reaction was to think: ""Christ, you’re nuts. That’s insane"". 'He also mentioned a drugs overdose or whether she would choke on her own vomit if she got really drunk. 'Then we were joking around and having some horse play when we started wrestling. 'I gave a demonstration of how wrestlers strangle each other on the TV show Smack Down but I couldn’t get my arm around his neck. 'He is very muscular, powerful and strong because he drinks protein shakes and goes to the gym. 'He took hold of me the same way and put a lot of pressure on my throat and I started to panic.

He . then allegedly left a message on a friend’s voicemail saying: 'She . changed it to her flirting with some other lads and made me look like a . knob.' Mr Crowe referred to Turner and their group of social friends as ‘The Firm'. He added that on April 30 Turner told friends he had battered Emily six or seven times in the head with a hammer and killed her. He . said: 'Elliot said he found out Emily was going to a nightclub on a . date with another boy, Louis Powell, by looking through her Facebook and . phone messages. 'We drove . to Klute mightclub in Bournemouth and on the way he was very angry and . aggressive, banging the steering wheel and speeding.

A husband arrived home to find his wife murdered, stabbed in the back in what police are investigating as a home invasion robbery gone wrong. The body of Simeonette Mapes-Crupi, 29, a New York City social studies teacher, was found on Thursday afternoon by her husband Jonathan, 30, at their home on Staten Island. Reports said that Mrs Mapes-Crupi was found face-down with several stab wounds in her back by the door to their apartment. Couple: Simeonette Mapes-Crupi was found dead by her husband Jonathan in their Staten Island condo on Thursday afternoon . The murder occurred in a quiet, tree-lined street in New Springville, across from a golf course where neighbours say crime is scarce. Police told the Staten Island Advance that there did not appear to be any signs of forced entry at the home, which had been ransacked. The murder has left the community in shock. As news of the murder spread, numerous onlookers gathered around the couple's apartment, which had been sealed off by police tape. Local resident Gabrielle Blinderman, 19, told the Advance: 'I don't think anything has really happened like that [in the past].' Neighbours reported that they didn’t see or hear anything suspicious until her husband made the horrific discovery. One onlooker, who declined to be identified, told the New York Daily News: 'He’s like, ""She’s dead! I came home! It was hot! She was dead! Area: Mrs Mapes-Crupi's body was found near the door of the couple's apartment in this condo complex on Staten Island . 'She’s dead! She’s dead! It was hot! I wasn’t here. I had to work!""' Another witness told the paper that he came out of the home screaming, 'My wife was murdered!' Another neighbour, Rachel Havia, 43, said the victim had recently celebrated her birthday, adding: 'Her husband brought her flowers and balloons.' Another woman, who works nearby and who came across a large crowd on her lunch break, said: 'At first I thought it was a fight. 'Then I thought someone was hurt, because they were like hugging and crying, and people were screaming.' Gabrielle Blinderman, 19, called the murder 'surreal'. She said: 'I don't think anything has really happened like that in the past'. Her friend Chris Tobias, 18, added: 'That's terrible.' Linda Tanen also said that the idea that it could have been a random home invasion was especially frightening. She added: 'Nothing happens here. You're across the street from a golf course, and all you have is people golfing. Everybody is in their own world.' Mrs Mapes-Crupi was a teacher since 2009 at an East New York high school called School for Classics: An Academy of Thinkers, Writers and Performers . It is described as a 'tough' high . school, where her husband also teaches English. Last month, she received . a Master of Science degree in adolescent education from the College of . Staten Island, according to Advance records. Just last week, Mrs Crupi spoke of a scary incident when she posted on Facebook that she and her husband had witnessed a shootout near the school they teach at. She wrote on June 28: ‘[My husband] and I survived a shoot out today...Thank God we are ok, I'm sure over summer school we'll find out what the fighting was about' 'To all the wanna be gangstas of Staten Island (who say they are from Brooklyn but really aren't), be grateful you have what you have and stop trying to live a lifestyle you will never understand.'

"By . Emily Allen . PUBLISHED: . 11:01 EST, 17 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:35 EST, 17 April 2012 . Researchers found a big increase in anger and fear head of last summer's riots . British scientists are using Twitter to gauge the nation’s mood, it has been revealed. Researchers at Bristol University studied nearly 500 million tweets by ten million users of the social network between the summer of 2009 and early 2012, a period marked by economic downturn and social tension. They found a big increase in negative mood, anger and fear, coinciding with the announcement of spending cuts and last summer’s riots together with a calming effect of Prince William’s wedding to Kate Middleton. In the study the researchers focused . on measuring the mood, and changes, using standard tools for mood . detection, of a large sample of the UK population. A . collection of 484 million tweets generated by more than 9.8 million . users from the UK were analysed between July 2009 and January 2012. The findings reveal intriguing patterns that can be explained when events and social changes are taken into account. The researchers found that a significant increase in negative mood indicators coincided with the announcement of the cuts to public spending by the government, and that this effect is still lasting. They also detected events such as the riots of summer 2011, as well as a possible calming effect in the run up to the Royal Wedding. A rise in public anger seems to have already been under way in the days before the riots. Researchers at Bristol University found Prince William's wedding to Kate Middleton had a calming effect according to tweets . Study co-author Nello Cristianini, professor of artificial intelligence at Bristol University, said: 'Social media allows for the easy gathering of large amounts of data generated by the public while communicating with each other. 'While we leave the interpretation of our findings to social and political scientists, we observed how the period preceding the royal wedding seems to be marked by a lowered incidence of anger and fear, which starts rising soon after that. Of course, other events also happened in early May 2011, so they may also be responsible for that increase.' The aim of the study was to see if the effects of social events could be seen in the contents of Twitter. A collection of 484 million tweets generated by more than 9.8 million users from the UK were analysed between July 2009 and January 2012 . The first part of the analysis backs up the researchers’ theory that word-counting methods can provide a reasonable approach to sentiment or mood analysis. By making use of lists of words that are correlated with the sentiments of joy, fear, anger and sadness, they observed that periodic events such as Christmas, Valentine’s Day and Halloween evoke the same response in the population, year after year. The main part of the analysis focused on a visible change-point occurring in October 2010, when the government announced cuts to public spending. The study showed that public mood has still not recovered from that announcement. The same testing technique shows another important period, that of summer 2011, when riots broke out in various UK cities, leading to looting and even loss of life. The researchers method seems to suggest that some increase in public anger preceded, and not followed, these events, although the significance of this finding is a matter for social scientists to discuss. Future work will include the comparison with social media content with traditional media content, as well as the comparison of both with traditional opinion polls methods.

Hundreds of thousands of families are set to be offered tax breaks on so-called 'granny flats' under plans to ease the housing crisis. The Government is expected to abolish council tax on these annexes, typically used by householders to home older members of their family. Ministers are also considering overhauling planning regulations and fees to make it easier for people to convert garages and other outbuildings into 'granny flats'. At present, residents are required to pay council tax on both their main home and any annex they own. Tax break: The Government is looking to abolish council tax on annexes dubbed granny flats . Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said the existing taxation regime was 'fundamentally unfair'. 'We are keen to remove tax and other regulatory obstacles to families having a live-in annexe for immediate relations,' he told the Daily Telegraph. More... Record high of 4m homes where no one goes to work blamed on recession and benefits . House prices 'stable' but market still suffering from lack of supply, says Nationwide . 'We should support home owners who want to improve their properties and standard of living. 'These reforms should also play a role in increasing the housing supply.” At present, granny flats are treated as separate dwellings and, as such, can be charged full rates of council tax by local authorities, which often exceed £1,000 a year. Government officials believe the change could benefit as many as 300,000 households in England. Reforms:  Communities Secretary Eric Pickles says cutting council tax on annexes could help increase housing supply.  However, shadow communities secretary Hilary Benn says the move is 'cynical spinning' The reforms, which would likely require legislation, are expected to form part of a raft of policies to address the nationwide shortage of affordable homes over the next two years. Ministers have already supported plans to encourage pensioners to downsize and allow local authorities to rent out their homes. It is believed that as many as 25 million bedrooms in England may currently be empty. Annexes do not presently need to have a front door to be counted as a separate dwelling, although they are required to have distinct living and sleeping quarters, plus a bathroom and a kitchen. The Government is also planning to review existing legislation to make it easier for home owners to adapt properties. Granny flats are self-contained annexes, built as extensions an existing residential property . They derive their name from the fact that many of these annexes are occupied by pensioners who downsize in their retirement to be closer to their children or other relatives . At present, a granny flat is not required to have a front door to be treated as a separate dwelling, although they would need to have their own bathroom and kitchen . Currently, these annexes are liable to council tax, typically around £1,000 a year . This means that, at present, householders who own a granny flat are required to pay council tax on both their main property and the annex . At the moment, garage conversions need planning permission and Whitehall officials believe too many councils refuse to approve such schemes. The housing review will also consider axing the need for residents to pay for planning agreements on how the annexes would be used, which can cost more than £1,000. “Such a policy would make it easier for families to expand their homes and offer accommodation to extended families, without the hassle and cost of moving home,” a Whitehall source said. Ros Altmann, the director-general of the over-50s group Saga, told the Daily Telegraph that the reforms could be a 'benefit' for families that would otherwise find it difficult to afford the cost of care for relations. She did, however, warn that the elderly should not be forced to move out of their own homes. Labour said it was unclear who would benefit from any further relaxation of the tax rules as annexes occupied by dependants aged over 65 are already exempt. Such a move would also reduce the income of local councils at a time when town halls are already being forced to implement severe spending cuts. Shadow communities secretary Hilary Benn said: ""This is a decidedly peculiar claim by Eric Pickles as occupied 'granny flats' have been exempt from council tax since 1997. 'It is therefore extremely unclear exactly which pensioners the Government expects to benefit from these changes, and the granny tax fiasco doesn't give us confidence that they will get this right. 'This cynical spinning shows that once again the Tory-led Government are over-claiming and under-delivering for our nation's pensioners. 'This seems to be nothing more than an attempt to deflect attention from their housing crisis. 'What we need is to get building and get the economy moving again. 'That's why Labour is proposing to build 25,000 new affordable homes and a temporary cut to the rate of VAT.' Under the 1997 regulations, council tax is not paid on annexes occupied by relatives who are over 65, mentally impaired, or substantially and permanently disabled. A spokesman for Mr Pickles said the proposal was to extend the exemption to allow annexes inhabited by any family member, not just pensioners, to be free from council tax. No decision had been taken on whether town halls would be compensated by central government for the lost revenue, he said. Housing minister Grant Shapps added: 'We should support homeowners who want to improve their properties and standard of living. 'At every opportunity Labour want to find a way of raiding the pockets of the public.'","Ministers believe the move could help to increase housing supply .

The second-largest U.S. movie theater chain has been bought by a Chinese company today in a historic takeover. AMC Entertainment Holdings was sold for $2.6 billion to Dalian Wanda Group Company in a setback to President Obama's attempts to prevent American businesses being eclipsed by their Chinese rivals. Wanda said the deal would create the world's biggest movie theater operator and the Beijing-based company revealed it would invest an additional $500 million in AMC's development. One to watch: Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda Group Company has bought AMC movie theaters for $2.6 billion . AMC operates 346 cinemas, mostly in the United States and Canada, and has 23 of the 50 highest-grossing U.S. outlets. The multi-billion dollar deal undermines President Obama's promises to re-stimulate the economy at home. Following his State of the Union address in January, Obama told a manufacturing plant in Iowa: 'We need to make it easier for American businesses to do business here in America.' In February, the President urged Congress to adopt tax proposals that reward technology companies and other businesses that create jobs in the U.S. rather than overseas. He said: 'Companies... are realizing that even when we can’t make things cheaper than China, we can make things better. That’s how we’re going to compete globally.' At a signing ceremony for the deal in Beijing today, Wanda chairman Wang Jianlin said: 'We support AMC becoming bigger, not only in the United States but in the global market.' Shake on it: Gerry Lopez, CEO of AMC Entertainment Holdings (left) shakes hands with Zhang Lin, Vice President of Wanda during a signing ceremony in Beijing today . Golden age of cinema: The Chinese firm has given reassurances that AMC headquarters will remain in Kansas and some 18,500 jobs at the company protected . There has been increased Chinese investment in U.S. corporate assets despite disputes between the two governments over trade and political issues, such as this month's diplomatic standoff over a blind Chinese legal activist Chen Guangcheng who arrived in New York on Saturday. The AMC deal is the largest-ever takeover of a U.S. company by a Chinese company. In terms of all Chinese corporate investments in the U.S., the deal is the third largest, according to financial research firm Dealogic. It ranks behind investments by Beijing's sovereign wealth fund, the China Investment Corp., of $5 billion for a minority stake in Morgan Stanley and $3 billion in Blackstone Group LP, both in 2007. Chinese companies had invested $34.8 billion in the United States by the end of 2011 in industries including auto parts, agriculture and steelmaking, according to data compiled by economist Derek Scissors at the Heritage Foundation, Washington. The company began in 1920 when three brothers Maurice, Edward and Barney Dubinsky purchased the Regent Theater in Kansas City, Missouri. After changing the family name, it became known as Durwood Theaters which grew into a chain across Kansas City. The company designed the first multiplex theater in the world in 1963. Five years later, the multi-screen had expanded nationwide and became American Multi-Cinema (AMC). AMC introduced other firsts - the armchair cup holder and stadium seating. It is the second-largest movie chain in the U.S. after the Regal Entertainment Group. AMC has 346 locations and 18,500 staff. Globally, outbound mergers and acquisitions by Chinese companies total $16.8 billion so far this year, up 6 per cent from the same period last year. Wanda said AMC's headquarters will remain in the Kansas City area and day-to-day operations will not change. AMC's management would remain in place and staff numbers were not expected to be affected. The company employs some 18,500 people. Wanda, founded in 1988 and privately owned, operates hotels, department stores, tourism and other businesses and reported a 2011 revenue of $16.7 billion. The company employs 50,000 people and its assets include 86 theaters in China. AMC's owners include Apollo Global Management, Bain Capital, the Carlyle Group, CCMP Capital Advisors and Spectrum Equity Investors. AMC has reported losses for the past three years but iCEO Gerry Lopez said it has returned to profit this year due to strong ticket sales. Mr Wang, the Wanda chairman, said AMC's financial problems were due to the cost of servicing high debt. He said conditions should improve once an injection of Wanda's cash allows it to pay off some of that. He said: 'We are confident that after the merger, AMC will turn positive. We have absolute confidence in the future of the company.' Pastime: The exterior of the AMC Grand in Dallas, Texas. The chain will now be owned by the Dalian Wanda Group which wants to expand into hotels and other leisure businesses in the U.S. Wanda's investment will allow AMC to speed up renovation of some cinemas and install more 3-D and IMAX technology, Lopez said. Wang and Lopez said the two companies plan to share experience in the film business and will have executives from each country visit the other. Lopez said they have not made detailed plans about such things as a possible exchange of staff. Lopez is to join the board of directors of Wanda's cinema unit, while a Wanda executive will join AMC's board, Wang said. Wang said Wanda was considering more acquisitions abroad for its entertainment, hotel and retail units. He said it might try to buy into a global hotel brand or a hotel management company but gave no details. 'We want to be a big company, not just in China but in the world,' he said.

Afghanistan could slip back into the hands of extremists and pose  a terrorist threat to  the West when British troops leave, experts have warned. David Cameron claimed at a Nato summit yesterday that plans for withdrawal by the end of December 2014 are ‘on track and on target’. Barack Obama went even further, declaring that the allies would soon be able to say: ‘The Afghan war as we know it is over.’ 'The war is over': President Barack Obama, accompanied by Prime Minister David Cameron, speaking during the meeting on Afghanistan during the NATO Summit in Chicago yesterday . But despite those optimistic statements, the US commander of Nato’s troops said they would have to fight their way out of the country. A senior British official also conceded that it was ‘unrealistic’ to assume Afghanistan ‘is going to be completely secure’ or that there would be ‘no possiblity of a terrorist threat re-emerging’. With this in mind, up to 200 members of the SAS will remain to take on Al Qaeda into 2015. The admission raises questions about whether Britain’s deployment in Afghanistan, designed to deprive the terrorist group of a safe haven, has been worth the thousands of injuries and 414 fatalities suffered by the Armed Forces. Unified front: Mr Cameron also claimed at the summit yesterday that plans for withdrawal from Afghanistan by the end of December 2014 are 'on track and on target' All smiles: Mr Obama greets participants during the Meeting with Partners event at the Nato Summit. Despite his remarks, experts warned that it was unrealistic to expect Afghanistan to be completely free of terrorism . Yesterday’s summit was designed to set out a final timetable for the handover to Afghan security forces, which will lead all combat operations by mid-2013. General John Allen said he ‘fully expects that combat  is going to continue’ past  that milestone. ‘There is no end of combat before the end of 2014,’ he added. ‘And in fact, the Taliban will oppose the Afghan National Security Forces after 2014.’ He went on to warn that Nato may need to send more troops to Helmand province, where British forces are currently stationed, if extremists seize ground vacated by the allies. Round table: Mr Obama is seen speaking on-screen at the meeting yesterday, which was designed to set out a final timetable for the handover to Afghan security forces, which will lead all combat operations by mid-2013 . Mr Cameron insisted that British troops will have completed their mission and can leave ‘with their heads held high’ – but he conceded that Western leaders would not control the country’s fate. ‘British troops will no longer be in a combat role beyond the end of 2014,’ he said. ‘That is our deadline. And at this summit, Nato confirmed it will be the deadline for the ISAF [International Security Assistance Force] mission. The plan for the transition of full security responsibility from ISAF to the Afghan National Security Forces is on track and on target.’ War torn country: Afghan security forces rush to the site of a battle in Kabul. Even if the withdrawal goes to plan, British taxpayers will bankroll the Afghan security forces for years to come . But he added: ‘There will still be occasions when we are in a combat mode before the end of 2014. It’s very important to make that point to people. ‘What is absolutely within our control is the growth of the Afghan National Security Forces, the capability they have. Clearly there will be a better outcome in Afghanistan if that is accompanied by a political solution as well. That is not fully within our control. ‘But I am confident that our troops can leave with their heads held high having completed the combat task in 2014, because they will be handing over to fully capable Afghan security forces that will be able to deal with any residual problems and issues in a fully capable way. They will have done a great job.’ Unrest: Hundreds of protesters, many affiliated with the Occupy Wall Street movement, demonstrate in front of the Boeing headquarters on the second day of the NATO summit yesterday . Even if the withdrawal goes to plan, British taxpayers will bankroll the Afghan security forces for years to come, starting with a handout of £70million in 2015. Yesterday’s summit saw countries pledge £2.2billion in total, with Britain set to fund an officer training centre dubbed Sandhurst in the Sand. A British source claimed the cost to taxpayers would decline over time. ‘Long-term World Bank projections suggest the Afghans won’t be able to be self-funding until the mid-2020s, but we expect the amount required to fall as the Afghan state continues to develop,’ they said. ‘The UK’s contribution will be reviewed after the first year. This is about ensuring that the Afghans are able to  manage their own security once we leave.’","'The Afghan war as we know it is over,' declares President Obama .

Unassuming: Dorothy O'Grady's neighbours knew her as a guest house landlady whose greatest pleasure was walking her Labrador, Rob . To her neighbours Dorothy O'Grady was a pleasant middle-aged woman who liked walking her Labrador around their sleepy seaside town. So when the unassuming landlady of Osborne Villa in the Isle of Wight was suddenly arrested in 1940 on suspicion of being a Nazi spy, few believed it possible. O'Grady's husband had been sent to London to aid the fire service, the couple's guest house in Sandown had been closed and O'Grady was left to her own devices. The Channel island was flooded with soldiers, military bases and equipment. The neighbours thought O'Grady wandered with dog Rob to stave off the loneliness but the police had their suspicions. They believed O'Grady's dog walks were just a ruse, that in fact she was gathering intelligence into restricted military areas. She was accused of making detailed maps, cutting military telephone wires and wearing a small swastika badge on the underside of her coat lapel. She was tried and convicted in Winchester of betraying her country and became the first British woman to be sentenced to death for treason. She escaped the gallows after her lawyer successfully won an appeal for misdirection of the jury. Instead, she was jailed for 14 years. But tantalizingly, O'Grady's story does not end there. On her release in 1950 she went straight to Fleet Street insisting her 'spying' activities were a bit of fun or a 'lark', as she put it, which got rather out of hand. Shock: But in 1940 O'Grady was charged with being a Nazi spy and sentenced to death. This mugshot is from 1918 after she was arrested for forging bank notes . Why? An extract from O'Grady's detailed map of the Isle of Wight's eastern coastline in 1940 shows she concentrated on the defences in and around Sandown Bay, an area initially earmarked for invasion by Germany . She told the Daily Express that 'the whole thing was a joke', and that she 'looked forward to the trial as an immense thrill'. She said: 'The excitement of being tried for my life was intense... It made me feel somebody instead of being an ordinary seaside landlady.' O'Grady died aged 83 in 1985 and her version of events was generally accepted until 1995. Then her prosecution papers were released and it became plain just how serious a threat she constituted to national security in 1940. Landlady: Pictured last year, this is Osborne Villa, in Sandown, O'Grady's . guest house home at the time of her arrest in 1940. She escaped the gallows and was sentenced to 14 years in prison but returned to the villa on her release in 1950 . Familiar: O'Grady was twice jailed at HMP Aylesbury, once for Borstal training and then in 1941 to serve her wartime crimes sentence. On her second visit the prison psychologist found her to be highly disturbed . The papers said the maps she drew were 'terrifyingly accurate', and 'would be of very great importance to the enemy'. Isle of Wight MP Barry Field had championed her cause, but was shocked when the papers were released. He said: 'I set out to clear her name, but I am staggered by the treachery she sunk to. She could have altered the direction of the war.' But the notion of 'Dotty' Dorothy being just another unhinged fantasist persisted. Now book, The Spy Beside the Sea, based on hitherto unseen reports unearthed by author Adrian Searle has shed new light on the mystery. Keeping watch: O'Grady had made notes on troop movements on the island, including the use of bicycles by the 6th Black Watch . Key area: After war broke out, the Isle of Wight became a key defensive position and thousands of troops were stationed there . Using research by the BBC journalist Peter Hill, Mr Searle began digging into O'Grady's past and uncovered documents that, more than any other, offer the most likely explanation of who Mrs Dorothy O'Grady really was. She had enjoyed a comfortable childhood with her adoptive parents, a British Museum official and his wife, in Clapham, south London. That all ended before her eleventh birthday when her mother died and father married his vindictive housekeeper, who bullied the young Dorothy. In 1918 after a spell in a home for young girls training for a life of domestic service, she was in trouble and well known as a 'thoroughly bad lot'. That year she was sent to borstal after forging banks notes and in 1920 served two years' hard labour for stealing clothes from her employer in Brighton. Timings: This official photograph was taken at Culver Down Battery on 24 August 1940 as O'Grady was compiling maps and drawing sketches of the Isle of Wight's coastal defences . Important: Culver Down Battery's 9.2in guns were an important component in the defence of the island. O'Grady noted their presence on her maps . Spying: In post-war interviews it was clear O'Grady had also been keeping an eye on the nearest of four Solent sea forts at St Helens . Was she working for Hitler? When she was arrested by troops on the island, O'Grady had a swastika badge on the underside of her coat lapel . On her return to London some years later, O'Grady gathered a collection of convictions for prostitution. The fourth saw her locked up in Holloway for three weeks. On her release she married Vincent O'Grady, a London fireman 19 years her senior. And on his retirement the couple moved to the Isle of Wight, but when war broke out in 1939 he was put back into service and she was left alone. The soldiers stationed on the island had at first thought the then 42-year-old O'Grady, who was always hanging around with her dog, was just a nuisance. This map of the Isle of Wight in 1940, shows O’Grady’s close proximity to military installations . East . 1. St Helens (Sea) Fort – searchlights . 2.

She was booked, and ordered to appear before Ryde Magistrates' Court, a hearing which she didn't turn up for. Then, when police arrived at her villa they found it locked. O'Grady had gone on the run. It took three weeks to track her down. In that time she had made more maps, cut phone wires, and, unusually for an undercover agent, offered schoolboys small bribes to tell her about army gun emplacements. Her previous convictions for prostitution and fraud came out in the subsequent trial and this, it was later suggested, was the reason she had gone on the run, fearing her husband would find out. O'Grady was subject to psychological testing at Aylesbury Prison, where she served the majority of her sentence. And the reports into her mental health by the prison governor and psychologist, unearthed by Mr Searle using the Freedom of Information Act, give the most likely explanation of her so-called spying activities. Difficult childhood: The young Dorothy O'Grady almost certainly received her . truncated convent schooling at Convent of Notre Dame in London but by 1918 she was well known as a 'thoroughly bad lot' Criminal career: As well as the conviction for forgery, O'Grady also racked up convictions for stealing clothes and prostitution before being sentenced to death for treason . Death: O'Grady died aged 83 in 1985. This photograph was taken four years before her death while she was living in sheltered housing at Lake, on the Isle of Wight . The Spy Beside the Sea by by Adrian Searle is published on Thursday . According to the governor, O'Grady appeared to be a highly disturbed, and highly intelligent woman with a deep grudge against authority. The reports made clear she regularly self-harmed, and had 'attacks... in which she has to ""obey people"" inside her who encourage her to do harmful acts to herself'. She had enacted a pretend hanging by placing a chair on her cell bed, and sometimes slept naked under the bed. They also noted a sexual dimension to her behaviour, which included tying herself in awkward positions for hours at a time. The prison medical officer Dr Violet Minster reported that O'Grady inserted an alarming collection of objects into her vagina. These included a light bulb, more than 50 pieces of broken glass, a small pot, and 100 pins. In the fascinating book of the story that has remained a mystery for more than 70 years, Mr Searle believes this evidence shows O'Grady was not a spy but a woman who sought the limelight. But, while there is no evidence she ever attempted to communicate her information to anyone in any way, it is not impossible that she was hedging her bets, calculating, perhaps, that if the Nazis invaded, she would be able to prove her loyalty to the new cause.

"By . Stewart Maclean . PUBLISHED: . 08:05 EST, 25 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 01:23 EST, 26 April 2012 . A sailor has been rescued after he spent 78 days lost at sea during a disaster-hit solo voyage from Britain to Australia, it emerged today. Stig Lundvall, 66, was found drifting in the Indian Ocean near South Africa last week, almost three months after a violent storm in January during which his 26ft yacht's mast was destroyed. The Swedish sailor spent more than 11 weeks stranded at sea without communications following the mishap, which happened on January 30 as he attempted to sail from Falmouth in Cornwall to Australia. After 80 days alone at sea in a yacht with a broken mast, 66-year-old Swedish yachtsman Stig Lundvall was rescued by a Greek ship . The rescued boatman told of his relief after he was spotted last Tuesday by a Greek ship as floated around 350 miles off South Africa's coastline. In an interview with the country's Cape Times newspaper, Mr Lundvall said he was down to his last 10 litres of drinking water and had just one emergency flare on board when he spotted the lights of the ship in the distance. He said: 'I had to wait until the last moment. At first I thought the ship didn't see me because it was still passing by. 'But it was a big ship and it is slow to stop. Then I saw it had stopped. It was a good feeling.' Mr Lundvall described how he became stranded on his yacht following a violent thunder storm which smashed his mast. He told the Cape Times he believed he was around 450 nautical miles from South Africa when the freak weather left him without power or communications. Stig had just 10 litres of water left and only one more emergency flare when he saw the lights of a ship in the distance . Stig's boat was hit by a violent storm which smashed his mast off the coast off South Africa . He said: 'It was a very heavy storm that blew up quite quickly in the middle of the night, actually at 3am. 'I was awake because it was impossible to sleep because of the noise. 'I thought it was raining, but it was the spray from the waves against the boat.' The sailor said he was stranded for several days without any power after his mast was damaged before he eventually managed to rig up an emergency sail. The sailor knew the ship would never see his tiny craft a nautical mile away on the dark night sea. He was not even sure it would see his flare . The temporary structure helped him get more control of his yacht but he was still unable to navigate properly. He added: 'With that I could do a little bit of sailing. It took me one or two weeks to get a course but mainly it was just the currents that took me.' Mr Lundvall said last week's encounter with the Greek ship was the third time since the accident that a boat had sailed within sight of his stricken yacht. He had left the UK in early January with three emergency flares on board but used two of them in the hope the earlier boast would rescue him. On both occasions the vessels had failed to spot his signals, leaving him with just one final chance of being rescued. The brave sailor described how he waited until the last moment last week as the ship passed in the distance before setting off the flare. The Greek vessel then turned around and picked him up. Following the rescue Mr Lundvall, from the town of Vasteras west of Stockholm, was taken to the eastern South African port of Richard's Bay. He later flew to Cape Town and has since returned to Sweden. He told the Cape Times that during his ordeal he had lost around three stone (20kg) in weight - most of which was muscle. Stig said he was stranded for several days without any power after his mast was damaged before he eventually managed to rig up an emergency sail . The route Stig Lundvall took before being hit by a storm and getting lost off South Africa . The experienced sailor said he managed to stay alive only by rationing his food and by collecting rain water in buckets on deck. He added: 'I am skin and bone. Normally I am 85kg and I was 65kg when I got on to the ship. 'I am very weak still, I will need to build my strength again and my balance is not so good. I can look drunk when I walk.' The newspaper reported that Mr Lundvall had been on a solo voyage to Australia when his Marieholm yacht Sea Star was immobilised by the storm. One of the sailor's worried friends contacted South African marine rescuers in February after he failed to arrive in port on schedule. A spokesman for the Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centre in Cape Town today confirmed the organisation led a three-month search for the missing yacht. After six weeks they alerted their colleagues in Britain, Australia and New Zealand after failing to find Mr Lundvall. The spokesman confirmed he was eventually brought back to dry land on April 17, 78 days after his ordeal began. Mr Lundvall was today recovering at home in Sweden. Asked whether he would sail again, he replied: 'Oh yes. But not long distance. Never again across oceans.'","Stig Lundvall found 350 miles off South Africa's coast .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 08:44 EST, 22 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:44 EST, 22 May 2012 . Labour MP Tom Watson today stood by his claim that media mogul Rupert Murdoch tried to halt his anti-phone hacking campaign by asking Tony Blair to 'call him off'. Mr Watson told the ongoing Leveson Inquiry into press ethics that former prime minister Gordon Brown phoned him in late 2010 or early 2011 to inform him about Mr Murdoch's request to Mr Blair. He said he distinctly remembered the call, which he took on his mobile phone while stood on a hill on the edge of the Peak District. Campaigner: Labour MP Tom Watson at today's Leveson Inquiry hearing . He said: 'It's not the sort of thing a backbench MP would forget too easily'. 'It was within a wider conversation, but I noted it.' Claim: Mr Watson repeated his claim that Tony Blair (pictured earlier this week) was behind attempts to stop him pursuing his anti-hacking agenda . The idea that News Corporation boss Mr Murdoch was intervening 'seemed implausible back then, but certainly seem more plausible day by day'. Mr Watson spearheaded the campaign to investigate allegations of phone hacking, which provoked widespread public disgust when it emerged the now defunct News of the World hacked the phone of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler. As well as more than 40 arrests, the scandal has led to the departure of News International CEO Rebekah Brooks and James Murdoch's resignation as chairman from BSkyB. The claim of the phone call, which Mr Watson has previously made in his book Dial M For Murdoch, has been denied by Mr Murdoch and Mr Blair, while Mr Brown says he cannot remember the conversation. Mr Watson, a member of the House of Commons' influential culture, media and sport select committee, claimed there had been a feeling News International had 'unique access to Downing Street'. The former junior minister at the Ministry of Defence said the News International newspapers were 'the ones that had the connections and everyone was aware of it'. 'As a minister when I discussed issues and policy there was always a conversation about how this would play out in The Sun,' he said. 'There was a sense that there was a mystique about the News International stable, that they had unique access to Downing Street, and as a minister that was important, and the way you were portrayed in News International papers was important and they factored that into their thinking.' 'Call him off': Tom Watson, pictured arriving at today's Leveson Inquiry hearing with a friend, claims News Corporation boss Rupert Murdoch personally intervened to try and stop the MP's anti-hacking campaign . Mr Watson claimed he was put under surveillance by News of the World journalists following a false tip that he had been having an affair with a female politician. He said he had seen an email trail showing Mazher Mahmood, the paper's 'Fake Sheikh', and other executives put together a 'team to conduct convert surveillance' in 2009. They wrongly believed Mr Watson was having an affair with a woman and 'creeping into her hotel' while the Labour Party conference in Brighton was held. News International said the surveillance was ordered purely to establish whether the tip was genuine and nothing to do with Mr Watson's membership of the culture, media and sport select committee. The media firm's management and standards committee turned over the emails to the parliamentary committee.","MP claims former prime minister Gordon Brown called him to tell him of attempted intervention .

A mall's marketing firm has been forced to take down a lewd sign outside of a New Jersey shopping centre after a public outcry. The sign, which was at MarketFair mall in Princeton, read: ‘We apologise for the whistling construction workers, but man you look good! So will we soon, please pardon our dust, dirt and other assorted inconveniences.’ It was accompanied by a hand-drawn leggy brunette in a figure-conscious orange shirt, curve-hugging skirt, and heeled black boots. Outrage: More than 2,000 people signed a petition demanding this sign outside of a Princeton, New Jersey mall be removed . Pardon our dust: The sign was outside MarketFair mall covering a construction site . The sign caused considerable outrage among shoppers, who said it was demeaning and sexist. One person said she signed the petition on Change.org because it painted men and women both in a singularly stereotypical light. ‘Thanks for assuming that all women are sex objects and all men (particularly blue-collar and/or minority men) are uncontrollable sex maniacs. This is your America,’ she wrote. Another wrote: ‘Not a joke, not a compliment. Women do not exist as eye candy.’ StopStreetHarassment.org wrote the petition demanding the sign be removed from the mall’s exterior. Within 24 hours after the petition was posted, the mall’s VP of Marketing, Robyn Marano, agreed to have the sign removed. She did not immediately respond to MailOnline's request for comment. The petition garnered more than 2,000 signatures, with many writing in their disgust at the sign's tactlessness. According to Jezebel, the sign covered a construction site run by E. Allen Reeves Construction Company. While ‘pardon our dust’ signs during construction and renovation are commonplace, this tongue-in-cheek sign clearly did not go over well with shoppers at the New Jersey mall. But this isn’t the first case of advertisements going too far with jokes about women. Under fire: Belvedere Vodka tweeted the controversial ad which appeared to make a joke about a woman being raped . In March, Belvedere Vodka briefly posted an advert implying date rape, with a smiling young man pulling a terrified woman in close. The caption read: 'Unlike some people, Belvedere always goes down smoothly.' The advertisement, which was posted on the company’s Twitter and Facebook accounts, was pulled an hour later. Belvedere later tweeted an apology, which read: ‘We apologise to any of our fans who were offended by our recent tweet. We continue to be an advocate of safe and responsible drinking.’ An additional apology was sent to Forbes writer Kashmir Hill, which read in part: ‘ . ‘The post is absolutely inconsistent with our values and beliefs and in addition to removing the offensive post we are committed to making sure that something like this doesn’t happen again. ‘As an expression of our deep disappointment and regret, we are making a charitable donation to a women’s support cause.

Terror etched on her face, a woman clings desperately to the sheer rockface as waves crash around her feet. Cut off by the incoming tide and left with no option but to try to scramble up the cliff, she screams for help to other holidaymakers on the beach. Luckily her cries were heard by the  coastguard, who raised the alarm as the rising water threatened to engulf her. Scroll down for video . Trapped: Frightened holidaymaker Stacey Hayes (circled) was caught out by the high Spring tide on Good Friday, and had to be winched to safety by a rescue helicopter . In danger: Miss Hayes could have died if she had fallen into the water, but was rescued after local Coastguard station manager Dave Jackson heard her cries and raised the alarm . The woman, Stacey Hayes, was winched . to safety by a Royal Navy helicopter moments after three other tourists – . including her boyfriend Adam Neal – were rescued from the bay by a . lifeboat. The group, from Leyland, Lancashire, . had been cut off by the tide between Green Bay and Porthcurno Beach in . Cornwall on Good Friday. Coastguard Dave Jackson said of the dramatic rescue:  'I could hear her screams so I called . Falmouth Coastguard and asked for a launch of [rescue helicopter] 193 . Culdrose immediately. 'She was screaming for help and was only about a foot off the water with waves breaking above her. 'From the minute Culdrose were called to when they got there, if she had fallen into the water it could have been very serious.' The rescue involved Land's End Coastguard, Sennen Cove RNLI and a Sea King helicopter from RNAS Culdrose. But the rescue was almost replicated the next day when four more holidaymakers were again caught out on the cliffs, just before 3pm. Terror: Miss Hayes's hysterical screams could be heard hundreds of metres away as she clung to the cliff by her fingernails, with waves crashing over her head . Edward and Sally Hater, from Brighton and Oxford respectively, and Zoe Vince, from London, were all winched to safety by the Culdrose helicopter after becoming trapped by the incoming tide. Mr and Mrs Hater had become stuck on the same section of cliff as Stacey Hayes the day before and were joined by coastguard station manager Mr Jackson as they waited for help. The fourth holidaymaker, Londoner Rosie Parsons, had slipped and fallen into the sea but scrambled to Green Bay for safety. She was rescued by the RNLI and taken to Porthcurno Beach where the other three were recovering. Rosie Parsons and Zoe Vince were later taken to Royal Cornwall Hospital as both were suffering symptoms of hypothermia. The incidents came as the coast was battered by Spring tides, which are some of the strongest of the year. Not technically linked to the season, Spring tides occur when the Earth, Sun and Moon are all in a line. Mr Jackson added: 'People were not aware of the state of the tides and clearly did not realise how quickly it comes in and cuts off exits. 'These incidents could have had a fatal outcome if it was not for the rapid response of the emergency services. 'People need to be aware of the state of the tides at all times, especially if there are no lifeguards on duty.' These were just some of a number of incidents across Cornwall attended by emergency services over the weekend. In the most serious, 60-year-old Peter Sleeman lost his life while attempting to rescue his 27-year-old son, Paul, who was later saved by Port Isaac RNLI, after he was swept off rocks at Tregardock, near Delabole, on Sunday.

A Libyan headmaster yesterday told how he was the real target of the assassin who gunned down WPc Yvonne Fletcher. Dr Adel Almansouri was shot in the leg in the hail of bullets that felled WPc Fletcher, standing near him outside the Libyan embassy in London in 1984. He said: 'The bullet that killed her was meant for me. Yvonne Fletcher saved my life.' Dr Almansouri was an 18-year-old student on a scholarship from Libya, and had decided to take part in the London protest against Colonel Gaddafi. Killed: WPC Yvonne Fletcher was only 25 when she was shot outside the Libyan Embassy in London . Speaking for the first time about the . fateful morning, Dr Almansouri, now 46, said: 'That shooter hit eleven . of us, ten Libyans and WPc Fletcher. 'She . was the one who died. But I do not believe the killer was aiming for . her. He was shooting at the Libyan protesters, not the British police.' Dr . Almansouri is now the headmaster of the International School of . Benghazi, the eastern city that rose up against Gaddafi last year and . sparked the revolution. He established the private college in October, the same month the tyrant was finally captured and executed. Twenty-eight years after the shooting, Dr Almansouri still bears a scar on his upper right thigh from the bullet wound. Recalling . the final moments of WPc Fletcher's life, he said: 'She can't have been . more than six feet away, standing directly between me and the embassy. 'And . she had a big smile on her face. I remember that smile very well.' He . told The Times newspaper: 'Moments after seeing that smile, I heard the . sound - an automatic machinegun firing. Everyone was panicking, jumping . on top of one another. 'I felt something warm in my leg. The police were yelling at us: ""Run, ******* run!"" I tried to move but instead I fell. That's when I realised they'd hit me too.' Dr Almansouri attended the protest, in St James's Square, Central London, after hearing about it and deciding it was important to be there. Shock: A colleague of the young police officer pays tribute to her after the siege in 1984 . He said: 'We were all very . frightened. We knew that if anyone from the embassy recognised us, then . not only our own lives, but those of our families back in Libya could be . in danger. 'But we felt . even more strongly about what Gaddafi was doing, about the persecution . and murder of political prisoners, and the total absence of democracy, . so we decided to go.' After recovering from his injuries, Dr Almansouri went on to gain his PhD from Loughborough University in 1997. Now living in Benghazi, he stood . unsuccessfully in local council elections this month, though does not . mind that he failed to win. He said: 'I am just grateful to have had . the opportunity to have exercised my democratic rights at all, which I . wouldn't have done had it not been for Yvonne Fletcher.' In memory: Queenie Fletcher at the memorial for her daughter, in the spot where she was gunned down . WPc Fletcher, 25, was shot dead while policing the protest. The gunman, shooting from a window in the embassy, was never identified. Scotland Yard has reopened the murder inquiry with the help of Libya's National Transitional Council, after years of being rebuffed by the Gaddafi regime. Earlier this month, two detectives from the Met's Counter Terrorism Command flew to Tripoli to hold talks with the country's chief law officer. The trip was the first in recent years and raises new hope of solving the killing of the officer. Scotland Yard said it hoped its 'preliminary discussions' would pave the way for the Met and Libyan authorities to work together to identify the assassin.","Dr Adel Almansouri was shot in the leg in the hail of bullets that felled her .

With the amount of mud slinging which has already taken place between the former couple, there was no doubt Christie Brinkley's ex-husband was going to retaliate after she broke down in tears on TV and called him a narcissist. Peter Cook hit back at his wife of 12 years, branding her emotional interview yesterday as a 'cunning and shameless display in what I can only imagine was an attempt to garner public sympathy by dishonest means'. During the former supermodel's interview with Matt Lauer yesterday on the Today Show, she broke down in tears as she poured her heart out about the misery she has been through, telling Lauer that she just wanted peace for her family. Scroll down for video . Accusations: Peter Cook, left, said his ex-wife's tears were a 'cunning and shameless display in what I can only imagine was an attempt to garner public sympathy by dishonest means' She also claimed that every time she achieves any kind of success or joy, Cook does his best to destroy it. Shortly after her appearance, the . Hampton's architect released an accusatory statement saying: 'Christie . was entirely dishonest about the circumstances surrounding the current . court action which was precipitated by her and . . . is doing further . damage to our children. 'I am also shocked by the blatant . lies she told regarding our divorce proceedings of four years ago, . including denying the indisputable fact that she fought for an open . courtroom despite the warnings it would harm our children. 'She will stop at nothing to continue the drama in our lives in order to harass me and keep herself relevant in the media. 'She does not want peace, she wants attention.' He added his ex-wife still wants . revenge on him for cheating with neighbour's daughter Diana Bianchi, saying: 'Clearly, . Christie does not believe I was punished enough four years ago for my . indiscretions in our marriage, but for the sake of our children I wish . she would find a way to move on.' Emotional: Brinkley struggled to contain her tears as she explained to Matt Lauer that she just wanted peace for her family away from Peter Cook . Happier times: Christie Brinkley and Peter Cook, pictured together in 2006, reached a divorce settlement in 2008 after months of very public court disputes . In the last month, there has . been a consistent media storm surrounding the estranged couple - who . were married for 12 years - which started when Christie told a judge . that Peter Cook was sending her rude emails and had not been keeping up . with child maintenance payments. The architect then went on damage control, appearing on a number of talk shows to slam his ex-wife, branding her a liar and a 'narcissistic egomaniac'. He recently accused her of 'throwing her family under a bus' and 'running a media circus' to promote her Broadway show. When asked by Matt Lauer . yesterday why she has now decided to speak publicly about the ongoing . battle, she said: 'Since the day he realized I wasn't coming back there . has been a character assassination. 'I . asked for a confidentiality agreement and got it. I alone have . maintained that. I had a lot of offers to come on TV and talk about it . and I didn't want to do it. 'I . have turned the other cheek. There is not one quote from me anywhere. This is the first time I've been on a show and I'm really here to talk . about Chicago. Former family: Christie Brinkley is joined by Peter Cook and children Sailor and Jack in New York in 2004 . 'But . I have endured weeks of lies and character assassination and a media . storm. I have never taken part in name calling. The only thing I ever . said at the end of the second trial was 'Google ""divorcing a . narcissist"". 'I'm not alone. I've gotten hundreds of letters from women who are going through this. It's not easy.' Cook denied claims he owes the 58-year-old child maintenance and said he pays double what is required by courts. But . she revealed on the Today show that he pays $600 a month for each of . their children which she calls 'a very minimal amount of money'. She added: 'It wasn't about the money. I have hesitated to do anything with the court because he actually likes the publicity and he likes going to court.' Lauer . then asked the former Sports Illustrated model - who has been married . four times - what all of this is doing to her children and why they . cannot be civil to each other for their sakes. Highly charged: Christie Brinkley sat down with Matt Lauer to talk about Chicago but instead broke down when describing the torment at the hands of her ex-husband . The . mother-of-three said: 'Peter has went on several shows, this is my . first. So maybe ask him why he is doing this to the kids.' She . also said there should be some type of legislation that protects . families from spouses who have been diagnosed by the court-appointed . forensic psychiatrist as a bona fide malignant or extreme narcissist. When . the interview came to a close, and it was pointed out that little . mention was made of Chicago, Christie struggled to talk as she . desperately asked for peace.

'Every time I have any joy or any . kind of success in anything, he has to try to destroy it.' Last week her lawyers responded to the Cook's claims his ex wife was using her family and their divorce to promote her show. Brinkley's attorney, Tom Campagna, released the . following statement: 'Peter Cook has repeatedly broken the . confidentiality agreement that Christie has continued to uphold. 'Peter . is the only one to go on national television spewing sexist, . disgraceful, demonstrably false lies, which gives a taste of what . Christie has had to endure since Peter betrayed his marriage vows. 'Peter . embarrassed himself and hurt his family by having an affair with a . teenage girl and admitting to an extensive pornography habit.' This came after Cook told ABC News he . believed she was throwing her family 'under the bus' to drum up . publicity for her return to Broadway. 'She can use her celebrity to get the . media to say ""He's a bad guy"". You know … I'm not trying to sell tickets . to anything. I don't want this press. I'm not interested in it. 'And . there's got to be a better way for her to do it. Go do a charitable act . or something, get your name in the paper. But stop throwing your family . under the bus.' Christie Brinkley, right, has a daughter with first husband, Billy Joel, left, seen together in 1994 . Christie met Cook in 1998 and had her third child, Sailor, with him. He legally adopted her son with ex-husband Richard Taubman, Jack. She also has a daughter, Alexa Ray, with second husband, musician Billy Joel. Christie appeared in several of his music videos, including the 1983 hit Uptown Girl. They were married for nine years. But Ms Brinkley, who has been married four times, has been trading jabs with Mr Cook since their acrimonious split in 2008. Bitter divorce proceedings revealed Mr Cook spent thousands of dollars a month accessing internet porn. He was also romantically involved with a neighbour’s daughter, Diana Bianchi, who was 18 at the time. During their 2008 divorce, the court was told that he had paid Ms Bianchi $300,000 in the hope of her keeping the liaison quiet. Ms Brinkley meanwhile charged that Mr .

A British schoolboy plunged more than 100ft to his death in Dubai after an alcohol-fuelled row. Harry Harling, 15, wrote online that he was enjoying ‘beers and tanning’ with friends in the United Arab Emirates last Friday. Hours later, an ‘angry’ Harry was seen leaving a house party alone after an argument. Tragic: Harry Harling, 15, plunged more than 100ft to his death in Dubai after an alcohol-fuelled row . Happy: Harry Harling, 15, had been drinking at a party into the early hours of Saturday morning before becoming separated from his friends . He left a cryptic message on Twitter – ‘**** the system’ – before apparently jumping to his death from the 11th floor of a nearby building site. Harry’s father Nicolus, 49, and mother Beverley, 46, were last night being comforted by friends from Dubai’s close-knit expat community. They settled in the region after leaving their £740,000 home on a private estate in Woking, Surrey, nine years ago. Both Harry and his sister Rebecca, 19, were enrolled at £9,500-a-year Jumeirah College, which is popular with wealthy British expatriates. Grieving: Nicolus and Beverley Harling, pictured, are being comforted by fellow expats following the death of their son . Local police are investigating how Harry gained access to the building site, as well as how he and his friends got hold of alcohol in a country where its sale is severely restricted due to Muslim laws. One theory is that the boys were given the drinks by an adult at the party. Harry, who had been due to play in the final round of a rugby tournament on Saturday, is believed to have rowed with a friend on Friday night. The pair were pulled apart, and Harry then stormed out. His friends are thought to have stayed at the party for about an hour longer. Some wrote of their regrets on Facebook. Harry Francis said: ‘Mate I’m so sorry, I should never have left you alone on Friday. ‘I should have stayed with you till you got a taxi. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me.’ James Ozden replied: ‘Everyone is thinking of ways they could have changed  the outcome, but it’s not fair for you to blame yourself!’ Dubai police chief Brigadier Khaleel Ibraheem Al Mansouri confirmed that Harry  had fallen from a building in the Motor  City district – an area that is still largely under construction. ‘Our investigation shows that he was attending a party with his friends in a flat in the same area and was consuming alcohol when a big dispute took place between them,’ he said. ‘He left the party angry and went to an empty building nearby, and jumped from a window on the 11th floor and died instantly. Distraught: Harry was in Year 11 at Jumeirah College in the UAE. Head teacher Fiona Cottam said counselling was available to distraught staff and pupils . ‘His friends said that they didn’t know what he was going to do. ‘Investigations are on-going to ascertain the reason behind the dispute which made the teenager end his life.’ He called for parents in the expat community to ‘watch their children to make sure they don’t get into problems with drugs or alcohol’. Former neighbours of the Harlings, who once lived in a substantial double-fronted detached property on a private road in Woking, described them as ‘lovely’. Barney Powell, 49, lives in the close, where houses now sell for about £1.2million. He said Harry’s father had worked as a trader in the City. Popular: Friends left tributes on facebook . Tragic: Harry had been had been at a party with friends in Dubai where he lived with his ex-pat family . ‘They were a lovely family,’ he added. ‘When Harry was here  he was only around five, but you used to see him playing with his sister Rebecca, who was a few years older.’ Harry’s paternal grandmother Cecilia Poupart, 71, who lives close to the former family home, was too upset to speak yesterday. In England, Harry attended Hoe Bridge School, a private prep school which charges up to £13,000 a year. Rebecca went to Halstead Preparatory School for Girls, which charges £11,000 a year. Dubai’s English-language Jumeirah College was set up in 1999 to meet the growing demand of the expat population. British students are in the majority at the school, where classes are based on the English national  curriculum and pupils sit GCSEs  and A-levels. Students play cricket, football and rugby, and the school even takes part in the Duke of Edinburgh’s Award scheme.","Harry Harling had been drinking at a party with friends .

He was put on life support for 24 hours . before the family decided to let him go on March 24. 'We just held him, cuddling him for his last moments of life,' Hebb told . the paper. 'Six hours later, he took his last breath and passed away'. His mother, recently moved to Oregon from Utah, says she never thought the washing machine would be a danger to her child and is telling her story to make parents aware of the danger. The Consumer Products Safety Commission, a federal agency, says such deaths are rare — two children under the age of five died in washing machines between 2005 and 2009, according to a recent report. Tiffany and Chris Hebb will probably not face charges, according Michael Rouches, spokesman for police in Hillsboro, Oregon. 'Detectives don't believe that this was an intentional crime or that anyone stuck the baby in the washer,' Mr Roushes said on Monday. 'We have the DA's office look into it, just to make sure there wasn't a degree of negligence.' Memorial: Ollie's father Chris described the agony of waking up and remembering his son is gone . Mr Rouches said detectives couldn't find other cases when toddlers drowned under similar circumstances. 'She was 30 feet away in the living room, reading a magazine,' he said. 'It wasn't like the mother had this kid unattended at the time.' The 2011 report says two children under the age of 5 died in washing machines between 2005 and 2009. During that time, 350 children died in bathtubs, and 77 drowned in something else, such as a decorative water feature, a cooler or a septic tank. Danger: Ollie's parents are using his death as a chance to remind others of the perils of household appliances . Ollie when his parents decided to take him off life support after 24 hours. His organs were donated, to give other children a chance of life. The couple had recently moved from Orem, Utah to the Portland suburb where Mr Hebb had found a job. The boy was buried over the weekend in Utah. 'Every night when I go to sleep, I start feeling sick,' Mr Hebb told the Deseret News. 'Every time I wake up, I think this is a nightmare and then realise it's real. You hear a baby crying in the night from a neighbour's house. You wake up, hoping it's your little boy, and then realise he's not there.'","21-month-old Ollie Hebb drowned at family home after accident with washer .

Fabrice Muamba sits up his hospital bed wearing a wide smile almost two weeks after collapsing mid-way through a match. The footballer's fiance Shauna Magunda posted the heart-warming image earlier today to say thank you to the millions of fans who have supported her partner after he suffered a near fatal heart attack. It shows the Bolton FC star wearing a blue hooded sports top and lying back in his hospital bed. His smile shows the miraculous recovery he has made since the game on March 17. Heart-warming: Fabrice Muamba sits up smiling in his hospital bed today almost two weeks after collapsing midway through a football match . Ms Magunda wrote alongside the image: 'Fab wanted me to post this pic for you all and to also say thank you for such overwhelming support.' The picture attracted a string of emotional responses from fans on the social networking site. One wrote: 'God bless you Fabrice. You keep on fighting, son. Get well soon.' Muamba's heart stopped for 78 minutes as paramedics - including a cardiologist who leapt onto the pitch from the stands - battled to keep the player alive. He was rushed to the London Chest Hospital, where he . was visited by his Bolton team-mates and a string of football friends. It was later revealed that 15 defibrillator shocks were administered before the sportsman began to show signs of life. The incident stunned the football community and heralded a worldwide outpouring of sympathy for the 23-year-old player as his family urged fans to prey for him. The picture will delight the legions of football supporters who have followed the plight of the youngster. He is likely to undergo a long rehabilitation before he can come close to playing again. Meanwhile, a student who mocked the footballer on Twitter after he collapsed today lost his appeal against a 56-day jail term. Liam Stacey, 21, of Pontypridd, south Wales, sobbed as he was taken away following the failed sentence appeal hearing at Swansea Crown Court. 'God is in control': Shauna Magunda, right, Fabrice Muamba's fiancee urged her Twitter followers to keep the Bolton player in their prayers as he fights for life . Stacey now faces being thrown off his University course. He had been in the the final semester of his three-year biology degree but with the case gaining widespread publicity, his barrister Paul Hobson said Stacey's future was now in tatters. Mr Justice Wyn Williams told him he rejected an argument that Stacey had already been punished enough. He said the Swansea University biology student had admitted an offence, racially aggravated public disorder, of intent. 'He was intending to say what he said and was intending to produce the effect that he did.' The court heard Stacey has been treated as a 'pariah' by other prisoners since he was locked up. High Court Judge Mr Justice Wyn Williams told him: 'There can be no avoiding the conclusion that your offence was committed in the context of a grave illness that had afflicted Fabrice Muamba. 'It was immediately apparent that he was gravely ill and while he was lying prostrate on the pitch you posted comments that were extremely racist couched in terms that can only be described as extremely offensive. 'What was written was capable of being read by any user of Twitter and these messages provoked a very strong response. 'You received responses which were extremely critical but you did not desist - instead you posted eight messages which were extremely abusive and insulting. 'You later realised the enormity of your behaviour and tried to apologise. But you deserve to be punished for your actions. It can’t be argued that a term of 56 days is too long for this offence. 'By pleading guilty you admitted a racist intent to your comments.' Shame: Liam Stacey is led away in handcuffs outside Swansea Magistrates Court . Stacey was watching the FA cup match between Spurs and Bolton Wanderers on TV when Muamba fell to the ground. Earlier he had been drinking while watching Wales win the rugby Grand Slam match against France. Stacey Tweeted: “LOL, F*** Muamba. He’s dead!!! £haha,” - then posted eight further offensive racist messages. Stacey was jailed for 56 days on Tuesday after admitting racially aggravated harassment and disorder. The reviled tweet came at a time when the Bolton midfielder's plight was attracting a . wave of sympathy around the world. Football fans watched in horror as Muamba collapsed after suffering a heart attack during the FA Cup clash. Millions witnessed the incident at White Hart Lane as Bolton's clash with home team Tottenham Hotspur was screened live on television. Stacey, seen arriving at the court earlier in the morning, posted a series of vile tweets about footballer Fabrice Muamba . But after a drunken Stacey received a deluge critical replies to his distasteful tweet, he responded with a torrent of racist abuse on the website. A criminal conviction for a racially . aggravated public order offence has all but killed the undergraduate's . dream of becoming a forensic scientist. His incarceration means he will not be able to sit some upcoming exams - and as a result will fail his third year. But more importantly, next month . university officials will hold a disciplinary hearing to decide whether . to kick out the suspended Stacey for good. Swansea University student Jon May, who is the features editor for . student newspaper The Waterfront, said there was not a great deal of . sympathy for Stacey - despite him once being a popular figure. 'A lot of people have been calling for him to be expelled,' added the 22-year-old business management undergraduate. 'What he said has shocked a lot of people on campus. He's currently suspended at the moment, and a disciplinary hearing is going to take place in April. 'Given what has happened, the whole affair is hardly a good news story for the university.' Support for Stacey’s jail sentence was widespread on the day it was handed down, and widely debated on Twitter. But a significant minority criticised his punishment and claimed it was politically motivated to make an example of him. His legal team will tomorrow launch an appeal against his sentence at Swansea Crown Court. The hearing, which is expected to last at least one hour, will go before High Court judge Mr Justice Wyn Williams. The messages were forwarded to the police by several members of the social network, including former England striker Stan Collymore, himself a victim of abuse on Twitter. Stacey initially claimed his account . had been accessed by somebody else, but later pleaded guilty to racially . aggravated harassment, and was sent to prison to ‘reflect the public . outrage’ at his comments. As he spent his first night . behind bars, the two teams replayed the . fixture that was called off when the midfielder came close to . death. Tottenham and Bolton met again at White Hart Lane, with the home team cruising to a 3-1 victory. It means Muamba's club are now out of the FA Cup, but this hardly seemed to matter to the fans and players treating the match as a chance to pay tribute to him. Team-mate Sam Ricketts was seen to wipe a tear from . his eye before kick-off. It was a difficult return for the entire Bolton . squad, and manager Owen Coyle commended them for their bravery. Players from both sides wore T-shirts . bearing messages of thanks to those who supported Muamba, while the . whole of the Tottenham stadium erupted in applause for him. Stacey, meanwhile, faces expulsion from . Swansea University. The third-year biology student had hoped to become a . forensic scientist. Describing his tweets, prosecutor Louise Barron . told the court: ‘The offence is clearly racially aggravated. ‘There was sustained and gratuitous . racism. These were unprovoked comments and persistent abuse. The . recipients were disgusted.’ Jailing the student at Swansea . Magistrates’ Court, District Judge John Charles said: ‘Not just the . footballer’s family, not just the footballing world, but the whole world . were literally praying for Muamba’s life. Your comments aggravated this . situation. ‘I have no choice but to impose an immediate custodial sentence to reflect the public outrage at what you have done.’ Applause: Rival players join in the applause for Muamba after seeing him collapse on the pitch almost two weeks ago . Bolton teammates applaud Muamba during a tribute at the start of their replay against Tottenham last week . Stacey made his comments about the . Bolton midfielder while celebrating the Welsh . rugby team’s Six Nations grand slam victory earlier this month. The judge added: ‘You committed this . offence while you were drunk and it is clear you immediately regretted . it. 'But you must learn how to handle your alcohol better.’ Stacey, from Pontypridd, South Wales, . told police following his arrest at his student home in Swansea: ‘I was . at the bar when I heard what had happened to Muamba. 'I don’t know why I . posted [the comments]. I’m not racist and some of my friends are from . different cultural backgrounds.’ He later sent a text message to a . friend saying: ‘I said something about Muamba that I shouldn’t have and . tweeted back to some people who abused me. 'Getting police on me now . which isn’t good at all.’ Solidarity: Bolton's Nigel Reo-Coker (left) and Tottenham's Jermain Defoe shake hands .

Another read: ‘Been bawling my eyes out on the phone to my mother for the last hour, really can’t be dealing with this.’ Gareth Jones, defending, said Stacey . ‘does not bear [Muamba] any grudge and is glad he is making a good . recovery’. He continued: ‘My client simply lost his head and posted . these disgusting comments to the bitter shame of himself and his . parents. 'For a moment of madness, his career has now gone.’ Stacey’s . father Neale, 49, and mother Hayley, 46, were visibly shocked when the . details of his comments were read aloud yesterday. Jim .

"By . Lee Moran . UPDATED: . 18:56 EST, 7 February 2012 . Silence broken: Asma Assad, the British-born wife of Syria's president, has spoken for the first time since the country's uprising began last March . The British-born wife of Syria's president has spoken for the first time since the country’s uprising began last March. In a carefully worded email, Asma Assad appears to offer full support to her husband Bashar as his security forces try to crush the opposition. 'The President is the President of Syria, not a faction of Syrians, and the First Lady supports him in that role,' she told The Times. 'These days she is equally involved in bridging gaps and encouraging dialogue. She listens to and comforts the families of the victims of the violence.' Mrs Assad, 36, approved the text following a critical article in the newspaper last week. It had asked what an educated woman, raised in liberal Britain and with a long record of good works, must think of the slaughter, torture and imprisonment of thousands. But her statement that she was comforting the bereaved was greeted with anger by Syrian experts and opposition activists. They said she had an 'ostrich attitude' and was delusional. The email followed claims last month that Syrian security forces tried to smuggle her, and her children, out of the country. They were reportedly in a convoy, also carrying the president's mother and cousin, intercepted by brigades of army defectors, that came under heavy fire as they made their way to Damascus airport. They were forced to turn back to the city's presidential palace. Fleeing: Asma (right), the wife of Syrian President Bashar Assad, and their two children, seven-year-old Karim (right) and nine-year-old Zein (left) are believed to have been caught trying to flee, it has been claimed . Cold comfort: The email said Asma Assad was helping the bereaved to cope. Pictured here are the victims of shelling by the Syrian army in the Khalidiya neighbourhood in Homs . And it comes as her husband ordered . an intensification of a crackdown on protesters, which has so far killed . more than 5,400 rebels, and was visited by Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss ways to try to end the uprising. The email is the first communication . Asma Assad, who grew up in Acton, West London, has had with . international media in 11 months. Assad, who was known as Emma during her childhood, is the daughter of consultant cardiologist Fawaz Akhras and retired diplomat Sahar Otri, both Sunni Muslims. They moved from Syria to London in the Fifties so that her father, who is now based at the Cromwell Hospital and in Harley Street, could get the best possible education and medical training. Asma, who holds dual citizenship, British and Syrian, was educated at a Church of England school in Ealing before attending a private girls’ day school - Queen’s College, Harley Street. From Queen’s, where she achieved four A-levels, Asma went to King’s College London to read Computer Science and take a diploma in French Literature. She graduated with a First and, after six months of travelling, joined Deutsche Bank as an analyst in hedge-fund management. Royal connections: The Queen (right) met Syrian President Bashar Assad (centre) and his wife Asma (left) at Buckingham Palace in 2002 . Bombed out: Asma Assad said she still supported her husband, who has launched a crackdown on opposition groups in recent months . She then moved to the investment bank JP Morgan and worked in Paris and New York, as well as London. It was on family holidays back in Syria that she met Bashar. Then he, too, came to London to study ophthalmology, though he had to leave early to return to Syria after his elder brother Basil, who had been the heir, died in a car crash. Asma started seeing him in secret, resigning from JP Morgan just a month before the wedding without being able to explain the real reason. With her father, she has set up several London-based charities such as the Syria Heritage. Vogue has described her as ‘the freshest and most magnetic of first ladies’ and she has topped French Elle’s ‘most stylish woman in politics’ list. In Damascus, Bashar and Asma now live in a flat with plate-glass windows and their three boys go to a Montessori school. She speaks four languages and her connections with France have led her to persuade the Louvre to help her open Syrian cultural attractions. Greeting: Syrian President Bashar Assad (left) held talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov (right) in a bid to try and diffuse the escalating violence .

Alarm: The SUV starts to rise in the air as the manhole shoots explodes out of the ground . The metal cover then shoots up, causing The Freelander 2 to suddenly flip up and almost totally leave the ground totally as its boot shoots into the air.

Unexpected: Three of the cars four wheels are off the ground as the vehicle goes into a barrel roll . Side: The vehicle comes to a rest close to the now exposed manhole which seems to have exploded . After a moment alarmed passers-by approach the Land Rover, as does the driver of the vehicle behind who captured the incident on camera. One man quickly scans the roof of the upturned car before reaching in through where its windscreen used to be. Concern: A passer-by helps the driver from the vehicle, through its smashed windscreen . Uninjured: The shocked Land Rover driver (in cream jacket) is left scratching his head after the bizarre incident . The dazed driver then emerges, almost unaided and after a quick stumble the man in a cream jacket stands up straight and has quick look around. He then steps back from the Land Rover, seemingly unharmed, and can be seen scratching his head trying to work out what had happened. Unexplained: The manhole seems to explode sending the car in front into a barrel roll . What caused the cover to blow is not clear, but afterwards it can be seen on the ground near the car. The fact that a fixed street camera caught the incident, as well as a second driver, suggests the incident was not a set-up.","The Land Rover suddenly shoots into the air while driving down a Russian street .

A teenage girl pimp who used intimidation and bullying to get vulnerable young women to partake in sex with older men avoided prosecution because authorities felt it was not in the public interest. The teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was dubbed ‘The Honey Monster’ because of  the sick role she played in procuring girls for a gang of men in Rochdale between 2008 and 2009. Young victims from ‘chaotic’ ‘council estate’ backgrounds were coerced by the teenager, who was 15 at the time, from popular ‘honeypot’ locations such as outside takeaway restaurants, Liverpool Crown Court heard. Guilty: Kabeer Hassan 25 (left) who has been found guilty of conspiracy and rape and Mohammed Amin, 45, (right) who has been found guilty of conspiracy and sexual assault . Prosecuted: Hamid Safi, 22, left, who has been found guilty of conspiracy and trafficking but not guilty of two counts of rape and Adil Khan, 42, who has been found guilty of conspiracy and trafficking for sexual exploitation . Nine men were today found guilty of grooming and passing round vulnerable schoolgirls aged between the ages of 13 and 15 for sex after plying them with alcohol and drugs. The jury was told the teenager used intimidation and bullying to coerce other teenagers to have sex with the men at ‘chill houses’ while she collected payment. One victim told jurers that 'The Honey Monster' was the key player in the sex abuse. She said: 'She was intimidating, she was nasty, she was scary. 'If it was up to me she would be on trial getting worse than they are because she is the main one in this. 'I believe if it was not for her I would not have got into what was going on.' However, despite victims blaming the teenager’s intimidating tactics for forcing them to have sex with the men the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to prosecute. Nazir Afzal, chief crown prosecutor for the North West, said: 'A careful assessment of all the evidence demonstrated her involvement in the conspiracy with which the defendants were eventually charged.' But he added: 'In considering whether or not to prosecute her, the CPS applied the code for crown prosecutors and determined that it was not in the public interest to do so.’ He said factors taken into consideration when making the decision included her age at the time of the offences (15-16), her own background and the circumstances in which she became involved in these events. Offenders: Abdul Qayyum, 44, has been found guilty of conspiracy. Mohammed Sajid, 35, has been found guilty of conspiracy, trafficking, one count of rape and one count of sexual activity with a child . Facing jail: Taxi driver Abdul Aziz, 41 (left) has been found guilty of conspiracy and trafficking for sexual exploitation and Abdul Rauf, 43, of Rochdale, was found guilty of conspiracy and trafficking for sexual exploitation . The court heard how 'The Honey Monster' became the girlfriend of one of the gang and often plied the victims with alcohol, food and money. It was told she sometimes had sex with one man while another raped a girl in the same room. A witness who gave evidence at the trial about a conversation she had with 'The Honey Monster' said the teenager boasted about her role. She told the court: ‘The Honey Monster started going on about how they had sex with Asian guys for money. ‘The Honey Monster was saying it like it was some big achievement. The witness told the jury that the girl said she was 'not doing it herself. She was getting other people to do it for her'. One of the men was said to be taxi driver Mohammed Amin, who was convicted of sexual assault. He was known to the girls by the nickname 'Car Zero'. The witness said Car Zero was involved in the conversation. She added: 'He said she (The Honey Monster) is the hardest in Heywood. If you want to work for her you will be ok. She looks after us all. 'She was sat there, like, with this big smirk on her face like it was something to be proud of.' The witness then went on to describe how the coercive teenager told another girl, who was 15, to have sex with a 'skinny Pakistani man'. She said she 'could tell she didn't want to go'. She said 'the girl eventually went and the witness described how after about 15 minutes she heard crying in the bedroom. She said she went in and saw the girl sat on bed with no underwear on.She added: 'She was scared. She was crying quite a lot. He was walking out of the bedroom. 'I then remember the (Honeymonster) coming into the bedroom and she started laughing. And I said 'why are you laughing at that? That's disgusting.' Honeypot: The Tasty Bites takeaway in Market Street, Heywood, near Rochdale, is one of the places where the teenager dubbed 'The Honey Monster' is said to have coerced the victims .

The BBC has been accused of 'breathtaking arrogance' after it hired a manager who lives in the United States to oversee the movement of staff four miles across London. Guy Bradshaw, who lives more than 4,000 miles away in Kentucky, has been handed a key role in the relocation of BBC journalists and producers to the new Broadcasting House. He was hired despite the fact MPs savaged the BBC in an official report last year for giving him a senior role in the Corporation's controversial move to Salford. In a withering attack last May, the powerful Commons Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee said the BBC had opened itself to 'self-inflicted and predictable ridicule' by sanctioning the extraordinary arrangement. Such decisions cannot simply be dismissed as inconsequential gaffes. They lower the esteem of the BBC, its senior management and the BBC Trust in the eyes of the ­public and its own staff.' The committee called on Trust chairman Lord Patten 'to ensure the BBC is seen always to lead by example in the future'. MPs now plan to raise the matter with BBC director-general Mark Thompson. The Mail on Sunday can reveal Mr Bradshaw has been transferred to another senior role at the Corporation while still living in the United States. He is a project manager responsible for organising the relocation of more than 5,000 people, as well as technical and broadcasting equipment, from Television Centre at Shepherd's Bush, and from Bush House in The Aldwych, to the BBC's £1 billion new London headquarters in Portland Place. Last week, however, Mr Bradshaw was seen strolling in the sunshine through the Kentucky town of Midway, where he lives with his wife and daughter. Last night, Lib Dem MP Adrian Sanders, a member of the Culture Committee, said: 'This shows breathtaking arrogance by the BBC. We don't produce these reports for a laugh. They have a ­serious purpose. 'We have the best interest of the licence fee-payer at heart. If the BBC is not responding to our criticism, we may have to call them back and hold them to account.' The committee chairman, Conservative MP John Whittingdale, added: 'I am sure this is something we would want to talk to the director-general about. It does look contemptuous [of the committee], almost like a deliberate snub by the BBC by giving him a new appointment after the committee was so critical.' In his new role, Mr Bradshaw is attached to a division called BBC Workplace, which manages the Corporation's multi-million-pound property portfolio. Despite the seniority of his position, he is not a BBC staff member and is believed to be paid through his own company, Stone Ticket, which he set up last year. The big commute: Guy Bradshaw is overseeing the four-mile move of staff from BBC Television Centre in London's Shepherd's Bush to Broadcasting House in Portland Place, while living more than 4,000 miles away in Midway, Kentucky . The Government is clamping down on such arrangements, which allow individuals to avoid income tax and national insurance, instead paying  corporation tax at a lower rate. Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander said last week that he wanted to ban 'off-payroll engagement without sufficient transparency' throughout the public sector, including the BBC. According to Treasury sources, he is keen for the BBC to publish details of its payments to contract workers. BBC employees are furious about the special arrangements put in place for Mr Bradshaw but claim their protests have been ignored by senior managers. Workers sent a letter to The Mail on Sunday last week, describing themselves as 'a group of concerned and angry BBC staff'. They wrote: 'Contrary to indications given by management … the BBC has continued to employ Mr Bradshaw through his own personal (tax efficient) service company, engaging him as a freelancer so he pays no PAYE or National Insurance. 'He has been given the plum job of managing the move of staff to New Broadcasting House. As employees we have questioned this but received no response from management. It's a scandal and one that, for some ­reason, management won't tackle.' Mr Bradshaw, 45, and his wife ­Melanie, 51, own two properties in Midway, in the heart of Kentucky's racehorse breeding country. He was out shopping in the town on Friday but declined to speak to a Mail on Sunday reporter. Miles away: Guy Bradshaw's Kentucky home is 4,019 miles from the new Broadcasting House in London . He started working full-time on his new project on April 1 when he was still involved with the final stages of the Salford move. Earlier in his career, Mr Bradshaw  was on the BBC staff for nearly 20 years but was made redundant in 2006. However, he was soon working for the Corporation again despite his move to America. As the BBC's Migration Manager, he was employed through a company called Equals Consulting. In 2010, when he was still leading the Salford project, he worked 25 weeks in Britain, just under the threshold for paying UK income tax. Yesterday the BBC refused to discuss Mr Bradshaw's salary arrangements but said he covered all the costs of airline tickets and accommodation himself when working for the Corporation in the UK. A spokesman said: 'Guy Bradshaw's personal arrangements, such as where he lives, do not have any bearing on his ability to do the job and do not cost the BBC any extra money. Any suggestion the BBC is not complying with HMRC regulations is not true.' Lord Patten was unavailable for comment. A BBC Trust spokesman said: 'The employment of individuals is a matter for the executive, not the Trust.'","May 2011: Commons blast BBC after Mail on Sunday reveals bosses hired manager in Kentucky, USA, to help move London HQ to Salford .

District Court Judge Stephen Abany told the small but packed courtroom he wanted to send a message to all drivers with Deveau's sentence. The teenager had earlier said he wished he could 'take it all back'.

Police investigating the decapitation of a woman by a lorry have revealed CCTV images of the victim before she was hit and a what appears to be a man seen walking off with her shoes and handbag afterwards. Witnesses claim they saw an Asian man calmly bending down and picking up the possessions as pandemonium broke out in the aftermath of the tragedy near Manchester Royal Infirmary. Police are still battling to identify the victim, who was dressed in in traditional Muslim attire, after no one reported a missing woman who matches her description. Scroll down to see the CCTV . A man is seen carrying objects, including shoes, near where the woman was hit. A witness says a man calmly picked up her shoes and handbag - which where catapulted 100 yards from her body - afterwards . She died instantly when she stepped into the path of the articulated lorry as it was being driven through the rush hour. The ensuing impact  propelled her handbag and shoes up to 100 yards from the rest of her body. The grisly nature of the incident led to ghoulish onlookers taking sick pictures of the gruesome scene and posting them on Twitter. Police want to track down the man who was captured on CCTV carrying objects including shoes. Who is she? The victim, wearing traditional clothes, moments before she was hit by a hit-and-run driver . Supt Wasim Chaudhry said: ‘We are really looking to speak to this man who is seen to pick up the ladies shoes and also possibly the handbag, maybe in good faith. ‘That handbag is key to establishing the identity of the victim. We have also looked at missing reports and at the moment there are no matches, so we are reliant on people coming forward. ‘I know the community will be very distressed and I want to reassure them that we have a team of very experienced officers investigating the matter. ‘The gentleman has been seen on CCTV picking up the shoes and then walking away. ‘It may well be the person has put them to one side or taken them for handing them in. ‘They haven't come forward yet with those items. ‘Whilst the incident was on going those shoes have been collected. I can hope that this person has person has done so in good faith maybe thinking it was lost property, maybe handing them in to the police. ‘We haven't had it handed in yet. It's inevitable we will have family members and friends concerned that a loved one hasn't come home. I would urge anyone who is concerned to come forward. ‘At this stage we are still working to identify who this victim was in what is a really tragic case.’ Police were called to the scene at 10am on Thursday on Upper Brook Street in Longsight to find the woman's body parts strewn across the road. They also discovered the truck driver had driven on apparently oblivious that he had hit the woman. A 47-year old trucker was later arrested on suspicion of murder after his vehicle was pulled over by police at a side street near a council tip three miles from the death scene - but he was subsequently released without charge. Search: Forensic officers searching a logistics lorry on a industrial park in Newton Heath, Manchester . Scene: Police Officers at the scene where the remains of a woman's body were found in the middle of the road . Police then arrested another lorry driver, aged 40, on suspicion of causing death by careless driving. Officers believe the dead woman was local to the area and had black hair. She was wearing gold bangles on each wrist, had a pierced nose, a toe ring and was wearing saffron-coloured Asian clothing. Supt Chaudhry added: ‘This continues to be a fast moving investigation. At the moment, we are treating this as a fatal road traffic collision. ‘We have currently not had reports of any missing people in the area, and we would urge anyone who has concerns to call us as soon as possible. ‘We have therefore released this description in an effort to try and identify the woman who has lost her life in what are clearly tragic circumstances.’","Asian man witnessed calmly picking up possessions and walking off .

"By . Rob Preece . PUBLISHED: . 08:41 EST, 11 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 01:47 EST, 12 June 2012 . Ousted Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak's health has deteriorated further in prison, it emerged today. Doctors treating the former president have had to use a defibrillator twice and feed him liquids intravenously, Egyptian security officials said. The 84-year-old's condition has declined rapidly since he was last seen publicly eight days ago, when he was jailed for life. In decline: Former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's health is said to have deteriorated since he was pictured at his trial last month . He was imprisoned for failing to stop the killing of hundreds of demonstrators as his regime crumbled during last year's Arab Spring. The security officials said Mubarak's two sons, one-time heir apparent Gamal and wealthy businessman Alaa, were by his side at the intensive care ward of Torah prison hospital, south of Cairo. Speaking on condition of anonymity, they did not say whether the defibrillator was used because Mubarak's heart stopped or to remedy irregular heartbeats. He has reportedly suffered from breathing problems since his sentence was passed, with doctors having to use a respirator to help him. Health problems: Mubarak looked stony-faced during his last public appearance, at the conclusion of his trial eight days ago . The update on Mubarak's condition came a day after authorities granted his wife, former first lady Suzanne Mubarak, and the couple's two daughters-in-law special permission to visit him. Mubarak ruled Egypt for almost 30 years, but his authoritarian regime was overthrown in February last year after tens of thousands of protesters demonstrated in Cairo's Tahrir Square and elsewhere. Demonstrators returned to the square last week after Mubarak was jailed for life but cleared of corruption. After a year-long trial, which the former leader attended in his hospital bed, a court convicted him of complicity in the killing of 850 demonstrators. Gamal and Alaa were acquitted of corruption charges but are also being held in Torah, awaiting a separate trial on charges of insider trading. Anger: Demonstrators staged protests after Mubarak was jailed for life but cleared of corruption . The verdicts sparked a new wave of protests by Egyptians who allege it was determined by political pressure from the country's military rulers, helping their former president. Protesters chanted: 'A farce a farce, this trial is a farce' and 'The people want execution of the murderer'. Mubarak is the first Arab leader to be tried by his own people. His life sentence saw him transferred immediately to a prison hospital, instead of the military hospital and other facilities where he had been held since his April 2011 arrest. Authorities are said to have turned down several requests by Mubarak's family to transfer the ousted president back to a military facility. Mubarak, a former military commander, came to power in 1981 following the assassination of President Anwar El Sadat. His regime was widely unpopular, but observers say conditions in Egypt have deteriorated since he was deposed. The country has been hit by a wave of deadly protests and strikes, battering its economy.

"Learco Chindamo made comments during robbery trial . Mr Lawrence, 48, was killed outside his school in 1995 . By . Rebecca Camber . UPDATED: . 19:19 EST, 18 August 2011 . Brutal: Chindamo has finally revealed how he killed headteacher Philip Lawrence . In an Old Bailey trial which shocked the nation, teenager Learco Chindamo stood expressionless just feet from Frances Lawrence and denied murdering her husband Philip. Yesterday, 15 years on, he admitted he lied and described for the first time the moment he killed the headmaster and father of four. ‘He (Mr Lawrence) tapped me on the shoulder a second time and I stabbed him,’ Chindamo told a court, later adding: ‘I know what I’ve done was a terrible thing.’ The killer, 30, who despite his denial was convicted and jailed for a minimum of 12 years, is now on trial for an alleged mugging only four months after being released on parole. He gave Blackfriars Crown Court a tearful account of his ‘selfish’ lies at the 1996 murder trial as he sought to defend accusations that he boasted of the killing during the alleged robbery last year. Prosecutors say he asked the victim: ‘Do you know who I am? Do you remember about the head teacher in Maida Vale?’ Chindamo, who did not give evidence at his murder trial, told how on December 8, 1995, aged 15 he went with others to St George’s Roman Catholic School, in Maida Vale, North-West London, to sort out ‘trouble’ with a pupil. It led to a fight outside the school. He said he had joined a gang and ‘was doing a lot of bad things’. And he described the moment he knifed Mr Lawrence when the headmaster tried to break up the fight. ‘He (Mr Lawrence) followed me and my group. I struck him with my hand. As he tapped my shoulder I struck him and I’ve kicked him as well. I think I said: “**** off, leave me alone,” something along those lines. Defending a pupil: Headmaster Philip Lawrence was stabbed to death outside St George's Roman Catholic School in Maida Vale, west London . ‘He tapped me on the shoulder a second time. I stabbed him.’ Clutching the side of the dock, the defendant took a sip of water before calmly continuing. 'Remorse': Learco Chindamo, spoke for the first time about killing the headteacher in 1995 at Blackfriars Crown Court . ‘I’ve . turned around as he’s tapped me on the shoulder and I’ve stabbed him in . the chest,’ he said. ‘He’s gone to dodge it and it’s gone into his . arm.’ The blow to the chest punctured the 48-year-old’s heart and he collapsed and died nearby. Tyrone Smith, defending, asked Chindamo: ‘You knew that you were responsible for killing this man. When you were interviewed on that day, did you admit the offence?’ ‘No,’ he replied. Mr Smith continued: ‘You knew that Mr Lawrence had a widow and a young family, yet you didn’t do the decent thing and plead guilty to what you’d done?’ Chindamo admitted he had lied at his trial. But he was found guilty and jailed for life by a judge who recommended a minimum of 12 years before parole. Yesterday the defendant admitted his denial was ‘entirely selfish’.‘I was afraid of going to prison for a very long time,’ he said. ‘I was afraid that my mother and my family would disown me. I was scared. I was 15 years old. I know that’s not an excuse.’ He said it was only when an appeal failed and he lost all hope that he could ‘get off’, that he finally confessed to his mother. Back on the streets: Learco Chindamo was released to live in Catford, south London, after serving 14 years for the murder of Philip Lawrence . Following his conviction, Chindamo faced deportation to his native Italy, where his father was serving a prison sentence. But an Asylum and Immigration Tribunal decided not to deport him on the grounds of his human rights. Yesterday Chindamo said: ‘I can understand why people would want me deported. I killed someone, I wasn’t born here. Who cares, I’ve killed someone. But my family live here. I don’t know anyone in Italy.’ Mr Smith said prison reports showed his client was remorseful and Chindamo had written a letter of apology to Mr Lawrence’s widow and children, although the authorities deemed it ‘inappropriate’ to send it. The defence barrister asked him: ‘Do you recognise the damage and loss your actions have caused to them?’ Mugging: The cash-point at Sainsburys in Camden, north London, where 20-year-old David Sexton was robbed . Tribute: St George's Roman Catholic School in Maida Vale where a plaque commemorates headmaster Phillip Lawrence . ‘Yes,’ replied Chindamo, adding: ‘I know what I’ve done was a terrible thing. A horrible thing.’ Prosecutors claim Chindamo mugged David Sexton, 20, forcing him to hand over money for ‘disrespecting’ him as he withdrew cash in Camden, North London. Gregory Jananto, 32, and Saeed Akhtar, 32, are also accused of robbery. But Chindamo claims Mr Sexton started the row by calling him a ‘killer’ after recognising him. He admits taking money but claims Mr Sexton offered him £10 during the incident on November 13 last year. The defendants all deny robbery. The trial continues.","Learco Chindamo made comments during robbery trial .

A controversial new book encourages young Germans to quiz their grandparents about how much they knew about the horrors of Nazism in World War Two. In his new work ‘My Grandfather in the War’ historian Moritz Pfeiffer claims that a staggering 20 to 25 million German citizens and 10 million soldiers were aware of the Nazi extermination programme. According to the German magazine Der Spiegel Mr Pfeiffer said his goal was to smash the last taboo in society so families across the country acknowledge the guilt of grandparents who supported Hitler. Concentration camp: Scenes from the liberation of Belsen in April 1945. Young Germans are being encouraged to ask their grandparents about how much they were really aware of the holocaust in World War Two . The historian who works at a museum on the S.S. at Wewelsburg Castle said times had changed significantly compared with the decades immediately after the war with eyewitnesses from the period now keen to share their memories and feelings as they approach the end of their lives. He said: ‘Immediately after the war, conversations about it between parents and children appear to have been impossible because it was all too fresh. ‘Now the problem is that no one is listening to that generation anymore. As a source of information, one's relatives are largely being ignored. But one day it will be too late.’ The historian interviewed his own maternal grandparents about their role in the war before cross-referencing their recollections against historical documents including army records and archived material. The result, according to the magazine, ‘is a book that has shed new light on the generation that unquestioningly followed Hitler, failed to own up to its guilt in the immediate aftermath of the war and, more than six decades on, remains unable to express personal remorse for the civilian casualties of Hitler's war of aggression, let alone for the Holocaust. Appalling scenes: In his new book historian Moritz Pfeiffer claims that as many as 25 million Germans were aware of the Nazi attrocities taking place against Jews . Mr Pfeiffer says his own blood relatives were morally ‘contaminated,’ like millions of ordinary Germans of that period. He describes his grandmother Edith as a 'committed, almost fanatical Nazi,' adding: ‘No One Can Say What They Would Have Done. But the project wasn't an attempt to pass judgment on them but to understand them. ‘I believe that people will learn a lot if they understand how their respected and loved parents or grandparents behaved in the face of a totalitarian dictatorship and murderous racial ideology. ‘Dealing with one's family history in the Nazi period in an open, factual and self-critical way is an important contribution to accepting democracy and avoiding a repeat of what happened between 1933 and 1945.’ His grandfather, identified only as Hans Hermann K., was a career soldier who, Pfeiffer discovered, gave evasive answers to his enquiries about his wartime service when massacres of civilians were carried out in Poland and Russia. When asked by his grandson if he thought Nazi racial laws banning Jews from public life and systematically expropriating their property were unfair, he said: ‘No, we didn't regard that as injustice, we had to go with the times and the times were like that. The media didn't have the importance then that they do today.’ Mr Pfeffer said his grandfather's claims of ignorance of massacres in Russia were ‘hardly believable.’ He added: ‘Grandfather wasn't lying outright in his interviews, but merely doing what millions of Germans had done after the war -- engaging in denial, playing down their role to lessen their responsibility. ‘It led to the convenient myth in the immediate aftermath of the war that the entire nation had been duped by a small clique of criminals who bore sole responsibility for the Holocaust -- and that ordinary Germans had themselves been victims. ‘Why did the humanity of my grandparents not rebel against the mass murders and why didn't my grandfather concede guilt or shame or express any sympathy for the victims?' He says the overriding aim of his book is to get other Germans to question their families before it is too late. ‘I think conversations like the ones I carried out will bring relatives together rather than drive a wedge between them,’ he added.","Up to 25 million German citizens aware of holocaust .

Officials seized three pairs of shoes left outside a practising Muslim’s council flat because they posed a fire hazard. Olcay Kurulay thought his two pairs of trainers and work shoes had been stolen when he opened his front door to find them gone from the communal hallway. But the 35-year-old, who keeps his shoes outside for religious reasons, was stunned after a neighbour told him a council housing officer had removed them. Olcay Kurulay (pictured) thought his two pairs of trainers and work shoes had been stolen when he opened his front door to find them gone from the communal hallway . He was even more shocked after he called the local authority and was told the footwear could have presented an obstacle to people in the event of a fire. They then charged him a £25 fee to get his property back. Hygiene is very important to practising Muslims who generally take their shoes off when entering mosques and homes to keep the areas clean and as a mark of respect. Mr Kurulay, a security guard at his local magistrates’ court, had to go to work wearing flip-flops and was given a ticking off by his boss. He believes his shoes - which included a pair of Nike and Adidas trainers - were taken by the officious council worker minutes before he was due to leave for work. Mr Kurulay, who is Turkish but now lives in Bournemouth, Dorset, said: 'I was ready to go to work and dressed in my uniform and went to put my shoes on and realised they had gone. 'I thought they had been stolen but then somebody told me a council officer had taken them. 'I was due to leave for work at 10.30am so the officer must have taken them up to 90 minutes beforehand. 'Why they couldn’t have just knocked on my door to tell me there was a problem I don’t know. 'I had to go to work wearing my black flip-flops and was told off by my manager for not wearing proper shoes. 'I called the council later and was told that you can’t have any items in the communal area in case of a fire. 'They didn’t think that by taking my shoes that might stop me leaving my flat if there was a fire. 'I told them that there was a doormat outside my flat and the guy from the council told me that I needed that, but I didn’t need my shoes? I doesn’t make sense. 'The council told me they didn’t have to give me any warning and that it was part of my tenancy agreement not to have any objects blocking the hallway. 'By that I thought they meant an old fridge or bicycle. 'It was just completely unnecessary.' He said: 'For religious reasons we cannot take shoes inside the house. 'People are sick outside or spit on the floor and there is also dog mess. We leave shoes because we pray inside.' He said a council officer inspected the communal areas of the block of flats two weeks ago and nothing was mentioned then, although a neighbour had to remove a pot plant. A spokesman for Bournemouth Borough Council said the tenancy agreement forbids tenants from storing personal items in communal areas. He added: 'We appreciate that it is customary in the Islamic faith to have a space allocated for footwear in the property before entering the private area. 'In this case it is understood to be the entrance hallway of the flat itself. 'The flat effectively ends at the communal hallway which, for fire evacuation purposes, must be kept completely clear.'","Olcay Kurulay was charged £25 to get his shoes back after the council said they were a fire hazard .

Since 2010 the local government has encouraged locals to grow tobacco rather than traditional crops due to its high return. Now the county has more than 24,000 hectares of tobacco land with 46,000 households growing it. Livelihood: Rows of tobacco fields are seen in Wuning County, southwest China's Guizhou Province. Since 2010 the local government has encouraged locals to grow tobacco rather than traditional crops due to its high return . Profits: While it is the major crop for millions of Chinese farmers, growing tobacco, is not as profitable as cotton or sugar cane . And there are now plans to expand the growth of tobacco further in the next few years to 140,000 hectares, nearly 6 times the amount grown now. While it is the major crop for millions of Chinese farmers, growing tobacco, is not as profitable as cotton or sugar cane. This is because the Chinese government sets the market price and while this price is guaranteed, it is lower than the natural market price.

According to the report China accounts for about 40% of global production and consumption of tobacco -  it is now the world's biggest producer and consumer.

Terror: Victoria Ratheram in the nursery of her house, where she was threatened by robbers in Woolerton, near Market Drayton, Shropshire . A heavily pregnant mother has told how she was tied up at knifepoint in front of her three-year-old son by a machete-wielding gang who ransacked her rural home. Victoria Ratheram was alone in her detached home with her son when the raiders, also armed with a truncheon, burst in. One of the robbers held the machete to her face, telling her: ‘Don’t scream.’ Mrs Ratheram, who is eight months pregnant, told the Daily Mail yesterday: ‘My son Oliver was right next to me, playing with his toy car. I just told him, “Do as mummy says, everything is fine”. ‘I knew I had to stay calm for him, but underneath I was absolutely terrified.’ The 28-year-old mother was then tied to a chair in the nursery which she and her husband James had prepared for the new baby. The robbers even frisked her around her pregnant stomach to see if she was hiding a phone they could steal. ‘I was absolutely terrified,’ Mrs Ratheram said. ‘All I could think about was my son and my unborn baby. I thought, “Let them do what they want, nothing in the house matters. Just please don’t let them hurt my son, please don’t let them hurt my baby”.’ The gang also targeted the couple’s neighbours during the raid, leaving a getaway car on the outskirts of the tiny village. They burst into the Ratherhams’ home in Wollerton, Shropshire, at 9.30am last Thursday. ‘I was in my home with Oliver and my husband had gone to work,’ said Mrs Ratheram, a full time mother. ‘Suddenly my dogs started barking and I saw the front door was open. The next minute I saw three men, one with his face covered, one with a machete and one with what looked like an old-fashioned wooden police truncheon. Traumatised: Robbers held a knife to the face of the 28-year-old, pictured right with husband James . ‘The guy with the machete held it to my face, and said, “Don’t scream, and we won’t hurt you”. They also threatened to hurt my dog. They kept asking, “Where’s your safe, where’s your safe?” I told them we didn’t have one and they said, “If we find out you’re lying, there will be trouble”.’ As one raider ransacked the house, another tied Mrs Ratheram’s hands and feet. He then forced her at knifepoint on to a chair in the nursery. The man with the machete then patted around her stomach to see if she was hiding a phone or any other valuable. ‘That made me feel physically sick,’ said Mrs Ratheram. ‘It was horrible.’ The robbers drew the curtains and left her in the nursery, telling her not to shout or scream or they ‘would be back’. ‘At that point, I didn’t know if they were planning to come back or whether they were going to hurt us or what,’ she said. ‘The man with the machete had said he was going to wait for us so I was too scared to shout or scream. I just wanted to hold my son but my hands were tied. He was climbing on the new baby’s cot and I just thought, if he falls, I can’t catch him. It was horrendous.’ Targeted: The family's £200,000 home in the village of Wollerton . Once the gang had left, Mrs Ratheram’s alsatian Bella tried to gnaw through the ties on her feet to let her free. ‘She must have sensed I was in danger, because she never left my side,’ said Mrs Ratheram. ‘She even tried to lunge at the robbers at one point. I was terrified they’d hurt her in front of my son because he loves her so much.’ Mrs Ratheram and her son were found ten minutes later by a neighbour’s daughter, who went to check on them after seeing the door open. She cut Mrs Ratheram free with kitchen scissors before going to check on the couple’s next door neighbours, who had also been targeted by the raiders. ‘I was only tied up there about ten minutes, but it felt like a lot longer,’ Mrs Ratheram said. ‘As soon as my hands were free I picked up my son. I can hardly describe the relief that we were all right. ‘The first thing I thought was that I just had to get out of the house there and then. I just picked Oliver up and I ran. As soon as I stepped outside, I saw the police and I just thought, “Thank God”.’ Astonishingly, the raiders took nothing other than the couple’s several mobile phones. They even left her handbag, which was in the kitchen with her purse inside. Loyal: Mrs Ratheram in the nursery with her alsatian Bella, who tried to free her mistress by gnawing through her ties . Mrs Ratheram said her son had not been too traumatised. ‘One of the raiders told him it was a game, which is one thing I am grateful for,’ she said. ‘He hasn’t mentioned it and I don’t think he really understood what happened at all.’ But she said that she herself had been left ‘completely traumatised’. ‘I’m not in a good way,’ she said. ‘I’m jumpy and I get really anxious. I’m not sleeping at all. ‘My dad’s upped the security on my house, but it still frightens the living daylights out of me when people ring the doorbell. I feel physically sick at about 9.30 in the mornings, for about that period of time when they came and did it. ‘I get my dog to sleep next to the door, my gates have been padlocked and I won’t let my husband go to work because I’m scared to be in the house on my own for the whole day.’ Mrs Ratheram, who worked at a stables before becoming a full-time mother, and her 32-year-old husband, an online marketing manager, have lived in the village all their lives and married four years ago. They went for a check-up on their unborn baby on Saturday, and were relieved to find that all was well. The expectant mother vowed she would not to be forced out of the £200,000 cottage where she and her husband keep horses, rabbits, dogs and cats. Shattering the peace: The burglars said they would hurt Mrs Ratheram and her pet dogs if she did not do as they told her . ‘I don’t feel safe in my own home now, but I will not let these men make me leave my house,’ she said. ‘I have no intention of letting these people make me move. It is my home, not theirs.’ Mr Ratheram said: ‘Victoria was really brave. I have no idea how she kept so calm but I know she will have been just thinking about our son. I’m really proud of her. ‘It’s been a horrible experience for her. It’s a really quiet village and we never thought anything like that would happen.’ The Ratherams were the first of two families targeted by the robbers in two separate raids in broad daylight on Thursday. In the second raid, a woman and her teenage son were attacked, leaving the teenager with a cut to his hand which needed an operation. The burglars are understood to have taken laptops and mobile phones from the second property, as well as a black Land Rover Discovery, which they abandoned on the outskirts of the village for another vehicle. The raids have stunned villagers. Paul Morris, 49, a childcare support manager, who saw Mrs Ratheram outside her home, said: ‘She was shaking and crying. She must have been absolutely terrified.’ Police want to trace a silver saloon car seen in the village from about 6am on the day of the attack which they think the gang may have used after dumping the Discovery.

The court battle between supermodel Linda Evangelista and billionaire Francois-Henri Pinault over child support has ended as both parties announcing their acceptance of a deal. 'We are happy that we were able to reach an agreement for the benefit and well-being of our son, Augie,' Evangelista and Francois-Henri Pinault said in a statement issued through a spokesman. The former couple had been in an extensive legal process over how much Pinault should pay Evangelista for the care of their 5-year-old son. Conservative: Linda Evangelista leaves New York Family court, while ex-lover Francois-Henri Pinault is seen right at Roissy Charles De Gaulle international airport yesterday . Businesslike: Unlike prior appearances where she wore floral dresses, Evangelista opted for a sombre skirt suit on Tuesday . A Manhattan magistrate signed off on their agreement Tuesday and sealed it from public view. Evangelista, one of the biggest names in modeling in the late 1980s and early '90s, reached the pact Monday with Pinault, who runs a luxury-goods conglomerate and is now married to actress Salma Hayek. The settlement came in the midst of a trial that delved into their finances and personal lives, particularly the cost of living for the model and her son as she initially asked for $46,000 per month from the boy’s father. The trial forced both to testify in open court about touchy subjects, ranging from Pinault discussing Hayek's difficult 2007 pregnancy to Evangelista talking about how much she still commands for modelling jobs.

A woman whose charred remains were found dumped in an old fire pit was named today as a single mother who had been missing for almost three years. Paula Hounslea was 38 when she vanished in August 2009 after a family meal to celebrate her mother’s birthday. Her remains were found by a dog walker last week, apparently dumped 12 feet down an embankment in the fire pit close to a disused railway line now a cycle path in Fazakerley, Liverpool. Police investigating her death believe her body may have been dumped as recently as February this year. Officers recovered a gold necklace with the face of the Virgin Mary next to the body and Paula’s parents got in touch when they noticed it pictured in a local newspaper. Police then identified Paula’s bones using dental records. A specialist pathologist and anthropologist was called into examined the body to try and establish how, when and where she died. The grim discovery was made just three days after Paula’s parents Steve and Moira made an emotional public appeal for information about her whereabouts. Officers are now urging locals to come forward with information about a suspicious fire in the area in the past year. Her disappearance also featured and was discussed by presenter Gloria Hunniford on ITV1’s This Morning show. Today, Merseyside Police confirmed the death was being treated as 'unexplained' and refused to rule out foul play.

Macabre: The fire pit down an embankment where the charred skeleton of Paula Hounslea was found three years after her disappearance . Tests have shown someone could have set fire to the body whilst it was at the site. The mystery began on Saturday, August 22, 2009 after Paula her brother and two sisters gathered for a meal at a Chinese restaurant for their birthday of their mother Moira. Her family dropped her at her home in West Derby and waved goodnight, but the following morning Paula went into her teenage daughter Lois’s bedroom to tell her she was going to 'stay with a friend' for a few days. She never turned up and, although there were cash withdrawals from her account in Liverpool in the first ten days after she went missing, there have been no leads since. It emerged she had texted her friend to say she 'needed to go away for a few days' but was never seen again. Macabre: Paula's body was found down an embankment in the fire pit close to a disused railway line, which is now a cycle path (above) in Fazakerley, Liverpool . Usually Paula rang her parents several times a day, but when her family tried to ring her there was no answer from her mobile phone. It also transpired Paula had tried to call a friend the Tuesday after she went missing but problems with the phone meant she was unable to connect. She also attempted to book a room at a local hotel but never arrived. Lois, now 21 has since given birth to a . daughter Erin now aged three months. During inquiries police believed . Paula might have moved to Benidorm in Spain to find bar work but . inquiries drew a blank. In a . recent appeal, Paula’s daughter Lois said: 'I’m living on my own in our . house. I miss her so much and want her to come home. If anyone has seen . her or knows where she is, please get in touch.' In . his appeal on May 2, Paula’s father Steve, 68, a former delivery driver . also offered a reward for information about his daughter’s whereabouts . saying: 'You just feel in limbo.

'We feel that somebody in Liverpool must know something and if we offer the reward maybe they’ll come forward and give us that information. 'If anybody knows anything, please, we would love to have some good news. Just to know that she is safe would be absolutely brilliant. She has the cheekiest of smiles. I believe one day I’ll see it again. He added: 'On reflection on the night before she disappeared, Paula was a bit quiet but other than that there was no indication there was anything wrong. 'She could be the most bubbly of people and generous to a fault. If you remarked you liked something she was wearing she’d hand it over; she’d give you the clothes from her back. For her to disappear was completely out of the blue.' 'Our house was searched and Paula’s home too, but there was no clue found as to what might have happened. 'We were asked the same things again and again. Her closest friends were spoken to but nothing came to light as to why she might have gone. It was a true mystery.' 'Paula’s a gran now. She should be cuddling her new granddaughter and forming a bond. It’s been hard for Lois, knowing she should be sharing that special time with her mum.'

The Euro crisis has delivered a bonus for British holidaymakers who can expect 10.5 per cent more spending power on the Spanish islands or French resorts. For every £500 converted to euros, a family will get an extra £47.41 this year compared to the summer of 2011. That means more ice creams for the children, a glass of wine or two more with meals or entry to an attraction or theme park. For those travelling further afield, the relative strength of sterling against other currencies will deliver an even bigger increase in spending power. Bonus: British holidaymakers can expect 10.5 per cent more spending power on the Spanish islands or French resorts due to the Euro crisis . For example, someone travelling to Rio in Brazil will get 24.5 per cent more for their money this year, or around an extra £86 for every £500 that is converted to the local currency, the real. Similarly, the pound will buy 15.7 per cent more Mexican pesos, delivering extra spending power to the many Britons who holiday in Cancun or the Riviera Maya. Visitors to South Africa will get 16.7 per cent more for their money this year. If you are thinking of taking a cheap holiday to Greece, it’s worth taking precautions in case the country leaves the euro while you are there. Even if Greece decides to quit the euro today, it’s unlikely the currency will stop becoming legal tender immediately. It will take time for a new currency, such as the old drachma, to come back in. For trips soon, any currency bought should be safe. But experts advise taking a few extra hundred euros in cash than you normally would. This is because of fears that cash machines and electronic banking systems could freeze up for days if Greece crashed out of the euro. And try to split your euros into smaller notes. However, there is a further concern. Each country in the euro has its own marked coins and notes. To the untrained eye, there is little difference between a Spanish €1 coin and a Greek €1 coin, and they are also accepted in any other eurozone country as a matter of course. The fear is that should Greece withdraw from the euro, the ‘Greek euros’ may stop being accepted in other countries or be worth less than the normal euro. However, experts say this is highly unlikely as it would be practically impossible to administer. While holidays in the Euro zone will be relatively cheaper in terms of daily spending, the strength of the pound against other European currencies has been even more marked. For example, the pound is now some 23 per cent stronger against the Polish zloty than the summer of 2011, while it is 20.8 per cent stronger against the Hungarian forint. Money will also go further this year in Turkey and Croatia. The figures, which have been collated by Post Office Travel Money, will encourage many families to make their summer holiday choices based on where they can best value. At the same time, many may decide to buy their summer spending money now to take advantage of the good rates. The Post Office research shows the pound has made gains against 24 of 30 leading holiday currencies over the past year. Compared to a year ago, the pound is down by 0.7 per cent against the dollar, 1 per cent against the Barbados dollar, 1.1 per cent against the Vietnamese dong, 1.8 per cent against the UAE dirham and 4.1 per cent against the Kenyan shilling. Post Office Head of Travel Money, Andrew Brown, said: ‘Although the increasing value of sterling against the euro has dominated the headlines, there are very few places where the pound is not packing a stronger punch this year. 'Our advice is for people to keep a close eye on exchange rates for all the destinations they are considering so they can judge where they will get the best return on their money.'

"Now she devotes herself to worship as a nun at the Abbey of Regina Laudis in Connecticut . By . Neil Sears . PUBLISHED: . 17:41 EST, 29 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 20:19 EST, 30 April 2012 . High life: Laura Adshead at a charity event at Tiffany's in New York in 2003 before she turned to the convent . Standing in her pearls on the diamond floor at Tiffany’s, Laura Adshead looks every inch the socialite. Given her privileged upbringing, it certainly wouldn’t surprise anyone to learn that the high-flyer, educated at Oxford and Cheltenham Ladies’ College, was once the girlfriend of David Cameron. But it might come as a bit of a jolt to discover that a few years after this picture was taken she decided to reject her life of worldly ambition – and become a Benedictine nun. The curious story of Miss Adshead, 44 – now Sister John Mary – has been revealed following her appearance in a recent documentary about the convent she joined. In it she reveals how she turned to Christ after becoming lost in drink and drug addiction during years of hard partying in New York. She said: ‘I did think my life would progress on the normal tracks of meeting someone, marrying, having children, but that’s not the path that God has led me.’ Reflecting on photographs from her wild years she added: ‘I feel like I tried most things in life that are supposed to make you happy. That journey took me down into alcoholism and drug addiction.’ These days she devotes herself to worship and work with the other nuns of the Abbey of Regina Laudis in Connecticut. As a novice, her chores include mopping the chapel floors and tending cattle in the abbey grounds. Born in New Zealand to British parents, Miss Adshead studied at £24,000-a-year Cheltenham before winning a place at Christchurch, Oxford, and meeting fellow undergraduate Mr Cameron. By the spring of 1990 they were an item, and remained together until the summer of the following year. For a time both worked at Conservative Central Office, before she became prime minister John Major’s correspondence secretary. She was a leading figure in promoting the then-premier’s controversially pro-European policies, earning herself the nickname Miss Maastricht. She took the end of her romance with Mr Cameron hard and reportedly had to take time off work. After a dalliance with leading Conservative-supporting historian Andrew Roberts, a close friend of Mr Cameron, she sought a new start. In early 1993 she applied to Right-wing think tanks in Washington DC, a newspaper diary column noted, to the disappointment of the ‘young swains’ at Conservative Central Office, who had been ‘in a state of bewitchment’ over ‘starlet’ Miss Adshead. Early lives: Laura Adshead in her old life and David Cameron during his time at Brasenose College, Oxford University . It had been claimed she briefly spent some time in a Catholic retreat in America in the early 1990s, but at the same time went on to gain an MBA. She then worked in a senior role for advertising agency Ogilvy and Mather – the inspiration for the Mad Men TV series – helping to sell everything from mops to cat food. Miss Adshead attended charity balls in New York alongside Prince Albert of Monaco, and holidayed at the exclusive Hamptons resort nearby on the coast, staying in a £4,000-a-week summer home with high-flying friends. She boasted in newspaper interviews of . attending polo matches, just like in England, except ‘the weather is . better here and the people are more attractive’. The ex who found God: Sister John Mary features in new documentary God is the Bigger Elvis . She has publicly admitted that she was increasingly abusing alcohol and drugs. First she joined Alcoholics Anonymous – then, in 2008, decided to wed herself to Christ.

A bitter family custody battle over the remains of Caroll Shelby - famed as the father of muscle cars - has left his body in a mortuary until a court ends the row. The surviving wife of seven-times-married Shelby is locked in a dispute with his family over how to lay the legendary car designer to rest. Cleo Shelby, 64, has demanded to take charge of what happens to her husband’s body, while his children say they are following their father’s last wishes to have him cremated. Father of muscle cars: The late Caroll Shelby, posing with the 2007 Ford Shelby GT Mustang he helped design, helped create some of world's most iconic sports cars . And the dispute is now set to be decided in a Texas courtroom. The body of Shelby - who is best know for creating some of the most iconic sports cars including the AC Cobra, also known as the Shelby Cobra - has been in a mortuary since his death aged 89 in May 10, this year. Row: The dispute over how to lay the body of Caroll Shelby to rest looks set to be decided in court . Eldest son Michael Shelby has submitted a document to the court purporting to be written instructions from his father saying that he wants to be cremated and giving him powers to arrange his funeral. According to dallasnews.com his instructions, signed and dates on February 8, were for his ashes to be ‘divided equally among and given to each of my then living children and one additional equal share to be buried in my parents’ family plot in Leesburg, Texas.’ But Mrs Shelby had lodged a court petition alleging this document is ‘forged’. She has demanded to be given the final say on what arrangements should be made for the former racer turned car designer, who grew up in East Texas and attended high school in Dallas. Dallas County Medical Examiner Dr. Jeffrey Barnard, has said he is in control of the body ‘because an allegation was made which falls within’ Texas laws pertaining to criminal procedure. Michael Shelby, who donated a kidney to his father in 1996, discounted the forgery allegations, noting that the funeral instructions he received were witnessed by four people and a notary. He told dallastoday: ‘We are trying to honour Carroll Shelby’s wishes. ‘This is not a case of what the kids want vs. what the wife wants.’ Carrol Shelby, who enjoyed an eclectic mix of careers during his lifetime, accomplished considerable success on the racetrack behind the wheel of cars, winning France's grueling 24 Hours of Le Mans sports car race with teammate Ray Salvadori in 1959.

The . one-time chicken farmer was also champion race car driver, racing team . owner, automobile manufacturer, automotive consultant, safari tour . operator, raconteur, chili entrepreneur and philanthropist. But it was designing street legal and high-powered muscle cars that he made his name. He had turned to the race-car circuit in the 1950s after his chicken ranch failed. He won dozens of races in various classes throughout the 1950s and was twice named Sports Illustrated's Driver of the Year. Soon after his win at Le Mans, he gave . up racing and turned his attention to designing high-powered ‘muscle . cars’ that eventually became the Shelby Cobra and the Mustang Shelby . GT500.

He went on to have huge input into a host of modern road cars, including the relaunched Ford Mustang. Shelby's life was hampered by underlying health problems from birth. He suffered heart valve leakage problems from an early age and spent most of his childhood in bed. He took nitroglycerine pills when he was racing because of his heart. He had a heart transplant in 1990 and a kidney transplant in 1996.","Family wants to cremate Caroll Shelby but his seventh wife has lodged a court document preventing those funeral arrangements .

A Jewish leader has furiously accused the BBC of sensationalising a documentary about anti-Semitism in Poland. Jonathan Ornstein, director of Jewish Community Centre of Krakow, gave an interview for the Panorama programme entitled 'Stadiums of Hate' investigating racism at the upcoming Euro 2012 venues. Footage from the documentary showing anti-Semitic chants and racist monkey noises aimed at Black football players prompted former England captain Sol Campbell to warn fans not to travel to Poland and Ukraine otherwise 'you could end up coming back in a coffin.' Strong words: Jonathan Ornstein, director of Jewish Community Centre of Krakow, said he was 'exploited' during the interview . The programme also showed south Asian fans being attacked at one game and crowds giving Nazi salutes at another. But . Mr Ornstein says he was 'exploited' during the hour-long interview with . the corporation as it 'completely disregarded anything positive said . and aired only comments critical of Poland'. Mr . Ornstein, an American-born Jew who has lived in Poland for 11 years, . says the images used were also selective and other contributors . misrepresented. He also alleges his suggestion that . the broadcasters interviewed two Israeli footballers, who play for local . team Wisla Krakow, about their positive experiences were rejected after . being told 'it didn't fit their story'. 'I am furious at the way the BBC has exploited me as a source', he said. Mr Ornstein says the documentary misrepresented the views of two Israeli footballers who play for local team Wisla Krakow . 'The interview lasted approximately one hour during which I emphasized that the small number of football fans in Poland engaging in anti-Semitic and racist behaviour do not represent Polish society as a whole. 'The organization used me and others to manipulate the serious subject of anti-Semitism for its own sensationalist agenda; in doing so, the BBC has insulted all Polish people and done a disservice to the growing, thriving Jewish community of Poland.' John Godson, one of Poland's two black MPs, has also criticised the documentary, which first aired on May 28 and is repeated on the BBC News Channel, in a Polish magazine. He said: 'I believe that Poland is a . tolerant country. Very much on this matter has changed and continues to . change for the better. 'Poles . have ever more opportunity to come into contact with foreigners - such . as dark-skinned people - and that is better for them. Recall that in the .

A BBC spokesman said: 'Panorama strongly refutes Mr Ornstein's allegation that it misrepresented his interview in the programme, Euro 2012: Stadiums of Hate. 'It was made clear to Mr Ornstein that the interview was being carried out in the context of football related racism and anti-Semitism in Poland and his contribution was clearly placed in this context in the film. The programme stated in commentary that he believes that most Poles happily accept other faiths but that football hooligans are yet to catch up with wider Polish society.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 13:13 EST, 2 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 13:36 EST, 2 June 2012 . Stephen Lawrence, 18, was stabbed twice after he was attacked in Eltham, South London in 1993 . A new review has been ordered into claims police corruption impeded the original Stephen Lawrence murder investigation. Home Secretary Theresa May has appointed a leading barrister to carry out an independent probe,  despite Scotland Yard and the police watchdog, the IPCC, concluding last week they could find no new evidence. Mark Ellison, QC, who earlier this year secured the conviction of David Norris and Gary Dobson for the 1993 racist gang murder, in Eltham - 19 years after the crime - will head the review. The move was welcomed by Stephen’s mother Doreen, who had called for a fresh public inquiry after it was claimed the Metropolitan Police withheld paperwork about the extent of corruption from the Macpherson Inquiry. Mrs Lawrence told the Independent: ‘Whilst I asked for a public inquiry into these allegations, my discussions with the Home Secretary have reassured me that the independent review she has ordered will seek to deal with my concerns. ‘This is because firstly, it will be conducted by someone independent of both the police and the IPCC, organisations in which I have little faith and confidence, and secondly, the person conducting the review, Mark Ellison, QC, is someone who has already shown his commitment in getting justice for me and my family.’ The scope of the inquiry and the barrister who will be in charge have not yet been decided. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘The Home Secretary has asked for a QC-led review of the work the Metropolitan Police has undertaken into investigating claims of corruption in the original Stephen Lawrence murder investigation.’ The Met launched a review to examine the claims, while the Independent Police Complaints Commission reviewed its 2006 investigation into complaints following the broadcast that year of the BBC programme The Boys Who Killed Stephen Lawrence. Doreen Lawrence with her son Stuart at a memorial service last month - 19 years after Stephen was murdered . Officers from the Met's Directorate of Professional Standards looked at thousands of documents, many dating from the 1980s, from Met Police archives and from government archives in Kew, and spoke to serving and retired officers as well as the junior counsel for the MPS at the inquiry. The review found that no investigations, nor the inquiry, uncovered evidence of corruption or collusion which could have hampered or influenced the original or subsequent investigations. It also found that the force disclosed all material relating to ‘adverse information’ it had about three officers of concern, including those the claims surrounded. There was no other material known to . be held by the force which suggested that corruption or collusion . impacted on the initial investigation into Mr Lawrence's murder, and . there are no new allegations from the recent claims, the force said. Any allegations or suggestions had already been investigated by the Met and IPCC, it said. The . police watchdog said its review followed reports on allegations made by . former Met Police officer Neil Putnam about the relationship between . former Detective Sergeant John Davidson and Clifford Norris, David . Norris's father. Jailed: Gary Dobson, left, and David Norris, right, were sentenced to life in prison for the murder of Stephen Lawrence in April 1993 . But on Thursday the IPCC also said it found that no new information or evidence has been made available which would lead to a change in the conclusions reached by its original investigation into allegations made by the BBC documentary. Suspicion had fallen on the conduct and integrity of . former Metropolitan Police commander Ray Adams, who was involved in the original murder investigation, and his relationship with . Kenneth Noye, who was later convicted of a separate murder. Probe: Home Secretary Theresa May asked for a review the Met Police's previous investigations into corruption claims . No criminal or misconduct charges were brought as a result of the . internal investigation into Mr Adams, who says he was exonerated and . denies any wrongdoing. He was questioned at the Macpherson inquiry about corruption, but no evidence of wrongdoing was found. During the Macpherson inquiry, lawyers claimed Noye had a criminal . associate, Clifford Norris, whose son David was a prime suspect in the . murder of Stephen. It has also been claimed that another Scotland Yard officer, who . interviewed the suspects following Stephen’s killing, had links to . Clifford Norris. A leaked . Scotland Yard report alleged Detective Sergeant John Davidson, one of . the lead investigators in the initial botched inquiry, received corrupt . payments from Clifford Norris. Those allegations were investigated by . the IPCC which found no evidence that corruption had affected the . inquiry. Mr Davidson, has always denied wrongdoing. The Met investigation into Adams, . codenamed Operation Russell, began in April 1987 when he was working as . the force's head of criminal intelligence, according to the Guardian. It . was triggered by allegations that he had taken bribes from criminals . and had improper relationships with criminal informants - something he . strongly denied. There are claims that a confidential report . compiled by Scotland Yard's anti-corruption command was not disclosed to . the panel of the 1998 Macpherson inquiry that examined the forces . handling of the Stephen Lawrence case . Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: ‘I believe it is right that an independent review is undertaken into allegations of corruption at the time of the original investigation into the murder of Stephen Lawrence. ‘However I also feel that 13 years after the Macpherson report we should not only confront these allegations of corruption, but publicly review progress made in eliminating racism in the police service. ‘It was clear before the internal review undertaken by the Metropolitan Police into corruption and the Lawrence case that a public inquiry was needed. ‘So too it is clear that internal reports and work, though worthwhile, are not sufficient in such an important case. ‘After the history of problems in this case, everything possible should be done and be seen to be done to ensure the fullest possible confidence in the police investigations.’","Leading barrister asked to conduct review into claims Met Police hid full extent of corruption .

More than £5billion of revenue is 'at risk' because wealthy investors are ploughing money into film finance schemes to avoid tax, it emerged today. The partnerships can act as a big incentive for investors to support film projects, but also allow them to use any losses to offset taxes on other income. HM Revenue & Customs yesterday confirmed it was investigating 600 such schemes over concerns billions was being lost in tax revenue. Dodging tax: One investment scheme, which bought the rights to films including 1408 starring Samuel L Jackson, is helping 75 members avoid £18million in tax by switching their liabilities to Luxembourg, it has been claimed . The revelations came as David Cameron branded comedian Jimmy Carr 'morally wrong' for using a 'very dodgy' off-shore scheme to pay as little as one per cent income tax. After paying into a partnership tax-free, investors can take out a loan from the scheme – also tax-free. In theory the tax break is deferred until the partnership makes money, but some schemes offer the chance to avoid this. One film investment scheme called Terra Nova is helping 75 members avoid £18million in tax by switching their liabilities to Luxembourg, it has been claimed. One senior HMRC offical told The Times: 'Film schemes are a £5billion risk for us at least. 'Someone puts in money and then the film scheme promoter says ""We're going to lend you ten times that""... so all you do is generate tax relief and make a shedload of money for nothing.' 'Very dodgy': David Cameron has branded comedian Jimmy Carr (right) 'morally wrong' for using an off-shore scheme to pay tiny amounts of income tax . However, the tax relief is only deferred as any tax saved in the first year is expected to be returned as the film partnership starts to make money in the following years. Terra Nova investors claimed about £22million in tax relief in 2006 after buying the rights to films including 1408 starring Samuel L Jackson for arund £48million. They were due to pay back £18million in the next tax year, but were offered the chance to 'retire' from the partnership and move all liabilities to a Luxembourg-based company. According to Alastair McEwan, of Rebus Solutions, which represents people who believe they were missold investment schemes, says, although legal, such exit schemes are systemic and could cost the Exchequer millions. Senior HMRC official . Terra Nova was set up by Tim Levy, the founder of Future Capital Partners (FCP). Lawyers for FCP said restructuring in partnerships could happen for various reasons and that it did not make decisions on behalf of its partners. Yesterday, Mr Cameron said revelations about the multi-millionaire comedian's tax arrangements suggested Mr Carr is undertaking 'straightforward tax avoidance'. The PM's extraordinary broadside came as it emerged Carr paid cash for an £8.5million house in one of London’s most fashionable areas. Speaking to ITV News during his trip to Mexico, the Prime Minister attacked wealthy people who use off-shore schemes to dodge big tax bills. He said: 'I think some of these schemes - and I think particularly of the Jimmy Carr scheme - I have had time to read about and I just think this is completely wrong. 'There is nothing wrong with people planning their tax affairs to invest in their pension and plan for their retirement - that sort of tax management is fine. 'But some of these schemes we have seen are quite frankly morally wrong.'",HMRC investigating 600 partnerships which are placing £5bn of revenue 'at risk'

Casey Anthony is pinning hopes on turning her journals into a money-spinning, tell-all book, despite the fact major publishers have balked at the idea of working with her, it was claimed today. The 26-year-old has been keeping a diary ever since she was first put on trial last year for the murder of her daughter Caylee. She was acquitted in July of the two-year-old's murder but convicted of lesser charges including lying to police. Anthony is currently on probation in Florida but the . court has ordered her exact location to be kept a secret because of death threats. Dear diary: Casey Anthony at court during trial for the murder daughter Caylee of which she was acquitted. She is penning a memoir from her journals after becoming one of the most hated woman in America . She is said to spend her days inside, writing down her thoughts and editing past journals to find the best excerpts for her memoir. 'Make no mistake, Casey will absolutely be releasing a book, it's just a matter of time. Casey feels this is the only way that she can get her story out and she feels that the public wants to hear from her,' a source told RadarOnline. However several big publishers have shied away from the idea of publishing Anthony's book for fear of a public backlash. Her lawyer Cheney Mason told Piers Morgan on CNN last week that his client had no intention of writing a book. Anthony broke her silence after a year to tell the presenter during a phone conversation: 'I'm not making gazillions dollars. 'I don't give [an expletive] about money... I may have in past... I was a stupid kid. I am . 26 now. I have gone through hell.' Penning a memoir? Casey Anthony's last public appearance was in October when she posted a video of herself on YouTube . Gone: Anthony's toddler daughter Caylee, whose body was found in woods near Anthony's home in 2008 . However, her attorney Mason did add: 'We are sitting back watching... When the time comes she will have her story to tell.' It was initially speculated that Anthony . could command up to $750,000 for her first exclusive interview . following her trial, but the big four national networks and cable news . declined to pay that sum. The . infamous Florida mother, had teamed up with Los Angeles-based TV . producer Scott Sternberg to pitch an interview to all the networks. According . to the Hollywood Reporter, the interview had a price tag of $500,000 to . $750,000, but CBS News, ABC News and NBC News all stated they would not . pay for an interview with Anthony. Despite the denials from her lawyer, Anthony . was said to be desperately in need of money as her reputation as 'America's most hated mother' has left her unable to go out in public. She was also believed to want to change the public perception of herself. Anthony also told Morgan last week: 'I didn't kill my daughter...but I'm ashamed of the person that I was.' Caylee's body was found in woods near Anthony's home in 2008. After initially sticking by the claim that her daughter had been kidnapped, Anthony's lawyers then insisted at the start of the trial that Caylee had accidentally drowned in the family's swimming pool. Publishing deal: Casey Anthony's lawyer Jose Baez (pictured left) has a book coming out about the trial . It is this primary inconsistency in . her story that has sparked public outrage over the case and forced Anthony into hiding after her release. It was revealed that she has spent the ten months since the trial at home, cooking, cleaning, exercising and watching television. She has come to love old comedy shows . such as 'The Three Stooges' and 'I Love Lucy' and enjoys reading fiction, especially 'The Hunger Games' trilogy in . which children fight to the death in televised contests. Despite being vilified by the public, Anthony has not entirely shied away from publicity. In October she appeared in a video diary which she posted on YouTube. In it she said she was 'making changes for herself', although failed to mention Caylee. Her former lawyer Jose Baez is set to release a book in July called Presumed Guilty about defending his infamous client.  Baez reveals details about getting to know Anthony including her facial expressions and conversations. Anthony is not believed to be making any money from Baez's book. The tell-all is being released by Ben Bella - the publishing house which is also behind John Edwards' mistress Rielle Hunter's book about their illicit affair. What Really Happened: John Edwards, Our Daughter and Me is due to be released on June 26. It contains lurid details about the disgraced senator's affair with Ms Hunter while his wife Elizabeth was dying of cancer.","She spends days 'writing her diary and editing at Florida hideaway'

A couple who were told it would be ‘virtually impossible’ for them to conceive have had a baby with the help of a pioneering IVF technique – an incubator with built-in CCTV. Gemma and Simon Potter spent  four years trying for a child before  tests revealed that surgery Mr Potter had as a child had left him with a very low sperm count. The ‘heartbroken’ couple turned to IVF – and a revolutionary device called the  Embryoscope, which increases the chances of pregnancy by up to 50 per cent. First in line: Gemma and Simon Potter said the incubator may have helped them conceive on their first IVF cycle . The £100,000 machine, which looks like a microwave, mimics conditions in the womb to provide the perfect controlled environment for fertilisation. The development of the embryos is  monitored via CCTV, stopping the laboratory staff from having to remove them from the incubator to check on their progress, which can have a detrimental effect. Mrs Potter, 27, said: ‘When  the chance of having a family is ripped away from you, it is the worst thing imaginable. ‘We were heartbroken and felt such a failure. We had got married, bought our first house and now wanted a family.’ Fortunately, the couple’s first cycle of IVF in July, paid for by the NHS, was a success. Their daughter Isabella arrived three weeks ago weighing 6lb 2oz – one of the first babies to be born as a result of the new technique. Mrs Potter, a trainee teacher from Wigan, added: ‘We feel so privileged to be Isabella’s mum and dad. Modern technology: Embryologist Natalie Bowman looks at the time-lapse video created by the Embryoscope . The odds were stacked against us and we really feared it would never happen. 'But amazingly it worked first time and we are sure this new machine helped. She beat the odds and is our little miracle.' Mrs Potter and her husband, 33, a software engineer, had treatment at CARE in Manchester, which is the first fertility clinic in the UK to use the Embryoscope. The machine, which was developed by Danish company Unisense  and recently gained approval from the American Food and Drug Administration for clinical use in the U.S., has a built-in  microscope and camera system to allow round-the-clock monitoring of the embryos. Embryologist Samantha Duffy with baby Isabella: The Care clinic says the facility has boosted their pregnancy success rate by 44 per cent . Each one can be tracked until it is ready to be put into the mother’s womb, between three and five days after fertilisation. Alison Campbell, head of embryology at CARE, said: 'Currently, assessment of embryos in IVF is limited to brief snapshot glimpses at defined time points, usually one per day involving removal from the incubator. 'With the Embryoscope, images are taken every few minutes and viewed as  time-lapse video by the embryologists until the point of embryo transfer without removing them from incubation, usually three or five days later. 'The ability to study these images in a closed system allows us to select the most viable embryo for transfer into the patient, and exclude embryos that are not ideal for implantation.' In Mr and Mrs Potter’s case, only two of the six embryos created were deemed suitable for implantation. Research presented at the Association of Clinical Embryologists conference in Leeds earlier this year showed that the Embryoscope increases the chances of pregnancy by an average of 44 per cent compared with a standard incubator.",Another 74 women are pregnant thanks to the Embryoscope used at a Manchester clinic .

"The store saw sales up by 3.9% this year . Kate Middleton's favourite designer Jenny Packham takes sales crown as top occasionwear brand . By . Bianca London . PUBLISHED: . 07:42 EST, 29 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 16:57 EST, 29 June 2012 . Whatever the Duchess of Cambridge touches turns to gold. From the Zara cornflower blue dress to the vibrant pink jeans, her wardrobe choices have sent high-street sales soaring with shoppers desperate to emulate her impeccable style. And one high street store is reaping the rewards of the Kate effect as Debenhams sees sales up 3.9% with the Duchess's favourite label, Jenny Packham taking the sales crown as top occasionwear designer. Duchess of Cambridge arrives at Calgary Airport in a yellow Jenny Packham . At Royal Albert Hall wearing a teal Jenny Packham dress with lace detail . Kate arrives for the ARK Gala Dinner in extravagant rose sequined Jenny Packham gown . Figures released yesterday show the store's selling power against a challenging combination of bad weather and continuing economic uncertainty both at home and in the euro zone, meaning for other retailers many shoppers are staying at home. Debenhams' enviable sales growth, according to the retailer, is down to meeting the needs of customers and delivering value, especially around key events such as Easter, Mother’s Day, the Diamond Jubilee and pay days. Debenhams also invested in marketing to tell shoppers about these moments in time as well as continuing with its premium ‘Life Made Fabulous’ ad campaign. Online sales also grew by 34.9% and have increased by 40.2% this year with visitor numbers up by 40%. Debenhams sees sales up 3.9% despite the struggling economic climate . Michael Sharp, Debenhams’ chief executive said: 'Our like-for-like growth really shows that if you communicate and deliver great value and great products then customers will shop with you. I am really pleased with the results.' And it comes as no surprise that the designer that Kate Middleton put on the fashion radar is leading the pack. No.1 Jenny Packham is now the retailer’s leading occasionwear range following its launch in May when it joined Debenhams’ Designers at Debenhams portfolio. The British designer's collection, featured exclusively in Debenhams, was brought in to further enhance the retailer’s ethos of making fabulous designer ranges accessible on the High Street. It captures Jenny’s signature style in a collection of dresses, available in soft metallics, floral or intricate graphic prints and bold block colours. They feature Packham's signature wrapping, pleating and gentle draping of fabrics, in a variety of styles from floor-sweeping maxis to organza prom dresses. A range of accessories including bags, jewellery, shoes and occasion headwear will complement the dresses, with prices ranging from £18 to £100. Jenny Packham, who has shopped in the store all her life, took the crown as the top selling occasionwear . The store's top selling item this year was this gold embellished jersey waterfall dress, which can be snapped up for a reasonably priced £90 . The collaboration also sees Jenny’s first foray into childrenswear design, as the women’s collection is complemented by a capsule bridesmaid offer. The flower girl and bridesmaid dresses take Jenny’s signature elegance and attention to detail, to create charming pieces for children, featuring georgette, lace and intricate embellishment to add sparkle. Prices start from £48. The designer said: 'As a young girl I was regularly abandoned in Debenhams Southampton whilst my parents disappeared to search for the latest Teasmade or some other ‘must have’ electrical appliance. During this time I lost myself in the rails of 70’s polyester and dreamt of a life in fashion. 'Therefore it is only natural that I have chosen Debenhams to launch my first High Street collection. 'My aim always is to design styles that create glamour and excitement whether it is for the red carpet or a teenage prom.' 'My collaboration with Debenhams is a great opportunity for me to offer my signature style at an attainable price.' Packham joined the likes of Julien Macdonald, Roksanda Ilincic, Jonathan Saunders and Matthew Williamson who have also created capsule collections for the UK retailer. With the luxury brand boasting an elite fan base, Jenny Packham's purse-friendly pieces have proven to be a hit with price-conscious shoppers. Stars such as Rihanna, Keira Knightley, Beyonce and Cameron Diaz have been spotted in gowns from Jenny Packham. The most memorable piece worn by the Duchess of Cambridge being a £3,800 shimmering gown worn to the ARK charity gala last year. The store's top selling item this year was a gold embellished jersey waterfall dress, which can be snapped up for a reasonably priced £90. Debenhams' commitment to supporting the high street was also evident over the same time frame with nine modernisations in Middlesborough, Preston, . Harrow, Luton, Bournemouth, Colchester, Reading, and Harrogate completed, with Chester due to re-launch on the 6th July, with work also starting on nine more stores across the UK.","The store saw sales up by 3.9% this year .

Britain's largest card retailer, Clinton Cards is set to lose its fight for survival after its biggest supplier said it will force it into administration later today. The retailer, which employs more than 8,000 staff, operates 628 Clintons and 139 Birthdays stores, and has requested that its shares be suspended on the London Stock Exchange. The move comes after its banks - Barclays and taxpayer-backed Royal Bank of Scotland - sold the company’s £35 million of loans to its biggest supplier, American Greetings. High Street woes: Clintons is the UK's biggest card retailer and employs more than 8,000 staff . But whereas the banks had waived loan repayments, American Greetings has said it will push the company into administration today. The cards and gifts retailer expects to enter administration, becoming the latest casualty on the British high street after its biggest supplier American Greetings bought up loans from its banks and promptly called them in. Clinton Cards said in a statement announcing the suspension of trading in its shares that it had been in breach of some conditions attached to £35 million ($56.5 million) worth of loans and that it was not in a position to repay them. The group said it had been informed . overnight that its banks Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland, which had . given it temporary waivers over the breaches, had sold the loans. Clinton Cards said . that it had not been party to negotiations leading up to the deal but . that it had anticipated American Greetings would extend the waivers . granted by the banks and start talks with a view to supporting it. 'However, having secured control of the . debt, American Greetings immediately informed the board that it intended . to enforce the loan against the company and the board has concluded . that because it is unable to repay the loan it has no option but to . concur with American Greetings proposal to place the company and its . subsidiaries into administration,' the group said in Wednesday's . statement. Gloomy predictions: The company announced in March that it had slumped to a first half loss and warned that its prospects for the second half were worse than originally anticipated . Clintons's announcement follows a turbulent period for Britain's high street. Last month Mothercare axed 100 job when it closed 100 stores. Another of the U.K's iconic stores Woolworth's, folded in 2008 under huge debt. It was the first in a wave of closures that rocked the country's high streets. News of Woolworth's demise came on the same day as furniture chain MFI said it would be closing its doors. Store closures have become familiar news for the retail sector while a number of shops have announced plans to slim back their operations. Chocolate retailer Thorntons recently announced it is to close 180 of 579 stores over the next three years. The alcohol market has also been hit with off-licence group First Quench, which owns Threshers and Wine Rack, announcing it will close more than 750 stores in 2009 with the loss of nearly 2,000 jobs. Plus-sized womenswear chain Peacocks collapsed into administration in January, which will lead to 1,400 jobs across its stores. The firm, which trades from about 628 Clinton Cards stores and 139 Birthdays outlets, had been due to publish the results of a strategic review into how it will cope with tough trading conditions and intense competition from supermarkets and the Internet. The company announced in March that it had slumped to a first half loss and warned that its prospects for the second half were worse than originally anticipated. Shares in Clinton Cards, which have lost more than 80 per cent of their value since the start of 2010, closed at 6.75 pence on Tuesday, valuing the group at about 14 million pounds ($22.6 million). Nobody at American Greetings could immediately be reached for comment. With British shoppers' disposable incomes squeezed by rising prices, muted wage growth and government austerity measures, store chains have faced tough conditions, pushing a string of retailers to the brink. The chain was founded in 1968 when Don Lewin opened the first store in Epping in Essex. His son Clinton Lewin, who he named the store after, is currently the brand's managing director. In 1988 it had 77 stores when it . floated on the stock market. Its store numbers were swelled by numerous . acquisitions including Hallmark Cards and the Birthdays Group, which had . 170 stores, in 2004. The . news come as figures revealed today the wettest April on record dampened . demand for summer fashion as retailers suffered their biggest sales . falls for more than a year. Like-for-like . sales dropped a 'disappointing' 3.3 per cent - the worst performance . since March 2011 - driven by 'substantial' falls for clothes retailers . and the worst footwear trading since January 2008, the British Retail . Consortium (BRC) said. Family business: Clinton Lewin, managing director of Clinton Cards - the chain was founded in 1968 when his father Don Lewin opened the first store in Essex . Meanwhile Sainsbury’s hailed the success of its price-matching scheme today as it delivered a better than expected rise in annual profits. The UK’s third largest supermarket, which has more than 1,000 stores, said underlying profits increased 7.1 per cent to £712 million in the year to March 17, beating City forecasts for a 5 per cent rise. The group said overall sales excluding VAT rose 5.6 per cent to £22.3 billion, taking its market share to the highest level for nearly a decade at 16.6 per cent. It was helped by its Brand Match price scheme, which guarantees to match Asda and Tesco on 14,000 branded goods. However, the chain, which opened 73 Local convenience stores last year as part of 1.4 million sq ft of new space, said it will slow its rate of store expansion from just over 7 per cent to about 5 per cent in the current financial year. The group’s profits growth represents a slowdown on the 9% increase a year ago but is still much better than Tesco, which recently suffered its first fall in UK profits for 20 years, while Morrisons last week posted its first fall in like-for-like sales in seven years. The supermarket price war has gathered intensity in recent months after Asda launched a guarantee to be 10% cheaper than rivals, while Tesco staged its £500 million Big Price Drop campaign. But Sainsbury’s Brand Match scheme, launched in October, coupled with its Live Well For Less advertising campaign, has helped it out-perform the grocery market. Like-for-like sales excluding fuel but including VAT were up 2.1 per cent, helped by a strong final quarter. Chief executive Justin King said: “We are succeeding by understanding what our customers want, supporting and inspiring them to Live Well For Less. 'Brand Match, combined with our use of coupons at the till, has improved Sainsbury’s price perception whilst retaining the benefits of our heritage in quality and service.'","Clintons is the UK's biggest card retailer and employs more than 8,000 staff .

"By . Claire Bloomfield . PUBLISHED: . 09:04 EST, 5 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:37 EST, 5 July 2012 . My miracle: Lisa with her son Liam, 3. Doctors said she would never be able to conceive naturally . A woman who was told she would never give birth naturally after going through the menopause three decades early has told how she defied doctors to have a baby boy. Lisa Burt had begun trying for a baby when she was 24, but within a year her hopes of a large family appeared cruelly dashed when she discovered her body had been undergoing the change since she was just 17. The healthcare assistant and her partner Dominic Lowe, who are both now 31, had gone to doctors after failing to conceive for a year. But they told her she would be unable to conceive naturally and she started a course of hormone replacement therapy. Lisa said: 'When I went for the tests I just thought that at worst my body was being a bit slow and they’d prescribe me fertility drugs to make it happen a bit quicker. 'When they told me I was going through the menopause I went into shock. I was sure they must have had my results mixed up with an older lady. How could I be going through the menopause, I was only 25? 'I looked over at my partner and saw tears in his eyes and realised what it meant – that we would never be able to have kids. I was utterly devastated.' Lisa had always dreamed of having a large family with her partner, who she met ten years ago. Confident that she would quickly get pregnant after coming off the pill when she was 24, Lisa allowed herself to start picking names. But after a year of trying she visited her GP. When he asked her about her cycle she told him her periods had always been irregular and he arranged blood tests. Days later the results were back and showed Lisa’s hormone levels were lower than expected. A little anxious, the couple thought it wouldn’t take much to sort out. But the truth was far worse. After hospital tests, their consultant broke the news that Lisa was one of a small percentage of women to start the menopause early. He estimated she may have been as young as 17 when it began. 'It was like our whole future had been ripped away. I was mourning for the life I thought I would have – full of kids. I felt like I was letting Dom down, too,' Lisa said. It was explained their only real hope lay in egg donation. Overjoyed: Dom with baby Liam. Lisa was five-months pregnant before the couple relalised . 'In sheer panic I sat my younger sister down and asked if she would consider donating her eggs,' Lisa said. 'I cried when she said she would and paid for us to see a private fertility expert. They . gave us lots of different scenarios to consider – for example, what . if she gave me some eggs and was then unable to fall pregnant? 'It made me realise it wasn’t something we could rush into. My sister was only 20 and I didn’t want to pressure her.' But as the weeks passed, depression set in. 'Everywhere I looked there seemed to be pregnant women and babies,' recalls Lisa. 'Dom was brilliant but it was tough.' Then in November 2007 she saw alternative therapist Reef Steele after a friend recommended him. Mr Steele explained that he would try to alter the way she thought about pregnancy in the hope her body would follow suit. He told her to visualise herself conceiving, being pregnant and finally giving birth. 'After the session I felt hugely relaxed,' Lisa said. 'I’d . really enjoyed it and left feeling positive for the first time in ages. I didn’t think I would get pregnant, but I felt better.' Lisa and Dom before she fell pregnant (left) and baby Liam (right) just after he was born . Then seven months later in July 2008 she and Dom went on holiday where she complained about feeling bloated. She said: 'I put it down to the side effects of the HRT. I also thought I might be constipated after rubbish on holiday.' But then the couple began wondering whether Lisa could be pregnant - and dashed to the supermarket to buy a test. 'I was shaking when the line turned blue,' said Lisa. When they returned home Lisa saw her GP. 'I lay down and he started examining me. Then he gave me the biggest smile and said  ""Congratulations"",' she said. Happy family: Lisa and Dom with Liam. They said they were still hopeful about having another child . He estimated she was already five months pregnant, and had conceived about two months after having alternative therapy. Lisa stopped taking HRT and just 16 weeks later in December 2008 gave birth to Liam. He is now a boisterous three-year-old. 'Holding him for the first time was the best moment of my life,' she said. After the birth, Lisa was put back on HRT and she says that if she and Dom decide to try for another baby she’ll be making an appointment with Reef. 'I don’t know what he did, but I felt instantly better and a few months later I was pregnant after being told it was impossible. However it happened, I’m so lucky it did,' she said.","Lisa was devastated when she was told she couldn't have children as she had dreamed of having a big family .

It's aimed at sharing short videos rapidly, and adding the same sort of 'hip' effects that have made Instagram a cult web hit . After Mark Zuckerberg's billion-dollar purchase of photo-sharing website Instagram, start-ups are vying to become 'Instagram for video'. Effects-heavy video-sharing app Viddy pulled into pole position this week as it became the top free app for iPhone this week. The service, which lets users share short videos is described as a 'Twitter' for video. It's aimed at sharing short videos rapidly, and adding the same sort of 'hip' effects that have made Instagram a cult web hit. 'Since launching its Timeline app in February, Viddy has seen over 15 million interactions with its content on Facebook, with over 1.7 million users signing on,' says TechCrunch, which reported on the success of the new start-up. 'Viddy also says that it’s averaging 300K new registered users per day, an average that has seen a significant bump since February.' 'Turn everyday moments into perfect little movies with Viddy on iPhone,' say the app's creators. 'So next time you catch that pristine sunset over the Pacific, make it more than a memory. Then share it with your Viddy community and upload them to Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.' Users can 'follow', 'like' and share videos as easily as via Instagram - and the service already has eight million users . The service, which lets users share short videos is described as a 'Twitter' for video . The app has seen a huge increase in traffic after launching a Facebook Timeline app which allowed users to showcase videos via their Timelines . A Facebook Timeline app has added to the service's popularity - allowing users to record their life in short video clips, much in the same way as ordinary 'Timelines' Clips recorded and shared via the service are limited to 15 seconds in length. 'If you’ve seen what Instagram has done for phone-shot photos, you can imagine that Viddy may soon do the same for videos,' the New York Times said in a review of the app . As with Instagram, the app includes effects such as vintage film styles, retro-style camera hues and advanced effect such as transitions and music tracks. Viddy also allows users to share videos instantly via Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Tumblr. Videos can be shared publicly or with friends, and can be tagged and commented on, just as with posts on Facebook or Instagram. Celebrities such as Jamie Oliver use the app to share their images with fans . While Instagram is just one of many . photo-editing and photo-filter suites available for either platform, . users give it a top rating for the ease of applying filters and the very . simple way of sharing images via sites like Facebook and Twitter. Instanram also allows users to share images through its own sharing website, which has proved immensely popular with fans.","'Twitter' for video allows users to share short videos .

Colour confusion: Furniture designer Phillip Koomen, who is colour-blind, mistook red for amber, as he approached a level crossing in Henley-on-Thames . A colour-blind motorist failed to spot red flashing lights at a level crossing just moments before his car was pushed 30ft along a track  by an oncoming train. The Peugeot car belonging to 59-year-old furniture designer Philip Koomen was crushed and dragged along as the driver of the First Great Western train slammed on the brakes. He broke his arm in the drama. Koomen said that he had not seen the warning lights as he drove up to the unmanned crossing, which had no barriers and which London Mayor Boris Johnson had highlighted as a safety concern as far back as 2006, when he was MP for the local area. The shaken driver was hauled from the mangled wreckage after firefighters cut off the car’s roof, driver’s door and boot to allow rescuers to clamber inside. He was lucky to escape the horror collision with just a fractured arm and none of the 20 passengers on board the train were harmed. On Thursday he admitted a charge of dangerous driving following the collision close to Shiplake railway station on the outskirts of Henley-on-Thames, South Oxfordshire. The collision happened just hours after British Transport Police officers had been standing, giving safety advice to motorists as they negotiated the same crossing. The man’s car was hit by the 18:17 Henley to Twyford service, which was travelling at about 20mph at the time of the impact. 'As he approached the level crossing the light to indicate the train was approaching was on. However Dr Koomen failed to stop and after 37 seconds of the lights flashing he had crossed the level crossing,' said Julian Lynch, prosecuting. 'At the same moment, the train was approaching from Henley-on-Thames and struck Dr Koomen’s vehicle, pulling it ten metres down the track and causing damage to the car, to the train and injuring Dr Koomen.' Crushed: Phillip Koomen's Peugeot was dragged 30ft along the track when it was hit by a slow-moving train at the level crossing . Wreckage: Firefighters work to rescue Mr Koomen following the crash on November 17 last year . It . was estimated that the crash had caused more than £80,000 pounds worth . of damage and brought that stretch of the rail network to a standstill. Some . 16 trains were cancelled, four were partly cancelled and more trains . were delayed with the track having to be closed for 11 hours while . repair work could take place. Bystanders . said they had seen the lights flashing at the crossing as Dr Koomen’s . car approached, and thought that the Peugeot 307 would stop, only to . hear a loud bang as the train hit the moving vehicle. Train . driver Paul Conduit said he had slowed the train down from 50mph as he . approached Shiplake station, but had not seen Koomen’s car as it had . been in his blind spot. 'As I was going over the crossing I heard a big bang,' he said in a statement. Lucky escape: The driver only suffered a broken arm and no passengers were injured after the train ploughed into Phillip Koomen's car . 'I immediately put on my brakes. I looked out of the window and saw a silver estate car dragged ten to 15 metres.' In . his police interview Koomen, who has a PhD in design, said he had known . there was a level crossing in the area and had been expecting to see . signage to warn him of the hazard ahead. He . had slowed down to less than 15mph in preparation, and although he had . seen a single 'pulsating' light, he did not think this was the warning . light on the crossing. Magistrates sitting in Oxford . heard that he was colour bind and had difficulty differentiating between . red and amber coloured lights. 'I’m . looking for evidence of another light to tell me it’s a warning sign . and I continued thinking ""‘this isn’t a crossroad - it must be further . down,"" he told police in his statement. 'I . knew it was about 100 metres to the crossroad. I didn’t know exactly . where the crossroad was positioned, I’m looking for evidence that the . crossroad is nearby. 'I’m aware there is no barrier. The next moment there is a crash and I have no awareness I have crossed into a train.'David . Bright, defending, told the court that safety concerns had been raised . about the crossing as there had been several near misses in the past . decade. He said that in . October 2006 Boris Johnson, then MP for Henley, had raised a question . in Parliament calling for it to be made safer. Safety concerns: London Mayor Boris Johnson had highlighted the unmanned crossing, which had no barriers, in 2006, when he was MP for Henley . As well as a lack of safety barriers, Mr Bright said the lights could be obscured by foliage and had been tilted away from oncoming traffic - making them difficult for Koomen to identify in the dark. 'This clearly does not provide a problem for local residents, but for a stranger approaching the crossing from the side Dr Koomen was approaching is hazardous,' he said. He added: 'An angled light appeared to be a pulsating light. 'He was mistaken. As the court will know, the law is clear: making a mistake is not a defence and he has pleaded guilty.' Mr Bright said that since Koomen’s crash on November 17, last year, safety barriers had been installed at the crossing. Presiding magistrate Claire McGlashan said that grey-haried Koomen, of Abingdon in Oxfordshire, had been lucky not to have been killed in the crash. 'You caused major disruption to passenger services for about 12 hours and extensive damage,' she said to bespectacled Koomen, who stood solemnly in the dock, smartly dressed in a shirt and tie. 'However, no-one else was injured and your action was not deliberate.' She told Koomen that he would have to pay a £1,500 pounds fine, as well as £775 pounds in court costs and a £15 pounds victim surcharge within the next week. He was also banned from driving for a year and told that he would have to sit an extended test before being allowed a new licence.","Driver Phillip Koomen, 59, mistook red light for amber as he approached level crossing .

In the days before the Olympic podium it was the title belt given to the Usain Bolt of the late 19th century. The Grand Challenge Belt awarded in 1886 was actually silver rather than the now traditional gold -  but it was given to the fastest man in the world over 120 yards. The grand belt, complete with a Union Jack flag and detailed inscriptions, was handed to the winner of the 120 yard sprint at the event which took place a decade before the first modern day Olympiad in 1896. The belt of champions: The Grand Challenge Belt of Australasia was awarded to the winner of the 1886 120-yard sprint . The 120 yard sprint was a version of the modern day 100m race in the days before the Olympics were held. The historic belt is now set to fetched tens of thousands of pounds when it goes under the hammer next month. The Grand Challenge Belt of Australasia, made from silver, was won by W. Clarke on November 13 1886 and now belongs to Malcolm Clarke Baden, 71, after being passed down through generations of the family. The belt was awarded to crown the world's fastest men a decade before the first modern day Olympiad . Malcolm, from Burton-on-Trent, Staffs, said: 'A family member emigrated to Australia many, many years ago and the belt was won by one of my relatives in 1886. 'It belt was eventually bought back to the UK by one of my uncles and it has always been in our family ever since. 'A little bit of history has been lost along the way and there seems to be no real way to find out more about it only that it was won before the Olympics as we know them began. 'The actual race was the equivalent of the 100m today - but I doubt they were quite as fast as Usain Bolt. 'It was left to me by my father and I have had it for around 15 years now, so it’s about time for a collector who can really find out more about it to look after it. 'I took it to a television auction show when it came to town a few years ago who said it was worth £10,000 but to a collector it could be £100,000 - there is a lot of history here. 'I’m sure some Australians would love to get their hands on some extra silverware after finishing so far behind us at the Olympics.' The Grand Challenge Belt of Australasia is being sold as part of a three day fine art and antique sale from 19-21 September at Bamfords Auction in Derby. Bamfords Auctioneer Steven Iredale said: 'It’s difficult to understand why so little has been recorded about such a big event like this. 'We’ve been unable to uncover much information at all which is unusual for something that has such fantastic collectors value attached to it. Valuable: Experts say the 120-year-old belt could be worth tens of thousands of pounds when it goes under the hammer next month . 'The race was basically what is now known as the 100m race at the modern Olympics. 'These athletic meetings preceded what we now call the Olympics, this event taking place 10 years before the first games but there could have been many more before. 'We expect the belt to be snapped up for somewhere between at least £6,000 to £10,000 but it could be much more. 'It’s something very rare which will hardly ever come up at auction again so would mean a great deal to many collectors around the world.'","Title was given to sprint champions instead of medals in days before Olympics .

Conman: Unscrupulous Peter Wall, 30, spun Rebecca Kew 'a web of lies' about his past in order to get her to buy things for him, a court heard . A conman who met a woman on a dating website spun an extraordinary web of lies to impress her. Peter Wall, 30, claimed to be an Army captain who had won the Military Cross in Afghanistan. He told 25-year-old Rebecca Kew that he helped police track down dangerous gunmen Raoul Moat and Derrick Bird. And that was only the start of his deception, Bradford Crown Court was told. He boasted that he had been given a job catching and cooking wild animals on a  television programme hosted by Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall. He said his mother lived in Australia, his father was dead and he had a twin sister who had died in car crash near her 21st birthday. He told her that he saved his family from a house fire at the age of eight, that he was a former professional rugby player with a first-class degree from Loughborough, that he had been fast-tracked through the Army after Sandhurst and that his brother was head chef at a Marcus Wareing restaurant. He also said he had been head hunted by MI5 and M16, his stepfather was a gangster and his best friend had committed suicide. In fact, he was a former logistics engineer in the Army who was discharged on medical grounds in 2006 without having risen from the rank of private. His mother was in Liverpool. The court heard that a month after making contact over the internet, Wall, from Blackburn, texted Miss Kew to say he had been hit by a car and was in hospital. Lies: Wall told Miss Kew he had helped hunt down gunmen Raoul Moat, left, and Derrick Bird, right . 'Web of lies': Wall told Miss Kew that he had been awarded the military cross, left, for his work in Afghanistan and got a job on a television programme hosted by Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, right . He claimed he had nowhere to go. Having given him several hundreds of pounds for hotels, Miss Kew introduced him to her parents and he soon moved in to their home in Todmorden, West Yorkshire. Wall told the Kews he wanted to do a charity walk for Help for Heroes, so charity boxes were placed in their fish-and-chip shop. As well as professing his love for her, Wall told Miss Kew he was earning £4,000 a month but she became suspicious when he kept asking her to pay for things. In July 2011 he arrived at her home in an Audi, which the court heard was owned by another woman he was seeing, before packing his bags and leaving. At that point Miss Kew, who lost almost £3,000, researched him on the internet and found he had a string of previous convictions. When she texted him asking what was going on, he replied: ‘You weren’t supposed to get hurt. Take care.’ Wall admitted three charges of fraud by false representation. Jailing him for a year, Judge John Potter said: ‘This was a determined and devious course of offending.’","Peter Wall spun Rebecca Kew a 'web of lies' about his past .

Summer holidays are turning into a costly experience for cash-strapped Britons, thanks to a host of 'rip-off' charges once they arrive at their destination. People feel they are being overcharged on everything from using their mobile phones, to using cash machines and even hiring sun-loungers, according to a survey. When asked if data roaming charges were too high on their mobile phones, 60 per cent named this as one of the top five rip-offs people are landed with when on holiday. When in roam: People have complained about the high cost of using their mobile phones abroad . This is despite the European Parliament voting through a cap on mobile phone charges. From last month, the cost of making a mobile call from another European . Union country fell from 30p a minute to 24p, while a text dropped to . just 7p from 10p. Mobile firms also had to cap internet charges for the first time, at 58p per megabyte for customers on 'data roaming'. More than a quarter felt they were over-charged for hiring sun-loungers at beaches or around hotel pools, while 28 per cent said hotel wi-fi access was too costly, according to the YouGov survey of 2,000 people. A third thought the price of food and drink around major tourists hotspots was too expensive, as was the price of entrance tickets to attractions. Forty per cent also complained about the high charges for using debit or credit cards overseas, as well as fees for using foreign cash machines. Counting the cost: People cited the high charges for using credit and debit cards abroad as a top holiday gripe . These hidden charges can add more than five per cent to the total cost of goods being bought or amount of cash being withdrawn. A fifth of people complained that buying UK-branded goods, such as food or newspapers, costs too much in foreign countries. James Hickman, managing director of foreign exchange company Caxton FX, which commissioned the research from YouGov, said: 'It is clear that the nation feels there are a host of rip-offs to be aware of when holidaying abroad.' Referring to cash machines, Mr Hickman added: 'It is always best to avoid the trap of charges . and make it a habit to pay in the local currency while abroad. 'Too many . Brits end up shelling out for extra charges because they are too . embarrassed to take out their calculator and work out the difference.' YouGov asked people to list their top five holiday rip-offs as part of the survey. Although Britons had a long list of things that they felt were too expensive, the research also found that people do not spend wisely when on holiday. Four in ten travelers do not save spending money for their holidays prior to leaving the UK, while a fifth admit to going over budget when away from home. Mobile phone roaming charges    63% .

When The Only Way Is Essex's Tom Kilbey started dating Lydia Bright, it was clear he was never going to be best pals with her ex-boyfriend James 'Arg' Argent. But relations between the pair reached breaking point earlier tonight when Arg told Tom his sister Cara had claimed his relationship with the blonde fashionista wouldn't stand the test of time. Although the duo initially seemed to have put their differences to one side as they attended a musical showcase by TOWIE co-star Jess Wright, Tom later confronted Arg about his claims. Fuming: Tom Kilbey flew into a rage when Arg made comments about his sister Cara . Blood is thicker than water: Tom was angry that Arg had insinuated Cara doubted his relationship with Lydia . He said: 'I've spoken to Cara, she says she didn't say that. Blood is thicker than water, so obviously I side with her.' As Arg - who is now dating Gemma Collins - stood by his claims, it wasn't long before the argument reached breaking point. Shouting at his former pal outside the venue, Tom said in a foul-mouthed tirade: 'You're a f***ing mug and you're chatting s**t about my sister. Pipe the f**k down and stop chatting s**t about my family. Friends: It initially seemed as though the boys had put their differences behind them . A calming influence: But the night ended with Lydia having to steer her boyfriend away from the fight . 'You're trying to make her sound like a b***h and you're lying. You're a doughnut, mate.' Although Tom was eventually dragged away from the argument by Lydia and her best pal, Danni Parks-Dempsey, that certainly wasn't it for fight night. Mark Wright's triumphant, albeit brief, return to the show for sister Jess's performance was eclipsed by a whole host of other feuds coming to a climax. He's back! 'King of Essex' Mark Wright made his return to TOWIE to see his sister Jess perform a showcase of songs . It was somewhat of a deja vu for Gemma Collins, who got into an angry shouting match with ex-boyfriend Charlie King and their mutual pal Bobby Cole Norris at the gig. After Bobby confessed his love for Charlie last week, the sandwich shop owner was left fuming when he discovered the Gok Wan lookalike had discussed his feelings with Gemma, who had always suggested there was a hint of romance between the pair. A frustrated Charlie said: 'She's trying to dig up the past. I'm trying to get a girlfriend and obviously I can't because there's constant speculation that I'm gay.' But after confronting Gemma about her comments, it spiralled into a huge argument between the threesome. 'You should have spoken to me': Bobby was devastated when Charlie reprimanded him for discussing his feelings with Gemma . Gemma shouted: 'Go and talk to your little boyfriend about it. Bobby has been confiding in me and now you're both ganging up at me. 'You [Bobby] come to me in my flat and confide in me and insinuate that something touchy-feely happened in Marbella. You two are a pair of Jeckylls. Essex is so two-faced.' Elsewhere, the tension between former friends Lucy Mecklenburgh and Sam Faiers continued to bubble, with Sam claiming she had proof the brunette bombshell's fiance, Mario Falcone, had cheated on her with another girl. Angry: Gemma was absolutely fuming when ex-boyfriend Charlie accused her of spreading rumours about him . Argument: Bobby sided with his pal Charlie over Gemma . Lucy fumed to pals Lydia and Danni: 'If she had proof why when I went round to her house, why didn't she give me it then rather than start it all up again? What the f**k? 'The girl is a mutual friend of mine and Mario. She's investigating it to try and prove herself right.' The boutique owner also accused her blonde co-star of stabbing her in the back when over Christmas 2010 she slept with Mark Wright the same day Lucy had split up with him. Lucy added: 'This isn't the first time she's stabbed me in the back. I broke up with Mark Wright and she went home in a cab with him and s*****d him that night. 'She's stabbed me in the back': Lucy confided with Danni and Lydia about the cheating rumours . Trust me: Mario Falcone insisted he had nothing to hide from Lucy . 'That's not a friend. Perhaps I should have drawn a line under it years ago.' And finally Joey Essex went to confront new Essex playboy Jamie Reed after he recently bragged about sleeping with Joey's sister Frankie. He said: 'It's disrespectful. It's upset me, it's upset my family. People have got the hump with you.' After Jamie offered to send Frankie a £50 bouquet of flowers, Joey flew off the handle - insisting only a face to face apology would do, and baffling Jamie with his Essex lingo in the meantime. He fumed: 'I want you to say sorry to her face, she don't want flowers from you. I think you're a bit of a mug. A proper lunchbox, I think you are. Ta-ta.'

A private space cargo firm's historic launch to the International Space Station descended into chaos this morning when the mission was abandoned just one second before lift-off. The unmanned SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket was set to blast off from Cape Canaveral just before 10am this morning (GMT) along with its Dragon capsule loaded with 1,000lbs of space station provisions. But with just seconds before the rocket took to the skies, apparent technical problems left it rooted to the launch pad, with lift-off subsequently abandoned for another three days. Abort: Live footage shows plumes shooting from the side of the Falcon 9, as its much anticipated launch was abandoned at the final second . Delayed: SpaceX's ambitious space trip will now be postponed until Tuesday following the technical error this morning . The countdown reached all the way to practically zero Saturday morning for the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. A NASA spokesman said the engine ignition sequence started, but there was an automatic shutdown by on-board computers. So instead of blasting off from Cape Canaveral on a delivery mission to the International Space Station, the rocket remained on its launch pad amid a cloud of engine exhaust. The engine ignition sequence had started up, but there was an automatic shutdown by on-board computers. So instead of blasting off on a delivery mission to the space station, the rocket stayed on its launch pad amid a cloud of engine exhaust. The unfortunate delay caught even NASA's most seasoned launch commentator off guard. '... 3-2-1, zero, and liftoff,' announced commentator George Diller, his voice trailing as the rocket failed to budge. 'We've had a cutoff. Liftoff did not occur.' Billionaire rocket designer Elon Musk attributed the problem to slightly high combustion chamber pressure on engine No. 5. 'Will adjust limits for countdown in a few days,' he wrote via Twitter. Tuesday is the earliest that SpaceX can try again to send its cargo-laden Dragon capsule to the space station. The California-based company - formally known as Space Exploration Technologies Corp. - is targeting every third day for a launch attempt to save fuel in case of rendezvous problems at the space station. Ready for launch: SpaceX's Falcon 9 sits on Pad 40 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station this morning as officials made final preparations for its launch . Standing tall: Falcon 9 and Dragon spacecraft, pictured a day before its launch, are in the final stages of preparation for their historic flight . Falcon 9's eventual launch will see it in the vicinity of the Space Station within two days, where it will complete practice manoeuvres before the docking takes place the next day. Amid the chaos of SpaceX's delayed Falcon launch, there was also disappointment for another secret mission the rocket was due to perform - sending James 'Scotty from Star Trek' Doohan and 307 other people's ashes into orbit. Having failed to launch the Star Trek acting legend's remains into orbit in August 2008 when Space X's Falcon 1 exploded after take-off, this is the second attempt to put a seven gram capsule of his ashes into space. But friends and relatives of Doohan, who died in 2005 aged 85, who gathered at Cape Canaveral will have to wait until Tuesday for the next attempt after Falcon 9 stalled on lift-off. Paying a minimum of $2,995 to Celestis, Doohan and 307 other people's capsules will be launched from the Falcon 9 rocket nine minutes into the flight. Once there Doohans capsule will begin a decaying orbit of the Earth that will last between 10 to 240 years, 'until it reenters the atmosphere, harmlessly vapourising like a shooting star.' Only governments have completed such a feat to date, with the SpaceX voyage the first time such a voyage has been completed by a private firm. Ferrying the Dragon capsule into space, the mission to the ISS will be to deliver 1,000 pounds of non-essential cargo after passing a series of test maneuvers over the course of three days. If successful in its first-of-a kind mission, the company behind the venture SpaceX would collect the remaining payments on the $396 million contract it has with NASA and then enter into a $1.6 billion agreement for 11 more flights to the ISS. The first step in the commercialisation of space to non-governmental firms, SpaceX are hoping one day to deliver up to seven passengers to the ISS and other destinations in low-Earth orbit. The Falcon 9 rocket suffers from an 'instantaneous launch window' which means that if they don't take off at the exact scheduled moment they will have to wait till 3.44 a.m on Tuesday for the pad and the ISS to line up again. This will be the Falcon's third flight as SpaceX have already sent the projectile into space on two previous occasions. However, this mission from a private contractor is not without risk and could very well end in failure, something which SpaceX have been upfront and honest about. 'Demonstration launches are conducted to determine potential issues so that they might be addressed and – by their very nature – carry a significant risk,' said a statement by the private space firm according to the Guardian. 'All spaceflight is incredibly complicated, and this flight introduces a series of new challenges – it is only the third flight of the Falcon 9 rocket, the second of the Dragon capsule, and the first for a number of all-new components necessary to berth with the International Space Station. 'If any aspect of the mission is not successful, SpaceX will learn from the experience and try again.' If all goes well though on the next launch, Falcon 9 will carry the Dragon capsule into space and match orbits with the ISS.

The full flight-ready Falcon 9  (left and right) with Dragon capsule onboard stands on the launch pad at SLC-40, Cape Canaveral, Florida . There it will go through a series of tests and will pass around one and a half miles below the station to see if its controls are testing properly. If that checks out OK, the ISS will allow the Dragon capsule to within 10 feet and pull it in for docking all the while traveling at 17,500 mph. Staying on board the space station for a week and a half, it will then be re-loaded and sent back to Earth where it will land in the Pacific and be retrieved. The launch and subsequent mission will be nerve racking for SpaceX and Elon Musk, the PayPal entrepreneur who founded the space exploration firm. An artists view of the space station's robotic arm reaching out to grab SpaceX's Dragon capsule which will happen if all goes according to plan after this Saturday's launch . 'We have to allow for the fact that this is an extremely complex and tough flight. It's a test flight, not a standard milk run,' said Alan Stern, a U.S aerospace consultant and former associate administrator in charge of science at Nasa according to the New York Times. 'Elon Musk and SpaceX have a tremendous track record, and when Falcon 1 failed, they stuck with it and made it work. 'They will have a failure again, because everyone does, but a test flight is a learning experience. SpaceX tested the Dragon capsules ability to parachute safely (left) and to splash down in the Pacific (right) 'Regardless of how successful the flight is, whether it's complete or partial, it's a big step forward. This is a sea change.' Originally, the plan was for SpaceX and their capsule to have docked with the ISS by 2009. 'Certainly, we would have hoped to have been further ahead,' said Elon Musk, founder of SpaceX  to the New York Times. 'But I wouldn’t have expected that with great confidence.'","Launch delayed after 'computer problems' on board commercial rocket .

Andrew and Maria Louden, of Plymouth, Devon, failed to feed Tottie and another retired greyhound called Pebbles or treat Tottie's painful sores, Plymouth magistrates heard. But the couple, who both admitted two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to their dogs Tottie and Pebbles, were spared jail because of their poor health. Cruel: Andrew, 48, and Maria Louden, 49, almost starved their two pets to death while leaving them flea-ridden and covered in painful sores . Sorry state: Former racing greyhound champion, Bubbly Tottie, was found . emaciated, flea-ridden and covered in sores after being neglected by his owners . Presiding magistrate Dennis Gavin told the court the dogs were left 'malnourished, underweight and flea-ridden'. He added: 'Had it not been for your medical conditions, you would be going to prison today.' The pair were each sentenced to eight weeks in prison, suspended for 12 months. They must both stick to a curfew at home between 7pm and 7am every night for four months. Each must pay £200 in costs to the RSPCA. RSPCA Inspector Sarah Morris, speaking after the case, said it was the worst case of dog cruelty she had seen in 12 years. She added: 'A life ban from keeping animals is a brilliant result. The dogs were in such a terrible, tragic state. This case will stay with me.' Julian Jefferson, representing the Loudens, had said both his clients were disabled and on benefits and had found it hard to feed the dogs adequately because their payments had been 'suddenly seized'. Magistrates heard that both dogs were 'about to die' when Andrew, 48, and Maria, 49, finally took them for treatment. Neglect: An RSPCA inspector said the treatment Tottie and another greyhound, Pebbles suffered was the worst she had seen in 12 years . Andrew Wyatt, prosecuting for the RSPCA, said the couple took Tottie to a PDSA animal hospital on October 4 last year. Staff said the dog was emaciated, flea-ridden and had sores on its hind quarters. Pebbles was also examined by a vet and found to be in a similarly poor state and close to death. Mr . Wyatt said Tottie, known as ‘Bubbly Tottie’, had previously won the . greyhound St Leger, a famous competition at Wimbledon Stadium, and once . changed hands for £50,000. The Loudens both admitted two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to the dogs. They today . pleaded guilty at Plymouth Magistrates' Court to failing to adequately feed the pets and get . veterinary attention for Tottie’s sores between September 20 and October . 4 last year. They also admitted to failing to protect both dogs from pain and suffering in not treating their flea infestations. Both greyhounds have since made full recoveries and have been happily re-homed.

A thick layer of dust blanketed Baghdad today as one of the heaviest sandstorms in years hit the city a day before it is due to host global talks with Iran about nuclear weapons. The sky turned an ominous orange as sand from the surrounding desert blew into the Iraqi capital and caused mayhem. The international airport was closed, businesses were forced to shut and hundreds of residents – particularly those with asthma - went to hospital with breathing difficulties due to the choking air. Hazy summer days: An Iraqi man stands in a Baghdad street, in an orange haze from a heavy dust storm a day before talks with Iran begin there . The spring storm also appeared to hamper military flights. None of the helicopter patrols that regularly roar over the city of six million people seemed to be airborne. Sandstorms usually occur about twice a year in Baghdad, which is shielded from the desert by a thin strip of arable land between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. But this latest one comes as a very unfortunate time as Iran and six world powers are due to meet in the city tomorrow for negotiations over Iran's nuclear intentions. The storm means envoys may struggle to reach the Iraqi capital. Hidden: A man rides his donkey cart while everything else on the street is masked by the sandstorm . Glowing: Traffic snakes through Kahramana Square during the heavy sandstorm, which prompted the shutdown of Baghdad's airport . Masked: A traffic policeman directs vehicles while the thick, choking air makes it both hard to see and breathe . Disruption: Traffic slowly moves down a street a s man signals for a taxi to stop in a bid to escape the choking sandstorm . The U.S., Britain, Russia, China, France and Germany hope the talks will result in an agreement by Tehran to stop enriching uranium to a higher level that could be turned quickly into the fissile core of nuclear arms. Failure will strengthen calls for military action following the almost decade-long effort to persuade Iran to stop its programme. But hours before the talks are due to begin, the United Nations nuclear chief today said a tentative deal has been reached with the Islamic republic. Tehran will allow the UN nuclear agency to restart a long-stalled probe into suspicions that Tehran has secretly worked on developing nuclear arms. By compromising on the International Atomic Energy Agency probe, Iranian negotiators in Baghdad could argue that the onus is on the other side to show some flexibility and temper its demands. Caked: An Iraqi woman is barely discernible as she walks in a Baghdad street clogged with orange dust . Struggle: An Iraqi policeman wears a protective surgical mask as he mans a checkpoint . Hardgoing: Residents wear masks as they walk near Tahrir Square in central Baghdad. Many business were closed due to the conditions . Contrasting fortunes: A woman with breathing difficulty uses an oxygen mask in hospital, left, while a boy makes some extra money selling masks in central Baghdad . Although IAEA chief Yukiya Amano Amano's trip and the talks in Baghdad are formally separate, Iran hopes progress can boost its chances in pressing the U.S. and Europe to roll back sanctions that have hit Iran's critical oil exports and blacklisted the country from international banking networks. It is unclear how far the results achieved by Mr Amano would serve that purpose, with his trip failing to seal a conclusive deal, despite his upbeat comments. After talks in Tehran with chief Iranian nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili, Mr Amano said: ‘The decision was made ... to reach agreement on the mechanics of giving the IAEA access to sites, scientists and documents it seeks to restart its probe.’ Mr Amano speaking to reporters on his return to Vienna airport after his one-day trip to Tehran, said differences existed on ‘some details’, without elaborating, but added that Mr Jalili had assured him that these ‘will not be an obstacle to reach agreement’. He spoke of ‘an almost clean text’ that will be signed soon, although he could not say when. Cllogged: Men wear dust masks as they walk through one of Baghdad's main commercial districts . Keep on moving: Iraqis walk through Tahrir Square during a heavy sandstorm . For the six powers, a main concern is Iran's production of uranium enriched to 20 per cent, which is far higher than needed for regular energy-producing reactors but used for one Iran says it needs for medical research. The U.S. and its allies fear the higher-enriched uranium could be quickly boosted to warhead-grade material. American officials have said Washington will not backpedal from its stance that Iran must fully halt uranium enrichment. But speculation is increasing that the priorities have shifted to block the 20 per cent enrichment and perhaps allow Iran to maintain lower-level nuclear fuel production - at least for now.","Storm forces airport to shut, hindering travel for envoys from Iran and six other nations due to meet in city tomorrow .

He owns a £7million home, earns £1.2million a year running a bank bailed out by the taxpayer and reluctantly bowed to pressure and declined a £963,000 bonus. But Royal Bank of Scotland boss Stephen Hester says ‘life is not about money’. Mr Hester told pupils at a South London school that life ‘is about doing things that make you feel valuable, not necessarily measured by money’. Controversial: Stephen Hester, 51, who hates this picture being used, has been criticised for his fat-cat pay . But he added: ‘Like it or not, money is one of the things that motivates people.’ Mr Hester, 51, has become a lightning rod for anger over fat-cat pay, attracting criticism for his lavish lifestyle despite presiding over a bank that was bailed out with £45.5billion of taxpayers’ money. Last month he invited the public to see the manicured 350-acre gardens of his £7million home, just outside Banbury in Oxfordshire. In January, after weeks of holding out, the controversial bank boss waived his bonus for last year after intense media and political pressure. Asked by a pupil at Dunraven School in Streatham whether he declined his bonus because he thought it was immoral, Mr Hester replied: ‘I want to be paid well – I have no hesitation about saying that. ‘There’s no morality involved and it allows me to pay a large amount of tax for other things to be done.’ Mr Hester branded criticism of his pay ‘unfair’ and said he ‘came within inches of quitting’ during the row over his bonus. Anger: A string of companies, including Barclays, insurance giant Aviva, . publishing group Trinity Mirror and Britain's biggest car dealer . Pendragon, have faced rebellions from shareholders over boardroom greed . He added: ‘We are in a time of high emotion, people looking for things to blame. ‘If you have a high-profile job as I have, at times you get caught in the swirls of politics. ‘It was a tsunami at the time, I think it caught me unfairly, but nevertheless I’m a volunteer in this job; you have to deal with what it throws you.’ A string of companies, including Barclays, insurance giant Aviva, publishing group Trinity Mirror and Britain’s biggest car dealer Pendragon, have faced rebellions from shareholders over boardroom greed. Liberal Democrat peer Lord Oakeshott says RBS should lend small businesses money so they can employ young people . RBS, which is 82 per cent owned by taxpayers and plunged to a £2billion loss last year, will face its shareholders at its annual meeting later this month. Asked whether the reputation of bankers could be restored, Mr Hester said: ‘People have hated money lenders for thousands of years.’ The RBS chief’s unapologetic words resulted in a fresh salvo from his critics. Liberal Democrat peer Lord Oakeshott said: ‘What would make small businesses feel  valuable is if RBS could lend them the money so they can employ young people.’ High Pay Centre chairman Deborah Hargreaves said: ‘It’s a bit rich of Hester to say this when he employs eight gardeners to keep his 350-acre landscaped garden. ‘He should remember he is talking to people who won’t earn in a lifetime what he earns in a year. He makes a strong case for cutting pay across the board.’","Stephen Hester is target for anger over fat-cat pay .

Britain was locked in a farcical diplomatic stand-off with Ecuador last night after the South American country granted asylum to WikiLeaks fugitive Julian Assange. Assange, who is wanted in Sweden for questioning over sexual assault allegations, has spent nearly two months hiding from the law in the Ecuadorian embassy. Yesterday more than 40 policemen surrounded the building in central London to ensure the Australian could not be smuggled out. A further six officers were stationed in the communal areas of the building, guarding lifts and access to the roof, as part of an operation that will cost at least £50,000 a day. The moment Mr Assange sets foot outside the confines of the embassy, which is just yards from Harrods, the 41-year-old will be arrested. Police will be equipped with heat detection equipment to beat any attempt to use special diplomatic bags or furniture to aid his escape. Scores of his supporters added to the circus atmosphere chanting ‘hands off Ecuador’ and ‘Julian Assange freedom fighter’. Many of them wore masks associated with the Anonymous hacking group that has attacked government websites. There was applause as the Ecuadorian foreign minister, Ricardo Patiño, declared that Assange had been given ‘diplomatic asylum’ at a press conference in the capital, Quito. Scroll down to hear from William Hague . A supporter of the WikiLeaks founder is tackled by police in London yesterday . Supporters of Julian Assange, who faces extradition to Sweden, gather outside the Ecuador embassy in Knightsbridge yesterday . ‘We believe that his fears are legitimate and there are the threats that he could face political persecution. 'We trust that that the UK will offer as soon as possible the guarantee for the safe passage of asylum for Mr Assange and they will respect those international agreements they have signed in the past.’ Yesterday, less than 24 hours after threatening to rescind the building’s diplomatic protections and forcibly enter it, the Foreign Office was forced into a humiliating climbdown. It accepted the need for a ‘a negotiated solution’ to the deadlock and was reduced to insisting that Mr Assange would be arrested if he tried to leave.

A supporter of Julian Assange is removed by police outside the Ecuador embassy as the crowd grew. It is not known whether he was arrested . If an agreement is not reached and he . cannot escape, he could be forced to spend months or even years in legal . limbo inside the embassy building, where he has until recently been . forced to sleep on a blow-up bed. Ministers’ only option appears to be to encourage other countries to put pressure on Ecuador to agree a deal. The row over Mr Assange’s future erupted on Wednesday night when Ecuador’s foreign minister went public with a note from the British charge d’affairs threatening to use an obscure law to rescind the building’s diplomatic status, storm the building and make the arrest. British officials said it was an attempt to ‘rattle their cage’ but Mr Patino reacted with fury, claiming such a move would be seen as a ‘hostile act’. Announcing the decision to award ‘diplomatic asylum’ in a televised statement yesterday, he said Mr Assange was a victim of political persecution and could face the death penalty if sent to the US by Sweden. Mr Assange’s supporters fear he could face charges of sedition and espionage over the release of tens of thousands of secret US documents by the WikiLeaks site two years ago. Mr Patino said: ‘It is not impossible that he would be treated in a cruel manner, condemned to life in prison, or even the death penalty.’ The decision was condemned by Foreign Secretary William Hague who said asylum was being used ‘for the purposes of escaping the regular processes of the court.’ He added: ‘No one, least of all the government of Ecuador, should be in any doubt that we are determined to carry out our legal obligation to see Mr Assange extradited to Sweden. ‘This is not about Mr Assange’s activities at WikiLeaks or the attitude of the United States of America. 'He is wanted in Sweden to answer allegations of serious sexual offences.’ Both the Prime Minister and Nick Clegg’s private offices spoke yesterday morning to William Hague’s office urging that the rhetoric be toned down. ‘The message was “calm the heck down”,’ a senior Whitehall source said. Mr Hague admitted he had authorised the communications with Ecuador, including the reference to the 1987 Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act which allow the suspension of normal embassy rules. The law was a response to the shooting dead of WPC Yvonne Fletcher from inside the Libyan embassy in 1984. Last night senior diplomats privately condemned the Ecuadorian government which they said had been captured by left-wingers similar to Venezuelan firebrand Hugo Chavez – who regard Mr Assange as a hero because they hate the United States. ‘There is evidence that he did not turn up there by accident,’ a senior source said. Mr Assange welcomed the decision to grant him asylum as a ‘significant victory’ made by a ‘courageous, independent Latin American nation’.

Sunday – in what would be a further humiliation for ministers. His lawyer, Geoffrey Robertson QC, . claimed the blunder over the threatening letter happened because ‘all . the good lawyers’ at the Foreign Office were away on holiday. Human rights activists poured scorn on Ecuador’s claim to be protecting human rights. The regime has a notorious record for persecuting both journalists and its political opponents. Mr Assange entered the embassy on June 19, after a two-year legal battle against extradition under the European Arrest Warrant. His . case against extradition was rejected by a district court, at the High . Court and went all the way to the Supreme Court where it also failed. He . was granted bail after sureties worth nearly £250,000 were pledged by . his supporters, who include film director Ken Loach, socialite Jemima . Khan and journalist John Pilger.

The 41-year-old slept on an inflatable mattress for much of his stay but now has a permanent bed. His room also contains a treadmill, a computer and a sunlamp sent to him by his mother.

"By . Chris Greenwood . UPDATED: . 20:30 EST, 16 October 2011 . Celebrities and millionaires living on one of Britain’s most exclusive estates have become the targets of a crime wave. A diplomat’s wife and son became the latest victims after they were tied up and held at gunpoint during a £100,000 robbery. St George’s Hill in Surrey has been dubbed the British ‘Beverly Hills’ and is home to Russian oil tycoons, hedge fund managers and City financiers. Exclusive: The St George's Hill estate in Surrey has been hit by a crime wave in recent months. It lists oil tycoons and hedge fund managers among its residents . Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty and Chelsea footballer Didier Drogba are also residents. The estate is hidden behind security gates and guarded around the clock by security guards and CCTV cameras. But that has failed to protect the residents from falling foul of a string of crimes since April. Police have warned them to be on their guard after the latest incident last month was a gunpoint £100,000 robbery in which a diplomat’s wife and son were tied up. One resident said homeowners, who paid up to £10million for the privilege, are ‘living in fear’ of becoming the next victim. The neighbourhood, a favourite with Russian oil tycoons, hedge fund traders and City financiers, has been dubbed the British ‘Beverley Hills’. Among the high-profile names to own a home there are Dragons’ Den star Theo Paphitis, Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty and Chelsea footballer Didier Drogba. Other include Scottish TV actress Hannah Gordon, former Chelsea player Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and the BSkyB chief executive Jeremy Darroch. While former residents on the 420-home estate include Ringo Starr, Kate Winslet, Cliff Richard, Jenson Button and Sir Elton John. Surrey Police admitted the tranquil Weybridge neighbourhood, known as ‘The Hill’ to locals, has been hit by a string of crimes since April. Celebrity residents: Bollywood star Shilpa Shetty and Chelsea striker Didier Drogba are among the people who live in St George's Hill, Surrey . They included two violent robberies, a burglary, two thefts, the theft of a car, vandalism and a violent attack. Detectives are still hunting the masked gunman behind the terrifying robbery where the victims were tied up and threatened with a sawn-off shotgun. The woman, aged in her 30s, and her teenage son escaped unhurt as he made off with cash and jewellery worth £100,000. Police suspect their attacker may have had an accomplice in a car outside but the pair managed to dodge security on the estate. One local, who did not want to be named, said all householders had been warned about the recent crimes and been told to ‘be vigilant’. He said: ‘There has been a lot of talk about the crime rate in the past six months. ‘Although it might not seem particularly high compared to most of the country, the simple fact is that people pay a lot of money to live here and do not expect to be living in fear. ‘There are private security guards, CCTV cameras, barriers and all sorts, so this kind of thing is very out of the ordinary for people who live here. ‘We have been told to be vigilant and to report any suspicious behaviour to the police and to the security team here.’ Elmbridge councillor Peter Harman said: ‘They’ve got their own security on the estate and they have cameras that monitor traffic going in and out, and all the cars are recorded, so it should be easy to trace people.’ The residents’ association boasts it is a ‘unique location’ for successful high achievers looking for a ‘secure and private location.’ Each house is required to have ‘at least’ one acre of land and boundaries cannot be marked by fences or walls, only hedges and bushes. The 964-acre estate boasts its own golf club and 15 tennis courts, four squash courts, state-of-the-art gym, 20m swimming pool and sauna, bar and restaurants and its own beauty spa. According to estate agents Savills, the the area is ‘internationally renowned as one of the most sought-after private estates in England.’ But it is not the first time the estate has had problems with unwanted intruders and people ignoring the law. In May, peace at the gated community was punctured when squatters moved into an empty property 200 yards from the members-only tennis club that forms its social hub. Residents were sent a letter saying those responsible were ‘known to police’ and they should be on their guard. But the unwelcome neighbours managed to stay for several weeks at the £3million empty property which was at the centre of a long-running legal dispute. A Surrey Police spokesman confirmed the crimes took and said officers continue to appeal for witnesses over the armed robbery. A spokesman for St George’s Hill Residents’ Association declined to comment.","Diplomat's wife and son tied up and held at gunpoint in £100,000 robbery .

A groom who caused more than £5million of damage after setting fire to a castle in a row over a bar bill was yesterday jailed for six years. Max Kay, 37, had drunk more than 20 double vodkas when he set a pair of curtains on fire with a cigarette lighter. He had earlier made threatening comments and told staff: ‘Nobody crosses Max.’ A judge said it was a ‘miracle’ that no one was killed in the blaze, which started directly under the bridal suite where Kay’s new wife was sleeping. Kay had spent almost £30,000 on a lavish reception at the country house hotel at Grade I-listed Peckforton Castle, near Tarporley, Cheshire, to give fiancée Stephanie the day of her dreams. Judge Roger Dutton told the property developer, who had previously been declared bankrupt, that he could not afford such extravagant nuptials but went ahead with them because his ‘ego’ dictated that he wanted to impress family and friends. ‘With a hotel full of your guests you quite deliberately set fire to it... putting the lives of your guests and the staff at the hotel and those brave firefighters who came to deal with it at risk,’ he said. ‘It was a miracle that nobody was either seriously hurt or killed by your action.’ Duncan Bould, prosecuting, told the court that Kay, a father of four, had been paying the bill in instalments prior to the wedding on June 18 last year. But each time one was due the hotel, which is owned by the Naylor family, struggled to get the money from him. Scroll down for video . Inferno: The fire started by Kay caused around £5.4 million damage to Peckforton Castle Hotel . Danger: After hearing Kay's threats, the hotel's . owners said they could not believe he would risk the lives of his own . friends and relatives, including his new bride Stephanie, right, by . attempting to burn down the castle . Revenge: Kay took 'revenge' while 'massively' drunk after bar staff refused him any more credit . Peckforton . Castle was built in the 1840s in the Gothic revival style complete with . portcullis, moat and arrow slots and stands on a prominent ridge of . hills in rural Cheshire near Tarporley. St . Pancras architect Sir George Gilbert Scott hailed it as ‘the largest . and most carefully and learnedly executed Gothic mansion of the . present’. The grade one . listed building has frequently been used for filming including episodes . of Dr Who and a 1991 production of Robin Hood featuring Uma Thurman. After . being converted into a hotel it was bought by current owners the Naylor . family in 2005 who spent £1.7million turning it into one of Cheshire’s . most sought-after wedding venues with packages costing £6,000 or more. The final instalment – of £15,000 – was paid just three days before the event, after the hotel threatened to cancel. The wedding went ahead but  by 10pm staff informed Kay that the £3,000 free bar was about to run out. He claimed to have paid another £2,000 up front, but staff, aware of the financial history, refused to give him more credit and an argument ensued. He started making threatening comments about the Naylor family, in particular Kate Naylor, the finance director, to other staff. ‘He described her to witnesses as a b****, he said that she was “going to get it”,’ Mr Bould said. ‘He was full of bravado, making threatening comments, saying “nobody crosses Max”.’ Chester Crown Court heard that Kay was . caught on CCTV going into a drawing room. Investigators later . discovered that the fire, which caused £5.4million of damage, had been . started in that room. A total of 117 people, including 13 . children and a disabled man using a wheelchair, had to be evacuated and . more than 100 firemen from four counties were scrambled to tackle the . blaze. Kay, of Halewood, Liverpool, who last . week became a father to premature twins, admitted arson that was . reckless as to whether life was endangered. His wife is standing by him. Lucky escape: Guests were forced to flee the inferno which Kay started while many were 'vulnerable' and asleep in their beds . Destruction: The blaze tore through the Grade I-listed building within minutes and required dozens of firefighters to bring it under control .

Stranded: Paul Kline and fellow diver Fernando Garcia Puerta were abandoned miles from land when their charter boat left without them . Two terrified divers were left stranded in shark-infested waters when their charter boat disappeared. Paul Kline and Fernando Garcia Puerta had to cling to a buoy for two hours after surfacing from their late-afternoon dive in the Atlantic Ocean three miles from Miami and finding no trace of their boat. 'We were in shock. We could easily have died,' Kline, 44, told the Miami Herald. 'If night had fallen, the situation would have turned into panic.' He said they kept talking to each other throughout their ordeal 'to try to keep up our high spirits'. Mr Kline, a married father of six from . Texas, told WSVN-TV that he could only think about getting back to his . family while stranded in the water. He said: 'I wasn't giving up anytime soon.' Mr Kline and Mr Puerta, a Spanish tourist, were eventually spotted by the crew of a passing yacht and brought safely to shore. 'You could notice a strong feeling of . relief,' said Elie Trichet, captain of the No Compromise which was . returning to Miami from the Florida Keys when his passengers saw the . men clutching their diving equipment. 'They had been clinging to that buoy for two hours hoping somebody would rescue them.' The rescued divers each paid $85 for . the four-hour adventure in Biscayne Bay, which was meant to include two . one-hour dives at different locations. Horror: The terrifying ordeal has been compared to the 2004 film Open Water . Mr Kline said that he initially . thought there had been a medical emergency aboard the boat, which is why . it was not there when he and Mr Garcia surfaced 55 minutes into the . first dive after studying coral reef. He said he assumed another boat . would be sent back for them. Instead, the other divers on the trip . had already boarded and the boat was en route to the second dive site . with the captain unaware he had left the two behind. Mr Kline said they . realised after a while that they had been forgotten. The two, who did not previously know each other, were recovering in Miami today while coastguards launched an investigation. Sasha Boulanger, owner of South Beach . Divers, which organised the trip, was due to meet Mr Kline today to apologise. But he said the incident was the fault of RJ Diving . Ventures, the boat operators he contracted to take the divers out, and . not his own company, which he said enjoyed an 'excellent' safety record. Rescue: The 'No Compromise' was heading back to Miami from Key Largo when it stopped to pick up the stranded divers . 'We are the ones who facilitate the trip and connect A with B,' Mr Boulanger told the Miami Herald. 'I must assume a certain degree of . responsibility, but unfortunately, this falls on (RJ Diving),' he said. 'They are in control of the divers and their security.'

Controversial: Nutritionist Pierre Dukan has been struck off as a doctor in France after he was accused of giving dangerous advice to teenagers . A diet guru whose fans include the Duchess of Cambridge's mother has been struck off the medical register in France after being accused of misadvising teenagers. Pierre Dukan, 70, asked to be removed from the doctors’ list at his own request because he was facing disciplinary action. The nutritionist had used a book to propose ideal weights for 17 and 18 year-old school pupils, giving them extra exam marks if they kept to them. It led to a formal complaint from the College of Physicians in Paris, who said that the scheme could lead to increased cases of obesity and anorexia. The physicians said Dukan’s proposal was in breach of article 13 of the medical ethics code which states: ‘A doctor must be aware of the repercussions his views can have on the public.’ There was also an allegation that Dukan’s £80 million plus slimming business might be in breach of medical codes. But Dukan insisted that the advice contained in his best-selling books was all part of a doctor’s right to freedom of expression. Dukan had retired as a medical practitioner anyway, and so insisted that the disciplinary proceedings were void. Now medical ethics chiefs have told La Croix newspaper that Dukan asked to be struck off the register on April 19. Dr Irene Kahn-Bensaude, head of the Paris branch of the Physicians’ College, said: ‘I think he made this decision when he saw things were not going his way in medical ethics circles.’ Fan: The Dukan Diet is said to be followed by the Duchess of Cambridge's mother Carole Middleton, left, pictured with daughter Pippa . She suggested that Dukan’s move was part of a damage limitation exercise because a guilty verdict might damage his diet guru business. And Dr Kahn-Bensaude insisted that Dukan’s move would not halt the disciplinary action against him, and that charges ‘will go all the way’. Last year experts from the British Dietetic Association named the Dukan Diet the worst celebrity weight loss plan, saying it has 'absolutely no solid science behind it at all'. The Dukan Diet is said to be followed by the Duchess of Cambridge’s mother Carole Middleton, as well as Jennifer Lopez, supermodel Gisele Bundchen and Welsh singer Katherine Jenkins. Weight-loss: It is also believed that Jennifer Lopez, supermodel Gisele Bundchen and Welsh singer Katherine Jenkins, pictured, all follow the controversial diet . It has also been suggested that the Duchess of Cambridge has also followed the controversial diet. It is a complicated four-phase diet that starts with a protein-only approach which promotes weight loss of around 7lb per week. It topped the BDA's annual list of the five worst celebrity diets to avoid in the New Year. It works on restricting foods, calories and portion control. However, the BDA says cutting out food groups is not advisable. The BDA said: 'This diet is so confusing, very rigid, full of very French foods that most Brits would run a mile from like rabbit and offal, and even Dr Dukan himself warns of the associated problems like lack of energy, constipation and bad breath.'","Pierre Dukan asked to be removed from the doctors’ list because he was facing disciplinary action .

A plush New York apartment block has been sold for a record fee in excess of $90million - and the new owner hasn't even seen it yet. The astronomical fee eclipses the $88million forked out by Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev on a penthouse for his daughter last winter at 15 Central Park West. It proves that while the economic situation may be precarious some still have deep enough pockets to splash out super properties. Sky high: A penthouse in the under construction One57 tower block in Manhattan has been sold for between $90million and $100million . City living: The property boasts 10,923 square foot of space opposite Carnegie Hall and provides breathtaking views of the city skyline . Views from the castle in the sky will be unparalleled over all of Manhattan, the outer boroughs and beyond . A plan for a his-and-her master bathroom boasts incredible south-facing views of the Empire State building 23 blocks away . A 'recognisable' buyer has snapped up a penthouse on the 89th and 90th floor of the under-construction One57 tower block in Manhattan. 1. Penthouse in One57 on 157 West 57th street: Between $90million and $100million. 2. The Woolworth Mansion on East 80th Street: $90 million. 3. Central Park South condo: $77.5million. 4.

In exchange for the astronomical price the mystery buyer will get a 10,923-square-foot space opposite Carnegie Hall with incredible views over the city. While Extell Development Company has not revealed exactly how much the plush living space has fetched they have said the figure is between $90 - $100million. The high sum is thought to be due to uncertainty abroad, which has led foreign investors taking a greater interest in New York real estate. Situated on 157 West 57th street the tower will become the tallest residential building in the city when it is finished next year. The New York Post has reported that some potential buyers have claimed there are 'design flaws' with the construction - namely that builders failed to provide a sufficient number of elevators. But new owner of the high-rise apartment who according to Extell chairman Gary Barnett is from a 'nice family' clearly didn't share the same concerns. The new 1,000ft building will offer stunning vistas but the enormous structure will block the view from other nearby luxury buildings, which are expected to see their prices fall. Foreign buyers, including Brazilians, Chinese and Russians, have been on keeping New York and Miami real estate sellers busy in recent months, developers and brokers say. Russian and Ukrainian buyers have shown a particular willingness to pay large sums for 'trophy' properties. However, Mr Barnett insisted the person who had purchased the penthouse apartment was not from Russia or the Ukraine. No doubt the owners will be able to afford good window treatments if they want to block out the incredible lights visible from the master bedroom in order to sleep . High above the rest: Residents in the penthouse of the shimmering glass tower will look down on their neighbors . Reaching for the skies: Construction is expected to finally be finished in 2013. When finished the building the building will appear as at right . The $100million mark for an apartment in New York has yet to be surpassed but earlier this year Mr Barnett said a foreign investor was 'very seriously looking' at the Winter Garden unit - a duplex featuring a solarium totaling 13,500ft. The buyer was looking at buying  that apartment and another floor to create a 20,000 square feet space for a price of between $100 and $150 million, Mr. Barnett said.","Property purchased by mystery buyer .

Douglas-O’Callaghan was ordered to be detained during Her Majesty’s Pleasure with a minimum term of 18 years. Judge Hawkins told them: 'The two of you quickly despatched Devon Scarlett without mercy.' Mr Scarlett and Campbell got into an early morning spat involving others at the fast-food restaurant in Brixton, south London, in April 2010. They were escorted outside by security guards, but the row carried on and the two strangers agreed to meet in a nearby street for a shoot-out, said Bobbie Cheema, prosecuting. 'Showed lack of respect': Devon Scarlett was shot twice by Campbell in an alley after acting with 'foolish bravado', the trial heard . Campbell called Douglas-O’Callaghan to bring his 'thing', or gun, a retrial was told. Mr Scarlett appeared to make a similar call but no actual call was made. Miss Cheema said: 'Horace Campbell was determined to avenge the perceived lack of respect that Devon Scarlett showed him. 'Devon Scarlett acted with foolish bravado, behaving like a tough guy, but whatever he said and did, he was not armed.' Campbell, who had been drinking, followed Mr Scarlett into Marcus Garvey Way and fired three shots, two of them hitting the victim. Campbell said: 'You are not so hot now', before walking away. Mr Scarlett, of Croydon, who was born Raymond Mitchell, died a few hours later in hospital. Campbell, of Anerley, and Douglas-O’Callaghan, of Tulse Hill, both south London, denied murder. 'Trivial': Mr Scarlett and Campbell got into an early morning spat involving others at the McDonald's in Brixton, south London, in April 2010 . The court heard that Mr Scarlett had become involved in 'someone else’s argument' in McDonald’s at around 6.30am on April 17 last year. Outside, Mr Scarlett was heard saying he had been shown disrespect, and Campbell said Mr Scarlett was 'going to be shot in the head'. When people tried to intervene, Campbell told them Mr Scarlett had been 'too disrespectful and was going to be shot in the head' and would be 'filled up with lead'. A woman had heard them agreeing to meet in the nearby street, 'effectively for a shoot-out', jurors were told. Detective Inspector Henry Lindsley said: 'Unbelievably, Devon Scarlett’s murder was triggered by the most minor of incidents that Horace Campbell chose to involve himself in.

A previously unknown work by the Italian master Canaletto today sold for nearly £2million after spending a century with owners who didn’t know what it was. Art experts were stunned when the family who owned it phoned them about the lost drawing of the market place in Venice. The vendors had no idea of the value of the 10x14 inch work until they made enquiries about selling it with London auctioneers Sotheby’s. Famed Venetian painter Canaletto created the work in the mid-18th century and it shows the market square, paved in 1758, ten years before his death. A previously unknown work by the Italian master Canaletto of the market place in Venice has sold for nearly £2m today. The drawing shows the church of San Giacomo with the Ruga degli Orefici leading right up to the Rialto bridge . Canaletto often moved buildings around for his works but with this drawing he tinkered only slightly and the 18th century scene looks almost identical today (above) The drawing was acquired in 1876 by the French landscape and genre painter Charles-Theodore Sauvageot. It has remained in private hands ever since, being passed down his family until his unnamed descendants sold it at the auction house. Enthusiasts and experts had no knowledge of it and it was never referred to in books despite it staying with the same French family. The emergence of the work - the first drawing by Canaletto to come on the market in around 30 years - delighted both scholars and the art world. Born . Giovanni Antonio Canal and nicknamed Canaletto, which means 'little . canal', he lived most of his life at Corte Perin, in a modest apartment . in the San Marco district of Venice. Following . his father Bernardo into painting theatrical scenery, his fame and . money came later when he moved on to depict daily urban Venetian life. Оne оf hіs finest early pieces іs The Stonemason's Yard whіch depicts а humble working area оf the city. Canaletto later became known fоr hіs grand scenes оf canals аnd the Doge's Palace. He spent several years painting in England, which brought him even closer to his rich clients. He died in 1768 in the apartment where he had lived for most of his life. He never married. It sold for a hammer price of £1.7million but with fees added on, the overall price paid was £1.94million. Greg Rubinstein, head of old master drawings at Sotheby’s, said: 'This work is completely unknown. The owners are the descendants of the man who bought it in 1876. They phoned up and I was going to Paris and arranged to meet them. 'Although they had been told it was by Canaletto, they had no idea quite how wonderful it was or what it might be worth. 'I said that it was not just a Canaletto drawing; it was fantastic, amazing. I gave them the estimate and they were pleasantly surprised. 'Their ancestor’s collection was split up over the years between the family members. 'The current owners are not particularly wealthy, but importantly they looked after it. 'Many Canaletto drawings are hung in too much light and they lose the sparking light, which is the important thing. Only a minority of his drawings are in a great condition like this.' Mr Rubinstein said the price paid for . the Canaletto is a record for a drawing by the artist, easily dwarfing . the previous sum of £493,103 paid in 1986. Giovanni Antonio Canal - better known as . Canaletto - was a Venetian painter of landscapes and an important . printmaker in etching. He often moved buildings around for his works but with this drawing he tinkered only slightly and the 18th century scene looks almost identical today. It was drawn in pen and brown ink over numerous ruled chalk lines with grey wash to make the tones. It shows the church of San Giacomo with the Ruga degli Orefici leading right up to the Rialto bridge. And it is made far more interesting by the numerous people going about their business in the market square. He drew the scene many times through his career and it is one of the city’s most picturesque places and is the centre of Venice’s banking industry. Mr Rubinstein said: 'Canaletto painted the scene several times during his life and this was drawn in the late 1750s or early 1760s. 'He has tinkered with it a bit and played a little bit fast and loose and you can’t stand in one place and see everything in this scene. But that’s his genius.' There was huge interest when the drawing went under the hammer. Mr Rubinstein said: 'Its appearance . at auction today generated huge excitement, culminating in an intense . bidding battle between six determined collectors. 'Together they drove the price to a . sum more than five times the original estimate and four times the . previous record for a drawing by the artist.

In hospital: Mr Nastase was prime minister from 2000 to 2004 and headed the Social Democracy Party from 2000 to 2005 . Romania's former prime minister is to undergo surgery following an apparent suicide attempt, hours after being told he will be jailed for corruption. Adrian Nastase reportedly shot himself in the neck after the country's highest court ruled that he must serve a two-year prison sentence for illegally raising funds for a failed presidential campaign. He had appealed against a March 30 court ruling that sentenced him to prison, but the Supreme Court upheld the sentence, sending shockwaves throughout the country. Plastic surgeon Ion Lascar said today that doctors will try to repair Mr Nastase's bullet wounds, but did not say when. Nastase had been found guilty of illegally raising €1.6 million . (£1.3 million) during his 2004 election campaign, when he ran for . president on behalf of the Social Democrat Party. The conviction came . after more than 1,000 days of trial and testimony from more than 900 . witnesses. As a former prime minister, he would be Romania's most senior politician to serve time in prison since the 1989 fall of communism. The trial sent a signal to the European Union which had urged Romania to crack down on endemic corruption. The Eastern European country's legal system has often been criticised for being under political influence. National news agency Agerpres reported that the General Prosecutor's office said it was investigating a suicide attempt by the former prime minister. Late last night, Prime Minister Victor Ponta, a close ally, visited Mr Nastase in hospital and said his condition was 'under control'. Friends in high places: Mr Nastase meets former British Prime Minister Tony Blair in 2003 . 'It is my right and obligation to visit him,' Mr Ponta said. 'I couldn't stay at home without seeing what was wrong.' Mr Ponta would not detail Mr Nastase's wound, but the Antena 3 and Mediafax news agencies said he shot himself in the neck after police arrived at his home to arrest him. Images broadcast on Antena 3 showed Mr Nastase being brought carried out of an ambulance into hospital on a stretcher covered with a blue blanket. His lawyer, Ion Cazacu, said Mr Nastase was conscious when he saw him at the hospital. 'I spoke to him after the court ruling and he was calm and responsible,' Mr Cazacu added. High profile: Mr Nastase following a previous meeting with Tony Blair in 2001 poses outside 10 Downing Street with wife Dana, far left, Mr Blair's wife Cherie . Serban Bradisteanu, a doctor at the hospital, said that doctors were likely to operate on Mr Nastase later today after his vital functions had stabilised. He said Mr Nastase could speak, but with difficulty. Mr Nastase, who will be 62 on Friday, has insisted that the case against him is politically motivated and indicated he will take it to the European Court of Human Rights. He has claimed that the sentence was unjust, and that his exhausting eight-year-trial felt like a prison sentence of its own. Mr Nastase was prime minister from 2000 to 2004 and headed the Social Democracy Party from 2000 to 2005. He also served as foreign minister from 1990 to 1992, and was also parliamentary speaker. As the news of the high court ruling broke, some Romanians rejoiced at the imprisonment of such a powerful figure, while others said they were dumbfounded. 'Of course, until the end of his life Nastase will say it is an injustice, but it is a landmark in Romanian legal history,' journalist Cristian Tudor Popescu said. '(That) people who appear to be demi-gods can actually be sent to prison.' Judges found Mr Nastase guilty of using fees that he charged companies and state agencies to attend a conference for his unsuccessful 2004 run for the presidency. Mr Nastase lost the runoff vote to President Traian Basescu. According to a 2011 Transparency International report, Romania is one of the most corrupt countries in the European Union, which it joined in 2007.","Adrian Nastase was jailed for illegally raising funds for a failed presidential campaign .

With the worst wildfire in their state's history ripping through massive swathes of woodland, residents of central Colorado could have been forgiven for thinking things couldn't possibly get any worse. But authorities were yesterday forced to ground aircraft tackling parts of the enormous blaze amid reports of a meteor shower raining down on the very same area. There have been several sightings of objects falling from the sky close to the fire burning 1,100 acres, or nearly 2 square miles, west of Colorado Springs. Wildfires: But authorities tackling a huge blaze in Colorado were . forced to ground their aircraft amid reports of a meteor shower . Chaffee County Sheriff W. Peter Palmer said his office received multiple reports, including one person who thought a meteorite might have landed in a wooded area north of Buena Vista. Meanwhile, the crew of a heavy air tanker spotted something while making a run to dump slurry on the blaze, said Steve Segin, a spokesman for the U.S. Forest Service. 'They weren't sure what it was,' Segin said, confirming the report of a possible meteor shower. 'They landed as they normally do to reload, and for safety reasons they grounded themselves until they could figure out what it was they saw,' he said.

The Colorado sightings corresponded with reports of a possible meteor filed by the crews of two commercial aircraft over Liberal, Kan., said meteorologist Scott Entrekin of the National Weather Service in Boulder. Ian Gregor, a spokesman with the Federal Aviation Administration, said he had no such reports. He also said there were no reported disruptions to commercial airline traffic. Fire officials ordered four single-engine aircraft to stay on the ground as a precaution. Two heavy air tankers were also affected. The planes soon resumed their attack on the fire, Entrekin said. The groundings came as firefighters were taking advantage of a break in the heat to ramp up their attack against wildfire burning on more than 100 square miles in the northern part of the state.

Today we're going to be aggressive,' said Bill Hahnenberg, who is leading the fight against the 65,738-acre fire west of Fort Collins. Conditions were also better in central Colorado near Lake George, where the blaze is more than 20 percent contained, despite the meteor warning. A fire that broke out Tuesday in northwestern Colorado spread to about 3 square miles, or 2,000 acres, forcing some evacuations in a subdivision, but residents were able to return that night.

The younger brother of disgraced financier Bernard Madoff - the loyal No. 2 at an investment firm that fronted a multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme - pleaded guilty Friday, agreeing to serve 10 years in prison and saying he was 'in total shock' when he learned of the fraud. Peter Madoff, 66, entered the plea Friday in a deal that permits him to remain free pending an October 4 sentencing. He had been taken into custody at his lawyer's midtown Manhattan office earlier in the morning. The plea came in the same Manhattan courthouse where Bernard Madoff was led away in handcuffs in 2009 to serve a 150-year sentence. In handcuffs: Peter Madoff, left, is driven to Federal Court after being arrested by FBI agents in New York today . Taken away: The FBI said on Friday it had arrested Madoff, the younger brother of swindler Bernard Madoff, who is serving a 150-year prison sentence for his multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme . Peter Madoff told the judge he was . 'deeply ashamed and terribly sorry' but that he didn't know about the . scam until his brother revealed it in December 2008. 'I was in total shock,' he said of his brother's disclosure. 'My world was destroyed. I lost everything I worked for.' The government has used the . cooperation of six former employees and associates at Bernard L. Madoff . Investment Securities LLC to learn what went on inside the secretive . business. Close to $20 billion vanished in the . scam, the largest Ponzi scheme ever prosecuted in the U.S. The scheme . left behind only a few hundred million dollars, not the $65 billion . claimed in bogus financial statements. Peter Madoff revealed in court that . he agreed to assist his brother in sending out the only money left to . favored people, including friends and family. 'I was shocked and devastated but . nevertheless I did as my brother had said, as I had consistently done . for decades,' he said. 'I knew that the conduct was wrong and I am . deeply ashamed.' The checks never went out. In his guilty plea, Bernard Madoff . admitted his investment advisory business was a sham, but insisted that . his brother and two sons who also worked for him were in the dark about . his misdeeds. Guilty plea: Madoff is poised to plead guilty to charges of securities fraud, false declarations and falsifying documents and was arrested early June 29 ahead of the scheduled court appearance . In court: Peter Madoff is pictured attending a court hearing before judge Stephen Bucaria on April 3, 2009 . The FBI nevertheless had been suspicious from the start . about the role of Peter Madoff, who had worked side by side with his . scheming brother for more than 40 years. Peter Madoff sometimes signed many . weeks of compliance reports in one sitting, intentionally changing pens . and ink colors to make it appear he had signed them at various times, . Assistant U.S. Attorney Lisa A. Baroni told U.S. District Judge Laura . Taylor Swain. She said he also arranged for his wife to have a no-show . job at the company, allowing her to receive salary. Madoff's mug: Once billionaire banker Bernie Madoff is currently serving an 150-year sentence for his elaborate Ponzi scheme . FBI Assistant Director Janice K. Fedarcyk said Peter Madoff played an 'essential enabling role' in the . scam by certifying fabricated investment results. 'The Madoff investment empire, built . on a foundation of deceit, was a house of cards that grew to skyscraper . proportions,' she said. 'As Peter Madoff has admitted today, he was one . of the chief architects.' Peter Madoff was being released on $5 . million bail, secured by $1 million in cash or property, pending . sentencing. Prosecutors said Peter Madoff agreed to give up all his . assets. 'Peter Madoff enabled the largest . fraud in human history. He will now be jailed well into old age, and he . will forfeit virtually every penny he has,' U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara . said. 'We are not yet finished calling to account everyone responsible . for the epic fraud of Bernard Madoff and the epic pain of his many . victims.' Friends and business associates had . described the brothers as very close. Their offices in midtown Manhattan . were a few feet apart. Their families vacationed together. Peter Madoff was credited with . creating a computer trading system for the firm in the late 1970s and . early 1980s that was considered groundbreaking at the time. He ran the . daily trading operation while his brother focused on the more secretive . investment advisory arm. Both brothers made a fortune. Peter Madoff owned a Palm Beach, Fla., vacation house that recently sold for $5.5 million. When Bernard Madoff was arrested, . Peter Madoff broke the news to Madoff Securities employees. And he was a . co-signer on a $10 million bond that won his brother's release. Through . attorneys, he denied any wrongdoing. Bernard Madoff (centre) is seen walking out from Manhattan Criminal Court after a bail hearing in Manhattan January 5, 2009 in New York City. Madoff is accused of running a $50 billion Ponzi scheme through his investment company . But the denial didn't stop federal . authorities from moving to freeze Peter Madoff's assets. He agreed not . to dispose of his assets and promised to curtail his personal spending . as the investigation moved forward. His living expenses were capped at . $10,000 a month. A trustee appointed to recover stolen . assets also came after Peter Madoff, accusing him of financing his . high-end lifestyle through the fraud. A complaint filed in bankruptcy court . alleged that the Madoff investment business had transferred more than . $77million to Peter Madoff. It said that between 1993 and 2008, he was . paid a total of $36million in salary and bonuses. And it identified other income for . Peter Madoff as memberships to country clubs, including Glen Oaks Club . in New York and one of Donald Trump's country clubs. Given Peter Madoff's 'level of . financial experience and sophistication,' he either knew or should have . known that he reaped gains from 'fraud and deception,' the trustee . alleged. The trustee also took aim at his . daughter Shana, who once worked as an in-house lawyer at the firm and . has denied involvement in the scheme. 'Had Peter, as the Chief Compliance . Officer, or Shana, as Compliance Counsel, done their jobs properly, the . fraud might have been revealed years earlier,' the complaint said. 'Either they failed completely to carry out their required . supervisory/compliance roles, or they knew about the fraud but covered . it up.' Defense lawyers responded by branding . the complaint 'a sensationalistic attempt to lump together members of . the Madoff family and create liability by association.'

If they are still in bed, police get the parents to wake them up before driving them to lessons. Clampdown: School truants are being hauled out of bed by police and escorted to classes in a patrol car (file picture) The crackdown is the first of its kind and was launched last week in Amesbury, Wiltshire. Inspector Christian Lange, the town’s police chief, said it is already producing results. He said: 'So far, one early morning visit from the police has been enough. 'It’s not good for the parents when their neighbours see us knocking on their doors and taking their kids off to school.' Each morning, police officers are provided with a list of children who have failed to turn up at school without a reasonable explanation. Insp Lange said: 'Of course, if they are off sick or there is a good reason then we don’t intervene. 'If they are still in bed, we get their parents to wake them up, we put them in the car and deliver them straight to school.' Officers are accompanied by an education welfare officer and are working closely in partnership with Wiltshire Council and local schools. Targeting truants: Inspector Christian Lange, the town's police chief, said the scheme is already producing results . It is hoped the crackdown will help reduce antisocial behaviour in the town and ensure that children are getting their education. Insp Lange said: 'The correct place for a child of that age to be is in school. 'If they are not in school they are more likely to get into trouble - it’s not good for anyone to be hanging around, doing nothing all day. 'Truancy is a recurring problem for a small number of children. They are missing out on their education, and if us waking them up and taking them to school is what is needed, then that is what we will do. 'So far we have been very pleased with the results, it is early days but we are taking truancy very seriously. 'It is a real example of a partnership working and getting things done.' Parents have a legal responsibility to ensure their children attend school until they are 16. From next year the school leaving age is due to rise to 17, and to 18 in 2015. Fixed penalty notices and fines can be issued if parents fail to make sure their children go to school along with parenting contracts and parenting orders designed to enforce attendance.","Officers crack down on truants by calling at homes of pupils who fail to turn up to school without a reason .

The Prime Minister held at least two private conversations with Mrs Brooks that have not been disclosed by Downing Street and warned her they could not be seen together, it says. The book, an updated unofficial biography of the Prime Minister, reveals that Mr Cameron and Mrs Brooks met at the Heythrop point-to-point, a race meeting run by a hunt near both their homes in Oxfordshire. Friends: David Cameron and Rebekah Wade at a book launch in 2009. An updated biography of the PM claims he texted the former News International chief executive just days before she resigned . Close: Mr Cameron embraces the former News of the World editor at a party . Before they met Mr Cameron and Mrs Brooks texted each other to make sure they were not seen together, it alleges. The meeting is significant because it . came on January 23, 2011 – two days after Mr Coulson was forced to . resign as communications director as the hacking scandal spread. Attending the infamous Christmas dinner with Rebekah Brooks and James Murdoch at which the BSkyB bid was discussed was a mistake, David Cameron confessed two weeks ago. The Prime Minister insisted he made no 'grand deal' with the pair in exchange for their media empire's support for the Tories. Mr Cameron admitted having a conversation with Mr Murdoch over his father Rupert's proposed takeover of BSkyB at a party at the Oxfordshire home of Mrs Brooks, who is now on police bail in the phone-hacking investigation. His remarks came amid claims Mrs Brooks, a senior executive at Rupert Murdoch's News International, is ready to disclose all private email and text message exchanges with Mr Cameron. The dinner party took place on December 23, 2010, just two days after Business Secretary Vince Cable was stripped of responsibility for adjudicating on the BSkyB deal after boasting of having 'declared war' on the Murdoch empire. Mr Cameron claimed he did not recall the exact details of his conversation with James Murdoch, but said it concerned the controversy over Mr Cable. He was a close ally of Mrs Brooks and her successor as editor of the News of the World, where phone hacking took place. A second meeting between Mr Cameron . and Mrs Brooks at the Chipping Norton fair was also not disclosed by No . 10 when they released a list of Mr Cameron’s meetings with media . executives.

"By . Luke Salkeld . PUBLISHED: . 06:52 EST, 9 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:16 EST, 9 May 2012 . A hugely expensive and controversial wind farm was given the government’s go-ahead yesterday, building a permanent ‘blight on the countryside’, campaigners said. The £365million project, the biggest ever in England and Wales, will involve erecting 76 turbines - each of which will stand 475ft tall. Countryside lovers, who have been fighting the proposal for almost two decades, said the farm would be ‘ugly’ and ruin the local landscape of hills and valleys. The beautiful South Wales countryside which campaigners fear could be ruined by plans to build a wind farm . But despite their petitions and appeals, they lost their struggle when permission was granted to build what will be among the highest turbines in Europe across 155 acres of countryside. Each taller than the London Eye (443ft), it is claimed they will be able to produce enough energy to supply 206,000 homes. But to those opposed to the Pen-y-Cymoedd development in South Wales, say that electricity will come at far too high a price for the area. A spokesperson for the Glyncorrwg Action Group, named after an affected village, said: ‘Wind farms are ugly, inefficient and will spoil the wild beautiful areas around the village. ‘Our fight against the wind farm developers is one of David against Goliath, big business against small vulnerable communities. ‘Measures should be introduced to prevent the free for all by developers, that is taking place in areas such as Glyncorrwg.’ Energy Minister Charles Hendry (pictured) who supports the proposed scheme . He continued: ‘This ugly, industrial . wind farm development is totally unfair and it would ruin our landscape . and our hopes to develop tourism. ‘This proposal will be detrimental to our future, short-term gain will lead to long term losses of our beautiful landscape.’ The development on rural land between the Welsh towns of Neath and Aberdare, was given the backing of the energy ministry. The wind farm is being built by Swedish company Vattenfall is likely to cost around £300 million, with construction starting as early as next year. Despite vocal objections local councils chose not to block to the scheme. Former Welsh Assembly Member Dr Brian Gibbons, who has seen the detailed plans, said the move forward was a ‘disappointment’. He added: ‘It is too big and far too intrusive to our local communities.’ The site of the farm is owned by the . Forestry Commission Wales, which has worked with the company on the . proposal, and is backed by the Welsh wing of the RSPB, whose director . commented: ‘RSPB Cymru welcomes the positive approach Vattenfall has . taken to nature conservation through the Pen y Cymoedd wind farm - an . approach which will result in a net gain for wildlife in this area.’ Wind turbines are being switched off in Scotland because of fears for children's safety. Up to 16 turbines at school sites in The Scottish Highlands are affected by the move, in what is being described as a 'precautionary measure' by council bosses. The machines are being turned off following concerns raised by Highland councillors and residents earlier this year. The building of two new turbines in Scotland have also been postponed. SNP’s Inverness Central member Donnie Kerr, voiced concerns about their safety and refused to back their construction due to a lack of exclusion zone in either scheme. Despite the turbine shutdown, however, Steve Barron, Highland council’s deputy chief executive has vowed to continue to press on with renewable energy schemes. She . added: ‘We hope that other companies will adopt a similar attitude and . that that this project will set the gold standard for wind farm . developments in Wales and, indeed, elsewhere.’ Vattenfall . has pledged a benefits package to the community said to be worth £55 . million, including £3 million for habitat management and £6,000 a year . for each megawatt of electricity paid into a community fund. Energy Minister Charles Hendry said: ‘Onshore wind plays an important role in enhancing our energy security.‘It is the cheapest form of renewable electricity and reduces our reliance on foreign fuel. ‘This . project in South Wales will generate vast amounts of home-grown . renewable electricity and provide a significant benefits package for the . local community.’ The green light for the project comes . after the Government released a joint report with industry body . RenewableUK highlighting the benefits to the economy of onshore wind, . including for local communities.

Piers Guy, Vattenfall’s head of onshore wind development in the UK, said: ‘Pen y Cymoedd is a major project that could be worth more than £1 billion to the UK economy. ‘We have consistently stated our commitment to making sure that we maximise the value of Pen y Cymoedd to the region and to Wales. This is now our priority.’ Campaigners are angry about the proposed wind farm project, which could look similar to these turbines erected in Lincolnshire (pictured) Last month plans to build the world’s largest wind farm at one of Britain’s top tourist attractions are facing new opposition after protestors mocked up a video showing how the giant turbines will ‘blight’ the heavily-protected Jurassic Coast. The £3 billion farm will be visible to the millions of tourists who visit the Dorset and Isle of Wight coast every year - and tourism chiefs fear it will drive visitors away from the area, currently England’s only natural World Heritage site. It also emerged that the Royal Family could soon be cashing in on dozens of wind turbines - even though they have been condemned by Prince Charles and Prince Philip. Energy firms have been given the green light for 45 windmills on Crown Estate land, which will rake in £1million a year in subsidies. Homeowners living next door to the prospective wind farms in Wales and Lincolnshire accused the Royal Family of hypocrisy, after the Prince of Wales described them as a ‘horrendous blot on the landscape’ while his father called them ‘useless’ and ‘a disgrace’.","Campaigners fear project will cause irreversible damage to countryside .

He was seen lying on a spinal board stretcher with his face bloodied while paramedics treated him. Hurt: Michael McKean lies on a stretcher with a bloodied face while being treated by paramedics . Mr McKean with his wife actress Annette O'Toole: He is now recovering in hospital . The car which struck him - as well as seeming to knock over a trash can and a mail box on the sidewalk - had a giant hole in its smashed windshield. The star, who is celebrated as the fictional lead singer David St Hubbins in the spoof heavy metal band movie This Is Spinal Tap, is now recovering in hospital. His wife, actress Annette O’Toole, was today flying from their home in Los Angeles to be by her husband’s side . Harriet Sternberg, his spokeswoman, said: 'He has sustained multiple injures and we are trying to find out the extent of other injuries. Hopefully, he’ll be fine.' His condition was today listed as stable. He was taken by ambulance to St Luke's hospital after being hit at about 3pm yesterday at the intersection of West 86th Street and Broadway. The three passengers in the vehicle were also taken there after suffering minor injuries. The actor, who is starring in the Broadway production of Gore Vidal's political drama Best Man, will miss tomorrow night's show. Miss Sternberg said: 'He’s upset about missing his curtain. He’s never missed a performance in his career.' It means an understudy will have to stand in for the star for the first time in his 40-year career. Mr McKean had been playing the role of Dick Jenson since the beginning of April. The show is due to run three times a week at the Gerard Shoenfield theatre until September 9. It is unknown whether Mr McKean, who was born in New York City, will be able to continue in the production. The star is best known for the cult 1984 movie This Is Spinal Tap, which started life on an ABC sketch show in 1979. When the film aired it became an instant hit in both the U.S. and Britain. Its accompanying soundtrack was also very popular. Mr McKean joined members of the fictional group reunited in 1992 for a real world tour and have since carried out three more. He also played Lenny in the hit television comedy show Laverne & Shirley.

Incredible footage of the landmark event has been uploaded to YouTube with users awestruck by the images. When White eased himself out of Gemini IV he was travelling at nearly 18,000mph, 178 miles above Hawaii. He floated and maneuvered himself around the craft while logging 6,500 miles during his orbital stroll.

A wealthy businessman and his wife were found dead at their remote home in an Estonian forest after suffering carbon monoxide poisoning, an inquest heard today. Banker Philip Townsend, 55, and wife Mary Anne, 52, were discovered dead by a plumber on February 24 at the property in Taheva near Koiva Kula, the inquest at Norwich Coroner’s Court was told. A police investigation was launched and Mrs Townsend’s brother, James Wilson, flew to Estonia to ensure there had been no foul play. An investigation by a local police chief, Senior Superintendent Ulle Oras, found they were likely to be have been killed by fumes from a petrol-powered electricity generator. Norfolk coroner William Armstrong recorded a verdict of accidental death. He said: 'It is very clear that the police investigation found no evidence of any third party involvement or any suspicious circumstances.' Mr Townsend, who used the title Baron Townsend of Rathmore, had been the research director of Moscow-based investment firm Enza Capital since 2010. Their main home was a 16th century manor house in Wood Dalling, Norfolk, and they also had a flat in Kensington, London. The couple, who had two teenage children, had been renovating the barn in Estonia since buying the land in 2009. The house was in a remote, sparsely populated rural location in the middle of woodland, with no mains electricity. Local handyman Andres Saretok had been hired to oversee the renovations and had frequently warned Mr Townsend the doors to the generator room should be left open, the inquest heard. He visited the couple the night before the deaths and repeated the warning. Secluded: Mr Townsend's rural Estonian barn conversion, where he and his wife were discovered dead . Police were called after Olev Podenat arrived at the house the next day to fix a burst water pipe. Mr Townsend was found near the generator with an empty petrol can and Mrs Townsend was found nearby at the bottom of some stairs. Officers found the doors closed and an exhaust pipe had been disconnected, possibly after somebody tripped on it, Mr Oras’s statement said. Mr Wilson, a Norfolk farmer, said he had flown to Estonia with another relative five days after the deaths. He told the inquest: 'We went to find out for ourselves what had happened. We were able to establish, as far as we could, that there were no suspicious circumstances.' A post-mortem carried out in Estonia and verified by the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital found the pair died from asphyxiation caused by vomiting as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning. Mr Armstrong said: 'Mr Townsend was clearly an intelligent and capable man. 'He had been told on several occasions the doors should be left open, yet it seems they were closed.'","Philip Townsend, 55, and wife Mary Anne, 52, were discovered dead by a plumber on February 24 at the property in Taheva near Koiva Kula .

Roger Clemens has been cleared of all charges as a jury decided he didn't lie to Congress when he denied using performance-enhancing drugs, closing the book on a five-year saga that had the former pitcher's impressive career clouded by allegations of steroid use. Jurors returned their verdict Monday after close to 10 hours of deliberation. The verdict brought an end to a 10-week trial that capped an expensive, five-year probe into one of the greatest pitchers in the history of baseball, who pitched for the Boston Red Sox, Toronto Blue Jays, New York Yankees and Houston Astros in his 24-year career. Scroll down for video . Emotional: Clemens fights back tears as he speaks outside the Prettyman U.S. Court House after the not guilty verdict was handed down . Competitor: Clemens was a dominant force on the baseball field in his 24-year career with four major league teams, including the Boston Red Sox and the New York Yankees . Clemens, 49, was accused of . perjury, making false statements and obstructing Congress when he . testified at a deposition and at a nationally-televised hearing in . February 2008. The charges centered on his repeated denials that he used steroids and human growth hormone during his career. Outside the courthouse, Clemens thanked his family members and the former teammates for their support during the intense legal battle. Fighting back tears, the man known as 'The Rocket' again pushed aside claims that he used performance enhancing substances, saying: 'I put a lot of hard work into that career.' Smiles: Clemens walks out of court with his wife Debbie, left, after his acquittal in the perjury case . The verdict is the latest blow to the government's pursuit of athletes accused of drug use. The government's case relied heavily . on the testimony of Clemens' longtime strength coach, Brian McNamee, who . testified that he injected Clemens with steroids in 1998, 2000 and 2001 . and with HGH in 2000. McNamee produced a needle and other materials he said were from a steroids injection of Clemens in 2001, items that McNamee said he stored in and around a Miller Lite beer can inside a FedEx box for some six years. But McNamee was the only person to claim firsthand knowledge of Clemens using steroids and HGH, and even prosecutors conceded their star witness was a 'flawed man.' Star witness: Brian McNamee, Clemens' strength coach, said that he injected the former pitcher with steroids on several different occasions. He was the only witness to claim firsthand knowledge of Clemens using steroids . A force on the field: Clemens won the Cy Young Award seven times and was crowned Most Valuable Player in 1986 . McNamee was arrested in 2001 for allegedly raping a woman in a Florida hotel pool who was later found to have ingested a date rape drug. The rape case was one detail that Clemens' lawyers used in their relentless attacks on McNamee's credibility and integrity. They also pointed out that his story had changed over the years and implied that he conjured up the allegations against Clemens to placate federal investigators. Some items associated with the beer can . were found to have Clemens' DNA and steroids, but the defence called the . evidence 'garbage' and claimed it was contaminated or manipulated by . McNamee, a former New York City police officer. Dubbed 'The Rocket' during his baseball career, Clemens has been dodging allegations that he had used performance enhancing drugs since his name appeared in the Mitchell Report in 2007. He was also mentioned in Jose Canseco's book Juiced: Wild Times, Rampant 'Roids, Smash Hits & How Baseball Got Big, where the former slugger accused Clemens of using steroids. With Clemens' acquittal, the sports world will wait to see the results of the National Baseball Hall of Fame vote, as Clemens will be eligible for induction for the first time. Other eligible names, including former sluggers Mark McGwire and Rafael Palmeiro, have also had highly impressive careers, but have not received baseball's highest honour due mostly to allegations of drug use. When Clemens does appear on a hall of fame ballot next year, his name will appear with home run king Barry Bonds, whose record-breaking numbers have also been called into question due to alleged steroid use. Clemens capped an outstanding career with age-defying performances well into his 40s. He won a seventh Cy Young Award - the most among any other pitcher - at the age of 41 after going 18-4 in 2004 with the Houston Astros. In addition, his 4,672 strikeouts rank him . third all-time. Clemens . was invited to testify before the House Oversight and Government Reform . Committee in 2008 after he publicly denied accusations made in the . Mitchell Report on drugs in baseball that he had used steroids and HGH. He first appeared at a congressional deposition, where he said: 'I never used steroids. Never performance-enhancing steroids.' He made a similarly categorical denial at a hearing about a week later, appearing alongside McNamee, who stuck to his story. Later, . committee chairman Henry Waxman, a California Democrat, and ranking . member Tom Davis, a Republican from Virginia, asked the Justice . Department to investigate whether Clemens had lied under oath. In . 2010, a grand jury indicted him on the six counts. Hardin revealed at the time that federal prosecutors made Clemens a . plea offer but the former pitcher rejected it.

'The rules of engagement of the Turkish Armed Forces have changed given this new development,' Erdogan told parliament following the shooting down of F-4 Phantom jet Friday. The two pilots are still missing. His comments comes as Nato today condemned the shooting of the plane, but stopped short of threatening a military response. Any risk posed by Syria on the Turkish border will be 'considered a threat and treated as a military target,' he said in a jam-packed room of lawmakers who frequently interrupted the address with applause. Erdogan said his government would retaliate 'with determination' and take what he called the 'necessary steps by determining the time, place and method by itself'. The prime minister said Turkey's military jet violated the Syrian airspace for a short time 'by mistake' and repeated that it was unarmed, flying solo when it was shot down by Syria 'without a single warning.' 'We did not receive a single warning, note from Syria (regarding airspace violation)...They acted without warning. This is a hostile act,' Erdogan said. Erdogan said that Turkish airspace had been violated 114 times by military aircraft from different countries, including Syria, since January 1, 2012. 'Hostile act': Erdogan said the F-4 Phantom like the one pictured violated Syrian airspace for a short time 'by mistake' and was shot down 'without a single warning' 'Syrian helicopters violated our . airspace five times'. These were short-term violations to which Turkey . issued the necessary warnings, Erdogan noted. 'This latest development shows that the Assad regime has become a clear and imminent threat to the security of Turkey, as well as for its own people,' he added. Erdogan broke with former friend and ally Assad, whom he called 'a bloody dictator' after unrest that erupted mid-March last year met a bloody response from Damascus, sending more than 33,000 refugees into Turkey. 'Turkey will support Syrian people in every way until they get rid of the bloody dictator and his gang,' he said on Tuesday. Atrocities continue: A handout image released by the Syrian opposition's Shaam News Network shows the bodies of people allegedly killed during a Syrian government offensive kept cool using plastic bottles in the town of Daraa today . Meanwhile, Syrian government forces and rebels were locked in heavy fighting outside Damascus today, activists said, in the worst violence in the suburbs of the capital since an uprising against President Bashar al-Assad began 16 months ago. Video published by activists recorded heavy gunfire and explosions. A thick trail of blood on a sidewalk in the suburb of Qudsiya led into a building where one casualty had been taken. A naked man writhed in agony, his body pierced by shrapnel. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported heavy fighting near the Republican Guard headquarters in Qudsiya, and in the suburbs of al-Hama and Mashrou' Dumar, just 9 km (6 miles) outside Damascus. Samir al-Shami, an activist in Damascus, said tanks and armoured vehicles were also out on the streets of the suburbs and some activists reported that one tank had been blown up. The British-based Observatory, which has a network of activists across Syria, said security forces and armoured vehicles stormed the neighbourhood of Barzeh, an opposition toehold inside Damascus, and there were sounds of heavy gunfire. Video shot by anti-government activists in the city of Homs showed detonations from heavy weapons and plumes of black smoke rising over the rooftops of smashed and abandoned buildings. Macabre: A member of the Syrian free army walks past bodies of government soldiers after they capture their army base in Daret Azzah near Aleppo on Sunday . Aid workers were on their way back to Homs to try to evacuate trapped civilians and wounded, but negotiations are still under way to secure safe access, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said in Geneva. Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said after an emergency meeting in Brussels of ambassadors from NATO's 28 member states that Turkey had the support of all its partners. 'The security of the alliance is indivisible, we stand together with Turkey in the spirit of strong solidarity,' Rasmussen said. 'We consider this act to be unacceptable and condemn it in the strongest terms.' Ankara requested the meeting of NATO's North Atlantic Council to discuss the incident, which it has described as an act of aggression. The meeting was only the second time in NATO's 63-year history that members have convened under Article 4 of its charter, which provides for consultations when a member state feels its territorial integrity, political independence or security is under threat. While supporting one of its members, the alliance has tried to tread carefully, wary of aggravating a conflict which Western governments are reluctant to join in militarily out of fear of a regional sectarian war. 'There is very little appetite from the alliance to undertake what we call a discretionary war,' said Clara Marina O'Donnell, a fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington.","Turkish Prime Minister promises change of attitude to Syrian military .

Kennedy Jr has denied claims he stopped financially supporting his wife in the months before her New York suicide. Lawyers who represented the son of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy in a divorce case pending when Mary Kennedy hanged herself in May issued a statement Monday responding to a New York Post report. The Post said Mary Kennedy's lawyers filed papers alleging her husband cut her off from a court-ordered $20,000-a-month credit card and said she couldn't afford groceries, gas and medical care. Tragedy: Mary Kennedy, ex-wife of Robert Kennedy Jr, was left so impoverished that she could not afford to buy food. Mary was found hanged at the family's estate in Bedford, New York on May 16 . The lawyers said they were owed $278,000. Their firm didn't return calls seeking comment Monday. Robert Kennedy's lawyers say he paid . for food, shelter, education and health care and fully funded the credit . card. They say he wasn't behind in support payments when his wife died. Mrs Kennedy was allegedly left so impoverished by her former husband that she could not afford to buy food. The 52-year-old was found hanged in a barn on the family's estate in Bedford, New York on May 16 by her ex-husband. She . was allegedly so destitute that she was forced to borrow money from . parents of children's classmates in her final months while her former . partner piled on pressure in their divorce battle, questioned her . capability as a mother and flaunted his new girlfriend in public. A source told the Post: 'Somebody living in a fifth-floor walk-up in The Bronx with cash could do more than she could.' It was also revealed in court documents that Mary Kennedy's divorce attorneys had not been paid $278,000 in legal fees promised to them by Robert F Kennedy Jr. The harsh tactics employed by Kennedy apparently left his estranged wife without a $20,000 credit card approved by a court. It meant that she had struggled to live day to day, without the money for groceries, gas or medical care while battling depression and alcoholism. Tumultuous: Robert Kennedy and his estranged wife, Mary were in the middle of a bitter divorce battle which left her with money worries . Troubled: Robert and Mary Kennedy, pictured with three of their children in 2008, were fighting over custody and property . Before Mary's death, RFK Jr had taken to . appearing at public events with their four children - Kyra, Aiden, Conor and William -  who he had full . temporary custody of, and his new girlfriend, 46-year-old actress Cheryl . Hines. The mother-of-four . was found dead by her husband and a housekeeper in an out building at . her $2million mansion in upstate New York. The domestic turmoil surrounding her life extended into . preparations for her funeral. One of Mary's brothers went to court in an . attempt to get custody of her body, while the Kennedys planned to bury . her near the family's seaside compound in Hyannisport, Massachusetts. However at her funeral, her devastated former husband, son of assassinated senator Robert F Kennedy and nephew of JFK, told the congregation: 'I know I did everything I could to help her.' He revealed to mourners that he had . spoken to her the day before her death, and that she told him: 'You know . me better than anyone in the world.' He continued: 'She said, ""I was such a good girl."" I said, ""I know you are - and you still are.""' A special summer exhibit on Jackie Kennedy's life on Cape Cod has opened at the John F. Kennedy Hyannis Museum. The exhibit includes photos, handwritten letters and other artifacts from her time on the Cape. The curator said the exhibit captures Kennedy enjoying carefree days with her family, a different side to the international public figure. It includes a 1953 Life magazine pictorial depicting time she spent on the Cape with John F. Kennedy when they were engaged. Other images chronicle Jackie Kennedy's life on the Cape during her husband's presidency, when the couple and their children would frequent Hyannis Port. The exhibit also includes a display on Jackie Kennedy's 1962 India visit as first lady. Under an agreement made in October, RFK Jr was to pay Mary's household and legal expenses. Both partners were also to have a credit card with a $20,000 limit each month. Robert F Kennedy's decision to cut her off was aimed at putting pressure on his wife while they hammered out the details of a bitter divorce, including who would be left with property and custody of the couple's four children. Last month, details from a a sealed affidavit . written by Robert F Kennedy Jr were made public. Portions of the 60-page confidential divorce document filed in 2011 claimed that Mary Kennedy blackmailed her husband, killed the family dog, drank until she passed out and often . threatened suicide in front of the children. Mary's family dubbed the revelations 'vindictive lies' as the family continued to battle over the late mother's legacy. Mary and Robert Kennedy, who had four children together, married in April 1994 when Mary was six-months pregnant. Their famously tumultuous . relationship began in 1993 while Robert’s marriage to his first wife Emily was coming . to an end after ten years and having two children, Bobby III and Kathleen . ‘Kick’, together. Both regulars at AA, Robert and Mary each suffered from addictive personalities, an article by Newsweek reported. Robert . had infamously battled a drug addiction while Mary had suffered from . anorexia since she attended Putney School in Vermont, where she shared a . room with Robert’s younger sister, Kerry. As the couple's marriage fell apart, . their finances dwindled with legal bills soaring to over $1 million, on . top of the monthly $40,000 cost to maintain the staffed estate. Speaking after Mary's funeral, her . old school friend Kerry Kennedy said that Mary had suffered from mental . illness the entire 37 years they had known one another. Tragic ending: Two years after Robert filed for divorce, Mary was found dead in the family estate's barn. Depressed, in debt and fearing losing custody of her children permanently Mary hanged herself. She was 52 . 'She . struggled so hard, for so long, with mental illness, which so many . Americans suffer with,' Kerry Kennedy said after her death. 'She fought . with dignity, and in the end, the demons won.' Mary and Bobby separated after 16 years of marriage, and while he filed for divorce in 2010 it never went through. The case was pending when she died. Shortly after the split, her internal struggles became public when she was arrested twice on charges of driving while intoxicated. Things appeared to have spiraled out of control in recent years and friends claimed she was drowning in credit card debt, feared she would lose both her home and her children. Bobby Kennedy filed multiple restraining orders against his estranged wife in recent months and sought full custody of their children by claiming she was an unfit mother. Robert Kennedy's lawyer Norman Heller told the Post he had not read the court filings but that the allegations were 'very serious'.","Mary Kennedy's lawyers filed papers alleging her husband cut her off from a court-ordered $20,000-a-month credit card .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 17:24 EST, 3 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 17:24 EST, 3 July 2012 . Sex offender: Adam Lee Brown, pictured in court on Monday, pleaded not guilty to charges of kidnapping, attempted murder and assault . A man on parole for trying to infect children with HIV nearly 20 years ago pulled a boy into a Portland restaurant bathroom over the weekend, attempted to sexually assault him and then stabbed him several times, police said. The 10-year-old's injuries from the attack Sunday were severe enough to require surgery, and officers said he would have died without immediate care. The suspect, Adam Lee Brown, 49, pleaded not guilty Monday in Multnomah County Circuit Court to charges that included kidnapping, attempted murder and assault. He appeared in court surrounded by sheriff's deputies and wearing a so-called 'suicide smock,' a rip-resistant vest that prevents inmates from tearing off strips of clothing to hang themselves. His arrest Sunday after a two-hour standoff in which he was holed up in a Wendy's bathroom marks the second set of child sex abuse charges leveled against Brown, who was the subject of an abuse investigation two decades ago. The HIV-positive son of a church pastor, Brown was convicted in 1993 of three counts of first-degree sodomy, each involving a child. He pleaded no contest to reduced charges - the initial charges included attempted murder because of his HIV. The case came during a peak in the AIDS crisis and amid fears fueled by public misunderstanding that vengeful patients willfully would infect unsuspecting bystanders. At least nine children in the small . logging town of Roseburg told police that Brown molested them over the . course of several months in 1992. Scene of the crime: Brown's arrest came after a two-hour standoff in which he was holed up in a bathroom at this Wendy's location after attacking a 10-year-old boy . According to a criminal complaint, the children said Brown told them not to tell and threatened them with knives, scissors and matches. One child said Brown once burned a Bible, warning that Satan would come if they didn't do what he wanted. Brown's wife at the time, Nancy, told The Associated Press in 1993 that her husband had contracted the disease in Southern California while he was stationed there with the U.S. Marines. A lay preacher at Fair Oaks Community . Church, Brown served nine years in the Marines as a computer technician . before his discharge in the early 1990s. 'God was always in the picture,' Nancy Brown said about her husband's religious upbringing. 'But he . thought Satan would deliver the boys.' Breaking the law: Brown has posed for several mugshots in the last 20 years . Brown spent 11 years in Oregon's prison system, accruing three years of earned time off a 15-year sentence. Prison officials said their records show Brown spent the years 1999-2004 without incurring any disciplinary infractions. Older, paper records were unavailable. On Sunday, police said he pulled the 10-year-old boy into the fast-food restaurant bathroom and locked the door. After the boy fought back, Portland police say Brown stabbed him. A Wendy's employee opened the locked door and Brown shoved the boy out of the bathroom but locked himself inside and told arriving officers that he had a gun. In court: Brown was surrounded by sheriff's deputies and wearing a so-called 'suicide smock,' a rip-resistant vest that prevents inmates from tearing off strips of clothing to hang themselves . Police evacuated the restaurant and brought in crisis negotiators. Brown surrendered. Police found a knife, but no gun. Brown's parents could not be reached Monday by the AP. An attorney representing Brown at the arraignment was unavailable for comment after the hearing. He declined to give his name.","Adam Lee Brown, 49, accused of trying to sexually assault boy and stabbing him when he fought back .

Her body was found in a vacant lot in Frisco, North Carolina, about 20 to 30 miles from where she'd been vacationing. Authorities finally caught up with Summerfield almost a month to the date that a warrant was issued for his . arrest. Nate Summerfield was said to have gone on the run in July after returning the children and telling his brother he strangled his wife. Investigators say she died from strangulation and stab wounds.

Jackenheimer had told family and friends that she was 'hesitant' about . taking the trip with her former partner because he had been violent in . the past. After she . vanished around six weeks weeks ago, police began to hunt around Hatteras . Island in North Carolina, where the pair had been vacationing with her . two children. A construction worker saw . something suspicious and upon investigating realized that it was a dead . body. Alex Taylor, a friend of the missing woman from Ashland, Ohio, told Fox: 'I do know at one point she told Nate she was thinking about not going. 'If I really thought she was in danger, we wouldn’t have let her go.' Summerfield, 27, allegedly returned after murdering his ex-girlfriend to drop off Ms Jackenheimer's 13-year-old daughter and the young boy to their grandparents' homes before fleeing in his car. His brother Jake immediately called 911 to report 'a possible murder'. 'My brother was in North Carolina with . his ex-girlfriend and he came back and said he strangled her. He dropped . his kid off and left,' Jake Summerfield told a dispatcher. He added that he did not know where his brother was going when he sped away in his grey 2009 Honda Civic.

Soft sentences: Judge Gareth Hawkesworth jailed a serial paedophile for just five and a half years . The judge who let a teenage rapist off with a community order handed another soft sentence to a paedophile who preyed on girls as young as five for 36 years, it has been revealed. Judge Gareth Hawkesworth provoked outrage  last week for failing to jail a 14-year-old boy found guilty of raping a girl of four who he was babysitting. Instead he imposed a three-year community order after blaming ‘the world and society’ for his exposure to internet porn. Now it has been revealed that in April this year Judge Hawkesworth jailed a 59-year-old man for just five and a half years despite hearing how he had preyed on six girls aged five to 13 from 1974 until 2010. The pervert, a married man from Hertfordshire, was convicted of nine charges of indecent assault and gross indecency despite each charge carrying a maximum sentence of 14 years to life. After reading about the 14-year-old, one of the man's victims reportedly told the Sun newspaper: 'My heart goes out to the family of the little girl involved in the case with Judge Hawkesworth. 'I too was involved as witness and victim at a sex offender’s trial. 'Along with other victims, I was shocked at the short, soft sentence that the man received and the trauma left to me and all victims involved. 'This man has been at it for over 30 years. It’s destroyed my family. The whole process that we have been through has been soul-destroying. 'I am just starting to rebuild my life and move forward. I want to know whether Judge Hawkesworth will now be investigated.' Last week, the 14-year-old defendant wore his school uniform in the dock as Judge Hawkesworth told him he would have received a six-and-a-half year jail term if he had been an adult. He said: ‘You have not shown any . particular sexual interest in children. I’m satisfied it was impulsive . and I believe you have become sexualised by your exposure to and the . corruption of pornography. ‘Your exposure at such a young age has ended in tragedy. It was the fault of the world and society.’ The schoolboy, who cannot be named for . legal reasons, attacked his victim in December after being paid £10 to . take care of the girl, who lived in a neighbouring house near Cambridge. Devastating: The young girl, who was raped by a 14-year-old boy, with her parents . He was interviewed by police and . revealed he had regularly accessed porn on the internet at his parents’ home without their knowledge. In court he admitted raping a girl under . 13. Julia Flanagan, defending, said it was . a one-off incident and no threat or force was used. She added: ‘We have . a very frightened and remorseful boy who is very ashamed of what he has . done. 'He knows it will follow him for the rest of his life. 'He is marked to some as a sexual deviant for ever.’ The victim’s father told the court he was concerned about the long-term psychological damage she will suffer. The boy will have to register his address with police for the next two-and-a-half years. A sexual offences prevention order was . also made for five years, meaning he must not access pornography of any . kind and cannot use mobile phones or computers without suitable filters . to prevent viewing pornography. The case has fuelled demands for stricter controls to be put in place to stop children accessing online porn . The Daily Mail is calling for an . automatic block under which adult content would be filtered out by . default.

For those that know 70-year-old Larry Ekstrom, taking it easy on his birthday would be the unusual. Opting to celebrate his milestone in a jumpsuit instead, the Madison Heights, Michigan man ceremoniously jumped out of an airplane 70 times in 10 hours on Wednesday and did it all for charity. 'I'd land, step out of harness, step into another, and go back up,' Mr Ekstrom told the New York Daily News. Scroll down for video . Still got it: On Larry Ekstrom's 70th birthday he set a personal best record of skydiving jumps in one day, completing 70 in 10 hours for charity Leader Dogs for the Blind . Topping: Mr Ekstrom topped off his previous record of 60 jumps in one day which he completed on his 60th birthday . He said it took him eight different parachutes to complete his jumps while with the adrenalin rush dually raising money for the Michigan charity Leader Dogs for the Blind that provides seeing-eye dogs to the blind. 'My friend . who works there is the manager,' Mr Ekstrom told WDIV. 'I thought this time would be a . good one.' Each jump started at around 2,000ft taking approximately two and a half minutes to touch down. A group of staff members at Midwest Freefall Sport Parachute Center greeted him at his return, helping him suit up for the next one. The plunge: Each jump started at around 2,000-feet high and took him approximately two and a half minutes to touch down . On his own: Completely unassisted, Mr Ekstrom has 46 years' experience skydiving, ticking off 13,476 jumps he said . Preparation: It took him eight different parachutes to complete his jumps . Success: His last series of jumps ten years ago raised $6,000 to combat multiple sclerosis he said, while adding it exhausted his pilot out before it did him . While Mr Ekstrom is an experienced skydiver with 46 years' experience under his belt - or 13,476 jumps to be exact - the amazing accomplishment wasn't all that unique to him, though it certainly was his personal best. 'I did 60 for 60 for my wife who has [multiple sclerosis],' he told WDIV of his series of jumps ten years' ago. In all he said he raised about $6,000 to fight the disease from that day's jumps alone. He said that if anyone became worn out from it all, it was his pilot. Suiting back up: A group of staff members at the Midwest Freefall Sport Parachute Center were waiting below for him to help him strap up for his next one . Keep moving: Without pausing to get back in the plane, Mr Ekstrom told a reporter that what he was doing was any old milestone but proves somebody can do something . More to come? Mr Ekstrom said that he hopes to top his feat by completing 80 jumps on his 80th birthday . 'I find out ten years later from the pilot that I wore him out,' he said. 'We had a good time doing it.' Approached between jumps on Wednesday and asked his reasoning, he told WDIV: 'It's just another milestone and proves somebody can do something.

Those were some of the words that family and friends used during a funeral service Saturday to fondly remember a law enforcement officer who was among three people killed in a shootout near Texas A&M University. More than 3,000 people attended the service for Brazos County Constable Brian Bachmann at an arena on the A&M campus in College Station. Farewell salute: Law enforcement personnel salute Brazos County Precinct 1 Constable Brian Bachmann during the funeral service on the Texas A&M University Campus on Saturday . Among those in attendance were law enforcement officers from across the state, including Lubbock in West Texas and Hidalgo County in South Texas. A choir of more than 80 people from Bachmann's Methodist church in College Station sang during the service. 'Brian would sacrifice himself for the benefit of others, always,' his mother, Carmen Bachmann, said as she stood on a stage above her son's flag-draped coffin. Gunman in Texas shootout fired more than 65 rounds . Authorities say Bachmann was fatally shot Monday by Thomas Alton Caffall III. The 41-year-old constable was trying to serve Caffall with a court summons for being two months behind on rent. Other officers fatally shot the 35-year-old Caffall. A bystander also was killed in the shootout, and three police officers and a female bystander were wounded. Respects: Mr Bachmann, cloaked in an American flag, is seen brought onto the floor where more than 3,000 people came out to pay their respects to the fallen constable . Memory: Brazos County Sheriff Chris Kirk, right, speaks about the life of Mr Bachmann described as humble, a good friend and a dedicated public servant . Caffall's family has said he was suffering from an unspecified mental illness and has stated, 'It breaks our hearts his illness led to this.' During Saturday's more than 2-and-a-half-hour-long service, the Rev. Tommy Myrick, a pastor at the constable's church, said Bachmann hated serving evictions and when he would have to put someone out of their home, he would do whatever he could to find them a new one. 'He would help them with property transport to a safe place and the thing is he didn't have to do that,' Myrick said. 'Brian was going to try and find that guy (Caffall) a place to live. There's no doubt in my mind when he stepped out of his car (on Monday he was) thinking, `Where will I find this guy a place to live?'' In his honour: Brazos County Sheriff Chris Kirk presents a flag to the constable's wife Donna Bachmann as her daughter Caitlyn Bachmann looks on while holding a gold cross . Mourning: Mr Bachmann's family wipe away tears, with his daughter Caitlyn and son Colby standing beside their mother during their father's funeral service . Comforting: Mrs Bachmann leads in to comforts her daughter Caitlyn while holding her late-husband's flag . Bachmann, who was married and the father of four children, had worked nearly 20 years in law enforcement. He had been a constable since January 2011, after winning election to the post the prior November. Authorities say Bachmann had gone to a home near the university's football stadium to deliver a notice for Caffall to appear in court on Aug. 23 because he owed $1,250 in rent. Officers who later arrived at the scene found Bachmann shot on the lawn of the house. Police say it appears that Bachmann never fired his weapon. Police said officers shot and killed . Caffall after a more than 20-minute shootout. Caffall fired more than 65 . rounds during the incident. Authorities found four weapons in Caffall's . home, including a handgun he took from Bachmann after fatally shooting . him. The other weapons were a semi-automatic sniper rifle, an assault . rifle and a bolt-action rifle. Also killed in the shootout was Chris Northcliffe, 51, who had been checking on a nearby home he owned. Mr Northcliffe's funeral service was held earlier Saturday in College Station, located 100 miles northwest of Houston. The three wounded officers have been . treated and released. The wounded female bystander, Barbara Holdsworth . from Houston, remains hospitalized but her friends say she is improving. Fallen public servant: A bulletin rests on a woman's lap showing the fallen constable who was fatally shot while serving an eviction notice to the 35-year-old gunman Thomas Alton Caffall III . During the funeral service, friends and family members told stories of how Bachmann was dedicated to helping others and how he preferred finding solutions to problems rather than simply writing a ticket. They also talked about his infectious smile and recalled humorous anecdotes about Bachmann's propensity for wrecking patrol vehicles when he was a sheriff's deputy. 'He genuinely wanted to help people,' said Marc Hamlin, the Brazos County district clerk and a close friend of Bachmann's. 'He truly believed that people were good.'

"PUBLISHED: . 09:02 EST, 9 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 10:14 EST, 9 March 2012 . One dangerous motorist has taken 'hands free' driving to a new level after being caught not gripping the wheel at around 40mph. Shocked witness Alan Miller filmed the dangerous driver and even captured the moment she was on the phone with one hand and swearing at him with the other near Rotherham, South Yorkshire. Last week the driving instructor spotted the woman in his car's mirrors and while an experienced 18-year-old pupil was at the wheel he turned in his chair to quickly film the illegal act. Scroll down for video . Caught: The woman is shown clearly on the phone with one hand and swearing with the other at 40 miles per hour . And when she knew she was spotted, instead of gripping the wheel, she just used her other hand to flash the V-sign at him. 'It’s like the threat of three points and a £60 fine isn’t enough of a deterrent for people. Clearly having a phone call is more important to them than safety or the possibility of points on their licence,' he said. Mr Miller said it is a depressingly common example of unsafe driving he sees, adding that he spots motorists illegally phoning while at the wheel up to six times an hour. On the phone: The woman was filmed less than a car length away from a learner driver and this is the moment just before she spots she is being filmed breaking the law . 'This kind of thing happens all the time, it’s a nightmare. I put it online to embarrass the driver and in the hope that she sees it and thinks twice about doing it again,' he said. He keeps the small video camera in his dual-controlled car to document the scene of any accidents, but has increasingly begun to use it as a deterrent to motorists.","Driving instructor Alan Miller captured the moment she was on the phone with one hand and swearing with the other .

Killer: Stephen Streener, outside Newcastle Crown Court, murdered his married lover Jacqueline Grant by strangling her with a piece of synthetic cord and then leaving her body on their burning bed . A killer has been jailed for 18 years after strangling his married lover before setting fire to her body and his own house to destroy any evidence. Pigeon fancier Stephen Streener battered Jacqueline Grant senseless and then killed her by wrapping a cord around her neck in Choppington, Northumberland. The 48-year-old victim had moved into his home when her family thought she was with friends but was brutally murdered in November last year when she wouldn't leave her husband. Streener then tried to cover his tracks by sending loving texts to Mrs Grant, having previously sent one to her husband telling him she was leaving him from her own phone on the day she died. He also told police a 'pack of lies' to try to pin it on her estranged spouse and son, claiming they had hired a hitman to kill her. But now the 49-year-old has been found guilty of her murder after a trial at Newcastle Crown Court and sentenced to life, with a minimum of 18 years. Judge Paul Sloan said: 'Mrs Grant could not bring herself to end her marriage and to inform her husband of her relationship with you. 'I am satisfied that it is you that decided to force the issue of bringing matters to a head, to use Mrs Grant's phone to send texts to her husband informing him Mrs Grant was leaving him. 'Precisely what happened when you returned home having sent that text only you will know. 'But it may well have been the case that you informed Mrs Grant you had sent the text, causing her distress and led to a confrontation between you. Murdered: Jacqueline Grant, right, died brutally at the hands of her lover in November last year, and her killer then tried to pin it on her estranged husband Robert, left . 'Something happened which clearly angered you.' During sentencing, it was heard that Streener had a history of previous convictions dating back to 1979. These included an arson offence in 1981, and in 1984 he was imprisoned for four years for an offence of grievous bodily harm. Judge Sloan added: 'There was clearly a degree of pre-meditation. 'She was clearly vulnerable to an attack from someone she trusted. 'It was because she trusted you that you were able to take her by surprise. Crime scene: Streener set fire to his house in Choppington, Northumberland, with the body of his lover Jacqueline Grant inside . 'You punched her to the head. You then strangled her to death. 'You clearly intended to kill her. 'You have never accepted responsibility for Mrs Grant's death, making false alibis at trial. 'You made a cowardly attempt during the trial to incriminate Mr Grant senior and junior in the killing of Mrs Grant. 'Not withstanding their loss, Mr Grant's fanily have conducted themselves with enormous dignity throughout the course of these proceedings. 'There is only one sentence that can be imposed in your case and that is a sentence of imprisonment for life.' Streener had tried to hide his murder after leaving the crime scene and then turning up again 'in shock'. Investigation: Streener tried to bamboozle police by appearing at the house in shock and later tried to pin it on Jacqueline's husband and son . After the fire was put out a series of love letters between Streener and his lover Mrs Grant had been laid out in the living room, probably to suggest her husband had found them and then killed her. One note, which appeared to be from Mrs Grant to Streener said: 'Love . you darling, from your wife xxxxxx', which was obviously a nickname for . her lover. Mrs Grant’s badly burnt body was then found upstairs on the smouldering bed inside the locked house. After her killing and shortly before the body was found, Streener sent a message to Mrs Grant’s phone, . which he was carrying, that said: 'Hi babe, just finishing pigeons off . then on way for chinese. Darling, I love you darling/ God I love you . sweetheart. xxx' Streener had also been posting on Facebook that he was ‘in love with Jackie G’ and announced they were going to get married. During the trial grieving widower Robert Grant told the court he was convinced his wife was coming back to him and was simply taking time out to think while staying with a friend. He said he knew nothing about the affair she was having with Streener. Mr Grant told the court: 'I just felt like I just needed to give her the time she asked for. 'She said ""I will come back, give me a couple of weeks and I will come back."" 'I didn’t want to start pushing her incase I pushed her away. 'I wanted to carry on with my marriage to Jackie.' Mr Grant said on the day of his wife’s death he received a text message from her phone which said ‘Bob, I’m leaving you for good.’ After he received the message he desperately tried to get in touch with his wife but Streener answered her phone. He then said he was ‘tossing and turning’ in bed that night when the police came to his door to tell him his wife was dead. While giving evidence during the trial Streener claimed Mrs Grant had been killed by a hitman who was hired by Mrs Grant’s husband and son. He said gangsters must have turned up looking for him but strangled his lover when he was not at home. Streener told jurors: 'I’m not saying the Grants were the killers, it was someone on their behalf. 'Someone went in the house that day. Maybe not to murder her, maybe to come after me.' Streener told jurors he and Mrs Grant had been childhood sweethearts but had  gone their separate ways and both married other people. It was just a few months before her death they got back in touch after a chance  meeting. Prosecutors said Streener may have snapped and killed Mrs Grant when she said she wanted to make a go of her marriage rather than continue seeing him. Prosecutor Alistair MacDonald told the court: 'Jacqueline Grant was a lady who had been in a relationship with the defendant and who had been living at the address for three to four months by the time of her death. 'We cannot say whether the fire was set immediately after he killed Mrs Grant or whether he did so later. 'However, the prosecution submit it is clear this fire was set specifically to destroy the evidence of what had happened to Mrs Grant. 'We say that because of the fact the fire was set on the very bed which she was lying, in the areas immediately around the body in more than one location on that bed and also because she was dead by the time the fire started. 'The defendant and Mrs Grant had been having an affair for some months and she had been living there. 'It is clear he wanted Mrs Grant to tell her husband she wanted her marriage to end and wished to marry the defendant.“It may be we will never know if she shared that wish.' The court heard the couple had been on a romantic night away to a hotel in Scotland just before the killing. But Mr MacDonald said: 'Something happened in that house on that morning that led to her being strangled by the defendant and the setting of this fire in an attempt to cover his tracks and to raise the idea it has been an intruder or intruders who committed these acts while he was elsewhere.'","Stephen Streener, 49, has been jailed for a minimum of 18 years for killing Jacqueline Green .

"By . Lucy Buckland . UPDATED: . 06:43 EST, 19 December 2011 . Fatherhood: New dads could be made to sign their child's birth certificate, even if they are estranged from the baby's mother . Fathers could be forced to sign their child’s birth certificate under legislation currently being considered by the Government. The proposal is just one of the numbers of options being considered by the Prime Minister in a bid to bolster the role of the father in UK society. It is thought by signing the birth certificate new fathers will feel an increased responsibility to their child. A Downing Street spokesman told The Telegraph: 'We are committed to ensuring that Government policy is family friendly and the Prime Minister has been clear previously that more should be done to ensure the role of fathers is recognised and strengthened.' At the moment only a mothers name has to be registered and if no man signs the certificate the father will be described as unknown. It is estimated that 50,000 babies are born without the father’s name being placed on the certificate. Earlier this year David Cameron likened runaway fathers to drink drivers. The concept was initially thought of when Labour were in power after being initiated by the left of centre Institute of Public Policy Research. Family unit: Currently 50,000 children are born in Britain every year without a father named on the birth certificate . It led to the requirement being made part of the 2009 Welfare Reform Act, which required mothers to name the father and also threatened them with a £200 fine and seven days in prison for perjury if they gave a false answer. They said naming the father would increase responsibility and also make it easier to make sure they accepted their full obligations, including financial support. But when the Coalition came into office it was decided against pressing with enforcement of the provision. The Department of Education said it had 'no plans' to introduce fresh legislation, although it was looking for ways to support fathers in the 'crucial role they play in their child’s life.'","Part of Cameron's plan to tackle runaway dads .

For a woman who claims she has just become a multimillionaire, Mirlande Wilson certainly did not show it when being interviewed about her alleged Mega Millions win. The 37-year-old McDonald's employee from Maryland spoke to NBC about buying the winning lotto ticket and remained defiant that it was her own rather than one of the pooled tickets with 15 of her coworkers. She said: 'I'm so scared, I'm so like this, I'm so shocked. I don't know whats going on.' When asked where the winning ticket was, the mother-of-seven remained coy and simply said: 'I cannot tell you.' Scroll down for video . Defiant: Mirlande Wilson spoke to the Today show about her winning Mega Millions ticket and still claims she bought it outside of the work pool . Baltimore: A crowd of people gathered outside Mirlande's home yesterday where she lives with her seven children as they tried to catch a glimpse of the alleged lotto winner . She claims she gave all of her coworkers the copies of the tickets for the pool and the winning ticket was not among them. Instead she claims to have sent a friend to buy more tickets later that day and the winning one was among them. 'McDonald's don't have nothing to do . with this,' she insisted. 'They don't have nothing to do with - they . don't even know about it and they don't even have nothing to do with . this. It's only us by ourself [sic].' Lottery executives said they cannot confirm who the lucky three ticket holders are in Maryland, Kansas and Illinois until they come forward. Ms Wilson has yet to produce a ticket, leaving Mega Millions officials skeptical. Stephen Martino, Maryland lottery . director, told ABC: 'We don't know any more than the public or media . does and it's all speculation and we're not going to get involved in . that.' Another official added: 'It's probably not this person.' Lucky winner? Mirlande Wilson, who says she bought the winning ticker with her own money rather than the pooled money with coworkers at McDonald's . Not lovin' it: Davon Wilson, left, and Suleman Ousman Husein - McDonald's workers who were in the Mega Millions pool with 13 colleagues, including Mirlande Wilson . Proof? Mirlande Wilson showed a reporter the copies of the pooled tickets she shared with her McDonald's employees and said the winning ticket was not among them - though would not say where it was . Winners in Maryland and Illinois have six months to claim the money - Kansas's newest multimillionaire has up to a year. Both Maryland and Kansas will allow winners to remain anonymous but the lucky ticket-holder in Illinois will be identified. Ms Wilson had enraged her co-workers . with claims of her scoop after she revealed to the New York Post that . she was not planning on sharing the millions - despite the fact they had . pooled their money for tickets. Workers at the fast food outlet bought a number of tickets together for the biggest lottery in world history but Ms Wilson claimed she separately bought one of the three winning tickets. 'We had a group plan, but I went and . played by myself. [The ‘winning’ ticket] wasn’t on the group plan,' Wilson told The New York Post. Waiting: Maryland Mega Millions boss Stephen Martino refused to speculate on those who claimed to have won until he saw evidence of a winning ticket . Celebration: The Milford store is proudly displaying that they sold one of the winning tickets though the person who bought it has yet to come forward . 'I was in the group, but this was . separate. The winning ticket was a separate ticket,' the single mother-of-seven said as she and her fiancé left her home. The . Haitian immigrant claimed she had hidden the . winning ticket and would present it to lottery officials yesterday. But later she started to backtrack saying she wasn't sure whether she had won or not. 'I don’t know if I won. Some of the numbers were familiar. I recognized some of them,' she said. 'I don’t know why people are saying differently. 'I’m going to go to the lottery office today. I bought some tickets separately.' With winning tickets also sold in Illinois and Kansas, a single Maryland winner would get an after-tax lump sum of $105 million, or $5.59 million a year for 26 years. Wilson’s co-workers - who make little more than $7.50 an hour - are furious at her claims she bought the winning ticket with her own money. 'She can’t do this to us!' said . Suleiman Osman Husein, a shift manager and one of 15 members in the . pool. 'We each paid $5. She took everybody’s money!' The . group’s tickets - along with a list of those who contributed to the . pool - were left in an office safe at the fast food outlet, said the . man, who gave only his first name, Allen, as he stood next to Layla. She . declined to comment. Then, late Friday, before the night’s . drawing, the owner of the McDonald’s, Birul Desai, gave Wilson $5 to . buy more tickets for the pool on her way home from work, and she went . back to the 7-Eleven and bought them, Allen said. Wilson took those tickets home with her, Allen said. Store: Wilson told the New York Post she stopped by the Milford Mill 7-Eleven after work to buy tickets for herself with a friend and not with the pooled money from work . According to the Post, when she found out she had the winning ticket, she called co-workers and told them she - rather than they - had won. 'I won! I won!' she told a colleague. McDonald's worker Davon Wilson said he was there when Wilson called. Three - Winners who matched six numbers . 1.5 billion - Dollars spent on Mega Millions tickets . 429 million - Dollars spent on tickets on Friday alone . 161 - Number of people who matched five numbers and won $250,000 . 897 - Number of people who matched four numbers and won $10,000 . 18 - Times the jackpot rolled without a winner, leading to Friday's record of $640 million . 12 million - Amount in dollars of this Tuesday's jackpot . 100 million - Americans who played Megamillions . 182 - Days the Maryland winner has to come forward . 365 - Days the Illinois and Kansas winners have to come forward . 20,000 - Times more likely to die in a car crash than win the lotto . 2,600 - Dollars worth of tickets one man bought in Arizona . 'She said, ""Turn on the news"". She said she had won. I thought it was a joke or something. She doesn’t seem like a person who’d do this,' he said. Allen told the Post he and Layla then went to Wilson's home to question her about the winning ticket. Though she first refused to come out, they banged on her door for 20 minutes until she finally relented. 'These people are going to kill you. It’s not worth your life!' Allen said he told her. 'All right! All right! I’ll share, but I can’t find the ticket right now,' she said, according to Allen. A clerk at the . 7-Eleven where Wilson bought the tickets said they believed it was a man . who had bought the winning ticket and doubted that Wilson's story was . actually true after lottery officials reviewed the . store’s CCTV footage. Carole Everett said they had no information about the Maryland winner and whether it was a man or a woman who bought the winning ticket. She said: 'Right now, everything is just speculation and gossip. 'Until someone comes through that door and hands over the winning ticket we will not know who the winner is.' If Wilson won, and if it was with a . pooled work ticket, the situation would be very similar to that of . New Jersey man Americo Lopes, who was sued by his former colleagues . after he claimed he was the sole winner of a $38.5 million Mega Millions . lottery jackpot. The five construction workers say . they and Lopes were members of a weekly lottery pool, each person . contributing $2 and Lopes would buy the tickets. He . claimed he played the lottery both by himself and as a member of the . pool and that the winning ticket in the November 2009 drawing was one he . bought for himself. Lopes chose the lump-sum payment option and received $24 million. A woman buys Mega Millions lottery tickets at a shop on New York City's upper west side of Manhattan .

In Illinois, the Chicago Tribune said a second jackpot winner, who also has yet to step forward, bought a quick-pick ticket at a gas station and convenience store in Red Bud, a community of about 3,700 in southwestern Illinois.

A schoolgirl who penned a guide to dealing with her mother's epilepsy is celebrating after becoming a published author - aged just seven. Talented Layla Reid wrote her 'Epilepsy Book for Kids' as a guide to help children cope with an epileptic parent's seizures, after witnessing her own mother's fits. Sarah Reid suffers from terrifying absence seizures, where she appears to be in a deep daydream. Literary star: Layla Reid, 7, with her Epilepsy Book for Kids, a guide to coping with a parent's epileptic seizures . When Layla showed her book to Bristol publisher John Adler, he was so impressed that he agreed to print it free of charge, and give her a share of the profits. The book is now on sale in major stores including Waterstones, priced at £6.50. The budding writer said of her work: 'I hope it helps some other children so that they know what to do if their mummy has a fit.' Mrs Reid, 31, has suffered from seizures since she was Layla's age, and couldn't be prouder of her daughter's initiative. She hopes the book will prove a valuable resource for children coping with a parent's epilepsy. She said: 'I'm so proud of her, I never thought in a million years it would be published. Couldn't be prouder! Mother Sarah Reid, 31, hopes her daughter's book will reassure and inform children . 'I always wanted to be a writer when I was younger, but it's just one of those things isn't it. 'I really hope she can help a lot of children and let them know they are not alone. 'It’s great to have her raising awareness and helping other kids. It could end up being a life-saver for someone. 'I think she has had to grow up quite quickly because of my epilepsy. She’s a clever girl. We’re so proud of her.' Educational: The book is written in Layla's handwriting, and in a simple, child-friendly style . Amazingly, the entire book was produced in just one evening. Written in Layla's handwriting, it includes straightforward tips that children can easily follow - such as moving dangerous objects out of the way if someone starts fitting. It also features her own illustrations. The guide came about after Mrs Reid tried and failed to find a child-friendly book which could explain epilepsy. Dreaming of the future: Layla says her next project will be a story about her baby sister, and the things they will do together when she's older . When she realised there was hardly any information for children, Layla came up with the idea of writing a guide for other kids - so they know what to do if they witness an epileptic fit. Self-confessed bookworm Layla plans to keep up her writing, and hopes this will be the first of many stories. The seven-year-old says her next venture will be a tale about her baby sister Lauren, who arrived five weeks ago. 'I’m very happy to have a new sister, and I’m very proud,' she said. 'I want to write a story about all the things we’ll do together for when she’s older.' Layla's teachers have noticed a . massive improvement in her writing and enthusiasm for schoolwork since . she wrote the Epilepsy Book for Kids. 'We hope she’ll encourage some other children in her class to start writing too,' her mother said. Young though she is, Layla has already set her heart on a career in education.

Television history was made yesterday as cameras were allowed into court to film the moment a murderer was sentenced to life in prison. It was the first time that cameras had recorded the sentencing of a killer in a British court. But the cameraman was not permitted to film murderer David Gilroy himself, who was convicted last month of killing his ex-lover Suzanne Pilley. Scroll down to watch the televised sentencing . Days from death: The CCTV image shows Suzanne Pilley shopping with murderer David Gilroy in 2010. Within 48 hours she had died at his hand . Instead, the footage focused solely on the judge, Lord Bracadale, as he handed Gilroy a mandatory life sentence. A single television camera, set up in the empty jury box, recorded his statement. At the High Court in Edinburgh he told Gilroy, whose victim’s body has . not been found: ‘It seems that you are the only person who knows where . her body is. ‘I hope that a day will come in your life when you will feel able to . disclose that information and that might bring some comfort to her . bereft family.’ The historic move to allow the recording was the result of a successful . application by Scottish broadcaster STV, which argued it would be in the . public interest. Legal history: Gilroy's sentencing at the High Court in Edinburgh today was the first to be televised in Britain. Cameras focussed on Lord Bracadale. The defendant was not allowed to be filmed . Marker: There are plans for more cases from British courtrooms to be televised . Filming is currently banned in criminal court hearings in England and . Wales, though this ban is expected to be lifted later this year . following an announcement in the Queen’s Speech in May. Hearings at Westminster’s Supreme Court, the UK’s highest court, are . already broadcast live and cameras have been allowed in Scottish courts . since 1992. But their presence has been very rare – restricted to a few high-profile . appeal court cases, including that of Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset . al-Megrahi in 2002. Before yesterday’s sentencing, the court had heard . that Miss Pilley, 38, a respected and well-liked book-keeper from . Edinburgh, ‘just disappeared’ after making her way to the city centre . office she shared with Gilroy on May 4, 2010. Guilty: Gilroy (left) was last month convicted of murdering his former lover Miss . Pilley (right) Jealous Gilroy, 49, confronted her before she reached her desk about her . decision to end their relationship, then snapped and killed her. The ‘deceitful and controlling’ killer maintained a front of normality, . then drove her body to a secret grave, believed to be in remote Argyll. Lord Bracadale told Gilroy: ‘The evidence indicated that, having . confronted her over her decision to end the relationship, you lost your . temper and murdered her in a sustained attack.’ Unable to grieve properly: Miss Pilley's parents, Sylvia and Robert (above), arrive at court for sentencing this morning. They have pleaded with Gilroy to reveal where their daughter's body is buried . The judge added: ‘The evidence showed that after murdering Suzanne . Pilley, you immediately embarked on an elaborate plan to dispose of her . body and avoid detection. With quite chilling calmness and calculation, . you successfully disposed of the body, apparently somewhere in Argyll.’ Gilroy, who maintains his innocence, showed no emotion as he was led away amid angry shouts from the packed courtroom. Miss Pilley’s parents, Sylvia and Rob, who attended court, said that . although they were comforted to know justice had been done, they would . not be able to rest completely until they knew where their ‘devoted’ daughter was.

A despairing Nicolas Sarkozy was bracing himself for a crushing end to his political career today as campaigning closed in the French presidential election. Showing the signs of strain in the . closely run French election, president Nicolas Sarkozy yesterday . admitted that he might be defeated when voters go to the polls on . Sunday. The political leader, who has been . desperately trying to hang on in a political race with his main rival . Francois Hollande, indicated that he was already looking at a life . outside the political arena. Feeling the pressure: Nicolas Sarkozy delivers a speech during a final campaign meeting before the second round of the French presidential elections on Sunday. He has admitted that his party may be defeated . Popular candidate: Socialist Party leader Francois Hollande is the favourite to triumph in Sunday's French elections, with most pundits saying only a major upset could scupper his chances . Hanging on: Despite large rallies like the one in Toulon yesterday, Mr Sarkozy has admitted that he could be facing defeat after only one five-year term as French president . He . was quoted in The Times today as saying: 'I think we can win, but if . the French people decide otherwise, that is their right. At that moment . another life starts.' But, where Mr Sarkozy might appear . resigned to his fate, Mr Hollande said he could not rule out the . possibility of defeat as well, given Mr Sarkozy’s background as a wily . political campaigner. Mr Hollande said: ‘The polls are . there, and they show a closing of the gap. So I say to all those who . want me to be the next president, don’t let others decide in your . place.' Polls suggested that the 57-year-old was due to be rejected after a single term, so allowing Francois Hollande to take power. Question time: Francois Hollande (left) and Nicolas Sarkozy (right) with journalists Laurence Ferrari and David Pujadas during the televised debate . Rivals: Francois Hollande (left) and Nicolas Sarkozy (right) tried to wow voters by setting out their policies . Contented: Supporters of Socialist Party candidate Francois Hollande react as they watch his televised debate in Marseille . Mr Hollande, also 57, would become . France’s first Socialist president if he wins the second round of the . bitterly fought election on Sunday. Final polls suggest that Mr . Hollande’s lead has narrowed to as low as five per cent from 10 per . cent, but Mr Sarkozy came second in the first round and other party . chiefs have failed to back him. National Front leader Marine Le Pen . told her six million plus supporters to ‘vote blank’, while centrist . party head Francois Bayrou said he would vote for Mr Hollande. Two top French TV networks say at least 19.5 million people - about a third of France's population - tuned in to a spirited debate between President Nicolas Sarkozy and Socialist Francois Hollande.French newspapers on Thursday generally described the debate the previous night as brisk, even aggressive, between the candidates who square off in Sunday's race finale.Sarkozy - the conservative incumbent - failed to land a knockout blow against Hollande, who has led polls for months.Joint debate presenters TF1 and France-2 TV reported a peak audience of 19.5 million viewers.Audience tracker Mediametrie says 20 million people tuned in to the 2007 debate between Sarkozy and Socialist Segolene Royal. Mr Sarkozy’s best hope of being . re-elected involved winning the support of around 80 per cent of Ms Le . Pen’s votes and at least half of Mr Bayrou's. But Mr Bayrou, who came fifth in the . first round with nine per cent of the vote, attacked Mr Sarkozy’s . increasingly extreme pledges on immigration and Europe. Mr Sarkozy has been desperately . trying to win over National Front supporters, saying that there are ‘too . many immigrants in France’ and that they are not being integrated . properly. Branding Mr Sarkozy an extremist, Mr . Bayrou said: ‘The line Nicolas Sarkozy chose between the two rounds is . violent. It contradicts our values.’ Today Mr Sarkozy said that Mr . Hollande ‘would lead the country to bankruptcy’, and has frequently . accused his Socialist rival of being ‘a liar’, including during a live . TV debate on Wednesday. But Mr Hollande said he could not . rule out the possibility of not winning, given Sarkozy’s background as a . wily political campaigner. He said: ‘Where [Sarkozy] made a mistake is that he underestimated me,.' Mr Hollande told RTL radio, adding: . ‘In politics, he who underestimates is too confident in himself and . shows a lack of judgment.’ Defeat for Sarkozy will mean he will . become the first president since Valery Giscard d'Estaing in 1981 to . fail in a re-election bid. Mr Hollande, in turn, will become the first Socialist president of France since Francois Mitterand retired in 1995. Turn out: Nicolas Sarkozy's wife Carla Bruni (left) and former presidential socialist candidate Segolene Royal (right) were present behind the scenes at the debate . Mr Hollande has promised a . wide-ranging left-wing programme, including a top tax rate of 75 per . cent and the creation of thousands of new public sector jobs, including . 60,000 new teachers. He said he ‘dislikes the rich’ and had already singled out ‘the world of finance’ as his principal enemy. A Hollande win is likely to see a . huge influx of wealthy French people into the UK, as those who fear . sky-high taxes leave their own country. Support: The debate ¿ broadcast on France's two main terrestrial channels and on satellite news ¿ was expected to be watched by more than half of the country's 44.5 million voters . Estate agents in London are already reporting increased interest in properties from clients from the other side of the Channel. The final polls by Ipsos and BVA . today suggested that Mr Hollande’s lead had narrowed by one point, with . 52.5 per cent support compared Mr Sarkozy's 47.5 per cent. Surveys by CSA and Harris Interactive showed Mr Hollande’s lead at 53 per cent support to Sarkozy's 47 per cent. Voting in the election begins in . France’s overseas territories on Saturday, and in mainland France on . Sunday. The results of official exit polls should be available by Sunday . evening.

Road to recovery: Lyam Baker, 15, has finally been diagnosed with Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome - a physical condition that causes sufferers to vomit several times a day . A teenager who used to vomit up to 15 times a day, spent six months on a psychiatric ward before her mother finally convinced doctors she had a physical condition, rather than a eating disorder. Lyam Baker, 15, shrank from a healthy size 12 to a size zero within months after developing Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome - a physical condition that causes sufferers to vomit several times a day. But medics believed the teen was purposely making herself sick - and held her on a mental health ward for months before her mother finally convinced them she was suffering from CVS. The condition caused Lyam, from Birmingham, West Midlands, to vomit up to 15 times a day - and at her worst, she weighed just six and a half stone. Her mum, Carol, a nurse, desperately tried to convince doctors that her daughter was not suffering from an eating disorder . But medics didn’t realise that Lyam was actually suffering from the rare condition, which started after she got scared on a school camping trip. Ms Baker said: 'Lyam’s illness very quickly took over our lives. 'Her vomiting cycles were furious and frequent and she spiralled downwards quickly, and her weight declined rapidly. 'She went from being a bright, bubbly . girl, to constantly being exhausted and a shell of her former self- it . is a very lonely illness. 'I . painfully watched my daughter withering away while the doctors kept . insisting she was doing this to herself - she said she wasn’t and I . believed her. 'I had to fight and fight to get the doctors to listen to me - I don’t want any other family to have to go through what I did.' Weight loss: Lyam, shrank from a size 12 to a size zero within months - she missed almost two years of school with sickness episodes, which can be triggered by feelings of stress or excitement, occurring on an almost weekly basis . Painful memories: Lyam's backbone protrudes in this photo taken when she was gravely ill - she is now slowly putting on weight and back at school . Onset: Lyam first developed the condition following a school camping trip when she was 13 - after worrying that teachers would leave the pupils alone . Lyam first developed the condition following a school camping trip when she was 13 - after worrying that teachers would leave the pupils alone. She got so stressed that she started . vomiting - and for the next 18 months, continued to suffer horrendous . vomiting episodes that could last for up to five days - where she would . be sick up to 80 times in a week. The . condition meant that bright Lyam missed almost two years of school with . sickness episodes, which can be triggered by feelings of stress or . excitement, occurring on an almost weekly basis. Ms Baker said: 'Every time Lyam had another episode, she would be admitted to hospital for a few days and then discharged. 'Everyone . kept telling me it was a psychiatric issue, but I could see that it . wasn’t. The consultant called in the mental health team and eventually . admitted her to a psychiatric unit. 'While Lyam was there, staff would take away her vomit bowl, and even hold her against the wall in a bid to break the cycle. 'There . had been a brief mention of CVS when Lyam first started being sick - . but doctors seemed to totally disregard it for months. 'I . was so worried they would never discover what was wrong with her, I . used to cry myself to sleep at night. I thought I was going to end up . planning her funeral.' CVS is characterised by recurrent, prolonged attacks of severe vomiting, nausea and lethargy, with no apparent cause. Vomiting persists at frequent intervals, 5-6 times per hour at the peak, for periods ranging from hours to10 days or more. It most commonly lasts for between 1 and 4 days and the sufferer is generally in good health between episodes. There is no diagnostic clinical or laboratory tests for CVS itself - it can be diagnosed when other condition have been eliminated. Who gets CVS?It is thought that anyone can potentially get CVS. Sufferers are more likely than average to have a family history of migraine, and/or travel sickness sometimes.What triggers a vomiting episode?For many with CVS there is nothing obvious that starts an attack, for others some specific 'triggers' can be identified which may initiate a CVS episode. Physical stress is one of the most common triggers. Going without food for too long and sleep deprivation can also act as physical triggers. When does it start?The onset of CVS can occur from infancy to adulthood. It most commonly develops between the age of 3-7 years and it can persist from months to decades. It affects males and females equally. Source: cvsa.com . It . was only after almost 12 months on the ward that specialists eventually . realised that there was something physically wrong with Lyam - and were . able to give her medication in a bid to control the vomiting. Ms Baker added: 'Lyam’s symptoms have subsided recently - she now hasn’t had an attack for a few months. 'She is slowly putting on weight again, and is able to go back to school. 'I am finally getting my daughter back. It’s very painful to talk about, but I need people to be more aware of CVS. 'We . don’t know exactly why her condition has improved suddenly, it could . just be a hormonal balance - but we’re hoping she won’t have to suffer . again. 'We need people, . and medical professionals especially, to be more aware of this . condition and hopefully sufferers will be able to be diagnosed more . easily. 'I don’t want any other family to go through what we have done.' Dr Robin Dover, from the Cyclical . Vomiting Syndrome Association, said: 'No-one really knows for sure what . causes CVS, although in the last couple of years, there has been . research carried out which suggests it may be caused by genetic changes . that can be inherited. 'It’s . difficult to say how many people suffer from the condition, because . diagnosis is so complicated and many people are never properly . diagnosed. 'However, . studies carried out in Australia and the UK suggest that somewhere . between 0.1  and two per cent of the population can be affected at some . point in their lives. 'There . are no tests to diagnose CVS, and therefore it is always a case of . eliminating every other possible cause of sickness before a diagnosis . can be made. 'Similar symptoms of vomiting can be caused by a range of problems from a brain tumour to kidney abnormalities. 'But . often the most hurtful thing that happens is that patients are told . that they have mental health issues - it can be torturous for the . sufferers and their families, and often ends up delaying a proper . diagnosis.' Brighter future: Lyam and her mother Carol: 'I am finally getting my daughter back. It's very painful to talk about, but I need people to be more aware of CVS,' said Lyam's mother .","Lyam Baker, 15, suffers from Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome - a physical condition that causes sufferers to vomit several times a day .

Shock: Max Taylor, the son of the Governor of the Cayman Islands says finding out he was a father was a shock he was not ready for . When distinguished diplomat Duncan Taylor became the Governor of the Cayman Islands, he promised that his family would strive to get to know the locals. Two years later his 25-year-old son Max has rather exceeded those expectations by fathering a child after a brief liaison with the daughter of a prominent local businessman. Their daughter, Serenity, was born seven months ago. However, the relationship between Max, a £7-an-hour hotel swimming pool attendant, and the baby’s mother, Sophia Rankin, has grown increasingly rancorous and now threatens to set tongues wagging in this slow-moving British overseas territory and tax haven. Yesterday, as he stood on the steps of the imposing white-washed Government House, where he lives with his parents, Max said he felt ‘intimidated’ by Ms Rankin. He claimed she had been making threatening late-night phone calls, accusing him of shirking his responsibilities. ‘I hope it doesn’t cause trouble for my father,’ he said. ‘The last year has been the worst of my life. I wasn’t ready to be a father and I am not with the mother. ‘What happened – the pregnancy – was an accident. It wasn’t planned and was a shock.’ It must also have been a shock for the . Governor, who was honoured by the Queen with a CBE for his work at the . British Consulate in New York in the aftermath of the attacks on . September 11. Seven Mile Beach: Diplomat Duncan Taylor moved to the Cayman Islands to become governor before his son Max got a local woman pregnant . His family has a long record of public service. His father, Sir Jock, was ambassador to West Germany while his grandfather,  Sir John, capped his 50-year diplomatic career as ambassador to  Mexico in the Fifties. Duncan Taylor, 53, helps his son by contributing to monthly child-support payments and has seen Serenity on a ‘few occasions’. Max, who works at the Ritz-Carlton hotel, said: ‘I do not earn a lot of money and so my father helps out. We pay what we think is a fair amount. Island intrigue: Cayman Islands . Governor Duncan Taylor after his swearing-in ceremony back in January 2010 . 'I am not aware of any problems but there is not really a good relationship with the mother. ‘My father gets on well with Sophia’s father, but she has been very intimidating and calling me in the early hours of the morning and sending me texts. ‘She has been quite threatening, even though I am doing all I can to support our daughter. I have seen Serenity two or three times, but hopefully that will increase.’ The Governor’s mansion is set in an acre of manicured lawns on the edge of Grand Cayman’s Seven Mile Beach, a stunning stretch of white sand that has been voted the best beach in the Caribbean. Its grand foyer is dominated by a painting of the Queen. An antique table at the entrance is covered with photographs of dignitaries who have visited in recent years, including Prince Andrew, Tony Blair and the Duke of Kent. The residence is on the opposite side of the island from where Ms Rankin, 28, an accountant, lives with her parents, Kent and Ella, in a modern red-brick house in the  Bodden Town area. Ms Rankin became pregnant after she met Max at a New Year’s Eve Party in 2010. Friends said they were not dating and the pregnancy was a ‘shock’ to both. Ms Rankin said Max was not present at the birth and had not been involved with bringing up their daughter. But she insisted he was able to see Serenity whenever he wanted. ‘He has seen her a few times and any time he wants to see her again he can call,’ she said. ‘Max and I are not together. It never worked out between us and he does not live with me and the baby. 'I have not seen him for some time, but all he has to do is call, although I have a very busy schedule. I am working as an accountant so am away from home during the day. Pool attendant: The lavish swimming pool at the Ritz Carlton, Grand Cayman, where Governor Duncan Taylor's son Max works . ‘I would say I have a very good relationship with the Taylors and they have a good relationship with the baby. There is no animosity.’ Ms Rankin said if she needed money to help buy clothes she just had to ask the Taylor family. ‘They have said that anything I need I should buy. Max is supporting his child,’ she said. She would not talk about her father’s relationship with Governor Taylor or what he thought about Max. Mr Rankin owns numerous properties on Grand Cayman, including a shopping centre and three restaurants as well as the local radio station. Earlier this year he was made a Commander of the Cayman Islands for his contribution to Grand Cayman. Mr Rankin, who is also known by his nickname ‘Biggie’, declined to talk about his daughter and the Governor’s son when contacted. Mr Taylor is halfway through a four-year posting as the 11th Cayman Islands Governor. In a statement to The Mail on Sunday, he said: ‘While my son and the child’s mother are no longer partners, he is helping to support the child. We are in close contact with the Rankin family. ‘We are delighted to have a wonderful and beautiful granddaughter and enjoy spending time with her tremendously. She brings joy to both our families.’ A Foreign Office spokesman added that it was untrue that there was any animosity between the families.","Duncan Taylor's son Max calls pregnancy an 'accident' 'unplanned' and 'a shock'

A one-of-a-kind Aston Martin, built especially to cater to a Scottish laird's passion for fishing, is going on sale next week. The wealthy landowner commissioned the renowned British car company to make a special model of his favourite car so that it could accommodate his piscatorial tools. The result was the only Aston Martin DBS Estate in existence. The unique car has a bigger back and carried many a sizeable salmon catch during its years of service to the former unnamed owner. Coach-builders at the prestigious British car makers knocked up the only Aston Martin DBS Estate in existence . He bought the then ruby vehicle in 1971 and used it for fishing trips in the Scottish Highlands until he sold the extended automatic car in 1975 to the latest recipient, who is now selling it at auction after 36 years. The current, elderly vendor, from north-east England, had the Aston Martin sprayed blue and used it as a second car for family holidays and days out. Despite its age, the motor has only done 70,000 miles and passed its MoT with flying colours just two weeks ago. The current owner painted the red car and is now selling it after 36 years of faithful service as a leisure mobile . The boot of the car was enlarged to fit both the equipment and the catch and carried many a salmon caught by the Scottish gentry man . From the Scottish Highlands to Buckinghamshire: The DBS Estate has travelled a long way in its 41 years . The car is being sold by auctioneers Bonhams with a pre-sale estimate of £70,000. Tim Schofield, director of Bonhams' Motor Car department, said: 'This is a true one-off car that was commissioned for practical purposes. 'It has been with the current owner for the majority of its life. I think he is a man of advancing years and he has had his fun out of it and it is now time to pass it on to somebody else.' What it normally looked like: The 55th Motor Show at Earls Court in 1970, showcasing an Aston Martin DBS V8 with models Jenny Lowe (L) and Carol Craig sitting on the bonnet . 'It has always been used as a second car in the household for high days and holidays.' Mr Schofield added: 'Looking at it head on, it looks just like a six cylinder Aston Martin DBS and it is only when you look at it side on and from the rear you see it looks totally different.' 'The car has still retained its famous ""Coke bottle"" wing line shape and is seamless in appearance. 'The car was ordered new by a Scottish laird who wanted a car to use for fishing trips that could accommodate his fishing gear and with a bit of luck a sizeable catch' 'He had a leaping salmon mascot fixed to the bonnet but that is sadly long gone.' Aston Martin converted numerous DB5 and DB6 chassis into estate cars but this one is the only DBS Estate in the world. Inside, the tan leather seats at the back fold flat to create a huge space for luggage. The auction takes place in Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, on May 19. Handy: The roof rack was used by the first owner to keep all the fishing gear in place during many visits to the coast to catch fish .

An Australian backpacker has been hired as a nanny by David and Samantha Cameron after a series of long distance interviews over the internet. Sammi Strange, 24, has limited professional experience of looking after children having previously worked as an advertising sales assistant for a Melbourne television channel. But she charmed the Prime Minister and his wife during chats on Skype and has now been trusted with their three children Nancy, eight, Arthur, six, and Florence, 20 months. The Camerons enjoy a day out at the Harvest food and music festival in Oxfordshire last September with their children Nancy (left), baby Florence and Arthur . Miss Strange, the daughter of a pub owner, was first identified in the Australian press earlier this week. She is believed to have already started the role and will be in Downing . Street for six weeks while the Camerons' permanent nanny, Nepalese Gita . Lama, is on leave. Mr and Mrs Cameron were so impressed by Miss Strange . they were able to laugh off an internet survey she had completed as a . teenager where she admitted shoplifting, smoking and drinking. In the survey on a social networking website the former Melbourne . Grammar School pupil denied taking drugs ‘in the last month’ and when . asked if she swears she replied: 'F*** yeah'. Asked to declare the number of drugs she had taken, she replied: 'No comment'. Miss Sammy said her first thought in the morning was that she did not . want to get up and her top achievement would be to finish university . that year without dropping out. The survey also revealed she loves . eating sushi, longs to visit Europe, that her dream job was to be an . events manager, her weakness is maths and her biggest fear is sharks. Miss Strange decided to leave her former  job to go travelling last . month. Before setting off she registered for a nanny agency,  where Mr . and Mrs Cameron found her CV. Eligible batchelor: Miss Strange's father hopes his daughter gets to meet Prince Harry, pictured with Lady Louise Windsor at his brother's wedding last year .

Her father David Strange, a former vice-president of an Australian Rules . football club, said his daughter was enjoying her new job but was . concerned about the publicity it attracts. He said: 'It’s all blown up a . bit. She is very worried about it.' Mr Strange said he had given her an Australian Rules football to give . as a gift to the Camerons' children to help induct them into his . nation’s culture. The former vice-president of St Kilda Football Club . said: 'She was shaking when she found out who it was. She was very . excited and nervous. 'I hope she might marry Prince Harry but I couldn’t afford the wedding.'

New charge: Joshua Graham Packer, 22, is now charged with sexual assault; he also faces the death penalty if convicted of two murders . A new count of sexual assault has been added to charges against a 22-year-old man facing trial in the stabbing deaths of an affluent couple and their unborn child in their multi-million-dollar Southern California beach house. Joshua Graham Packer was indicted last week by a grand jury for forcing a pregnant Davina Husted to perform a sex act on him before she was stabbed to death. Packer is facing a death penalty trial on accusations that he killed Brock and Davina Husted and their unborn child inside their Faria Beach home on May 20, 2009. Packer appeared in court Monday on the latest indictment, but arraignment was postponed until May 16. The prosecutor and defence lawyer wouldn't comment. The case has sparked national interest, in part because Ventura County, California – otherwise known as the Gold Coast – is one of the safest neighbourhoods in the country. Mr and Mrs Husted, both 42, were stabbed to death at their beachfront home the night of May 20, 2009, after an armed man wearing a motorcycle mask burst through the unlocked double doors in the front of the beach house. According to the indictment, Packer forced Mrs Husted to perform oral sex on him before he allegedly stabbed her. Police arrested Packer nearly a year later in conjunction to the crimes.

Moment of grief: Pallbearers carry the coffins of the couple out at the funeral in 2009 . Packer, who pleaded not guilty to the crimes, faces the death penalty if convicted, but can also be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, the Ventura County Star said. Scene photos following the gruesome murders show a community struck by shock and grief. The Star reported that both the husband and wife had been stabbed multiple times – Mr Husted was stabbed more than 20 times, and his wife, more than 30. The murders were witnessed by their then-nine-year-old son, who had ran to get cash from his mother’s purse to give to the armed intruder. But when he returned, the man was stabbing his parents with a kitchen knife in the bedroom, according to search warrants in the triple murder case released in 2010. The couple's son told sheriff's detectives he helped his parents get cash from their wallets to give to the man wearing a black motorcycle helmet. Booming business: Mr Hustead, centre left, ran a wrought-iron business called Custom Couture, which afforded he and his wife, centre right, a very comfortable lifestyle . Gold Coast: The family lived in this beach house, which was later listed for $3.2million; Packer allegedly entered through the unlocked door, right . He also said his parents made the robber promise not to hurt him or his 11-year-old sister, who was sleeping, and the man agreed. The boy said his parents ran toward their bedroom and the intruder followed. He heard his mother scream, then hid behind the living room couch until the man left. The boy woke his sister and together, they checked on their parents' bodies. The children then locked the bedroom door and escaped through a window to a neighbour’s home. DNA evidence links Packer to Mrs Husted, and more of his DNA was found under Mr Husted’s fingernails. Seemingly safe: The Husteads lived in an exclusive gated community that had an active neighbourhood watch program; here, police block off the crime scene . Hunting for clues: Crime scene investigators found Packer's DNA at the scene . The couple married in 1995. Mr Husted ran a custom-design wrought iron shop that catered to high-end clients, an extremely lucrative business. Mel Gibson and Oprah Winfrey were some of his clients, according to NBC's Dateline. Mrs Husted, a former Miss California contestant, was expecting her third child in the fall of 2009. The couple were planning on naming the child Grant. Mr Husted’s brother Scott told NBC’s Dateline in 2010 that the murders were baffling. ‘There’s no obvious reason why this family would have drawn a killer to them at 10:30 in the evening, while they’re watching American Idol,’ he said.

A former detective was arrested yesterday for allegedly stabbing his hairdresser wife to death in her salon. Natalie Esack, in her 30s, is thought to have left her husband of eight years Ivan Esack around a month ago, taking her pets with her as she moved out. Staff at neighbouring businesses said they heard a terrifying scream ring out from her shop yesterday morning and saw two other hairdressers running into the street. Dramatic tale: Natalie Esack, left, was found covered in stab wounds at her salon this morning, an hour before police arrested her estranged husband Ivan, right . A knife was recovered from the scene in the High Street in Ashford, Kent, and her ex-partner, now a football agent, was later arrested at the couple’s former three-bedroomed home a few miles away. Neighbours there said Mrs Esack had last been seen around a month ago, and had taken her pet cats and dog with her when she left. Last night her 38-year-old husband was in custody and being questioned by detectives from Kent Police – the force he left two years ago to set himself up as a football agent. A neighbour of the couple, who would not give her name, said: ‘I met them both at a Neighbourhood Watch street party last summer. She was quiet but he was more outgoing and talkative. ‘They seemed a pleasant couple. He told me he wanted to be more involved in politics and become a councillor.’ Charles Goodwin, 49, a mortgage broker who runs a business in an office three doors along from Esack Hair and Beauty, said he had waved to Mrs Esack earlier on the morning of her death – and had known the couple since arranging their joint mortgage eight years ago. He said: ‘I heard a scream, a loud scream, this morning. I thought it was just kids messing about. ‘It was only when I saw three police cars and an ambulance pull up here that I knew something was wrong. Shocking violence: Police launched an investigation after finding the seriously injured woman at the salon at 9.40am . ‘The police put a cordon up around the shop and then all the girls who work there came out of the shop. The only person who didn’t come out was Natalie. It’s just so, so sad.’ He said Mrs Esack was a ‘really lovely bubbly character’. Mrs Esack had several high-profile clients.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 15:14 EST, 4 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 15:36 EST, 4 May 2012 . A political adviser was told to 'go f*** himself' when he warned former Senator John Edwards that pursuing an extramarital affair with a videographer would sink his presidential ambitions, it was revealed today. Peter Scher, who first worked with Edwards when he was the Democrats' 2004 vice presidential nominee, testified at Edwards' campaign finance trial on Friday. He said the politician denied having a sexual relationship with Rielle Hunter when Scher broached the subject in September 2006. 'I told him if it was true that he was having an affair with Ms Hunter, he should not run for president,' Mr Scher testified as the second week of Edwards' trial neared its end. 'If it was true, eventually it would come out and it would destroy his political career.' Disillusioned: John Edwards arrives at the federal courthouse today to hear Bunny Mellon's confidant Bryan Huffman testify about how the heiress felt used by him . Confidant: Bryan Huffman, an interior decorator from Monroe, told the court today that Bunny Mellon was 'apoplectic' when Andrew Young asked her for $50m on behalf of Edwards . Mr Scher said he again confronted . Edwards about the affair in a heated phone call after learning Hunter . was still traveling with the former senator from North Carolina despite . staff concerns. This time, Edwards responded that he didn't need a babysitter and told Scher to back off, the former adviser recalled. 'He told me to go f*** myself,' said Mr Scher, who stopped serving as an outside adviser to Edwards at that point. Earlier today, a friend of the . 101-year-old heiress whose money helped hide John Edwards' pregnant . mistress said the presidential candidate should have used his own money . for the cover up and was 'apoplectic' when asked for $50million towards a . poverty foundation. Interior designer Bryan Huffman was . asked on the witness stand today how Rachel 'Bunny' Mellon reacted after . learning what became of some of the $725,000 in secret checks she had . funneled to a fundraiser for Edwards' 2008 campaign. Huffman, . 48, said that Mellon was not one to judge someone for having an . extramarital affair. Her relationship with her first husband overlapped . with that of her second. But, Huffman said, Mellon had an opinion about how her money was spent. 'She thought maybe you should probably pay for your girlfriend yourself,' Huffman replied. As the courtroom erupted in laughter, even the former North Carolina senator seated at the defense table cracked a smile. It was a frequent reaction to testimony from Huffman, the congenial Charlotte designer who described himself as the elderly millionaire's 'evening friend' — someone she calls for a chat before bedtime. Mellon, who rarely leaves her expansive Virginia estate, is not expected to testify at Edwards' corruption trial. But her money is at the heart of the government's case against Edwards. Prosecutors allege that he masterminded a scheme to use about $1 million from Mellon and a second wealthy supporter to hide his pregnant mistress as he sought the White House. Edwards denies knowing about the money and has pleaded not guilty to six criminal counts related to campaign finance violations. If convicted, he faces up to 30 years in prison. Benefactor: Paul and Bunny Mellon stand with . horse sculpture at Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond, Virginia, . circa 1987. Bunny is now blind and a recluse . Former Senator: John Edwards and his parents, mother Bobbie Edwards, left, and father Wallace Edwards arrive at the Federal Courthouse in Greensboro, North Carolina, today . Day two: Yesterday Huffman told the court that Bunny Mellon was in love with John Edwards and helping him on his campaign gave her a reason to live . In addition to the $725,000 at issue in the trial, Mellon gave an additional $6.4 million to organizations supportive of Edwards' presidential bid. Dogged by tabloid reports about his affair, Edwards was forced to withdraw from the race in January 2008. In the following months, it also became clear he also wouldn't be the Democratic nominee for vice president, as he had been four years earlier. According to earlier testimony, Edwards then turned his attention to raising money for a foundation to fight poverty. Andrew Young, the Edwards aide who helped carry out the cover-up of the mistress and her baby, called Mellon in the summer of 2008 and asked for another $40 to $50 million to endow the foundation. Young also discussed the feasibility of the donation with Mellon's financial adviser. Better: Edwards was joined by his eldest . daughter Cate as they headed into the trial on Thursday, just one day . after she left the court in tears . Possible defence witness: Rielle Hunter, the . former mistress of John Edwards, enters the federal courthouse in . Raleigh, North Carolina, Thursday, August 6, 2009 with the pair's child . Frances Quinn Hunter . Huffman, who had sent Mellon's secret checks to Young, said the heiress reacted angrily to the request, which she believed would have required her to liquidate some of her financial holdings. 'She was rather apoplectic at the size of the figure they requested. She was really upset,' Huffman testified. 'She said, ""I cannot believe that the senator really wanted me for my money all along"".' Huffman testified that he called Young and told him Mellon was deeply offended and that Edwards needed to smooth things over. The former senator apologized to her and said that he didn't know how much money Young had asked for, Huffman said. When the interior designer relayed that information to Young, the aide laughed and reiterated that the amount was Edwards' idea. 'He said ""Just call me throw-me-under-the-bus-Andrew"",' Huffman said. Huffman also testified that he felt that Young was being truthful. 'Everything he told me had been accurate, so my opinion was that he had told us the truth,' Huffman said. Bryan Huffman testifying about Andrew Young today . The previous day, Huffman testified that he'd participated in a scheme by Mellon to provide $725,000 in checks for Edwards. The . checks were written to Huffman with notations such as 'Antique . Charleston Table' in the memo line, and Huffman would endorse them and . pass them along to Young. The . ruse was intended to throw off money managers for the Mellon family by . making it appear they were engaged in a furniture business. The elderly heiress whose money and . how it was spent is the main focus of the John Edwards trial had a huge . crush on him and would be 'euphoric' whenever the former senator was . around, a friend testified. Jealous? Huffman said yesterday Bunny hated Elizabeth and would never allow her to come to her estate with Edwards . He also reiterated what other witnesses said about the now 101-year-old millionaire: 'She liked how he looked, what he espoused and what good he could do for the country.' She first met Edwards in 2004 and was said to have been in love with him ever since. The 48-year-old recounted what Bunny said after a December 2005 meeting with Edwards at her 4,000-acre estate: 'There goes the next president of the United States.' He testified that she was more than happy to pay for personal expenses for Edwards after the controversy about his expensive haircut in 2007. 'The campaign gave [Mellon] a wonderful focus and something to hold on to,' Mr Huffman said. Every phone call from Edwards 'always made her extremely happy'. 'She was having fun with this,' he added. But there was one thing clear about Edwards' visits to her sprawling estate - he was not allowed to bring his wife Elizabeth, who Mr Huffman said she hated. 'Unless Mrs Edwards could come then Mr Edwards couldn’t come,' Huffman recalled. The now blind and reclusive Bunny told Newsweek in an interview last year: 'John had a hard time with Elizabeth.' Her lawyer Alex Forger added his client 'was not enamored of his wife and didn’t want his wife to know that he was getting money.' Mellon's personal lawyer, Alex Forger, is expected to take the stand Friday afternoon.","Aide Peter Scher warned Edwards not to run for president if he was having an affair with Rielle Hunter .

One of Britain's most powerful businesswomen has infuriated residents with plans to erect two large wind turbines - which will be a 'blot on the landscape' whilst hidden from her own view. Dame Marjorie Scardino, the American-born chief of book publisher Pearson Plc, wants to build the two turbines in the grounds of her £2.5m country pile in Levington, near Ipswich, Suffolk. But while Texan Dame Marjorie, the highest paid female director of a FTSE 100 company, wants the turbines to minimise the carbon footprint in the area, the two giant structures will conveniently not be visible from her property, villagers have claimed. 'Blot on the landscape': A picture taken from a neighbouring house in Levington, Suffolk, shows the proposed site for the two turbines following a second application by the Scardinos . Instead, residents in Levington, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, say the two turbines, one of which could be 85ft tall, will be an eyesore for the rest of the small Suffolk village. The white turbines will be around 300ft from the nearest neighbours in Levington but almost 1,000ft from the Scardinos, according to the Daily Telegraph. Suffolk Coastal District council documents show that Dame Marjorie and her husband, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Albert Scardino, have already had one planning application for the turbines turned down last summer. Their previous request in July last year for two steel mast 20kw turbines measuring 27.1m (89ft) was withdrawn after objections from residents. Powerful: Dame Marjorie Scardino, millionaire boss of book publisher Pearson PLC, wants to erect two wind turbines near her Suffolk home, which is an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (file picture) Villagers have again objected to renewed plans by the Scardinos after arguing that the turbines will devalue house prices in Levington and the surrounding area, as well as being an eyesore in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Residents have expressed concerns that the Scardinos, who bought the countryside property seven years ago but live mostly in London, are 'riding roughshod' over the concerns of people in Levington. Neil Downing, 37, a father-of-two whose home is just 800ft from the proposed turbine site, told the Telegraph: 'The Scardinos are not going to have to see the turbines from where they live, but we are. 'It seems they will get all the financial and carbon footprint advantages while the rest of us will get all the disadvantages and none of the benefits. 'People are worried about the noise, about the devaluation of their homes and also as this is an AONB. If this goes ahead, what other developments are we going to see here in the future?' Plans: Suffolk Coastal district council documents show the application, with the turbine area in red, which the Scardinos have submitted . Other residents have expressed concerns that the turbines will be a 'blot on the landscape', after dismissing the Scardino's plans as a 'rich man's toy'. The Scardinos bought the 18th century property in Levington in 2005, but are known to spend much of their time in London or abroad. The Scardinos today responded by saying they are taking the project 'very seriously', and 'do not want to make out neighbours unhappy'. Albert Scardino told MailOnline: 'We take our stewardship of this small holding very seriously and have worked diligently to maintain and sustain it. 'We recognise that the erection of small wind turbines can cause strong reactions, and they are proliferating. 'We do not want to make our neighbours unhappy. As has been the case with every aspect of our work, we will attempt to mitigate the impact on them as much as possible through our extensive programme of reforestation, hedge planting and coppice woodland development.' Mr Scardino said the couple undergone work to improve the natural habitat around their mansion, adding that the project involves 'small scale domestic turbines'. Dame Marjorie, 65, is one of Britain's most influential and powerful business figures, having been in charge of Pearson PLC for 15 years. She is said to have received almost £10m last year as chief executive of Pearson, the world's largest book publisher which owns Penguin Books and the Financial Times. In February last year Pearson announced a 28 per cent increase in annual pre-tax profits to £670m, which Dame Marjorie hailed as the firm's 'best year ever'. Suffolk Coastal district council said the application for the Sardinos wind turbines would be considered at an upcoming meeting this month after receiving over 200 objections from residents, as well as an objection from the local parish council. A spokesperson for Suffolk Coast and Heaths Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty also advised recommended the Scardinos reduce the size of the tallest turbine to 15m if they plan to get approval for the project. A spokesperson said the matter could be referred to a planning committee if there is a sufficient 'groundswell' of opposition, but stressed the final decision would come down to whether it complies with planning laws. A spokesperson for Dame Marjorie Scardino was approached by MailOnline but did not respond to requests for comment.","Dame Marjorie Scardino plans for 85ft turbines in picturesque Suffolk village .

Vince Cable has been branded a 'socialist' and unfit for office by one of David Cameron's top advisers. In a stinging attack on the Business Secretary, Adrian Beecroft, whose controversial employment reform report was published yesterday, says Mr Cable 'appears to do very little to support business' despite being in charge of it in Britain. Nick Clegg also regularly 'threatens to go nuclear' and dissolve the Coalition 'if he doesn’t get his way', the venture capitalist also claimed, adding the Lib Dems are damaging the UK economy. Mr Beecroft's blueprint for work reforms, asked for by Downing Street, proposed small firms be exempted from rules on unfair dismissal, company pensions, flexible working rights and even employing children. But Lib Dems, led by Vince Cable, insisted a dilution of workers' rights on such a scale was unthinkable and argued that it would hit consumer confidence, branding Beecroft's recommendations 'bonkers'. Battle royale: Vince Cable, left, is a 'socialist', according to David Cameron's adviser Adrian Beecroft, right, who should never have been put in charge of the Government's business brief . It came as yesterday the Deputy Prime Minister was branded a communist for declaring Britain a nation of snobs. Universities should favour promising state school applicants, even if they had worse grades than private school rival, he said, but Tim Hands, master of Magdalen College School in Oxford, said the plan was ‘old-style communist'. In an interview with the Telegraph today Mr Beecroft said the Business Secretary’s objections to his report are 'ideological not economic'. 'I think he is a socialist who found a home in the Lib Dems, so he’s one of the Left,' he added. 'I think people find it very odd that he’s in charge of business and yet appears to do very little to support business.' And in a direct attack on the party he has donated thousands to, he called on the Tories to stand up to their Lib Dem Coalition partners. 'I do think they (the Tories) are hugely held back by the Lib Dems. I think you could put together a bunch of suggestions out of the report, as a coherent programme, that would say, you know, we are tackling the issues that business has with employment law but the Lib Dems will have none of it,' he said. Tantrums: Mr Beecroft claims that Nick Clegg threatens to break-up the Coalition if he doesn't get his own way and the PM should stand up to him more . 'Nick Clegg is always threatening to go nuclear and dissolve the whole thing if he doesn’t get his way with this, that and the other. Which you’d think actually must be a hollow threat. Therefore, why can’t the Government be more robust? I don’t know what the answer is. But it is disappointing.' In a speech yesterday Mr Clegg suggested society was as dominated by class as it had been almost a century ago, and universities should favour promising state school applicants, even if they had worse grades than private school rivals. Those who ignored it would be fined, he said. But his comments sparked a backlash from the independent school sector. Social mobility: Nick Clegg, pictured yesterday, promised that top universities would be forced to take on more state educated pupils, a move that saw him branded a 'communist' Tim Hands, master of Magdalen College School in Oxford, said Mr Clegg’s plan was the ‘old-style communist creation of a closed market’ that betrayed parents who paid for a private education. ‘Many parents make huge sacrifices in order to get the best possible education for their children. Privileged politicians propose to betray those parents and their values. But venture capitalist Mr Beecroft's anger was also aimed directly at the Prime Minister. David Cameron was accused last night of giving up on plans to reform unfair dismissal laws by the author of an official report on boosting jobs and growth. Downing Street doctored it, it has been claimed, with eight pages of the original 'independent' document removed or tampered with. It came at a time when the Prime Minister was forced to apologise for aiming sexist comments at a female MP in Parliament including the infamous 'calm down dear' attack, and the Tories feared they were alienating women voters. It appears the report was changed before it was sent to Vince Cable's Business department last October, despite Mr Cameron's own advisers telling him that he was risking Britain's economic recovery by doing so. These experts said that the Coalition's policies were too family-friendly, and this was not good for business or growth. Today Mr Beecroft suggested the Prime Minister was reneging on a deal to make it easier for small firms to fire failing staff. Mr Beecroft told the Daily Mail the move would make businesses more likely to take people on, and expressed frustration that the Conservatives had not been 'firmer' in the face of Lib Dem objections. 'It's very difficult having a coalition between a centre-right party and a party a lot of whose ideas are very left,' said the Conservative donor. 'It means striking compromises, and things that a centre, middle person like me would think are good ideas just don't happen. 'It's impossible to know from the outside where Conservatives could be firmer and insisting on things. But I do think it is disappointing that they appear to have given up on unfair dismissal.'","Cable 'is a socialist who found a home in the Lib Dems,' says employment reform adviser Adrian Beecroft .

Thousands of English and Welsh students will be able to claim free tuition at Scottish universities by claiming Irish grandparents, it was revealed today. Last week, it emerged that students from Northern Ireland could avoid fees by taking dual Republic of Ireland citizenship and applying as EU students, which would result in them having their fees paid under European equality law. The Scottish Government played down the development, saying it would only apply to a small number of students. Loophole: Thousands of English and Welsh students will be able to claim free tuition at Scottish universities by claiming Irish grandparents . But it has now emerged that anyone who lives in the UK who has an Irish grandparent can obtain an Irish passport and apply under the same loophole. Nearly 625,000 people living in England and Wales claimed Irish ethnicity in the 2001 census – and as many as six million across the UK are estimated to have at least one Irish grandparent. In some cases, even UK residents with an Irish great-grandparent could apply for an Irish passport. Opened up: Anyone who lives in the UK who has an Irish grandparent can obtain an Irish passport and apply under the loophole . The children and grandchildren of people of other EU nationalities living in England and Wales could also use the same loophole. Under . new legislation, students from England, Wales and Northern Ireland . should pay fees of up to £9,000 a year to attend Scots universities, . while Scots students study for free. But the loophole raises the prospect of a flood of applicants from around the UK. The development may mean greater competition for university places in Scotland. Competition: University of Edinburgh, pictured, is just one of the institutions which may have a greater number of applicants due to the loophole . There may also be disadvantages for . students applying under the EU route, with a legal question mark over . whether their nationality takes precedence over where they live. A legal loophole could allow students from England and Wales who have Irish grandparents or parents to apply for Republic of Ireland citizenship and then apply to study in Scotland as EU students, which would result in their university fees being paid under European equality law. So how can English or Welsh students with Irish heritage go about this? According to the Embassy of Ireland website, if you were born outside of Ireland, and one or both of your parents were born in Ireland, then you are automatically an Irish citizen from birth and can apply directly to the Irish Passport Office in London for an Irish passport. Whereas if you have a grandparent who was born on in Ireland, but both you and your parents were born outside Ireland, you can claim Irish citizenship through your Irish-born grandparent through Foreign Births Registration. If your parent has already become an Irish citizen through Foreign Births Registration before you were born, you are entitled to claim Irish citizenship through them. Once you have gained Irish citizenship, you can then apply to study for free through UCAS at a Scottish University as a non-UK EU student using your Irish nationality. There is also the possibility of receiving extra help with living costs for some degree courses by applying as an EU national to the Student Awards Agency for Scotland. Last . night, a spokesman for Universities Scotland, which represents . principals, said: ‘Based on the most recent statistics available, there . is no indication that Scotland’s universities have seen a rise in . applicants holding an Irish passport. ‘Universities Scotland continues to seek clarity from the Government on this issue.’ Gordon Watson, president of the University and College Union Scotland, which represents lecturers, said: ‘Those with a dual European passport will compete with Scottish students for the capped number of places in clearing and a huge rise in such applications is likely next year. ‘This shows the introduction of fees for UK students outside Scotland will play havoc with the admissions process as universities try to maximise student intake from the diminishing number of UK students who will pay fees.’ Robin Parker, president of NUS Scotland, said: ‘We must see clarity on this issue so students can make an informed choice about what places are available and what support they will be able to receive.’ A Scottish Government spokesman said: ‘Students who hold dual UK and EU nationality have been able to apply for fee support as non-UK EU nationals at Scottish universities for a number of years, but there is no evidence to suggest this has ever happened on a significant scale or that it is likely to. ‘Eligibility for claiming nationality varies by state and it is for the student to prove they hold EU nationality before the relevant date. We closely monitor application trends and are prepared to act if it appears that issues such as this are arising. ‘We are also exploring the introduction of an EU management fee, within the bounds of EU law.’ ‘We continue to seek clarity.'","Thousands of English and Welsh students will be able to gain free tuition at Scottish universities by claiming Irish grandparents .

The latest accuser in the Jerry Sandusky sex abuse trial recalled showering with the disgraced coach and being touched and fondled by him when he was just 10 years old. The man, now 27 and dubbed 'Victim 7' by prosecutors, said he never told anyone about the alleged abuse, but remains disgusted by chest hair because it brings back the memories of Sandusky pressing against him. He testified that Sandusky had often touched him on the knees and crotch and it escalated to him 'touching my penis.' Scroll down for video . Disgraced: Another alleged victim of Jerry Sandusky, seen arriving in court on Wednesday, said the ex-coach washed his hair in a Penn State locker room shower and tried to dry him off . In testimony recorded by the Philadelphia Inquirer, the alleged victim said that Sandusky coaxed him into taking a shower with him after tossing a football around at Penn State. In the locker room, the man said Sandusky insisted on washing his hair and tried to wash his body, but he would not let him. Sandusky also tried to dry him off with a towel, but again, the boy refused. Grim testimony: Sandusky, seen arriving in court today, heard from two of his alleged victims on the third day of the trial . He spoke of attending Penn State football games with Sandusky's family and receiving free tickets from him as recently as 2009. 'I wanted to go to games, I tried to block that stuff out and focus on the positives,' he said. The man said he only told his parents of the abuse last year, after being approached by police. 'The more negative thing I sort of put in the back part of my mind - closing a door, putting stuff in the attic is what I feel I did,' he said. The testimony followed that of another accuser, who said he was 11 years old when Sandusky pinned him while wrestling in his basement, and performed oral sex on him before threatening that 'he would never see his family again' if he told anyone, an accuser testified today. 'Victim 10,' now 25, told the court that Sandusky assaulted him in the basement of the ex-Penn State assistant coach's State College home in the late 1990s, then threatened to keep him away from his biological family. He claimed that he was about 11 years old and wrestling with Sandusky in his basement when the coach suddenly removed his shorts and began performing oral sex on him. 'The defendant pinned me to the ground, pulled my shorts down and began performing oral sex on me. I freaked out.' He said that Sandusky stopped after several minutes and went upstairs before threatening him. 'He told me that if I ever told anyone that I'd never see my family again,' the accuser testified.Later, Sandusky offered a friendlier tone. Accuser's account: 'Victim 10' claims he was wrestling with Jerry Sandusky, seen arriving at the courthouse today, when the former coach suddenly pulled his shorts down and performed oral sex on him . Day 3: Jerry Sandusky arrives to the courthouse on Wednesday morning with his attorney Joe Amendola . 'He apologised for saying that,' the witness said. 'He told me he didn't mean it and that he loved me.' The accuser added that he believed Sandusky's wife Dottie - who has come under much scrutiny about what she may have known about the alleged abuse - was home at the time. The man said Sandusky assaulted other times in 1998 and 1999, including once at a pool and another time in the same basement that involved performing oral sex on each other. He is one of two men who came forward after Sandusky was initially charged in November with assaulting eight boys. Later on Wednesday, a co-worker of a janitor who said he witnessed sex abuse involving Sandusky about 10 years ago testified on the worker's behalf. Out for the night: Sandusky leaves court after hours of dramatic testimony from alleged sex abuse victims . The boy's identity is not known to prosecutors, and the janitor, Jim Calhoun, is unable to testify himself because he had dementia. Ron Petrosky said Calhoun - white with fear and hands shaking nervously - told him in a team locker room at the time that he saw Sandusky making a boy perform oral sex on him. Mr Petrosky, a maintenance worker who still works at the school, also revealed that in 2000, he saw two sets of legs close together in a shower that appeared to belong to a young boy and a much older man, according to StateCollege.com. Later, he claimed he saw Sandusky and a boy emerge from the locker room, both with wet hair. 'I said, 'Good evening, coach.' They exited the double doors and walked down the long hallway... about three quarters of the way down Jerry took the boy's hand,' Petrosky said. Sandusky faces a total of 52 criminal counts involving alleged assaults over a 15-year span. Under cross-examination, the man testified that he was the roommate of another Sandusky accuser at a camp sponsored by Sandusky's charity, The Second Mile. Star witness: Yesterday, former Penn State quarterback and coach Mike McQueary, left, testified that he witnessed Sandusky performing a sex act on a young boy in a locker room shower . The alleged victim admitted he had spent nearly two years in state prison for a robbery and involvement with alcohol and drugs, but said he has since cleaned up his act. 'I'm married. I'm expecting' a child, he said. Earlier Wednesday, the father of former assistant coach Mike McQueary told the jury details of a phone call he had with his son after the former Penn State quarterback allegedly saw Sandusky behind a boy with his hands propped against a wall in a locker room shower, and heard 'skin-on-skin smacking sounds.' Two other alleged victims have already testified, describing in graphic detail encounters with the coach that happened after they met him through his charity for at-risk youth. Dad on the stand: John McQueary, the father of former assistant coach Mike McQueary, testified about what his son told him after he allegedly saw Sandusky in the shower with a young boy . Sandusky, 68, has denied the allegations. Authorities say he abused the boys in hotels, at his home and inside the football team's headquarters. Sandusky's attorneys have suggested his accusers have financial motivations for coming forward. Earlier in the trial . On Tuesday, Former Penn State assistant coach Mike McQueary told jurors in Jerry Sandusky's sex abuse trial today that he saw his ex-colleague with a boy in an on-campus shower after hearing 'skin-on-skin smacking sounds.' Star witness: Mike McQueary testified on Tuesday that he saw Sandusky with a young boy in a locker room shower . He said that he turned and glanced over his right shoulder at a mirror that had a 45-degree angle and saw Sandusky 'standing behind a boy who was propped up against a wall'. He estimated the boy to be ten to 12 years old. He said that the 'boy's hands (were) up on the wall. The glance would have taken only one or two seconds. I immediately turned back to my locker to make sure I saw what I saw'. McQueary’s testimony came after ‘Victim No. 1’ tearfully recounted repeated instances of Sandusky kissing him, fondling him and oral sex, mostly in the basement of Sandusky's State College home during sleepovers. Now 18, the witness recounted an early encounter that escalated to oral sex. 'I spaced,' the alleged victim said. 'I didn't know what to do with all the thoughts running through my head, I just kind of blacked out and didn't want it to happen. I froze.' As he choked back tears, the sobbing teen recounted another time Sandusky forced him to perform oral sex, after saying it was his 'turn'. On Monday, 'Victim No. 4 testified that the former Penn State assistant football coach sexually abused him as a young teenager on campus and in hotel saunas and later sent him 'creepy love letters'. The accuser said that what began as 'soap battles' in the shower escalated into inappropriate touching and oral sex and that Sandusky would threaten him if he refused.

Nearly four million square miles of the surface of Mars are covered with glass - and the discovery could be evidence that the Red Planet once harboured life. Martians, of course, are not peering at us through double-glazing - instead, the glass sand that covers Mars is evidence of lava interacting with ice or water, an ideal recipe for the creation of life. One of the most popular theories of how life on Earth formed is that undersea volcanic vents created a chemical 'soup' where the first life forms evolved. Volcanic glass on Mars: Martians, of course, are not peering at us through double-glazing - instead, the glass sand that covers Mars is evidence of lava interacting with ice or water, an ideal recipe for the creation of life . Looking in the wrong place? An image of the Viking 1 Martian lander which touched down on the Red Planet in 1976 and took soil samples and pictures of the surface . Mars is covered in volcanic glass - direct evidence that water and hot magma once interacted on the Red Planet. 'The glass is most likely volcanic glass produced during explosive . eruptions, and potential sources include volcano-ice interactions in the . northern lowlands,' say researchers Briony Horgan and James F. Bell of Arizona State University. 'The glass deposits also exhibit signs of weathering, . indicating widespread interactions with liquid water.' 'These interactions that could create the perfect environments for microbial life,' says Astrobiology Magazine, which reported the research. 'Under the hyper-arid climatic conditions Mars has experienced over the past three billion years or more, the most likely source of this water is melting ice or snow,' says Horgan. 'These results suggest that explosive volcanism may be a major source of sediments on Mars, and that limited liquid water has been present at the surface of Mars even under long-term hyper-arid conditions.' The glass on the surface could be a sign of water beneath the surface - or of long-preserved signatures of vanished life forms. Many areas of Mars show evidence of past water: The enormous 48-mile long crater that is also one mile deep displays evidence at its edges of channels that could have been created by water displaced by the meteor impact . The European Space Agency's Mars Express orbiter revealed that up to four million square miles of volcanic glass cover the surface of the Red Planet . ‘We definitely know searching for organisms in the northern . lowlands is difficult,’ Horgan said. ‘I think the better place to go would be . those source regions, the ice-magma interactions.’","Four million square miles of volcanic glass detected on Martian surface .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 18:32 EST, 20 June 2011 . Web addresses that end in .ford, .tesco and even .gaga could be introduced under a major shake-up of the internet. Domain names are currently limited to the 290 for countries including .co.uk and 22 suffixes such as .tel for telecommunications. But the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, which polices the internet, has voted for a major liberalisation that could add hundreds more address endings. The new phase in domain names comes as the emergence of tablet computers such as Apple's iPad is changing the way people access the Internet . Groups able to put up a £114,000 fee can petition for the right to use nearly any word in any language, including Arabic and Chinese. Firms, charities, political parties, celebrities and ordinary individuals would be allowed to apply under what is being billed as the biggest shake-up in the naming regime since the .com address appeared 26 years ago. Peter Dengate Thrush of Icann said: ‘This is the start of a whole new phase for the internet. ‘Unless there is a good reason to restrain it, innovation should be allowed to run free.’ Analysts say they expect to see between 500 and 1,000 new domain names, mostly companies and products, but also cities such as London and generic names such as .bank or .hotel. Besides the fee, applicants will have to show a legitimate claim to the name they are buying. Icann is taking on hundreds of consultants to adjudicate on the claims. It will accept applications for new names from January 12. Shake-up: Internet regulators have voted to change the rules for domain names . Rod Beckstrom, ICANN President and CEO, said: 'ICANN has opened the Internet's naming system to unleash the . global human imagination. 'Today's decision respects the rights of groups to create new top level domains in any language or script. 'We hope this allows the domain name system to better serve all of mankind.' The move could usher in the most sweeping transformation of the Domain Name System since its creation in the 1980s. More than 300 suffixes are available today, the bulk of them country-code domains, such as '.uk' for the United Kingdom and '.de' for Germany. But potentially millions more suffixes could now be created, categorised by everything from industry to geography to ethnicity. The new system could bring innovative branding opportunities and allow all sorts of niche communities to thrive online. But businesses worry that they'll have to grab their brand names before others do. New suffixes could also create confusion as consumers navigate a Web with unfamiliar labels. It's also possible that the new names won't make much difference because many people these days rely on search engines and mobile applications to find what they are looking for online. It won't be cheap to operate a domain name suffix. The application fee . is $185,000, and winners will have to pay $25,000 annually after that. Disputes are likely as different groups go after the same domain. ICANN . may auction off domains if multiple parties have legitimate claims. Legal fees could also pile up as trademark owners and governments file . objections to certain applications. Trademark holders, in particular, fear they would have to register a lot . of addresses they don't need or want simply to keep others from using . them. Microsoft Corp., for instance, would not want websites addresses . such as 'Microsoft.software' and 'Microsoft.computer' used to commit . fraud or sell pirated goods. Copyright owners, too, worry they would have to devote more resources to . fighting online piracy with a proliferation of websites ending in '.movies' and '.music' that distribute copyrighted content illegally. ICANN has crafted rules meant to give trademark owners a first shot at . claiming their brands. It would also have a process to quickly take down . addresses that are clear violations. Consumers don't type web addresses into browsers nearly as much as they did 15 years ago when talk of a domain name expansion began. 'Most people don't pay a lot of attention to website addresses anyway these days,' said Danny Sullivan, editor of Search Engine Land, a website that covers the search industry. From a technical standpoint, domain names tell computers on the Internet where to find a website or send an email message. Without them, people would have to remember clunky numerals such as '165.1.59.220' for 'ap.org.' The monikers have grown to mean much more, however. Amazon.com Inc. has built its brand on its website address, while bloggers take pride in running sites with their own domain names. ICANN has already allowed two major expansions of the addressing system. In 2000, it approved seven new domains, including '.info' and '.biz.' It began accepting new bids again in 2004. It has approved and added seven from that round, including '.xxx' for pornography sites this past March. Under the expansion plan, future applications would be streamlined and open to all companies, organizations and individuals. That has set off a virtual land rush. A group of entrepreneurs in Las Vegas is vying to operate a '.Vegas' suffix. They have the city's endorsement and consider '.Vegas' a way to unify local merchants, entertainment venues, residents and even businesses beyond Sin City. Former professional hockey player Ron Andruff is working with international sports federations to bid for '.sport.' He expects sports leagues, teams, athletes, equipment makers and fans to want websites with a suffix that defines them better. Two groups - one backed by the Sierra Club and the other by the World Wildlife Federation - are separately seeking the right to operate a '.eco' suffix. Big business will stake claims, too. Printer and camera maker Canon Inc. plans to apply for '.Canon'. Trade groups for bankers and financial-services companies are working together to explore bids for '.bank', '.insure' and '.invest' for their member companies. New domains offer fresh branding possibilities for companies to identify themselves online in 'a more relevant or a more localized' way, said Pat Kane, a senior vice president at VeriSign Inc., which operates '.com' and '.net.' Although suffixes added over the past decade haven't been as popular as '.com,' there has been demand for an expansion because nearly all of the most desirable '.com' addresses have been taken. There are more than 94 million registered under '.com.'","Overhaul could see sites ending .apple, .orange or .sony ."

'She was an outstanding and gifted research student and a lively, engaging and caring young woman.' He added that her death had affected many colleagues and friends on campus. Neighbours near their home yesterday said the couple had a young baby. One resident, who did not want to be named, said: 'The police told us that they had an 11-week-old baby. 'I heard from a friend there was lots of drink involved apparently. Police told me they had never been in trouble before. 'It’s so sad. So sad - especially with a baby involved. It’s just awful what can happen, just like that.' The address is two doors down from the former home of Admiral Phillip, the first governor of Australia, who lived at the address between 1806 and 1814. It lies opposite The Assembly Rooms, a magnificent 18th century building which is now used as a museum and exclusive wedding venue.

Amendments: The book (left) includes Ronnie Barker's limerick (right), dated November 2001, which explains why he improved Lear's poems . The 19th century author of The Owl And . The Pussycat wrote limericks using the same word at the end of the . first and last lines – to Barker’s obvious frustration. He wrote at the start of the book: . ‘There was an old fossil named Lear, Who’s [sic] verses were boring and . drear, His last lines were worse, just the same as the first! So I’ve . tried to improve on them here.’ Rival in rhyme: Edward Lear, who died in 1888 . The book, signed by Barker, is up for . auction with a guide price of £1,500. He is thought to have made his . amendments in 2001, four years before his death at 76. Other limericks he changed included: . ‘There was a Young Lady of Turkey, who wept when the weather was murky; . When the day turned out fine, she ceased to repine, That capricious . Young Lady of Turkey.’ Barker replaced the last line with: ‘In fact, she . became rather perky.’ He did the same with: ‘There was an . Old Man of the Dee, who was sadly annoyed by a flea; When he said, “I . will scratch it”, they gave him a hatchet, Which grieved that Old Man of . the Dee.’ Barker changed it to: ‘And he cut his leg off at the knee’ – . which also fitted Lear’s illustration of a man wielding a hatchet next . to a man’s leg. However Barker, described by Ronnie Corbett as a ‘master . of the English language’, could not always find inspiration and next to . the limerick ‘There was an old Man of the South’, he wrote simply: . ‘Impossible – no further rhymes.’ By the end he’d clearly had enough . because he changed the final verse to read: ‘There was a Young Lady of . Clare, who was sadly pursued by a bear; When she found she was tired, . she abruptly expired, And so do these rhymes – in despair!’ The book was found by chance among a . job lot bought by collector John Watts, 40, of Taunton, Somerset. It . will be auctioned at the Dominic Winter saleroom near Cirencester, . Gloucestershire, on June 21. Changes: Barker's revision of 'There Was An Old Man With A Beard' Scribble: Barker wrote an alternative ending to 'There Was An Old Man Of The Dee' Notes: 'There Was An Old Person of Ischia' is one of more than 100 limericks revised by Barker . Widely considered to be the creator of nonsense verse, Edward Lear was also an accomplished author, artist and illustrator. He . was born into a middle-class family in Holloway, London, in 1812, but . suffered ill health - including epileptic seizures - from childhood. Lear travelled widely throughout his life and eventually settled in Sanremo, Italy, where his body is buried. He . briefly gave drawing lessons to Queen Victoria, and he journeyed to . Italy, Greece, Egypt, India and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) to perfect his . art. He helped popularise the limerick when he published A Book of Nonsense in 1846. There were three editions. His most famous nonsense work, The Owl and the Pussycat, was published in 1867. Lear died in 1888. A spokesman for the saleroom said: ‘If . one had to name Ronnie Barker’s comedy ancestors then the name of . Edward Lear would surely feature. 'Both were masters of comic word play.’ But he added: ‘To modern day readers . such as Barker’s generation and ours, the limerick form has to end with a . funny punchline in the fifth brand new line. ‘What struck Barker as odd was that . Lear used the same rhyming word as the first line, making the limerick . an anti-climax of non-humour. ‘I think Lear’s more nonsensical . treatment of the limerick form he invented was deliberate rather than . second-rate. 'They were, after all, published in his “Book Of Nonsense”.’ Lear’s book, however, did contain at . least one limerick of which Barker approved, and commented next to it: . ‘This is the first one I have ever seen that didn’t use the same word!’ The acceptable limerick goes: ‘There . was an Old Man who supposed, that the street door was partially closed; . But some very large rats, ate his coats and his hats, While that futile . old gentleman dozed.’ Barker approved of this poem, and wrote: 'This is the first one I have ever seen that didn't use the same word!' Crossed out: Barker amended the final line of 'There Was An Old Person Of Bangor'","Barker's copy of Edward Lear's Nonsense Verse is expected to fetch £1,500 at auction .

The U.S. government has revealed details of serious allegations against Secret Service agents and officers going back to 2004, among them claims of involvement with prostitutes, leaking sensitive information, publishing pornography, sexual assault, illegal wiretaps, improper use of weapons and drunkenness. The heavily censored 229-page document was released with little fanfare under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act on the heels of the embarrassing Secret Service prostitution scandal that erupted in April in Colombia. It describes accusations filed against Secret Service agents with the Homeland Security Department's inspector general. Bad history: The allegations against Secret Service agents detailed in the document go back to 2004 . Some of the accusations occurred as recently as last month. In many cases, the government noted that some of the claims were resolved administratively, and others were being formally investigated. The new disclosures of so many serious accusations lend weight to concerns expressed by Congress that the prostitution scandal exposed a culture of misconduct within the agency charged with protecting the U.S. president and other top officials. Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan apologized for the incident during a hearing in May but insisted that what happened in Colombia was an isolated case. Seedy: The U.S. Secret Service agent allegedly took Miss Suarez to his room in Cartagena's Hotel Caribe after agreeing to pay her $800 for sex . Secret Service officials did not immediately respond Friday to questions about the accusations. The complaints included an alleged sexual assault reported in August of 2011. In the heavily redacted entry, an agent was accused of pushing a female co-worker onto a bed during a work trip. —October 2011: An employee was accused of sending harassing messages to a woman who interpreted them to be sexual harassment. —March . 2011: A complaint was filed involving embezzlement or theft of public . money. Nearly the entire entry was censored save for a notation that it . was adjudicated by a judge. —October 2010: An employee was . implicated in a national security leak. The details were censored, and . the records didn't include a disposition of the case. —May 2012: . An employee was accused of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. No details were provided, other than that the case was closed . administratively. —May 2012: An officer was videotaped, twice, wandering nude around an apartment complex. —January . 2011: Police in New York arrested an investigative support assistant on . charges sexual abuse. The records do not list an outcome for the case. —2005: . An armed agent was accused of threatening to shut down a strip club . because it was charging $40 for lap dances and $25 for table-side . dances, which the agent said was against federal law. The incident was . reported in May 2012. The employee ‘got on top of (censored) attempting to have sex,’ even though the woman ‘told (censored) 'no' several times.’ The entry noted that supervisors described the accused as ‘a conscientious and dependable employee.’ The incident was closed with an ‘administrative disposition’ in February. They also included an anonymous complaint in October of 2003 that a Secret Service agent ‘may have been involved with a prostitution ring,’ noting that two telephone numbers belonging to the unnamed agent, who has since retired, turned up as part of an FBI investigation into a prostitution ring. In addition, in 2005, an employee was reported to the Washington field office for being arrested on a charge of solicitation in a park. Documents do not reveal the outcome of that case.In 2008, an on-duty uniform division officer was arrested in a Washington prostitution sting. The officer, who was driving a marked Secret Service vehicle at the time, was placed on administrative leave, according to the released records. Sullivan said during the May hearing that the officer was later fired. Some of the allegations were obviously false, such as a complaint in August of 2010 that a Secret Service agent had performed experiments and implanted stimulators in a citizen's brain. The list also included dozens of complaints about fraudulent emails that circulate widely on the Internet and appear to come from the Secret Service. Escort: Huntington's fight with Dania Suarez sparked a major scandal and an internal investigation . A dozen Secret Service officers, . agents and supervisors were implicated in the Colombia scandal and eight . have been forced out of the agency. At least two employees are fighting . to get their jobs back. The scandal that shed light on an . apparent culture of permissiveness within the Secret Service broke in . mid-April when a high-priced Colombian call girl known then only as . ‘Dania’ went public with allegations that a Secret Service that hired . her for sex refused to pay her $800 for her services. What followed next was a series of embarrassing and explosive revelations the cost several agents their jobs. Secret Service supervisor David Chaney . was forced to retire over his alleged role in the incident, his . colleague while Greg Stokes was 'removed with cause.’ Taking care of business: Suarez said that she is now willing to sell her story . Proposal: Dania Suarez said she and one of the agents agreed he would pay her $800 for sex at the hotel . Another agent resigned after being suspended as part of the investigation into the scandal. Speaking about the tawdry episode that has seen three agents ousted from their posts after a wild night of partying in Cartagena, 24-year-old prostitute Dania Suarez. claimed she was offered $30 - a fraction of her $800 fee - for a night with one of the men, identified later as Arthur Huntington, that she met at the discotheque Pleyclub. In an interview in Colombia, Suarez, a single mother of a nine-year-old boy, she said two agents argued over the price, ending with Colombian law enforcement involved. She said she was eventually paid about $225. She described the men as 'completely stupid' and that she didn't know how they had come to be a part of Obama's security team. Seedy: The PleyClub, in Cartagena, Colombia, where Obama's Secret Service agents allegedly picked up prostitutes . Huntington left the agency in May, but the circumstances of his departure are unclear. Eleven Secret Service agents were eventually sent home from the colonial-era city of Cartagena on Colombia's Caribbean coast after a wild night of partying that saw many of the agents bring escorts back to their rooms, according to reports. The agents were in town in advance of President Barack Obama's arrival for the Summit of the Americas. The incident occurred before Obama arrived and was at a different hotel than the president stayed in.","229-page censored document released under Freedom of Information Act .
