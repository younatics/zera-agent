"By . Nik Simon . Follow @@Nik_Simon88 . Wales have been forced to devise a contingency plan for Saturday's opening Test against South Africa as George North battles to overcome a virus. The Northampton wing has been in isolation from his team-mates and head coach Warren Gatland is preparing to wait until the eleventh hour before making a call over his inclusion for the game at Durban's Kings Park Stadium. Should North, 22, fail to recover then he will join fellow British and Irish Lions Leigh Halfpenny, Richard Hibbard, Justin Tipuric and Sam Warburton on the Welsh absentee list. Doubt: Wales winger George North is suffering from a 'mild virus' and may miss the first Test with South Africa . Prolific: North (left) is Wales' talisman and has scored 19 tries in 40 international appearances for Wales . 'He is . still struggling, to be honest,' said Gatland. 'He felt a bit nauseous . on Tuesday and he's unfortunately had a bit of stomach trouble so he has . been in his room and had food taken up to him. 'He's . making some slow progress and we will make a decision on him on Friday, . or even later. We are aware that even if he does take to the field he . is probably going to struggle a bit for  80 minutes. 'I . am taking the advice of the medics. They say he is improving and we are . hopeful he will be a lot better. It would be a big loss if he doesn't . make it but we don't want to jeopardise his wellbeing and we have got to . make sure he is well enough to take the field in terms of giving a good . performance, too. 'If he doesn't pull through,  it would be someone else's opportunity.' Uncapped Scarlets winger Jordan Williams is favourite to fill the potential void on the left flank. The . 20-year-old has lit up the RaboDirect Pro 12 and the Heineken Cup with . his dazzling footwork and has the potential to become a long-term . favourite among the Welsh ranks. Gatland . said: 'I know there has been a lot made of Jordan's resemblance to . Shane Williams in terms of skill and ability. He is very talented and we . have not seen his full range of skills yet. There was a lovely offload . in the game against the Eastern Province Kings on Tuesday, he can kick . off both feet and he has a hugely promising future ahead of him. 'Hopefully we will see a lot more of him.' Headache: Wales head coach Warren Gatland (pictured) is already without several other key players . Daunting: Wales travel to face South Africa having never beaten the Springboks in their own back yard . 'We . have been running the other options in training in case George doesn't . pull through. We will probably go with Jordan or there is an option with . Liam Williams and playing Matthew Morgan at full back. Cory Allen could . come on the bench as well. 'Obviously George covers midfield as well and we need to think of that in terms of who would cover that area.' Elsewhere . Gatland has stuck with the same backline that started the final Six . Nations game against Scotland. The midfield combination of Jamie Roberts . and Jonathan Davies should be one of the biggest weapons against a . Springboks side that are without their five top-ranked centres. 'We . have a settled backline with a lot of experience, from nine through to . 15,' said Roberts. 'We have to utilise that as it means a lot in . international rugby and we need to use that factor for us against a team . with fresh faces on the wing and in the centre.' Adam . Jones will make his 100th international appearance in the pack and the . tighthead prop will be hoping to mark his century with a first Welsh . victory over the Springboks on South African soil. The veteran is joined . in the pack by Scarlets flanker Aaron Shingler, who takes over the . openside duties in place of Warburton. 'Aaron . is a different type of seven,' said Gatland. 'He has played other roles . in the back row but what he does give us is another line-out option. 'He . has been in the set-up on and off for the last couple of seasons and . it's a big opportunity for him to go in there and make the most of this . chance.'","North will be given until the 11th hour to prove his fitness .

"By . Tara Brady . If you happen to be a girl, as well as your parents’ firstborn child, then congratulations – you’re in good company. Because according to a study, it’s no coincidence that some of the world’s most powerful women fall into that category. The research shows that firstborn girls are statistically more likely to be the most highly qualified of all their family. They are 13 per cent more ambitious then firstborn sons, according to a study conducted by the University of Essex. Successful: Both novelist JK Rowling and singer Beyoncé Knowles are firstborn children . So J.K. Rowling, Hillary Clinton, . Oprah Winfrey and Beyoncé – all the eldest children in their families – . were born with a greater chance of becoming high achievers. And . while all eldest children are 16 per cent more likely to attend further . education than their younger siblings, girls are 4 per cent more likely . to have better qualifications. But firstborn boys – such as Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and George W Bush – were next in line for success. Lead researcher Feifei Bu said: ‘There are several possible explanations for the higher attainment and ambition of the eldest. Angela Merkel, Hillary Clinton (left), Oprah Winfrey (right), JK Rowling and Beyoncé were all firstborn children . ‘It . could be that the parents simply devote more time and energy to them – . it could be they are actually more intelligent. For me, I tend to lean . towards the theory that parental investment is possibly at work here.’ The . report – Sibling Configurations, Educational Aspiration and Attainment – . followed 1,503 sibling groups and 3,532 individuals through the British . Household Panel Survey and its successor, Understanding Society. Feifei Bu, who led the study, at the University of Essex . Even . taking into account the parents’ education and professional status, the . study found firstborn children were still 7 per cent more likely to . aspire to stay on in education than younger siblings. More than half of . all Nobel prizewinners and US presidents have been firstborns. The . study looked at gender mix among siblings as well as the size of . families – excluding twins and only children – and found there was no . evidence that the sex of a second sibling made any difference to their . level of aspiration. However, . it did discover that leaving an age gap of at least four years between . siblings could improve the younger children’s levels of educational . attainment. Miss Bu told The . Observer: ‘I would say that the larger the age gap between the . children, the better their qualifications will be. ‘It . is interesting that we observe a distinct firstborn advantage in . education, even though parents in modern society are more likely to be . egalitarian in the way they treat their children.’ She added: ‘I’m the firstborn, of course. That is why I’m doing a PhD.’","Hillary Clinton, Oprah Winfrey, JK Rowling and Beyoncé are all firstborns .

"By . Lillian Radulova . A 64-year-old man has been sentenced to one year in jail for breaking a woman's jaw with his walking stick after she ran towards him attempting to break up a fight. William Warmisham told the Gold Coast Bulletin that he 'should have pleaded not bloody guilty' after being sentenced at the Southport District Court in Brisbane on Friday. The court heard that the incident occurred at the car park of the Surfers Paradise Tavern beer garden, where a fight began between the group Mr Warmisham was with and a number of other patrons in September of 2011. And while on bail for that offence the man incredibly tried to run down his former lover and her now boyfriend. A 64 year old man was sentenced to a year in jail on Friday after pleading guilty to striking a woman with his walking stick and breaking her jaw . The 34-year-old woman ran towards the group in the hope of stopping the fight which had just broken out, when the 64-year-old unexpectedly lashed out at her. It was at this point that the Crown prosecutor, Nicholas McGhee, said the accused struck her head with his walking stick. The woman was badly injured from the blow, requiring surgery for her fractured jaw. Despite pleading guilty to causing grievous bodily harm, Mr Warmisham claimed he acted in self defence. During his sentencing however, Judge Brian Devereaux rebutted his claims, stating that the woman had not been involved in the earlier dispute and was clearly attempting to prevent any further violence. Mr Warmisham's one-year sentence is an addition to his previously acquired sentence of two years. While on bail for assaulting the 34-year-old woman, he was sentenced to two years in prison for intentionally driving his car at his previous partner and her boyfriend. Warmisham will be released on parole on September 19. The man was sentenced at the Southport District Court in Brisbane on Friday .","William Warmisham struck a 34-year-old woman in the head in 2011 .

"By . Leon Osman . Leon Osman returns for his latest Footballers' Football Column, all about the World Cup. Osman was not selected by Roy Hodgson for a place in Brazil this summer but was involved in the England squad during the qualifying campaign. He also knows several of the England team very well through playing alongside them at Everton and has some words of advice for Hodgson ahead of the opening match against Italy on Saturday: play a team almost entirely made up of players who live or were born in Merseyside! The waiting and the anticipation for all football fans will finally be over this evening when the World Cup finally gets underway. Ever since the host nation for the 2014 tournament was first announced (without any controversy or bung allegations by the way!) the clamour for fans and players alike to go to watch or play in the home of the undisputed kings of international football has been incredible. Having played some part of the battle to be in Brazil myself I can tell you that every top player desperately wanted to be there to represent his country on the biggest stage. Tyro: Ross Barkley is in contention to play as an attacking midfielder for England against Italy . Each and every one of them will now be really looking forward to the tournament starting but they'll doubtless also spare a thought for those who, through no fault of their own, won't be involved. There seems to have been more unlucky players (who could well have made a big impact) this time than ever before. Radamel Falcao, Franck Ribery, Marco Reus, Christian Benteke, Rafael van der Vaart, Ricardo Montolivo all miss out injured, as do our own Theo Walcott and Jay Rodriguez. Then there are worries about Cristiano Ronaldo and Luis Suarez too. I was also disappointed that my former temporary team-mate Segundo Castillo was ruled out of the Ecuador squad with a bad injury. I don't think I've ever played alongside a lad who smiled more than Casty and it's a real shame for a lovely guy. They will all be missed but there is still enough quality and class to excite us. Everton connection: Osman's Toffees team-mates Leighton Baines (left) and Phil Jagielka (right) in Brazil . My . interest in England will, of course, be enhanced by the presence of . three of my team-mates in the squad. Phil Jagielka, Leighton Baines and . Ross Barkley all thoroughly deserve to be there and I hope Tim Howard . and Kevin Mirallas do well for their respective countries as well. And I don't want to forget all my former team-mates who are out there either so a big shout to Wayne Rooney, Tim Cahill, Marouane Fellaini, Nikica Jelavic, Joseph Yobo, Jo, Philippe Senderos, Shkodran Mustafi (who has done fantastically well to push his career on since leaving Everton) and Romelu Lukaku. I'm actually hoping that we get big Romelu back next season but I'm out of the loop on that one! It's great for Evertonians to have so many players to look out for but my own loyalty will obviously be with England. When I was part of the squad and playing a couple of games I did think I may have had a chance of going to Brazil but it was clear a long way out that I wasn't going to make it so I contented myself with being happy for Jags, Bazza and Ross... and also John Stones who make the stand-by list. Stonesy has been immense for us and for such a young player in such a challenging position on the pitch to even be considered for the World Cup shows how well he's done. Wish you wee there? Osman with World Cup-bound team-mates Baines (left) and Kevin Mirallas (right) Jags and Bazza are certain to start the games and I am sure that Roy Hodgson, who I have a great deal of time for and will always be grateful to for making me an England player, will utilise Ross's unique talent. Our three lads will be just as influential off the pitch as they are on it, by the way. They are three lively individuals who are great tourists and will more than play their part in keeping boredom at bay in Brazil... especially Bazza with his guitar! It all just shows how well Everton have done over the last few seasons. We could easily have three players starting a World Cup game for England and that's a terrific achievement that hasn't happened since the days of Reid, Lineker, Stevens and Steven back in 1986. In fact, you can stretch that to cover the whole city. Merseyside is very well represented in Roy's squad and it's not beyond the realms of possibility that the city has EIGHT players starting a game. In my opinion there are six-nailed on starters in Johnson, Jags, Bazza, Henderson, Gerrard and Sturridge and if you add Ross and Sterling to that list it makes for an incredible statistic. And if we add Wayne to that, as he's a scouser too, we can call it NINE! With regards to how England will do, I think the first game on Saturday against Italy is absolutely vital. Lose that one and there's a massive hill to climb to even get out of the group. Losing the first game can often prompt a media frenzy back home and the pressure can be cranked up even more than it is anyway. A defeat against Italy would also knock the confidence a bit. But let's be positive and believe that England can beat the Italians and the feelgood factor could carry us onwards and upwards. I genuinely think that's what will happen. Italy, for me, are not the force they have been in the past and if we get amongst them then we'll have too much for them. Now, what team would you pick? If for some inexplicable reason you woke up on Saturday morning with a voice message on your mobile from Roy Hodgson asking you to select the England team what would you do? Give him the nod: Wayne Rooney should play up front - and he still counts as a Merseysider, says Osman . One thing I can guarantee, and it's something that makes football special, is that everybody will have something slightly different from the guy or girl sitting next to you. It could be a different player in the team, a player in a different position, a different formation... anything. And discussing it and arguing with family and friends in front of the television or in the pub is what makes the World Cup so addictive. I know that my dad and my brother would select a different team to me...and I also know that my mum will do better with her bets than the three of us put together! However, when Roy rings me from Brazil, here's what I'll tell him. Big loss: The World Cup will be poorer for the loss of the likes of Franck Ribery through injury . 'Hello Roy, thanks for the call, hope all is well over there. You need Joe Hart in goal behind a flat back-four of Johnson, Cahill, Jagielka and Baines. Then you want a midfield three of Henderson, Gerrard and Wilshere with Barkley in the hole behind a top two of Sturridge and Rooney. That should be enough to beat Italy, so good luck and I'll ring you on Sunday with our line-up for Uruguay. Bye for now.' I actually think Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain would have had the role behind the strikers if he was fully fit but I would certainly trust Ross or Sterling to do the job. My team gets both the strikers operating just where they want to play. It gets us a man in the 'No 10' position who would be extremely difficult to mark when you have two strikers and it allows both of our full backs to get forward, which is what they both want to do. It leaves Steven Gerrard to drop deep and we'd still have two men in midfield. I believe this XI could do the job out there but it's not about what I think and I have absolute confidence that Roy will pick the right team. The beautiful home of the beautiful game:  Every footballer wanted to play in Brazil this summer . Regardless, we are clearly in a very tough group. Italy is always a difficult and tight game for us and Uruguay and Costa Rica are both very good teams who are far more used to the conditions in South America. Uruguay in particular have some outstanding individuals but whether I'm thinking with my head or my heart, I can see a way through for us. Indeed, I wouldn't be overly surprised if we win all three of our group games. I will certainly be cheering us on as enthusiastically as anyone and if we do reach the knockout stage anything can happen. I just hope we have a bit more luck than we normally do and if any of the later games go to penalties, here's my advice to Roy... don't call me!

"By . Freya Noble . and Emily Crane . A drug-crazed burglar who bludgeoned a baby to death in his cot for nothing more than a wallet and a pair of sunglasses during a home invasion will spend at least 32 years behind bars. A Victorian Supreme Judge handed Harley Hicks, 21, a life sentence on Friday after he broke into a Bendigo home in June 2012 and brutally bashed Zayden Veal-Whitting to death, a crime he described as 'totally and utterly evil'. Hicks, who was 19 at the time, has offered no explanation for why he bashed the 10-month-old more than 30 times with a homemade baton during the marijuana and ice-fuelled robbery. Scroll down for video . Harley Hicks has been sentenced to life in prison with 32 years non parole for the brutal murder of baby Zayden Veal-Whitting . 'It is almost unthinkable that any human being could have carried out such a sickening crime that you have committed,' Supreme Court Justice Stephen Kaye said in sentencing Hicks. 'What you did was totally and utterly evil.' Justice Kaye said he could not say for sure if Hicks had viciously snuffed out Zayden's cry in a bid to silence the baby during the robbery. 'If that constituted your motive for killing Zayden, then you murdered an innocent child so that you could escape the premises with the valuable items that you had stolen from it,' he said. 'On the other hand, if that was not your motive, then your murder of Zayden was simply an act of unmitigated evil committed by you for the sheer sake of it.' Zayden suffered a crushed skull, a broken collar bone and a broken rib as a result of the attack. Justice Kaye said Hicks perpetrated an extraordinarily violent bashing on Zayden involving multiple blows with the baton to the head, face and other parts of his body. Zayden's mother Casey Veal arriving at the Supreme Court in Bendigo on Friday to see her son's killer sentenced . 'He was utterly harmless, defenceless and helpless,' he said. 'Any human being with even a shred of decency and humanity could only feel compassion, tenderness and protectiveness towards an infant in those circumstances. 'By contrast, you inflicted a brutal bashing, with a lethal instrument, on that baby. 'You crushed his skull, you savagely beat him with at least 30 blows. Justice Kaye said Hicks, of North Bendigo, had shown no remorse. 'At no stage of the trial could I detect from you any sign of remorse. Nor was there even the slightest indication by you of any pity or sympathy for the baby, whose life you had taken, or for his family, whose lives you have shattered. 'Rather, you seemed totally oblivious and impervious to such human feelings.' The judge also described the English language as being 'entirely inadequate' to describe the horror and grief Zayden's mother, Casey Veal, and her family went through. Zayden's father James at the sentencing on Friday . Hicks used marijuana and ice before the murder, committed amid a spate of burglaries in the Bendigo suburb of Long Gully in June 2012. In the early hours of June 15, he broke into Ms Veal's house, unplugged the baby monitor and struck Zayden. When Ms Veal woke the next morning her eldest son Xavier let her know all the doors were open in the house, and they soon discovered they'd been robbed. It was then she discovered her youngest child beaten almost beyond recognition. The murder weapon, a homemade baton, was later discovered at Hick's home with his DNA on one end and Zayden's on the other. After his arrest, Hicks tried to blame the murder on another person and reportedly lied throughout investigations. Zayden was brutally murdered in his cot when he was just 10 months old . Part of Ms Veal's impact statement was read on Friday and Justice Kaye described the agony the mother would face for the rest of her life. 'I am serving a life sentence... all I have is memories and most of them are tainted by this crime,' the statement read. In an interview with the MailOnline this week, Casey said she wanted her baby boy Zayden to be remembered not as the murdered baby but as a happy boy who was taken too soon. Casey, 24, now wants her child’s legacy to be a positive one, and she is trying to combat the stigma and the silence of parents who have their children taken from them too soon. 'I want it to be at a point where it’s not weird or taboo anymore, where it’s just normal,’ she said. The mother also spoke of how the senseless unprovoked attack on her 10-month-old has affected every aspect of her and her family's life, and turned it in to a living nightmare. Hicks beat baby Zayden to death with a homemade baton during a burglary . Xavier, now nearly five, is Casey’s eldest child and was taken away from his mother by the Department of Human Services (DHS) almost immediately after his little brother’s death. 'I didn’t know what to do, because I’d had at least one child since I was 19 and I’d always had someone to look after and then it was just me again at 22,’ Ms Veal said. Detail of Hick's tumultuous upbringing including being sexually assaulted, his history of drug use and criminal record were all aired at the sentencing, and the judge said his hopes for rehabilitation were poor at best. 'There's a real need to protect the community from you.' Hicks was found guilty by a Supreme Court Jury in April. Ashely Hicks, Harley's twin brother arrived a court for his sibling's sentencing .

"By . Louise Cheer . The owners of a rottweiler cross dog were fined $10,000 after they failed to treat their dog for a skin condition that caused him to gnaw on his skin until his teeth wore down 'to the pulp'. The Balga couple were found guilty of animal cruelty in Perth Magistrates Court on Friday for the severe neglect of their dog named Snoopy that eventually claimed his life. Fly-in-fly-out worker Deborah Hayes and her partner, William John Warmdean, were hit with a $5000 fine each. Hayes was banned from owning a pet for five years. Snoopy was found in the Perth suburb of Balga in Western Australia in August last year . Warmdean was charged with the neglect because Snoopy was in his care at the time of the incident. He was also fined an extra $1000 for failing to follow directions given to him by an RSPCA inspector and slapped with a five-year probation order for severe neglect. On August 31, RSPCA inspectors first visited a Balga property after they received a complaint about a rottweiler cross dog being kept in terrible conditions. It was also reported the dog had a severe skin condition that caused him to lose almost all of his fur and was unable to stop scratching. It was found by RSPCA vets that he was suffering from a bacterial skin infection amongst other conditions . His owners were fined $10,000 on Friday at Perth Magistrates Court for neglect that caused most of his fur to fall out . When inspectors arrived they were met with potent stench and as they got closer to the dog a distinct yeast smell could be detected from metres away. Warmdean refused to surrender the dog so he was told to take the dog to a veterinarian for treatment. Two weeks later, despite repeated attempts to get the dog help, Snoopy was seized - still untreated - and taken back to a RSPCA veterinary clinic for immediate attention. RSCPA inspectors visited the property after receiving complaints from neighbours about the conditions Snoopy was living in . Unfortunately vets were unable to save Snoopy who had worn his teeth  down 'to the pulp' because of his constant gnawing of his irritated skin . It was discovered the dog was suffering from several conditions, including a severe skin condition and a bacterial skin infection that caused skin to thicken as well as scaling and crusting to his body and trunk. The only areas left untouched were his paws and muzzle. RSPCA chief inspector Amanda Swift said these conditions were treatable and could have been prevented. She labelled it as a 'disgusting case of neglect'. On approach, inspectors were met with a distinctive yeast stench when they arrived at Snoopy's home . Deborah Hayes was banned from owning a pet for five years and William John Warmdean was fined an additional $1000 as well as being slapped with five years probation for neglect . 'This poor dog had worn his teeth to the pulp from chewing his own skin given the irritation associated with the condition,' Ms Swift said. 'Several attempts were made to direct and assist the owners to fix the situation and have them seek veterinary attention but they were ignored. 'Unfortunately on this occasion, Snoopy's condition was too far advanced and we were unable to save him. 'It's disappointing to think that in today's society an animal has suffered in this unnecessary way.'","The couple from Western Australia did not seek treatment for Snoopy .

"By . Lillian Radulova . The devastated family of a man who was snatched by a crocodile in Kakadu National Park during a fishing trip last Saturday has been described as a 'hard working family man' who was 'adored by his grandchildren.' Contrary to original reports which said Bill Scott, 62, was leaning over his boat to wash a bucket at the Flying Fox waterhole, the statement said he was 'standing at the rear of his moored boat' when he was attacked and dragged into the water by a 4.7 metre long saltwater crocodile in the mid-afternoon. Scroll down for video . Bill Scott, 62, has been identified as the man who was snatched from his boat by a crocodile, in a tribute statement released by his family on Friday . 'It was fast, over in seconds and suddenly he was gone,' his family wrote. Mr Scott's remains were found inside one of two crocodiles shot dead by officers in South Alligator River on Sunday in the Arnhem Land region of the Northern Territory. 'He was a good bloke who enjoyed a good story and a laugh over a beer with his mates,' the statement said. 'A ""mad-keen"" fisherman, Bill loved nothing more than packing up the 4WD, fishing rods and heading bush with his family. He regularly visited remote locations, as well as campsites along South Alligator River for 35 plus years.' A specialist search and rescue team searched for the 62-year-old man all through Saturday and Sunday at the Kakadu National Park . The grandfather-of-four's remains were found inside a 4.7 metre long saltwater crocodile which was shot by NT police . At the time of the attack, Mr Scott's wife, son and daughter-in-law were forced to drive an hour off-track to seek help at the nearest small town, Cooinda, due to the lack of phone reception in the area. 'The family offers thanks to the kindness of the Northern Territory Police, Kakadu Rangers and Cooinda Lodge staff and many other friends and strangers who have offered assistance within their means through this difficult time,' the statement said. 'Family and friends are advised that a funeral service for Bill will be held at the Thorak Chapel on Wednesday 18th June at 2pm. 'In lieu of flowers, please donate to the Heart Foundation NT.' It is thought the man, his wife, son and daughter-in-law were in a fishing boat outside of crocodile-management zones patrolled by rangers . The man was attacked by a croc on South Alligator River while he was with his wife, son and daughter-in-law . Mr Scott was on board a boat outside crocodile-management zones patrolled by rangers when the unusual attack happened, sources say. Authorities were stunned to hear that he had been grabbed by the crocodile while on board a boat - a situation that is usually considered safe. However, tourists are warned to beware of crocodiles in any part of Kakadu as an attack is always possible. Cooinda is a popular tourist area in the heart of the World Heritage-listed Kakadu National Park - where the original Crocodile Dundee movie was shot. The tiny township is on the banks of the Yellow Water Billabong, described as one of the world's most spectacular wetlands.

"By . Leesa Smith . Children broadcasted their own impromptu late night show complete with obscenities after breaking into a radio station in a remote town in Western Australia. The youngsters, aged between eight and 14, broke into the buildings of the Wangki Yupurnanupurru community radio station in Fitzroy Crossing last week. Station manager Angie Stahl told the ABC she had previously given the children lessons in community radio, and they figured out how to make the studio broadcast live. Angie Stahl taught the children basic training which was enough for them to get on air and run their own show complete with obscenities . ‘So the cops got a call from an outlaying station ringing up to say, ‘I think you've got some kids on the radio, they're busy swearing, you'd better go bust them”. Police officers arrived a short time after the group went on air when a concerned listener called them to complain about the bad language being used. More... 'This is not f****** funny!' Karl Stefanovic calls the police on Kyle And Jackie O after week of creepy prank phone calls . 'I had never seen The Big Bang Theory, I wasn't a TV watcher,' admits Mayim Bialik as she opens up about why she returned to Hollywood after long hiatus . Ms Stahl said the children appeared to have entered through a window in her house which adjoins the studios. ‘They were making themselves at home - no damage was done, they were just hanging around the house cooking some chicken nuggets, and they dyed their hair red from some hair dye I had lying around,’ she said. ‘But after just enjoying the quiet space of the house, they found the keys to the radio studio and decided to let themselves in.’ The equipment the children used to air their show and  Ms Stahl, left with a station colleague, said she was angry at first when she discovered the children had broken into the station but now sees the funny side of it . Fortunately for the mischievous children, it was agreed between the parents and elders that they children would receive ‘sorry tasks’ instead of charged. ‘I was quite angry at the time but I'm more relaxed about it now and can see the funny side,’ Ms Stahl said. ‘Criminal charges might have had serious consequences for a couple of the kids, so we decided we could work it out amongst ourselves, and that worked out a lot better.’ Ms Stahl said the children end up with careers in broadcasting. ‘They'd come in a couple of times before to do a couple of shows and programs, so I'd taught them the basics,’ she said. ‘So it's good to see the knowledge was used correctly.’ The Wangki Yupurnanupurru community radio station is located in Fitzroy Crossing, in the north of Western Australia .","Radio station in remote Western Australia broken into by local children .

"Brazil striker Fred says he was clearly fouled in the move that led to a controversial penalty in favour of the hosts during the opening match of the World Cup. Speaking publicly for the first time after Brazil's 3-1 win on Thursday in Sao Paulo, Fred said in a video released by the Brazilian football federation that 'it was a clear penalty.' He said in the clip that 'there was a charge' by the Croatian defender on his shoulder, and that kept him from having a chance to score. VIDEO SCROLL DOWN TO WATCH CAFU DISCUSS THE REFEREE .

Pursuit: Croatia players chase after Nishimura after he points to the penalty spot as Fred remains seated on the turf . Television replays show there was minimal contact by the defender before Fred fell, but Japanese referee Yuichi Nishimura gave the penalty and Neymar converted the 71st-minute penalty to give Brazil a 2-1 lead. Neymar had earlier drawn the hosts level after Marcelo put through his own net to give Croatia a surprise early lead. Oscar added a late third to make sure of victory for Brazil but Croatia were further riled when they had a late reply disallowed after Ivica Olic was adjudged to have fouled goalkeeper Julio Cesar.

Croatia coach Niko Kovac was furious at the referee's performance afterwards, claiming he should never have been appointed to such an important fixture. 'If that's a penalty, then we can just stop playing football right now,' said Kovac after the final whistle in Sao Paulo. 'Let's play basketball instead. It's shameful. We talk about respect, but there wasn't any respect for Croatia. 'If that's how we start the World Cup, then we may as well give up and go home now.'

If someone's not up to scratch to referee the first game then find someone else. Two-and-a-half billion people saw this wasn't a penalty.' Kovac also claimed that Nishimura was a 'bad choice' for the match because he had sent off Felipe Melo in Brazil's 2-1 defeat to Holland in the 2010 World Cup quarter-final.","Brazil striker insists he was fouled by Croatia defender Dejan Lovren for crucial penalty .

"By . Sophie Borland . More than a third of adults now have borderline diabetes – caused by a rising tide of obesity, a major study shows today. Researchers calculate that 14million people in England have ‘prediabetes’ – three times the number since 2006. The group have blood sugar levels that are so high they are on the verge of suffering the full-blown illness and at a higher risk of complications such as kidney failure, nerve damage and sight problems. Scroll down for video . Growing pains:  just over half of overweight and obese adults in England have 'prediabetes', researchers have found . But because it does not normally cause any symptoms, millions are unaware they have it unless they undergo blood tests at the GP. Crucially, many could prevent both prediabetes and the full illness by making small lifestyle changes to lose weight and exercise more. Academics say that up to 10 per cent of borderline cases may now go on to develop the Type 2 version of diabetes every year, although it is not known how many will get it over the course of their lifetime. In the first study of its kind, academics from the universities of Leicester and Florida estimated the prevalence of prediabetes, defined by blood sugar levels of between 5.7 and 6.4 per cent. Diabetics are above 6.5 per cent and normal people are between 4 per cent and 5.6 per cent. Health risk: 'Prediabetics' have blood sugar levels that are so high they are on the verge of suffering full-blown diabetes . Using a sample of 20,000 adults from the Government’s annual Health Survey for England, scientists found that 35.3 per cent had prediabetes in 2011. The figure is up from 11.6 per cent in 2003, 20.4 per cent in 2006 and 32.6 per cent in 2009. They also found that just over half of adults – 50.6 per cent –who were overweight or obese had the condition. The study, published in the British Medical Journal, comes amid rising concerns over the costs of diabetes to the NHS, which spends £10billion a year – a tenth of its budget – on treatment. Because of the lack of symptoms, researchers are now urging anyone who is overweight or obese to undergo blood sugar tests with their GP. Study leader Professor Arch Mainous, of the University of Florida, said: ‘It’s very important we detect people early. Prediabetes is reversible. It’s about exercise and calorie restriction – most of these people are overweight and obese. ‘You won’t just slow the onset of diabetes, you can also go back to normal glycaemic level [blood sugar]. You can actually get back to normal. ‘What we really don’t want is people to progress to diabetes as then we are looking at higher levels of kidney disease, heart disease and eye problems.’ If the findings of the study are true for the entire population of England then more than 14.4million adults have prediabetes. Barbara Young, of the charity Diabetes UK, said: ‘Unless we make people aware of their risk of Type 2 diabetes and support them in changing their lifestyles, we could see an even greater increase in the number of people with the condition.’ Britain’s estimated 3.8million diabetics are estimated to climb to 5million by 2025 – largely as a result of obesity and the ageing population. Last month former NHS boss Sir David Nicholson revealed how he had developed the illness after years of eating fried breakfasts and binge drinking. And health service figures show that up to one in three hospital beds are taken up by diabetics. Professor Kevin Fenton of Public Health England said action from manufacturers and retailers to reduce the calories, fat and sugar content of foods could be among the ways to reverse the rising numbers of sufferers. ‘No single action will tackle this issue alone,’ he added.","An estimated 14 million people in England have borderline diabetes .

"By . Emma Innes . It was a moment his parents feared they would never see. Told he had a 10cm liver tumour which was not responding to chemotherapy, Mark and Gemma Pearson feared their son Loki would die. But to their relief, he defied expectations to survive a life-saving liver transplant and is now thriving. Loki Pearson, eight months old, was diagnosed with liver cancer when he was just five months old . Loki, now eight months old, was diagnosed with liver cancer when he was just five months old. He underwent weeks of gruelling chemotherapy before doctors decided it would not work and began searching for a donor. He underwent a seven-hour operation to replace his liver with that of a teenage boy. And a month later he is recovering well to the delight of his parents. Mr Pearson, 40, said: ‘I honestly thought I was going to lose my baby son to cancer. ‘It doesn’t even seem possible. But it’s an enormous relief that Loki looks like he’s recovering.’ Doctors told Mr and Mrs Pearson it was extremely rare for a child so young to be diagnosed with liver cancer. Mr Pearson said: ‘The doctors said it is more common when children are about three years old, but it’s near enough unheard of for a baby as young as Loki to get the diagnosis.’ Loki was found to have a 10cm tumour on his liver after his stomach swelled and he lost his appetite. He is pictured with his parents, Gemma and Mark, and his older sister, Summer . Doctors tried to shrink Loki's tumour with chemotherapy but this failed so they had to consider a transplant . Mrs Pearson, 24, said that Loki started to get unwell around Christmas time - beginning what would become a hellish few months. She said: ‘His stomach was all swollen up, he was obviously in a lot of pain and wasn’t really eating anything. ‘Loki didn’t ever seem happy either, he was always crying and seemed distressed. It was so upsetting to see your child in so much pain.’ Liver cancer is rare type of cancer that usually affects older people. Symptoms are often vague and do not appear until the cancer is at an advanced stage. They include unexplained weight loss, nausea, vomiting, tiredness and jaundice. In the UK almost 4,000 cases of liver cancer are diagnosed every year and about 70 per cent of cases are in people over the age of 65. The disease is linked to excessive alcohol consumption and to hepatitis B and C infections. Only about 10 children a year in the UK develop liver tumours. They are more common in boys than in girls. The cause of liver tumours in children is not known. The couple, from Denaby Main, South Yorkshire, took Loki to see their GP, who sent him to Doncaster Royal Infirmary. Mr Pearson said: ‘When we were at the hospital they did loads of scans on him and told us that Loki had cancer in his liver. ‘It was such a shock to hear that Loki had cancer, we couldn’t believe it - you don’t hear of babies having cancer. It was heart-breaking.’ Loki then underwent tests at both Sheffield Children’s Hospital and Leeds Teaching Hospitals before undergoing a course of chemotherapy in Sheffield. Mr Pearson said: ‘What doctors were going to do was use chemotherapy to shrink the tumour down and then surgically remove it from the liver. ‘But the tumour was about 10cm wide, which is really big for a baby. ‘The chemotherapy didn’t work, though, and the doctors told us that the tumour had not shrunk down to the size where they could remove it.’ The couple were then told that Loki would need a transplant operation to survive. A week later they were told a donor had been found and headed to Leeds only to discover the donor wasn’t a match. Mrs Pearson stayed at hospital with Loki while Mr Pearson returned home to look after their eldest daughter, Summer Rose, five, who was staying with relatives. But early the next afternoon, doctors told the parents another donor had been found. Loki (pictured with his father, Mark, after his birth) received a new liver from a teenage boy . Mr Pearson said: ‘It was a mixture of massive relief - but then the fear of losing Loki in the operating theatre kicked in. ‘We don’t know anything about the donor, apart from it was from a teenage boy and the surgeons had to trim the liver down for Loki. ‘The operation was about seven hours long. ‘When we were told everything had gone to plan, we were so happy. It was the best feeling of my life knowing Loki was well.’ Barely a month later, the couple are already noticing a difference in Loki. Loki is now recovering after his liver transplant but will need to take anti-rejection drugs all his life . Mrs Pearson said: ‘When Loki was ill, he was so pale, with black eyes - he looked like a little ghost. ‘But now he’s getting back to normal - the colour has returned to his cheeks, he’s eating, playing, laughing and giggling, it’s amazing to see him happy.’ Loki is still being monitored closely by doctors and will have to take anti-rejection drugs for the rest of his life. Mr Pearson said: ‘This whole thing has just been a living nightmare for our family. ‘But our little boy’s alive, he’s got his shot at life and we couldn’t be happier.’","Loki Pearson was diagnosed with liver cancer at just five months old .

"By . Rio Ferdinand . In one sense the World Cup is a new venture for me because I’m going to Brazil as part of the BBC team — and honoured to be doing so. I’ve spoken extensively to Gary Lineker and Alan Shearer about their TV roles and they say it’s obviously a different experience but probably the next best thing to playing. I can assure you of one thing though: I’m not quite ready to join the Lineker-Shearer retirement club just yet. I see myself as going to Rio very much as an active footballer with playing time ahead of me. Pundit: Rio Ferdinand will work for the BBC team at the World Cup this summer . Dream team: Ferdinand will work with the likes of Gary Lineker, Thierry Henry and Alan Shearer . It is feasible that in the coming weeks, perhaps even while I’m in South America, I’ll make a decision about the next stage in my career, and when that happens I’ll tell you about it. But I have options on the table from several clubs in England and overseas for next season and I’m intending to play on if the right situation arises. There is, in all honesty, nothing settled yet. Whatever I do next has to be right for me and my family and I’m going to take it one season at a time. I’m  keeping myself fit and in shape, doing my running and my workouts so I’ll be ready for whatever new club I join. In Brazil, a country I’ve never visited before, I’m sure I’ll catch up with all sorts of former colleagues and opponents now covering the game. But I also want to get out and about and explore, soak up the culture, try the food, hear the music, visit the favelas and get a proper look for myself at the other face of the carnival nation. End of the road: Ferdinand left Manchester United this summer after 12 years at Old Trafford . Finishing touches: The build up to Brazil has been overshadowed by society problems and construction delays . Brazil has its well documented social problems and I want to learn about those for myself. The poor seem to be getting poorer, and the rich richer. Thousands have been forcibly removed to make way for World Cup and Olympics projects. We need to educate ourselves on all this — and I intend to. I’ll have expert guides part of the time in the shape of the  Da Silva twins, who live in mountains outside Rio. They’re going to cook me dinner and we’re going play volleyball on their court. I’m going to beat them, obviously; they play all the time but still can’t beat my touch. The twins are expecting a crazy World Cup, crazy in a good sense, alive with noise and colour and home hopes. The further Brazil go, the  better the atmosphere will be, I’m sure.

"By . Tara Brady . Turkey's ban on YouTube has been overturned after the highest court ruled it was a violation of the country's freedom of expression. The ruling is a setback for Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan who had advocated shutting down the video-sharing website. The Constitutional Court ruled that the restrictions on YouTube amounted to a violation of constitutional rights and would notify telecommunications authorities of its decision that access should be restored, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported. Ruling is a setback for Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan who wanted to block YouTube . The restrictions on YouTube were imposed in late March after an audio recording of a government security meeting was leaked. In the recording, senior officials appeared to be discussing a possible military intervention in Syria. In April, Erdogan said he had to comply with the Turkish high court ruling to unblock Twitter but that he didn't agree with the decision. Turkey blocked access to Twitter also in March after some users posted links suggesting government corruption. Restrictions were imposed in late March after an audio recording of a government meeting was leaked . It then later blocked access to YouTube. Erdogan had vowed to 'rip out the roots' of Twitter for allowing the postings. However, the government lifted the Twitter ban, a day after the high court ruled that it violated the right to free expression. Erdogan said of the court's decision: 'I don't have to respect it. I don't respect it.' He said the court was protecting a tool of foreign influence, saying that Twitter is 'the product of an American company.' 'All of our national moral values are being set aside,' Erdogan added. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has been ordered by a judge in southern Iran to appear in court to answer complaints about the company violating privacy. Individuals say applications including Instagram and Whatsapp, a deal of which has not yet been completed, violate their privacy. It is highly unlikely that Zuckerberg would appear in an Iranian court since there is no extradition treaty between Iran and the United States. Some Iranian courts have in recent years issued similar rulings that could not be carried out.","Ruling is a setback for Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan .

"By . Oliver Wadeson . PUBLISHED: . 16:00 EST, 7 June 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 16:00 EST, 7 June 2014 . Supermodel Claudia Schiffer, TV star Lisa Snowdon and singer Paloma Faith are among  the glamorous women who have been dressed by designer and stylist Lucia Silver. So it should come as no surprise that Lucia's home is fit for a fashion queen. For a start, it's a stone's throw from Westbourne Grove in West London's ultra-trendy Notting Hill, where celebrities like to shop in the uber-chic boutiques found there. And the one-bedroom flat is on the fourth floor of a serviced apartment block - high enough up to escape  the noise and hullabaloo of the  streets below. The home of designer and stylist Lucia Silver, near Westbourne Grove, is fit for a fashion queen . Its grand, circular reception room, which features a succession of windows with 180-degree views, provides a breathtaking panorama of  the surrounding area. However, even fashionistas sometimes need to move out of town.  Lucia and her partner Peter, who is  a painter and creative consultant, and their nine-month-old son Quinn are relocating to Henley-on-Thames in Oxfordshire. Lucia is putting her flat on the rental market for £795 a week but will sell if she receives an offer in excess of £1.5 million. That might seem a lot for a one-bedroom flat,  but this is one of London's most desirable neighbourhoods and experts believe prices in the area are still going up. 'You have Queensway being completely gentrified five minutes' walk away; Portobello Market just up the road; the huge regeneration well under way in Paddington Basin;  and you're only 15 minutes from  Soho or the West End,' says Lucia. 'And on top of all that are the changes Crossrail will bring.' Lucia knows she will miss the flat - not least because she has built  her career in the ten years she has lived there. After reading English and French literature at Oxford University,  she was headhunted by advertising firm J. Walter Thompson, where  she became a European account director. She quickly realised she wanted to combine the strategic skills she was learning there with  her creative talents. Lucia Silver at her flat in West London (l) and Paloma Faith in one of her dresses (r) So in 2003 Lucia set up her own 'personal design and styling service', The L Boutique, in premises near  her flat. Recognition from magazines such as Vogue and the high priestesses of fashion journalism - Suzi Menkes, Hilary Alexander and Lisa Armstrong - soon followed. The L Boutique evolved into The State of Grace, a strictly-by-appointment studio where clients are offered London's only head-to-toe bespoke design and styling service. With Lucia's approach - 'Don't be bullied by fashion diktats... it's all theatre, so just enjoy whatever role you'd like to play and express your own style' - striking a chord, famous clients soon came knocking. Florence Brudenell-Bruce, Prince Harry's old flame, had her wedding dress designed by Lucia, while Paloma Faith used The State of Grace to dress her for her first UK tour. The design house specialises in bridalwear (Lucia was a commentator during the 2011 Royal Wedding) and the service provided is ideal for women wishing to dazzle on the  red carpet as well as at high-society social events. Lucia's talents aren't limited to the fashion world. She recently opened  a luxury boutique hotel - Dar Jaguar, in Marrakech, Morocco - which she renovated from a ruin. A romantic dark-wood bed with brass studs, and exotic embroidered cushions and ornate mirrors . Her Notting Hill flat shows plenty of evidence of a Middle Eastern influence. It is painted in sumptuous colours and there are hand-painted, crystal ruby and saffron-coloured lights from Morocco, a romantic dark-wood four-poster bed with brass studs, and exotic embroidered cushions and ornate mirrors reminiscent of the honeymoon suite at Dar Jaguar. Lucia explains that the bedroom is inspired by 'exotically oriental old-world harems'. She says it would not be easy  to make structural alterations to  the property - though she has restored a wonderful fireplace back  into working order - and it is unlikely any new occupier could improve on her stylish decor. There is a £5,500-a-year service charge, but this is quite normal  for properties of this ilk in the  area. Though there is no concierge service, the lifts are efficient and well maintained. Anna Ambrose, of agents Marsh & Parsons, says: 'Lucia Silver's flat is a special place - designed by her and with a thrilling circular reception room with great views over Notting Hill and lots of natural light. They are over-used words, but this flat is unique and is simply stunning.' Marsh & Parsons, 020 7313 6910 .

"By . Associated Press . Priceline is buying online restaurant reservation company OpenTable for $2.6 billion. The deal should help Priceline, the online travel company, branch out into a new business segment. 'Travelers are diners,' said Priceline CEO and President Darren Huston, in a conference call. ""It's the same customers. There's opportunity to cross promote brands."" Priceline will pay $103 per share, which is a 46 percent premium to OpenTable Inc.'s Thursday closing price of $70.43. Teaming-up: Priceline is buying online restaurant reservation company OpenTable for $2.6 billion . What a deal: The deal should help Priceline, the online travel company, branch out into a new business segment . Shares of OpenTable soared $33.59, or 47.7 percent, to $104.02 — above the offered price — in morning trading Friday. OpenTable seats more than 15 million diners per month at more than 31,000 restaurants. OpenTable allows users to make free reservations at restaurants through its website and mobile apps. It makes money by charging restaurants fees for the bookings. Users can also read reviews of the restaurants and view menus through the website. The table reservations company will still be based in San Francisco and will operate as an independent business led by its current management team. Visionary: Darren Huston, president and chief executive officer of Priceline.com joined Priceline in 2011 as head of Booking.com, the European unit that's fueled the company's expansion . Huston said Priceline's first goal is to expand OpenTable internationally.  Users can already book restaurants through OpenTable in London, Berlin, Hong Kong and other cities, but Huston said it wanted to bring it to more cities. Since Priceline already has 'offices in every major city in the world,' doing so should be seamless, he said. OpenTable is also working on making it easier to sign up new restaurants to its service, said Huston. The company is working on creating a cloud-based system instead of using the hardware it currently needs restaurants to install to use OpenTable. At Priceline, an average of more than 1 million guests stay in accommodations booked through one of brands each night. Expanding: Priceline is buying online restaurant reservation company OpenTable for $2.6 billion. The deal should help Priceline, the online travel company, branch out into a new business segment . It has more than 480,000 properties in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide. The Norwalk, Connecticut, company changed its name from Priceline.com Inc. to Priceline Group Inc. in April to better reflect its overall business. Its brands include Booking.com, priceline.com, agoda.com, KAYAK and rentalcars.com. Both companies' boards unanimously approved the transaction, which is targeted to close in the third quarter. Shares of Priceline rose $5.89 to $1,231.89 in morning trading.","Priceline offered $103 a share in cash for the company .

"By . Snejana Farberov . A married mother of four from Massachusetts was found lying in a pool of blood in her driveway after police say she was brutally stabbed by her husband, who yelled out, 'die, b****, die' as he was being led away in handcuffs. The Plymouth district attorney's office says police responded to calls of a stabbing in the town of Rockland Wednesday night. When officers arrived, they found 52-year-old Patricia Langley prostrate on the ground outside her Rockland home suffering from fatal knife wounds. Her husband, 56-year-old Richard Langley, was arrested at the scene after admitting to the stabbing. According to court documents, Langley told police he killed his wife for cheating on him.

The . 56-year-old father of four recounted how he returned home from a . shopping trip to Walmart Wednesday and found 'sexual' text messages on . his wife's cell phone, which caused him to fly 'off the handle.' He confronted his wife about her alleged infidelity, but she refused to address the matter, which made Langley furious, Boston Globe reported. But . during his interview with police, the man accused his slain wife of . being the aggressor, saying that she pulled a kitchen knife on him, . which he ultimately wrestled out of her grip and used to stab her at least . twice. After he allegedly . plunged the knife into Patricia Langley's chest, Richard Langley kicked . her as she lay bleeding in the middle of the driveway on a quiet . suburban street. While . neighbors who flocked to the scene after hearing Patricia’s screams used . towels to stop blood from pouring from her fatal wounds, Richard .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Sotheby's intern: Alexander Mitchell, 26, drank enough alcohol to induce a coma before swimming into the Serpentine, an inquest heard . A Sotheby’s intern who drowned in the Serpentine screamed 'I'm not going to make it' after drinking enough alcohol to induce a coma and swimming into the lake, an inquest heard. Graphics graduate Alexander Mitchell, . 26, had swam out into the middle of the lake in London's Hyde Park, . before shouting out and disappearing under the water. The inquest into his death heard how moments earlier he had been been seen doing . press-ups and making noises at the birds before stripping to his . underwear and diving into the water. Mother-of-three Alexi Merahi was with her children rowing in the lake when she noticed Mr Mitchell in the middle of the water on April 6 this year. 'As he was swimming his mouth was a bit over the water and a bit under the water,' she told Westminster Coroner’s Court. 'But he was talking about a race.' 'I don’t know exactly what race. I thought two things - one, he wanted to race me, or in fact he was within a race and it was kind of a game and that is why he was actually swimming in the water. It wasn’t clear for me exactly what he meant. 'I said to my children he wants to have a race with us, but I carried on our way - he was still moving forwards at that stage, but then at that point he said ‘I don’t think I am going to make it. I am not going to make it.' Ms Merahi told the hearing she had initially thought Mr Mitchell meant that he was not able to continue in whatever race he was talking about, but as she rowed away she saw him looking back towards the bank. She added: 'He had no sign of distress at that stage, but it did trigger in my mind because at some point I turned around and asked him if he was okay. 'At that time he wasn’t responding because he put his head under the water once, he fixed his hair, then went back a second time so didn’t answer me at all at that time. Investigation: Police cars attend the scene at the Serpentine following Mr Mitchell's death . 'But again I didn’t pick up any sign of distress at that stage - he was going under the water, coming back, fixing his hair. 'But the third time after he put his head under the water, he never came back.' The court heard she then rowed back towards where she last saw Mr Mitchell but couldn’t find him. However she noticed 'bubbles' appearing around her boat. She said she was tempted to jump into the water after Mr Mitchell, but was warned by her 15-year-old son that it was 'too cold' and she wouldn’t be able to see anything. Ms Merahi next desperately tried to raise the alarm, but said: 'Straight away I was looking for the whistle on my life jacket - I couldn’t find it.. So it went from one big frustration to another.' Another onlooker, Javier Garcia Diaz De Guerenu, had jumped into the water in a rescue attempt, before the cold water became too much. Rescue attempt: Witnesses tried to help Mr Mitchell, but were unable to save him as the water was too cold and murky . In a statement, he explained that Mr Mitchell had been 'acting strange' when he first saw him. 'He was doing press-ups and making noises towards the birds,' Mr De Guerenu said. 'He was not talking to them, but making noises.' After a quarter of an hour doing this routine Mr Mitchell, who lived in west London, undressed and ran into the water, swimming for around seven minutes before disappearing, the court was told. Mr De Guerenu said that when Mr Mitchell failed to resurface he dived in after him. He added: 'The water was very cold. I could not see him, but continued to look.' After a short time searching, the witness was so cold that he had to clamber into Ms Merahi’s boat and abandon the search. Another witness, Lucy Brantly, was jogging along the lake and had initially taken pictures of Mr Mitchell before realising the gravity of the situation. 'I took my headphones out and then suddenly realised something bad had happened, and I freaked out,' she said. Strange behaviour: Mr Mitchell was seen doing press-ups and making noises at birds on the banks of the lake in Hyde Park before he undressed and jumped in . Saying that it 'felt like ages' before emergency crews arrived, she added: 'There was a lot of fuss, but no one actually going in to try and get him.' However, the court heard that emergency services had cordoned off the area and were looking for Mr Mitchell within about 10 minutes. Mr Mitchell’s body was found by an underwater search officer, just before noon the following day, lying on his back in the silt at a depth of four metres. He had started a three month art internship at auction house Southeby's just two months before his death, after graduating from Buckingham University with a BA in graphics. Toxicology reports revealed that he had 279mg per 100ml of alcohol in his blood, at the higher end of the 200 to 300mg range that alcohol induced coma could occur. A post mortem examination gave his cause of death as cerebral oedema, and drowning as a result of intoxication. Coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox said: 'The pathologist confirms that at the time Mr Mitchell went into the water he was heavily intoxicated - 279 milligrams is within the 200 to 300mg range that is associated with coma. 'He was heavily intoxicated. The effect of which would have been such that it will have affected his behaviour.' Recording a conclusion of accidental death contributed to by intoxication, she added: 'Mr Mitchell’s death was tragic. 'He was a young man full of promise and hope, so much talent he wasted just with too much alcohol.'","Alexander Mitchell, 26, 'acting strangely' before swimming in Hyde Park .

"By . Zac Fine . Turkey has banned alcohol advertising and increased restrictions on alcohol sales today in a move likely to anger secularists who accuse the government of having an Islamic agenda. It follows the move earlier this month forbidding female flight attendants at Turkey’s national airline from . wearing red lipstick and nail polish. The sale of alcohol -  which Islam forbids followers from consuming - will be outlawed from 10pm to 6am. Alcohol producers will have to place health warnings on packaging. The law, which needs presidential approval before coming into effect, also bans alcohol-producing companies from sponsoring events. A shopkeeper displays a selection of Turkish alcoholic drinks  - which will be restricted - in his store . Turkey . has remained a secular consitution since the modernising reforms of . Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, who threw religion out of public life in the . 1920s and 1930s as he rebuilt Turkey from the ruins of the Ottoman . Empire. The powerful . military views itself as the ultimate guarantor of Turkey's secular . order and has ousted four democratically elected governments in the past . 50 years, most recently in 1997 when with public support it drove out a . cabinet it viewed as too Islamist. The . current government, led by Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, is run by the Muslim . AK party which has its roots in a banned Islamic movement. He is currently serving his third term as Prime Minister heading the . conservative faith based Justice and Development Party, also known as . the AK Party. He . founded the AK Party in 2001 upon his release from prison where the . former mayor of Istanbul, served ten months for reciting an illegal . Islamist poem during a public address in the province of Siirt. As . he was banned from public office following the speech including the . poem, he could not become Prime Minister when the party won the general . election in 2002, a ban which was lifted in 2003. However, . under Erdogan’s leadership the country has relaxed restrictions on . religious expression, including lifting the ban on head scarves in . courts and schools. Venues where alcohol is sold and consumed can no longer openly display drinks. Turkey is 99 per cent Muslim, but the NATO state and European Union candidate has a secular constitution. There have been concerns in recent years that an increasingly wealthy but pious middle-class is emerging in Turkey that wants to practise its religion more freely. Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan's ruling AK Party, which traces its roots to a banned Islamic party, has also come under strong pressure from grassroots supporters  to relax the state's control over the expression of religion. Such restrictions were aimed at reining in Islamism and improving women's rights, but effectively prevented many devout women from studying at university or taking government jobs. Mr Erdogan, whose wife Emine wears a headscarf, has previously said he is committed to secularism, but does not believe it should be at the expense of those who want to express their religious beliefs. Critics of the ruling AK Party say it is responsible for Islamism taking root in Turkey. Mr Erdogan's government denies those accusations. It says it is not trying to limit people's freedoms but aims to bring Turkey, which wants to join the European Union, up to European standards by tightening restrictions on the sale of alcohol and protecting the young. Since coming to power in 2002, the ruling party has taken various measures to limit alcohol consumption, including imposing high taxes on alcoholic drinks. National carrier Turkish Airlines has stopped serving alcohol on some domestic flights. Sales of alcoholic drinks, displayed in a shop in Istanbul above, will be banned from 10pm to 6am .

"By . Associated Press . A substance-abuse counselor who struck a pedestrian with her car and drove through a Los Angeles suburb with the dying man on her windshield has been sentenced to 55 years to life in prison. Sherri Lynn Wilkins, 53, wept as she was sentenced on Thursday after being convicted of second-degree murder, drunken driving and hit-and-run. Wilkins' blood-alcohol level was nearly twice the legal limit when she struck 31-year-old Phillip Moreno in 2012. Sherri Lynn Wilkins became emotional in court during sentencing today in Los Angeles. Wilkins, a substance abuse counselor, who struck a pedestrian with her car and drove through a LA suburb with the dying man on her windshield was sentenced to 55 years to life in prison . She drove two miles before other motorists were able to swarm her car at a traffic light and keep her there until police arrived. Wilkins, who was an addict before she became a drug and alcohol counselor, said she had been drinking that night but wasn't drunk. She was leaving a counseling center when she hit Moreno. Wilkins, 52, who was an addict before she became a drug and alcohol counselor, said she had been drinking that night but wasn't drunk. She said she had been 'self-medicating' while waiting for knee-replacement surgery and had consumed three airplane-size bottles of vodka and a can of Budweiser beer and Clamato before starting to drive. Deputy District Attorney John Harlan told jurors that after Wilkins hit Moreno, she 'drove him closer to his death'. Harlan said the force of the crash punched a hole in the passenger side of Wilkins' window and Moreno lost his shoes and pants, but still she didn't stop to render aid or call 911. Full force: Police said Moreno was still able to speak to them when he was pulled from the car windshield in 2012 . Wilkins will serve 55 years to life in prison after she struck and killed 31-year-old Phillip Moreno in 2012 . It wasn't until passing motorists . noticed the bizarre scene that they were able to swarm Wilkins' car at a . traffic light and keep her there until police arrived. 31-year-old Phillip Moreno was pronounced dead at the hospital in 2012 . Police said Moreno was still able to speak to them when he was pulled from the car windshield but later died in hospital. Wilkins testified during the trial, telling jurors the story of her addiction, . which began when she was in a car accident at the age of 15 and suffered . a broken back and shattered bones in her ankles and legs. Wilkins said . she started using heroin when it became 'cheaper than going to the . doctor'. Wilkins, who . acknowledged having served time for residential burglaries over the . years, said she kicked the heroin habit with the help of methadone and . more recently had been using medical marijuana. She told of obtaining a . degree in addiction counselling and going to work at a treatment center. Wilkins was leaving the center on the night of the crash. She . told the court Mr Moreno seemed to fly onto her car in the 2012 . incident in Torrance, but the events remained a surreal blur. Prosecutors say Mr Moreno was struck so hard that he flipped onto Wilkins' car and punched a hole in the windshield. ‘It was a flash, ‘Wilkins said. ‘I pretty much felt him landing on my window. To me, it felt like he came from the sky.’ Asked . by her attorney, Nan Whitfield, how she felt in that moment, she said, ‘Very confused, . like it wasn't real. It took me a while to figure out there was a body . on the windshield.’ ‘I didn't feel like I had hit him with my car,’ she said. ‘I felt like he fell into my windshield from up high.’ Wilkins . said she panicked and kept driving until other motorists told her to . pull over. ‘I was very scared,’ she said. ‘I kind of froze.' Wilkins was sentenced to 55 years to life after she failed to stop after hitting a pedestrian and drove with him stuck into her windshield for two miles . ‘Were you happy in November of 2012?’ asked Whitfield. ‘For the first time I was,’ she whispered and began to cry. Superior . Court Judge Henry Hall cut off further exploration of her personal . history. Wilkins is being brought to the courtroom in a wheelchair. On cross-examination, Deputy District . Attorney John Harlan asked if Wilkins thought that night she should call . her husband to pick her up since she had been drinking. ‘No,’ she said. ‘I wasn't drunk.’ Asked what she was thinking, Wilkins said, ‘I was thinking I'd better hurry up and get home before the effects hit me.’ Asked . about her lack of response afterward, she said, ‘I was freaking out. It . was not like I knew what  was happening ... I still can't believe what . happened.’ Police said Moreno was still able to speak to them when he was pulled from the car windshield but later died in hospital .","Sherri Lynn Wilkins, 53, was sentenced on Thursday after being convicted of second-degree murder .

"By . Ryan Gorman . The NFL’s first openly gay player has signed his rookie contract. Defensive end Michael Sam inked the historic multimillion dollar deal Saturday with the St. Louis Rams just over one month after the team made him the 249th overall pick in the 2014 NFL Player Draft. Sam, 24, said on Twitter that he is ‘grateful [and] humbled’ by the opportunity to sign with the team’s other 10 draft picks and play in the NFL just after agreeing to the deal. Official: Openly gay football player Michael Sam (front row, second from right) signed his rookie contract Saturday along with the St Louis Rams' 10 other draft picks . The Rams will pay Sam $2.65 million during the four-year contract, with $46,000 guaranteed, Fox Sports reported. The players were put through team-mandated financial planning education prior to being signed, according to the network. All picks agreed to deals within the slots mandated by the league for draft picks, virtually eliminating contract negotiations that led to current Rams quarterback Sam Bradford receiving a six-year, $78million contract with a nearly $18million signing bonus and $50million guaranteed after the team drafted him in 2010. ‘With the new rookie cap and everything it's really not difficult to get the deals done,’ coach Jeff Fisher explained. ‘So we just felt like this time would be better served, putting them in the situations from an educational standpoint, financial planning and those kinds of things. We've done a lot of that.’ The organization announced all the players signed in a tweet with a picture of their 11-man rookie class. On draft day: Sam smiles while sporting a Rams hat at his agent's California home shortly after being drafted . Sam followed that up by also tweeting out the same picture and writing: ‘Grateful, humbled, and motivated after officially signing with all my Rams rookie brothers. Let's do this!!’ The 2013 SEC Co-Defensive Player of the Year is believed by many to have fallen all the way to the final round of the draft because he came out during a series of interviews earlier this year. ‘I understand how big this is,’ he told ESPN in February. ""It's a big deal. No one has done this before. And it's kind of a nervous process, but I know what I want to be... I want to be a football player in the NFL.’ He was initially projected to be a third or fourth-round draftee, but tumbled to the seventh round and was selected only eight places ahead of the final pick – which is sarcastically referred to as Mr Irrelevant. The All-American famously cried, embraced and kissed boyfriend Vito Cammisano on national television shortly after his selection was announced. ‘Thank you to the St. Louis Rams and the whole city of St. Louis. I'm using every once of this to achieve greatness!!’ He wrote in a tweet that day. Despite having a dominant senior season at the University of Missouri, many scouts panned Sam’s NFL potential prior to the draft. They said the six-foot-two-inch, 261-pound player was too small to play his natural defensive end was too small to play on the line, and that he was too slow to play linebacker. If comments made during his first press conference were any indication, the criticism did little to dent Sam’s confidence. ‘I’m determined to be great,’ he said.","Michael Sam announced in February that he is gay .

She's going to tackle this like everything else she does in her life.' Speaking to the Denver Post, Rouen said the main injury was high on her back but that she had other injuries the doctors couldn't deal with initially. The couple were driving back from dinner in Show Low, Arizona on Friday when Van Dyken's ATV hit a curb and threw her down an embankment, breaking a vertebrae and severing her spine.

When help arrived, Van Dyken, 46, said she could not feel her legs and was airlifted to the intensive care unit at Scottsdale Healthcare Osborn Medical Center. 'Amy . awoke within hours of surgery acting like her typical spunky, . boisterous, ebullient self and has spent the last 24 hours entertaining . her family and her medical staff in the ICU,' her husband said in a letter shared with Swimming World Magazine a couple of days after the injury. 'She has made at least one . male nurse blush. Amy's attitude has been overwhelmingly positive and . optimistic. She has been far more of a comfort to us than we have been . to her.' The retired . athlete's family said she had severed her spinal cord and that her broken . vertebrae came within millimeters of rupturing her aorta. Their letter continued: 'Amy has a long, trying road ahead of her, but as anyone . who knows her can attest, her unparalleled mental strength and . determination will propel her. She is a fighter. 'Amy has overcome . seemingly insurmountable obstacles before, winning 6 Olympic gold medals . and becoming one of the greatest female athletes of her generation . despite battling lifelong chronic asthma.

The couple is receiving a lot of support from family, friends and fans, Rouen told the Denver Post. 'It's rough,' he said. 'But Amy is aware of the challenges ahead of her. She is ready to meet them head-on.' He told police officers that he had changed the throttle mechanism on the ATV from a thumb accelerator to a twist accelerator a few days before the accident - but he wasn't sure if it was a factor in the accident. He added that his wife had not been drinking alcohol during their dinner that evening. In a statement to Swimming World Magazine, USA Swimming said they were 'devastated' to hear about her accident. 'We're happy to hear that she escaped and is now in great care,' the statement continued.

The young friends had been heading out of their building to buy ice creams on June 1 when they were attacked. PJ's body was found inside the elevator, and Mikayla was found barely conscious outside a nearby building. She is slowly recovering from the physical injuries she suffered in the attack, and her family said she is being helped with the emotional trauma by a teddy bear that sings 'smile though your heart is aching'.

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . and Daily Mail Reporter . A champion Fijian athlete has been killed in a gang shooting in Northern California just weeks before he was set to attend a Louisiana university on a track scholarship, friends and authorities said. Roy Ravana Jr. and another man, Kevin Ohta, were shot on Monday in Sacramento County by two juveniles who opened fire with two handguns and a rifle on behalf of the Norteno street gang, prosecutors said. Ohta, 21, is expected to survive, the Sacramento Bee reported. The suspects, Elias Guevara, 17 and Rozco Gutierrez, 16, have been charged as adults with murder and attempted murder. Scroll down for video . Victim: Fijian athlete Roy Ravana Jr, 20 (pictured left and right) was gunned down in Sacramento County by two alleged gun members .

The teens were arraigned on Wednesday but did not enter pleas, said Shelly Orio, a spokeswoman for the Sacramento County district attorney's office. Deputies believe Guevara and Gutierrez are gang members, according to News10. Ravana, 20, was shot dead on Monday afternoon at the corner of 48th Street and Baker Avenue in the troubled Fruitridge neighborhood of Sacramento County. Sacramento Bee reported Guevara and Gutierrez allegedly used three guns – a .30 caliber carbine semi-automatic rifle, a 9 mm handgun and a .357 handgun – in the attack. Shell casings were found strewn across two blocks. Friends and family of Ravana say they were not aware of his involvement in any criminal behavior. Fiji's Prime Minister, Voreqe Bainimarama, called Ravana an innocent bystander and said he was a great athlete and wonderful role model. 'Many people dream of being given an opportunity to pursue success overseas,' the prime minister said in a statement. 'Roy was living that dream when he died. And many young Fijians, even those who didn't know him personally, will feel a sense of shock and loss at his passing.'

Deputy Inspector Johnny Cardona made headlines when he drove a fist into Felix Rivera-Pitre's face during a chaotic demonstration in Manhattan’s Financial District on October 14, 2011. Police accused Rivera-Pitre, who is HIV positive, of being the aggressor in the confrontation, which started when the former dancer allegedly tried to elbow the cop in the face.

One-percenter: NYPD Inspector Cardona, seen in this October 14, 2011 photo, hitting protester Felix Rivera-Pitre (green shirt) during an Occupy Wall Street has been awarded a tax-free disability pension of $120,000 a year for his injuries . Difference of opinions: The NYPD accused Rivera-Pitre of provoking Johnny Cardona by trying to elbow him in the face, but the protester insisted that all he did was give the officer 'a look' Footage from the protest shows Cardona pursuing Rivera-Pitre and then taking a swing at him, causing the passerby to crumple to the ground. However, Roy Richter, director of the Captains Endowment Association, claimed that a video shot from a different angle that day shows Cardona in a headlock and being trampled. According to the official, the deputy inspector suffered serious back injuries and required a hip replacement surgery and operations on both his knees, the New York Daily News reported. The Daily News reported that earlier this week, the NYPD pension board signed off on a disability pension for Cardona, which is three quarters tax-free and amounts to about $120,000 a year. One-time deal: Rivera-Pitre, seen  in the center during an Occupy march in September 2012, sued the NYPD and received a $55,000 settlement . Rivera-Pitre said the cop's punch tore the earring from his left ear, leaving the HIV-positive man bleeding on the ground . Rivera-Pitre has sued the NYPD and received a one-time settlement of $55,000. The man's attorney, Ron Kuby, was scandalized to learn of Cardona's pension. ‘What’s his disability?’ he asked the Daily News. ‘He hurt his fist when he punched Occupy Wall Street protesters? If he went out on a psychological disability that would have been appropriate.’ Speaking to Gothamist after the clash with police, Rivera-Pitre said that he was walking on William Street during the protest and 'shot the cop a look,' which angered the officer, later identified as Cardona, causing him to lunge at him. The fire in his belly: Rivera-Pitre, an artist and former dancer, continued participating in the Occupy movement after the 2011 incident . Cardona’s punch tore out the earring from Rivera-Pitre's left ear, leaving the HIV-positive man bleeding on the ground.

Clayton Lockett, the prisoner who was condemned to die by lethal injection in Oklahoma. He instead was not killed by the drugs for over 40 minutes . Cohen said Lockett had good veins. He said it appeared the execution team failed repeatedly while inserting an intravenous line.

'Rather, . despite the excellent condition of Mr. Lockett’s veins, the execution . team made numerous failed attempts to set an IV, eventually setting an . improperly placed and ineffective IV in Mr. Lockett’s femoral vein.' According to Cohen, placing an IV in the femoral vein, which is in the groin area, is a more painful and risky way to inject drugs intravenously. Cohen also said more information was needed to determine why Lockett died. Oklahoma officials said previously that it appeared Lockett . didn't receive a full dose of three lethal drugs. Attorney David Slane (pictured left) speaks to the media on the execution of Clayton Lockett as State Senator Connie Johnson (pictured right) listens from the Oklahoma State Capitol in Oklahoma City on Wednesday, Apirl 30, 2014.

A . six-time NBA champion with Chicago Bulls, Jordan earned fame and . fortune on the basketball court, as well as through endorsements and . movies. The . 51-year-old became the majority owner of the Hornets (formerly the . Bobcats) in 2010 when he bought out Bob Johnson's share of the team for . $175million. It . is that team, and not the various athletic gear or his infrequent film . projects that have launched him into the realm of the extremely wealthy. A . recent evaluation of the team predicted that the Hornets are worth . $410million, but Forbes states that number may be low-balling it a bit . considering the Milwaukee Bucks, long considered the least valuable team . in the NBA, sold for $550million last month. Ulitmate slam dunk: Jordan made a name for himself on the Chicago Bulls in the 1990s . Forbes' experts pits the Hornets' true value at somewhere between $600million and $625million, and once the money he has spent on the team is subtracted out from his portion of that estimate then coupled with his unrelated earnings of $600million, the total would put him just slightly above the billion-dollar mark. Technically Jordan is not the first professional athlete to reach billionaire status, but he is believed to be the only person to currently hold that title. Tiger Woods was named as the first sports star billionaire in 2009 but that came two months before news of his cheating scandal broke, which led to the loss of a number of his sponsors- and the billionaire label with it.","Jordan owns 89.5 per cent of the Charlotte Hornets NBA team which is believed to be worth more than $600million .

Emotional: Jenni Ezell (pictured holding one of her twin boys) broke down in tears after bringing her health sons home nearly 11 months after they were born . When they were born in July last year, doctors were unsure if the boys, who shared intestines and a liver, would survive. At just one-month-old, the twins underwent a risky nine-hour operation at Medical City Children’s Hospital to be separated. The boys have undergone numerous procedures and nearly two months of rehab before doctors said they could leave the hospital. 'You can never predict what can happen . but these little guys are definitely survivors,' Dr Tom Renard, the lead . separation surgeon, told ABC News. His thoughts were echoed by the . twins' parents Jenni and David Ezell, who said they were 'full of love and hope' that their boys were coming home. In their blog about the twins, the Ezells wrote of their excitement at the babies being allowed to leave.

The family . added that the twins' older brothers Ethan and Liam were also happy to have the babies home. Although the Ezell's expressed anxiety about having their twins at home after months of specialized medical care, a nurse will live with them full-time.

"By . Lydia Warren . and Associated Press . A modest one-cent stamp belonging to the late eccentric heir and famous murderer John du Pont could fetch as much as $20 million when it goes on auction in New York next week. The magenta stamp, which was used in British Guiana in 1856, has set a new world record on each of the three occasions it's been sold at auction. And when the one-square inch piece of paper goes under the hammer on June 17, it is expected to set yet another record - and earn the title of the world's most valuable stamp. It is expected to fetch between $10 million and $20 million. Costly: David Redden, Vice Chairman of Sotheby's auction house, holds up the British Guiana One-Cent Magenta stamp, which is expected to fetch as much as $20 million when it goes on auction next week . On sale: The stamp cost a single cent when it was used in British Guiana in 1856 - but it is the only one of its kind believed to exist and has set a new world record each time it's been sold at auction . As per du Pont's will, 80 per cent of the proceeds will go to . the family of his friend, Bulgarian wrestler Valentin Jordanov Dimitrov, and 20 . per cent will go to the Eurasian Pacific Wildlife Foundation, based in Paoli, . Pennsylvania, which du Pont founded to support wildlife preservation in . the Pacific. The stamp, which has rarely been seen since it was last publicly exhibited in 1986, has a rich and colorful history - starting in the hands of a 12-year-old boy before making its way to a murderer. The stamp went into circulation after a . shipment of stamps was delayed from London and the postmaster asked . printers in Georgetown in British Guiana to produce three stamps until . the shipment arrived: A 1-cent magenta, a 4-cent magenta and a 4-cent . blue. While multiple examples of the 4-cent stamps have survived, only this one cent is known to still exist. Its . first owner was a 12-year-old Scottish boy living in South America who . added it to his collection after finding it among family papers in 1873. He soon sold it for a few shillings to a local collector, Neil . McKinnon, so he could afford to buy other stamps. Owner: John E. du Pont, pictured in 1992, bought the stamp in 1980 and it is being sold off after his death . Arrest: Du Pont jumps from a police van after killing Olympic gold medal wrestler Dave Schultz in 1996 . John du Pont, a multimillionaire and chemical heir in the prominent du Pont family, was convicted in 1997 of murdering Olympic . gold medal-winning wrestler David Schultz, 36, who had been training athletes and living . at du Pont's 800-acre Foxcatcher Farm in Delaware County, Pennsylvania. His wife and children were also on the estate. Schultz's . wife and du Pont's head of security witnessed him shooting Schultz - a . long-term friend - three times on January 26, 1996. Du Pont then locked himself inside his . mansion for two days. Police . negotiated with him on the phone before switching off his power and . eventually arresting him when he ventured outside to fix his heater. No . motive was ever offered for the murder, although friends had noted was . acting erratically beforehand, and an expert witness testified he was a . paranoid schizophrenic who thought Schultz was going to kill him. Du . Pont, who was found to be mentally ill but not insane, was convicted of . murder in the third degree after the court rejected his plea of not . guilty by reason of insanity. He died of acute aspiration pneumonia in prison in 2010, aged 72. McKinnon . kept it for five years before selling it to a Liverpool dealer who . recognized the unassuming stamp as highly uncommon. He paid 120 pounds . for it and quickly resold it for 150 pounds to Count Philippe la . Renotiere von Ferrary, one of the world's greatest stamp collectors. Upon his death in 1917, the count bequeathed his stamp collection to the Postmuseum in Berlin. The . collection was later seized by France as war reparations and sold off . in a series of 14 auctions with the One-Cent Magenta bringing $35,000 in . 1922 - an auction record for a single stamp. Arthur . Hind, a textile magnate from Utica, New York, was the buyer. Among . those bidding against him was King George V. It is the one major piece . absent from the Royal Family's heirloom collection. Upon . Hind's death in 1933, the stamp was put into an auction with the rest . of his collection but was withdrawn after his widow, who claimed it was . left to her, brought a lawsuit. The . next owner was Frederick Small, an Australian engineer living in . Florida who purchased it privately from Hind's widow for $45,000 in . 1940. Thirty years later, he consigned the stamp to a New York auction . where it was purchased by an investment consortium for $280,000 - . another record. The stamp set its third record in 1980 . when it sold for $935,000 to JE du Pont, a multimillionaire and . chemical heir in the prominent du Pont family. He was convicted in 1997 of murdering Olympic . gold medal-winning wrestler David Schultz, 36, who was training and living . at du Pont's 800-acre Foxcatcher Farm in Delaware County, Pennsylvania. Killed: Du Pont, left, was found to be mentally ill when he shot dead Olympic wrestler David Schultz, left and right, at his estate. The wrestler had been training the Olympic team at the time of the killing in 1996 . Scene: Du Pont locked himself inside his mansion in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania for two days until police switched off his power and caught him when he went outside to fix a heater . 1856 The . stamp went into circulation after a . shipment of stamps was delayed from London.

June 17, 2014 The stamp will be auctioned by Sotheby's in New York, where it is expected to fetch as much as $20 million . Schultz's . wife and du Pont's head of security witnessed him shooting Schultz - a . long-term friend - three times before he locked himself inside his . mansion for two days.

Du Pont, who was found to be mentally ill but not insane, was convicted of murder in the third degree after the court rejected his plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. He died of acute aspiration pneumonia in prison in 2010, aged 72. Du Pont had exhibited the stamp for the last time in Perth, Australia in 1987. Afterwards, the stamp was returned to him on a Sunday and he did not have access to a bank vault until the next day - so he slept with it beneath his pillow. An 1855 Swedish stamp, which sold for $2.3 million in 1996, currently holds the auction record for a single - but Sotheby's believes the magenta could go for much more. The stamp arrived with David Redden, director of special projects for Sotheby's, at the Smithsonian museum in April. He carried the stamp in a briefcase and was accompanied by an armed guard. 'It was very, very interesting,' Thomas Lera, the chair of research at the . Smithsonian National Postal Museum who examined the stamp for Sotheby's, told The News Journal. 'You always want to see for yourself. You look at the stamp and you say to yourself, ""I actually thought you . were bigger,"" and you realize you were looking at enlarged pictures.' Lera . was not allowed to touch the stamp, which was removed from its frame . inside the case with tongs and placed under special lights, the News . Journal reported. Where will the story go next? The stamp was initially discovered in 1873 by a 12-year old Scottish boy living in British Guiana, South America who sold it to a local stamp collector for several shillings . Lera said he was struck by the initials of the various owners' imprints, which start with Philipp de la Rénotière von Ferrary's purple trefoil and end with 'JEdp' - for du Pont - written in pencil. Doug Gaul, an appraiser at Dutch Country Auctions, said whoever purchases the stamp will be buying a story rather than an object of intrinsic value. 'As far as stamps go, it's not a particularly attractive stamp,' he said. 'But it's such an aura, such a story, it's like a pot of gold. The person who wins that gets to be part of that story, and gets to add his name to that story.' The stamp is the only major stamp absent from the British Royal Family's private Royal Philatelic Collection. 'This is the superstar of the stamp world,' said Redden.","One-cent magenta stamp was made in British Guiana in 1956 when a shipment of stamps from England were delayed .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Billionaire oil tycoon William 'Bill' Koch has revealed he splashed out about $5 million on rare French wines which turned out to be fake. Many of the counterfeits were produced by convicted fraudster Rudy Kurniawan who re-marked bottles of cheap wine with photocopied labels of top vintages. 'I just had to have them,' Koch, 74, told ABC News' 20/20 program. 'Then I’d open it up and . drink it and it was dish water or moose piss.' Ripped off: Billionaire William Koch, 74, has admitted he spent $5 million on counterfeit wines . Koch, an avid wine collector, admitted he bought about 500 bottles at up to $100,000 each, thinking they were from the finest French chateaus. Although he said there would be little sympathy for a wealthy person who'd been conned, Koch choked up while describing the debasement of 'the art, craftsmanship' of fine wines being faked. Koch, who lives in a waterfront mansion in Florida, is estimated to worth $4 billion from oil and other investments. 'I cannot stand to be cheated,' Koch told 20/20. 'I want someone to know they sell me a fake, . man, I’m coming after them no matter how much it costs.' Koch, whose twin brother is billionaire David Koch, has spent millions on lawyers and private detectives to expose the fakes. Koch’s team worked with the FBI, and he agreed to testify against Kurniawan at his criminal fraud trial. Convicted: Rudy Kurniawan (pictured) conned savvy, competitive rare-wine collectors, with the biggest hoax in history taking place right under their noses . Fake labels: When the FBI arrested Mr Kurniawan, his Californian home contained explicit evidence of the scam, including thousands of photocopied wine labels and used corks . Fraud: Investigators found detailed instructions for fabricating labels as well as sealing wax and rubber stamps with vintages at Rudy Kurniawan's California home . Rudy Kurniawan took the wine world by storm by claiming he had access to wines many thought had long since disappeared. Many experts gave his vintages glowing reviews. But the Indonesian-born conman slipped up when he tried to sell fakes purportedly from France’s Domaine Ponsot at a New York auction. When the FBI raided Kurniawan’s California home in March 2012, they discovered he created his fine vintages in his kitchen, attaching photocopied labels from top producers to bottles of cheap Napa Valley wines. Kurniawan’s lawyer, Jerome Mooney, said his client is sorry for what he did but that the harm to wealthy collectors such as Koch was minor. 'Nobody was hurt by this, absolutely nobody was hurt by this,' Mooney told 20/20. 'It not that it’s less of a crime but that it’s less of an impact.' Kurniawan was convicted in December and will be sentenced on July 17.","William 'Bill' Koch, 74, was cheated out of $5m on rare vintages .

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Associated  Press Reporter . A 9-year-old New Mexico girl who went missing Friday in a northern California park was found the next day after spending the night in the woods, authorities said. Ida Rothschild, from Sante Fe, disappeared after she wandered away from her family's campsite was found unharmed by a bicyclist crying for her mother. The girl was lost for nearly 24 hours before being found by the cyclist. Her father said it was the 'best Father's Day gift ever,' according to KGO. Happy family: Ida Rothschild, far left, is shown with her family shortly after being found . Two people on mountain bikes who had joined the intensive search for Ida Rothschild of Santa Fe, N.M., located the girl Saturday morning in Samuel P. Taylor State Park after hearing her calls for help from a hillside, according to KTVU. They heard Rothschild crying and ran to her aide, she wanted her mother. The good samaritans gave her water and called 911. The trio waited for about 30 minutes until help arrived. 'She was in good spirits,' a police spokesperson said. 'She said she was hungry.' Rothschild was soon reunited with her mother. 'Ida, where have you been?' The woman half-jokingly asked as tears of joy and relief streamed down her face. 'Mom, I'm fine,' Ida replied. Safe and sound: The nine-year-old girl told her mother she was 'fine' when seeing her again Saturday morning . Massive search effort: Posters went up all over the park and surrounding area as hundreds joined the search effort . The search had as many as 200 people at one point. This time, it had a happy ending. Rotschild's mother explained to local media that her daughter said she walked all night trying to reach her family and didn't know so many people were looking for her. 'She said she lost track of where she was' the spokesperson said. 'She could no longer see the campground.' Rothschild was found about 2.5 miles away from the campsite. More than 100 sheriff's deputies, search and rescue workers from neighboring counties, California Conservation Corps members and volunteers worked through the night looking for the girl. Divers were also brought in to search the camp's ponds and creeks, according to KTVU, but they thankfully went unused. Unscathed: The young girl had no injuries and complained only of being hungry when she was found by two bicyclists . 'Thank you for saving me, everybody who worked hard to save me,' the grateful girl said. 'Thank you to everybody who looked for me and how much devoted they were.' The family was visiting the park with her parents and two younger brothers Friday afternoon when she disappeared. Another hundred had resumed the painstaking search early Saturday, along with search dogs and an airplane. It was the largest search for a missing person in Marin County in seven years. Her parents reported her missing after spending 90 minutes looking for her. Her father had last seen her about noon Friday and realized she was gone about half an hour later. An official spoke glowingly about the positive outcome to throngs gathered at the camp. 'We've had some that ended differently,' he said. 'It's good this had a different outcome.'","Ida Rothschild and her family, from New Mexico, were camping in a northern California park when she went missing .

"By . Patricia Kane . More than 1,000 passports could be issued to ‘suspect’ overseas applicants because staff are not carrying out standard checks due to the huge backlog at the Passport Office. These documents could be issued within the next fortnight, sources within Her Majesty’s Passport Office (HMPO) claim, despite Home Secretary Theresa May’s vow that security would not be compromised. The security loophole has been exposed after staff in the HMPO’s ‘Special Security Division’ were diverted to help clear up the chaos elsewhere. Passport applications awaiting to be processed at an office in Liverpool due to a massive backlog . These highly trained officials are usually responsible for carrying out multiple fraud checks on documents sent in with overseas applications. The problem is being compounded by the drafting in of inexperienced staff who are unable to spot suspicious answers on applications and alert the Special Security Division. A source told The Mail on Sunday: ‘All hands are being called to the pumps and the Security Division is now like one man and a dog for the rest of the month with the majority of staff transferred to other duties. ‘The Security Division estimates that within the next couple of weeks, because of this panic, there will be at least 1,000 “unsecure” passports issued to “suspect” persons.’ Last week, Theresa May confirmed that responsibility for dealing with applications for passports overseas had switched three months ago from British consulates abroad to an online system based in the UK monitored by HMPO. She said the change was made to provide better value for money and to ensure more ‘consistency’ of service. She stressed that security would not be compromised. But the HMPO source added: ‘At one of the major Passport Office hubs, in Glasgow, they’ve now been lumped with passport applications from every registry throughout the world, which have to be checked, double-checked and triple-checked. The Security Division handles the potentially fraudulent applications and subjects them to rigid scrutiny. Home Secretary Theresa May has vowed that security will not be comprised while the passport application backlog is tackled . ‘There is a template system in place to sift suspicious applications which Passport Office staff have been trained to recognise. ‘But the Government is drafting in inexperienced Border Agency staff to help. The problem is that they will not recognise certain key answers that would alert full-time staff.’ The Security Division was set up after it was discovered ‘bulk’ applications mainly by Eastern European gangsters were being made for British passports and a small number had been processed. As the Glasgow team picked up on the problem, it was decided to base the unit there. Last week, leaked documents from the HMPO revealed a plan to ‘relax’ checks on applications from overseas. The Home Office said it had been ‘unaware’ of the proposed change and ordered the guidelines to be withdrawn. An HMPO spokesman said: ‘Security is our priority and we will not issue a passport until all  necessary checks have been satisfactorily completed.’ Meanwhile, civil servants at HMPO received bonuses worth more than £1.8 million last year, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. The bonuses were paid out to thousands of employees for ‘good performance’ at the service, which now has a backlog of 500,000 applications. More than 94 per cent received the ‘in-year’ bonus, supposed to be handed out to staff who have exceeded ‘key business targets’. Sarah Rapson, the former chief executive, received a bonus worth between £5,000 and £10,000 in 2012/13. On Tuesday the current chief executive, Paul Pugh, will go before the Home Affairs Select Committee to face questioning over the crisis. Keith Vaz, the chairman of the committee, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘It is unbelievable that bonuses have been paid to those who have presided over a service that is now a byword for incompetence.’","Staff from 'Special Security Division' drafted in to help process passport applications .

"By . Kirk Maltais . A 16 year old who is accused of killing his father with a cane and hiding the body in a backyard compost bin was charged as an adult in the crime on Friday. Rylan Salzman, from Tacoma, Washington, plead not guilty to one count of second-degree murder in the death of his father, Richard Salzman. Richard Salzman, 49,  was reported missing last Saturday by his wife, Louise Salzman. The last time he had been seen was the day before. Scroll Down for Video . Rylan Salzman (pictured left) walking into court on Friday. The 16-year old plead not guilty to the murder of his father Richard Salzman (pictured right) 'This is a strange case of patricide,' Prosecutor Mark Lindquist told KOMO News. ""The motives are still being investigated."" According to police, Rylan killed his father after the two parents had engaged in an argument over the phone. Rylan was at home with Richard who had been drinking. In a call to 911 that Tuesday, Rylan claimed that the altercation took place when he confronted his father about the argument. Richard became upset, and pushed his son to the ground. That's when Rylan picked up the cane and struck his father repeatedly with it, killing him. Before admitting to 911 that he had committed the crime, Rylan had told his mother that his father had gone on a bike ride that evening, and had never returned. Louise Salzman, who had been staying at a family member's home, filed a missing person's report the next day. By Tuesday, she began getting a search party together.

"By . Jonathan Petre . For months the art world has breathed a collective sigh of relief as they have been spared the withering pronouncements of Britain’s leading art critic. Now Brian Sewell has spoken for the first time of the cancer that has led to his absence from public life – and revealed how an operation to remove the tumour left him with what he calls ‘my Picasso ear’. And as he recovers from surgery, Mr Sewell, 82, has lost none of his feared acerbic wit, taking aim at Tate director Sir Nicholas Serota and labelling famed art historian Lord Clark a ‘fraud’. Brian Sewell has spoken for the first time of the cancer that has led to his absence from public life . In an operation last week, Mr Sewell had his right ear virtually removed and then re-attached so the tumour could be taken out, leaving him with a ‘disconcerting’ feeling. ‘It feels to me as though it is slightly misplaced,’ he said, jokingly likening it to the way Picasso rearranged features in his Cubist portraits. Mr Sewell said he first noticed a ‘small and squishy’ lump behind his ear in January, but ignored it. But after it grew increasing painful, he went to his GP and was referred to specialists at the Royal Marsden hospital in Fulham, West London. Doctors found what he called a ‘tiresome’ tumour in his neck, and initially believed it could easily be removed. But after further tumours were found in his lungs and ‘what they rather vulgarly called my gut’, a planned operation was delayed, and he feared he was facing ‘the kiss of death’. At one stage, he believed his condition was inoperable and terminal. But he did not contemplate suicide – despite an article he wrote for The Mail on Sunday last year, in which he had endorsed assisted suicide for those with terminal conditions and said he might one day take ‘pills and gin’ to take his own life. His surgeon then decided he could operate, but warned of what Mr Sewell calls the ‘ghastly prospect’ that they might sever his facial nerve and leave him badly disfigured. Happily, the operation was successful. Although Mr Sewell now faces months of radiotherapy, he said he is now ‘relieved, ebullient and hugely grateful’ that ‘my life has been given back to me’. 'Picasso Ear': The artist's portrait of a jug-eared Angel Fernández de Soto . His sense of mischief is undimmed as he teased enemies such as the Tate’s Sir Nicholas, whom he has repeatedly vilified for championing modern art. Mr Sewell joked: ‘The one consolation I have is that I have frustrated the Serota Tendency by surviving the operation. I have not gone yet.’ He also described attending the Tate Britain exhibition Kenneth Clark: Looking For Civilisation, and declared: ‘I thought what an old fraud this man was. He had absolutely no eye. It aroused my anger, which is perhaps a healthy thing.’ Speaking from the South London home he shares with his beloved dogs Lottie and Gretel, Mr Sewell said the operation had left him with vivid scars around his ear and down his neck. ‘It looks pretty vile,’ he admitted. ‘It looks like we are in the 15th Century and the Tower of London and someone has attempted rather badly to chop my head off. I have the feeling that there are lots of tiny men surrounding my ear who are tugging it to try to get it back to where it should be.’ He also insisted that his brush with death had not changed his approach to art: ‘I don’t feel that because I might be dying I should be charitable.’ With his thoughts turned towards mortality, he has considered what will happen to his body after death. ‘I wish I could leave it to Pedigree Chum,’ he said. ‘I really don’t see why dog lovers shouldn’t end up as dogs’ dinners.’","Brian Sewell has spoken for first time since operation to remove tumour .

"By . Damien Gayle . Siberian villagers were left stunned when a flood washed what appears to be a piece of inter-continental ballistic missile onto their doorsteps. The fibreglass cylinder floated into the garden of a traffic policeman after floodwaters inundated the village of Malougrenyevo in Altai, Western Siberia. After villagers took photos and circulated them online, speculation grew that the tube could be part of a spaceship fallen to Earth, or even an ICBM that had been decomissioned and buried nearby. Scroll down for video . Surprise: The cylinder which washed up in a Siberian village, panicking locals who feared it might be radioactive . As fears began to mount that it might be radioactive, a general consensus emerged that it must be dangerous and that authorities would move quickly to hush up the blunder. But RT, the Russia's state-backed international news network, reported that the truth was somewhat more mundane. It quoted Alexei Yaskin, professor of aero-space engineering at Biisk Technology University, as saying the cylinder was indeed probably a relic of Russia's space industry, albeit one that never made it off the planet. 'That this is an empty body of a rocket engine, presumably left from the Soviet times on the territory of the Biysk chemical plant,' he said. 'As it's an empty body with no fuel in it, it poses neither public nor technical danger. 'Such tanks may be handy in households as water collecting and storage containers, or - if dug into the ground - can be used as a sewerage facility.' His explanation was backed by a local . government official, who said that a family living close to . Malougrenyevo had had been using it to store water. The . chemical plant in Biysk, Altai's second largest city, had previously . used such tanks as containers for rocket fuel, RT reported. After demand . dropped with the fall of the Soviet Union, there were plenty of tanks . left spare. Officials say it is a relic of the space industry, but was left spare when local enterprises shut down in the 1990s . Nikolay Dochilov, deputy chief of the Federal Scientific and Manufacturing Centre in Altai told Itar-Tass the rocket part was made of carbon fibre-reinforced polymer. He said: 'It is a legacy of of an enterprise closed at the beginning of the 1990s that specialised in filling the shells with fuel. 'We did had an enterprise that specialised in filling those missiles, which were produced at Dnepropetrovsk in Ukraine. The rockets were decommissioned in 1992-93 and then scrapped. Several of the shells were left, but since they were never filled with fuel they were safe and people took them home. 'We sent a member of staff to go and double check that there is no danger, and he confirmed that this is just an empty shell that has never been filled with fuel and therefore is not dangerous. Nor is there any issue of secrecy here.' Tatyana Zhdanova, whose family owns the tube, told Sibnet.ru that they had bought the tube from the plant. She said it got away during the flood. 'It broke the fence and floated away with the dogs, who were hiding inside,' she said, adding that now it has become famous they may now auction it off.","Mysterious cylinder appeared during floods in Altai, Western Siberia .

"By . Chris Pleasance . A serial rapist in Russia suspected of committing more than 100 rapes in his lifetime has told police he treated himself to women for his birthday. Valery Makarenkov, 67, was caught last month after a reign of terror in Moscow which lasted nearly 30 years. Wearing a mask to hide his identity, he would strangle his victims until they lost consciousness before raping them and stealing their money and valuables. Now Makarenkov has told officers investigating his horrific crimes: 'I gave myself these girls as a birthday gift.' Scroll down for video . Valery Makarenkov, 67, who is thought to be behind at least 108 rapes in Moscow over 27 years, has told police he 'gave myself these girls as a birthday gift' Despite Makarenkov using the same technique for all his crimes, and them all happening around his birthday on May 27, police were unable to track him down until now . Despite using the same modus operandi, . and the fact that all the attacks took place in the two months around . his birthday on May 27, local police never got on the trail of the . serial rapist. Makarenkov . was only caught after attacking a 29-year-old woman who was able to . fight him off and lift his mask in order to look at his face. After escaping the attack, the woman . alerted police nearby who tracked him down and arrested him, after the . woman later identified him. Makarenkov was caught last month after a 29-year-old woman was able to fight him off as he tried to strangle her before pulling off his mask . 'Old age finally caught up with him and he was unable to complete the act, as his victim was able to beat him off,' said a police spokesman. The first reported incident was during the years of Communism but the victim is only now set to find closure. The exact number victims is still not known, but it is believed he has raped at least 108 women during the last 27 years. When the husbands, fathers and brothers of the women whose lives were changed forever, found out that the criminal was caught, they gathered outside the courthouse where he was detained. According to police , the crimes were not planned. Makarenkov acted spontaneously, depending on the situation. He had no preference in the age or the social status of the women - he only cared that they would not be able to resist. Investigators were able to . establish the involvement of Makarenkov in numerous crimes, some of them . through DNA. The most recent victims were also able to identify him. In . the years leading to Makarenkov's arrest, detectives studied . some of the suspect's handwriting and compiled a list of around 20,000 . Moscow residents who bore resemblence to the suspect's description. 'After . several years of hard analytical work, Valery Makarenkov, who was born . in 1947, was detained,' Vladimir Markin, a spokesman for Russia's . Investigative Committee, said. 'According . to investigators, in the period from 1987 to 2014, he carried out a . series of attacks on women in Moscow that were associated with . robberies.' Final crime scene: Makarenkov was arrested after he allegedly tried to rape a 29-year-old woman in Kuzminki Park (pictured) Police say Makarenkov didn't targeted women who would be easy to subdue, acting spontaneously . Investigators say many of the attacks followed a specific 'modus operandi' in which Makarenkov would pose as an ordinary cyclist late at night or early in the morning. He would follow his victims in Moscow parks or in the backyards of apartment buildings, where he would choke the women unconscious and rape them before stealing any valuable possessions they were carrying. 'Thanks to the modern high-tech equipment of the Russian Investigative Committee's Main Criminalistics Department, a rapid molecular-genetic study of the suspect's DNA samples allowed investigators to quickly establish his involvement in 19 crimes,' Markin explained. 'The young woman who was attacked three days earlier confidently identified the suspect.'","Serial rapist Valery Makarenkov, 67, was caught in Moscow last month .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Spanish thug who pushed Scottish holidaymaker Stephen Mallon to his death during an anti-British mob attack abroad has been jailed for just three years. Jose Ivan Jimenez Martin, 28, was facing a 15-year jail sentence if he had been found guilty of homicide. But he was cleared of that charge and was instead convicted of the father-of-three’s manslaughter after a judge ruled he had provoked Mr Mallon’s fall from a 13ft ledge during a mass attack by a gang of Spaniards armed with weapons. Jose Ivan Jimenez Martin, right, was convicted of Stephen Mallon's manslaughter, left, more than four years after the 49-year-old father of three fell was pushed to his death following a fight in Competa, near Malaga . Mr Mallon died after being attacked outside 'La Estrella' bar in Competa, near Malaga, pictured . Roofer Mr Mallon, 49 and originally from Glasgow, died in hospital 11 days after suffering severe head injuries in the summer 2009 fall in Competa, near Malaga, where he owned a holiday home. His sons Peter and Carl, who were 16 at the time, suffered broken bones after being punched and attacked with a metal pole and were left with post-traumatic stress caused by their ordeal. Two other men were found guilty of assault with dangerous weapons in a 31-page written document released by Malaga’s Criminal Court number three yesterday. Mrs Mallon's widow Teresa, right, along with her daughter Jenny, left, attacked the sentences describing them as 'disgusting' claiming her family has also been let down by British diplomats and UK police . Luis Felipe Romero Allsop, convicted of hitting Carl Mallon with a metal bar and fracturing his right hand, was sentenced to two years in prison. Juan Ortega Gonzalez, who prosecution lawyers wanted jailed for five years for smashing a bottle over Mr Mallon’s head, also received a two-year jail sentence. The pair may escape going to jail, because in Spain prison sentences of two years or less are normally suspended for first-time offenders who pay compensation orders linked to their convictions. Ten of the 12 other defendants tried last month over the orgy of violence that led to Mr Mallon’s death were fined after being convicted of affray. Two were cleared. Last night, Mr Mallon’s widow Teresa criticised the sentences. She said: ‘They’re disgusting to be honest. We will be reviewing the sentencing document to see where we go from here.’ Fifteen Spanish men took the witness stand as defendants in a five-day trial which finished on May 26. Mr Mallon’s sons said when they gave evidence they were attacked by up to 40 men armed with coshes, knuckledusters, bottles and iron bars outside a disco-bar called La Estrella, simply because they were British. The defendants denied the claims and insisted they acted in self-defence after the Mr Mallon started attacking them. Some witnesses said the trouble kicked off over a girl who used to date one of the accused.Jimenez, accused of wilfully killing Mr Mallon, insisted when he took the witness stand he had only moved his arms about trying to defend himself after the Scot punched him. Lead judge Andres Rodero, one of three . who presided over the trial, concluded in the written ruling: ‘We . believe there is sufficient proof in relation to the origin of the fall, . in the sense that it was provoked by the accused and not the result of a . simple loss of balance.’ The . sentencing judges also ordered him to compensate Mr Mallon’s . hairdresser widow Teresa with 120,000 euros (£96,000) and his three . children with 90,000 euros (£72,000) each. The ten men convicted of affray will have to pay 10 euros (£8) a day over four months and face prison if they fail to do so. Mr Mallon, pictured right, was attacked with his sons, from left, Peter and Carl, who suffered broken bones, also pictured is Mr Mallon's daughter Jenny . Teresa . who has still not been able to cremate or bury her husband, said on the . last day of the hearing last month she felt let down by the lack of . support from British diplomats and UK police. She . added: ‘We would be worried for anyone who went to Competa for a day . because they could be attacked by a mob of 30 armed men.’ The . charge of homicide in Spain is a halfway house between manslaughter and . the more serious charge of murder and carries a ten to 15-year prison . sentence. Under Spanish law murder, like homicide, is a wilful killing but it must also be premeditated.","Stephen Mallon died 11 days after being attacked outside late-night bar .

"Feel like you're stuck behind your desk? It seems you're not alone. Unpaid overtime has become a fact of life for one in four British employees, who clock up at least seven hours over their contracted working time each week. The culture of staying late has become so common that more than a third of those questioned in research by health insurer AXA PPP said they felt guilty if they left the office on time. Stressed workers feel they may lose their job if they do not agree to work extra hours, file picture . Too much work was given as the main reason for doing overtime, with 40 per cent citing it, while 20 per cent said they stayed late because of pressure from colleagues. More than one in 10 (11 per cent) of those workers questioned said they remained in the office because they were afraid they might lose their job if they didn't clock up extra hours. While businesses might be feeling the benefits of employees' extra efforts now, the study authors warned they could be doing long-term harm. Dr Mark Winwood, director of psychological services at AXA PPP, said: 'It's concerning to see so many people working extra hours due to pressures in their workplace. 'If a business encourages a culture of long hours where workers feel they need to stay late, they may be doing themselves a disservice. 'Protracted working hours can dent an employee's productivity and even lead to burnout. This is an issue employers would be wise to address.' One in ten workers admits to working through their lunch according to a survey by insurer AXA PPP, file photo . He warned that employers also have a legal duty of care to safeguard the health and well-being of their staff and therefore should ensure that they have a clear policy on overtime and make sure workers follow it. 'Employers should also invest in ensuring that staff know what support services are available to help them if they are struggling to manage the pressures in their lives, whether at work or at home - for example, confidential counselling helplines,' said Dr Winwood. 'If not, they may find themselves on the receiving end of a work-related personal injury claim and/or up before an employment tribunal. 'Overtime is too often worn as a badge of honour and seen by employees as a requirement for success. Senior management has a critical role to play in challenging this widely held view and, by demonstrating strong leadership, can help to foster a workplace culture where employees are treated fairly and greater emphasis is placed on effective performance management rather than on simply being seen to be putting in long hours.' The study of 2,000 employees found that less than half of those doing overtime get paid for it and that one in ten staff work through their lunch.","One-third of British workers feel guilty if they leave the office on time .

"By . Corey Charlton . They say an Englishman’s home is his castle and for the princely sum of £250,000 you could make it a reality. An incredible property that looks like a miniature castle has come on the market - for just that sum. The Grade II listed building, located in Whitley Bay, Tyne and Wear, was erected in 1720 and features an amazing turret that boasts countryside and harbour views. It was originally used as a watch tower and the rest of the building was used as an office by the harbour master. The building, which was converted to residential use about 70 years ago, was built around 1720 and it is known locally as the Tower House or the Octagon . Although the building doesn't quite offer the same space a true castle would, its battlement style parapets and medieval-type features will be sure to attract history fans . The tiny urban castle, listed for £250,000, boasts four bedrooms, an open plan kitchen, a spacious living room as well as views for miles on a clear day . Although experts are unsure how long the ancient building was used by the local port authority, it is believed that around 70 years ago it was converted for residential use. The building boasts four bedrooms, an open plan kitchen and dining room, and a spacious living room. It also has a yard at the back and is just a stone’s throw away from the stunning coastal walk surrounding Colywell Bay. Don't let its modern interior fool you - the two storey building also has a turret on the second level, from where you can stand and look out across the neighborhood . The turret was originally used as a watchtower looking over the surrounding countryside while the rest of the building was used as the harbourmaster's office . The property is being sold through Next2Buy estate agents who are based in Tyneside. Karen Blight, sales negotiator at Next2Buy, said: 'This property was built around 1720 and it is known as the Tower House or the Octagon. 'It was built to look out to sea and it was designed by architect John Vanbrughand. It was used as a small harbour office. 'It has been used for residential purposes for the last 70 years or so but unfortunately we do not know much else about the history of it. 'The most exciting part of the property would be the fantastic view, it’s a beautiful location and when it is clear you can see for miles. 'The turret is accessible and would be a perfect place to stand or sit and look out at the beautiful views, it would be like having your own castle. The building isn't expected to be big enough for a family, but it does fit in a narrow utility room, left, while the view of the nearby channel is one of winding hills and water . 'The house is two storeys high and has three to four bedrooms in the basement area, one bathroom, a living room and an open plan kitchen and dining room. 'What’s interesting about the building is that the whole world has changed around it but it has remained exactly the same after all these years. 'I don’t think it would accomodate a family because it is too small but it would be ideal for someone who is quite passionate about the Northumberland coast.'","The property, built in 1720, features an old fashioned turret with views across the nearby countryside and harbour .

"By . Kieran Gill . Vicente del Bosque has demanded a reaction from his Spanish side after the world champions were humbled 5-1 by Holland in their World Cup opener. Del Bosque's side, in a replay of the 2010 final, looked a shadow of their usual selves after going ahead in the 26th minute with a Xabi Alonso penalty. But Robin van Persie and Arjen Robben got two apiece before Stefan de Vrij sealed it with a fifth as the Netherlands put FIFA's top-ranked team to shame.

Del Bosque, though, refuses to accept the top spot in Group B is done and dusted just yet, and knows that is the nature of the game. 'It's sport, we lost. It is necessary to accept defeat,' he told Tele 5. 'We must recognise our mistakes, but everyone fought for a better result. 'I am aware that it is a very delicate time for us. 'Together we have to try to solve it for the next match against Chile and look for the win.' Del Bosque then suggested David Silva's missed chance - an audacious chip from the Manchester City midfielder - before Holland's equaliser was crucial to the match. 'They played better in the second half, but we dominated in the first and went from possibly 2-0 possible with Silva to 1-1 immediately,' he said.

"By . Paul Bentley . Up and down the country, families hit by the passport crisis have been left wondering whether they will be able to take their holidays. But these civil servants – including a number from the Home Office – had no such worries as they enjoyed a taxpayer subsidised yachting trip. Drinking heavily and racing each other in top-of-the-range boats, the 128 staff from a range of government departments and agencies took part in a six-day ‘team building and bonding’ regatta on the Isle of Wight. Drink up: Bottles of spirits can clearly be seen as crew members celebrate aboard one of the 36ft yachts on the Isle of Wight . The trip, branded a ‘taxpayer-subsidised booze Armada’, even saw a number of officials from the Ministry of Defence enjoying duck terrine and roast lamb on Thursday – as it was announced that more than 1,000 troops were being made redundant. Some civil servants boasted that they were paid to be there and joked on social networking sites that it was just another ‘hard day at the office’. They said they had been granted taxpayer-funded ‘special paid leave’, usually reserved for family bereavements. The £27,319 cost of chartering the yachts was subsidised by a civil service sports group which received £600,000 this year from the Cabinet Office. Last night, politicians and taxpayer groups expressed outrage that the event was allowed to take place at all at a time of cuts – and particularly when the Passport Office faces immense pressure from the public to clear its backlog. They said the civil servants should be made to repay any public funds they received for the work holiday. Making heavy weather of it: Crew from the Meteorological Office race in a top-of-the-range boat . Wind in their sails: Yachts jostle for position at the taxpayer-funded regatta . Tory MP Douglas Carswell said: ‘It is lucky their jolly jaunt wasn’t overseas or they would have had trouble getting their passports in time. ‘This is further evidence that the Whitehall machine is run for the convenience of those who work there rather than the taxpayer.’ Paul Flynn, Labour MP for Newport West and a member of the public administration committee, said: ‘There is no justification for a taxpayer subsidised booze armada. ‘On the one hand there are fanatical reductions in the civil service – but on the other there is this spending on sinful and self-indulgent jaunts.’ Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, added: ‘This is a shocking waste of money. There’s plenty of important work to do in Whitehall, and none of it is going to get done while mandarins are relaxing on yachts.’ The Civil Service annual Inter Departmental Offshore Regatta ran for six days from Sunday and featured 17 eight-person yachts, including three from the Ministry of Defence. Officials from the Home Office, Meteorological Office, National Crime Agency, Department for Work and Pensions and Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs also took part. Cheers! Civil servants clutching bottles of beer during the six-day taxpayer subsidised trip . The regatta culminated on Thursday with a three-course meal at a prestigious sailing club. Wearing official T-shirts printed specially for the trip, the civil servants ate and drank copious amounts of alcohol in a marquee overlooking the sea, while served by a team  of waitresses. Soon after collecting the 36ft yachts on Sunday, members of the MoD team from the UK Hydrographic Office posted photos of themselves eating dinner and drinking cider and wine on board. They later updated followers on Twitter about the fun they had during a quiz on the Monday night. Every evening, after returning to their berths in Cowes, the civil servants drank heavily on the boats and in pubs across town. Some could be seen in jackets bearing the name of their government department. Empty bottles of Bombay Sapphire gin, Desperados beer, Polish vodka, white and red wine and cans of Boddingtons beer could be seen discarded on the boats as they partied until the early hours. They ate an array of exotic cheeses, as well as crisps and dips and made Thai curries on board, while calling out to passers-by: ‘Come! Have a drink!’ On Wednesday evening, the yacht crews attended a ‘Pairs Pontoon Party,’ which involved eating curry and drinking Pimm’s until midnight. One member of the MoD team said three of her colleagues had been granted special leave to be there. Shooting the breeze: The party keeps rolling on despite the fact thousands of families across the UK are seeing their holiday plans thrown into jeopardy due to the severe backlog at the Passport Office . The provision, usually reserved for paternity leave or family bereavements, allows staff to be paid full salary while away, at taxpayers’ expense. ‘I can’t wait to come again next year,’ she said. ‘The weather’s been amazing. There has been a lot of drink.’ Tom Powell, who was on the trip, tweeted a picture of one of the yachts sailing in the sun, captioned with the hashtag ‘#harddayattheoffice’. On Thursday evening, the teams attended a ‘regatta dinner’ party at the 18th century Royal Corinthian Yacht Club building, known for hosting parties attended by the monarchy. They arrived in uniforms bearing the names of their departments, while a female Met Office employee could be seen downing a bottle of beer as she walked to the venue. Home Office officials raced as part of a UK Border Force team as thousands of families faced long waits for their passports amid mounting chaos at UK passport offices. The MoD is in the process of cutting billions of pounds from its budget, scrapping jets and warships. On Thursday, it announced 1,060 armed forces redundancies in its latest round of cuts. Meanwhile, HMRC staff attended the regatta only four months after employees of the same department went on strike over their employment rights. The trip also follows thousands of civil service job losses since 2010. What crisis? Staff arrive for a regatta dinner at a yacht club on the Isle of Wight during the 'bonding' regatta . Last night, the MoD admitted staff were allowed to take up to two days special paid leave for the trip, on top of their annual holiday entitlement. Official Civil Service HR guidance states: ‘Typical reasons for special leave include situations such as the death of a close relative.’ The Met Office also confirmed its staff would have been allowed paid time off. Other departments refused to comment, despite crews boasting about the paid time off during the week while out drinking in pubs. Civil servants could take part in the trip only if they were part of the Civil Service Sports Council, a not-for-profit organisation which this year received £600,000 from the taxpayer. The Cabinet office last night said staff were ‘expected’ to take leave for the regatta, although it was up to individual departments to decide if paid special leave was granted. It said the event raised money for charity and insisted the funding it gives to the CSSC was not specifically used for the sailing trip. The Home Office said its staff were not among those given special leave.","128 employees from range of government departments enjoyed yacht trip .

"By . Alan Roden . and Julie Anne Barnes . Alex Salmond is under pressure to sack one of his top aides after he was accused of 'smearing' the mother of a disabled child who spoke out against breaking-up the UK. Campbell Gunn, the First Minister's senior special adviser and political spokesman, has apologised 'unreservedly' to Clare Lally, who spoke at a Better Together rally this week. But a tearful Miss Lally yesterday refused to accept the apology and said it was an 'insult'. Opposition  accuse the SNP Scottish Government of being involved in a co-ordinated attack on Unionists. Clare Lally told hundreds of campaigners in Glasgow she was 'just an ordinary mum from Clydebank campaigning for Scotland to stay in the UK' At the rally, Miss Lally told hundreds of campaigners in Glasgow she was 'just an ordinary mum from Clydebank campaigning for Scotland to stay in the UK'. She told how she was grateful for the care health workers had given her seven-year-old twin girls, one of whom has cerebral palsy, and said she wanted to 'make sure our NHS remains the best in the world'. She was subsequently subjected to vile online abuse from so-called 'cybernats' who labelled her a 'liar' and a 'quisling' and accused her of exploiting her own disabled child for political purposes. One blogger suggested that Better Together was 'misleading people by presenting hardcore political activists as normal everyday folk' because Miss Lally failed to mention that she had been appointed to Labour's shadow cabinet as a carers' champion. The Wings Over Scotland website also questioned if she was 'Claire Lally', the daughter-in-law of former Labour Lord Provost of Glasgow Pat Lally. However, Miss Lally is not related to Mr Lally, and the blogger behind the site, Stuart Campbell, later edited the entry. Campbell Gunn, the First Minister's senior special adviser and political spokesman, has apologised 'unreservedly' to Miss Lally . But his original post, published around 10am yesterday, was followed by an email from Mr Gunn to the Daily Telegraph's Scottish political editor Simon Johnson at 10.53am. The correspondence, sent from Mr Gunn's Scottish Government address, stated: 'You are no doubt aware that the ""mother-of-two"" who described herself as ""just a normal person"" in the Telegraph today is actually a member of Labour's Shadow Cabinet and daughter-in-law of former Labour Lord Provost of Glasgow Pat Lally...' Last night Mr Gunn, a former political editor with the Sunday Post newspaper, said any suggestion of a co-ordinated attack was 'completely untrue'. But Miss Lally said: 'In the past 48 hours it's just been absolute hell, and that's because of him. 'I think I am only receiving the apology from him because he has been caught out. The email and inaccurate information has been shown for what it is. It is an attack on myself as a mum, as a person and as a parent. I won't be accepting this apology.' Miss Lally has campaigned for carers and children with disabilities since one of her twin girls, Katie, was born with cerebral palsy. Now seven, she has a number chronic and complex health conditions which means she requires 24-hour care. Miss Lally lives in Clydebank with her fiancé Derek Steel and Katie's twin, Holly. Yesterday Miss Lally, who was forced to give up her full-time job as a secretary, told the Scottish Daily Mail that she did not want to become a 'pawn' in the political debate. Speaking from her home, she said: 'I have been accused of using politics, but they have used my children. 'My battle is not the independence referendum. My battle is trying to get through this. I just want to make my children proud of me.' Both Labour and the Tories accused Mr Gunn of a 'smear'. Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont said: 'Apologies are not enough. Alex Salmond must sack his senior adviser Campbell Gunn. 'Campbell Gunn's attack on Clare Lally unleashed a tidal wave of vile abuse aimed squarely at her on the internet which caused Clare and her family immense distress. 'Once Campbell Gunn is sacked, we can then ask the many further questions this disgusting incident throws up. Did Alex Salmond sanction this attack? 'How far reaching is the First Minister's grip on the Nationalist machine which abuses and traduces his opponents?' First Minister Alex Salmond said Mr Gunn made a 'mistake' but is under pressure over attacks on opponents to independence . Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said: 'For such slurs and misinformation to be spread by one of the First Minister's taxpayer-funded key advisers is a new low for the SNP government in this referendum debate.' But Mr Gunn sought to defend his actions, saying: 'Nothing in the email I sent was intended in any way to be a personal slight on Miss Lally or question her absolute right to express her views. 'I apologise unreservedly for the upset and offence that has been caused to her and her family. 'I deplore online abuse directed against Miss Lally or anyone else - from whichever side in the referendum debate - and the assertion by the No camp aign that I had any involvement in the co-ordination of such activity is completely untrue.' Mr Salmond said: 'Campbell made a mistake and he has been told to apologise.'","Alex Salmond facing calls to sack Campbell Gunn for 'smearing' Clare Lally .

"By . Oliver Todd . and Charlie Scott . England's players were expected to be caught out by the heat in Manaus but instead their main trouble came from a more typical sportsman's woe - cramp. Raheem Sterling, Daniel Sturridge and Gary Cahill were all troubled during England’s 2-1 defeat to Italy in Manaus. The 27C heat and the 74 per cent humidity in Brazil could well have played a factor in their discomfort, as all three needed the help of their teammates, physios - and at one point even their opponents – to stretch out their weary legs.

Sterling, Sturridge and Cahill were appearing in their 45th, 42nd and 58th appearances of 2013-14 respectively. Liverpool youngster Sterling, who was employed in a No 10 role by Roy Hodgson tonight, went down clutching his hamstring on the hour mark, after sprinting to retrieve a pass. Glen Johnson and Italy players Giorgio Chiellini and Claudio Marchisio were on hand to help ease the 19-year-old’s cramp, and he was soon back on his feet. Struggle: Sturridge was another player who found himself struck down with cramp in Manaus . Ally or enemy: Claudio Marchisio had to lend Sterling a hand after he went down close to Italy's penalty area . Sterling had started the game brightly for England, with many thinking he had put Hodgson’s side ahead with a rising drive in the fourth minute that flew into the side netting of Salvatore Sirigu’s goal. He continued to torment Italy for much of the first half, before his performance dipped after the break, particularly in the final half an hour after he went down with cramp.

Despite having the best of the conditions, Rose was four over par after nine holes on Thursday, but birdied three of the next five before a duffed chip on the eighth cost him a fifth bogey of the day. 'I've got to play some great golf the rest of the week,' Rose said after finishing on a two-over-par 72. Looking for inspiration: Justin Rose reacts after missing a putt during his first round .

'I was telling myself if I get it back to two over and then shoot one under each for the next two days... that's the way I try to break it down. I shot two under on the back nine today and got myself back to two over, and even par is within striking distance. If I play well I feel I can get it under par.' The 33-year-old, looking to become the first player since Curtis Strange in 1989 to make a successful title defence, added: 'Being a different golf course I never really treated it as being defending champion. 'It was always going to be a new test so I just try to focus on the golf course. I feel like I'm playing pretty free out there.

"By . Ian Ransom, Reuters . Australia prevailed 6-0 over France in a dour, try-less contest on Saturday to seal the three-test series 2-0 and leave a subdued Melbourne crowd cold. In a low-quality clash littered with handling errors, second half penalties to fly-half Bernard Foley and scrumhalf Nic White were enough for the Wallabies to seal a scrappy win despite perfect conditions under the closed roof of Docklands Stadium. Having allowed the Wallabies to do what they pleased in the 50-23 opener in Brisbane, a more resolute Les Bleus, complete with 10 changes to the starting lineup, had the better of a scoreless first half, though rarely posed any attacking threat until a last-gasp raid in the final minutes. Close: Australia's Nick Cummin's (left) tries to evade a tackle during their narrow 6-0 win over France . Clash: Israel Folau (centre) is tackled during the win gave Australia an unassailable 2-0 lead in the series . Playing in Melbourne, heartland of Australian Rules football, the Wallabies appeared determined to kick away possession, but derived little advantage from the tactic, and blew several promising drives with poor execution. France executed the first promising move, however, a kick forward in the third minute sparking a foot-race between Foley and fullback Brice Dulin to the line, but the Wallabies fly-half prevailed by inches to cut off the chance. The Wallabies were controversially denied what would have been the matchâ€™s opening try to number eight Ben McCalman on video review in the 22nd minute, prompting howls of derision from the stands.A smart chipped kick from inside the French 22-yard line by inside centre Matt Toomua allowed McCalman to touch down but in the wild scramble toward the line Toomua was deemed to have tackled an opponent without the ball, though the contact was minimal and superfluous to the play. After Dulin missed a long-range penalty in the opening quarter, scrumhalf Morgan Parra botched a second three minutes before the break, leaving both teams scoreless to halftime and a crowd of 27,000 frustrated. Wrecking ball: France's outside centre Mathieu Bastareaud tries to break through Matt Toomua's tackle . Tight: The match was a nervy affair with neither side wanting to make a mistake and it lacked rhythm . Wallabies scrumhalf White repaid the favour twice in two minutes straight after the re-start, spraying the first kick wide and striking the post with the second, and though the rebound opened up a scoring chance out wide, the home side left it begging with a pass that sailed too high. Foley finally ticked the scoreboard over in the 53rd minute with a penalty kick from straight in front, drawing ironic cheers from the crowd. France was perhaps the more profligate, however, their few forays into the Wallabiesâ€™ half cut short by an errant pass or handling error. Trip: France's tour to Australia will see them lose the series even if they clinch the final match . An off-side penalty against replacement flanker Antoine Burban gave White a penalty he could not miss in the 65th minute but the scrum-half sprayed a simple chance to make it 9-0 with nine minutes left. France pushed in vain for a try in the final minutes, briefly rousing the unenthused crowd but the Wallabies cut off the threat to win their sixth successive match before next weekâ€™s final test in Sydney.","The Wallabies seal the three-match series with a Test to spare .

"By . Neil Ashton . Follow @@neilashton_ . A couple of weeks before the end of the season, Southampton’s new executive director Les Reed felt compelled to clear up a few outstanding issues. It was a spot of housekeeping, a reminder that everything was neat and tidy and in good working order as Southampton prepared to finish the season in eighth place. According to Reed, in a briefing with the media that was widely broadcast on April 27, there was nothing to see and nobody would be leaving Southampton. Move along, please. Dream move: Rickie Lambert joined boyhood club Liverpool for £4million after five seasons on the south coast . Is that the way to White Hart Lane? Mauricio Pochettino was quick to depart St Mary's after leading Southampton to eighth in the Premier League . Reed had been monitoring the news and was so irritated by the consistent reports linking manager Mauricio Pochettino and many of his players with moves elsewhere he felt a declaration was in order. Pochettino, he claimed, spoke with Reed for an hour a day, sometimes more, at Southampton’s training complex to discuss transfer targets and the club’s pre-season programme. All was well, he said. Contract negotiations with the Argentinian manager would progress smoothly, they just had to get the final two games of the season out of the way first and then it would all play out. Reed’s second point was about the players. There had been no bids and reports that they were negotiating ‘stellar transfer fees’ and salaries were well wide of the mark. Well, well, wide of the mark. He hammered home this point several times. The problem with a well-intentioned and earnest speech like this is when the protagonists have very differing opinions on how it will all play out at the end of the season. Pochettino was not about to walk out with two games left, against Swansea and Manchester United, of the season. That, in his mind, would come later. The problem with Reed’s endless cups of coffee in the manager’s office after training is that you can’t always see the bigger picture. Take Pochettino’s surprise visit to the Parc des Princes for the Champions League quarter-final first leg between Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea, as an example. On the move? Saints skipper Adam Lallana has also been widely linked with a move with Liverpool and Tottenham favourites to secure his services . Pochettino would be hard pushed to pass off a trip to Paris to watch two of Europe's superpowers as a scouting mission. He was there in case it all went wonky for PSG coach Laurent Blanc, putting himself in European football’s shop window at a time when he knew he was likely to leave Southampton. As soon as the season was over - and Tottenham had sacked Tim Sherwood - chairman Daniel Levy began negotiating his release from St Mary’s. Pochettino’s departure is no reason to panic, but the uncertainty surrounding the players is of far greater concern to Southampton’s supporters. Lynchpin: The excellent Dejan Lovren has excelled in his first season in the PRemier League . Of course there were no bids for Southampton’s players at the time of Reed’s housekeeping address because Liverpool, for example, were distracted by the title race. In any event, no matter how much interest Brendan Rodgers had in Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana and the outstanding Dejan Lovren, the transfer window was not even open. More on them in a moment. In between Pochettino’s departure to White Hart Lane and the completion of Lambert’s £4m move to Liverpool, two of Southampton’s outstanding academy coaches have been fired by Reed. This is all part of a fairly petty power battle between Reed, the Under 21 development coach with Jason Dodd and Paul Williams. The departed: Nicola Cortese (left) left St Mary's in January, while Les Reed promised there would be no-one leaving at the end of the season . To give you an idea of the esteem the pair are held in by the young academy graduates, Luke Shaw pointedly went off message while he was away with England to tweet that it was a bad decision. There has been friction in this area of the club for some time, mainly because the Under 18s served up by Dodd and Williams would bypass Martin Hunter’s Under 21 side to be involved with the senior side. That is a reflection of the quality that Shaw, James Ward-Prowse, Calum Chambers, Harry Reed and Sam Gallagher possess. It is a great pity because Southampton’s academy system and the commitment to youth is the envy of not only Premier League football, but Europe too. The sale of Lambert makes sense, particularly when a club is willing to absorb his wages, in excess of £50,000 a week, at the age of 32. Homegrown talent? Luke Shaw is another one from Southampton academy's famed production line who looks set to leave . For Reed, the wider issue is whether he can really convince his captain Lallana, plus Shaw and Lovren to stay at St Mary’s. There was a time under former executive chairman Nicola Cortese when this club had ambitions to finish fourth and qualify for the Champions League. That feels like a long way off now. Lallana is convinced he played his last game for the club on the final day of the season and Shaw is agitating for a move to Manchester United. If they all leave, then Reed’s words will have a hollow ring to them.","Southampton’s new executive director Les Reed announced there was nothing to see and nobody would be leaving Southampton in April .
Fast-forward less than two months and the club's manager Mauricio Pochettino and top-scorer Rickie Lambert have departed .

Unfamiliar: Jerome Boateng could be forced to play full back against Cristiano Ronaldo . Jerome Boateng and Benedikt Howedes are expected to play at full back, with Mats Hummels and Per Mertersacker partnering each other in the centre of defence. Captain and right back Philipp Lahm is likely to start in midfield - a position for which he has excelled at club side Bayern Munich - although Low did not rule out the possibility of pushing Lahm back to full back and playing Boateng alongside Mertesacker in central defence. Although Boateng has played full back before, he is more competent at centre back, as is Howedes who plays there for Schalke, and they would come up against Ballon D'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo on the flank. At least one of the two is likely to deputise at full back after Marcel Schmelzer was ruled out of the World Cup with a knee injury. His Borussia Dortmund team-mate Erik Durm replaced him in the squad but he is in the process of being re-trained as a defender, having started out as a striker, and so is unlikely to be risked.

"By . Nik Simon . Follow @@Nik_Simon88 . The smell of braai tinged the streets surrounding Kings Park last night and South Africa tasted blood as they demolished Wales 38-16 in the opening Test in Durban on Saturday. Wales were served up on a plate and their dismal record against Southern Hemisphere sides continued with a woeful performance on the Eastern Cape . Since Warren Gatland took over as head coach in 2007, Wales have beaten the big three – Australia, New Zealand and South Africa – just once. The misery continued in Durban and South Africa remains a country where Welsh rugby goes to rack and ruin. Too strong: South Africa's Cornal Hendricks shrugs off George North to go over for South Africa . Falling short: Tendai Mtawarirai is denied a try at the last minute after a great tackle from James Hook . Running riot: South Africa's Fourie du Preez holds off a tackle from Wales' Jon Davies . There were at least three minutes of Welsh optimism, but that was all. Dan Biggar put Wales ahead with an early drop-goal and it all went downhill from there. South Africa quickly worked out the Welsh frailties and they began to remind the tourists why they have never won a Test match in the Rainbow Nation. The rush defence was unlocked and Willie le Roux, the gifted Springbok, offered a master-class from full-back. Seven minutes into the game he chipped over the pressing defensive line and Bryan Habana showed his poaching instincts to get in behind Cuthbert and touch down for the opening try of the game. South Africa’s midfield had been identified as an area of weakness before the match. The experience gap between the two centre partnerships was stark. Jamie Roberts and Jonathan Davies, of Wales, had 98 Test starts at 12 and 13 while Jan Serfontein and JP Pietersen, their opponents, had zero. Too little too late: Alex Cuthbert (centre) scored a brilliant late consolation try for Wales . Mercurial: Willie le Roux (centre) scored a try and played a part in three of South Africa's other tries . But Roberts was shown a yellow card when he took out Le Roux in mid-air and the hosts took full advantage in the 10 minutes that followed. Three minutes into Roberts’ cool down period and the Kings Park crowd were back on their feet. The Springbok pack were inspired by the return of Victor Matfield, 37, who came out of retirement to become the oldest ever South African captain. The warhorse was reunited in the second row with partner-in-crime Bakkies Botha for the first time since 2011 and they rolled back the years as the Springbok pack rumbled forwards from a line-out to set up No 8 Duane Vermeulen to crash over. Another drop goal from Biggar offered some light relief but, with still just 21 minutes on the clock, the Springboks scored their third try when Le Roux goose-stepped between Cuthbert and Aaron Shingler to feed Habana for his second.. On target: Dan Biggar kicks a drop goal past team-mate Luke Charteris as South Africa's Bismarck du Plessis attempts to charge down . Damage was done but, with Roberts back on the field, Gatland would have hoped to see more cohesion across the park. But Wales were woeful. They failed to capitalise on their rare opportunities and Le Roux once again exposed the cracks when he gathered his own kick and wriggled through the tackle of George North to score. Biggar added a penalty just before the break but - with Wales trailing 28-9 at half time  - the sun set on the Eastern Cape and the match turned even darker for Gatland’s side. Morne Steyn added to his first-half points with an early second-half penalty and Le Roux got on the outside shoulder of Ken Owens to set up Hendricks for another Springbok try. There was a late breakaway try from Cuthbert but it was too late, Wales had already been cooked.","Duane Vermulen, Willie le Roux and Cornal Hendrick also go over as South Africa run riot in first Test in Durban .

Two men who have devoted the past six years of their lives to rescuing koalas have reportedly been banned from Terri Irwin's Australia Zoo after asking her not to lean on their car. Twin brothers Ray and Murray Chambers were regular volunteers at the wildlife park in Queensland and helped save 500 koalas last year. Their fight with Terri, the widow of Crocodile Hunter Steve Irwin, happened after Murray mentioned she was leaning on his car as she wrote something down, The Sunday Mail reports. Scroll down for video . Fight: Terri Irwin reportedly fell out with two volunteers at Australia Zoo after they mentioned she was leaning on their car . Murray, who is the co-founder of Sunshine Coast Koala Rescue, had just signed in a koala to be cared for by Australia Zoo Hospital when the argument kicked off. The brothers are now not allowed to escort harmed koalas into the hospital, after they previously helped out at the rescue centre one or two days a week. 'We're trying to negotiate to see if we can get back in there. It's a pretty sad event,' Ray told MailOnline on Sunday. He said they were banned 'four or five weeks ago'. 'It's going to impact us taking them in there and getting them into triage,' he added. Ray and Murray also issued a statement via their charity Sunshine Coast Koala Wildlife Rescue that confirmed they are not allowed to enter the driveway of the hospital and have had their volunteering duties axed. Banned: Twin brothers Ray and Murray Chambers were regular volunteers at the wildlife park in Queensland and saved 500 koalas last year . Terri and Steve Irwin took over the 100-acre zoo, which is located on the Sunshine Coast, in 1992 after its previous owners Bob and Lyn - Steve's parents - retired. In 2004, the couple opened the Australian Zoo Wildlife Hospital next to the zoo to help with animal care and rehabilitation. Since Steve was killed on 4 September 2006, when he was pierced in the chest by a stingray barb while filming a documentary, Terri has continued to run the zoo. In 2012, koalas were listed by the Australian Government as vulnerable in Queensland. Terri and Steve Irwin took over the 100-acre zoo, which is located on the Sunshine Coast, in 1992 from Steve's parents . Ray and Murray first got involved with koala rescue and the zoo six years ago as a charitable sideline to their mechanics business, WB Motors in Caloundra. It now plays a huge part in their lives. In February, Ray spoke out about how the struggling koala population could be extinct within five years. He explained that more than a dozen koalas had been killed on the Coast in the past six months. 'In peak times, we get called out to one koala rescue a day, sometimes two,' he told The Reporter. He also warned that as well as the usual threats - including sickness, loss of habitat and being hit by cars - koalas now have to look out for feral dogs and cows. 'Wild dogs are playing a big part now... They're a menace, taking everything - possums, birds, koalas, they're probably taking people's pets in their own yard,' he said. Koalas are already extinct in some parts of Queensland. 'At the end of the day we're losing the fight,' Ray warned.

"A young teenage boy, who was rushed to hospital in a serious condition after collapsing from a head knock during a rugby league game on Saturday, is now in a stable condition. The 13-year-old, playing for the Macarthur Saints, collided heads with an opposing player and left the field for treatment, but was later allowed to resume play in the match with Campbelltown, south west of Sydney.

"By . Associated Press . In their plans to shoot up a high school, two Tennessee teenagers studied the 1999 Columbine massacre, hoping to maximize the number of student and faculty deaths, according to officials who say they seized weapons and journals detailing attack plans. The boys wanted to correct what they saw as mistakes made in the Colorado shooting, Hawkins County Sheriff Ronnie Lawson said, according to the  Kingsport Times-News. Authorities became aware of the plans for Volunteer High School in Church Hill last October after they were alerted by a counselor for one of the boys, who are 16 and 17 years old. Scroll down for video . Two teens, who are not named as they are juveniles, had long been planning to commit mass murder at Volunteer High School, pictured, in Church Hill Tennessee. Authorities have charged them both after confiscated detailed journals and school floor plans and weapons . The boys were charged Thursday with conspiracy to commit first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit an act of terrorism and possession of explosive components. Both teenagers have been in custody on other charges since the investigation began. Arrest warrants on the new charges were issued several months ago but were served as the boys were about to be released. Deputies searched the home of the younger boy, characterized as the leader, last December and said they seized guns owned by the boy's father as well as journals detailing plans for an attack, floor plans of the high school, fire crackers and gun powder. Lawson said investigators also found videos the boys posted on the Internet of themselves holding AR-15 rifles and detonating Molotov cocktails. He said the younger boy was obsessed with mass murders, serial killers and the Columbine shooting. The boys had been waiting to execute their plan for their senior year. At a hearing in juvenile court Thursday, one of the boys was given a $75,000 bond with restrictions of house arrest, full-time adult supervision and restraint from all Hawkins County school property, Lawson said. The second boy will have a bond hearing at a later date. Third Judicial District Attorney General Berkeley Bell said prosecutors still are deciding whether to ask that the boys be tried as adults. Lawson said he could not release the names of the boys or give out any more specific information because the suspects are juveniles and because the investigation is ongoing.","Boys, 16 and 17, are in custody in Tennessee after plotting an attack at Volunteer High School .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Linguists claim that humans learned to speak by copying primates and birds 100,000 years ago. A silvery gibbon is pictured . There are plenty of animals that talk by mimicking the language of humans. But now linguists claim that humans learned to speak by copying primates and birds 100,000 years ago. While previous research has suggested that humans copied the melodic part of our language from birds, U.S. experts now think that we evolved the content-carrying part of our speech from primates. The two types of communication fused together into roughly the form of human language that we know today, the experts said. Shigeru Miyagawa, a linguist from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, (MIT) said: ‘How did human language arise? It's far enough in the past that we can't just go back and figure it out directly. The best we can do is come up with a theory that is broadly compatible with what we know about human language and other similar systems in nature.’ Scientists believe that human language is unique as it can expand to describe an infinite amount of new meanings. But our language still shares qualities with other animals. ‘Yes, human language is unique, but if you take it apart in the right way, the two parts we identify are in fact of a finite state,’ Dr Miyagawa said. ‘Those two components have antecedents in the animal world. According to our hypothesis, they came together uniquely in human language.’ The team’s reasoning goes that as birds only sing a certain number of melodies, humans much have incorporated another aspect from nature – probably from primates. Dr Miyagawa explained that the human language consists of two distinct layers: the expressive layer, which relates to the structure of sentences, and the ‘lexical layer’ where the meaning is found. While previous research has suggested that humans got the melodic part of our language from birds, U.S. experts now think that we evolved the content-carrying part of our speech from primates. A screen print showing a family of prehistoric cave dwellers is pictured . A 2013 study claims that Neanderthals could speak like modern humans. In the last 20 years, some scientists have come to believe that Neanderthals had the ability to communicate with each other using speech, and new analysis of a fossilised hyoid bone has added weight to their claims. The horseshoe-shaped bone in the neck looks like a modern human’s and now computer modelling has revealed that it was probably used in a similar way. The hyoid bone supports the root of the tongue and enables humans to speak. Researchers believe the way the bone worked is ‘highly suggestive’ of complex speech in Neanderthals. Before the discovery of a Neanderthal hyoid bone in 1989, it was thought that only modern humans were capable of complex speech, which evolved around 100,000 years ago. He thinks that both layers are derived from the languages of birds and mammals. The researchers, who were joined by colleagues from the University of Tokyo, admit that there is more work to be done on their hypothesis. The most recent ancestor between birds and humans appears to have existed about 300 million years ago, so there would almost have to be an indirect connection via older primates - even possibly the silvery gibbon, which is unusual because it sings. The endangered animals can make long, complicated songs using 14 types of note to signal territory, woo mates and communicate with family members. Robert Berwick, co-author of the study, published in the journal Psychology, noted that researchers are still exploring how these two modes could have merged in humans, but the general concept of new functions developing from existing building blocks is a familiar one in evolution. ‘You have these two pieces. You put them together and something novel emerges,’ he said. ‘We can't go back with a time machine and see what happened, but we think that's the basic story we're seeing with language.’","Linguists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology claim that early humans evolved the content-carrying part of our speech from primates .

"By . Jennifer Newton . Larissa Westcott from Windsor, who says her dreams of being cabin crew with British Airways have been dashed because she has a tattoo on her foot . A student claims she was dismissed from an interview for her dream job as cabin crew with British Airways because she has a small tattoo on her foot. Larissa Westcott says she was just 20 minutes into the all-day interview at British Airways' headquarters at Heathrow airport when she was told her application wouldn't be taken any further because of the inking on her left foot. Miss Westcott, of Windsor in Berkshire had always dreamed of a life working at 36,000 feet for the airline. But once she told interviewers that she had a discreet tattoo of the word 'Aquarius', which is her star sign, her hopes were dashed. The 20-year-old said: 'I had put on a smart dress, pinned my hair up in a bun, put on heels and applied some red lipstick. I looked the part. 'It was all going well until the woman said, ""do you have any tattoos?"" I said yes and the woman looked mortified. Straightaway, she dropped her pen and said it was over. 'I wasn't even given a chance. I was humiliated and had to shuffle past all the other candidates on my way out. It was so embarrassing.' British Airways is currently the subject of a BBC documentary called 'A Very British Airline', which has shown the strict standards the company has when employing cabin crew. But Miss Westcott, who is a college student while working as an admin clerk, thinks British Airways need to 'get with the times'. She added: 'If you go to any High Street and picked 10 people at random, I bet eight of them will have a tattoo. The tattoo, which spells out her star sign Aquarius on her foot, which she believes would have been covered by the tights cabin crew wear as uniform . The 20-year-old, who is a college student and also works as an admin clerk says British Airways 'needs to get with the times' 'Mine is so small and discreet - plus you wouldn't even see it underneath the black tights you have to wear as part of the BA uniform. 'I was really upset because I love BA and I would still fly with them even now. For me, it is the best airline out there - but the way they treated me was ridiculous. 'I feel I would have been an asset for them. I feel BA are losing out on employing good people because their rules are too strict. A spokesman for British Airways says their uniform policy is clearly stated in the application process . 'If passengers can't see the tattoos, then what is the problem?' However a spokesman for British Airways said: 'We receive thousands of applications to become British Airways cabin crew every year and are proud of the high standards of customer service the successful applicants deliver.

"By . Laura Williamson . Follow @@laura_mail . Imagine turning up for a five-day survival course in the Scottish Highlands and finding a man known as ‘Psycho’ staring back at you. Stuart Pearce can just about see the funny side of his outward bound experience last October, just one part of a diverse football sabbatical that has taken the former England Under 21 manager from Cape Verde to the Canadian Rockies. He will return to the game full-time on July 1, as the manager of Nottingham Forest, and looks considerably refreshed and energised, even after a morning coaching children at a school near Upton Park in east London. Ready: Stuart Pearce cannot wait to take over as manager at Nottingham Forest . Direction: Pearce (left) managed England U21s and was a coach with the England senior side too . ‘We just pitched up for five days in the wilds of Scotland last October with two ex-Marines,’ says Pearce. ‘It was brilliant, absolutely brilliant. We learned survival skills, shelter-building, skinning hares. ‘To be fair the other people came from such diverse parts of the world that only two knew (of me). There was a fella from Dublin, one from Southampton, myself, an ex-Marine from Alaska, a policewoman from Melbourne and a Chinese fella from the tourism industry. ‘Within a day we were in a shelter we had built ourselves in a wood glade with a camp fire chopping up bits of rabbit to cook for dinner that night. It was great fun.’ Pearce had booked the course the previous January, knowing his six years as England Under 21 manager would come to an end after the European Championships that summer. But any suggestion his time in the wild taught him anything about himself is firmly, if politely, dismissed. There has been no great spiritual awakening over the past year for this straight-forward former left back, only an opportunity to indulge his love of traveling, theatre and live gigs. Selection: If Wayne Rooney is out of form and unfit then Pearce does not think he should be selected . Dropped: Pearce says he would not have played Rooney at the 2010 World Cup as he was out of form . ‘Did I learn anything about myself? Not really,’ he says. ‘You’re permanently hungry on a survival course and you prioritise keeping warm and eating. That’s it.’ It is the same no-nonsense approach that has characterised Pearce as a player, coach and manager. He has already told his Forest staff to forget the ‘sleeping giant’ tag that suggests the club has some God-given right to win promotion to the Premier League owing to its illustrious past. ‘I hate it,’ he says. The same approach underpins Pearce’s response to being asked if the debate about whether Wayne Rooney should start for England is justified. ‘I think he should be treated as I always have done with every player in my care,’ he says. ‘I went to the U21 tournament in 2011, had to convince Theo Walcott to go, convince Arsene Wenger to let me have Walcott and then his form wasn’t good enough so I left him out after the first game. Theo’s in tears about it, but I’ve got no duty to pick him when Adam Johnson’s playing so well. Youth: Pearce hopes that Roy Hodgson (right) plays the youngsters like Raheem Sterling (left) Progress: He thinks that players such as Luke Shaw will not learn from just being taken for the 'experience' ‘In 2010 Wayne should have been left out of the team because his form was so poor, but Capello kept him in the team. 'This is England. Even at club level, I’ve always had a mentality of no matter who you are, you can go in and out of the team. ‘Brian Clough was a great master for us. You knew straight away he would put you out of the team as an example to the rest of the group if your standards dropped.’ ‘Quarter-finals’ is Pearce’s blunt assessment of England’s chances in Brazil, while the suggestion Roy Hodgson’s squad might get cabin fever, or struggle to be away from home, is also given short shrift. ‘Every time I hear a player say “we didn’t have this or that” I’m embarrassed for my profession, if I’m being honest with you,’ says Pearce, capped 78 times by England. ‘It just shows a total lack of imagination and IQ, probably. ‘You’re there to do a job at, arguably, the greatest moment in your life. I was an international for 12 years and I played at one World Cup Finals (in 1990). That shows you everyone should grasp it with both hands.’ Raw: Players such as Ross Barkley (right) need game time at the World Cup or at youth level tournaments . Pearce’s passion for wearing the England shirt has never been questioned, but his gripe is that young, exciting and talented players such as Luke Shaw and Ross Barkley have been promoted to the senior side before their time. It might seem a perverse approach from a former Under 21 boss, but Pearce’s mantra has been consistent: English players should serve apprenticeships at Under 17, Under 19 and Under 21 level in order to make the senior side more successful. He would therefore have picked Ashley Cole - ‘the best left back England have ever had’ - ahead of Shaw. He calls his six years with the FA ‘brilliant’ but admits the ‘politics’ - those annual battles with Premier League managers in a bid to select the best players - were ‘a slight frustration’. That feels like Pearce is, for once, treading carefully, given the considered argument that follows. ‘If Luke Shaw comes back from this World Cup having not kicked a ball I would have said it was a wasted adventure for him,’ he says. ‘I think he would have been better going to the Toulon Tournament (with England’s Under 20 side) and playing in the Under 21 qualifier. That’s where we miss a trick time and time again. Psycho: Pearce was nicknamed 'psycho' or his tough-tackling and no-nonsense approach . Seasoned pro: Pearce was capped 78 times by his country and played at major tournaments . ‘I think we’ve got a lot of players in the England squad who I’m not sure will deliver - and that’s for good and for bad. I’ve just got my fingers crossed they play minutes. ‘Too many of our young players keep missing tournaments. It’s a sad thing. It’s not a duty of care to our best players who, in the thin pool that we have, have to play 90 minutes in every international get-together. ‘Their clubs give them a ready-made excuse to get out of the younger age groups, saying they’ve grown out of it; the agents don’t want their players playing and then there’s the egos of the players themselves. They don’t want it. ‘All we do is strip down bare our pool of talent, then leave them in the stand and not let them play football. We try to build the roof first and it won’t work.’ ‘Psycho’, after all, knows all about surviving in the wild these days.

"By . Charlie Scott . Andres Iniesta scored the goal that won Spain the 2010 World Cup but Iker Casillas was just as important in that victory over Holland, particularly the one-on-one save he made from Arjen Robben that the winger recently admitted still gives him nightmares. It’s safe to say Robben achieved at least a little redemption as Spain collapsed in Salvador, the fleet of foot Dutchman starring in a four-goal second-half blitz.

For so long Casillas has been the bedrock of the Spain national side. Now he looks like a weak link. The night could have gone so differently for a man once referred to as ‘San Iker’ back home in Madrid. After keeping four consecutive clean sheets in the knockout stages of Spain’s successful World Cup campaign in 2010, before kick-off against Holland Casillas was 85 minutes from breaking the all-time record for most consecutive minutes without conceding at World Cups. As it happened he got to within 41 minutes of passing Walter Zuniga’s 1990 milestone of 517 – before another Manchester United player, Robin van Persie, shattered his dream with an outrageous lobbed header right before the break to cancel out Xabi Alonso’s earlier penalty. Legend: Casillas was close to setting a record for longest time without conceding at a World Cup . Next generation: But now his future is in doubt with David de Gea waiting in the wings to replace him . There was nothing Casillas could do about that unique finish from Van Persie, but it was a completely different story in the second-half. Robben’s goal early in the second-half, Holland’s second of the evening, took a slight deflection off Spain centre-back Sergio Ramos but Casillas was well-positioned to stop the strike. He didn’t. The ball looped over his legs and Holland were ahead. Then in the 64th minute Casillas was at fault for the third Dutch goal, making a mess of a free-kick from the left by parrying the ball on to Stefan de Vrij who bundled home from a yard or so out. And Holland’s fourth was all Casillas’ making. Ramos slipped a straightforward backpass to him inside the Spain box but his first touch was woeful, allowing Van Persie to nick the ball away and prod it over the line. Ten minutes from the end it was time for Robben’s revenge. The sight of Casillas, on his 154th international appearance, scrambling to stop the former Chelsea attacker after he jinked past him will linger in the memory. Robben easily evaded Casillas, who lost his footing as he tried to change direction, before the flying Dutchman set himself and fired past the recovering Spain defence. The worrying thing for Spain is that this flapping, uncertain Casillas is not a new development. Dropped: Casillas lost his place at Real Madrid under Jose Mourinho . Continuation: Carlo Ancelotti only played Casillas in cup games . In favour: Diego Lopez was the man to replace Casillas between the sticks at the Bernabeu . But for Sergio Ramos’ game-saving header deep into injury time at the end of the Champions League final, Real Madrid would have lost to city rivals Atletico and Casillas would have been to blame. His decision to sprint from his line and try to gather Diego Godin’s looping header was a colossal error of judgement, as the ball bounced over him and over the line to give Atletico a surprise lead. De Gea, in contrast, was a rare ray of light in an otherwise bleak season for Manchester United. He made very few mistakes over the course of an ill-fated campaign, as many around him struggled for form. After rising through the ranks at Casillas’ club enemies Atletico and captaining the Spain Under-21 side De Gea made the switch to Old Trafford in 2011. And despite a rocky start to life in the Barclays Premier League he has since established himself as one of the best goalkeepers in the country, if not Europe. It has been a tough 18 months for Casillas. Dropped by former Real manager Jose Mourinho in favour of Diego Lopez, the 33-year-old has flittered in and out of the team since. He played in most of the cup fixtures under Carlo Ancelotti this season, but featured just twice in La Liga. With only nine international minutes under his belt – he made his debut in a World Cup warm-up friendly against El Salvador on June 8 – it would be a gamble to start De Gea, but in the wake of Casillas’ latest error-strewn display it could just be one that would pay off for Spain boss Vicente del Bosque.","Iker Casillas looked shaky as Spain lost 5-1 to Holland in World Cup .

When the English obsession with Andrea Pirlo turns to the ‘panenka’ penalty he scored against Joe Hart at Euro 2012, England’s keeper can’t remember a thing. Perhaps it is better that way. It was in Kiev, with England leading 2-1 in the shoot-out at the Donbass Arena, when Hart raised his arms and stuck his tongue out at the Italian as he took aim from 12 yards. Hart guessed to his right and the great Italian clipped his penalty down the centre of the goal. Soon enough, England were heading home. ‘I’ll never regret how it was, I saw it as the best way for us to win the shoot-out,’ said Hart. Cheeky: Andrea Pirlo executes a clever chipped 'panenka' penalty over Joe Hart at Euro 2012 . Life through a lens: Hart leads his team-mates as England arrive at their hotal in Manaus before re-facing Italy . ‘I don’t think there was personal vengeance from him and there certainly wasn’t any from me. He did what he thought he needed to do for his country and I did what I thought was best for mine. 'I couldn’t even tell you what I did. But it felt right at the time. It obviously wasn’t.’ Now a two-time Premier League winner with Manchester City, these are good times for Hart, 27, and he has come to appreciate the demands of playing at the highest level. ‘I want to do well for this team and this nation,’ he added. ‘A lot of time and effort has gone into it and the more you’re involved the more you realise that it is more than football. It means an awful lot to a lot of people. Through his paces: Hart trains at the Urca military base in preparation for the ultimate test against Italy . 'A lot of money has been invested and a lot of time and care, from me personally, has gone into this. I want to make it all worthwhile.’ At the last World Cup, in South Africa, Hart became increasingly irritated with the Italian coaching staff who appeared to be calling him ‘John’. Fabio Capello was the main culprit and Hart admitted: ‘I did take offence about that, but I’ve calmed down. Since then I’ve been called “John” by a lot of Italians who know me — I think it’s just how they talk. It was just a mispronunciation.’ Loggerheads: Hart (second left) admits frustration over his relationship with ex-boss Fabio Capello (left) A goalkeeper’s life is a fragile one and there have been times this season when City’s keeper has been under fire.

"By . Tom Latchem . Les Dennis is feeling blessed. A year ago, facing his 60th birthday and unhappy with work, his wife advised him to make a wish list of things he wanted to achieve and three have come true. Says Les, 'I wrote ""join a soap"" - I wanted to be in Corrie – and I am! I was also keen to move out of London and we're now in Cheshire. And the West End stage was on the list and I got a role in the musical Spamalot! It's absolutely amazing.' The Spamalot song Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life could be his theme tune and the former Family Fortunes host says he always tries to be cheery when things seem bleak. Les says that he is a really happy place having found his dream role and finding true love, he has completely overcome his past daemons . Like after his car-crash appearance on Celebrity Big Brother in 2002 during his split from wife Amanda Holden – he was sad and emotional on camera – which saw him branded 'Les Miserable'. 'Big Brother wasn't my finest hour,' says Les. 'I did it for a career boost but it didn't work out like that. But I believe if you stay positive and ask the Universe, things will come to you.' And they did, in the shape of Ricky Gervais, who gave Les a role – as an exaggerated version of the downtrodden character the public had seen on CBB – in his comedy series Extras. 'I encouraged Ricky to go as far as he wanted with the character because I didn't see myself as this sad loser. Extras changed the public's perception of me hugely. I'll always be grateful to him for giving me that chance,' he says. Les says that his most embarrassing was on his first day: 'The first thing I had to do on Corrie was run out of Gail's house chased by Kylie (far right). But instead of jumping into my own bashed-up van I got into  a shiny Mercedes belonging to one of the crew! We had to film it again, but as it was my first time on set, hopefully it can be forgiven!' Now Les can't believe he's in the show he watched from its start in 1960. Les, who'd become fed up with touring in theatre productions when he got the call to audition for the role of Corrie crook Michael Rodwell, says, 'I have to pinch myself – it's the ultimate job.' He adds that all his showbiz experience counted for nothing when he ventured onto the show's most iconic set. 'When I filmed my first scene in The Rovers Return I felt overawed. It was one of the most nerve-racking things I've done.' Last week, Les's character Michael came face-to-face with his burglary victim Gail as part of a restorative justice scheme – and they're set to strike up a relationship. Could he be Gail's fifth husband? 'Maybe I could be one that lasts – Gail could use some luck!' Les met his wife Claire, a life coach 18 years his junior, in 2005. They had daughter Eleanor in 2008 and son Thomas in 2011. In between, the pair married. It was 'third time lucky' for Les, who has a grown-up son, Philip, from his first marriage to Lynne Webster, and split from his second wife, Britain's Got Talent judge Amanda Holden, after she cheated on him with actor Neil Morrissey. Says Les, 'I'm an eternal optimist and a romantic, so I had the chance to get it right. I feel so settled and happy and blessed. I have a wonderful woman who looks out for me.' Cats or dogs? Both! We have two dogs -Lhasa Apso-poodle crosses called Buster and Dizzy -as well as a cat called Libby. Holidays, America or Europe?  I love the Dordogne in France -we rent a gîte there every year. Pizza or pasta? Pasta's my  favourite but I haven't had it for ages as I'm not eating wheat as part of a 5:2 diet. I miss it! Goodfellas or The Godfather?  The Godfather. I still get nervous  at the really tense bits. Audi or BMW? I have an Audi A5 - I like reliable cars, not fancy ones. Rugby or football? Football -I'm  a massive Liverpool fan. Outdoors or sofa? I walk and walk. It's when I can think about stuff.","Les Dennis has landed his dream role in Coronation Street .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . From children to high-flying businesses executives, fold-up scooters are a popular way to get around town quickly, but they're often bulky and awkward to carry. Now there’s a new design of scooter that's so tiny, it folds up to the size of an A4 piece of paper. A university student created the award-winning scooter by linking pieces of aluminium with a cable, which when tightened, pull them together to support an adult’s weight. The scooter was designed by London-based student George Mabey. It works by linking parts of aluminium with a cable which, when tightened, pull them together to support an adult's weight. At its smallest, the scooter (pictured) is approximately 8-inches wide and 11-inches tall - the same size as an A4 piece of paper . The scooter folds down to the size of an A4 piece of paper. It is so small it can fit in a rucksack or handbag. The lightweight scooter weighs less than 11lbs (5kg) and will be on display at an exhibition at London South Bank University from Saturday. There are no immediate plans to release the scooter. In fact, George Mabey’s design is so small it can fit inside a handbag, and could go on sale soon. The 22-year-old from Southampton recently won the top prize at the Power of Aluminium Awards, which celebrates innovative uses of the metal. His scooter weighs less than 11lbs (5kg) and has gone on show at London South Bank University as part of its Product Design and Engineering Product Design degree show. The lightweight scooter (pictured with its designer George Mabey) weighs less than 11lbs (5kg) and will be on display at an exhibition at London South Bank University from Saturday. There are no plans to release the scooter as yet . The product (pictured) recently won the top prize at the Power of Aluminium Awards, which celebrates innovative uses of the metal. Mabey picked up his award at a ceremony hosted by the Aluminium Federation, and held at the Houses of Parliament . The scooter (pictured) will be a lightweight alternative to the current foldable bikes used by commuters . Just like a conventional scooter, it . measures 37 inches (95cm) in height when fully extended, but folds up to . a tiny 11.7inches (29.7cm) in length and 8.3inches (21cm) in width when . collapsed – exactly the same size as a sheet of A4 paper. ‘The . innovative design will fetch a premium price on the market,’ said Alan . Arthur, marketing and communications executive at the Aluminium . Federation. ‘Nothing else out there at the moment folds away this small and it could even fit in a handbag. ‘Aluminium weighs a third of steel and now Jaguar and Land Rover cars are made from the metal. ‘Based on some of the premium fold-away bikes, like Brompton Bicycles, this product will sell for several times that of a standard scooter - so up to and over £1,000.’ George picked up his award and prize of £1,000 at the ceremony, which was hosted by the Aluminium Federation and held at the Houses of Parliament. Mabey said: ‘Having my work acknowledged at the awards and recognised by the industry is the icing on the cake. It’s a great way to finish my time at university.’ Simon MacVicker, president of the Aluminium Federation who hosted the awards, added: ‘This year’s awards have really demonstrated the immense talent among young people.

"By . Steph Cockroft . A historic folly which was bought for just £1 when it fell into a woeful state has now gone on the market for £750,000 - after the owners spent 13 years restoring it to its former glory. Philip Evans and Christopher Joll bought the 'jewel of a property' near Shrewsbury, Shropshire in 2001, complete with shattered ceilings, a crumbled tower and overgrown trees jutting through the broken windows. The pair bought the building for £350,000 from a local philanthropist, who acquired the dilapidated property for just £1 and tried to bring it up to scratch. Sham Castle, which sits proudly on top of a 60ft hill overlooking 1.7acres on land near Shrewsbury, . Shropshire, has been put on the market for £750,000 after being bought . for £1 just 30 years ago . The Georgian castle was sold to a bookshop owner in 1984 after falling . into such a state of disrepair that the ceilings had crumbled and trees . were growing through the broken windows. But it was snapped up by the current owners in 2001, who set to work renovating the property . The stunning three-turreted castle, formerly known as both Black Dick's Castle and Keeper's Tower, was bought by Philip Evans and Christopher Joll who have spent more than one decade restoring the historic building to its former glory . But after spending more than decade . working on the run-down wreck, Sham Castle has again blossomed into the . enchanting Georgian castle it once was - and is now being sold for . double the amount for which it was last bought. Mr Evans, 53, said: 'It’s been hard work but a lot of fun and I think we have triumphed. We will very sad to sell this jewel of a property.' The stunning three-turreted hexagonal castle - formerly known as both Black Dick’s Castle and Keeper’s Tower - was originally built by aristocrat Sir Edward Smythe in 1780, on the grounds of his sprawling country mansion, Acton Burnell Hall. The lavish . building was home to an ornate music chamber, which Sir Edward and his . family used for exuberant summer parties and concerts, and later became a gamekeeper's cottage. But by the 1950s, the property had fallen into disrepair and was left empty. In 1984, . after decades of neglect, the dilapidated castle was in such a poor state that it was sold . to local bookshop owner and philanthropist Christopher Powney for just . £1. He renovated the property to a livable standard - but there was still a lot of work to be done to bring it out of its woeful state. The Grade II listed property has been renovated in an 18th Century style . to fit with the castle's heritage. The property includes an opulent . drawing room, formerly known as the music room. The renovation involved repairing the fireplace, having the plasterwork restored and redoing the walls, which was intricately carried out by Mr Evans . The former music room is the centre of the property and features heavily . in the castle's history. When the property was bought, it still . featured intricate plasterwork depicting musical instruments all over . the ceiling . A photo of the music room, believed to be taken in the early 1950s, which . shows the dilapidated music room, which has since been turned into a . scene of opulence . But the fate of the Grade II-listed folly was changed in 2001 when it was snapped up by Mr Joll, who . writes and directs the British Military Tournament, and Mr Evans, an art . gallery owner. The pair, who are now moving to Bath, spent an undisclosed amount of money returning the property to its previous condition. As well as redecorating every room inside the three-bedroom property, the pair also had to repaint the outside of the castle and landscape the castle's grounds. Mr Evans, 53, said: 'When Christopher . Powney rescued the folly in 1984 it was in an awful state - the ceilings . had fallen down, one of the towers had crumbled and all the windows . were broken and there were trees growing through them. The folly's hexagonal kitchen and dining room, which is described as 'small . but perfectly form', has been decorated in an !8th Century-style and features wooden . beams . This spiral staircase was also put into the renovated home after the new . owners got to work restoring it. The staircase . leads to the drawing room and another bedroom . One of the bedrooms in the folly - a name coined in the 16th Century, . but now more associated with the 18th Century due to their eccentricity . and rustic charm - continues the historic theme . 'The garden was completely overgrown with nettles. Mr Powney made it habitable but didn’t live there for very long. 'We . bought the folly in 2001 and set about restoring in an 18th Century . style. I meticulously picked out the detail in the plaster and made the . garden my project.' For the men, the . restoration of the music room was one of the hardest tasks. The fireplace - which was pumping out smoke when the pair bought the castle - had to be replaced and all the plasterwork was restored. The re-work of the walls, which included painting the intricate adornments white, took nearly six months of long weekends, while the ceiling was painted in an extravagant style to fit the folly's reputation. Now the renovated property gleams from above a 60ft hill in the crater of an extinct volcano, among 1.7acres of wooden gardens. The home looks out to a garden which was previously full of 'overgrown nettles' but was landscaped by the new owners when it was bought in 2001 . The 1.7acre plot includes a garden pavilion, as well as wooded gardens and a 60ft hill in the crater of an extinct volcano . It revolves around a stunning hexagonal kitchen and dining room, which sits on the ground floor with two bedrooms and a regal-looking hallway. Up the spiral staircase is the drawing room and a third bedroom. The earliest use of the word 'folly' to . refer to a whimsical piece of architecture was in the 16th Century. But with their quirky combination . of eccentricity, romanticism and rustic . charm, follies are more commonly associated with the 18th Century. The dilapidated castle had to be completely repainted, inside and . outside, when it was bought by the latest owners. They said it had been . made habitable by the previous owner but that there was still a lot of . work to be done . Artist Philip Evans, one of the current owners, spent six months of weekends intricately painting the ceiling in the music room, adding to the 'unique' charm of the folly . Belinda Hutchinson-Smith, from estate agents Strutt and Parker, which is marketing the property, said: 'Sham Castle is utterly enchanting and unique - there’s nothing else quite like it. 'It has been through several lives over the years, going from a beautiful Georgian castle to a gamekeeper’s cottage. 'In 2001 the current vendor bought it and it has since been totally restored to its former glory. There is something wonderfully British about follies and Sham Castle is one of the best. 'It might be small but it is perfectly formed, and the views are absolutely magical. It is a very special place.' Acton Burnell Hall is now a private boarding school called Concord College.","Sham Castle, set over 1.7acres near Shrewsbury, Shropshire, was sold in 1984 for £1 after falling into disrepair .

"By . James Rush . and Associated Press . It is one of the world's most important and best preserved Crusader castles, which once held off a siege by the Muslim warrior Saladin some 900 years ago and was lauded for its beauty by Lawrence of Arabia. But the Crac des Chevaliers has now fallen victim to the chaos of Syria's civil war following a siege between Government forces and villagers and rebels using the castle for refuge, much like the Crusaders before them. The Government offensive in March saw heavy artillery damage the castle's walls, while an airstrike punctured its roof and shrapnel tore through its religious artifacts. Scroll down for video . Damage: The Crac des Chevaliers, the world's best preserved medieval Crusader castle, has fallen victim to the chaos of Syria's civil war after becoming part of a siege in March . Rubble: Heavy artillery damaged the castle's walls, an airstrike punctured its roof and shrapnel tore through its religious artifacts during the offensive . Towering: The Crac des Chevaliers is listed as a UNSECO World Heritage Site and once held off a siege by the Muslim warrior Saladin some 900 years ago . The damage done to the majestic stone structure, listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site, shows that the warring sides will stop at nothing, including the destruction of the country's rich heritage, to hold on to power or territory. About two years ago, President Bashir Assad's forces identified the Sunni-populated village of Hosn as backing the rebels. They began an armed blockade that allowed no one to leave or go inside. The government said Hosn harbored foreign, al-Qaida-linked armed insurgents who terrorized neighboring, mostly Christian villages. 'The terrorists killed and kidnapped people and even chopped off their heads,' said a Syrian army officer, speaking on the condition of anonymity, using the government term for the insurgents. 'We had to stop them at any cost.' His claim could not be independently verified and Syrian government officials accompanied Associated Press journalists on their trip in the region. Under the heavy bombardment last winter, Hosn's population of around 9,000 people had nowhere to go but up the hill to the castle. Some fled to neighboring Lebanon in a daring dash through the army blockade. Hundreds barricaded themselves inside the castle - men, women and children. Among them were dozens of rebel fighters who occasionally lobbed mortar shells from inside the tall walls, hitting nearby Christian villages, government soldiers and locals say. Refuge: Under heavy bombardment last winter, Hosn's population of around 9,000 people had nowhere to go but up the hill to the castle . Shelter: The villagers apparently hoped that castle's thick walls and its historic importance would prevent the Syrian army from further shelling . The insurgents are overwhelmingly from the country's Sunni majority. Shiite Muslims and Christian minorities have either remained neutral or supported Assad, fearing for their fate should hard-liners come to power. Those who found shelter inside the citadel ate the little food they had taken with them, or sneaked out at night to search for anything that could be cooked, including cats and dogs. For seven months, they slept in the tiny church inside a walled compound, or in huge and dark stone halls used as horse stables by the Crusaders in the 12th century. Mattresses and blankets, together with clothes, shoes and gas cookers lay scattered on damp stone and soil floors inside the castle when AP journalists recently visited it. Pages from a copy of the Quran fluttered in the breeze inside the church, which was turned into a mosque when Ottomans captured the fortress in the 13th century. The villagers apparently hoped that castle's thick walls and its historic importance would prevent the Syrian army from further shelling. It didn't. In March, during a massive government offensive against opposition strongholds on the border with Lebanon, Syrian jets unleashed a series of airstrikes. Heavy cannon fire pummeled the castle walls, with shells causing some ancient stone structures to crumble. Some of the shells ricocheted against the mighty stone structures, leaving deep marks on the historic citadel. Difficulties: Those who found shelter inside the citadel ate the little food they had taken with them, or sneaked out at night to search for anything that could be cooked, including cats and dogs . The army did not stop there. Its tanks went house to house in the empty village, methodically destroying each. The . smell of burned rubble lingered in the air. A legless sofa stood in . front of the El Hasna shoe store where looters left only empty shoe . boxes. An old TV set, a gold colored chandelier, a wooden bed frame and a . wrecked refrigerator littered the main Al Karamah street. Destroyed . cars stood parked inside garages of the sagging homes, their metal . shutters twisted and dotted by shrapnel. About . 300 villagers and rebels were killed in the offensive, hundreds more . were wounded while thousands managed to flee under fire across the . border to Lebanon, according to government figures. Hundreds surrendered . or were captured. Rami . Sarheed, a 23-year-old Christian from the nearby village of Nasra . however said 'a lot of people' had been 'killed by the terrorists', . adding the government offensive was necessary 'so that Syria returns to normal.' The Crac des Chevaliers, some 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of Homs and just north of the Lebanese border, caught the eye of a young T.E. Lawrence before he became Lawrence of Arabia. Lawrence lauded its beauty and called it one of the world's greatest castles. It dominates the surrounding valley and terraced hills below and once was one of the crown jewels of Syrian tourism before its three-year-old conflict began. The Crac des Chevaliers, some 40 kilometres west of Homs and just north of the Lebanese border, caught the eye of a young T.E. Lawrence before he became Lawrence of Arabia . The site of the castle was first inhabited during the 11th century by a settlement of Kurds, but was handed to the Kngihts Hospitaller who built the castle between 1142 and 1271. It held out a number of fierce attacks, including one by the Muslim warrior Saladin, before it was taken by Muslim Mamluk Sultan Baybars, in 1271, following a 36 day siege. It is like many of the country's most significant historical sites, caught in the crossfire in a conflict that activists say has killed more than 150,000 people. Some sites have been turned into military bases. Shelling has smashed historic mosques, churches and markets. Looters have stolen artifacts from excavations and museums. Journalists from The Associated Press reconstructed the battle for Crac des Chevaliers after talking to Syrian soldiers and local residents during a rare trip by Western media to the castle since its capture by government troops in March. Crac des Chevaliers was one of five Crusader fortifications protecting the Homs Gap, the major pass between Antakya in Turkey and Beirut in Lebanon. The site, which was first inhabited during the 11th century by a settlement of Kurds, was handed to the Knights Hospitaller who built the castle and expanded it between 1142 and 1271. At its peak the castle held a garrison of about 2,000 and was said to be unbreachable. With its three metre thick walls and . seven guard towers, the castle held out several fierce attacks during . the time it was occupied by the Knights Hospitaller, including one by . the Muslim warrior Saladin. The Crusader castle Crac des Chevaliers (pictured in 2006) which at its peak held a garrison of about 2,000 and was said to be unbreachable . It was eventually taken by the Muslim Mamluk Sultan Baybars, in 1271, following a 36 day siege, after they supposedly tricked the inhabitants to surrender by way of a forged letter purportedly from the Crusader Count of Tripoli. European familiarity with the Crusader castles fell after the Franks were driven from the Holy Land in 1291. A renewed interest during the 19th century however led to an investigation of the castle and architecural plans were drawn up. A settlement, which had taken residence within the castle in the late 19th or early 20th century, was removed in 1933 after causing damage to the building's fabric. It was handed over to the French state before Syria assumed control of it after declaring independence in 1946.","The Crac des Chevaliers has fallen victim to the chaos of Syria's civil war following siege by Government forces .

"By . Associated Press . and Rosemarie Lentini . The battle lines have been drawn in an environmentally-conscious Aspen community after a well-connected couple built a dance floor, 27,000-square-foot marquee and chapel on a pristine mountaintop. Colorado residents are outraged at the 'over-the-top' construction at Little Annie Basin, a meadow on the backside of Aspen Mountain where New York's Alexandra Steel and James Scott will tie the knot on Saturday. Alexandra Steel's father, Robert Steel, is the chairman of The Aspen Institute and was a senior official in the administration of former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Neighbors have complained about the traffic, carbon footprint impact and potential damage to the meadow, zoned as 'rural/remote' to conserve the natural environment. The property owner, who is also organizing the wedding, admits the event is larger than expected, but says opponents should 'live and let live'. Getting hitched: Alexandra Steel and James (pictured at a New York event in 2012) are tying the knot in an elaborate Aspen wedding on Saturday . Elaborate: A chapel, 27,000-square-foot tent and dance floor is being built on an Aspen mountaintop for the wedding of Alexandra Steel (left) and James Scott (right) The Aspen Times reported . that scaffolding flooring, service tents and other temporary structures are also being built on the meadow, requiring hundreds of trips up Little Annie Road by service trucks and employee vehicles. 'What’s happening right now is over-the-top concerning anything that’s ever happened on the Little Annie Basin,' Glenn Horn, Little Annie Homeowners Association spokesman, told The Aspen Times at Wednesday's Pitkin Board of County Commissioners meeting. 'The impacts will be felt with the vegetation and ground recovery. There’s been no traffic control on the Little Annie Road, which is designated by the county as a primitive road. 'There was no notice to the neighbors about the impact of all the activity. There’s no type of erosion control. Last week, one neighbor counted 50 huge trucks in one day accessing the road up to the basin.' Cindy Houben, director of the Pitkin County Community Development Department, said the pristine area could take years to rejuvenate after such a large-scale event. 'They’re not doing anything illegal, but the intensity of this event is extraordinary. It’s quite the ordeal,'Houben told The Aspen Times. 'There’s a lot of concern regarding the recovery of the basin after this event. It’s a sub-alpine environment. Recovery in that area could take years.' Backlash: Environmentally conscious residents are outraged a couple is building a dance floor, 27,000-square foot tent and a temporary chapel on a rural meadow at Little Annie Basin near Aspen Mountain, which they say will cause traffic and damage the area . Opposition: Residents say the scaffolding erected in preparation for the planned June 14 wedding of Alex Steel, daughter of Aspen Institute chairman Robert Steel, at the top of Little Annie Basin, near Aspen, Colorado is bad for the environment . Father: Robert Steel, Aspen Institute chairman and former NYC Deputy Mayor for Economic Development, is the father of Alexandra Steel who is getting married on Saturday in Aspen . Wedding planner John Miller, who has owned the property for 32 years, acknowledged in a letter to the editor that the wedding has turned out to be a bigger project than he originally thought. However he said the constructions were temporary and urged his neighbors to show patience . toward a family that has contributed much to the community. 'Can . we just live and let live, sit back and enjoy where we are privileged . to live?' he wrote in a letter published by the Aspen Times. Neighbors say the dispute stems from a loophole in zoning regulations. In April, wedding planner John Miller initially approached Pitkin County planning staff seeking a temporary commercial-use permit for the wedding. Staff said they didn't support the permit because 'of the scale and intensity of the operation'. However a month later, Miller wrote to the county saying the wedding would be 'free of charge' after he found out who the bride's father was. This exempted him from seeking a commercial license, according to The Aspen Times. Alexandra Steel, a Brown graduate, is the daughter of Robert Steel, chairman of the Aspen Institute and former Deputy Mayor for Economic Development for The City of New York. She and her fiance live in New York and attend numerous society events. Pete Stouffer, who has lived on the Little Annie Basin side of Aspen Mountain for 25 years, said he couldn't believe anyone involved with the Aspen Institute would be a part of such a large-scale event in a rural and remote designated area. 'I think that someone that’s had the opportunity to see the beauty, the character and will of our community and still pull something like this off is incomprehensible to me,' Stouffer said. 'This person is not unaware, and they’re still doing this. That’s what bothers me as much as this event actually happening.' Commissioner George Newman said the event shows you can be an 'ugly American' in your own country. 'It's unfortunate people come to our county because of the beauty and bring their values with them while not caring or not understanding our values,' he told the Aspen Times. County commissioners will meet June 17 to discuss zoning and permitting changes to handle future big events in the resort area.","Alexandra Steel and James Scott are getting married in Little Annie Basin near Aspen Mountain on Saturday .

"By . Katy Winter . Many young girls dream of careers, marriage, fun and happiness and endlessly plot and plan tne best ways to get what they want out of life. And though for many young women, dreams of houses and lasting love are high on the list for one Chinese woman, fulfillment lay in becoming a monk. However, in her former life Ting Tien, 24, enjoyed an affluent lifestyle full of designer clothes and make up. Ting Tien led the life of any other privileged teenage girl (left) before making the dramatic decision to give up all her possessions and become a Buddhist  monk (right) After posting a photo of herself online in her new life, Ting, pictured here with her parents, became a hit across China . But she made the decision to abandon her life of comfort and luxury in Jinan City in Eastern China and shave her head, to follow a life of, sacrifice and prayer as a Buddhist monk. It was only after graduating from Qingdao University in Shandong Province, Ting became disillusioned with the lifestyle she and her fellow career minded friends were leading, finding it increasingly materialistic. She retreated to a monastery called Xinlongdongzhi Temple, 13,000 feet up a snow covered mountain in Sichuan Province, and there, she said, she found fulfilment in the search for true enlightenment. She changed her name to Caizhenwangmu, and spends her day in prayer and meditation in a life of Buddhist spiritual fulfilment. She is surrounded by fellow monks who have shunned the material world to live their cloistered existence. It was only after graduating from Qingdao University in Shandong Province (pictured), Ting became disillusioned with the lifestyle she and her fellow career minded friends were leading . The picture she posted of herself on line led many to question why she would give up so much, to which Ting responds she needed to gain and understanding of life and death . In her previous life Ting Tien liked the same designer clothes and make up as other young woman and many have applauded her decision in a country where the pursuit of money and success is now a national mania . After posting a photo of herself online in her new life, she became a hit across China. In a country where the pursuit of money and success is now a national mania, many applauded her for choosing a different, more tranquil path in life. But there were also others who could not understand why she would give up the material world for the secular one. Responding on her Twitter account, she said: 'It is hard to answer why I choose to be a monk. Nothing bad had happened to me, and I'm not trying to escape from the world. 'I just feel a need to gain an understanding of life and death, and what it's all about. 'I'm also eager to do what I can to make the world a better place for all living creatures. What's more, believing in Buddha makes me a monk.'","Despite being privileged and well educated Ting gave up everything .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Won't apologize: Mariah Carey is pictured with her manager, Jermaine Dupri. Dupri was the person responsible for setting up a concert for the president of Angola which has now been criticized by human rights organizations . Mariah Carey angered human rights groups this week after it was revealed she accepted $1million to perform in a private concert for the president of Angola, the second-longest serving dictator in office. The singer's manager Jermaine Dupri organized the gig for President Josè Eduardo Dos Santos, and remained unapologetic when questioned by the Human Rights Foundation. Instead, Dupri pointed the blame at the Red Cross, and even said that Carey doesn't involve herself with human rights matters. Critics of Dos Santos claim he has murdered many politicians, journalists and other people who have defied orders, as well as monopolizing and exploiting oil and diamond resources and seizing control of almost all aspects of government and power. 'I don't feel like we have done anything wrong,' Dupri told the New York Post, admitting that he didn't research Dos Santos before the trip. 'The president of the United States took pictures with this guy's daughter and congratulated this man on his many years of being in office. If he can rub shoulders with these people than why is Mariah Carey being accused of doing something wrong?' Mariah's show was sponsored by Unitel, a mobile-phone company owned by Dos Santos' daughter, Isabel. Controversial: Mariah Carey, center, posed with authoritarian Angolan President Josè Eduardo Dos Santos, second from right, and his family last Sunday . Showstopper: Carey, pictured here at the performance, has come under fire after she was paid $1 million to perform for the dictator . His daughter is also head of the Angolan Red Cross, which reportedly received $65,000 in benefit funds from the concert. Dupri said that the idea for the concert was proposed by an intermediary for the Red Cross, asking 'Why don't you attack them?' He also alleged that Carey didn't even know Dos Santos was there, though she said during the performance how honored she was to share the show with the Angolan president. After the show, a professional photographer snapped Carey smiling with Dos Santos and his family. This isn't the first time that Carey has drawn heat for taking money from a shady leader. In 2008 she performed in a concert for Muammar Gadaffi, the former leader of Libya who has since been assassinated. Dictator: President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, pictured with his wife, second from right, and daughter Isabel, third from left, is accused of paying Mariah Carey with ill-gotten gains . Not again: Mariah, pictured at Sunday's concert, angered many five years after performing for notorious dictator Colonel Muammar al-Gaddafi, who was toppled and killed during the Arab Spring uprising in 2011 . After that incident, Carey pledged 'to take more responsibility' for her bookings. As for the Gadaffi incident, Dupri says he wasn't around when that happened, and can't speak about the situation. Still, he says she has no reason to be remorseful for her most recent performance. Human Rights Foundation president Thor Halvorssen spoke with Dupri over the phone this week. 'He [Dupri] said ""She is not sorry""' Halvorssen said, adding that Dupri told him that Carey is 'not involved in human rights matters'. Star power: Event promoter Karina Barbosa, pictured top left, posted pictures of the event on Instagram . 'Murderer': Critics of Dos Santos, pictured, claim he has murdered many politicians, journalists and other people who have defied his orders . Dupri denied he said any of that. 'That guys trying to twist my words and make it seem like I don't give a f*** about nothing' Dupri responded. But Halvorssen said it's clear that Dupri could care less. 'Dupri exemplifies the hypocrisy, the greed, and the willful ignorance of managers and performers who pose for photos at human rights events one day and accept copious amounts of blood diamond money on the next day,' Halvorssen said. Swanky: Barbosa posted pictures of the swanky event, and the event's poster which features Mariah . The performance comes six months after Jennifer Lopez was forced to apologize for singing 'Happy Birthday' to the repressive dictator of Turkmenistan's brutal regime. Lopez reportedly changed into a traditional Turkmen outfit during her June show and personally serenaded Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow - whose government is accused of arbitrarily arresting and torturing political dissidents. Human Rights Watch ranks Turkmenistan as 'among the most repressive in the world.'","The singer gave a two-hour concert for authoritarian Angolan President Josè Eduardo Dos Santos last Sunday, in return for the huge amount .

But in fact they show what people in the Ukrainian capital Kiev have dubbed the 'millionaires' ghost town': 42 acres of mock-19th-Century buildings that sit all but empty in the heart of the city.

"By . Associated Press . A Texas couple burned down their vacant luxury home teetering atop a crumbling 75-foot cliff over a Central Texas lake on Friday. The 4,000-square-foot house overlooks Lake Whitney, about 60 miles south of Fort Worth. The house has been condemned and owners Denise and Robert Webb evacuated the property about two weeks ago.

Homeowners Denise and Robert Webb spoke to WTSP about the decision to burn down their home. 'It's gone. It's just gone,' Denise Webb said. 'And you don't see how something that huge can just disintegrate right in front of your face.' 'It's, it's really tough -- that house was special and I don't even know why it was so special but ti was special to me,' she also said.

"By . Kate Lyons . It is strewn with rubbish, the ceilings are crumbling, and the carpets have rotted away. But when this uninhabitable dump goes under the hammer tomorrow, it looks set to sell for almost $800,000, a price which could be so high due to the overheated state of the Sydney property market. The two-bedroom art deco home in Stanmore in Sydney's inner-west has already received a huge amount of interest, with more than 150 email inquiries and 127 groups at inspections. The two-bedroom house in Durham St, Stanmore looks set to sell for close to $800,000, despite the fact that it is uninhabitable in its present state . From the outside it doesn't look too bad, though the state of the house indoors is a different matter entirely . The property needs a lot of work before it will be in a state which can be lived in . The realtor estimates that with renovations, including a new kitchen, new floors and new ceilings, the property could sell for $1.2 million . The house is still littered with garbage, despite the fact that realtors have already removed nine truckloads of rubbish from the property . 'The property had been very, very neglected and is full of junk,' said Ron Alexander, from LJ Hooker Marrickville who are selling the home. Though it is littered with broken-down appliances, old clothing, and furniture, Mr Alexander says that the house is currently in a cleaned-up state and he has already removed nine truckloads of rubbish from the property. 'It's very run-down, very basic… But it's got a hell of a lot of potential,' he said. The house is a deceased estate that has not been on the market since it was first built in the 1930s . The property is extremely neglected and it would be a huge job to renovate . The house is in a very derelict state, but is in an excellent location . There has been some interest in the property from 'brave hearts' - young couples who are keen for a renovation challenge . The house is in one of the best locations in the Sydney suburb of Stanmore . The property, at 19 Durham St, Stanmore has already attracted offers in the late $700,000s, and Mr Alexander expects to sell the property for at least that amount. 'The location is outstanding, it's in one of the best parts of Stanmore,' he said. 'The home has very strong bones.' Ninety percent of interest in the sale has come from builders and professional renovators, but he says there has been some interest from 'brave hearts' – young couples who want to take on a serious fixer-upper. The Durham Street home had a whole host of enquirers looking to purchase the property . This list still taped to the wall gives an insight into how the home was once looked after . The backyard is in an extremely unkempt state, and nine truckloads of rubbish have already been removed from the property . Mr Alexander estimates that if someone 'fixed up all the warts' of the house – putting in a new kitchen, new ceilings and polished floors – they could sell it for $1.2 million. It could go for even more if builders extended the property. The deceased estate dates back to the 1930s and it has not been on the market since it was built. The auction, which will be held tomorrow at 1pm, comes just two weeks after a run-down shack in the nearby suburb of Leichhardt sold for $980,000. The Stanmore property is a deceased estate in a derelict state with dirt and grime all over the house . The property is up for auction tomorrow afternoon and the sale price might reach $800,000, said the realtor . In many places the carpet and floors have worn through and would need replacing .

"By . Sean Poulter . Aldi is opening new stores are the rate of more than one a week ¿ 55 in 2014 - and plans to hire 5,000 staff and some 500 managers . Budget chain Aldi has been named grocer of the year, beating a raft of much bigger upmarket rivals at the industry ‘Oscars’. It is the second year in a row that the discount chain, which has led a charge on middle Britain families with the result sales are rising 35 per cent a year, has picked up the accolade. The other names on the shortlist at The Grocer Gold Awards included Asda, Waitrose, Ocado and Sainsbury’s, which yesterday revealed a disappointing fall in sales over the last three months. Aldi has grabbed millions of customers from all the big four stores – Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons – under a promise to sell high quality food and drink at budget prices. The firm claims savings of up to one third when comparing products it sells versus the big brands sold by the major supermarkets. The success of Aldi and its German rival, Lidl, has been credited with causing the biggest change in shopping habits since the rise of the national big box supermarket chains in the 1950s. All of the big four have been forced to respond by cutting prices of shopping basket essentials such as milk, bread, eggs and butter. The net result is that food price inflation is currently running at around 1 per cent which is the lowest figure for at least ten years. Sainsbury’s yesterday published figures confirming that nine years of growth has come to an end with a fall in same store sales of 1.1 per cent over the past three months compared to a year ago. Just last week, Tesco revealed its worst trading performance in 40 years amid a loss of customers to the discounters. The inside of an Aldi, which is attracting a middle class clientele .

The appeal to Middle Britain has been built on its success in a number of blind taste tests that have seen its food beating more expensive products from mainstream stores. It has been selling aged Aberdeen Angus fillet steaks at just £5 and last week introduced highly prized gourmet Wagyu beef, considered the finest in the world, at £6.99 for a sirloin steak. Tesco was named Online Supermarket of the year, while its Finest range was the best own label . Just yesterday, it emerged the chain’s Glen Orrin Malt Whisky, which costs £13.29, had won a silver medal in a blind taste testing at the International Spirits Challenge 2014. The same award went to Marks & Spencer’s Spiced Tree Whisky, which costs £40. Recently, the chain picked up awards for several products in its Specially Selected range including ultimate dry cure unsmoked British back bacon, dark chocolate and raspberry cheesecake, Italian stone baked goats cheese and spinach pizza, quiche with Wiltshire cured ham and cheese and its free range whole chicken. Tesco's Finest range was the best own label for all the supermarkets . Aldi UK’s managing director for buying, Tony Baines, said: ‘We’re thrilled to have won the Grocer of the Year for the second year running. This award is real testament to the quality products that we source from some of the best food and drink producers in the world, our everyday low pricing and our commitment to providing the best service. ‘Recognition from The Grocer Gold Awards provides our shoppers with the assurance that they are getting the best from us.’ Retail industry expert Julie Palmer said the latest figures from Sainsbury’s are testament to the pressure it is facing from budget rivals. She said: ‘While Sainsbury’s may have benefitted from customers drifting over from Tesco, it faces constant pressures from discount retailers such as Aldi and Lidl as they attempt to lure customers away. ‘The heydays are over with the food retail sector facing declining sales for the first time since 2008.’ Aldi was not the only company to leave The Grocer awards with a gong. Tesco was named Online Supermarket of the year, while its Finest range was the best own label. Asda won one for its low prices and was also named ‘Britain’s Favourite Supermarket’. Sainsbury’s won awards for customer service, product availability and was also named the green retailer of the year.","Others on shortlist at The Grocer Gold Awards included Asda, Waitrose, Ocado and Sainsbury’s .

Apology: The family shared the story on Victoria's Facebook page and KFC soon responded with an apology . Following a visit to the doctors, Victoria and her grandmother, Kelly Mullins, went into a KFC. 'I took her to the doctor and I went to KFC,' Wilcher's grandmother, Kelly Mullins, told WAPT. 'I ordered a large sweet . tea and her some mashed potatoes and gravy because she was hungry. She . was on a feeding tube at the time, but I figured she could just swallow . (the potatoes).' 'They just told us, they said, ""We have . to ask you to leave because her face is disrupting our customers"". (Victoria) understood exactly what they said.'

"By . Richard Spillett . Fifa chiefs awarded the 2022 World Cup to Qatar despite being told it had the highest risk of terrorist attack of any of the bidding countries, it was reported today. A devastating report into the security situation in the Gulf state found there was a 'high risk' of terror plots due to al-Qaeda's presence in nearby countries, it is claimed. It is believed world football's governing body handed the 2022 tournament to the Arab nation despite other countries being assessed as having a 'low to moderate risk', in a process which has since been dogged by allegations of corruption. A planned stadium for the Qatar 2022 World Cup, which is allegedly at 'high risk' of terrorist attack, it emerged today . Qatar went . up against Australia, Japan, South Korea and the US as bidding . countries to host the tournament in a process which began in 2009 and . ended in 2010, when the Middle Eastern state was awarded the World Cup. In . a series of explosive revelations in recent weeks, the Sunday Times has . reported that leaked emails cast grave doubts on the fairness of the bidding process. The . newspaper today claimed that a report by Andre Pruis, the man in charge . of security at the 2010 World Cup, found 'it would be very . difficult to deal with a major incident in such an environment [as . Qatar] without having to cancel the event'. Despite . Mr Pruis praising the security credentials of the other bidding . countries, Qatar was later awarded the tournament at a lavish . ceremony.

It was claimed today he was later given a job as chief investigator at the newly-formed International Centre for Sport Security in the Arab state. Mr .

"By . Associated Press . 'Calvin and Hobbes' creator Bill Watterson says he made a brief, unannounced return to newspaper cartooning to raise money for a good cause — and because he thought it would be funny. Watterson collaborated with 'Pearls Before Swine' cartoonist Stephan Pastis on three strips that ran this week. The strips made fun of Pastis' drawing ability, and Watterson drew one panel in each. It was the first time his art has appeared in the funnies since 'Calvin and Hobbes' ended its run in 1995. The reclusive Watterson, who lives in Ohio, told The Washington Post for Saturday's editions that he joined up with Pastis to raise money for Team Cul de Sac, a charity co-founded by cartoonist Richard Thompson that raises money to fight Parkinson's disease.

Bill Watterson (left) collaborated with Stephan Price (right) to raise money for a fellow cartoonist with Parkinson's disease . 'Several years ago, when Stephan did one of his strips that mocked his own drawing ability and mentioned my strip in comparison, I thought it might be funny for me to ghost 'Pearls' sometime, just to flip it all on its head,' Watterson said. 'It was just a silly idea, and I didn't know Stephan, so I never pursued it, and years went by.' The idea resurfaced, Watterson said, after Pastis visited Cleveland on a book tour and the charity was looking for new ways to raise money. 'I thought maybe Stephan and I could do this goofy collaboration and then use the result to raise money for Parkinson's research in honor of Richard Thompson,' Watterson said. 'It just seemed like a perfect convergence.' Pastis and Watterson did not disclose their collaboration until after the strips had run, leaving 'Calvin and Hobbes fans to speculate on blogs about Watterson's involvement. Pastis paid tribute to the final 'Calvin and Hobbes' strip in Saturday's panels. The original 'Pearls Before Swine' strips featuring Watterson's work will be auctioned off for Team Cul de Sac.

"By . Damien Gayle . A homeowner is preparing to do battle with his residents' association after it fined him $200 for flying the Betsy Ross flag outside his house. David Renner annoyed neighbours in Littleton, Colorado, when he hoisted the revolutionary-era standard with its 13 stars and stripes outside his townhouse in the run up to Flag Day. Slapping him with the fine, the Southbridge Townhomes Association told Mr Renner the only acceptable American flag is the current incarnation, which has 50 stars and 13 stripes. Don't tread on me: David Renner outside his home in Littleton, Colorado, with the Betsy Ross flag still flying in the background despite his having been fined $200 by his homeowners' association . Now Mr Renner is planning to consult an attorney, who he thinks will back up his opinion that the association is acting contrary to the 2005 Freedom to Display the American Flag Act. It's just the latest volley in a long-running dispute between Mr Renner and his homeowners' association. But he told KWGN reporter Tammy Ross he doesn't really want a fight over his flags. 'I just want to honour our history,' he said. The American flag has been redesigned 26 times since it was officially adopted on June 14, 1777. One of its first incarnations, the so-called 'Betsy Ross' flag that got David Renner in trouble with his neighbours, had 13 stars and 13 stripes to represent the 13 colonies in the original Declaration of Independence. While its origins are not well documented, a popularly accepted legend is that Betsy Ross, the wife of a militiaman, sewed it from a sketch handed to her by George Washington. However at the time the design was by no means universally used, and a number of flags loosely based on the prescribed design were used in the early years of American independence. Over the years more stars have been gradually added to the American flag to reflect the addition of new states to the union. The current flag has been in use since 1960, when Hawaii was made a state. In April Mr Renner, a flag enthusiast who . owns 13 flags, was warned by the HOA for flying the Gadsden, the . yellow, pre-revolutionary flag which proclaims 'don't tread on me'. Attempting to mollify neighbours, he took down the Gadsden - a favourite of Tea Party conservatives - and hoisted his Colorado flag instead. In May, the HOA fined him $100 in response and he took down the flag, replacing it with the Betsy Ross, an early version of the current Star and Stripes that was first adopted in 1777. It is distinctive for the circular arrangement of its 13 stars - representing the 13 colonies that originally declared independence from the UK. But in June that drew another fine, this time for $200. This time, however, Mr Renner says he won't back down, despite a letter threating further action from the homeowners' association. Mr Renner says he is growing disillusioned with the benefits offered by the association. 'What are we gaining? What are we losing?' he asked KWGN. 'Are we losing our freedom for a nice manicured lawn? I really hope we are not.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . It is not the most elegant of haircuts – as this startled-looking alpaca has probably realised. But in the hot days of summer he may be grateful to be shorn of his winter coat. The South American animal is one of two kept by Nicola and Derek Waite at Baldersbury Hill Farm near Berwick-upon-Tweed, Northumberland. Farmers use the animals to keep the grass down and deter foxes trying to get their lambs, while the alpaca clippings are sold to make clothing. The clippings can be used for luxury clothing and are worth in the region of £10 to £12 a kilo . Jackie Waugh travels up to 200 miles a day when he is shearing alpacas to keep them cool in the summer . The animals, Burns and Carruthers clipped by professional alpaca shearer Jackie Waugh, who travels up to 200 miles a day. Waugh said: 'Shearing an alpaca is not a doddle. It takes a long time to learn how to do it properly. 'It takes two people to secure one to a board. We then fleece it and check their teeth, do their nails and give them any injections they are due. 'The whole job takes between 10 and 20 minutes per alpaca, but with the relatively low numbers involved it’s not about speed. 'It’s more important that we do a good job for the owner and be as gentle as possible with the alpaca. You have to keep the alpacas calm during the shearing process. 'It’s still only early June and I have already clipped over 150 alpacas. That won’t sound much to a sheep shearer, but a lot of the jobs I do are in twos and threes, with a lot of miles to cover in-between.'

"By . Ryan Gorman . A recent college graduate biking across the country to raise money for a cancer charity was struck and killed this week by a truck. Jamie Roberts, 24, of Baltimore, Maryland, was riding through rural Kentucky with friends and several other recent grads for the Ulman Cancer Fund when the incident occurred. Five members of the contingent were on the side of a remote, winding two-lane country road about 30 miles north of Lexington at around 3.30 p.m. waiting for Roberts to change one of her tires when tragedy struck, according to reports. One of her final moments: Jamie Roberts wrote only days ago on this chalkboard as the team took a short break in Pittsburgh . ‘This is a very rural road, not much in the way of shoulders, a lot of curves and hills which again, makes it dangerous for both people, bicyclists and the vehicles involved.  It is a very troubling situation,’ Scott County Sheriff's Deputy Jearl Porter told WTVQ. Both Roberts and another rider were struck by the pickup truck, the other person suffered minor injuries, police told the Georgetown News-Graphic. Roberts was pronounced dead at the scene. Authorities are still working to determine how the driver, who remained at the scene and is cooperating with investigators, ran into them. ‘At this point we know at least some of them were off the side of the road, as to where the two that were struck were, in comparison to the roadway itself at the time of the collision is what we're still trying to determine,’ Porter told WKYT. Mowed down: Roberts' bike remained in a ditch on the side of the road hours after she was pronounced dead . Under investigation: Police are working to determine the cause of the incident while they await the results of a toxicology test on the driver . Police are working to determine if alcohol or drugs played a role in the tragedy as they await of a toxicology test performed on the driver, WTVQ reported. Roberts wrote on the Ulman Cancer Fund website that her grandfather died of lung cancer when she was only 14-years-old and that she was dedicating her ride to a friend whose parents both beat cancer in the past few years. She also wrote about being inspired to set off on the journey by two friends who completed it last year and wanting to ‘make a difference in someone’s life’ by ‘following their footsteps.’ The ‘retired’ college athlete added: ‘I am excited to face what will undoubtedly be the most difficult physical challenge of my life. I love to travel and I have a hard time saying no to adventures!’ On the trail: Roberts shown with a dog while biking through Pennsylvania . Gone too soon: Roberts only recently graduated college, she was 24-years-old . The group was 10 days into what was expected to be a 34-day trip across the country from Baltimore’s Inner Harbor to Portland, Orgeon, according to a blog written by friend Ariana Staffen. They had experiences weather-related delays in Ohio before making their way into Kentucky, but remained reasonably on schedule. ‘This passionate young woman, so precious to her family and loved ones, lost her life in a tragic accident today as she rode across America to raise funds and awareness for young adults fighting cancer,’ the fund said in a statement. ‘Jamie’s selflessness, her commitment to serving others and her deep devotion to her friends, family and fellow riders was apparent to everyone who knew her.’ Riders planned to resume riding across the country, now also in her honor, on Monday, the fund said. Roberts raised $15,246 of the $6,000 goal she had set, according to her fundraising page. Last year’s effort saw 127 riders raise almost $775,000 for young adults with cancer, the organization said.","Jamie Roberts was part of a group biking across the country from Baltimore, Maryland to Portland, Oregon .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Starbucks is rolling out a program that would allow its workers to earn an online college degree at Arizona State University at a steeply discounted rate. The coffee chain is partnering with the school to offer the option to 135,000 U.S. employees who work at least 20 hours a week. The Seattle-based company says it will phase out its existing tuition reimbursement program, which gave workers up to $1,000 a year for education at certain schools. Starbucks is rolling out a program that would allow its workers to earn an online college degree at Arizona State University, pictured, at a steeply discounted rate . The company says the program doesn't require workers to stay at Starbucks after they earn their degrees. They can also pick from a wide range of educational programs that aren't related to their Starbucks work. Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz is scheduled to announce the program Monday in New York City, with U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan and about 340 workers and their family members in attendance. It's not clear how many workers will choose to participate in the new program or how much it will cost Starbucks Corp. The company isn't disclosing the financial terms of its agreement with Arizona State University. But the program could significantly boost the enrollment for Arizona State's online program, which charges tuition of about $10,000 a year. The coffee chain is partnering with the school to offer the option to 135,000 U.S. employees who work at least 20 hours a week . That's roughly the same as the school's traditional degree program. Tuition reimbursement is a rare benefit for low-wage workers in the retail industry, but Starbucks isn't the first to offer it. In 2010, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. launched a partnership with American Public University, a for-profit, online school, to give workers and family members partial tuition grants. The retailer, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, says more than 400 of its workers have since completed degrees through the program. Wal-Mart's program also does not require workers to stay and allows them to pursue a variety of degrees. Starbucks' existing tuition reimbursement program, which was rolled out in 2011, gives workers up to $1,000 a year for courses at City University of Seattle or Strayer University. Tuition for an online degree at ASU is about $10,000 a year, roughly the same for its traditional educational programs. For . the freshmen and sophomore years, Starbucks and Arizona State say they . will put around $6,500 on average toward the estimated $20,000 in total . tuition. To cover the remaining $13,500, workers would apply for financial aid. If a worker qualified for a full Pell . grant of $5,730 a year — or $11,460 over the two years — he or she would . theoretically be left with about $2,040 to pay out of pocket. So far, Starbucks has paid out $6.5 million under that program, said Laurel Harper, a company spokeswoman. Zee Lemke, a 31-year-old Starbucks employee and union organizer in Madison, Wisconsin, said she thought the program might be useful to some workers. But she noted that prospective employers also look at where a degree was earned, and that actual in-class experience matters. As with most matters involving financial aid, the terms of the new program are somewhat complicated and will vary depending on each worker's situation.

For the freshmen and sophomore years, Starbucks and Arizona State say they will put around $6,500 on average toward the estimated $20,000 in total tuition. To cover the remaining $13,500, workers would apply for financial aid. Since Starbucks workers don't earn a lot of money, many would likely qualify for a Pell grant, said Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of EdVisors.com, a website about paying for college. If a worker qualified for a full Pell grant of $5,730 a year — or $11,460 over the two years — he or she would theoretically be left with about $2,040 to pay out of pocket. The program would work similarly for the junior and senior years, except that Starbucks would reimburse any money workers end up having to pay out of pocket. Starbucks said most of its workers have already started school, so could potentially finish off their degrees at no cost if they applied for the program. The company says the program will be available to workers at its other chains as well, including Teavana tea shops and Seattle's Best. The program is available only to workers at Starbucks' 8,200 company-operated locations. Another 4,500 U.S. locations are operated by franchisees. Kantrowitz said the new program at Starbucks has the potential to benefit all parties involved. Workers will get a chance to earn a degree in a relatively affordable way, and Starbucks could attract a better pool of workers. Arizona State University will also have a major employer potentially sending lots of students its way. ""It's a way to expand revenue,"" he said of the online programs offered by traditional, brick-and-mortar universities. Enrollment for Arizona State University's online program already stands at around 10,000.

Positioning themselves on the sand to nest, only the lapping surf and their soft groans can be heard. Professional wildlife photographer Ingo Arndt, spent 20 days in Costa Rica to capture this magnificent sight. The 45-year-old said: 'This is one of the most spectacular nature events that you can witness in the world. 'Nowhere else can you see such an enormous arribada.' Each turtle lays around 80 to 100 soft-shell eggs in a shallow nest in the sand, before heading back to the ocean. Video courtesy of The Leatherback Trust .

Prime targets for wild dogs and vultures, the locals try to protect the turtles and their eggs - collecting their own bounty in the process. For the first two days of the arribada, the locals collect eggs which would otherwise be destroyed by the late arrivals which journey across the beach. They then dedicate hours both night and day to clean the beach from driftwood and guard the turtles and their nests. Ingo, from Langen, Germany, said: 'I met the locals and they absolutely love the turtles. 'They work around the clock to protect them and I found that I could get quite close to the turtles as they are used to having people there. 'Their only concern is laying the eggs.

'So if you move very slowly, they think you are a drifting trunk and come close to rub their skin against you!' Although over 10 million eggs are laid during each cycle, only a fraction of these will hatch. And despite the best efforts of the locals, even fewer hatchlings will make it to the ocean. Yet with turtles arriving on Ostional beach all year round, the legacy of the turtles is set to continue.Ingo said: 'I was speechless when I saw the turtles first arriving - I could not believe it. 'I have seen many spectacles of nature in my career around the world but this one was very unique.

"By . Paul Collins . Former Tottenham manager Tim Sherwood turned down the West Bromwich Albion job as there were a ‘couple of ingredients missing’. The Baggies appointed Everton academy chief Alan Irvine as Pepe Mel's successor on Saturday but Sherwood, who was sacked by Spurs after a six-month spell, said he was initially offered the job. He told talkSPORT: 'I went to speak to the chairman and the board there a couple of times and was happy with how the discussions were going. Looking for the right opportunity: Tim Sherwood is still on the hunt after turning down West Brom role . 'I was offered the job before we started to negotiate. It just wasn't right for me in the end, so I decided to give it a miss. 'It is a fantastic club and it looked on the outside like it might be a perfect fit for me but unfortunately we couldn't agree for me to move forward. 'I wish them all the best and Alan in particular, someone I played with a long time ago at Blackburn.' Irvine accepted the job at The Hawthorns after agreeing to keep on coaches Keith Downing and Dean Kiely and Sherwood suggested that was one of the reasons he did not take up the offer. New West Brom boss: Alan Irvine has joined from Everton where he was the academy chief . 'I don't know Keith or Dean very well and I've got nothing against them,' he said. 'I think it is important you take your own men in and I was looking to bring in a couple of guys who I trust and who I know.

"By . Mia De Graaf . Tired: Sophie Pearl Dalzell, 20, was handed 400 hours of community service after attacking two police officers but claims she finds it 'too tiring' A glamour model who drunkenly attacked two police officers is refusing to carry out community service because it is 'too tiring' for her. Sophie Pearl Dalzell, 20, from Manchester, was ordered to 400 hours of litter-picking after the 2012 assault. Months later, she was hauled back to court for skipping probation meetings to get a second breast enlargement in Belgium. It came after she refused to wear an electronic tag for a separate offence because it interfered with her adult TV work. Now, with 180 hours of community work left to complete, Dalzell has declared she has ground to a halt because she 'just can't physically do it'. Dalzell, who has 11 previous convictions, was handed the community order, a £1,000 fine, and put on a Thinking Skills course, in May 2013. Despite completing more than half the sentence, it has now been seven months since Dalzell last picked litter - and she claims she intends to go away for summer to Ibiza. 'At the moment I am refusing to go because I hate everything about it,' she told The Sun. 'They make you work from 8am until 4pm. It's a waste of a full day and it's just too hard for me. 'I . get paid a minimum of £500 for a photoshoot and the rest of the time I . just chill out, so I don't think the courts should be able to put me on . community service because I find it too hard and tiring.' Her words come a week after she avoided a penalty and potential prison sentence for skipping her probation meetings to get a breast enlargement - her second - in Brussels. The court acquitted the model of her alleged breach after she produced a note from the surgeon. The law states that defendants can miss a probation meeting but only for a valid reason and if proof, such as a letter from a doctor or employer, is given. After being cleared at Manchester Magistrate's Court, Dalzell said: 'I'm just annoyed I have had to go through this when I haven’t done anything wrong. 'I went for a breast enlargement. They were fine about it at the time and now they have tried to breach me for it.' She was convicted last year after assaulting two police officers during a night out in Workington, Cumbria. It was months after she was ordered to wear an electronic tag when found guilty of slapping a male driver in the face and kicking his car in a row outside a Manchester nightclub. However, when security firm G4S turned up to fit her tag, she refused to let them put it on her ankle, claiming she would get the sack if she wore it. Glamour model: Last week, Dalzell defended her decision to miss probation meetings to have a breast enlargement. It came after she refused to wear an electronic tag as it interfered with her adult TV work . Convictions: Dalzell, who has 11 previous convictions, was also handed a £1,000 fine and ordered to enroll in a Thinking Skills course after her attack on two police officers in 2012 in Workington, Cumbria . Dalzell, who was working for late night TV channels at the time, was hauled back into court and fined £200. On Tuesday, magistrates told her that she still had to pay more than £150 in unpaid fines. John Morris, defending, said: 'There certainly seems to have been a breakdown in the relationship between some probation officers and the client.' Magistrates were previously told she no longer worked in adult TV and had since moved into modelling, photoshoots, hosting and other presenting jobs.","Sophie Pearl Dalzell handed 400-hour community order for assaulting police .

"By . Sam Webb . A woman who was held captive for three days by her ex-boyfriend - who sheared her hair off as their children watched TV in another room - has spoken out about her nightmare ordeal. Rebecca Watton, 29, of Hamilton, South Lanarkshire, Scotland, was in a relationship with Ian Hassen, 27, for eight years and the couple had three children together. They split in December 2012 but she remained friendly with Hassen, a Zimbabwean. The pair met through friends and moved to Scotland in 2004. However, it later emerged that Hassen refused to accept their relationship was at an end. Brutal: Rebecca Watton, 29, had all her hair clipped off by her ex-partner Ian Hassen, 27, as part of a terrifying three-day ordeal to make her 'unattractive' after their eight year relationship ended . Harrowing: The young mother's scalp following the attack by her jealous boyfriend which was carried out while their three children were in another room watching a cartoon on the television . One night Hassen looked after the children at Ms Watton's home while she went on a night out. She came home and Hassen left, but soon returned claiming he had missed his train. He then attacked her as the pair sat watching television, pulling something tight around Ms Watton's neck and then tying her up. He began interrogating her about where she had been and who she had seen. 'I knew he had read my phone messages so I confessed I had met someone on the night out who had taken my number and asked me out on a date,' she told The Daily Record. Moving forward: She has spoken out about the attack in an effort to inspire other victims of abuse to break free . Infuriated, Hassen kept her prisoner, assaulted her and threatened to kill her. He lay next to her in bed and watched her sleep. After three days he dragged her out of bed, muttering that he was going to wait a week, but was going to do 'it' now. Miss Watton thought he was going to murder her, but he instead began wordlessly clipping off her hair. 'My hair felt like it was being ripped out by the roots,' she said. 'I could feel the blades of the scissors opening and snapping shut against my scalp. He wanted to make me unattractive, like less of a woman.' She watched in tears as her hair fell to the floor, covering their daughter's toys and bed, as the children watched cartoons downstairs. She told him she wanted to vacuum the hair up, but instead he did it himself as she watched. Ms Watton claims she was aware there was an unpleasant side to her former partner, but never dreamed he could do something so savage. Ms Watton's ordeal finally ended when she convinced him to let her go to the supermarket with him and told staff what had happened to her, showing them her shorn scalp. He was arrested just outside the store. Last month, Hassen pleaded guilty to assault and will be sentenced at Hamilton Sheriff Court in July. Ms Watton has since started to move on from the assault and hopes to study law. She says she hopes her story will inspire other domestic abuse victims to break away from their abusers.","Ian Hassen attacked and tied up Rebecca Watton when he refused to accept their eight year relationship was over .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Families in Scotland are being plunged into bitter rows about independence, with another three months to go until the referendum. More than four in 10 people say their relatives are split on whether to break-up the UK, with one in five admitting discussions about Scotland going it alone have ended in a row. With both sides stepping up campaigning, 38 per cent of people fear the country will be left 'badly divided' whatever the outcome of the vote. Voters in Scotland will have their say on independence in the referendum on September 18. Much of the focus has been on the debate between politicians, with Alex Salmond pushing his dream of independence while the likes of George Osborne, Alistair Darling and Gordon Brown warn of the dangers. But a new opinion poll reveals how the arguments are not confined to politicians, but are being played out around the dinners tables of Scotland. The ICM poll for Scotland on Sunday found 38 per cent of those surveyed think Scotland will be left badly divided after September 18, whatever the outcome, while 36 per cent disagreed. More than two in five (42 per cent) said members of their family have different views on whether Scotland should be independent, while 38 per cent did not. Just over a fifth (21 per cent) said conversations about Scottish independence with family and friends have ended in a row, while 69 per cent disagreed. The study also showed that the gap between Yes and No has narrowed, while a poll for Yes Scotland showed support for independence has reached a 'campaign high' of 48 per cent. The ICM poll of 1,003 people found support for independence is at 36 per cent, two percentage points up on an equivalent poll last month. Support for the No vote dropped three percentage points to 43 per cent compared to May's equivalent poll, while 21 per centwere undecided, up one point. When undecided voters were excluded, support for Yes was 45 per cent, three points up on last month. Backing for a No vote was 55 per cent, down three points. At the same time, a Yes Scotland poll, conducted by Panelbase, found 43 per cent of those surveyed backed a Yes vote, while 46 per cent supported No and 12 per cent were undecided. When those undecided were excluded, support for independence stood at 48 per cent while backing for a No vote was at 52 per cent. The poll of 1,060 people also asked how they would vote if the 2015 UK general election was going to result in a Conservative-led government, or another Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition at Westminster. Almost half (49 per cent) said they were likely to vote for Scottish independence, while 41 per cent said they were unlikely to do so. When don't knows were excluded, the result was 55 per cent for Yes and 45 per cent for No. Asked about the scenario of a Labour-led government at Westminster, 45 per centsaid they were likely to vote for independence while 45 per cent said they were unlikely to do so. When don't knows were excluded, the split was 50/50.","With three months to go until the referendum, tensions rising in families .

"By . Christian Gysin . and Martin Robinson . The wife of injured England physio Gary Lewin has today blamed his broken ankle on Brazilian groundsmen who watered astroturf in front of the dugout. Maggie Lewin, 51, said her husband was 'disappointed' to fly home from the World Cup early after he was injured celebrating Daniel Sturridge's goal against Italy in Manaus on Saturday night. England’s own physio had jumped in delight only to dislocate his ankle and also break his tibia and fracture his fibia, Mrs Lewin said. The 50-year-old was in agony as he received treatment from both FIFA officials and players on the sideline before . he was carried down the tunnel on an orange stretcher. Mrs Lewin admitted she felt 'slightly sick' as she and millions of others saw her husband badly hurt.

The artificial turf was wet where the groundsmen had . been spraying. 'He's hopefully being operated on tomorrow night. Just really . gutted for him. He's broken the end of his tibia and fractured the end . of his fibula.' The Brazilian groundsmen at the Arena Amazonia have already been widely criticised for the state of the pitch for England's crucial first group game. Photographs taken during and after the game showed the surface was lifting dangerously and the loose turf could have led to serious injury. Just hours before the match ground staff were putting the finishing touches to the pitch as they tried to cover up dry grass by painting the brown patches green. Explaining what happened to Mr Lewin an England source said: ‘Gary leapt into the air as Sturridge scored and everyone was leaping about,’ said one England source. The physio was said to be ‘gutted’ after being stretchered off from the side of the pitch in Manaus on Saturday night. A . source said: ‘On the flight home a few of the lads joked with him that . he was the one supposed to be looking after them – not the other way . round. ‘As soon as it happened Frank Lampard was one of the first  players who went to help him. ‘Gary has been a little sheepish about the whole thing.’ England manager Roy Hodgson confirmed Lewin, 50, had suffered a fractured and dislocated ankle. He said: ‘Our doctor was able to set it in the . sense he was able to put it back at the side of the field, but it is the . end of the World Cup for him I’m afraid.'

'But when we went to get off I had only got the front of the pram off the bus and I was still taking the back end off when the driver pulled away. 'Everybody on the bus was screaming and shouting for him to stop.' The incident happened at around 11.20am on Wednesday and was witnessed by at least six passengers.

The mayor of Belfast has hit back at a Game of Thrones TV executive who said that the city - where much of the series is filmed - is 'not the most cosmopolitan of cities to spend half the year'. HBO, the company behind Game Of Thrones, based on the novels of George RR Martin, works closely with the city to encourage visitors to Northern Ireland. The filming locations feature prominently on websites promoting Belfast as a travel destination.

Belfast Mayor Nichola Mallon defended the city . There is even a Game of Thrones exhibit in the city, where visitors can see props and costumes from the show. But HBO's president of programming Michael Lombardo told U.S. magazine Vulture that producers Dan B Weiss and David Benioff were struggling to adapt to life there. He said: 'It's a little bit of a personal challenge I don't think they contemplated when we initially found our location in Belfast, what that meant for them personally... Belfast is not the most cosmopolitan of cities to spend half of the year.' Downhill Beach in Coleraine doubled as Dragonstone, home of Stannis Baratheon . A key scene involving Stannis Baratheon and his otherworldly advisor Lady Melisandre was filmed on the Londonderry beach . He added: 'I don't think they have a hard time, but the good news is work keeps them busy, let's just say that.' Belfast's new Lord Mayor Nichola Mallon defended her city, saying it has been transformed and much to offer holidaymakers. 'I don't want to get drawn into attacking HBO, who are doing a lot for Northern Ireland, but I think Belfast is a very vibrant city,' she told the Belfast Telegraph.

"By . Paul Donnelley . To commemorate the centenary of the First World War, the editors of the Oxford English Dictionary have selected 100 words first recorded in, popularised during, or coined as a result of the Great War. Surprisingly, the term First World War was recorded two months before the end of the conflict in a diary entry from 10 September 1918. Most would think that the term did not appear until the Second World War when the scale of the first war became apparent. The term First World War was recorded two months before the end of the conflict in a diary entry from 10 September 1918 . A number of terms which are now mainly associated with the Second World War are shown to date back to the First, including demob (1918), foxhole (1915 in the military sense), and strategic bombing (1918). The word cootie, meaning a body louse, originated in the trenches in 1917. New research shows that coot meaning ‘louse’ and cooty meaning ‘infested with lice’ were used earlier in the war, in 1915. All are ultimately related to the bird called a coot: the phrase as lousy as a coot (referring to the reputation of these birds for being lice-infested) dates back to the 19th Century. The word cushy was borrowed from Urdu by the British military in India; the first recorded use in English is by Rudyard Kipling in 1887, in the sense ‘easy-going’. The Yorkshire & Lancashire Regiment off the Front Line. A number of terms which are now mainly associated with the Second World War are shown to date back to the First, including demob (1918), foxhole (1915 in the military sense), and strategic bombing (1918) The term became widespread in the First World War, first in military slang, then in general colloquial usage, in a variety of senses including ‘easy’ and ‘comfortable’. German was largely the source of loanwords referring to weapons and vehicles, such as minenwerfer (and the diminutive Minnie), and U-boat. By contrast, the influence of French was more idiosyncratic; many of the French words used by soldiers at the front were informal phrases that were mispronounced forms of common French expressions, such as Alleyman (from Allemand, ‘a German’), no bon (‘no good’), toot sweet – or even the tooter the sweeter (from tout suite, ‘straightaway’). Viva la France: Many of the French words used by soldiers at the front were informal phrases that were mispronounced forms of common French expressions, such as no bon (¿no good¿) and the tooter the sweeter (from tout suite, ¿straightaway¿) Sir James Murray, the first editor of the Oxford English Dictionary, in his Scriptorium at Banbury Road, Oxford .

"By . Sophie Borland, Health Correspondent . Jan Filochowski, who was given the payment on top of his £245,000 salary while in charge of West Hertfordshire NHS Trust . An NHS boss was handed a £45,000 bonus – despite presiding over a scandal in which 800 suspected cancer patients were wrongly discharged from his hospital. Jan Filochowski was given the payment on top of his £245,000 salary in the same year two people died and hundreds had their lives put at risk by the mistake. He is one of a number of senior executives who have enjoyed extraordinary pay rewards at a time when the health service is facing unprecedented financial strain. A damning report shows NHS directors received pay rises at four times the rate of frontline staff in the past two years. Several earn over £200,000 a year – much more than the Prime Minister’s £142,500 salary. Yesterday, critics questioned why Mr Filochowski was entitled to the bonus and called for him to take responsibility for the blunders. He was in charge of West Hertfordshire NHS trust when 810 patients suspected of having cancer were wrongly discharged between 2010 and 2013 due to administrative errors. At least two died as a result after failing to turn up for appointments, which delayed their diagnosis. A review by the trust – which runs hospitals in Watford, St Albans and Hemel Hempstead – admitted patients had been let down by administrative failures spanning three years. Mr Filochowski left to become chief executive of London’s Great Ormond Street Hospital in February last year but resigned in December, two months before the scandal came to light. The married father of two, 62, now runs a consultancy firm called Healthcare Alliance which advises NHS trusts on how to improve their performance and leadership. Richard Harrington, Tory MP for Watford, said: ‘He should be held to account and he should take responsibility. The public needs to know on what grounds this bonus was awarded. It was a failure of management and the person at the top needs to take responsibility. One death is one too many.’ Eleven NHS directors have been given pay rises of 15 per cent or more in the last year, said the report by the Royal College of Nursing (RCN). Meanwhile, the health service faces one of its toughest periods of financial austerity due to the cost of caring for an ageing population. Over the last four years it has frozen salaries of many of its staff. Figures obtained by the RCN from hospitals under the Freedom of Information Act show nurses and midwives’ pay rose by 1.6 per cent over the last year, well below inflation. But executives’ average wage packets have grown by 6.1 per cent in the last two years. The RCN found West Hertfordshire, presided over by Mr Filochowski, had one of the worst bonus cultures of all NHS trusts. Its former medical director, Dr Colin Johnston, was awarded up to £30,000 on top of his £130,000 salary. He also left last year to work for a private healthcare firm. Dr Peter Carter, general secretary of the RCN, said: ‘The Government has maintained an iron grip on the pay and benefits of frontline staff while the senior managers’ pay bill has seemingly gone unchecked. Karen Jackson, chief executive of Northern Lincolnshire and Goole NHS trust, whose salary rose by £25,000 last year . ‘This is the worst kind of double standard and makes a mockery of their insistence that fairness has been at the heart of their decision making on public sector pay.’ Dia Chakravarty of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘It is ridiculous that NHS managers are being given these extortionate pay rises when frontline medical staff have had their pay frozen.’ A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘We have an available budget of nearly £1billion for pay increases. ‘We have offered to look at any proposal the unions make on how to use this money. However they have not put forward any proposals to help the lowest paid.’ West Hertfordshire NHS trust confirmed Mr Filochowski’s salary and bonus, although it is not known on what grounds it was awarded.","Jan Filochowski was given a £45,000 bonus on top of his £245,00 salary .

"Two divers have died after getting into trouble in the English Channel. The men, aged in their 40s, were diving off Eastbourne this afternoon, Sussex Police said. The coastguard was called at around 1.30pm following a mayday call from the dive boat. Two divers died after getting in to difficulty in the English Channel. Their boat was stationed several miles off the coast of Eastbourne, pictured, when they got in to trouble, police confirmed . Some reports have suggested the two may have fallen unwell with the Bends - the decompression sickness that can effect divers as they rise to the surface. A Coastguard Rescue Helicopter and the Trinity House vessel 'Patricia' sped to the scene. The two victims were hoisted aboard the helicopter after a rescue bid in the water, which involved the crew from their own boat and the Trinity House launch. They were taken to Eastbourne District General Hospital where they later died, police have now confirmed. Detective Chief Inspector Mark Ling said: 'Tragically two divers have died after getting into difficulty while diving in the Channel. 'We are informing their families and will be conducting an investigation into the circumstances.' A spokesman for the Coastguard said: 'Dover Coastguard has been assisting a dive boat this afternoon after two of its divers experienced difficulties during a dive mid channel, south of Eastbourne. The two divers were airlifted to Eastbourne District General Hospital by Coastguard rescuers. The men, in their 40s, are yet to be named .

There were 10 people diving on board, and the dive master on the boat as well.’ The divers are yet to be named.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The time it takes to switch electricity and gas suppliers will be halved under proposals by energy regulator Ofgem. From December 31, switching times will fall to two-and-a-half weeks – three days plus a 14-day cooling-off period. And today, the watchdog published plans to introduce next-day switching by 2018. Welcome news: The time it takes to switch suppliers will be halved under proposals by energy regulator Ofgem . Around 62 per cent of people have never switched energy supplier, Ofgem revealed. They could save up to £200 a year, it said. Ofgem chief executive Dermot Nolan said: 'Consumers can change their bank in seven days, their mobile phone . in just a couple, but have to wait significantly longer to switch their . energy supplier.' ‘We hope this will give consumers more confidence to start shopping around.’ Currently switching takes five weeks, including a statutory two-week cooling-off period that came into force in June. 'Consumers can change their bank in seven days, their mobile phone in just a couple, but have to wait significantly longer to switch their energy supplier' Ofgem chief executive Dermot Nolan . The regulator has been working with . energy suppliers and the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) to speed up switching times. Ofgem’s . additional proposals to introduce next day switching by 2018 at the . latest will still include the 14-day cooling off period, but this will . begin after a customer has changed supplier. Next day switching will be made possible by the upgrading of old IT systems first developed in the 1990s, said Ofgem. The . latest figures from the DECC show that 1.3million electricity . customers and 866,000 gas customers changed supplier in the final three months of 2013. Industry group Energy UK said it welcomed the move. Energy tariff prices are in a constant merry-go-round with suppliers battling to pinch customers - you - from each other. Shrewd consumers can take advantage of this by doing exactly that - moving deals every six months to a year to ensure they are on THE cheapest deal. Even moving every other year will save you significant amounts. Suppliers offer their cheapest rates via online tariffs so if you're ready to switch, it will certainly pay to do so. If you are one of the millions of people who have NEVER switched (i.e. stuck with your original supplier), then you will DEFINITELY save a big chunk of cash, possibly as much as £300 a year. Prices are different all over the country and the cheapest supplier for you will depend where you live. You only need to be interested in the tariff that is going to be cheapest where you live, so do your own comparison to find the best price.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A new poll says Bill Clinton is the most admired president of the last 25 years by a wide margin. In a Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Annenberg Survey Clinton was named most admired by 42 per cent of respondents. Coming in second with 18 per cent was Barack Obama, followed by George W. Bush at 17 per cent and George H.W. Bush at 16 per cent. Former President Bill Clinton was named most admired president of the last 25 years by 42 per cent of recent poll respondents . Following behind Clinton in the poll were current president Barack Obama at 18 per cent and George W. Bush at 17 per cent . The Wall Street Journal reports that 1,238 adults responded to the poll from June 2-8. There is a margin of error of plus or minus 2.8 per cent. The Wall Street Journal noted that the poll results were a reflection of how much Clinton had done to polish his image since leaving the White House in 2000. The survey is part of a series of polls done as a collaboration between the news organizations and the Annenberg Public Policy Center, based at the University of Pennsylvania. The poll is the latest evidence that the Clinton's are America's most popular political figures at the moment. That poll along with one supporting Hillary Clinton in a 2016 presidential bid indicate the Clintons are America's most popular political couple . A poll released in May showed that 55 per cent of responders said they would vote for Hillary Clinton as presidential candidate in 2016, the Washington Post reports. Her support is even higher than Obama's current approval ratings. Bill Clinton's potential as First Husband seems to help.

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . Police in Connecticut say a hoarder has died after the cluttered first floor of her home collapsed into the basement. Authorities . say 66-year-old Beverly Mitchell was found dead in her Cheshire home . Saturday, a day after a postal carrier called police to request a . welfare check because her mail was piling up. Cheshire police tell the Record-Journal that the first floor appeared to collapse under the weight of clutter . stacked to the ceiling, and Mitchell was found in the basement under a . pile of debris. The home of a Connecticut hoarder (not pictured here) was so full the floor collapsed sending her falling to her death . 'The floor gave way and collapsed into the basement. The contents of that room caved in on top of her,' Sgt. Kevin . O’Donnell told the press. 'We did a well being and we determined it wasn’t . safe to continue searching and asked for assistance when we saw the . first floor collapsed,' he added. 'We contacted Connecticut . Homeland, who brought special equipment for search and rescue.' Authorities cut their way into the home through a side wall. State officials also responded to the scene. They finally found her body on Saturday. 'She was a hoarder,' said O’Donnell. 'This was an accidental death caused by disrepair.' The chief medical examiner's office will be performing an autopsy. Hoarders amass massive amounts of junk making it hard for authorities to search the scene (not picutured) O'Donnell said authorities had attempted to reach out to her for years, but that she had a long history of reclusive behavior and shunned contact with the outside world aside for occasional shopping trips or visits to senior services. Her home had even been boarded up. 'She was a recluse,' he said. 'We weren’t sure she was in the building' Police and social service agencies had tried for years to help Mitchell, O’Donnell said.","Authorities found  66-year-old Beverly Mitchell was found dead in her Cheshire home .

"By . Dan Bloom . They are some of the brightest minds in the country, but these students at Cambridge University couldn't resist causing a bit of chaos as they took to the river in cardboard box boats. Hundreds of people cheered on more than 30 cider-drinking teams as they marked the end of their exams - known to them as Suicide Sunday - with a boisterous parody of the Oxford-Cambridge boat race. Some of the flimsy vessels cobbled together with card, glue and gaffer tape made it to the end of the half-mile course, but most sank along with their beaming captains straight into the River Cam. Messing around in boats: Thirty teams of Cambridge University students took to the river in cardboard boxes as part of a booze-fuelled celebration of the end of term . Brainboxes: Some of the flimsy crafts fell apart around their captains - but others made it to the end of the half-mile course with the help of paddles and ping pong bats . Man overboard! The vessels were cobbled together using cardboard boxes, glue and gaffer tape for Suicide Sunday, a rowdy celebration of the end of exams . Oh no! Three students realised they had lost the race in the most awkward - and coldest - way possible, tipping into a busy section of the River Cam in the city centre . High spirits: Those who lost the race swam back to the shore and picked up a beaker of beer instead as families looked on bemused from the river banks . The teams with names like The Oar of Babylon, Black Pearl and Popeye's Pride spent the morning constructing their homemade rafts on Jesus Green in the centre of the historic city. They then tried to race their rafts along the Backs, a section of river named for the historic colleges which back onto it, for half a mile to Magdalene Bridge. Other students clapped and cheered from the bank as they watched the contestants, homemade oars and dinner trays in hand, try to balance beakers of beer on the sides of their wobbly boats. The sturdier boats included multiple layers of tape over stronger cardboard tubes - but other contestants were forced to bail out straight away as their soggy models dissolved around them. They wore crowns, wigs and pirate hats, and one group of students even designed their . vessel to look like a dragon with a head at the front and a tail at . the back. Most of the boats had three or four passengers, but one sturdy vessel managed to . accommodate eight as it whistled past a wooden punt full of . tourists. Boozy: Students multi-tasked by sipping on cans of Fosters lager as they tried desperately to stay afloat. The River Cam is also popular with tourists on traditional punts . Water sight: The teams' names included The Oar of Babylon, Black Pearl and Popeye's Pride and they spent the morning constructing their boats on Jesus Green . Nothing to sea here! A group of students try in vain to right their capsized craft - as their competitors sail by effortlessly in bright green fluffy wigs . It's a bit boxy in here: These students clutched their drinks between their teeth as they used improvised paddles made out of tennis rackets to compete in the race . The sturdier boats included multiple layers of tape over stronger cardboard tubes - but other contestants were forced to bail out straight away from their soggy models . Costume party: Some of the racers wore pirate hats as they crammed into their boxes, while others had a more leisurely time on rafts made from cardboard tubes . That's not an oar! In lieu of official paddles, some of the students appeared to have swiped dinner trays from their colleges. The event kicks off May Week in the city . Surely that's cheating! Some of the competitors were more organised and laid their hands on real oars - while one shrewdly put diving flippers onto his arms . The winning team of three male students flew to the finishing line with no competitors in sight. The . team, called HMS Neil, consisted of Churchill College students Chris . Rosier and Peter Dawes, both 22 and in their final year staying . engineering and Kenny Wiles, also 22 and in his final year studying . maths. 'It took five days, an entire kilometre of gaffer tape and 11 cardboard tubes,' said Mr Rosier. 'We were quietly confident it would last but we weren't sure it would win. Other people were confident we would win though.' Not everyone saw the funny side - as with many boozy events at Cambridge, some spectators rushed their children away from the screaming students. One . mother-of-two, who did not wish to be named said: 'It's very noisy and . it is a bit intimidating for my children especially as they're all . drinking in the middle of the day.' Another group of students set their boat alight as they reached the finishing line, with cardboard strewn across the grass while students began downing . pitchers of beer. Fun: The annual event to mark the end of exams attracted hundreds of people who watched from the bridges and river banks in the centre of Cambridge . A member of the winning team said: 'It took five days, an entire kilometre of gaffer tape and 11 cardboard tubes... We were quietly confident it would last' Hakuna Matata! Other team names at the crowded event included The Oar of Babylon, Black Pearl and Popeye's Pride . Precarious: Three students clutch their drinks in a show of optimism as they cling to the last vestiges of their cardboard box boat during Suicide Sunday . The boat race was among a number of . parties to mark the beginning of May . Week, in which students attend daily balls and garden parties to end the . academic year on a high. The race was held at the same time as hundreds of students attended the annual Wyverns' Garden Party, organised by the notorious Wyverns' Drinking Society. The 85th annual party saw thousands of students drinking in celebration in a private location a few miles from the city, after it had to be moved when officials banned students from holding the event on university land. The . drinking society is based at Magdalene College, whose former alumni . include Downton Abbey writer Julian Fellowes, the diarist Samuel Pepys and war correspondent John Simpson. A spokesman for the University of Cambridge advised students to be careful in May Week after trouble in previous years, saying: 'Students are frequently advised by their colleges to . look after themselves, their friends and their valuables when out . socialising.' But Mr Rosier defended the boat race, saying it was 'just a bit of fun.' He added: 'It's for students who have worked extremely hard all year and deserve to have some fun.' Scrapheap challenge: The preparations began early on Sunday morning on Jesus Green, in the centre of the historic university city . Students of everything from engineering and maths to literature and history turned their brains to something more simple - making things out of cardboard .","Students at 805-year-old institution celebrated exams' end with boisterous parody of Oxford-Cambridge boat race .

Fake  Nike, Converse and . Adidas trainers are sold for £25 a pair, and Mulberry, Louis Vuitton, . Prada and Chanel all sell for well under £35. The 20 shops reportedly operate on a 'spotter system' - whereby a lookout will stand outside the shuttered shop front and use mobile phones to alert colleagues inside if police are near. While most of the business comes from those buying in bulk, individual shoppers also visit the underworld factory to buy fake handbags, sunglasses and sports gear.

"By . Charles Sale . Follow @@charliesale . A major row has broken out between sports brand giants Nike and adidas over the leisure clothing England players have been wearing on the World Cup trip. Adidas realise there is nothing they can do about their contracted footballers, who include captain Steve Gerrard, wearing the official three lions kit on and off the pitch as arch-rivals Nike have the supply contract until 2018. But adidas are furious the vast wardrobe of gear Nike provide includes heavily branded clothing with little or no obvious England logos. Poached: adidas are unhappy with contracted players (such as Frank Lampard) wearing Nike apparel with no England badge in sight . They were first alerted when the players went out in Miami wearing white T-shirts emblazoned with Nike FC in gold lettering but no three lions or flag of St George visible on the garments. And Nike have at least three personnel around the England team making sure the swoosh is always evident. A spokesman for adidas, who also have Leighton Baines, Gary Cahill, Luke Shaw,  Phil Jagielka, Frank Lampard and the recently-signed Rickie Lambert in their England stable, said: ‘This is a massive issue for us and it’s very naughty what Nike are doing.’ Adidas say they have contacted agents of their players to ask for their support in the protest to the FA with a legal battle looking likely. Nike were unavailable for comment. Contracted: Lampard poses for an adidas photo last year... the sports manufacturer may threaten legal action . Roy Hodgson is fortunate to enjoy the full support of his bosses at the FA — to the extent there is no inclination to change the popular manager even if England exit the World Cup at the group stage. But public opinion would make it untenable for Roy to remain in charge were England to lose to Uruguay on Thursday, sealing their fate after two games. The England and Wales Cricket Board were insistent that Andy Flower would stay on after the Ashes whitewash, but managers just cannot survive national team humiliation on that scale. A comparable sporting fiasco — or worse — is to be sent packing from Brazil after 180 minutes following a month of money-no-object preparation. Support: Roy Hodgson will still be England manager, regardless of the end result at the World Cup . Thierry Henry, a BBC pundit on Saturday night, criticised Italy striker Mario Balotelli for raising a finger to his lips in the shush gesture to England fans after scoring the decisive second goal. Yet this is the same Henry who made the signal one of his own trademark goalscoring celebrations. The Mixed Zone is where players walk through after games to face the media. However, the FA’s policy in this supposedly free-for-all environment is to decide in advance who answers questions. Leighton Baines said after the Italy defeat: ‘There are names up of the lads that are stopping.’ However, one non-stage-managed sighting was Jack Wilshere carrying the bags of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to save his team-mate’s injured knee from unnecessary stress. Orders: The England players are told who will be going to the Mixed Zone to give interviews at the World Cup . Burton has fill of Phil . Among the army of Twitter critics about Phil Neville’s unhappy debut as BBC’s live England match co-commentator was Sky football pitchside reporter Andy Burton, a TV colleague of Phil’s brother Gary. Burton, who will have riled his sensitive Isleworth bosses, tweeted that Neville should ‘liven up’, retweeted other negative comments before encouraging viewers to tune into Radio 5 Live’s commentary instead. Phil, who always prepares for every role professionally, would not have liked having to hang around for five hours in the Amazonia Arena media centre, where he tried to have a nap before his high-pressure role with 15.6million tuning in. BBC say Phil will continue to play a key role, co-commentating on BBC highlights of England’s next two games. But they have not yet made plans for the last 16, when they will next cover England live if they get through. Not up to it: Phil Neville was heavily criticised for his commentating on the BBC on Saturday night . News agency Reuters have warned staff about criminal gangs gaining entry into media areas in the stadiums. This follows the theft of £20,000 worth of equipment from  inside the press centre at Belo Horizonte. One snapper, who had a camera and lens stolen, had left his equipment unguarded while he went to a nearby canteen to buy a packet of crisps.","adidas may threaten legal action, with spokesman calling Nike: 'Naughty.'

Scott Ellis, 42, was later arrested on suspicion of murder at Ipswich Hospital where he was being treated for injuries to his wrists . The body of a 39-year-old mother was found by police after a neighbour raised the alarm because her family was worried about her. Jane Bartholomew was discovered at her house in Martlesham Heath near Ipswich, Suffolk, on Friday night. A post-mortem by a Home Office pathologist confirmed she had died of 'significant head injuries'.

"By . Leon Watson . Rik Mayall's 2010 World Cup song has gone straight into the top ten of the UK singles chart after a social media campaign in his memory. The track, which was originally recorded for the last World Cup, failed to chart the first time around, but thanks to support online it has gone in at number seven. Actor and comedian Mayall, who died last Monday, said of the track in 2010: 'Football chants are one of the great traditions of following football and Shakespeare is also part of our national heritage. Push for number one: DJ Jon Morter has urged people on Facebook to get the comedian's 'lost World Cup track Noble England (video pictured) to the top of the charts. It has gone in at number 7 . 'It seemed only natural that they should go together. 'I'm doing my bit, just like every other Englishman. As we stand shoulder-to-shoulder, doing out bit, stiff upper lip - apart from when you're screaming out the lyrics to Noble England.' The campaign to get the song into the charts was kicked off by Jon Morter - the man behind Rage Against The Machine's victory over X Factor winner Joe McElderry in the 2009 Christmas number one race, the Official Charts Company said. Mayall suffered from an 'acute cardiac event' after returning from a morning run, his widow said this week. Barbara Mayall said her family had received 'thousands and thousands of messages of condolence' from around the world. She said: 'We always knew that Rik was well loved but we are all overwhelmed by so many joining us in our grief.' Patriotic: The song includes the re-enactment of speeches made by Henry VII. The track has jumped in the charts and his now at number 7 . Heartbroken: His wife Barbara (left) said he suffered an 'acute cardiac event' after he returned to his home. The family of the actor and comedian are pictured at a London screening of Churchill, The Hollywood Years in 2004 . Meanwhile, former X Factor contestant Ella Henderson has described going straight in at number one on the official singles chart as 'incredible'. And the official anthem of the World Cup, We Are One (Ole Ola), by Pitbull, Jennifer Lopez and Claudia Leitte is at 29. More than 132,000 copies of Henderson's single Ghost were purchased in the UK over the last seven days, earning the 18-year-old from Tetney in Lincolnshire the fourth fastest selling single of the year so far, according to the Official Charts Company's sales data.

Ghost was co-written by OneRepublic frontman Ryan Tedder, who has also penned tracks for the stars such as Leona Lewis, Ellie Goulding, Beyonce and Adele. Speaking about her achievement, Henderson told OfficialCharts.com: 'It feels incredible. I just can't believe it. I've taken my time away, writing, and coming back into it with all this support is amazing. 'When you think about the people Ryan works with, it was definitely overwhelming being in the same room as him. He gets to pick and choose who he works with, and to say I got to write my first single with him is insane.' Ed Sheeran slides one place to number two with Sing, while Tiesto is new in at number three with Wasted FT Matthew Koma. It is the Dutch DJ's highest charting UK single to date. The top five is completed by Stay With Me by Sam Smith at four and Waves by Mr Probz at five. Meanwhile, Kasabian have ended Sam Smith's two-week stand at number one on the official albums chart with their album 48:13. Coldplay hold firm at number two for a third week with Ghost Stories, while Smith's In The Lonely Hour is down two to number three.

'Over the years I have loved photographing fathers with their children. I hope they portray the tenderness and kindness all children deserve from their fathers,' he reflected in a blog called 'On Fathers and Fatherhood'.

"By . Ryan Lipman . Convicted armed robber John Killick has lost his NSW Supreme Court battle against extradition to Queensland. Justice Carolyn Simpson has upheld an extradition order to send Killick north of the border. 'I left myself open for this, but you've got to deal with what you've done in the past,' he told reporters on Thursday. Convicted armed robber John Killick has lost his NSW Supreme Court battle against extradition to Queensland and could serve the remaining two-and-a-half-year balance of a sentence imposed for an armed robbery in 1983 . 'The past is catching up but it's been great being out, and I've still got a chance.' The 72-year-old, who made a brazen escape from a Sydney prison in a helicopter hijacked by his then girlfriend Lucy Dudko in 1999, will be sent back to Queensland over an alleged breach of bail 21 years ago. He must report to Queensland Police by June 27, and could be forced to serve the two-and-a-half-year balance of a sentence imposed for an armed robbery in 1983. Killick's lawyer Eidan Havas said he would be looking for potential avenues for appeal. He said he was also working with a solicitor in Queensland to seek a judicial review of the cancellation of Killick's parole. In 1999, Killick's then girlfriend Lucy Dudko, pictured, hijacked a helicopter to get him out of Sliverwater jail . But both men were prepared for Thursday's decision. 'Although we were optimistic and hopeful, we weren't surprised with today's decision,' Mr Havas said. 'He was prepared for this, and he's prepared since day one to go to Queensland and do the time if required.' Killick remains on bail but must wear an electronic ankle monitor and report to NSW police daily. 'The longer I'm out, the more I'm feeling human again, after all that long time,' he said. '(My wife) was just hoping for the best. But we know this ordeal will be over soon.' At the time of his escape from Silverwater jail, pictured, Killick was serving time for armed robbery . Killick gained international notoriety when he went on the run for 45 days in 1999 after Ms Dudko hijacked a helicopter at gunpoint and had it flown to the Silverwater prison exercise yard, where Killick was serving time for armed robbery. He jumped in the chopper and flew off amid cheers from other inmates and gunshots from prison guards. After being recaptured, he went back to prison until April this year, when he was granted parole. Immediately after his release, Queensland authorities produced a warrant for the pensioner's arrest and sought his extradition. Queensland Police claim Killick breached his parole in 1993 after an offence of violence armed with a dangerous weapon but his legal team had branded their warrant an abuse of process.","John Killick has lost court battle against extradition to Queensland .

It has emerged that Garcia quizzed England 2018 officials  during interviews in London last year about them  picking up the whopping  £35,000 bill  for a Trinidad dinner for 160 people from the  Caribbean  Football Union  in Port of Spain in February 2010. The event was part of a flawed effort  to woo  the influential  former FIFA vice-president Jack Warner, who has since quit football in disgrace  following his  cash for votes involvement in Mohamed bin Hammam’s  aborted bid for the FIFA presidency. Probe: Michael Garcia, Chairman of the Ethics Committee, is leading FIFA's investigations over the World Cup bidding process . There was no secret about England 2018 picked up what looks like an inflated dinner  tab with Warner saying on the eve of the bash : 'It is costing the FA about £35,000, but I think it is money well spent as it allows them to speak to all 32 countries from the CFU. 'It also means I will be able to get the collective view of my membership about who they think should host the World Cup when the time comes for me to decide. And in light of the harsh economic conditions we are battling in the region, the FA has agreed to formally partner with us.' Making a meal of it! Gala dinner was an effort to woo former FIFA vice president Jack Warner . At the time England 2018 said the £35,000 payment would allow the CFU to spend the money they save on football projects.  The sum is just a fraction of the £1m Qatar spent sponsoring the Confederation of African Football’s   Congress . New York attorney Garcia’s report into the bidding process of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups  is due to be delivered to FIFA next month. There has been speculation that he will not single out  one bidding country  but say all of them breached regulations in various ways. England 2018 were eliminated from the World Cup bid in the first round, winning just two votes, one of which came from Geoff Thompson, the English representative on the voting FIFA ExCo.","Michael Garcia is leading FIFA's investigations into allegation of corruption in the World Cup bidding process .

"By . Brian Mahoney . The San Antonio Spurs took a 3-1 lead in the NBA Finals with another comfortable 107-86 road win over Miami on Thursday, closing within one victory of avenging last year's loss to the Heat. Kawhi Leonard had 20 points and 14 rebounds for the Spurs, who can win their fifth NBA championship with a victory at home in Game 5 on Sunday. 'I'm pleased that they performed as well as they did while we've been in Miami, and that's about as far as it goes,' Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. 'Now we've got to go back home and play as well or better.' Moving closer: San Antonio Spurs forward Kawhi Leonard scores as his side win Game 4 . LeBron James tried to keep the Heat in it with 28 points and eight rebounds, but Dwyane Wade was just 1 of 10 through three quarters and finished with 10 points. If the Heat are going to win this series, it will take the biggest comeback in NBA Finals history. No team has overcome a 3-1 deficit in the finals, and the way they were outclassed twice on their home floor makes it hard to imagine the two-time champions being the first. 'This was probably the biggest surprise of the series,' Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. Tony Parker added 19 points, and Tim Duncan had 10 points and 11 rebounds for the Spurs, who shot 57 percent from the field. San Antonio lost twice in Miami to end last year's finals, their only defeat in the championship round. They won their two games in Florida this time by a combined 40 points. Can't bear to watch: LeBron James covers his face as the Heat bench their side go down to the Spurs . Extending their lead: Leonard goes for the basket as Miami's Chris Anderson and Ray Allen try and defend . The past 13 times Miami lost a playoff game, they always responded with a victory in the next encounter, but successive losses suggests they might be weary at the end of a fourth-straight season that has gone the distance. Miami seemed to lack the energy - or maybe effort - to defend San Antonio's precision ball movement for the full 24 seconds, and time after time the Spurs ended up with a shot from somebody who didn't have a defender nearby. The visitors were not quite as sharp as when they shot a finals-record 75.8 percent in the first half Tuesday, but they were still good enough to open another huge lead by half-time, and they withstood every attempt Miami made to make a run. Down and out: LeBron James and Miami are 3-1 down in the series . Blocked: San Antonio Spurs forward Tim Duncan stops the shot from Miami's Chris Bosh . 'We were expecting a reaction from them but we were ready for it, so we just did the same thing,' Spurs forward Boris Diaw said. The defense was definitely improved in the first half, holding Miami to 12 of 34 (35 percent). The Spurs used a 13-2 spurt to open a nine-point lead, and that was the margin when they went to the second ahead 26-17. San Antonio got the first five of the second to make it 31-17 on Danny Green's 3-pointer, and the Spurs blew it open later in the quarter with seven straight points, capped by Leonard's soaring follow dunk that made it 55-33. It was another rough start for James, who battled cramps in Game 1, then left the court and briefly returned to the locker room midway through the first quarter Thursday. He had 10 quick points in the third quarter to bring Miami within 13, but San Antonio got a basket from Duncan to start a 7-0 run that pushed it to 68-48. The Spurs poured it on late in the third, pushing the lead to 81-57.","Kawhi Leonard scores 20 points as Spurs win in Miami .

"By . Neil Ashton . Follow @@neilashton_ . Roy Hodgson is not a great lover of statistics. ‘I prefer the naked eye,’ he admitted ahead of England’s 2-1 defeat against Italy. It will not matter a jot to England’s head coach that Andrea Pirlo, the outstanding player on the field, had 117 touches of the ball and completed 100 passes in the Arena Amazonia. His team-mate Daniele de Rossi, stationed in his familiar central midfield role, had 114 touches. He was the second best player on the night. Intricate: Claudio Marchisio (left) Daniele De Rossi were key to Italy's passing game . Off the park: Juventus star Andrea Pirlo (right) made 41 more accurate passes than Steven Gerrard . The best teams in the world, Italy among . them, are trying to tell England something and yet this country . continues to ignore it at almost every level of the game. It is . heartbreaking. Instead we are told that the national team’s . philosophy is to play a hybrid of traditional English guts with some . glamour touches for a few key players. It isn’t working. Pick the bones out of England’s 2-1 defeat in the Arena Amazonia and this was yet another lesson in possession. Glen . Johnson, at right back, had more touches (82) than any other England . player. Steven Gerrard, with 78 on the night, was miles off the standard . set by the world’s best players in midfield. People were . crowing about England’s 93 per cent passing success rate in Manaus; what . they didn’t mention was that Gerrard (67) was the highest in the . England team. Pirlo (108 attempted passes) and De Rossi (105) were . operating at another level. Until this country is dragged kicking and . screaming into the modern era and the possession game, England will . never stand a chance of winning a major football tournament. It just isn’t possible. Second fiddle: Gerrard (right) had a pass accuracy of 92.5 per cent, but only completed 62 passes . Learning curve: Jordan Henderson (left) had a good game but couldn't match the Italian's ball possession . When Germany beat England on November 11 last year, Toni Kroos had 125 touches of the ball in our own backyard. In Bayern Munich’s Champions League tie at the Emirates, Kroos had 175 touches. It was a masterful performance. Watch . Germany on Monday night in their opening group game and two or three . players in midfield areas will have more than 100 touches each. England . rarely get anywhere near it. Spain mastered it at Euro 2008, the World Cup two years later and again at Euro 2012. When . they were beaten 5-1 by Holland in their opening group game in Brazil, . many celebrated the demise of Vicente del Bosque’s team. In the past . eight years Spain have won more trophies than England have in their . entire history and there is still much to learn from them. Those who . are stuck in the dark ages will argue that it’s all down to what you do . with the ball when the players are in possession.

"By . Mike Dickson In Paris . Follow @@Mike_Dickson_DM . Amelie Mauresmo has pledged that she will try to bring a female touch to Andy Murray’s coaching, while emphasising that her job is simply to help him win more Grand Slams. On the day Rafael Nadal retained his French Open title Murray sent shockwaves through the tennis world yesterday by appointing the 34 year-old former Wimbledon champion and world number one as his coach for the grass court season, and almost certainly beyond. 'I think he's maybe looking for something different, about emotions and sensitive things,' said Mauresmo, although she played down the symbolism of what is an unprecedented move for such a top male player. Bold step: Murray, who began training for the grass season today, has caused a stir by appointing Mauresmo . Proven class: Mauresmo was women's number won and won two grand slams, including Wimbledon . 'It's not really interesting for me, this part of the story, to be honest.  All I'm interested in is to be able to help him in his goals. He’s an amazingly talented tennis player and I feel I have plenty to offer him. 'It will change a little bit my life and my retirement, let's say.  I'm passionate about this sport. Miracles don’t happen overnight but I love challenges.' Mauresmo added that they had agreed to work for a ‘significant amount of weeks’ per year, assuming that the initial period is satisfactory. Murray explained the background to a move being seen as smashing a glass ceiling for female coaching: 'I spoke to her a few times on the phone and when I was in Paris I met her before the tournament,' he said. 'We chatted a little bit about it, whether she’d be up for doing it. There was a will from both sides to give it a go and see how it works out. Shared experience: Mauresmo won Wimbledon in 2006 while Murray finally took the title last year . Watching on: Mauresmo was at the French Open final on Sunday before starting work with Andy Murray . 'She’s obviously a fantastic player. She won Wimbledon, was World No. 1, won the Australian Open. Just from speaking to her, she’s very calm, she’ s a good person. I think we will communicate well together and I think that’s a very important part of coaching. ' I obviously worked with my Mum for a long time,  even periods when I was 16, 17 years old. For me it doesn’t feel like a very different thing. Obviously I wasn’t paying my Mum so it’ll be a little bit different this time around because I’ll be employing Amelie. I think it’s exciting, something a bit new for me, something a bit fresh and hopefully it works well.' Martina Navratilova was among those pleased to see Murray taking such a bold and agenda-setting step:, tweeting: 'An interesting call by Andy Murray. Cool to see a woman coaching a top guy. Hope it works out for them.' Mary Pierce, a French contemporary of Mauresmo who knows her well, told the BBC: 'She is a great person, she's got great values and a sense of hard work but she has a great sense of humour. 'She knows what it takes to win Grand Slams, what it takes to get to number one, she will take it very seriously and give her absolute best to help Andy.' Anguish: Murray had a strong French open before being thrashed by Rafael Nadal in the semi-final . Repeat success: Murray is desperate to replicate his win in SW19 last year after a promising French open . Two of the men who know Murray best from working with him, his ex-coaches Brad Gilbert and Mark Petchey, believe he has made an intelligent choice. 'I think this is good news for Murray, she should be a calming influence,'  said Gilbert. ' She was a smart player with an outstanding knowledge of the game who brings a fresh perspective and I think she will add a lot to Andy’s team.' Petchey added: 'I think it’s a sound move. Amelie is clearly someone Andy likes and respects and she will bring something different. There just wasn’t an ideal male coach out there, and so why not go with a woman who has plenty of knowledge.'","World No 8 has appointed two-time Grand Slam champion .

"By . Chris Foy In Dunedin . Failure. That was England’s abrupt summary of this result. There were no excuses or caveats, no attempts to sugar-coat another narrow loss. In their eyes, it amounted to failure. Again. Amid valid concerns about English decision-making under pressure on the field, there could be no questioning their clarity of thought in the aftermath of this second Test as they sifted through the wreckage of a series defeat. If the national team are to have genuine hope of winning the World Cup next year it is imperative that the inquest is harsh at times like this and the initial indications are that it certainly will be. As was the case in Auckland a week earlier there was no great pride after a fall, despite the late rearguard action which turned a procession into a photo-finish. Falling short: England front rowers David Wilson, Joe Marler and Rob Webber trudge after All Blacks loss . Over and out: Julian Savea scores a try to increase New Zealand's lead against England . Catch me if you can: Ben Smith scored a try for New Zealand against England . Two tries in the closing stages, after . the All Black storm had blown over, amounted to a distortion of the . true picture. Having roared ahead through Marland Yarde’s early try, . England ultimately  finished a distant second, despite the tight margin . on the scoreboard. Mike . Brown touched down during that late, face-saving fightback but he . avoided the temptation to paper over the cracks in the tourists’ performance. ‘We are not going to start applauding failure,’ said the . Harlequins full back. ‘We don’t applaud mediocrity. We are in a business . where winning counts. If we want to win a World Cup, we’ve got to beat . teams like New Zealand. It’s a tough second week in a row where we’ve . pushed the No 1 team in the world and been a fingertip away from turning . them over.’ Regrets . primarily related to the tendency for a fog to envelop English minds . when they needed 20-20 vision. Too often the wrong option was taken. While their opponents demonstrated supreme decision-making and clinical . precision at crucial moments, Stuart Lancaster’s men could not respond . in kind. Asked to identify . the ‘one per cent’ factors that continue to separate these teams, . England captain Chris Robshaw said: ‘They take their chances, it’s as . simple as that. There isn’t any secret recipe. We’re getting better and . better and it will click, but it takes time.’ There . was a sense on Saturday night of stereotypes being shattered as England . were left to curse their habit of being too gung-ho in possession. A . nation still largely pigeon-holed around the world for relying on a big . pack and a quality goal-kicker were berating themselves for an excess of . adventure and failing to retain composure. Promise: England made an encouraging start when Marland Yarde scored an early try . Lacking: England were unable to build on the good start and capitalise on the early try though . Match-winners: Julian Savea and Ben Smith celebrate their convincing victory against England . Make sure: Ma'a Nonu added a third try to put the All Blacks well in control of the game . Regroup: England learnt a lot about themselves during the rollercoaster ride against New Zealand . When . Brown was asked about  the shortcomings that must be  rectified in . Saturday’s final Test in  Hamilton, he said: ‘Taking different decisions . in different areas. We probably played around a bit too much in the . middle of the field. It is great we are showing the ambition but it’s . about understanding when it’s the right time, when it’s not.’ With . hindsight, England were left to rue the fact that when Billy . Twelvetrees tried to force an offload in the 43rd minute, it definitely . was not the right time to do so. In . the blink of an eye, a promising position for the tourists became a . telling strike at the other end as Aaron Cruden swept clear and sent . magnificent full back Ben Smith, an Otago local, away to score. Invariably, . the All Blacks made the right decision, even when operating in tight . spaces on the short side where their near-flawless  technique and . telepathy were there for all to see. The same could not be said for . England. Running man: Billy Twelvetrees of England skips past Ma'a Nonu during the first-half . In the book: Owen Farrell, centre, is shown the yellow card by referee Jaco Peyper . In the first half, . the visitors had spread mayhem in the Kiwi defence but with several men . forming an overlap on the right, Danny Care passed to an isolated . Robshaw on the left and the scoring chance was squandered. Just . before the break, England should have taken their lead to 17-3 but Manu . Tuilagi was unable to blast through Smith’s tackle after breaking clear . down the right and Brown couldn’t quite catch up in support to take an . inside pass. These are the . tiny margins separating the world’s leading Test team and their pursuers . who find themselves chasing Kiwi vapour trails. When . the All Blacks smelt  blood after half-time, they found attacking gears . that take them to heights beyond the reach of  England and every other . country — at least for now. Pace: Manu Tuilagi was moved onto the wing by Stuart Lancaster in a bold move . Formidable: New Zealand stand for their national anthem ahead of the game at the Forsyth Barr Stadium . Ma’a . Nonu was involved in the move that led to Julian Savea’s 50th-minute . try and the centre then assumed the role of finisher as midfield partner . Conrad Smith went into his familiar safe-cracking mode to open up . England’s defence. The home No 13 showcased the sort of nous and . awareness that England must add to their expanding repertoire in the . next 12 months. ‘Decision-making . is the final step we have to take,’ said Lancaster. Fair comment. His . team rallied with late tries by Brown and Chris Ashton but it didn’t . alter the impression of a global hierarchy being reasserted. Now England must somehow summon the will to snatch a consolation win five days from now. They are desperate to depart  with something to show for their  spirited efforts. ‘We’ve got another chance to  finish this tour with a bit of pride,’ said Brown. ‘By pushing a team like this on their home patch we showed how far we’ve come — but we’re judged on wins.’","England's Owen Farrell, Danny Care and Billy Twelvetrees returned to side .

"By . Chris Waugh . Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has warned Real Madrid that Ramires is 'not for sale' as Carlo Ancelotti continues his pursuit of the Brazilian midfielder. Ancelotti is keen to be reunited with a player he originally brought to Stamford Bridge in 2010 from Benfica but Mourinho is not willing to let his Madrid counterpart sign the 27-year-old. The Portuguese is in the process of rebuilding his Chelsea squad and he sees Ramires as an integral member of his side going forward - despite the £30million acquisition of Spain midfielder Cesc Fabregas. Hands off: Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has insisted midfielder Ramires (centre) is not for sale . Staying put: Mourinho is keen to keep the Brazlian at Stamford Bridge as he looks to rebuild his squad . Industrious: Ramires is a hard-working midfielder who has been an ever-present in Mourinho's side . Mourinho believes both players can help Chelsea progress and create a 'very complete midfield'. He told Marca: 'Ramires is staying at Chelsea. He's not for sale. 'I have an excellent friendship with important people within Real Madrid and they know that Ramires is going to stay at Chelsea. 'Cesc is a great player who adds a new . dimension to our side. He is different to Matic, Ramires and Oscar. We . will have a very complete midfield with him.' Dream team: Mourinho insists Ramires and £30m signing Cesc Fabregas can create a 'complete midfield' Keen: Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti, who signed Ramires for Chelsea in 2010, wants to bring him to Spain . The 51-year-old was also quick to distance himself from reports that he was interested in signing French defender Raphael Varane or German midfielder Sami Khedira from Los Blancos. 'They know that Ramires is not leaving, . but they also know that I'm not interested in any Real Madrid players,' he said. Ramires himself told Marca of his admiration for former boss Ancelotti, describing him as a 'very special coach'. However, Mourinho seems unwilling to allow his industrious midfielder to move to the Spanish capital and will do everything in his power to keep the Brazilian in west London. Ramires has played 196 times for Chelsea, scoring 26 goals.

"By . Andy Nicol . A win is a win, and Scotland will take it, but they were pretty lucky to emerge victorious from their  second game on the tour. Scotland didn’t play well and received a huge helping hand from the referee when he sent off a  Canadian player near the end. This was a huge call because  Canada had earned a penalty right in front of the posts, a certain three points, which would have taken them into the lead with only five minutes remaining. Flattered: Stuart Hogg kicks the winning penalty goal for Scotland late in the game against Canada . Seeing red: Scotlland were fortunate that the referee sent off Canada's Jebb Sinclair towards the end . The referee had spotted a  potential issue with how Canadian flanker Jebb Sinclair had carried the ball into, and through, Ruaridh Jackson and asked for the TMO to show the incident. The official  interpreted what he saw as leading with the elbow into the head and gave Sinclair a red card. It was a shocking decision because, quite frankly, it was not even a  penalty. If that is a red-card offence, we would see matches finishing seven against seven because it  happens all the time. I think the referee was influenced by his arm moving forward after the contact was made, and everything looks worse in slow motion. We will never know how Scotland would have reacted to going a point down with less than five minutes remaining, but the signs prior were not too promising. To be fair, each time Scotland  conceded points, they immediately went down the other end and scored themselves — so who knows? They might have got themselves out of jail. The win was just about the only positive to come out of the game. There were too many mistakes which just gave possession back to Canada, the set piece was not nearly as dominant as against the USA the week before and, at times, the defence was shocking. Let off! Scotland were guilty of making too many mistakes against Canada and should have been punished . Concern: Vern Cotter will be troubled by the number of times Scotland's backline was breached by Canada . On a number of occasions, the defensive line was breached which resulted in the Canada try and could have led to others. This is the aspect of the performance that will trouble Vern Cotter the most. On this tour, it was always going to be difficult to change things in attack, with the new coach coming in and not many sessions to work on any new patters. It does take time and repetition to embed a new attacking system or style of game and this is for next season. But the defensive system has not changed and defence coach Matt Taylor will be very  disappointed with the defensive performance. The line speed was not as good as it had been the week before and there were too many one-on-one tackles missed which allowed the line breaks. It wasn’t a system issue so the individual players will have to take responsibility, with the video session not making for pleasant watching.It was a lethargic performance all round by Scotland both in attack and defence. The intensity that needs to be there for every game was just not there. It does not take too much of a drop-off in each player to deliver a poor collective performance, and it might have been because it was the last game for many after a long, bruising season. Injury blow: Scotland flanker Alasdair Strokosch is stretchered off injured in Toronto, Canada . Individual handling errors meant that Scotland did not get to go through the phases and build  pressure on the Canadian defence at any time in the game. This is key when you play against a side like Canada. They have good shape for a few phases and like the big hits but begin to lose the shape when you get into multi-phase play. This tour was always going to be an exercise of evaluation for Vern Cotter to assess what he has to work with, but one thing to concern him will be the injuries that are mounting up. Already out for the autumn Tests are Matt Scott, Ryan Grant and Ryan Wilson with  long-term injuries, so he will be  hoping he gets better luck in the two remaining matches when it comes to the casualty list. It is good to analyse a  performance and be critical from a winning position. No one will be  kidding themselves about the  quality of the performance and the whole squad will know that they will really have to improve if they are to keep this winning tour going. The cavalry is on its way to Argentina, where a number of the Glasgow players will join the squad, which should help with confidence and improvement in performance.","Scotland defeated Canada 19-17 in Toronto .

"By . Aap . Australia has begun withdrawing its officials from strife-torn Iraq. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade says a number of embassy staff members have been pulled out of Baghdad due to the deteriorating security situation. 'The Australian embassy remains open with reduced staffing levels,' DFAT said in its latest travel advice. Locals in Baghdad have taken up arms as ISIL forces descend on the capital. Australian embassy officials have been evacuated as the crisis deepens . 'We are unlikely to be able to provide consular assistance in Iraq at the current time.' Islamic militants, spearheaded by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) jihadist group, have taken over a swathe of territory in northern Iraq in an offensive that has brought fighting to within 80km of the capital. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has said the Australian embassy can offer limited help to the 90-plus Australians still in Iraq . Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said an 'essential core' of embassy staff will remain in place but they will be limited in what they can do for the estimated 90-plus Australians in Iraq. 'Due to the very challenging security environment we are unlikely to be able to provide the level of consular assistance that might be expected,' she told ABC radio. The Iraqi government on Sunday said it had 'regained the initiative' against the militants, claiming to have killed 279 'terrorists' in the previous 24 hours. Ms Bishop described the situation as very volatile and said it could deteriorate further with little warning. 'But we certainly strongly support the Iraqi government's ongoing efforts to counter this terrorism that's taking place within its borders,' she said.

"By . Sarah Dean . The mother of a 13-year-old boy who was left in intensive care with a serious head injury after a collision on the football field on Saturday has called an urgent meeting with his club and the National Rugby League after he was allowed to keep playing once he'd suffered a head knock. Kellie Erwin said she had heard her son, Jarrod Fletcher, continued to play rugby league for Macarthur Saints after a head knock that left him 'concussed for one minute' and then later collapsed during the game at Campbelltown, in Sydney's south west, on Saturday. He was rushed by air ambulance to the Children's Hospital at Westmead after he collapsed. A spokesperson for Macarthur Saints has confirmed to MailOnline that the teen was 'never taken off the field at any stage'. 'What would have happened if he'd been tackled again?,' Ms Erwin said in an interview with MailOnline on Monday. 'In my eyes, why wasn't he taken off? He was still concussed for one minute.' Scroll down for video . Injured: Jarrod Fletcher suffered concussion during a rugby league game at Cambelltown Sydney on Saturday . The distraught mother explained that she had been given various explanations about what happened to her son while he played for the junior team Macarthur Saints. 'I wasn't present on the day of the accident... I've heard many different stories,' she said. Badly hurt: The teenage junior footballer, shown here in a photo from four years ago, was put into a medically induced coma . 'All I know is what people are telling me. Someone is telling me he got tackled and then he carried on playing and collapsed. 'I've been told stories there were two tackles and another said he had an elbow to his head. 'I've got to watch what I say because I wasn't there.' Dianne Morrison, an official at Macarthur Saints JRLFC who saw the incident happen, confirmed that Jarrod was 'never taken off the field at any stage'. 'He was assessed on the field and got up and continued to play,' she said. She admits that her teenage son might have acted like he was fine and put on a brave face after the head knock but she believes an adult should have stepped in. 'He might have said ""I'm OK, I'm OK""... but a parent or an adult should have taken him off,' she said. 'That's the only thing I'm a bit disgusted in,' she added. 'It's still my son's life.' Jarrod is still in intensive care at the Children's Hospital. A spokesperson told MailOnline on Monday that he was now in 'a satisfactory condition'. Describing the moment she reached her injured son on the field, she said: 'It was like a massive crime scene, police, ambulance.' She also praised the club for assisting her when she got there. 'The club did a wonderful job, they really assisted me and explained straight away... the ambulance put a sheet up and put him in an induced coma on the field.' No one had any reason to suspect Jarrod had suffered a serious injury when the head knock happened. His injury came just two days after 16-year-old Tyler Horton was forced to undergo brain surgery after being knocked unconscious when he was kneed in the head during a rugby league game at Bathurst. Ms Erwin spoke about Tyler and other teens, such as Curtis Lander, who had been seriously injured during league games. Brave face: Ms Erwin admits her son could have told officials he was 'ok' Emergency: Jarrod was airlifted to hospital after suffering a concussion during the rugby league match . 'Crime scene': Kellie Erwin described the moment she found her son in an induced coma on the pitch . 'I'm just the fortunate one,' she said. The concerned mother called on the NRL to force players to wear headgear during games. 'My son has never worn headgear. I do believe it should be enforced.' Curtis, who played for the Forster-Tuncurry Hawks on the NSW mid-north coast, was left paralysed by a horror tackle that fractured his c2 and c3 vertebrae. Club president Aaron Temple said he faced an uphill battled to recovery. 'He's looking at 12 months in hospital,' he told MailOnline. Ms Erwin said that as young men they might not want to wear headgear as it's all about their 'image' but 'as a parent we should enforce it'. Curtis Lander (left) was left paralysed by a horror tackle in May and 16-year-old Tyler Horton (right) was forced to undergo brain surgery after being knocked unconscious during a game this month . 'Over six years old, it should be compulsory,' she added. 'I believe it is time the NRL first graders wear head gear and lead an example. 'It may save your life.' Western Suburbs Junior Rugby League chief executive, Julie Luke, told MailOnline: 'Following Jarrod's injury on Saturday, we have received reports from the key parties involved on the day. It appears to us on the basis of those preliminary reports that all of the officials acted appropriately.' Ms Luke added: 'We'd like to correct two misconceptions. The incident was not as a result of any foul play; our own reports have confirmed it occurred as a result of an accidental collision. 'Jarrod was assessed and remained on the field after the collision. He did not leave the field of play. 'The sports trainer who treated Jarrod has a level one sports trainer accreditation as required at all junior rugby league matches and is appropriately qualified to assess such incidents.' NSWRL chief executive David Trodden added: 'WSJRL chief executive Julie Luke, chairman Wayne Hardy Smith and I have collectively reviewed reports into Jarrod's injury and the aftermath. We will continue to look into what happened on the day. 'We're continuing to monitor Jarrod's recovery, which is our focus, and have also offered Jarrod and his family our full support.

"By . Sarah Dean . Researchers have looked into what makes a long-term relationship work . Thinking your partner is better than you could be the key to a long-lasting relationship, researchers have claimed. A review of nine studies into long-term relationships has concluded that rose-coloured glasses are indeed 'good for relationships'. A paper by the Australian Institute of Family Studies suggests that focusing on the best parts of someone could be the way forward if you want to avoid a split in the long-term. 'Individual partners feel happier when their spouse or partner has a ""shinier"" view of them than they have of themselves,' the paper claims. It defines a long-term relationship as one that lasts between 11 to 56 years. The authors of the paper, Robyn Parker, Senior Manager, Research and Evaluation at Interrelate Family Centres, and Joanne Commerford, Research Officer at the Australian Institute of Family Studies, pointed to 2011 research by Claxton, O'Rourke, Smith and DeLongis. Their research found that wives were happier when there was a positive difference between their own ratings and their husbands' ratings of themselves on neuroticism, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. 'Partner similarity and viewing partners through rose-coloured glasses appear to underpin marital satisfaction, although in different ways for women and men,' the authors explained. The research paper looked at the key aspects relating to long-term relationships, including commitment, personality traits, transition to parenthood, health, and satisfaction and stability. Let's stay together: A paper by the Australian Institute of Family Studies suggests that focusing on the best parts of someone could be the way forward if you want to avoid a split . When it comes to commitment, the study found that simply wanting the relationship to continue is not enough. Couples must 'address difficult issues in the short term' for them to be beneficial in the long run. The study also noted that becoming a parent is a critical time for couples when predicting their satisfaction and stability going forward. The paper comes after figures from the Australian Institute of Family Studies last year showed a big increase in people divorcing after 20 years or more of marriage. AIFS' Director, Professor Alan Hayes said that the proportion of divorces ending after twenty years had increased from 13 per cent in 1990 to 28 per cent in 2011. 'Divorce trends have been heavily influenced by changing social norms about remaining in unhappy marriages. There is far less social stigma today about ending a marriage and women are less reliant on men for their financial stability,' Professor Hayes said.","Research looked at couples who'd been together between 11 and 56 years .

"By . Australian Associated Press . It's the genetically modified fruit from Australia that could turn East African nations into life-saving banana republics. Queensland University of Technology (QUT) researchers have engineered bananas grown in far north Queensland to increase the levels of beta-carotene, which is converted to vitamin A in the body. The researchers say their goal is to stop thousands of Ugandan children, and those from surrounding countries, from going blind and dying from Vitamin A deficiencies. With the researchers having now successfully bent the banana genome, the genetically modified fruit is being tested on humans for the first time. Life-saving banana republics: A research team from Australia's Queensland University of Technology have engineered bananas grown in far north Queensland to increase Vitamin A levels in the body . Thousands of children in Uganda and surrounding countries are deficient in the vitamin . About 10 kilograms of the orange-fleshed yellow fruit, grown near Innisfail, about 90 kilometres south of Cairns, has just been shipped to Iowa State University, where the trials are being conducted. Five Ugandan PhD students have been working with project leader Professor James Dale on the nine-year project, which received $10 million from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Life-saving: With vitamin A deficiencies leading to blindness and premature death for children under six years old in Uganda, the genetically engineered fruit could potentially be life-saving . According to Professor Dale, vitamin A-enriched banana varieties will be grown by Ugandan farmers by 2020. About 70 per cent of the Ugandan population survive on bananas. 'The Highland or East African cooking banana, which is chopped and steamed, is a staple food of many East African nations, but it has low levels of micronutrients, particularly pro-vitamin A and iron,' Professor Dale said. 'We're aiming to increase the level of pro-vitamin A to a minimum level of 20 micrograms per gram dry weight.' According to the World Health Organisation, Vitamin A deficiency is the leading cause of preventable blindness in children and is especially severe in Africa, where people are the poorest. Many children affected by Vitamin A deficiencies in Africa don't survive beyond six years old. Previous trials using Mongolian gerbils had already proved successful on the bananas. If the field trials in Uganda are a success, Professor Dale said the same technology could be transferred to countries such as Rwanda, and parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya and Tanzania.

"By . Sarah Dean . Patrick Mills has become the third Australian to win the NBA title after putting in an astounding performance for the San Antonio Spurs on Monday - but he could just as easily have become an AFL star, his former PE teacher has revealed. The 25-year-old also became the first ever indigenous player to take home the NBA grand prize, after his impressive appearance alongside Queensland team-mate Aron Baynes at the AT&T Center, San Antonia. Spurs scooped a 104-87 win over Miami Heat, helped in huge part by the 17 points Mills scored in his triumphant 18 minutes on the court.

Well done: San Antonio Spurs player Patty Mills of Australia hugs coach Gregg Popovich on stage after beating the Miami Heat in the NBA Finals . The 6ft player, who was born in Canberra, shot a barrage of three-pointers in a five minute stretch. And the Australian star blew past NBA American heavyweights on the court such as LeBron James. For anyone who watched Mills on the court, he might have seemed like a born basketball player. But his former PE teacher at Marist College in Canberra has told MailOnline the talented sportsman could have just as easily been an AFL star. Mark Winchester taught Mills in 2002, while he was in Year 8 at the school. 'You could see whatever he did he was brilliant at,' he said.

Celebrating: On the left, San Antonio Spurs forward Tim Duncan (right) hugs Spurs' guard Patty Mills after a play against the Miami Heat. On the right, Mills runs across the court after Spurs win the NBA title . Mills played rugby until Year 8 and then switched to AFL. It wasn't until the age of 15, that he started really focusing on basketball full-time when he was selected for the ACT U-18 squad to compete in the Australian National Championships. A year later, at the end of Year 10, he had to leave Marist College behind to attend the University of Canberra Senior Secondary College Lake Ginninderra, as it was much closer to The Australian Institute of Sport (AIS). Mills accepted a full-time scholarship with the AIS, which had previously developed Golden State Warriors player Andrew Bogut, when he was 16. Multi-talented: Mills was a great dancer, athlete, rugby and AFL star when he was a teenager at school in Canberra, his former PE teacher said . Cheers: San Antonio Spurs' Tony Parker of France (R) hoists the Larry O'Brien trophy and celebrates with teammates (L-R) Manu Ginobili of Argentina, Boris Diaw of France, Patty Mills of Australia and Marco Belinelli of Italy . 'He didn't really want to leave Marist... but he chose basketball, which is just as well for him,' Mr Winchester laughed on Monday. Personally, he had hoped Mills would carry on with AFL instead: 'I was Aussie rules trained so I was hoping he would continue.' 'There's no doubt he would have got drafted,' Mr Winchester said. Since leaving Marist College at the end of 2004, Mills has continued to return to his former school over the years - even now he is a world famous sportsman. He shoots: Mills takes a shot past Miami Heat forward Udonis Haslem at the AT&T Center in San Antonio . Mills entered the NBA Draft in 2009, when he was selected with the Portland Trail Blazers. On 29 August 2011, during the 2011 NBA lockout, Mills signed with the Melbourne Tigers in Australia for the 2011–12 NBL season. He then moved to China to play with the Xinjiang Flying Tigers. He eventually returned to the US in March 2012, when he was signed with the San Antonio Spurs - his current team. 'He's always very humble... every time he comes back to Canberra he visits us. 'We've got one of his Australia Basketball singlets in our Hall of Fame,' Mr Winchester said. Australian greats: Aron Baynes and Patty Mills of the San Antonio Spurs pose for a portrait with the Larry O'Brien Trophy after defeating the Miami Heat in Game Five of the 2014 NBA Finals . Where it all began: Mills excelled at sports while studying at Marist College in Canberra from 2001-2004 . 'He also used to come back and perform with our traditional dance group... he's a great dancer too,' he added. Mr Winchester described Mills as 'very friendly, extremely athletic and well motivated'. Mills' mother Yvonne was part of the Stolen Generation and his father Benny is a Torres Strait Islander. The 25-year-old is not the first talented sportstar in his family. His uncle Danny Morseau was the first indigenous basketball player for Australia at the Olympics in 1980. Morseau was in San Antonio for the NBA final on Monday and watched proudly as Mills became the first ever indigenous player to win the title.","The 25-year-old from Canberra helped San Antonio Spurs beat Miami Heat in the NBA finals on Monday .

"By . Paul Donnelley . Coca-Cola Life, a naturally sweetened drink with a third less sugar and calories than its regular cola which will be launched in September . Coca-Cola is to launch a naturally sweetened drink with a third less sugar and calories than its regular cola as part of government and industry-wide efforts to tackle obesity. Coca-Cola Life will go on sale in Britain in September following a pilot in Argentina and Chile, making it the first new Coca-Cola since Coke Zero was launched in 2006. It will also be sold in a green can. The new cola is sweetened with a blend of sugar and stevia leaf extract, and a 330ml can will contain 89 calories. A regular 330ml can of Coca-Cola contains 35 grams of sugar, or 39% of an adult’s GDA (guideline daily amount). Coca-Cola Life will contain 22.1 grams or 25% of an adult’s GDA. The two other Coca-Cola drinks, Coke Zero and Diet Coke, contain no calories. Stevia leaf extract is naturally sourced from the stevia plant, which is native to South America. Currently, Coca-Cola Great Britain uses stevia leaf extract as a sweetener in its Sprite and Glaceau vitamin water brands. Coca-Cola said that the new drink was part of its commitments to offer consumers reduced, low and no-calorie options – adding that it was the ‘most recent example in a series of initiatives by the company to inspire happier, healthier lives’. The company is a signatory to the Government’s Responsibility Deal, under which the food and drink industry has pledged to promote and healthier diet and make changes to their products, and Coca-Cola has committed to reduce the average calories per litre in its range of sparkling drinks by 5 per cent by the end of 2014. Other than introducing stevia extract to Sprite, it has launched smaller 250ml cans across the Coca-Cola range and recently announced a £20 million anti-obesity fitness drive in 70 parks in Britain. Early this year, a group of health experts launched a campaign to reduce the amount of sugar added to food and soft drinks as part of an effort to reverse the UK’s obesity and diabetes crisis. Action on Sugar said that the food industry would easily achieve a 20 to 30 per cent reduction in the amount of sugar added to products, which it said would result in a reduction of approximately 100 calories per day or more in those who are particularly prone to obesity. The real thing: a regular 330ml can of . Coca-Cola (left) contains 35 grams of sugar, or 39% of an adult’s GDA, whereas Coke Zero - or Bloke Coke - is calorie free . It said the reduction could reverse or halt the obesity epidemic and would also have a significant impact in reducing chronic disease. Coca-Cola Europe president James Quincey said: ‘We are pleased to add Coca-Cola Life to the Coca-Cola portfolio in the UK. ‘It complements our existing brands and is well-positioned to meet changing lifestyle trends, providing people with a great-tasting, lower calorie cola sweetened from natural sources. ‘With Coca-Cola Life, we have innovated to provide consumers with a new option with fewer calories. We were early signatories to the UK Government’s Responsibility Deal and as we work with others across society to address the public health challenge of obesity in the UK and across Europe, we will continue to take actions that help people balance their lifestyles.’ Coca-Cola Life will be available in a 330ml can, 500ml bottle and 1.75L bottle.","Coca-Cola Life will go on sale in September after pilot in Argentina and Chile .

"By . Sean Poulter . Upmarket soft drinks may seem like healthy alternatives to big names like Coca-Cola but they contain far more sugar, researchers warn today. Ginger beer, prestige lemonade, dandelion and burdock, and sparkling elderflower are some of the options now on the shelves. But they can come with as much as 13 teaspoons of sugar in a bottle. Fizz: How the sugar content of a variety of soft drinks compares . Big brand and cheaper supermarket versions of Coca-Cola and Pepsi weigh in at around nine teaspoons. That compares to six or more teaspoons typically found in eight out of ten other high street fizzy drinks. Health campaigners who compiled the figures warn that adults and  children are consuming huge quantities of hidden sugar in processed food and drink, which is fuelling obesity and poor health. The World Health Organisation recommends a drastic cut to a maximum of about 25g a day, which equates to six teaspoons. But Action on Sugar analysed 232 popular drinks and found that 79 per cent contained this amount of sugar in a single 330ml serving. Restrained: Big brand colas such as Pepsi have significantly;y less sugar than many alternatives . The group is urging Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to put pressure on manufacturers and supermarkets to make their drinks less sweet by cutting sugar levels. Chairman Professor Graham MacGregor said: ‘Added sugars are completely unnecessary in our diets and are strongly linked to obesity and type 2 diabetes.’ Prof MacGregor, of the Wolfson Institute, London, also warned that sugar was adding to the major problem of dental decay. He said: ‘Replacing sugar with sweeteners is not the answer, we need to reduce overall sweetness so people’s tastes can adjust to having less sweet drinks.’ A similar approach has led to a 15 per cent drop in salt intake over ten years, saving 9,000 lives a year plus reducing annual health spending by £1.5billion, added the professor. He said: ‘It is time to do the same for sugar.’ The research found that sugar levels in apparently similar products showed wide variations, suggesting the amount could be cut.Kawther Hashem, nutritionist at Action on Sugar, advised: ‘Look on the label for “sugar per 100g” and switch to a lower or no added sugar variety, or even better, don’t drink them, they contain nothing of any nutritional value.’ The British Soft Drinks Association claimed the campaigners were ‘blinded by political zeal’. Director general Gavin Partington said manufacturers ‘have led the way in providing an increasing range of low and no-calorie drinks’. Dr Glenys Jones, nutritionist at Sugar Nutrition UK, a body financed by manufacturers, said: ‘Like all sources of calories, sugars and sugar-containing food and drinks can be consumed within a healthy, balanced diet and active lifestyle.’","Upmarket drinks crammed with as much as 13 teaspoons of sugar each .

"By . Jennie Agg . Sarah Peet, 27, had her bladder removed after a late cancer diagnosis . For . most brides-to-be, the big decisions are where to get married and what . sort of dress to have. But less than two months after Sarah Peet's . boyfriend, Simon, asked her to marry him, she was discussing treatments . for the aggressive cancer that had been detected in her bladder. Sarah, . a 27-year-old primary school teacher, had been back and forth to her GP . with painful cystitis since 2010, and every time she'd been told it was . an infection. But in November last year, she found out the cause was in . fact a tumour, and it was so advanced she would need to have her . bladder removed. 'When I first went to my doctor I just thought I had . a urine infection,' says Sarah, who lives in Alfreton, Derbyshire, with . Simon and their two dogs. 'I had a burning sensation when I went to the . toilet and a bit of pain. I was given antibiotics and that worked. 'But . the symptoms kept coming back. I went to my GP a few times, and would . be given antibiotics, which seemed to shift it. Sometimes I'd try and . deal with it myself by drinking lots of water and cranberry juice.' Then, . last August, Sarah was alarmed to see a lot of blood in her urine. 'I'd . never had that before, and it was completely bright red,' she says. 'Even then, the GP took my sample and said ""oh dear, you've got a terrible UTI"".' A . UTI - a urinary tract infection - is a general term used for an . infection of the organs that make or get rid of urine, such as the . bladder, the kidneys and urethra, the tube that carries urine out of the . body. Common symptoms include pain when urinating, needing to go more . often, urine that is cloudy or strong-smelling and sometimes blood in . the urine. Half of all women will have at least one UTI in their . lifetime, compared with about 12 per cent of men. 'Men have a longer . urethra, so bacteria is less likely to reach the bladder,' explains . James Catto, professor of urological surgery at the University of . Sheffield. 'Whereas infections are quite common in women, who have a . short urethra.' While a urinary tract infection is the most likely . explanation for blood in the urine and needing to urinate more . frequently, these can also be signs of bladder cancer, which otherwise . has few symptoms. And this overlap is a major reason why women with . bladder cancer are less likely to get a timely diagnosis, according to . researchers from Cambridge University. In an analysis of national . cancer statistics last year, they found women with the disease - the . UK's seventh most common cancer - were nearly three times as likely as . men to have made three or more visits to their GP before being referred . for investigation. 'When I first went to my doctor I just thought I had a urine infection,' says Sarah . 'The problem is bladder cancer is not at the . forefront of a GP's mind for women, because it's still more common in . men and the symptoms of bladder cancer mimic urinary tract infections, . which are more likely in women,' says Professor Catto. Sarah went . back to her GP a week after first seeing the blood, and by then, she . also had excruciating pain in her lower back and on the left side of her . abdomen. 'A different doctor prodded my back, which made me scream. So . he said I should be sent for an ultrasound as I probably had kidney . stones.' It was this ultrasound that detected the tumour. She . underwent a cystoscopy, where a camera is inserted into the bladder on a . fine tube, which confirmed the diagnosis, and had surgery to remove the . tumour last November. All the while, doctors assured her that it was . likely to be a non-aggressive cancer. As Professor Catto explains, . there are two main types of bladder cancer. 'The majority are . non-invasive, and limited to the lining of the bladder. This type is not . life-threatening and we treat that by scraping it away, then directing . chemotherapy into the bladder itself, usually as a one-off treatment. The proportion of GP consultations that are for urinary tract infections . 'Around . a third of bladder cancer cases will be aggressive, having spread to . the muscle and sometimes the fat around the bladder. This type will . require complete bladder removal - known as a cystectomy - or . radiotherapy.' In Sarah's case, the biopsy results a week later . revealed that the cancer was aggressive, and it had invaded the muscle . and fat around the bladder. She needed chemotherapy as soon as possible - . and to have her bladder removed. 'I felt numb. Like it couldn't really be happening,' Sarah recalls. 'In . a few months, I'd gone from being an apparently healthy person, to . being in and out of hospital for three cycles of chemotherapy, planning . surgery to take out my bladder. 'I had to give up work temporarily . because chemo weakens the immune system, and I couldn't be around my . pupils in case I caught anything from them - I teach Year 6 and missed . them terribly. 'It's a heck of lot to come to terms with,' says . Sarah. 'Simon has been brilliant, though, he's been very practical and . positive. When I've had a bit of a wobble, he'll say ""OK, have a cry, . but in five minutes we're going to talk about how you're going to get . through this"".' Although bladder cancer is more common in men, . particularly older men - the average age of diagnosis is 68 - women, who . account for around a third of cases, have poorer survival rates. Just . 50 per cent of women with bladder cancer are still alive after five . years, compared with 58 per cent of men with the disease, according to . Cancer Research UK. She had to give up work temporarily because chemo weakens the immune system . Late diagnosis is a major factor. 'A man with . blood in his urine is more likely to be referred to specialist, as UTIs . are rarer in men, and blood in the urine can be a symptom of an enlarged . prostate,' explains Professor Catto. Another problem is that blood in . the urine may be hard to spot at first. It can be quite subtle - only . slightly streaked with red, or even brown-looking. The blood comes . from the tumour or surrounding tissue. 'This blood can come and go as a . tumour will bleed intermittently,' says Dr Jon Rees, a GP in North . Somerset who also works as a urologist. 'So it may seem antibiotics for a . suspected urine infection have solved it.' Bladder cancer can mimic . symptoms of a urinary tract infection such as needing to urinate more . frequently, a burning sensation or feeling the need to go, but it can . also cause a UTI. 'A tumour can affect your bladder's ability to . empty - and this will predispose you to bacterial infection because . bacteria aren't expelled from the urinary tract as efficiently,' says . Professor Catto. 'So, with bladder cancer you may have a bacterial . infection as well, which will respond to antibiotics.' Dr Rees points . out that 'for the majority of patients, blood in the urine will have a . much more innocent cause'. However, he says you should always see a . doctor about it; and repeat UTIs, especially in conjunction with another . new symptom such as urgently needing the loo or lower back pain, should . be investigated. The main cause of bladder cancer is exposure to . chemicals and toxins, which are stored in the bladder. The biggest . culprits are cigarette smoke and chemicals used in heavy industry. 'There . is an attitude that if you're not male, you're not a smoker or not over . 70, it's probably not bladder cancer,' says Andrew Winterbottom, . founder of the charity Fight Bladder Cancer. 'But it can happen to . anybody.' Sarah knows this only too well. 'No one can really . understand why I got it - I was young, fit, a non-smoker - and female,' she says. In April, Sarah had her bladder removed. Although she was . offered surgery to form a new bladder using part of the bowel, she's . opted instead for an external bag. 'I just couldn't face more surgery, . and I was told the reconstruction surgery can have to be repeated,' she . says. 'I wanted to get on with my life.' Because surgery for advanced . bladder cancer removes the nearby lymph nodes, urethra, womb and . cervix, Sarah will not be able to have children. But she refuses to feel . sorry for herself. 'How could I? This surgery has saved my life,' she . says. Once she's recovered from surgery, Sarah will have more chemo. For now, she is determined to get on with planning her wedding in . April. 'I had to put off wedding dress shopping, but I plan to go this . summer. I can't wait.' www.fightbladdercancer.co.uk .","Sarah, 27, from Alfreton, had been to her GP with painful cystitis since 2010 .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Teenagers in hoodies are stereotypically portrayed as uncommunicative. But this could be about to change after a team of graduate students created a hooded sweatshirt that lets the wearer send subtle and covert messages. Different pre-programmed texts can be sent using a number of gestures, so wearers can tell a friend they're free to chat or they're missing them, merely by touching their sleeve. Scroll down for video . Sending messages on the sly: Graduate students have created a hooded sweatshirt with built-in technology that allows the wearer to keep in touch by subtly sending a text. By touching the sides of her hood, designer Alina Balean (pictured) can send a text to her mother . The prototype hoodie is designed to respond to three gestures in order to send pre-programmed messages. The smart sweatshirt was created by students at New York University’s Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP). The prototype hoodie has a GSM radio and sensors sewn inside it, allowing the piece of clothing to respond to different gestures, The Verge reported. In a demonstration video, the wearer touches the hood and rolls up a sleeve to send messages to a pre-programmed contact. Rucha Patwardhan and Alina Balean learned how to build a simple mobile phone using an Arduino board - a microcontroller. It also features an Arduino GSM shield, which connects the Arduino to the internet using the GPRS wireless network. They said they wanted to put ‘the technology behind a cell phone into something truly wearable and every day,’ and so created the ‘smart hoodie’. Smart inside: The prototype hoodie has a GSM radio and sensors sewn inside it (pictured), allowing the piece of clothing to respond to different gestures . A textile designer in Budapest has taken the first steps to creating clothing that can change colour like a chameleon. Judit Eszter Karpati's experimental fabric can change colour in seconds using a number of electronic devices. She created the interactive fabric using computer programming, engineering and electronic devices. The fabric consists of an ‘arduino with 12V power supply and 20 custom PCBs [printed circuit boards] driving and controlling four industrial 24V DC power supplies.' These heat two handmade woven pockets fitted with nichrome wires, and screen-printed with thermochromatic dying, which reveal the pre-programmed patterns. Two slow moving textile ‘displays’ show the content. They react to environmental changes such as heat and pressure by changing colour and pattern. Karpati's work could be one of the first steps in creating clothes and military uniforms that enable wearers to blend into changing backgrounds. Balean wrote in a blog post that the first switch was concealed in the left sleeve of the hoodie so she could secretly send messages to her Facebook account. ‘After that we tested switches with the hoodie and other sleeve. Gestures that used to require your fingers on a tiny piece of glass now are translated into everyday movement; buttons no more,’ she said. The duo then programmed the hoodie to send set text messages to Balean’s mother, notifying her of her daughter’s activities at university. ‘If I rolled up my left sleeve it tells her I am in class and can’t talk, if I put my hoodie on it tells her that I miss her, and if I push the right sleeve it lets her know I am free and can chat online,’ she said. The graduates believe their innovation could be the first step in producing a hoodie that can be used as a safety device, so that someone walking along in a bad area at night, for example, could subtly send a message about their whereabouts without attracting any unwanted attention. ‘Iterations of this hoodie can be a safety device for individuals traveling alone, children or others that need to communicate discreetly,’ Balean said. Currently, the wearers of the hoodie need a certain amount of tech know-how to pre-programme messages, but in the future there could be an easy web interface to let users write messages and numbers so they could easily communicate using the clothing. In a demonstration video, Balean touches the hood and sleeves of the garment, and rolls up a sleeve to send messages to her mother. For example, rolling up the sleeve sends a message (pictured) informing her mother she is in class and unable to talk .

"By . Bianca London . With Father's Day just around the corner, the likes of Richard Branson, Chelsea Clinton and Ziauddin Yousafzai have made touching films about how fathers can empower their daughters. The videos are in aid of G(irls)20 - a global initiative to celebrate the powerful force fathers can play in the advancement of their daughters. The campaign calls on fathers from around the world to showcase the ways in which they empower their daughters to succeed and achieve - whatever age, whatever dream - and also encourages daughters to share stories about how their fathers have empowered them. Daddy dearest: The likes of Richard and daughter Holly Branson have made short films about the relationship between father and daughter to celebrate the powerful force fathers can play in the advancement of their daughters . The initiative, which is being supported by hotel group Carlson Rezidor, is being launched in the run-up to the world leaders' meeting at the G20 in Australia this August. There, G(irls)20 will convene 24 girls from around the world to address how to economically engage and empower girls and women to achieve growth goals globally and in their home countries. On how fathers empower their daughters, Virgin boss Richard Branson, father to 32-year-old Holly Branson, said: 'Give them the freedom to do what they want to do with their life. It is so sad that in some places in the world, daughters are treated as second-class citizens and that’s got to be put right. 'People cannot use religion as an excuse, which is certainly not what the people who originally set out their religions would have wanted, so just treat all your children equally.' Close: Sir Richard Branson tenderly places his arm around Holly as they explain how important it is for fathers to let daughters make their own life decisions . Holly adds: 'I completely agree. If every father can . empower their daughter to do exactly what they want and what their . passion is, that's exactly what I did. It meant that I had the drive to . get my GCSEs, the right A-levels and make it to become a doctor.' Chelsea Clinton, the only child of former U.S. President Bill Clinton and former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, said: 'It is impossible for me to describe the extent to which my father has supported me, nurtured me and empowered me over the years. 'He has always taught me . the importance of doing right - by our family, by the communities I've . chosen to be apart of and ultimately by the world. 'Ultimately, trying . to do what's good, engaging in a life of service, is ultimately what's . going to give my life the most fulfillment and ensure that I'm living up . to be the daughter that he always wanted and the daughter that I always . wanted to be for him and also for myself. 'He's always taught me the . importance of family. He made every effort to be home for dinner every . night, unless he was on another continent. He's always challenged me to . take risks, the ones that are necessary for the person that I want to . be.' Support: Chelsea Clinton also stars in the short film and discusses how her father has supported her in every decision she has made and set good examples for her . Nurturing: Chelsea Clinton, the only child of former U.S. President Bill Clinton and former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, said it's impossible to explain how much her father has empowered her . Family: Chelsea, pictured with her parents in 1992, says that Bill always made sure he was home for dinner . Chelsea, 34, goes on to explain that whether it was taking an extra . hard maths class and ensuring that he was there to help her navigate her . homework or in deciding that she would marry partner Mark and join the Clinton . foundation, Bill supported her decisions, small and large. She added: 'I am grateful to my father most of all for always being . ready with a hug, a word of advice but most of all with an example as . Mark and I think about starting our own family. So, happy father's day, dad, . and to fathers everywhere.'

Sacrifices: Talansky says 'it's moments like this that makes you forget all (the sacrifices)' 'It was a very hard start and we had Ryder Hesjedal on the front and I rode up to him. He sacrificed himself for me all day. We didn't know if it would work but it was the perfect opportunity and we had to try.' Talansky was fourth on the day, seven seconds behind stage winner Mikel Nieve on the 131.5-kilometer (81.7-mile) trek from Megeve to Courchevel. Contador was 27 seconds behind in the overall standings, with Jurgen Van den Broeck eight seconds further back in third. Talansky had started the day in third place, 39 seconds behind Contador, who had an eight-second lead over defending champion Chris Froome. Froome crossed the line more than five minutes behind Nieve, to finish the race 12th overall. The Dauphine is regarded as the warm-up for the Tour de France, but Talansky - who finished 10th in the Tour last year - was quick to deny he is now a favorite for the prestigious race. Neither Chris Froome (right) or Contador (second from right) could stop Talansky from racing to victory . In the lead: Talansky (right) was able to hold off the likes of Contador to win the race . 'I still wouldn't say that,' he said. 'This is the Dauphine, the Tour is a different race, but I hope to have a great ride.'

Scroll down for video . Cinema goers in Hong Kong were initially shown a calming advert of someone driving through a forest as part of the shocking safety ad . As the ad progressed, a mass text message programme was used to simultaneously send a text to audience members . The movie theater was equipped with a location-based broadcaster that could send a mass text to everyone in the room at once. A special short film aired before the feature showing the ad. At the right time, operators sent the text so that everyone's phone went off. As they look down, the crash happens, taking them by surprise. All the while, film cameras capture their reaction. The ad, which was shown as a trailer to a feature film at the MCL Cinema in Hong Kong, shows a point-of-view account of a person getting into their car and setting off on a drive. The movie theater was equipped with a location-based broadcaster that could send a mass text to everyone in the room at once. At the same time, a special short film aired before the feature showing the ad. The stunt has already become a huge hit on YouTube, with almost 190,000 views. It was created by Ogilvy Beijing. The ad comes after engineers at Volkswagen revealed what they claim is the world’s most fuel efficient production car, which can do a staggering 313 miles per gallon. The Volkswagen XL1 ‘super efficient vehicle’ features new construction techniques, an innovative futuristic-looking body and hybrid drive-train to dramatically increase fuel economy. The edgy design is intended to reduce drag and it features ‘scissor doors’  which were famously featured in the DeLorean DMC-12, used in the Back to the Future films. Once the text was sent, cinema goers could not help themselves from checking their messages at the same time . As they checked, the car suddenly careered off the mountain track, resulting in a huge crash which left patrons stunned and shocked. To achieve the target fuel consumption figure the XL1 was aerodynamically optimised, adopting a classic ‘tear drop’ shape and using innovations such as removing traditional wing mirrors and replacing them with small cameras called e-Mirrors, which transmit exterior images to interior displays. Volkswagen’s car measures almost four metres long and 1.7metres wide, making it similar in size to the VW Polo, yet it is just 1.2metres tall, making it a similar height to a Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder. It is powered by a compact 800 cc two-cylinder diesel engine and together with the 20kW electric motor, it car can travel over 600 miles on a single tank of fuel. Engineers at Volkswagen have made what they claim is the world's most fuel efficient production car, which can do a staggering 313 miles per gallon . The two-seat diesel-electric hybrid car emits 24 g/km of carbon dioxide, which the German auto manufacturer says sets a new benchmark for vehicle efficiency. The car's fuel efficiency of 313 miles per gallon compares favourably with Toyota's Prius, which typically does 44mpg in city driving conditions and Ford's Fiesta, which does 31mpg on average. In theory, it could be driven from the centre of London to the outskirts of Edinburgh in a straight line, using just one gallon of fuel. The XL1 was designed from scratch and is lightweight as some steel components, including the chassis, have been replaced by carbon fibre so that the car weighs in at just 795kg.

"By . Mark Prigg . The FBI has begun using a facial-recognition surveillance system that will store millions of mug shots - and could even use driving licence pictures. FBI Director James Comey told lawmakers 'We’re piloting the use of mug shots, along with our fingerprint database, to see if we can find bad guys by matching pictures with mug shots. Earlier this year the Electronic Frontier Foundation revealed the system is capable of processing 55,000 faces a day - and that it will have 52 million faces by 2015. The database, shared with other federal agencies and with the approximately 18,000 tribal, state and local law enforcement agencies across the United States, already has 7-8 million individuals loaded. The Next Generation Identification (NGI) system builds on the FBI’s legacy fingerprint database, which already contains well over 100 million individual records, and has been designed to include multiple forms of biometric data, including palm prints and iris scans in addition to fingerprints and face recognition data. NGI combines all these forms of data in each individual’s file, linking them to personal and biographic data like name, home address, ID number, immigration status, age, race, etc. This immense database is shared with other federal agencies and with the approximately 18,000 tribal, state and local law enforcement agencies across the United States. However, Comey admitted he was not sure where the pictures were coming from, amid claims driving license pictures as well as police mug shots would be used. 'I don’t think so. The Next Gen Identification, as I understand it, is about mug shots,' Comey said, according to Arstechnica. 'I think there is some circumstances in which when states send us records, they’ll send us pictures of people who are getting special driving licenses to transport children or explosive materials or something—but as I understand it, those are not part of the searchable Next Generation Identification database.' The database, shared with other federal agencies and with the approximately 18,000 tribal, state and local law enforcement agencies across the United States, already has 7-8 million individuals. Earlier this year the Electronic Frontier Foundation, under the Freedom of Information Act, obtained records from the bureau showing as many as 52 million images by next year, and that it will include pictures of innocent people. In response to a question from Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-CA), the director said he wasn't sure of the accuracy of the EFF's claims. 'I saw some of the same media, and that's what led me to ask my folks: so what’s the deal with this?' Comey said. 'And the explanation to me was the pilot is mug shots. 'Because those are repeatable, we can count on the quality of them. 'And they’re tied to criminal conduct, clearly. And so there was not a plan and there is not at present where we are going to add other non-mug shot photos. But again, if I’ve got that wrong I'll fix it with you.' The FBI is piloting the program with a company called MorphoTrust. Lofgren said MorphoTrust has also produced a State Department facial recognition database holding some 244 million images. 'Will your Next Generation Identification system be capable of importing the State Department records or searching the State Department records?' she asked - to which Comey said he was unsure. Currently, if you apply for any type of job that requires fingerprinting or a background check, your prints are sent to and stored by the FBI in its civil print database. However, the FBI has never before collected a photograph along with those prints - but this is changing with NGI. Now an employer could require you to provide a 'mug shot' photo along with your fingerprints. If that’s the case, then the FBI will store both your face print and your fingerprints along with your biographic data. 'The records we received show that the face recognition component of NGI may include as many as 52 million face images by 2015,' the EFF's Jennifer Lynch said. The latest documents also reveal that non-criminal photos will be included. 'One of our biggest concerns about NGI has been the fact that it will include non-criminal as well as criminal face images,' the EFF said. 'We now know that FBI projects that by 2015, the database will include 4.3 million images taken for non-criminal purposes. The EFF received the records in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit for information on Next Generation Identification (NGI). The system builds on the FBI’s legacy fingerprint database, which already contains well over 100 million individual records, and has been designed to include multiple forms of biometric data, including palm prints and iris scans in addition to fingerprints and face recognition data.

The system builds on the FBI¿s legacy fingerprint database, which already contains well over 100 million individual records, and has been designed to include multiple forms of biometric data, including palm prints and iris scans in addition to fingerprints and face recognition data. By 2012, NGI already contained 13.6 million images representing between 7 and 8 million individuals, and by the middle of 2013, the size of the database increased to 16 million images. The new records reveal that the database will be capable of processing 55,000 direct photo enrollments daily and of conducting tens of thousands of searches every day. The new system also link criminal and non-criminal fingerprint databases. Every record—whether criminal or non—will have a “Universal Control Number” (UCN), and every search will be run against all records in the database. 'This means that even if you have never been arrested for a crime, if your employer requires you to submit a photo as part of your background check, your face image could be searched—and you could be implicated as a criminal suspect—just by virtue of having that image in the non-criminal file, sayd the EFF. The states taking part in the project . It says the new system raises major privacy concerns. 'NGI will allow law enforcement at all levels to search non-criminal and criminal face records at the same time. 'This means you could become a suspect in a criminal case merely because you applied for a job that required you to submit a photo with your background check. 'Second, the FBI and Congress have thus far failed to enact meaningful restrictions on what types of data can be submitted to the system, who can access the data, and how the data can be used. 'This is not how our system of justice was designed and should not be a system that Americans tacitly consent to move towards.'","Campaigners say database poses 'real threats to privacy' for Americans .

Equally miserable is playmaker Andrea Pirlo who was forced to seek solace with the Italy squad priest, Don Massimiliano Gabricci, after being dumped by his wife Deborah Roversi, following an alleged liaison with blonde Valentina Baldini, who he met at his golf club. By contrast, the England camp is a relative oasis of marital harmony with one member of the team, Frank Lampard, set to marry his long term love Christine Bleakley as soon as the World Cup ends. Equally happy are the Rooneys, who recently celebrated their sixth wedding anniversary, and the Gerrards. But while many of the Italian WAGS will be spotted in the stands, none of the England team is thought to have brought their partners to Brazil, although Coleen Rooney is on her way. Steven Gerrard’s wife Alex is currently on holiday in Ibiza, although may travel out to Brazil should England make it through the group stages.

According to Starbucks, over the next three years, more than 100,000 table chargers will be installed in Starbucks' 7,500 company-owned stores in the U.S. (pictured) ‘Powermat Spots in Starbucks are the result of almost a decade of scientific research spanning material sciences, magnetic induction and mesh networking,’ said Ran Poliakine, chief executive of Powermat Technologies. ‘The two-pronged power-plug dates back to the era of the horse drawn carriage, so that today’s announcement marks the first meaningful upgrade to the way we access power in well over a century.’ The typical customer will probably use the wireless re-charger for about 15 minutes, Starbucks predicts. The group is also planning to pilot a programme later this year that will let customers order ahead via mobile apps. It could mean the end of the daily hunt for power cables. Korean researchers have unveiled an experimental wireless recharging system that could top up the mobile of everyone in the office wirelessly. The system can transmit power up to 16 ft (five metres), and charge up to 40 phones at a time. It is even powerful enough to power a TV. Called the 'Dipole Coil Resonant System', it is believed to be the longest range wireless power system developed so far. 'The way electronic devices receive their power has changed tremendously over the past few decades, from wired to non-wired,' the researchers say. 'Users today enjoy all kinds of wireless electronic gadgets including cell phones, mobile displays, tablet PCs, and even batteries. Chun T. Rim, a professor of Nuclear & Quantum Engineering at KAIST in Korea, said the system could also power larger items. 'With DCRS a large LED TV as well as three 40 W-fans can be powered from a 5-meter distance.' The distance is a record for wireless technology. Current phone systems, for example, require the user to place their phone on a charging 'pad - such as the one being introduced to Starbuck stores.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . On Facebook, are you a grumpy know-it-all who disagrees with people, or an extrovert who lets everyone know what you’re up to? If you’re not sure, don’t fret - a web tool now lets you see just what your status updates reveal about your personality. The intuitive site analyses words from your posts to show you what sort of person you are, and then compares your traits with friends and celebrities. San Francisco company Five has revealed a tool for Facebook that analyses your personality based on the words you have used in status updates. It gives scores in five areas: Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Neuroticism and Openness, and then compares this to your friends and celebrities . The tool is called Five Labs and predicts users’ personalities based on their Facebook posts. A group of university professors recently unveiled a scanner they believe can detect the perfect job for anyone - simply by looking at their fingerprints. While the science remains in contention, the group claim that in the future, fingerprints could help reveal key personality traits. The new biometric test was used at a careers convention in Krasnodar, a city in southwestern Russia. To use the scanner, people place their fingers upon the fingerprint reader and computer technology linked up to sensors reads back what sort of work would suit the individual. It was built as a demonstration of how today’s public social networks can analyse user content, according to the company. Five Labs, based in San Francisco, examines the linguistic content of Facebook wall posts, pulling key words to make assumptions about individual personalities. Users can compare these traits to their friends', as well as public figures such as President Barack Obama and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The tool uses an artificial intelligence method designed by Dr Hansen Andrew Schwartz, a lead researcher at the University of Pennsylvania’s Worldwide Well-Being Project, and an advisor to Five. The application’s predictions are based around the Big Five personality traits: the leading personality theory in modern psychology. According to the theory, personality is based on five characteristics - extraversion, openness, neuroticism, conscientiousness, and agreeableness. Using the web tool you can see what personality traits you have. In this image it can be seen that President Barack Obama is quite extraverted, but not too compassionate or cooperative. He is, however, very organised and has a great degree of intellectual curiosity, according to Five Labs . Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, meanwhile, has quite a different personality to the so-called most powerful man in the world. Zuckerberg is much more willing to cooperate than Obama but prefers to keep himself to himself. He is very open to new ideas but also experiences unpleasant emotions like anger more frequently . Five’s co-founder Nikita Bier said that the application is meant to hold a mirror to the growing trend of social applications mining data from user content. In a bid to capitalise off of its immense stores of social data, Facebook recently founded a research laboratory in New York City. Similarly, Google has acquired an artificial intelligence company DeepMind this past January. The goal of Facebook’s lab is apparently to extract as much physchological meaning as it can from user content, said Five. But while Five Labs employs similar techniques, it does not store the information, discarding information once it has been viewed. ‘Think of this as a personality snapshot,’ says Bier. ‘It’s all for fun, but we’re also hoping to educate. ‘People need to ask themselves a profound question: “how does my data portray me on public networks - and how might that be used?”’","San Francisco company Five has revealed a tool to analyse Facebook .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . At a time when mankind's encroachment on habitats is increasingly leading species to extinction, scientists have discovered a mass migration of animals in Africa that reaches farther than any other documented on the continent. The journey made by about 2,000 zebra who travelled between Namibia and Botswana, two countries in a sparsely populated part of southern Africa, was discovered by wildlife experts only after some of the zebras were collared with tracking devices. The newfound migration is a rare bright spot at a time when mass movements of wildlife are disappearing because of fencing, land occupation and other human pressures. Species of plants and animals around the planet are being wiped out at least 1,000 times faster than they did before humans arrived on the scene, said a separate study published Thursday by the journal Science. Scientists have discovered a mass migration of zebras in Africa that reaches farther than any other documented on the continent . The previously unheralded trek occurs within the Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area, which is the size of Sweden and encompasses national parks in Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Zambia and Angola. 'It goes to show us that nature still has some surprises,' said Robin Naidoo, senior conservation scientist at the Washington-based World Wildlife Fund that led the two-year study on the migration. He said the main reason that the migration was not detected earlier was because it was impossible to know where the animals were going without GPS tracking technology, which has become more available and affordable in the last two decades. The journey made by about 2,000 zebra who travelled between Namibia and Botswana was discovered by wildlife experts after some of the zebras were collared with tracking devices . The zebra odyssey encompasses a roundtrip journey of 500 kilometers (300 miles), starting in floodplains near the Namibia-Botswana border at the beginning of the wet season. It follows a route across the Chobe River and ends at the seasonally full waterholes and nutritional grass of Nxai Pan National Park in Botswana. The zebras spend about 10 weeks there before heading back. Local residents and conservationists knew the zebras left the Chobe River floodplains and returned months later in the dry season, but they didn't know where the animals went. It wasn't until researchers put satellite tracking collars on eight zebras and monitored their movements in late 2012 and 2013 that the migration was discovered. The findings were published this week in the conservation journal Oryx. 'This is the longest known land migration in Africa, in terms of distance between endpoints,' Naidoo said. The zebra odyssey encompasses a roundtrip journey of 500 kilometers (300 miles), starting in floodplains near the Namibia-Botswana border at the beginning of the wet season . To get the data in a military-style operation,' researchers fired tranquilizer darts at the zebras from a helicopter, landed and affixed GPS collars, Naidoo said in an interview from Vancouver, Canada, where he is an adjunct professor specializing in the environment at the University of British Columbia. David Wilcove, a conservation expert at Princeton University, described the migration as an extraordinary discovery at a time when such mass movements are dwindling. 'Even though people have been fascinated by animal migration since the dawn of history, we are just scratching the surface in terms of understanding which animals migrate, where they go, and how they do it,' Wilcove, who was not involved in the research, wrote in an email. Wildebeest in the Serengeti migration in East Africa meander, possibly covering more ground and certainly migrating in greater numbers than the zebra in Namibia and Botswana. But the southern African zebra move largely in a straight line and the distance between departure and destination points appears to be an average of 10 to 20 kilometers (6 to 12 miles) further than in the Serengeti, according to research cited by Naidoo. The migration follows a route across the Chobe River and ends at the seasonally full waterholes and nutritional grass of Nxai Pan National Park in Botswana . Caribou in North America and Asia, Tibetan antelope and Mongolian gazelles are other animals that travel long migration routes. Other seasonal migrations of note include North America's Monarch butterflies, songbirds in the Americas and humpback whales in the Pacific Ocean. Tony Sinclair, Naidoo's fellow academic at the University of British Columbia and an expert on the Serengeti migration, said the zebra research shows that the animals have to move through 'human-dominated lands' and that the migration could be lost if more protective measures are not put in place. Sinclair wrote in an email that people whose land is traversed by the long migration route may obtain incentives to protect it 'with some innovative thinking,' for example by hooking into tourism. In 2004, a fence that had blocked a zebra migration route since the late 1960s was removed in another part of Botswana. Some 15,000 zebras traveled the re-opened route in 2008-2009, according to research. David Wilcove, a conservation expert at Princeton University, described the migration as an extraordinary discovery at a time when such mass movements are dwindling . Much remains to be learned about the Namibia-Botswana migration. The World Wildlife Fund said long-term research is needed to confirm if the migration is annual and fixed and 'whether this is genetically coded or passed behaviorally from mothers to offspring.' The zebras could have reached similar habitats closer to their starting point but instead chose the longer trek, raising the possibility that they are following a pattern that is so ancient it has become embedded in their genes, according to the Oryx article. Mike Chase, who leads Elephants Without Borders, a Botswana-based group that participated in the zebra migration study, said the trek stirs the heart. 'We all yearn for that, the romance of wild, open spaces,' Chase said. 'There are very few places left on our planet where animals and wildlife have the natural ability to roam in the context in which they evolved over thousands of years.'","The journey was made by about 2,000 zebra who travelled between Namibia and Botswana .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The U.S. Navy's submarine bases are some of the most high-security installations in the world, but one of the most important is located at a lake in landlocked Idaho. The Navy's Acoustic Research Detachment (ARD) at Bayview, Idaho, has supported every major submarine design development of the last 65 years. Although located some 375 miles from the ocean, it has been called ‘the U.S. Submarine force's most important body of water"" by Admiral Edmund Giambastiani, who once headed the Navy's submarine warfare group. Although located some 375 miles from the ocean, the Navy's Acoustic Research Detachment at Bayview, Idaho, has supported every major submarine design development of the last 65 years . ARD is located on the banks of Lake Pend Oreille, which provides the perfect conditions for testing new submarine advancements as conditions closely mimic the ocean, reports FoxtrotAlpha. At about 1150 feet, the lake is deeper than Loch Ness, while its large size, clear water and quiet conditions - provided by steep tree-lined shores and a flat muddy bottom - mean it has been a key testing location for the Navy since WWII. The lake also stays remarkably calm for its size and maintains a constant chilly temperature under 100 feet. Much of the testing is done using a large network of extremely sensitive hydrophones placed in key locations on, or tethered to, the bottom of the lake. The Navy's Acoustic Research Detachment is located on the banks of Lake Pend Oreille, which provides the perfect conditions for testing new submarine advancements as conditions closely mimic the ocean . One of the buoyant vessels housed at ARD Bayview, Idaho, used for testing new developments from the U.S. Navy . The main testing area is called the Intermediate Scale Measuring System which is a 1,000 foot diameter circle of hydrophones mounted on the bottom of the lake or suspended via buoys. It is a controlled environment created to evaluate a vehicle's signature and sensors. The Buoyant Vehicle Test Range is used to measure the sound that the forward sections of a submarine design, mainly its bow, makes while moving through the water. It allows for better bow sonar acuity and quieter subs. The Large Scale Vehicle Range is where 1/4 scale submarines, which usually closely resemble operational subs of both past and present, go out and run through their paces under their own power. Marines guard the world's largest unmanned submarine, the 111 foot LSV 2 Cutthroat being housed at ARD Bayview . This allows for a wide variety of items to be tested, such as a boat's wake signature, new sail designs, propeller noise, new sub-scale propulsion concepts and propulsor configurations and a design's active handling capabilities. There are two known Large Scale Vehicles currently in service at ARD Bayview. The LSV-1 Kokanee is a 1/4 scale model of the Seawolf Class of American subs. It is 90 feet long by ten feet wide and can travel at 3,000hp. The second, known as LSV-2 Cutthroat, is the largest unmanned submarine in the world at 110 feet long. She was designed to be modular in nature and can travel at up to 6,000hp. Over the years, ARD Bayview has helped save the Navy billions of dollars as they seek to develop more advanced submarines.

"By . Charles Sale . Former elite referee Mark Halsey is expected to leave BT Sport at the end of the season following the failed experiment of having an ex-official in the gantry alongside the match commentator. However, Halsey's demise also follows a serious falling-out with his former employers at the  Professional Game Match Officials after he criticised refereeing standards and called for the head of PGMO boss Mike Riley in a newspaper article. After Halsey’s incendiary comments were published, BT Sport allegedly reacted to huge pressure from the Premier League by taking him off their live coverage. Promises from the network at the time that he would stay fully involved in other football programming have not materialised. He's off: Mark Halsey is set to be ditched as a football co-commentator by BT Sport . On the pitch: Halsey, in his former career as a ref, shows Liverpool's Jonjo Shelvey (second left) a red card during the Premier League match against Manchester United at Anfield in September 2012 . Team BT: (left-right) Jake Humphrey, Michael Owen, Steve McManaman and David James in the studio . And it’s believed that Halsey, who has remained on the BT payroll, will be quietly paid off in June, the station not wanting to further antagonise the Premier League with the next TV rights tender possibly starting in November. A BT spokesman said: ‘Mark Halsey is a regular contributor,’ although the controversial referee has not been seen on screen since last December. The PL have repeatedly insisted they have not interfered in BT’s use of Halsey. Yet the 52-year-old sent an email to his lawyers at London’s Pump Court Chambers that read: ‘Richard Scudamore (PL chief executive) rang Marc Watson, the head man of BT, demanding they sack me. I received a phone call from Grant Best (BT football chief) telling me I had been stood down due to the article.’ The RFU’s initiative of having the England team bond with supporters will see the players walk through the packed Twickenham west car park on Saturday rather than take the team bus all the way into the stadium. And fliers will be handed out at the railway station publicising the 2.30pm arrival of the team coach ahead of the Ireland game. Yet they still want to keep the long walk informal by not announcing the players’ names as they leave the bus, as Manchester City do at the Etihad Stadium.

There could be another twist to the provocative decision by MCC to ask England outcast Kevin Pietersen to play in their bicentenary showcase match against the Rest of the World at Lord’s on July 5. The only previous occasion on which KP played for MCC was in the 2004 game against champion county Sussex, when the Lord’s team was captained by Andy Flower and included Alastair Cook - his two arch-critics.

"By . Ryan Gorman . Alaska will soon begin providing free pregnancy tests to women in bar bathrooms. The new program was birthed by Republican Senator Pete Kelly to help fight fetal alcohol syndrome, he said earlier this year – but is against the state providing contraception in a similar manner. The University of Alaska is spearheading the effort in an attempt to lower Alaska’s highest-in-the-nation rate of the devastating affliction. Man with a plan: Senator Pete Kelly (R-AK) first proposed the program back in March . Kelly raised more than a few eyebrows when he first proposed the idea in March, but it has received significant backing. Lawmakers have approved a two-year, $400,000 pilot to determine how effective such a strategy is, according to the Anchorage Daily News. Tests will be made available in 20 bars across the state as early as December, but contraception will notably be absent. Kelly says the tests are to alert women in the early stages of pregnancy to make a more educated decision about whether to drink or not – 20 per cent of Alaskan women binge drink during their pregnancies, according to the state. ‘This assumes that if you know (you are pregnant) you’ll act responsibly,’ Kelly said during a March interview with the paper. As many as 5,000 of the $1.50 tests will be made available during the first 12 months, according to the paper. Testing center: Bar bathrooms across the 'Land of the Midnight Sun' will be outfitted with vending machines similar to this one found in Minnesota . He purposely chose not to include birth control because he feels that would target a different crowd. ‘Birth control is for people who don’t necessarily want to act responsibly,’ he continued. ‘I’m not going to tell them what to do. Or help them do it. That’s their business.’ Kelly argued during the wide-ranging interview that birth control is ‘social engineering that we don’t want to get into’ but expressed hope that most people will ‘make the right decision’ if properly informed. David Driscoll, director for the University of Alaska Anchorage Institute of Circumpolar Health Studies, told the Daily News that condom dispensing machines will also be placed in bar bathrooms. The condoms will not be paid for with state money. Alaska is not the first state to offer such a program, bar bathroom tests are also available in Minnesota, and an advocate there said it works, but only among non-problem drinkers. ‘This is not a strategy for the chronic alcoholic who is drinking regardless of whatever message they see,’ Jody Allen Crowe, executive director of Healthy Brains for Children, told the Daily News. ‘This is really focused on the 50 percent of unexpected pregnancies, to find out they are pregnant as early as possible.’ The university will conduct a study concurrent with the pilot to see if it has an impact on the rate of FASD in the country’s northern-most state. Posters advertising the effort will be put up around three cities and other larger towns offering $15 iTunes gift cards to women who take a telephone survey.","The effort is meant to combat the state's highest-in-the-nation rate of fetal alcohol syndrome .

"By . Ryan Gorman . An eight-year-old California boy with dreams of being a pilot died only two days before Father’s Day from injuries sustained in a plane crash earlier this week. Sebastian Joshua Grewal, of Hesperia, succumbed Friday night to injuries he suffered in the June 9 crash. Pilot Brian Lee, 47, made it to a local hospital but died hours later. Grewal and Lee never stood a chance, the horrific crash saw the single-engine plane slam in the ground and flip multiple times as it left a debris trail of more than 90 feet. The boy’s father held him as he died. Tragic death: Eight-year-old Sebastian Grewal perished from injuries suffered in the crash . Heartbroken: Father Josh Grewal is devastated over the loss of his 'best friend' and 'everything' only 36 hours before Father's Day . ‘Sebastian passed away last evening peacefully in my arms, surrounded by family. I will cherish the 8 years I had with him on this earth and will re-unite with him when it is my time,’ Joshua Grewal wrote on Facebook. ‘I am humbled and comforted by all the love and support from every one… as I go through the most difficult and darkest hour of my entire life.’ The child loved flying and dreamed of one day becoming a pilot himself, his father said. His final flight was when he was airlifted from the scene to a children’s hospital. Doctors performed multiple surgeries to try to save his life, including one procedure meant to relieve pressure on his brain, his father told the Victorville Daily Press. Sebastian Grewal miraculously survived the spectacular crash. He fought five days to stay alive before his body gave out on him. Shattered: Both Sebastian Grewal's mother and father are no coping with the loss of their only child . Nearly unrecognizable: A man walks near the remains of the small plane after Monday's crash . Joshua Grewal initially held out hope his son would survive. ‘My sweet little boy, my best friend, my EVERYTHING suffered extensive brain injuries in the plane crash and they are doing everything they can.’ Sebastian Grewal was on the plane with Lee, a 25-year veteran firefighter with decades of experience flying helicopters for the Los Angeles Fire Department. Investigators are still working to determine the cause of the crash, but weather is not believed to be a factor. ‘The pilot began experiencing some . problems…caused the aircraft to go into a nosedive. When he tried to . correct and land the aircraft, the aircraft began doing a couple of . barrel rolls,’ San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department spokesperson . Randy Naquin told KCAL. Behind the controls: Veteran firefighter Brian Lee was piloting the plane when it went down . Under investigation: Officials comb the accident scene for evidence . Lee was taking several people on short flights, including many other retired firefighters. ‘What we came to find out was the aircraft had been towed here by the firefighters. They were out here, basically, camping,’ Naquin added. Lee is survived by twin daughters. Sebastian leaves behind his mother and father.","Sebastian Grewal was badly injured when the plane crashed June 9 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Newly-crowned Miss USA has been answering critics who have accused her of cheating her way to the crown and thus her eligibility in the beauty pageant. Nia Sanchez won the coveted title last weekend, but some have claimed that she did not really live in Nevada, so shouldn't have been allowed into that state's pageant. Miss Sanchez has stated categorically that Nevada is her home and that she did not cheat her way to victory. 'Nothing . could have been more thrilling for me than to have won the Miss USA . title. I have lived in Nevada since the fall of 2012 and it was an honor . for me to represent the state at Miss USA,' she said in a statement. Cheater? Newly-crowned Miss USA Nia Sanchez answered questions about her Nevada residency in an interview with Fox News . After three consecutive failed . attempts to win the Miss California USA crown, in 2010, 2011 and 2012, . Sanchez, 24, won the Miss Nevada competition in January. However, unnamed sources have suggested Miss Sanchez only met the Nevada pageant's . minimum residency requirements to compete for the crown, but she didn't . actually live in the Silver State. 'She never actually moved to Nevada, but continued to work at Disney and live in California, setting up some minimum paper trail to appear like she was in Nevada and allow her to compete,' a 'well-placed' source told Fox News. 'Shanna Moakler is the Nevada director, and she personally coached Nia on what she needed to do to qualify in Nevada and skirt around the need to be actually from there.' California girl: Miss Nevada Nia Sanchez won the competition last Sunday night, but sources say she lives in Los Angeles . Not true: Sanchez says there's 'no truth' to the claims and that she has been living in Las Vegas, working as a model, for the past 18 months which is more than the six-month residency rule . Moakler won the Miss USA competition . in 1995 and went on to become the director of the Nevada pageant in 2011. However, Sanchez says there's 'no truth' to the claim she received . special treatment. She says . she competed in the pageant by the books, living in Nevada for more than . 18 months before signing up which is longer than the required six-month . residency rule. '[Las Vegas] is my home,' Sanchez said. 'I have a house there with a friend.' The Miss Universe Organization told ABC News there is 'no reason to question her residency.' Could they have won? Audra Mari, Miss North Dakota (left) came second in the contest and Miss Georgia Tiana Griggs (right) came a respectable third in line to the crown . Small pond: Sources say many Californian girls set up residency in Nevada because there's less women to compete against in the neighboring state . Nervous embrace: Miss North Dakota USA Audra Mari, left, and Miss Nevada USA Nia Sanchez await the final decision . 'I actually had an agent that was working with me in Nevada a lot so I figured why not work in that state, and then I looked into the pageant program because I had done pageants before,' she explained. 'So I figured why not look into the one in Nevada? I really liked the way that it was run, the director that ran it, it seemed like a really healthy, well-run state program. So I decided to go there since I was living there anyway.' According to her Miss USA application, Sanchez currently works for AC Model Agency which has branches in both Las Vegas and Los Angeles but her profile with the company lists her as living in California. She defenends the profile, saying that's where all the lucrative modeling jobs are at but that most of her work is done in Las Vegas. Before that, she worked at Disneyland as a princess and competed in the Miss California competition in 2010, 2011 and 2012. Another source said California pagaent queens often cross the state line to compete in Nevada becamase 'it was easier there'.

In California, pagaent girls went up against 100-200 other women whereas there were only 33 in the pool for Nevada's competition. Sanchez says it's just not true that the competition is eaiser in Nevada. 'At least this year in Nevada, we had such strong compeititon. All the girls were not only beautiful, they were smart, college-educated well-rounded women…. I think it was a really tough competition.' However there are other pagaent insiders who think it's wrong to move to compete in a different state, even if the girls do it according to competition rules. 'Most women are really proud to represent their home state, and it starts to become unfair to the hometown contestants competing when this happens,' said Angie Meyer, a former PR representative for the Miss California pageant. 'If you can’t win at home, you have no business competing elsewhere.'

"By . Associated Press . The backlash against the Common Core is growing as home-schooling and other parents increasingly demand the end of the controversial education standards. The anti-Common Core forces scored a victory last week when Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin signed legislation to repeal the rules in her state. Home-schooling mothers like Jenni White are often leading the charge, becoming a frequent presence at legislative hearings and other political functions.White, president of Restore Oklahoma Public Education, helped organize rallies, robo calls and letters to legislators encouraging the repeal. 'You name it. We had to do it,' White said. 'We just had to do it out of a shoestring budget out of our own accounts.' Megan King, pictured with her sons Joshua, 9, left, and Benjamin, 11, pulled them out of their public elementary school in part of because of her opposition to the Common Core math standards . Home-schooling parents can teach their kids what they choose, but many of these parents still have a big beef with the standards. Facebook groups such as 'Home Schooling Without Common Core' have popped up. A Home School Legal Defense Association produced video on the standards has been viewed online hundreds of thousands of times. 'All parents should be concerned about this. This is our children. To me, it's not political,' said Megan King of Lawrence, Kansas. She pulled two of her three sons out of their public elementary school, in part, because of the math standards, and she co-founded Kansans Against Common Core. The standards, adopted in more than 40 states and the District of Columbia, spell out what math and English skills public school students should master at each grade. They were pushed by governors concerned that too few graduates were ready for life after high school. Use of the standards has become a hot button issue in many states, and governors in Indiana and South Carolina recently signed legislation repealing them. The issue has pitted Chamber of Commerce-aligned Republicans with grassroots conservatives, including many home-schooling parents. The Common Core effort was led by the states, but the Obama administration has offered incentives to those that adopted 'college and career' ready standards. That has led to charges of federal intrusion. The concern that the more education policy is centralized, 'the less control they have as citizens' motivates many of these home-schooling parents, said Emmett McGroarty, director of education at the conservative American Principles Project. Some of these parents, like King, believe the standards are poorly designed. King said she believes the math standards are developmentally inappropriate for younger kids, not rigorous enough for older students and too heavy on pushing informational text over literature. Other home-schoolers fear that as textbook publishers incorporate the standards, it will lead to a smaller number of non-Common Core based-textbooks, said White, from Luther, Oklahoma. She says she teaches her children using 'classically' aligned texts. McGroarty said there is a concern that the ACT and the College Board, which owns the SAT, are moving toward aligning with the standards. That, he said, would leave home-schooling parents no choice other than to follow the standards if they want their kids to do well on the college entrance exams. An ACT official said the company supports the Common Core standards, but the exam hasn't changed because of them. The College Board, which is revamping the SAT, has said the new version of the exam isn't aligned to a single set of standards. Joshua King waits for his computer to boot at home in Lawrence, Kansas, after his mother pulled him out of school because of the new math standards . Mike Donnelly of the Home School Legal Defense Association, based in Purcellville, Virginia, said there isn't anything 'inherently objectionable' in the Common Core standards, but there is concern that if the standards become more mainstream, there will be more pressure for home-schooled students to conform to them. A majority of states do not require home-schooled students to take a standardized assessment. In those that do, parents are offered a range of standardized assessments they can use, so it's possible that home-schooling students in some states could take a Common Core-based assessment or that in future years there will be fewer options for these students, Donnelly said. 'That's the concern we have, that our students are going to be marginalized by this Common Core system and we'll have difficulty and we'll be pressured and pulled into kind of participating, and we don't want to do that,' Donnelly said. Today, home schooling is much more acceptable than it was in the past, and an estimated 3 percent of students are educated at home today, according to Education Department statistics. Years of political battles taught these families to be 'very politically savvy', McGroarty said. Michael Petrilli, executive vice president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, an education think tank, has testified before state legislative bodies in favor of the standards. He said the issue goes beyond the standards themselves. 'This is much more of a fundamental, ideological concern for them', he said. Carmel Martin, a former Obama administration Education Department official who is the executive vice president for policy at the liberal Center for American Progress, said she finds home-schooling parents' opposition to the standards a bit 'perplexing'. 'Those families make a personal choice, which is a legitimate choice that they are going to handle their child's education at home, so the Common Core doesn't really affect them', Martin said. 'They have the option just like a private school to decide what curriculum is going to be used for their children.' Shane Vander Hart, a home-schooling dad in Des Moines, Iowa, runs two conservative-bent web sites and has done contract work for the American Principles Project. He said that even though his family is 'going to do what we're going to do anyway', he's concerned about what the standards will do to public education. 'A one size fits all approach does not work and that's one of the primary reasons many of us homeschool,' Vander Hart said.","More parents are pulling their children out of school because of the new educational standards .
Oklahoma became the third state to repeal Common Core following a fierce lobbying campaign led by home-schooling mothers ."

The former model, 26, and another runner, Kate Sanderson, suffered burns to more than 60 per cent of their bodies after they became trapped in a bushfire while running an outback marathon in the Kimberley Region of Western Australia in 2011. The Supreme Court action was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum. Scroll down for video . Ms Pitt has agreed an out-of-court settlement from Hong Kong-based ultramarathon organisers Racing The Planet . The 26-year-old, pictured left in 2007 before suffering her horrific injuries, still leads an active lifestyle. She is pictured right hiking in the Whitsundays in April this year . Ms Pitt's boyfriend Michael Hoskin said it got settled through mediation and the couple were glad the process was over. 'You can’t really speak about whether it was a good or great outcome, there's no winners, it’s just an outcome you know, but it’s really good to have that behind us now, so we can move forward,' Mr Hoskin told 60 Minutes for a program to air this Sunday. 'We don’t even have to think about that ever again.' When asked if she felt that she can now let go, Ms Pitt said 'Yeah I think so yeah'. She added that psychologically it was a good thing. 'Yeah of course it’s a good thing. I mean I can move on.' Ms Pitt, pictured with her boyfriend Michael Hoskin, received burns to 64 per cent of her body when she became trapped in a bushfire in Western Australia's Kimberley Region . Ms Pitt (right) with her boyfriend (left) and helicopter pilot Paul Cripps (centre) who rescued Turia in 2011 . Ms Pitt launched the court action in February last year after a WA parliamentary inquiry found Hong Kong-based Racing The Planet did not take reasonable steps to ensure the safety of competitors. Ms Pitt's lawyer Greg Walsh said she had shown enormous courage and dignity. 'I'm very relieved and happy for her and (her boyfriend) Michael (Hoskin) that this matter has now come to an end,' Mr Walsh told the West Australian. 'She will be left with horrific injuries for the rest of her life but at least she won't have to put up with the stress and worry of a protracted court case.' In 2012 Ms Pitt and Ms Sanderson, 38, were awarded $450,000 by the WA government as an 'Act of Grace'. Western Australia Tourism Minister Dr Kim Hames said that the money was to 'assist in alleviating their financial stress while they explore other options.' The bushfire which injured competitors including Ms Pitt in the ultramarathon in Western Australia's Kimberley region in 2011 . The 26-year-old threw a fundraiser cocktail party earlier this month to raise money for Interplast, an organisation that provides free reconstructive surgery for people in developing countries . Ms Pitt, who was working in mining engineering when she entered the marathon race, told a 2012 inquiry that she wasn't even planning to enter the event because she thought the entry fee was ridiculous. But two weeks before the marathon on September 2 2011, she was invited by organisers to compete for free. She was joined in the event by adventure enthusiast Ms Sanderson and 40 other runners who were destined to run across the parched outback Kimberley region of north west Australia. But part-way through the race Ms Pitt and Ms Sanderson, along with two male competitors, became trapped by a bushfire in a narrow, rocky gorge. The former model launched a Supreme Court action against Racing The Planet in February last year after a damning WA parliamentary inquiry . Ms Pitt's injuries were so bad that not only did she suffer burns to 64 per cent of her body, she also had four fingers from her left hand and her right thumb amputated. Ms Sanderson had to have her left foot amputated, lost part of her earlobes and part of her right index finger. They told the inquiry earlier they had no idea they were running into danger because the organisers had spoken only 'in passing' about spot fires. Ms Pitt said she and Ms Sanderson would have died at the gorge if not for a risky rescue mission undertaken by a helicopter crew. Ms Pitt pictured before a recovery operation earlier this year .

Joint Media Statement Issued By Turia Pitt and RacingtheplanetThere has been extensive misreporting in the media about the settlement reached between Turia Pitt and RacingThePlanet. Turia Pitt and RacingThePlanet are issuing this joint statement to correct the misreporting. Turia Pitt and RacingThePlanet are pleased that a settlement has been reached and that the parties have avoided a lengthy and uncertain court case. The settlement represents a  commercial outcome that involved both parties making compromises. Contrary to certain media reports, there have been no admissions of liability. Media reports as to the settlement amount are also wildly incorrect. RacingThePlanet deeply regrets the injuries suffered by Ms Pitt but strongly denies that it was in any way liable for them. RacingThePlanet wishes Ms Pitt all the very best for the future. It hopes that the settlement enables her to move on from this tragic event and to continue to make the fantastic progress in her recovery that has been evident to date. Ms Pitt and RacingThePlanet will not be making any further comment in relation to the settlement.RacingThePlanet believes it is clear that the fire that burnt Ms Pitt was deliberately lit and is very concerned that this has not been properly investigated (including by the WA Parliamentary inquiry) nor has the culprit been held to account. RacingThePlanet welcomes recent initiatives by the WA Acting Minister for Tourism to re-open these investigations and is willing to assist in any way it can."
"By . Mia De Graaf . Created: . 06:55 EST, 20 December 2013 . Banned: Paul Crick, 45, routinely called the emergency services and disturbed neighours by screaming and shouting . An alcoholic has been banned from swearing in his own home for five years after calling 999 over 170 times in 16 months - only to abuse them when they came to his aid. Paul Crick, 45, was finally arrested in August when his relentless calls to the emergency line, which started in April 2012, showed no sign of stopping. Neighbours in Waltham Abbey, Essex, also complained about Crick's constant shouting and swearing. Today, Essex Police revealed he has been given an ASBO that bars him from swearing anywhere - even in his own home. He is also banned from dialling 999 unless in a genuine emergency. An Essex Police spokesman said: 'The court heard how he makes regular unnecessary calls to the emergency services, causes a significant level of disturbance and distress to his neighbours. 'The ASBO was deemed necessary to prevent him from causing further harassment, alarm or distress to his neighbours. 'It was stated that Crick prevents the emergency services from dealing with cases of genuine emergency and appears to use any opportunity to abuse employees of Essex Police and the ambulance service.' Presiding magistrate Russell Pearson told Chelmsford Magistrate's Court: 'No shouting, even in your own home if you are heard by all your neighbours.' Crick, who told the court he is attending an alcohol support group and psychiatrist, did not object to the ruling and £200 costs. Crick was handed an ASBO that bars him from NHS premises and calling the emergency line for five years . The order states Crick must not contact the emergency services via 999 save when genuinely in need of assistance of those services or use foul language in a public place or in his home. He is also banned from acting in a threatening manner towards people not of his own household, and must leave NHS premises if ordered by a member of staff. The ASBO expires on December 16, 2018.

Yet G4S and the Ministry of Justice dismissed these claims as 'completely untrue'. One of Britain's largest with 1,600 inmates, Oakwood Prison was described as a model for future prisons by the government yet has been beset by   controversy. Yet the animal therapy scheme has been has been greeted with some cynicism. They are allowed to feed, clean out the animals and take them for walks in the grounds, but they are not allowed to take them back to their cells . A source in the prison told the Sunday Mirror: 'How on Earth can it be right that dangerous inmates are being treated to their own furry friends? 'It is bizarre to say the least but the idea is that animals have a soothing effect on the most disturbed inmates. 'After the riot earlier in the year it seems they will try anything to calm the inmates down.' In October inspectors gave it a damning report - quoting one prisoner who said drugs were easier to get hold of than basics like soap. A G4S spokesperson said: 'Animal therapy a common technique used to develop a sense of responsibility and ownership for prisoners. 'That is why we have   a number of small animals, including two rescued greyhound dogs that are kept in kennels.' Although prisoners have been allowed to keep pets since as far back as 1792, animal therapy was first used in America in the late 1980s and has spread   throughout the world.","Prisoners in HMP Oakwood are also allowed to care for dogs and rabbits .

He was charged with stealing drugs, and his gun was confiscated. He was released from jail on $1,000 bail. His phone has been disconnected, and he couldn't be reached for comment. Madison police Officer Eric Bronson said Smith was carrying a .40-caliber Glock but isn't facing any gun charges because Maine is an open-carry state and his weapon was visible. Smith's next court date is August 6th. Smith made headlines in March when members of a tree removal crew he'd told to clear off his property reported that he had a gun. But the gun turned out to be his tattoo. He told the newspaper then that the tattoo had never been a problem before. He wasn't charged in that case.

"By . Lillian Radulova . Adelaide mother, Danni McLean, discovered the blade while preparing a meal for her daughter . An Adelaide mother discovered a two-centimetre razor-sharp metal shard in a packet of organic baby food she was about to feed the nine-month-old daughter. Danni McLean was emptying a packet of Woolworths' Organic Baby Macro food to feed to her daughter Willow, when the food started leaking out of a cut towards the bottom of the packet. Ms McLean said she felt around the cut, and discovered the two-centimetre blade covered in baby food. Ms McLean said she contacted the supermarket, and then took to Facebook to warn others about the potentially deadly discovery. Her post has gone viral since being uploaded on Thursday, with over 5,000 shares in two days. 'Let me start by saying Woolworths is acting on this matter urgently however recalling a product of the shelves takes too long and I need to relieve myself of this burden in keeping it secret and make sure other mothers are aware ASAP,' Ms McLean wrote on the social media website. She was shocked to discover the two centimetre long blade when it cut through the opposite end of the sachet on Thursday . Danni McLean found the shard of metal in a Woolworths' Organic Baby Macro meal which she was preparing for her nine-month-old daughter Willow . 'Do not buy macro baby food at the moment as the photos below show you what I found in Willows food yesterday! 'That sharp object covered in oily grease is a blade about 2 cm long. As I was squeezing the food into a bowl yesterday I felt something in my hands and was all the food coming out from the other end along with a blade! #thisisnotorganic.' Photos taken by the Ms McLean, show the blade protruding out of the bottom of the pouch of Organic Tomato Chicken with Pasta Puree, having pierced the base of the sachet. After notifying Woolworths and receiving no reply in 24 hours, she took to social media to warn other mothers from buying the product . Later that day she reported that a Woolworths representative arrived at her home to collect the blade and packet for testing. Woolworths has since issued a recall for the nationally sold product. However they have only recalled the singular batch of Tomato Chicken and Pasta flavour, offering a full refund to its customers. A Woolworths spokesman said: 'We would like to sincerely apologise to the customer for not keepingher informed about the investigation after she contacted us on Wednesday. 'We are fully investigating this incident. All Macro baby food in this type of packaging is x-rayed before leaving the manufacturer and after discussion with them we are confident in ruling that out as a source. 'Our initial investigation shows the product was not spoilt which indicated the blade entered the packaging not long before the customer found it. 'We will continue our investigation to get to the bottom of it but we think this is an isolated incident. 'As a precautionary measure we withdrew the product from shelves immediately after being informed by the customer.'","Adelaide mum found metal shard in a packet of Macro Organic baby food .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Aldi is piling pressure on the supermarket giants by pledging to double its number of stores nationwide. Buoyed by the scale of its success in attracting millions of new customers, the German discount chain has vowed to double its size to 1,000 stores in the next seven years, according to a report yesterday. Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons have seen their profits fall  as more families switch to Aldi’s cheaper products. Aldi claims it will be adding between 50 and 65 new stores a year until 2021 when they should have 1,000 stores across the country . Joint managing director Matthew Barnes said that Aldi plans to accelerate store openings from 50 to 65 a year from next year. If it achieves that rate of growth every year, it will hit 1,000 stores  by 2021. It also plans to upgrade its existing stores. ‘For the foreseeable future, 65 new stores a year is not out of the question,’ Mr Barnes said. ‘We think 1,000 stores is an absolute possibility.’ By contrast the biggest supermarkets have been struggling -- Tesco’s sales fell 3.1per cent and Morrisons’ sales were down 3.9per cent. The discounter is also working on plans to upgrade its existing stores to boost sales and steal even more customers from its big rivals. Aldi says that it has been building extensions and bigger car parks because in some locations it has been a victim of its own success leading to bottlenecks in car parks or at tills. Retail experts believe that the discount retailers are benefiting as they seek better value than that on offer from traditional supermarkets such as Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons .","Aldi is planning to open between 50 to 65 stores a year until 2021 .

"By . Craig Hope . Follow @@CraigHope01 . Paul Scholes has likened Ross Barkley to the Wayne Rooney of 2004 and has urged Roy Hodgson to unleash his young Lions on Italy. It was at the European Championships in Portugal 10 years ago that a teenage Rooney exploded on to the international scene, scoring four times during the group stage before succumbing to injury in the quarter-final exit to the hosts. And Scholes believes Barkley - who missed the team coach ahead of the first training session in Brazil but has impressed in the warm-up matches - should start when England open their World Cup campaign against the Italians in Manaus on Saturday. Speaking his mind: Paul Scholes has discussed England's forthcoming game against Italy in his latest blog . On the ball: Ross Barkley, in training for England on Wednesday, could be the next Rooney, according to Scholes . Joe Hart; Glen Johnson; Gary Cahill, Phil Jagielka, Leighton Baines; Steven Gerrard, Ross Barkley; Daniel Sturridge, Danny Welbeck, Raheem Sterling; Wayne Rooney . ‘None of the big teams fear England in this World Cup. Let’s give them something to worry about. Ross Barkley must start,’ said the former Manchester United star in his latest column for Paddy Power. ‘I was watching the England versus Ecuador friendly in an airport lounge, a bit back from the screen. In the first-half Barkley went on a run and I thought, “Bloody hell, is that Rooney?”. ‘Barkley made me think of Wayne at Euro 2004. I had to take a second look because I thought it was Wayne. Barkley has no fear.’ Teen talent: Wayne Rooney scored four times for England at Euro 2004 . Joker in the pack: Wayne Rooney enjoys Glen Johnson's company as England prepare for Italy on Saturday . United front: Rooney is set for his third World Cup but didn't find the net on his previous two outings . Scholes, . however, fears that England could stumble through their group before . exiting the tournament in customary fashion via a penalty shootout. And that is why he insists a shift towards youth is what Hodgson needs. ‘This . could be just me, but how do England play football? I don’t know. It . seems there’s speculation before every game about how we are going to . approach the match tactically,’ he went on. ‘Two up front? One up front? Wide players? Holding midfielders? ‘The strength of the England squad is this new breed of players who are enthusiastic, athletic and attack-minded. ‘There . is no point taking people like Raheem Sterling or Barkley to Brazil . “for the experience”. Play them. 'Some might say it’s risky. But these . players have the fitness and ability to get the ball back if they lose . it - hopefully not in dangerous positions.  You want them to attack and . give the opposition problems. ‘Now is a great chance for Roy Hodgson to give English football the identity we’ve lacked. ‘Do . we want to go to a major tournament, get a couple of nil-all draws, a . one-nil and then we might scrape through the group before we go out on . penalties in the last 16 or quarter finals? There’s no future for . England in this approach. ‘Hodgson . has little to lose by going for the jugular in Rio.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The Federal bureau of Investigations has joined the search for a Florida woman who's alleged to have kidnapped her daughter to keep the girl's father from having her vaccinated and 'brainwashed.' Robert Baumann, the father of 2-year-old Lilly Everett, hasn't seen his daughter since May 6, when he dropped her off with her mother, 22-year-old Megan Elizabeth Everett. He thinks Everett wants to keep the girl from school so she can home-school her and teach her about the confederacy. Lilly was supposed to be returned to Baumann the following week, per the terms of the custody agreement between the parents. Missing: Lilly Everett, seen here playing with live rounds of ammunition, hasn't been seen since her father dropped her off with her mother on May 6 . Lilly's mother, Megan Everett, left a cryptic note explaining why she took her daughter so her father wouldn't get her vaccinated . Lilly, however, was never returned, and now Everett is on the run after leaving a cryptic note explaining why she'd taken her daughter. 'You are a great dad,' she wrote in the note to her current boyfriend, Carlos Lesters. 'If I . let them take her and vaccinate her and brainwash her, I wouldn't be . doing what's right. I cannot let a judge tell me how my daughter should . be raised. We will miss you. But I had to leave.' On May 19, a circuit court judge in Broward County signed a federal warrant for Everett's arrest on charges of kidnapping, interference with custody and concealing a minor . contrary to a court order. The warrant accuses the young mother of crossing state lines to avoid prosecution on state charges. Worried: Lilly's father, Robert Baumann (pictured) shared custody of his daughter with Everett . Everett's family thinks Lilly belongs with her father because of the choices she's been making since moving in with Lester . Even Everett's family believes Lilly belongs with her father, given her mother's state of mind. 'In the state of mind my daughter is in, Lilly would be better off with Robert,' Pam Everett, Megan Everett's mother, told the Sun-Sentinel. 'I have four kids, and Megan is my baby. I don't know what happened to her.' The paper reports that Lilly and Megan lived with Pam Everett until the baby was eight months old, at which point she moved in with Carlos Lesters, whom the Sun-Sentinel describes as 'a Confederate-flag-waving gun enthusiast with family members in Georgia and Kentucky.' Lesters appears to be influencing Everett, according to Baumann. 'One of the issues we had was, she wanted to home-school my daughter,' said Baumann. 'I didn't want that to happen. She didn't want Lilly to . learn about black history. She just wanted her to learn about the . Confederacy.' Guns: Everett's boyfriend, Carlos Lester (pictured) is described as a confederate flag-waving gun enthusiast . Baumann says he thinks Everett's desire to home-school Lilly led to her new-found opposition to vaccinating the girl. 'She found this new idea that vaccines are horrible,' Baumann said. 'I . think she wanted to keep her from being vaccinated because that would . keep her out of day care.' After her disappearance, police went to the home Everett shared with Lester, who told investigators that Everett and Lilly were not there and were 'not coming back,' according to a federal complaint. 'Lesters informed detectives that Everett … knew she would have to live . her life as a fugitive,' the complaint states. 'However, in her mind, . the time that she spent with her daughter ""free"" of Baumann would be ""worth it,"" regardless of how brief the time was.' Police ask anyone with information about the whereabouts of Everett and . Lilly to call 954-746-3600 or Broward Crime Stoppers at 954-493-TIPS .

The steaming liquid poured down Mr . Hayat's chest, leaving him with a huge angry red burn and blisters which . erupted immediately. Father-of-four Khizar Hayat, 40, was travelling on a Qatar Airways flight when another passenger reclined their chair and the hostess tripped -  tipping the boiling hot drink on him. The steaming liquid poured down Mr Hayat's chest, leaving him with a huge angry red burn and blisters which erupted immediately . But he says despite his agony he was 'brushed off' by the airline crew, who merely gave him a damp cloth to dab his injuries with. And although he made a formal complaint to the airway when he landed at Manchester Airport and two follow up emails, Mr Hayat is yet to receive an apology. Mr Hayat says despite his agony he was 'brushed off' by the airline crew, who merely gave him a damp cloth to dab his injuries with . Mr Hayat, of Oldham, Greater Manchester, said the accident happened as the stewardess leaned over him to nearer to his mother in a window seat. He said: 'I was in absolute agony. The pain was incredible. 'As soon as it happened I pulled my shirt open and could see blisters popping up already. 'The air stewardess was quite dismissive actually, she apologised once but none of them seemed very eager to make up for what had happened. 'And on top of that, they didn't seem to be doing much to ease the pain I was in. They gave me a cloth and some water to dab at the burn, which helped initially but whenever I moved it, the pain started again. 'They gave me some gel to put on the burn but that didn't really help. 'I was pacing the floor of the aeroplane because I just couldn't get any relief from the pain. 'I haven't been able to work since it happened, I'm on painkillers and it's even painful wearing clothes - and I'm still waiting for a formal apology.' Mr Hayat, married to 34-year-old Farhat Uzma, was travelling home from a trip visiting family in Pakistan with his mother Safia Begum on April 2. 'We'd flown from Islamabad to Doha, and were on a seven-hour flight back from Doha when it happened,' he explained. 'We were about two hours into the seven hour flight home, when the air stewardess was giving my mother a cup of tea. 'The passenger in front of me reclined their chair as she leaned over me to pass the cup to my mother, and knocked her - so she spilt the tea over me. 'I jumped up with the pain, it was absolute agony. A Qatar Airways plane. 'I'm so angry that they are trying to ignore what happened. I've contacted my solicitor and they are looking into whether I have a case against the airline,' said Mr Hayat . 'The stewardess took me to the front area where they prepare the food and gave me a sachet of gel to put on the burn and some paracetamol. But that didn't stop the pain at all so she gave me a cloth and a bottle of mineral water to cool it down. But whenever I removed the cloth the pain started again. 'About half an hour later the pain hadn't stopped so they put out an announcement for any medically-trained people on board. 'Luckily there were two doctors - one was a GP and the other a surgeon. They said the burn looked bad and asked the steward if there was anything else they could give to me. 'I've been unable to work and can't dress properly because of the injures. The doctor told me it will take a while to heal,' said the father-of-four . 'At this point, a senior cabin crew member, who hadn't been involved before now, gave me another sachet of cream. I don't know what it was. It didn't really help the pain. 'The captain then put out a call to Manchester Airport to tell them to have paramedics ready, so I had to suffer the rest of the flight in pain. 'When we landed, they got all the passengers off before calling the paramedics on board. They put on some more gel and dressed the wound. 'They asked if I wanted an ambulance to take me to hospital but I said I would go to my local hospital as I wanted to get my mother, who's suffered three or four heart attacks in the last couple of years and was very upset about what had happened, home. 'I went to see my GP who gave me flucloxacillin tablets for the pain and a cream to soothe the burns but I've been unable to work and can't dress properly because of the injures. The doctor told me it will take a while to heal.' He added: 'While I was at the airport, a Qatar Airways representative took a statement from me and I said I wanted to make a formal complaint. 'I've since followed this up with two emails to the address she gave me, asking for a reply, but I've had nothing. 'I'm so angry that they are trying to ignore what happened. I've contacted my solicitor and they are looking into whether I have a case against the airline.' Qatar Airways denies Mr Hayat's account of events that it has acted negligently in any respect. Lawyers acting for the airline said it would be inappropriate to comment further as Mr Hayat has instructed his solicitors in the matter.","Father-of-four Khizar Hayat, 40, was travelling home to Manchester .

"By . Rob Waugh . September 21st? Rumours are suggesting an earlier than anticipated launch for Apple's iPhone 5 . The new iPhone will have an even thinner screen thanks to advances in LCD manufacturing, according to reports. The latest Apple gadget will feature ‘in-cell technology’ which has touch sensors in the screen instead of another layer on top as it is now. The difference would make the new iPhone about half a millimeter thinner but the image quality would actually improve, the Wall St Journal claimed. It would also allow Apple to better take on Samsung’s Galaxy S III which has organic light-emitting displays which do not need to be backlit and are thinner than iPhone screens. Samsung has been touting the feature as a major selling point to persuade customers to make the switch. The iPhone 4 is 9.3mm deep compared to 8.6mm for the Galaxy S III. Apple’s liquid crystal makers Sharp, Japan Display Inc and LG Display are said to be making hundreds of thousands of panels that will be used in the new iPhone, possibly the 5th version. A thinner screen would make the device more attractive but would also make extra room for more components or features. It could also allow more space for the battery which could extend the life of the iPhone, a constant complaint amongst users. According to the Wall St Journal . however ‘LCD makers are finding the manufacturing process challenging . and time-consuming’ as they try and find the right balance. There . is mounting speculation that the new iPhone will have a screen that is . larger than the current iPhone’s 3.5 inch display, even though the . company’s late founder Steve Jobs rejected such an idea. It's coming! 9to5Mac has released this image, purported to be the iPhone 5. Features that can be spotted include a much larger screen, and a smaller dock connector . A thinner screen could offset the additional weight and keep it portable enough to compete against Samsung. Former . Apple manager Leslie Grandy was recently quoted as saying a larger . iPhone - or smaller iPad - could be ‘appealing to people who do not now . carry their iPads with them because they are too large and heavy’. She added a seven inch device is too big for a pocket but just the right size for a woman’s handbag.

"By . James Tozer . Pre-school children whose parents are separated should not be allowed to spend the night with their fathers, said a top parenting expert. Psychologist Penelope Leach, whose books have sold millions, accused couples who have split up and arrange sleepovers of putting their own rights ahead of their children’s. She said even one night away from their mothers could cause lasting damage. Yesterday her comments were criticised as insulting and outdated by fathers’ groups, with one calling it ‘absolute poison’. Psychologist Penelope Leach has said that generally children of separated couples aged four and under should not be parted from their mother to have a sleepover with their father . Mrs Leach influenced a generation of mothers in the 1970s with her bestselling book Your Baby & Child: From Birth To Age Five, stressing the importance of establishing a loving bond. But it was also controversial for suggesting only mothers can care adequately for a child and a father’s role is secondary. In her new book, Family Breakdown, the former president of the National  Childminding Association highlights the damage that separating parents can have on even a young baby. She argues that society treats access to children as ‘a right’ rather than focusing on the interests of the child. Mrs Leach writes that ‘when people say . that it’s “only fair” for a father and mother to share their . five-year-old daughter on alternate weeks, they mean it is fair to the . adults – who see her as a possession and her presence as their right – . not that it is fair to the child’. Ms Leach, whose book Your Baby & Child: From Birth to Age Five was a bestseller in 1977, said attempts to share children was putting parents notions of 'rights'  and notion of what is 'fair' above what is best for the child . She believes there is ‘undisputed’  evidence that separating children from their mothers ‘reduces brain development’ and creates a tendency toward ‘unhealthy attachment issues’. The New Fathers4Justice direct action group, said the advice ‘sounds like absolute poison and potentially terribly damaging to children’s development’. A spokesman added: ‘Overnight stays with fathers from as early an age as possible are crucial if children are to form strong attachments with both parents.’ Ian Maxwell, of Families Need Fathers, said her advice went against ‘common sense’ and that ‘the bond between fathers and children is just as important’.","Penelope Leach said children under four should not be parted from mother .
