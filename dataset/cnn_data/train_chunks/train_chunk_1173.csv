"Moving against tax avoidance . by corporations, the Obama administration took several actions . on Monday to curb  'inversion' deals that allow companies to . escape high U.S. taxes by reincorporating abroad. The Treasury Department announced new rules, effective . immediately, that will reduce the tax benefits available to . companies that have inverted, while also making new inversions . more difficult to do and less potentially rewarding. Because they took effect on Monday, the new rules might . raise issues for some of a handful of companies that have . agreed to do inversions, but have not yet completed them. Fast-food chain Burger King Worldwide Inc is in the . midst of inverting to Canada in a deal with coffee-and-donuts . vendor Tim Hortons Inc. A spokeswoman for Burger King . said the company declined to comment. Asked about the impact on pending deals, a senior Treasury . official told reporters on a conference call: 'If they are . closed and done as of today, then they are not subject to this. If they are closed tomorrow or after, they are subject to this.' U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew is the driving force behind a new policy that penalizes companies for avoiding tax es by merging with overseas companies -- a scheme known as a corporate inversion . President Barack Obama, who has sharply criticized inverting . companies, said the Treasury Department's steps would . 'discourage companies from taking advantage of corporate . inversions - moving their tax residence overseas on paper to . avoid paying their fair share in taxes here at home.' The announcement of the rules followed months of growing . concern on Capitol Hill, with Democrats urging prompt . legislative action and Republicans pushing to address the . problem later, perhaps in 2015, as part of a broader overhaul of . the loophole-riddled federal tax code. Companies that do inversions, which are legal and already . subject to certain restrictions, say they are only trying to . minimize their tax bills, which investors expect. About 50 such deals have taken place since the early 1980s, . but half of those have been completed just since the 2008-2009 . credit crisis, according to a Reuters review. Inversions have surged in the past year, pursued by big . companies such as Burger King and medical technology group . Medtronic Inc, which is working to close an inversion . deal into Ireland with rival Covidien Plc. Medtronic spokesman Fernando Vivanco late on Monday told . Reuters: 'We are studying Treasury's actions. We will release . our perspective on any potential impact on our pending . acquisition of Covidien following our complete review.' Medtronic has said it expects to close the Covidien . acquisition by the end of this year or early 2015. Inversions usually involve a U.S. corporation buying a . smaller, foreign rival and redomiciling in its home country, . where taxes are lower, even though core operations typically . remain in the United States. Treasury Secretary Lew said in a statement: 'These first, . targeted steps make substantial progress in constraining the . creative techniques used to avoid U.S. taxes, both in terms of . meaningfully reducing the economic benefits of inversions after . the fact, and when possible, stopping them altogether.' A key target of Treasury's actions is foreign profits held . offshore by U.S. multinationals under a U.S. Internal Revenue . Service (IRS) rule that defers taxation on such profits unless . and until they are brought into the United States. Deal: Fast-food chain Burger King Worldwide Inc is in the midst of inverting to Canada in a deal with coffee-and-donutsvendor Tim Hortons Inc. One new Treasury rule will prevent inverted companies from . using 'hopscotch' loans that allow them to avoid dividend taxes . when tapping such tax-deferred foreign profits. Another rule . will bar inverters from gaining access to the same kinds of . profits by using 'decontrolling' strategies that restructure . foreign units so they are no longer U.S.-controlled. Treasury is also tightening limits on the levels of . ownership that the former U.S. owners can have in an inverted . company to qualify for foreign tax treatment from the IRS, a . move that will make it harder to do these deals. Some companies had feared that new rules might be imposed . retroactively, but they were not. Greg Valliere, chief political strategist at Potomac . Research Group, said the administration 'may succeed in chilling . the climate for further deals, but this was not as strident as . it could have been, especially in that they don't do anything . retroactively.' The rules were the administration's latest effort to tackle . what it sees as a pressing issue by taking executive actions . that side-step a gridlocked Congress. 'When corporations choose to invert and don't pay their fair . share of taxes, they leave the rest of us to pick up the tab,' said Democratic Senator Dick Durbin in a statement. 'Today, the Obama administration put these corporate tax . deserters on notice: we are not going to stand by while they . game the tax code and avoid their responsibility to our . country,' Durbin said. Though in disagreement about the issue's urgency, both . Democrats and Republicans have said inversions are a symptom of . a broken tax code that needs a thorough overhaul, a job that has . eluded Congress and successive presidents since 1986. Senator Orrin Hatch, the top Republican on the tax . law-writing Senate Finance Committee, said in a statement: 'In . the end, any solution that permanently addresses inversions must . be legislated by Congress.'","Common scheme sees US companies merging with foreign corporations so their taxes can be calculated at another country's lower rate .

"Dark energy, the mysterious cosmic force thought to be the fuel behind the accelerating expansion of the universe, is real, according to an Anglo-German team of astronomers. After a two-year study, scientists at the University of Portsmouth in the United Kingdom and LMU University Munich in Germany have concluded that the likelihood of dark energy's existence stands at 99.996 percent. That's the same level of certainty as this year's celebrated discovery of the Higgs boson, or a subatomic particle that looks very much like it, by scientists at the CERN research center near Geneva. A 2009 simulation of dark matter in the Universe: Researcher now say they are (almost) certain it exists. Although accepted by many scientists as the best explanation for why the universe is expanding at an ever-faster rate, the theory of dark energy has its skeptics. Astronomers studying the brightness of distant supernovae over a decade ago won the 2011 Nobel Prize for Physics for their conclusion that the expansion of the universe was accelerating. But some scientists argue this is an illusion, caused by the relative movement of Earth in relation to the rest of the cosmos. Others suggest shortcomings in our understanding of gravity are more likely responsible than dark energy. 'Dark energy is one of the great scientific mysteries of our time, so it isn't surprising that so many researchers question its existence,' said Bob Nichol, a member of the Portsmouth team involved in the research, which was published in the academic journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. 'But with our new work, we're more confident than ever that this exotic component of the universe is real - even if we still have no idea what it consists of.' A basic premise of modern cosmology is that the visible universe of stars, planets and gases makes up about 4 percent of the cosmos and is sitting like flotsam in a massive sea of unknown material referred to as dark energy. Dark energy is thought to make up 73 percent of the cosmos, while the slightly less mysterious dark matter comprises the remaining 23 percent. One of the strongest pieces of evidence for dark energy is in the so-called Integrated Sachs Wolfe effect.In 1967, Rainer Sachs and Arthur Wolfe theorized that light from the radiation from the heat left over from the Big Bang, would become slightly more blue as it passed through the gravitational fields of lumps of matter in the universe, an effect known as gravitational redshift. The existence of dark energy would cause light from this residual radiation to gain energy as it travels through large lumps of mass. In 1996, astronomers Robert Crittenden and Neil Turok suggested overlaying a map of the local universe on the picture of the residual cosmic radiation could provide clues about where to look for the effect. In 2003, it was spotted, albeit weakly. Researchers have spent decades investigating the phenomenon - but have never been able to prove it actually exists. It was seen as supporting evidence for dark energy and hailed as the 'Discovery of the Year' in Science magazine. But some scientists argued it could have been caused by cosmic dust and questioned the discovery. The Anglo-German team that carried out the latest study was led by Crittenden and Tommaso Giannantonio. They re-examined all the arguments against the detection and have improved the maps used in the original work. They conclude that dark energy is almost certainly responsible for the hotter parts of the cosmic microwave background. 'We have methodically addressed all of these issues and concluded none of them can explain the observations we see,' Nichol told Reuters. 'In the end, the only remaining explanation is dark energy - if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's probably a duck.' Radio telescopes like the huge Square Kilometre Array that will be sited in remote areas in South Africa and Australia, should improve the tricky process of measuring distances in the universe and give more definitive data, he said.""What dark energy could be, theoretically, is another question,"" Nichol said.","British and German team say the fuel believed to be expanding the universe is real .
However, they admit they still have no idea what it consists of ."
"As impressive as the Mars Curiosity’s findings have been, the rover just doesn’t have the brains to cut it further out in the solar system. This is because, at the start of each Martian day, Nasa has to deal with a significant communication delay when it sends its agenda to the Mars rover. Even moving at light speed, instructions from Earth take about 20 minutes to reach the surface of Mars.  This 40-minute roundtrip makes real-time control of the rover impossible. At the start of each Martian day, Nasa has to deal with a significant communication delay when it sends its agenda to the Mars rover. Even moving at light speed, instructions from Earth take about 20 minutes to reach the surface of Mars.  This 40-minute roundtrip makes real-time control of the rover impossible . On Jupiter's moon Europa, where astrobiologists suspect extraterrestrial life could exist, the delay balloons to over 90 minutes. But an ‘intelligent’ camera that can not only take pictures of alien rock, but also analyse them and draw intelligent conclusions about what to do next is hoping to change all that. Named ‘TextureCam’, the two-lens device snaps 3D images and a special processor, separate from the rover's main computer, analyses the pictures. By recognising textures in the photos, the processor distinguishes between sand, rocks and sky. The processor then uses the size and distance to rocks in the picture to determine if any are scientifically important layered rocks.

The . processor then uses the size and distance to rocks in the picture to . determine if any are scientifically important layered rocks.

When TextureCam spots an interesting . rock, it can either upload a high-resolution image back to Earth or send . a message to the main processor to move toward the rock and take a . sample. ‘We currently have a micromanaging approach to space exploration,’ said senior researcher Kiri Wagstaff, a geologist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) California. ‘While this suffices for our rovers on Mars, it works less and less well the further you get from the Earth. ‘If you want to get ambitious and go to Europa and asteroids and comets, you need more and more autonomy to even make that feasible.’ While researchers recently introduced autonomous navigation to the Curiosity rover, its scientific objectives are still determined by the images it transmits back to Earth. Mars-to-Earth communication costs precious power and trickles at a bandwidth of around 0.012 megabits per second—about 250 times slower than a 3G cellphone network. Mars orbiters can help speed up the data transfer rate, though the satellites only orbit into correct alignment a few short minutes each day. Curiosity's constrained connection limits the number of Martian images it can send back to Earth. TextureCam snaps photos of rocks in the Mojave Desert in California. The desert rocks look similar to rocks the automated system might one day need to analyse on Mars or other far-away worlds . ‘If the rover itself could prioritise what's scientifically important, it would suddenly have the capability to take more images than it knows it can send back. ‘That goes hand in hand with its ability to discover new things that weren't anticipated,’ said Ms Wagstaff. In its infancy, Ms Wagstaff and her colleagues trained TextureCam using real Martian images taken by previous rover missions. TextureCam's training worked similarly to the facial unlock feature available on smartphones and computers. The more examples of interesting rocks it was shown, the better it became at identifying the common features that made the rocks scientifically important. Recently TextureCam was successfully run through its paces in the rocky landscape of the Mojave Desert in Southern California—a useful test environment for the Martian surface.","The TextureCam can both take and analyse images of an alien environment .

"The wife of disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner has revealed how unconditional love from her boss Hillary Clinton helped her through her husband's sexting scandal. Huma Abedin, who started working for Clinton when she was 21 and remains a top aide, was pregnant when it emerged in 2011 that her husband had sent lewd pictures to a string of women. But the couple weathered the storm and his resignation, and in a lengthy article in New York Times Magazine, Abedin has explained how the support she received at work helped her get through. 'What I will say about [Hillary], . and for that matter her entire family, the unconditional love and . support they have given me has been a real gift,' she told the Times. Support: Huma Abedin has revealed how her boss Hillary Clinton (pictured together in 2008) helped her through the sexting scandal involving her husband, former congressman Anthony Weiner . 'And I think she would . be O.K. with me saying this, because I know she has said this before: at . the end of the day, at the very least, every woman should have the . ability and the confidence and the choice to make whatever decisions she . wants to make that are right for her and not be judged by it.' The situation echoes Clinton's own personal life and her decision to stick by her husband, and Weiner himself likened his relationship to the Clintons' when the Monica Lewinsky affair came to light. 'If you read Hillary's biography of the time,' he said in the interview, 'she speaks pretty frankly about believing that there were people out to get her husband - ""I believe him, I'm going to stand in there, I'm going to tell friends that it’s bull"" - and the way she felt when she found out the truth.' Abedin, 37, speaks about this rollercoaster of emotions - from when she first heard he was accused of sending pictures to women to when he came clean. Supportive: Huma Abedin, a close aide to Hillary Clinton, said she has forgiven her husband's mistake . At first 'I was right there with him: ""Let’s . fight! Defend!""' she said. 'I was with him. One hundred percent.' But as the intensity of accusations and calls from reporters grew, he decided to come clean to Abedin during a trip to the Hamptons. 'It was . every emotion that one would imagine,' she said. 'Rage and anger and shock. But . more than anything else, in the immediate, it was disbelief. The thing . that I consciously remember saying over and over and over again is: ""I . don't understand. What is going on? What's happening to our lives?""' Two days later, she headed on a week-long trip to Africa on Clinton's plane. While aboard, her phone rang and someone at the White House said: 'We are here for you, and we love you.' When she arrived in Abu Dhabi, Clinton's chief of staff revealed they had also helped fly in her mother and older brother to support her throughout the trip. Sexting: Weiner was forced to step down in June . 2011 after inadvertently sending out a lewd picture of himself on . Twitter. It emerged he was sending the images, left, to numerous women . online including Ginger Lee, right . Return? Former U.S. Congressman Anthony Weiner revealed he is considering running for New York mayor . On returning, Weiner resigned and they focused on their marriage. Abedin said that despite her feelings of betrayal, she loved her husband and the friendship they had shared for many years. 'Here was a man I respected, I loved, was . the father of this child inside of me, and he was asking me for a . second chance,' she remembered. 'It took a long . time to be able to sit on a couch next to Anthony and say, ""O.K., I . understand and I forgive"". It was the right choice for me. I didn't make . it lightly.' The . couple is now working towards the future - bringing up their son Jordan . as Weiner considers entering the New York mayor race this year. By her side: Abedin also received support from the White Houseand Clinton's other aides . He told the magazine that he wants to ask his supporters for a second chance and 'it's now or maybe never'. Weiner said that the results from the polling by Obama's longtime pollster  David Binder showed that he would have a tough time. 'David said I'd be the underdog in any race I ran,' he said. Weiner had been a mayoral frontrunner . before he left his job and still has $4.3 million left in his campaign . account. But . he was forced to step down in June 2011, when he mistakenly posted a . 'crotch shot' on his Twitter feed. It later emerged he had been sending . lewd images to numerous young women. Standing by him: Weiner's wife Huma Abedin was pregnant when his sexting scandal emerged . Support: Weiner said he spent $100,000 on polling to see how people would react to his running for mayor - and whether they could forgive him. Pictured, supporters in Queens in 2011 . The seven-term Democrat initially . claimed both his Twitter and Facebook accounts had been hacked but later . admitted he had sexted six women in an emotionally charged press . conference.

"Two miners have made a lot of people's Valentine's Day more bearable by posting a hilarious video online of  them singing and dancing to a famous Whitney Houston love song. While they can't believe the global attention they have received, 27-year-old Jamie Byers from Perth and 26-year-old Jason Allen from Cairns told Daily Mail Australia they made the video to give people who are away from their loved ones on Valentine's Day a bit of a laugh. The men, who both work on the same site in Pannawonica, Western Australia, which is 1,400km north of Perth, are astounded that their video, in which they lip-sync to Whitney Houston's 'I Wanna Dance With Somebody', has already been viewed over 470,000 times in the last 23 hours. The video comes just weeks after a lip-syncing US cop became a worldwide phenomenon after a video appeared online of him enthusiastically lip-syncing to Taylor Swift's 'Shake it Off'. Scroll down for video . Jamie Byers (right) and Jason Allen (left) have become internet sensations after posting a video online singing and dancing to Whitney Houston's 'I Wanna Dance With Somebody' Jamie, a plumber who is away from his girlfriend Brooke, missing Valentine's Day, said he never thought there would be such a huge reaction to the funny video, entitled 'Valentine's day in the pilbara [sic]'. 'Yeah it's taken off alright' Jamie told Daily Mail Australia. 'We both knew it was funny and we thought we would get a few likes - not to this extent' In the hilarious video, Jamie and Jason lip-sync to each other, fist pump, sway their heads in unison and appear to have synchronised their dance routine. The men dance in perfect harmony to the music while Jason drives the car, getting into the spirit of Valentine's Day with their feel-good video. The men say they created the video to give people who are away from the loved ones on Valentine's Day a bit of a laugh . The men both work on the same site in Pannawonica, Western Australia, which is 1,400km north of Perth, . Jason, who is single, works as a refrigeration mechanic and is based in the town of Pannawonica. Along with Jamie, they both service two mine sites nearby. Jamie said the video was meant to be a joke to get people's minds off being in the mines and away from their loved ones on the 14th of February. 'It was a joke, mainly just to give people who are working away from their love ones a bit of a laugh on Valentine's Day,' he said. Jamie has worked in the mining town for nearly a year while Jason has been there for two years. While the men's video may be a hit worldwide, they're not sure whether or not they'll will be the next  Simon and Garfunkel. Both Jamie and Jason work for two mine sites in Pannawonica, Western Australia . Jamie (right) is a plumber and Jason (left) is a refrigeration mechanic in Pannawonica . 'We can hope but I don't think so, I'm not sure if you can tell but we were only lip syncing.' Jamie posted a similar video to his Facebook page last year on Valentine's Day where he lip-synced to Tina Turner's 'What's Love Got To  Do With It'. However the video did not receive the same attention as his current one. The video bares a striking resemblance to a video which appeared online in September of a Delaware police officer enthusiastically lip-syncing to Taylor Swift's 'Shake it Off'. The video, posted to the Dover Police Department's Facebook page, showed Master Cpl. Jeff Davis in uniform driving a patrol car while lip-syncing to the popular pop song - sassy head rolls and finger-pointing included. The video comes only weeks after a cop in the US became a worldwide phenomenon after a video appeared online showing him lip-syncing to Taylor Swift's 'Shake It Off' The video appeared too perfect and internet-ready for the scene to be spontaneous - but that didn't stop it from racking up more than 500,000 views in a matter of days. Department spokesman Cpt. Mark Hoffman said Saturday that he's gotten calls about the video from media outlets in Australia, England, Germany, and throughout the U.S. It has reached more than 470,000 YouTube views. Hoffman says Davis, a 19-year veteran of the department, is 'the class clown' and loved making the video. He says the 48-year-old father of four knows 'Shake it Off' so well because of his 10-year-old daughter.","Two miners have made a hilarious video lip-syncing to Whitney Houston .

"China has opened the world's longest cross-sea bridge - which stretches five miles further than the distance between Dover and Calais. The Jiaozhou Bay bridge is 26.4 miles long and links China's eastern port city of Qingdao to the offshore island Huangdao. The road bridge, which is 110ft wide and is the longest of its kind, cost nearly £1billion to build. A bridge over misty waters: The immense £1billion structure which is supported by more than 5,000 pillars stretches for 24 miles along China's eastern port city of Qingdao to the offshore island Huangdao . Engineering feat: The vast bridge, the largest cross-ocean bridge in the world, cost £960million and took four years to build . Chinese TV reports said the bridge passed construction appraisals on Monday and it, along with an undersea tunnel, would be opened for traffic today. It took four years to build the bridge, which is supported by more than 5,000 pillars across the bay, and it is almost three miles longer than the previous record-holder - the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway in Louisiana. Lengthy: The bridge stretches into the distance further than the eye can see and right, the first few cars  roll out across the surface . Open road: Drivers pass through the mist as they make some of the first passes over the 110ft wide bridge which is longer than any others of its kind . Flowers: The first vehicle runs into toll station to the applause of staff and passers-by after the bridge opened to traffic today . Musical mileage: A brass band plays on the sides of the road as flags and banners herald in the opening of the bridge . The start of things to come: Two cars edge through the toll gates that will raise revenue to maintain the £1billion bridge . That structure features two bridges running side by side and is 23.87 miles long. The three-way Qingdao Haiwan bridge is 174 times longer than London's Tower Bridge, spanning the River Thames, but cuts only 19 miles off the drive from Qingdao to Huangdao. Two separate groups of workers have been building it from different ends of the structure since 2006. After linking the two ends of the . bridge on December 22, one engineer said: 'The computer models and . calculations are all very well but you can't relax until the two sides . are bolted together. Don't keep me hanging: The suspension beams form an imposing sight as the reach through the clouds and look down upon colourful flags marking the bridge's grand opening . The long road home: The two roads which run alongside each other wind across The Jiaozhou Bay . 'Even a few centimetres out would have been a disaster.' The . engineering feat will only hold the record as the longest sea bridge . for a few years - it will be beaten by another Chinese bridge in the . next decade. Last . December officials announced workers had begun constructing a bridge to . link southern Guangdong province with Hong Kong and Macau. Set to be completed in 2016, officials said the £6.5billion bridge will span nearly 30 miles. It will be designed to cope with earthquakes up to magnitude 8.0, strong typhoons and the impact of a 300,000 tonne vessel. But both structures will still be dwarfed by the longest bridge in the world, also in China. The Danyang-Kunshan Grand Bridge is an astonishing 102 miles in length.

"A pensioner in his 80s left a mother-of-two with a fractured spine after running her over in his mobility scooter before driving off with a smirk on his face. Izzy Bright-Roberts, 34, was sipping coffee outside a cafe at Exeter Quay, Devon, with her two young children and a friend when the elderly man ploughed into the tables and chairs they were sat at. While her friend managed to whisk her children, Dahlia, three months, and Indiana, one, out of harm's way, Ms Bright-Roberts was rammed head on by the vehicle. Ms Bright-Roberts (pictured with her daughter, Dahlia) was left with a fractured coccyx after being run down by a pensioner in a mobility scooter outside Lutzy's Coffee Shop at Exeter Quay, Devon (above) She was pinned beneath the scooter's wheels until the smiling driver reversed and drove off - without even apologizing or checking if she was injured. The mother-of-two was rushed to hospital and was diagnosed with a fractured coccyx, the tailbone at the very base of the spine . She was released after treatment but told to rest and warned she faces six weeks of gruelling pain while the injury heals. Ms Bright-Roberts, a university worker from Devon, has compared the driver to the eponymous character in 2013 film Bad Grandpa - where actor Johnny Knoxville terrorises a community while disguised as a pensioner. The mother-of-two faces weeks of painful recovery and is calling for tougher regulation of mobility scooters . She said: 'I was just sat outside the coffee shop with three friends and my two children. 'This old guy, who looked like he was totally out of control, came smashing through the table and chairs at quite a pace. 'He came from nowhere, hit the table I was sat at and knocked me off my chair and ran over me. 'He smiled blankly with glazed eyes as he was running over me. Neither him, or the woman he was with, apologised. 'They just left - it was like a scene from the film Bad Grandpa. Ms Bright-Roberts said the pensioner who ran her down reminded her of the eponymous character in 2013 film Bad Grandpa, played by Johnny Knoxville (pictured above, left) 'Had I been holding the baby when he ran over me, it could have been a very different story.' Police launched a probe into the incident at Lutzy's Coffee Shop at Exeter Quay but decided the elderly culprit had hit her accidentally. Ms Bright-Roberts is calling for a change in the law so that people who drive mobility scooters must first acquire a license. Under current legislation anyone over the age of 14 can use the vehicles - which can reach speeds of 8mph. Ms Bright-Roberts added: 'I have been left with very painful injuries. He could easily have careered into the river or into a child. 'I think he was out of control and not fit to be driving. He was a menace to himself and to others.' Anyone over the age of 14 can drive a mobility scooter, which can reach a speed of 8mph . Lutzy Dias, the manager of the cafe, said she was shocked that the driver simply drove off. She said: 'I tried to hold the machine to get it off her and eventually he somehow managed to put it in reverse. 'I tried to get the woman he was with to sit down and take a breath so we could assess the situation. 'But the second I turned around they had got up and they went. In my view he was a danger to himself and other people. 'I was in a bit of shock. Fortunately the woman was not holding her baby - I do not even want to think what may have happened if she was. 'They should have had a sense of responsibility and not just left. I know they were in shock as well but they still have a duty to stop and at least make sure she was okay.' Devon and Cornwall Police said: 'We were called to reports of a collision involving a mobility scooter and a member of the public. 'We spoke to the woman involved and it was determined that it was an accident. As a result we decided the matter was closed and there are no on-going inquires.'","Izzy Bright-Roberts, 34, drinking coffee outside a Devon cafe with children .

"Mastermind: Sandeep Singh-Dosanjh spent proceeds on a £1m house and a Rolls Royce . Three VAT fraudsters who cheated the taxpayer out of £39million in just 69 days in the first case of its kind have been jailed for a total of 35 years. Mastermind Sandeep Singh Dosanjh, 30, splashed the proceeds of his carbon trading VAT scam on a Rolls Royce and a £1million home in upmarket Bayswater, west London. Dosanjh and his two friends Ranjot Singh Chahal, 35, and Navdeep Singh Gill, 31, made millions running a series of bogus companies importing high-value carbon credits free of VAT into the UK. EU emission allowances are known as carbon credits and are certificates which can be bought and sold representing the right to emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. They were created as part of national and international attempts to reduce greenhouse gases. The gang exploited UK VAT laws and sold these carbon credits on to legitimate companies, charging VAT which was never paid back to the government. The bogus importing companies were then dissolved and the credits were sold on again . between three further 'buffer' companies – also run by the gang – before . finally being sold on to legitimate companies so the trading chain . appeared legal. The VAT charged by the 'missing trader' was then shared . out between the gang. The trades were made in a matter of minutes via a computer system, and . the stolen VAT was transferred to offshore bank accounts in the United .

Dosanjh, of Kensington, west London, was jailed for 15 years while Gill, of Slough, Berkshire, was sentenced to 11 years and Chahal, of Southall, Middlesex, was locked up for nine years at Southwark Crown Court. All three were convicted of conspiring to cheat the public revenue between September . 2008 and July 2009 after a 14 week trial which ended last week. They were arrested in dawn raids in August 2009. Guilty: Ranjot . Singh Chahal, right, and Navdeep Singh Gill, left, took part in the carbon trading scam which has now sparked a change in the law . The law has now been changed to prevent carbon credit VAT fraud as a direct result of this case. Judge Peter Testar said of Dosanjh: ‘He made a significant profit, enough to buy a £1million house in Gloucester Terrace (Bayswater), and he also made enough to trade in his Bentley to buy a Rolls Royce. ‘The total loss to the public purse was £39million or 41million euros, that was the amount that was lost or stolen. ‘During the 69 days of the trading there was a huge sums of money involved. ‘The total turnover was of 276million euros, of which 41million euros was due in VAT. ‘One invoice alone returned to your company was for 8 million euros. That is more than most people would dream of earning in a lifetime. ‘Dosanjh wanted to be perceived as successful, and had the profile of a respectable businessman, but did allow the mask the slip. Upmarket: A general view of Gloucester Terrace, West London where Dosanjh bought his £1million home with the proceeds of the scam . ‘The point of having buffer companies acts as a protection, but that protection disappears in these different organisations all know each other. ‘Because of the huge amounts of money that was made some deterrent sentences are required.’ Prosecutor Michael Parroy QC described the fraud as a ‘blatant and dishonest cheat on the public purse by a group of people in an organised and systematic fraud on the VAT system’. He said: ‘The prosecution focuses on the activities of these people while they were trading in carbon credits and using UK regulated companies to do so. ‘The system they employed was simple in its basic concept, but the consequences for them and for the public purse were dramatic. Justice: Southwark Crown Court where all three men were convicted of conspiring to cheat the public revenue after a 14 week trial . ‘The loss of tax revenue ran into millions and millions of pounds and those involved made a lot of money - some of them made staggering amounts - and all of it was made cheating the tax payers of this country so that money that money that should have paid for hospital and schools was diverted into the pockets of a group of dishonest people.’ Chris Martin, HMRC Criminal . Investigations, said: 'This was a deliberate attempt to steal as much . money as possible from the public purse by a criminal gang interested . only in lining their own pockets. 'HMRC will not stand by and let . crooks rip off honest taxpayers. The message is clear – if you attempt . to defraud the Exchequer, we will track you down and bring you to . court.' HMRC said confiscation proceedings were underway to ensure that the criminals do not profit from their crimes.","Sandeep Dosanjh spent £1million on a house in upmarket Bayswater, west London .

"The widow of the suspected Boston bomber enjoyed a fast food lunch on Sunday as federal officials once again searched her home to determine whether she had any involvement in the deadly terrorist attacks. Katherine Russell, 24, laughed and chatted with a friend at a branch of the Mexican fast-food chain Chipotle along with her three-year-old daughter. She appeared relaxed and carefree as she ordered at the counter before carrying a soda and bag of food to her car from the restaurant close to her home in Warwick, Rhode Island. The widow was likely trailed by undercover FBI agents in an unmarked car as officials remain suspicious about how much she knows relating to the planning and production of the pressure cooker bombs. The casual outing came as federal investigators revealed that they had discovered radical Islamist materials on a computer belonging to Russell and the fact that she will not reveal what she spoke to her husband about when they had a phone conversation on the night that his photo was released by the FBI. Denials: Katherine Russell (pictured right with an unknown friend holding her daughter) has said through her attorney that she knew nothing of the deadly attacks on Boston . Dining out: The widow of suspected Boston bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev leaves a fast-food restaurant on Sunday in Warwick, Rhode Island . Sunday lunch: Katherine Russell, widow of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, out for lunch with her three-year-old daughter and a friend at Chipotle . Agents were back at her home Sunday, as investigators in hazmat suits looked through her home, CNN reported. They stopped searching in the afternoon and it was not immediately clear if they took anything from the home. Russell has repeatedly claimed through her . attorney that she knew nothing about the deadly April 15 bombings . allegedly set off by her late husband, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, and his . younger brother, Dzhokhar. However, . the discovery of al Qaeda’s Inspire magazine on Russell’s computer, . along with the presence of explosive residue throughout their home, have . raised new questions about Russell's possible involvement in the act of . terror. According to a government document obtained by NBC News, an analysis of the bombs used at the Boston Marathon and pipe bombs that the Tsarnaevs had allegedly thrown at police may have been built following instructions that appeared in an Inspire article titled: Make a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom. Relaxed: Russell is being investigated by the FBI after radical Islamic magazine Inspire was found on her computer and traces of explosive residue at her home . Protected: Katherine Russell's friend shields her young daughter as the widow made the trip for fast-food . Officials have yet to determine whether the Islamist files found in Russell’s possession belonged to the 24-year-old mother, her late 26-year-old husband or a third party, a source told The Washington Post. Tamerlan Tsranaev was shot dead in a gun battle with police four days after the marathon bombings when he and his brother allegedly carjacked a vehicle in a Boston suburb. His younger brother, 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, had fled, setting off a massive manhunt that ended when he was discovered gravely wounded hiding in a boat. Russell's attorney, Amato DeLuca, had previously said his client was kept in the dark about the deadly plot, and she was shocked to learn that her husband and brother-in-law were allegedly responsible for the attacks. Relaxed: Russell appeared in public following the FBI announcement that residue from explosives had been found in her home . Fast-food stop: Russell's daughter was carried by her friend on Sunday as they picked up food from a Chipotle branch on Rhode Island . Meanwhile, CNN reported that . investigators inspecting Russell and Tsranaev's home in Cambridge, . Massachusetts, found traces of explosive residue in the kitchen sink, . the bathtub and on a table. Following . his arrest, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told police that he and his older brother . built the pressure cooker bombs in the basement of the Cambridge . residence. 'Incriminating': Officials say among the materials discovered on Russell's computer was al Qaeda's Inspire magazine . It was . established earlier this week that female DNA found one a piece of an . explosive device used in the attacks did not match Russell's, but rather . belonged to a department store clerk where the siblings had purchased . the pressure cookers. In . another development in the case, federal and state law enforcement . officials accompanied by bomb-sniffing dogs scoured a wooded area near . Dartmouth, Massachusetts, where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev attended college, in . search of new evidence possibly related to the attacks. According to witness accounts, the brothers may have tested explosives in the woods two weeks before the bombings . It was revealed earlier this week that Tamerlan Tsarnaev called his wife in the hours after the FBI released surveillance images of him and his younger brother. But only Russell knows what was said in the conversation, as she has stopped cooperating with authorities over recent days, the New York Times reported. Authorities are skeptical of her . insistence that she played no role in the attack or in helping the . brothers escape the authorities following the release of the . photographs, the Times reported. A source told CNN that the bombs were built in the apartment that Tsarnaev shared with Russell and their three-year-old daughter. Residue samples were found on the kitchen table, the kitchen sink, and the bathtub, the source said. Spokesman Jason Pack confirmed that . agents investigating the Boston bombings visited the North Kingstown . home of Russell's parents, where Tsarnaev's widow has been staying since . the attacks. Probe: Authorities visited her parents' home this week after female DNA was found on one of the bombs . Hiding out: Russell has been staying at her parents' North Kingstown, Rhode Island home, pictured . Her lawyer says Russell denies any . involvement in the bombings, but authorities are still working to . establish what exactly she knew - if anything - before or after the . April 15 attacks. On Wednesday, attorney Amato . DeLuca insisted Russell 'will continue to meet with law enforcement, as . she has done for many hours over the past week, and provide as much . assistance to the investigation as she can' though said cooperation has apparently ended with no explanation. Russell met Tamerlan while she was a student at Suffolk University, according to her lawyer. She converted to Islam and they married in 2010 before having a daughter, now three. Her husband was killed on April 18 following a shoot out with police in Watertown. Investigators say his younger brother hit him with a car as he fled the scene. Suspect: Russell's husband Tamerlan Tsarnaev, pictured in 2010, died after a gun battle with police . Body: A vehicle believed to be carrying Tsarnaev's body backs into an underground garage at the Dyer-Lake Funeral Home in North Attleborough, Massachusetts. His family claimed his body on Thursday . Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was caught the following day as he was found hiding in a boat in a backyard. Russell, who has been living with her . parents in North Kingstown, Rhode Island, learned this week that the medical . examiner was ready to release his body and wanted it released to his family. Department of Public Safety spokesman Terrel Harris said a funeral home . retained by Tsarnaev's family picked up the remains. He . said he had no more information about plans for the body. Tsarnaev's uncle Ruslan Tsarni, of Maryland, said Tuesday night the family would take the body. Changed: Russell, pictured left in high school and right following the bombings, met Tamerlan while she was a college student but dropped out when she fell pregnant. She converted to Islam for him . 'Of course, family members will take possession of the body,' Tsarni said. 'We'll do it. We will do it. A family is a family.' The April 15 bombing, using pressure cookers packed with explosives, . nails, ball bearings and metal shards near the marathon's finish line, . killed three people and injured more than 180 others. Russell's attorneys have previously said she and her family were in shock when . they learned of the allegations against her husband and brother-in-law, . Dzhokhar.","Katherine Russell, 24, took her three-year-old daughter to Chipotle in Warwick, Rhode Island .

"In March of last year, Craig Lewis, 55, was dying from a heart condition that caused build-ups of abnormal proteins, and not even a pacemaker could help save his life. But two doctors from the Texas Heart Institute proposed a revolutionary new solution – install a ‘continuous flow’ device that would allow blood to circulate his body without a pulse. Dr Billy Cohn and Dr Bud Frazier installed the device after removing Mr Lewis’ heart. Within a day, the patient was up and speaking with physicians. Scroll down for video . Heartless: Craig Lewis, 55, was the first man to have a 'continuous flow' pump to replace his entire heart - and now has no pulse . No heart: The device uses blades to circulate blood through the body, replacing the heart . The two doctors had developed the device some time before and had tested it on nearly 50 calves. They removed the animals’ hearts, and by the next day, the calves were doing everything they were the day before – eating, sleeping, and moving – but this time, without a heart pumping blood through their bodies. ‘If you listened to (the cow’s) chest with a stethoscope, you wouldn’t hear a heartbeat,’ Dr Cohn told NPR last June. ‘If you hooked her up to an EKG, she’d be flat-lined.’ Mr Lewis’ amyloidosis was getting worse, and doctors feared he would die soon without necessary efforts. Doctors grimly said he had 12 hours to live. Revolutionary: Drs Billy Cohn, left, and Bud Frazier, right, invented the 'continuous flow' device and successfully installed it in Mr Lewis . Raising your pulse: The device, Dr Cohn says, has a 'moderate amount' of homemade materials in it . So, with the permission of Mr Lewis’ wife Linda, Dr Cohn and Dr Frazier installed the heart in March 2011. 'I listened and it was a hum, which was amazing. He didn’t have a pulse.' -Linda Lewis, wife of first man to receive artificial heart . The device works by supplying a continuous flow of blood through the body, using blades to move it along. Dr Cohn said it contains ‘a moderate amount’ of homemade materials. An incredible short directed by Jeremiah Zagar shows the journey of the world’s first heartless man in stunning detail. His feature length documentary In A Dream was nominated for two Emmy’s in 2010. According to NPR, thousands of patients – including former Vice President Dick Cheney – have similar ventricular assist devices, though it only assists an already beating heart. Process: The incredible medical procedure was documented by Emmy Award-nominated director Jeremiah Zagar . Mr Lewis’ wife was astonished when she tried to listen for his pulse. ‘I listened and it was a hum, which was amazing,’ she told NPR. ‘He didn’t have a pulse.' The Texas Heart Institute said that prior to having the revolutionary new device installed, Mr Lewis was reliant on a dialysis machine, a breathing machine, and an external blood pump. In March of last year, Texas Heart Institute president Dr James T. Willerson called it ‘medical history in the making.’ The first artificial human heart prototype was successfully implanted in 1969 by Dr Denton Cooley. Watch video here: .

It involved sealing a monofin inside high-quality silicone to make it hydro-dynamic and effective in the water. The thousands of fish scales were painstakingly sculpted individually by hand out of clay before they were duplicated in fibreglass and then the final mould was injected with silicone. The whole project cost around £10,000 to complete. Linden said: 'I was introduced to Allan through a friend. He wanted my advice for an underwater music video.

"A flagship project launched by the Prime Minister is under investigation for allegedly misusing funds from taxpayers' money and charity pots to to pay off its directors and settle debts. The beleaguered Big Society Network, which David Cameron launched with huge fanfare in 2010, has already been criticised for its dud projects, which were allegedly only approved because officials were pressured to change the rules. And now the Charity Commission has launched its own probe into payments for 'consultancy' to a Tory donor and allegations huge payouts meant for doing good in the community were siphoned off to pay off creditors. Scroll down for video . Under investigation: The Big Society Network is being probed by the Charity Commission. The Big Society is a favour project of Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured above at an event in 2011 . The payments were allegedly made to two directors of the charity and its chair Martyn Rose, a Conservative Party donor, the Independent reported. The revelations have prompted Labour to call for a separate probe into allegations that charity officials were pressured to favour the Government's 'pet projects'. News of the probe came days after a public spending watchdog issued a separate critical report about how National Lottery and Government funds were handed over to and used by the Big Society Network. Shadow civil society minister Lisa Nandy said she was now asking the Cabinet Secretary to investigate whether 'political pressure' was exerted to secure money for ministers' 'pet projects'. The Big Society Network was launched by David Cameron at 10 Downing Street two months after winning power in 2010, with the aim of encouraging the kind of community work and volunteering. 'Inappropriate': It has been alleged that charity officials were pressured to wave through 'pet projects' But the performance of many of the projects it ran has been heavily criticised and the National Audit Office (NAO) exposed problems with how £2million worth of grants were handed over to it. The NAO said the Big Lottery Fund failed to challenge BSN's 'ambitious' target to recruit a million members a year to one initiative despite meeting the target being crucial to its success. The Your Square Mile Project was given an £830,000 lottery grant but eventually managed to attract just 64 members. The grant was also allowed to be transferred to a new company set up by the BSN chairman and another director, without checking it had the IT skills to make the scheme work, the NAO said. Its report also found that the £300,000 childhood obesity grant was made 'contrary to the Cabinet Office's own guidelines' and even though the SNF did not meet its criteria for funding. The officials were allegedly told to 'go back and change the criteria' The funding was halted after £200,000 had been handed over because of the project's poor performance, and the Cabinet Office did not recoup any of the funds. Calls: Labour MP Lisa Nandy has called for an investigation into the Big Society Network . A Charity Commission spokeswoman confirmed that it was examining the Big Society Network's awarding and use of funds. 'Our case into the Society Network Foundation remains open and on going,' she said. 'We have received a response to questions we had relating to connected party transactions and the use of a grant however this does not fully address our concerns and we are in the process of engaging further with the trustees. 'We are also awaiting copies of documents that explain the grounds on which a grant was given.' Mr Rose, who  contributed more than £54,000 to the 2010 Conservative election campaign, said he did not recall the payment from the Network but said that it was possible that 'one of my companies did work on its behalf'. He said he put £200,000 of his own money into the Big Society Network which he had not got back and defended its operations. 'With hindsight, of course, if we had all known that the projects were not going to work we would have been idiots to do them,' he said. 'In the early stages of social investment some will work and some won't.' In a further blow to the Big Society Network, a former trustee of a grants body claimed it was 'forced' to approve £480,000 of applications from the Big Society Network without asking for a pitch. The sum was given to the Big Society Network by innovation funders Nesta without a competitive pitch. Nesta is now a private charity but was a government body at the time. Former trustee Liam Black said the awards were a 'scandalous waste of money'. Nesta told Civil Society News: 'While the vast majority of Nesta's grants are made following open calls for proposals, we do have the ability to provide grants to projects that fit with our vision and advance our objects outside of open calls for proposals. 'That is what happened with the grants to the Big Society Network. Nesta did not fund any of the projects highlighted in the NAO report.' Ms Nandy said the entire Big Society project 'lies in tatters' and called for an investigation. 'It's bad enough that millions of pounds of public money were squandered, but the connections between these organisations and the Conservative party are deeply concerning,' she said. 'I am writing to Cabinet Secretary Jeremy Heywood to ask him to investigate the process by which the grants in question were given. 'We must know if political pressure was applied to give an organisation with close ties to Ministers special treatment. 'At a time when many charities are fighting to survive, handing out large sums of money to flawed, pet projects is inexcusable.' A Cabinet Office spokesman said: 'The awarding of this grant has been the subject of intensive investigation by Cabinet Office and independently by the NAO. 'Both investigations found no rules were broken and the matter is now closed.'","Big Society Network is under investigation by Charity Commission .

And in 2008, 50,000 supporters turned out to watch the Boss promote Obama's campaign in Columbus, Ohio.

"Refusing to give up: Naked Rambler Stephen Gough, 54, has lost his case in Europe's human rights court . Human rights judges have told Britain's best-known naturist he cannot avoid arrest for walking in the nude. 'Naked Rambler' Stephen Gough has spent more than five years in jails and police cells for refusing to wear clothes - and insisted his treatment by police violated his fundamental rights. The 54-year-old was repeatedly jailed for contempt of court after bringing his naturism into the dock, then was isolated in prison because he was naked there too. He brought his case to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, saying police and prison officers had violated his rights to free expression and a private life. Today the court ruled in favour of the government in both cases, saying that while the case was 'troubling' Mr Gough had 'full knowledge of the consequences' when he set off on his naked treks. It added his behaviour 'goes against the standards of accepted public behaviour in any modern democratic society' and was 'alarming and morally offensive'. Mr Gough, a former marine, has walked naked from John O’Groats to Land’s End and is a well-known campaigner for his right to appear nude in public. But his actions have repeatedly landed him in prison. He spent a total of five years and three months in detention from May 2006 to July 2011, when his arrests for breaching the peace sparked the human rights appeal. Today's ruling, led by Latvian human rights court president Ineta Ziemele, is the culmination of a long legal battle with the authorities by Mr Gough - who has repeatedly refused to back down. Mr Gough today described the judgment as 'a disappointment' but added: 'I have no choice but to continue.' He did win 3,000 Euros (£2,360) in damages for 'distress as a result of the physical conditions of his detention', but this was substantially less than the 195,000 Euros (£154,000) he demanded. Mr Gough - who was in detention almost constantly between 2006 and 2011 - said: 'How can nature expressed in human form be indecent? How can any sane person be offended at seeing the human body?' Cheek: Even in prison, Mr Gough was often segregated because he did not accept guards' offer of clothing . Hard fighter: Mr Gough did win £2,360 in damages, but this was less than the £154,000 he had asked for . The ruling read: 'The applicant’s imprisonment is the consequence of his repeated violation of the criminal law in full knowledge of the consequences. '[This was] through conduct which he knew full well not only goes against the standards of accepted public behaviour in any modern democratic society, but also is liable to be alarming and morally and otherwise offensive to other, unwarned members of the public going about their ordinary business.. The court described Gough’s case as 'troubling' but ruled that 'relevant and sufficient' measures had been taken against him by the police and legal authorities. They were meeting a 'pressing social need in response to repeated anti-social conduct' by Gough, the ruling added. There was no violation of his freedom of expression, the judges ruled, and he was not afforded the right to a 'private life' because his nudity was a public protest. In trouble again: The case was finally sparked by his treatment at Perth Sheriff Court in July 2011 (left) after years of public notoriety, which included walking to Lands End with his girlfriend Melanie Roberts in 2003 . Judges said his behaviour 'goes against the standards of accepted public behaviour in any modern society' They wrote: 'The applicant, by deliberately and consistently appearing naked in very public places such as urban centres, courtrooms and the communal parts of prisons, was intent on making a public statement of his belief in the inoffensive nature of the human body. 'Even though, cumulatively, the penalties imposed on the applicant undoubtedly did entail serious consequences for him, the court cannot find in the circumstances of his case, having regard in particular to his own responsibility for his plight, that the public authorities in Scotland unjustifiably interfered with his exercise of freedom of expression.' On one occasion in 2009 court officials hastily erected a screen around Mr Gough's privates to prevent him being in contempt of court. Two years later he walked out of Perth Prison naked after a jail term, and was approached by police within minutes - but still refused to put on his clothes. He appeared naked once again in court as he pleaded not guilty to breaching the peace - rejecting the sheriff’s warnings that he would be held in contempt again if he did not put some clothes on. The Scottish courts found Gough’s conduct on that occasion was severe enough to cause alarm to ordinary people, threatened serious disturbance to the community, and presented as genuinely alarming in its context to any reasonable person. He was jailed to 330 days for the breach of the peace and 90 days for contempt, together with 237 days unspent from a previous sentence - landing him a total jail term of one year, nine months and 18 days. Mr Gough said today: 'I expected them to take the wider view. They have not. 'Then again, what great endeavour ever succeeded without having to surmount many obstacles that stood in its way? Why should it be any different for me? I have no choice but to continue.' Not saying goodbye: Mr Gough, pictured, has vowed to continue his naked quest despite the ruiling . He added: 'How can nature expressed in human form be indecent? How can any sane person be offended at seeing the human body? 'Intolerance and ignorance go together, in the same way that freedom and truth do. We cannot be intolerant and free. We cannot ignore the truth and expect justice to be the outcome. And an unjust world affects us all, whether we are aware of it or not. 'I was brought up to believe I lived in a country that celebrated eccentricity and difference, not only because it added variety and colour to the otherwise slavish conformity that can feel depressive, constricting and sometimes just downright boring, but that it also indicated a deeper appreciation of how the unorthodox, at its very essence, is how originality and creative energy manifests itself.'","Ex-marine Stephen Gough, 54, has spent more than five years in cells .

"Police in Spain's North African enclave of Ceuta have arrested four men suspected of belonging to a militant Islamist network that may have been planning an attack in Spain. Spain has stepped up security as well as efforts to prevent the radicalisation of young Muslim citizens following attacks in Paris this month in which Islamist gunmen killed 17 people. Confirming the arrests, Spanish Interior Minister Jorge Fernandez Diaz told reporters: 'They are two pairs of brothers, highly radicalised and highly trained.' The two pairs of brothers were arrested in Ceuta (pictured), an autonomous Spanish city which borders Morocco . Diaz said there were 'many parallels' with the two brothers who attacked the Paris office of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo earlier this month, shooting dead 12 people. He did not elaborate. El Mundo newspaper quoted Diaz as saying the four detained brothers were of Moroccan origin but held Spanish nationality. In searches carried out alongside the arrests, police found combat gear and knives, he added. Earlier, the interior ministry released a short statement saying police were investigating whether the four men had been planning an attack in Spain. Authorities in Ceuta, an autonomous Spanish city bordering Morocco, declined to comment. Sources close to the investigation told El Pais newspaper the probe had started two weeks ago when one of the four posted a video on his Facebook page showing him providing military training and urging others to wage jihad. Triumphant: Cherif  and Said Kouachi were pictured chanting 'we have avenged the Prophet Muhammad' moments after the attack on the Charlie Hebdo offices . Cherif (left) and Said Kouachi died in a gun battle with police after having killed 12 people at the Charlie Hebdo magazine offices on January 7 . Spain is among a number of European countries struggling to deter young Muslim citizens from becoming jihadists in Syria or Iraq, fearing they might return to plot attacks on home soil. The Spanish cabinet has said it will put forward a plan to counter radicalisation among Muslim citizens at its weekly meeting next Friday. Spanish and Moroccan police arrested seven people in December in a joint operation to prevent the recruitment of women to go to Syria and Iraq to support Islamic State insurgents there. Last September, Spanish police arrested nine people suspected of belonging to a militant cell linked to Islamic State in Melilla, another Spanish enclave on the northern coast of Africa.","Spanish police in North African enclave of Ceuta have arrested four men .

"A one-way ticket to a barren, hostile landscape, where temperatures can drop as low as -150°C, might not sound like everyone’s dream destination. But as of the application deadline a week ago, more than 200,000 people from 140 different countries have applied to be among the first colonists on Mars. The applicants have agreed to stay on the red planet for the rest of their lives – and be filmed for a reality TV programme, said the company behind the mission, Mars One. Scroll down for video . Endemol, the production company behind Big Brother, has announced that it will document the progress of a group of hopefuls as they compete for a 2025 ticket to the red planet. This illustration shows what the settlement on Mars would look like . The Dutch group wants to launch a supply mission that will land on Mars as soon as October 2016.  A ‘settlement rover’ will then land in 2018. They added that landing systems will be tested eight times before they are used to transport humans – a move that Mars One said will make the trips ‘much safer than moon missions’. From the 200,000 applications, between 24 and 40 candidates will be selected to participate in a seven-year training program that would start in 2015. Current applicants have three more rounds to get through before the final selection. The Dutch-based project wants to launch a supply mission to land on Mars by October 2016. The landing systems will be tested eight times before they are used to transport humans - a move that Mars One said will make the trips 'much safer than moon missions' Mars One will launch several unmanned missions in the next 10 years to prepare the ground for the arrival of the colonists. The Mars lander and rover, illustration pictured, will help scout out ideal locations for the colony . Journey time to Mars, which is approximately 40 million miles away depending on its position in orbit, would be around 200 days. An artist's illustration of the colony is pictured . Mars One says it is not necessary to have military training nor experience in flying aircraft nor even a science degree. Candidates must: . 'Be at least 18 years of age, have a deep sense of purpose, willingness to build and maintain healthy relationships, the capacity for self-reflection and ability to trust. They must be resilient, adaptable, curious, creative and resourceful. Mars One is not seeking specific skill sets such as medical doctors, pilots or geologists. Rather, candidates will receive a minimum of eight years extensive training while employed by Mars One. The second round will include an . interview with Mars One committee members, and candidates advancing to . the third round will compete against one another. The third round will include a series of challenges to prepare candidates for the potential mission and will be broadcast on television and online. The group said it aims to have a human settlement on Mars within a decade. Journey time to Mars, which is approximately 40 million miles away depending on its position in orbit, would be around 200 days. ‘Going to Mars would make me feel like I am a true Star Trek officer,’ said one applicant, Michael Archavian. He said that if selected he would ‘do a lot of exploring, see the sites, and stay up at night to see the dual moons’. VIDEO: Construction steps of the Mars One settlement . But Dr Veronica Bray of the University of Arizona has expressed concerns about the project. ‘Radiation exposure is a concern, especially during the trip,’ she said.  ‘This can lead to increased cancer risk, a lower immune system and possible infertility.’ The colony budget is £4 billion, compared to the £1.8 billion spent on Nasa’s rover Curiosity, the most advanced and biggest robot to ever traverse Mars. Mars One aims to raise money to help fund the project through a long-running, global, reality TV show, which will select the first 24 candidates and follow their training. Viewers would vote for who should be on the first team of four to leave Earth in ten years’ time. By 2033 the colony would reach 20 settlers. Dr Chris Lintoot, from Oxford University, said that while the mission was plausible, the problem would lie in the funding. ‘It’s about having the political will and the financial muscle to make this happen,’ he added. ‘That’s what nobody has been able to solve so far.’ As of the application deadline a week ago, more than 200,000 people from 140 different countries have applied to be among the first colonists on Mars .","Mars One plans to have a human settlement on Mars within a decade .

"Jim Davidson launched into a foul-mouthed rant at Bruce Forsyth, as well as saying Terry Wogan and Paul Daniels looked like silhouettes used in newspapers to illustrate suspected sex offenders . Controversial comic Jim Davidson launched into a foul-mouthed rant at Sir Bruce Forsyth and a string of other celebrities during a performance of his show about his Operation Yewtree arrest. Davidson told his audience that Sir Terry Wogan and magician Paul Daniels reminded him of silhouettes used in newspapers to illustrate suspected paedophiles. The former Generation Game and Big Break host continued his tirade of abuse, saying that veteran television host Bruce Forsyth was 'a f******* old b******' and asked: 'Is he dead yet?' Davidson, 60, began the show by talking about his Operation Yewtree arrest in January last year for alleged historic sex offences against women. He was not charged with any offence because of a lack of evidence. During his new stage show, called No Further Action, he claimed Yewtree detectives had gone 'a bit f******* bonkers' pursuing 'paedophiles and perverts', the Sunday Mirror reported. He then shocked theatre-goers by saying that the silhouettes used in newspapers all 'looked like Terry Wogan to me.' He added: 'I can't bear him so I wanted it to be him. And Paul Daniels as well.' Turning his attention to Sir Bruce, 86, Davidson said: 'I only used to watch Strictly in case he f****** dropped dead. When I took over the Generation Game he never even sent me a card.' Davidson had earlier blasted the Doncaster Dome venue, refusing to use the dressing room and getting ready for the show in his car. Before the performance, he tweeted: 'The dome is a dump it looks derelict. Dirty and awful. What shall i do? 'The show must go on ... Tweeting from dressing room.... My car,' he added. Chris Hone, from Doncaster Dome, said: 'We apologise to any customers who were offended by the disparaging tweets about the venue by the act who performed on Saturday. 'A number of issues were raised by the act with a member of the team, who then did everything in his power to ensure the visiting comedian was happy.'

"North Korea has issued yet another set of apocalyptic threats as the rogue state refuses to back down in the face of war games between the U.S. and South Korea. An official newspaper has quoted a war veteran vowing to 'rain bullets on the enemy' while leader Kim Jong Un urged his troops to 'cut their windpipes'. The 20-something leader has been seen looking increasingly warlike in recent pictures posing next to tanks and guns, prompting speculation he is trying to project a 'hard man' image to shore up his authority ahead of a possible new offensive. Speech: The dictatorial leader told troops to 'cut the windpipes' of their enemies . War? North Korean officials have cancelled a ceasefire agreement made with the South decades ago . Threat: North Korea's Kim Jong Un, pictured here with his troops, has pledged to attack his rivals . Hard man: Over the past couple of days Kim appears to have projected a tougher image . North Korea's army this week officially cancelled an armistice it signed with the South at the end of Korean War. The move makes it more likely that recent tensions, prompted by new UN sanctions as well as the joint military exercises which started yesterday, could bubble over into all-out warfare. Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of Kim's Workers' Party, quoted an 80-year-old veteran of the Korean War supposedly expressed the national mood. 'I am still keeping a bullet that I failed to fire at a trench in the 1950s because the U.S. imperialists and their stooges signed an armistice agreement,' he apparently said. 'Send me to the trench. Give me a rifle. I want to rain bullets on the enemy to my heart's content.' Firepower: Official media have published a series of threats towards South Korea and the West . Looking at a tank: Kim has made a series of visits to elite military installations in recent days . Crowd: Kim receives a rapturous response from an audience of soldiers at a military base . Kim himself issued a direct threat to the U.S. and South Korea over their long-scheduled drills on the Korean Peninsula. 'As . the saying goes, a guy who is fond of playing with fire is bound to . perish in flames,' he told troops. 'All the enemies quite often playing . with fire in the sensitive hotspot should be thrown into a cauldron once . I issue an order. 'Once . an order is issued you should break the waists of the crazy enemies, . totally cut their windpipes and thus clearly show them what a real war . is like.' The leader's . martial attitude in recent photographs is in stark contrast to the . laid-back image he attempted to project during the recent visit of . former basketball star Dennis Rodman to the pariah nation. Pictures from that visit showed him laughing along with his guest at a sports match and hosting the star at a lavish banquet. Inspection: Kim holds up a guitar at the base on an island near the border with South Korea . After the start of the military . drills yesterday, South Korean officials said their northern . counterparts did not answer two calls on a hotline between the sides, . apparently following through on an earlier vow to cut the communication . channel because of the drills. Pyongyang . has launched a bombast-filled propaganda campaign against the drills, . which involve 10,000 South Korean and about 3,000 American troops, and . last week's UN vote to impose new sanctions over the North's February 12 . nuclear test. Pyongyang . isn't believed to be able to build a warhead small enough to mount on a . long-range missile, and the North's military has repeatedly vowed in . the past to scrap the 1953 armistice. North . Korea wants a formal peace treaty, security guarantees and other . concessions, as well as the removal of 28,500 U.S. troops stationed in . South Korea. South Korean and U.S. officials have been closely monitoring Pyongyang's actions and parsing the torrent of recent rhetoric from the North, which has been more warlike than usual. Change of tune: Just two weeks ago Kim was pictured enjoying himself with ex-NBA star Dennis Rodman . North Korea regularly claims South . Korea-U.S. drills are a preparation for invasion, but Pyongyang has . signaled more worry about the drills that began Monday. The drills follow UN sanctions that the North says are the result of U.S. hostility aimed at toppling its political system. North . Korea has also warned South Korea of a nuclear war on the divided . peninsula and said it was cancelling nonaggression pacts. Under . newly inaugurated President Park Geun-hye, South Korea's defence . ministry, which often brushes off North Korean threats, has looked to . send a message of strength in response to the latest threats. The . ministry warned on Friday that the North's government would 'evaporate . from the face of the Earth' if it ever used a nuclear weapon. The White House also said the U.S. is fully capable of defending itself against a North Korean ballistic attack. North Korea has said the U.S. mainland is within the range of its long-range missiles, and an army general told a Pyongyang rally last week that the military is ready to fire a long-range nuclear-armed missile to turn Washington into a 'sea of fire.' Best of friends: Kim at dinner in Pyongyang with Rodman and his wife Ri Sol Ju, left . While outside scientists are still trying to determine specifics, the North's rocket test in December and third atomic bomb test last month may have pushed the country a step closer to acquiring the ability to hit the U.S. with weapons of mass destruction. Analysts, however, say Pyongyang is still years away from acquiring the smaller, lighter nuclear warheads needed for a credible nuclear missile program. But there are still worries about a smaller conflict. North Korea has a variety of missiles and other weapons capable of striking South Korea. In 2010, North Korea shelled a South Korean island and allegedly torpedoed a South Korean warship, killing a total of 50 South Koreans. Both incidents occurred near the disputed western sea boundary, a recurring flashpoint between the Koreas that has seen three other bloody naval skirmishes since 1999. Kim Jong Un visited two islands just north of the sea boundary last week and ordered troops there to open fire immediately if a single enemy shell is fired on North Korean waters. Kim was also quoted as saying his military is fully ready to fight an 'all-out war' and that he will order a 'just, great advance for national unification' if the enemy makes even a slight provocation, according to the North's official Korean Central News Agency.","Official media publish aggressive threat against South Korea and the West .

"Andrew Breitbart, the conservative firebrand and new media pioneer who died suddenly at just 43, had told friends he was poised to take his jihad against the Left deeper into the mainstream media with a regular show on CNN. Last weekend, Breitbart told friends he was in early talks with CNN about a Crossfire-style show in which he would argue from the Right alongside former US House representative Anthony Weiner taking him on from the Left. Such a show could have been a blockbuster. In what was perhaps his finest hour, Breitbart was the man who ended the political career of Weiner by revealing that the married congressman he had sent lewd photographs sent to young women via Twitter. Andrew Breitbart, left, told friends he was in talks with CNN to co-host a show with Anthony Weiner . Articulate, outspoken and - before his fall from grace - a darling of the Left, Weiner was one of the few liberals who might have given Breitbart a run for his money. It would also have been a dramatic move for CNN, which previously brought in disgraced Eliot Spitzer, who resigned as New York governor after his trysts with a high-end prostitute were revealed, for a show that was subsequently dropped. Separately, Breitbart had been asked last Friday by Hollywood screenwriter ans producer Aaron Sorkin about how he might be portrayed in Sorkin's new HBO series The Newsroom, about the inner workings of a cable news network. Aaron Sorkin had also recently spoken to Breitbart about portraying him in Sorkin's new show The Newsroom . Sorkin told me via email: 'I e-mailed . Andrew last Friday because the episode of The Newsroom I'm currently . writing takes place during the week the Anthony Weiner photos were in . the news. 'Andrew and I had struck up a friendly e-mail relationship and so I reached out to ask him if he could give me a timeline of the events from his point of view. I got a quick response -'I'm in' - and we were supposed to meet for coffee at the end of the day today [Thursday].' Sorkin said that the coffee would have been 'about Andrew shedding any new light on the Anthony Weiner incident' and 'we'll likely see shards of Andrew during his various appearances that week' in news footage from that time. Confidants of Breitbart say he had . some reservations about a CNN show but would probably have signed up for . it. He was intrigued by the notion of a show with Weiner, believing it . could be a vehicle for real discussion of ideas. Edie Emery, spokeswoman for CNN, said that CNN had no comment. I . first met Breitbart in 2007, when he was still working in relative . obscurity for the Drudge Report. Engaging and irrepressible, he had a . passion for taking on liberals and delighted in doing so from his native . Los Angeles, which he viewed as the belly of the beast. Working . from the basement of his home in Brentwood, he would post stories on . the Drudge Report that would be read by millions and help shape the . media narrative. In each pretty much each corner of virtually every room . was some kind of Apple device so that he would always be connected to . the world outside. He was . proud that the house was right next to the LA National Cemetery, where . many American troops were buried and military funerals were often held. He told me that his real estate agent had told him the proximity to the . cemetery meant the house was worth less but to him it increased its . value. This reporter last saw I last saw Breitbart this past Saturday in Troy, Michigan when he was appearing at the Americans For Prosperity conference after he had uncharacteristically slept in until 10am . Although he saw the mainstream media as the enemy, he understood it and knew many of its main players. This enabled him to use the media, sometimes from with, as well as oppose it. I remember him telling me that the internet had been invented for him because is provided an outlet for his Attention Deficit Disorder, with which he had been diagnosed. Shortly afterwards, Breitbart burst onto the national scene, leaving Drudge to set up his Big Government websites. Almost overnight, he became a conservative megastar. The next time I saw him in LA was last September, when we met for drinks at Barney's Beanery in Westwood with mutual friends. By this time, one of the weapons he used to fight the Left was Twitter. As he approached, wearing a t-shirt from a Tea Party group he had spoken to, he was walking and tweeting. Although he could come across as an angry figure, particularly when on the defensive on television, the reality was that Breitbart loved life and had an immense capacity for humour and mischief. Adopted by a secular Jewish couple, he had grown up holding conventional political views (his natural father was an Irish musician; he knew who his birth parents were but had no interest in meeting them). Despite his fearlessness, he was also a sensitive soul and a very affectionate husband to Susie and father of four. He gloried in his battles, re-tweeting the vilest things said about him to shame and expose their authors. But he told me that he had wondered about the effect of his public persona when his son had been upset relating how a school friend had said to him: 'My father says that your father is evil'. Breitbart had joked that after the Occupy protests he'd shaved his face and cut his hair shorter . But Breitbart was happy to have made a hundred new friends for every friend he had lost because of his new celebrity as a Right-winger. That night, he recounted how he had received an  agonised - and completely unsolicited - email from a college friend who had explained at great length why he could no longer be his friend. Breitbart laughed at the presumptuousness of the whole thing and how he had replied with two words: 'Oh well.' He also said that night that he had recently gone to the hospital emergency room with a tightness in his chest. When a nurse had 'freaked out' at how high his blood pressure was, he had responded: 'Don't tell me that - you'll make it even higher.' Breitbart had looked overweight and stressed that night. I and the others with us told him he needed to ease up on his insane travel schedule and he talked about trying to exercise more, taking downtime with his family and getting a personal assistant to take charge of his diary. But he always seemed to be on Twitter, on TV, on the phone or on a plane - and sometimes seemingly two or three of these at once. A few months ago, he set up a part-time base on Capitol Hill, spending time in Washington working out of a wonderfully kitsch historic house decorated by a rich Egyptian and right next to the US Supreme Court. I last saw Breitbart on Saturday in Troy, Michigan. He was appearing at the Tea Party-linked Americans For Prosperity conference, where Rick Santorum and Mitt Romney also spoke. That morning, he had uncharacteristically slept in until 10am and there had been a panic about where he was. Tragic death: Breitbart leaves behind a wife and four children . Loving father: Breitbart had suffered heart problems a year earlier . During his speech, however, he was on vintage form, describing Barack Obama as 'the metronome' and his allies as 'the alligators'. He declared proudly: 'I'm out there fighting with the metronome. I'm out there fighting with the alligators.' At another point, he said: 'I'm fighting these people as hard as I can. They're totalitarians.' He urged conservatives to 'stop acting like Leftists' in denouncing those who backed Republican candidates who might not pass this or that purity test and said it was essential to get behind whoever was the nominee. As usual, he was extremely funny, joking about how he had shaved his stubble and cut his hair after Occupy people said that 'I look like a bum'. In describing an anti-Republican media narrative designed to divert attention from unemployment and gas prices by highlighting social issues, he said: 'I have four children. I took care of the thing down there. Contraception's not in the top two billion things in my world.' He branded MSNBC 'race card television' and that if a conservative said 'gymnasium' on television, the response would be: ''Gym' originates in antebellum South Carolina. You're all racist!' The next day, he took a car to Detroit airport with filmmaker Ann McElhinney, another speaker and a close friend. As he got in, he told her: 'I feel awful. I feel really bad.' She put it down to a hangover. In the car, they discussed Aaron Sorkin - on Friday night, he had shown her the email from Sorkin - and the prospect of a CNN with Weiner. Breitbart felt that such a CNN show would rehabilitate Weiner but he wanted to ensure it would be serious and would involve going out and talking to real people as well as back-and-forth in the studio. They talked about Fox News, which Breitbart felt was stuck in the past with too many blonde presenters and outdated formats. One of the journalists he admired most, he said, was Dana Loesch, who worked for him as Big Government and is now also CNN contributor. He described her as a 'warrior princess', effective because she was cool and modern. Breitbart thought that the Left feared people like Loesch most because she was an attractive, engaging, hip person who did not fit the stereotype of dour, fusty conservative. Essentially, the same thing could have been said about him. One of Breibart's central arguments was that conservatives had allowed themselves to be excluded from popular culture - film, television, music, even art. He was a central figure in the largely undercover world of Hollywood conservatism. At the end of his speech in Troy, he said that conservatives would have to endure the race card and the 'fairness' card being played against them in the coming election. 'This is warfare. They're at war with you and the very idea that you're still here shows that the Tea Party mindset is alive and kicking.' Who would have thought that the fiercest and most formidable conservative warrior of all was about to leave the battlefield. To comment on this article click here .

While it is not clear why Natalie decided to throw eggs at the judges, her band mates have insisted that they were not involved. A tweet from the group feed read: . 'Just to clarify…. The other 3 of us were working elsewhere today and . found out when you did.' Disgruntled: Natalie Holt, pictured with Matt LeBlanc has been named as the woman who egged Simon Cowell on stage on Saturday night's Britain's Got Talent final . Quick change of heart: Shortly after the end of the show Natalie apologised for her actions . A spokesman for the show told . MailOnline: 'During tonight’s show an incident took place during the . finale of Richard and Adam’s performance. 'Natalie Holt (age 30) was part . of the backing group for their performance and as a result of her . misguided actions the police were called. However, we have decided to . take no further action at this stage.' Judge Amanda Holden spoke of her anger at the disruption Natalie's appearance on stage caused and she  branded her 'a stupid cow' for the apparent act of protest. Taking the plunge: The musician appeared on the talent show with her band, who deny they were involved in the egging . Ms Holt, smiling again, is pictured here brandishing a sword . Talented: The musician has devoted endless hours to her commitments with the orchestra . Clowning around: Natalie (second from left) is BAFTA-nominated composer who appeared in the closing ceremony of last summer's Olympic Games . Simon had to remove his jacket and was left with yolk on his shirt following the attack, but he didn't seem too fazed. Although the egging occurred in the middle of their performance, Richard and Adam were not put off and . they were later praised for their professional attitude. Simon said he thought the woman was throwing sandwiches and assumed it was part of the performance. He said: 'I thought it was part of the act, I thought they were throwing sandwiches.' Disabled comedian Jack Carroll was the next act to perform on stage and he used the opportunity to make a joke about the situation. He began: 'Can I just say, I was going to run on and throw some eggs, so thanks for ruining that.' Angry: Amanda Holden was less than impressed with the stunt during the final of Britain's Got Talent . Stage invasion: A woman ran up in front of the judges to pelt them with eggs . Smile on her face: The girl beamed as she threw the eggs during Richard and Adam's performance . Natalie appeared on Britain's Got Talent last year with her band Raven Quartet. It seems that Natalie, a . BAFTA-nominated composer, and her band mates didn't have a positive . experience on the talent show last year. Natalie's band mate Rachael Lander . wrote a scathing blog post about the group's experience on the show, . which has since been taken down. In the piece she wrote: 'Honestly, if . you think watching those talent shows is gut wrenching, you should try . being a contestant in one.' Target: Miss Holt picked out Simon Cowell as she wanted to make a point about his dominance of the music industry . It's no yolk: Simon had to remove his jacket after it was hit but he still had some egg on his shirt . Rachael claimed the group were approached by the show and deliberated over whether to audition. She wrote: 'We had to acknowledge the . grim truth, which was that Raven needed a bigger profile to get any . kind of deal, we could get a load more gigs if we played to 15 million . viewers, even if those viewers were of the opinion that a dog with a . hula hoop constituted entertainment gold.' Another extract for the post reads: . 'We were uncomfortable that we were, by entering, complicit with the . exploitation of the vulnerable to be humiliated in front of millions. But we had made ourselves publicity whores, we’d made our bed, we had to . play.' Piers Morgan tweeted: 'My vote goes to the egg-thrower. #BGT.' However the broadcaster read Natalie's last tweet, dated from December, which read: 'Thinking about starting a petition to stop Piers Morgan being sent back over.....,' and soon changed his mind. He wrote: 'If the egg-thrower was @filmmusicholt as Twitter claims, then after seeing her last tweet, I'm withdrawing my vote! #BGT.'

"North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was today rumoured to be expecting his second child after his wife appeared in public in a maternity dress. Speculation mounted after onlookers noticed Ri Sol-ju wearing what appeared to be the same loose-fitting outfit she wore before the birth of their daughter in late 2012. A photograph of her attending a recent sporting event that featured on the front of the state-run Rodong Sinmun newspaper suggests she has also put on weight. Are they expecting? Rumours have grown that Kim Jong-Un's wife Ri Sol-Ju is pregnant again after she was spotted wearing what appeared to be same maternity dress she wore before the birth of their first child (left) during a public event last week (right). These two images were published by a South Korean newspaper . Pictures of Ri apparently wearing the dress last week and during her first pregnancy have also been published on the website of South Korean newspaper The Chosun Ilbo. Observers say Kim Jong-Un, 31, who is believed to . also have a daughter with another woman, will be desperately hoping for a . male heir to continue the family's dictatorship. Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at Tokyo's Waseda University and an authority on North Korean affairs, told The Daily Telegraph: 'There have been rumours that Ri is pregnant again for a few weeks now. 'This . is not really a surprise as Kim needs a son as a successor for the . dynasty that has ruled North Korea since it was founded by his . grandfather, Kim Il-sung. 'It's absolutely impossible that a daughter could take over as leader, so his wife needs to give birth to a son.' Observers say Kim Jong-Un, 31, will be desperately hoping for a male heir to continue the family's dictatorship . Ri, previously the lead singer with Ponchonbo Electronic Ensemble, has been out of the spotlight in recent weeks, like she was during her first pregnancy. In March last year, speculation grew . that she had given birth after photographs seen on North Korean TV . showed her wearing a neatly-fitting two-piece skirt suit in contrast to . the loose-fitting clothing she was seen wearing in the December before. With . no official confirmation, the only other evidence of the birth came in . September when basketball star Dennis Rodman said he held the baby girl . during a visit to the country. Will he give up the smoking? A former playmate revealed over the weekend how Jong-Un is a Hollywood-obsessed playboy who grew up with the lavish excesses of a rock-star childhood .

"Chinese presidents are not usually known for popping into restaurants and picking up some lunch so when Xi Jinping decided to grab a bite to eat it caused a media storm. The leader wandered into the Qing Feng Bun Shop and ordered steamed buns, pig innard soup, and stir-fried vegetables. When it came to paying the £2 bill, the president paid it himself before sitting down at a small table to enjoy his meal. Chinese president Xi Jinping was photographed paying for a steamed bun lunch in Beijing . Xi's visit to the western Beijing restaurant was quickly captured on smartphones and pictures soon started circulating on Sina Weibo, China's version of Twitter. His casual visit is a stark contrast to the way the Communist Party usually presents itself, Foreign Policy reports. The government is known for stage-managed appearances and state-controlled media usually accompany any visits or official business. But on this trip, the president didn't have any media with him and he was accompanied by two men. Today, Xi Jinping did have a more presidential air as he gave the New Year's Eve address on state television . He sat eating his soup as other diners took pictures and asked to be pictured with him. The president seemed to happily pose for pictures and the grainy pictures show him taking his own tray of food and paying for it as the crowds of people watch. He follows in the footsteps of US President Barack Obama who has posed for pictures with Prime Minister David Cameron grilling burgers in the back garden at Downing Street.

"A gang who blew up a bank to empty its cash machine have been jailed for a total of nearly 30 years. The five raiders attached gas canisters around the ATM at a Barclays branch in Sevenoaks, Kent, and detonated them, causing a massive explosion in the middle of the night. The group, who carried out the raid in balaclavas and head torches, then used sledge hammers to smash their way through the front door before police could get to the scene. Raid: The gang, wearing balaclavas and head torches, attached gas cannisters to an ATM in Gravesend, Kent, causing a massive explosion . By the time officers arrived the gang had already escaped with £19,000 after severely damaging the ATM and the bank last November. CCTV footage showed them attaching the canisters and using a hose to detonate them before battering their way in. They then fled the scene in in a BMW 3 Series just 20 minutes later. Lee Spinks, 28, Danny Smith, 30, Gary Smith, 39, Luke Cassidy, 28, and Jason Selwood, 30, were arrested after an operation by the Metropolitan Police's Flying Squad, the specialist unit dedicated to investigate robberies. The gang had also tried to raid an ATM at Barclays in Borough Green, Kent earlier in the month. Staff there noticed the machine had been tampered with and checked CCTV to see two men attaching a hose and a gas canister to the cashpoint. Terrifying: The raiders also used sledgehammers to smash their way through the front door of the bank . Preparation: The group used hoses to detonate the cannisters. The equipment was found outside the bank when police reached the scene . Spinks was arrested on November 11 in connection with the raid and two weeks later, Flying Squad Officers caught Smith and Cassidy as they walked towards the Borough Green bank wearing balaclavas, headtorches and carrying gas canisters. Smith was arrested shortly afterwards while driving the getaway car and Selwood was rounded up later that morning. Detective Inspector Mark Bedford Met’s Flying Squad, said: ‘This was an organised group of criminals who used an elaborate method to steal money from the bank. ‘The Flying Squad worked alongside our Kent colleagues to mount a quick-time proactive operation to identify and arrest them. I am confident that today’s guilty pleas are due to the quality of the evidence built up against them. ‘I would like to thank all the officers involved in this investigation from the MPS and Kent who worked around the clock to bring to a swift conclusion the activities of a dangerous criminal gang.’ Cassidy, of Maidstone, Kent, Danny Smith, of Tonbridge and Selwood, of Tonbridge, Kent, were all jailed for six years. Gary Smith, of Sheerness, Kent was jailed for five years and four months as was Spinks of, Beckenham, Kent. Sentenced: The five men involved in the robbery were jailed for a total of 30 years . Convicted: Jason Selwood, 30, (left) and Luke Cassidy, 28, (middle)  jailed for six years for their part in the raid while Lee Spinks, 28, (right) was given a prison sentence of five years and four months .

"Pot plants are to be judged alongside tomato plants and marijuana brownies will compete for blue ribbons in cake categories at Denver County Fair. Organizers say the marijuana . categories will add a fun twist to the already quirky fair, . which includes a drag queen pageant and contest for dioramas made . with Peeps candy. Despite Colorado relaxing its drug laws, there won't be any marijuana at the fairground. Judging will be done off-site, with photos showing the winning entries. And, in the live joint-rolling contest during the three-day show that opens on August 1, pot will be replaced with oregano. High times: Dana Cain of the Denver County Fair shows off a poster highlighting the pot-themed events . 'We thought it was time for us to take that leap and represent one of the things Denver has going on,' said Tracy Weil, the fair's marketing and creative director. The nine marijuana categories include live plants and clones, plus contests for marijuana-infused brownies and savory foods. Homemade bongs, homemade roach clips, and items made with hemp round out the categories. Judges will look only at plant quality, not the potency or quality of the drugs they produce, and the winners will take home $20 and a blue ribbon. The entries will be shown in a Pot Pavilion, which will be open only to those over 21. Even the photographs of the winning . plants will be on display only to adults. Organizers said they didn't want young competitors in the popular rabbit and goat contests wandering by a pot . display. Twist: The Denver fair prides itself on making traditional events like pie eating contests more hip . Hog the limelight: Visitors to the fair can be entertained by a troupe of performing pigs . 'We have a lot of families and kids at the fair, of course, and we wanted to be respectful of that,' Weil said. Prizes will be given for speedy joint-rolling, though fair organizers insist there won't be any marijuana consumption on-site. Competitors in the live Doritos-eating contest, hosted in the same pavilion, will have to acquire their munchies elsewhere. Other entertainment in the Pot Pavilion will include Grateful Dead karaoke and tie-dye competitions. The Denver Fair, which has been running since 2011, has always tried to bring hip elements to traditional favorites like a Ferris wheel and cotton candy. It has a speed text-messaging contest, a rodeo that uses bikes instead of horses, and a popular hog show starring a troupe of performing pigs. Denver is likely to be the only Colorado fair to feature pot after officials in Routt County voted last year to ban marijuana from its shows. Organizers of the state fair have also shown no interest in adding marijuana competitions.","City plans to celebrate Colorado's relaxed drug laws at annual event .

"The family of an Iranian woman left brain dead after being beaten up by her husband were able to watch her final days and hours from 6,000 miles away, via the internet. The Michigan hospital treating Sanaz Nezami, 27, set up a camera that streamed images of her to the family's laptop computer. Ms Nezami, a vibrant woman who could speak three languages, had wanted to pursue an advanced degree in engineering at Michigan Technological University. Sanaz Nezami, 27, was left brain dead after a brutal beating by her husband in Michigan, but during her final days last month her family got to see her even though they didn't leave Iran . Instead, she was brain dead just a few . weeks after unpacking her bags in a remote area of the Michigan, a . victim of a fatal beating by her new husband, according to police. Nezami's time in Michigan's Upper Peninsula can be marked in days. Her impact, however, will last much longer. The images being sent over the internet allowed the family to build an emotional bond with nurses whose compassion for a stranger from an unfamiliar culture gave great comfort to shocked, grieving relatives a world away. The family's faith in the staff led to consent for an extraordinary donation: Nezami's heart, lungs and other life-saving organs were transplanted to seven people in the U.S., a remarkable gift that occurs in less than one percent of all cases. ‘We wanted God to perform a miracle and bring Sanaz back to life,’ her sister, Sara Nezami, said in a phone interview from Tehran. ‘But this is a miracle. Sanaz gave her life in order to give life.’ Senaz had married Nima Nassiri in August and lived with him temporarily in the Los Angeles area, where he was born and raised. The couple had met online . Senaz's husband Nima Nassiri has been charged with second-degree murder . A nurse who took care of Sanaz Nezami said her brief stay, especially the high-tech way of communicating with family, was ‘eye-opening’ for staff at Marquette General Hospital. ‘The family was willing to trust us to know she wasn't coming back,’ Kim Grutt said. Nezami's arrival in Michigan was part of a personal odyssey that took her from Iran to Turkey to the U.S. in just months. In August, she married Nima Nassiri in Turkey and lived with him temporarily in the Los Angeles area, where he was born and raised. Her sister said the two met over the internet. Nezami, a native of Tehran, had a bachelor's degree in engineering and a master's in French translation. She wanted a doctorate degree in environmental engineering and settled on Michigan Tech in Houghton, about 550 miles northwest of Detroit. The newlyweds drove their Toyota from California and found a rental home in November in Dollar Bay, a small town near campus. Nezami was familiar with cold winters in Iran, but folks in her new community still liked to remind her about what to expect on the Keweenaw Peninsula in northern Michigan's Lake Superior. ‘The bank clerk told her the snow will fall until April,’ her sister said. Nezami . planned to take her first classes after the holidays. Meanwhile, she . stayed in touch with family through email, text message and video. On . Dec. 7, she asked her sister to proofread some English-to-Persian . translation she was doing on the side. ‘I . was shocked,’ Sara Nezami said. ‘Sanaz was a very precise girl, but she . omitted some lines. I asked, “Are you OK?” She told me there was no . problem.’ The next day . Sanaz Nezami was rushed to a hospital with severe head injuries and was . transferred 100 miles to Marquette General. Police believe she was . assaulted by her husband, who has been charged with second-degree . murder. His attorney, David Gemignani, declined to comment. Nezami's heart, lungs and other life-saving organs have since been transplanted to save seven people in the U.S. ‘Her brain was so swollen and so damaged, there was no longer any blood flow,’ explained Gail Brandly, who supervises nurses at Marquette General. There were other problems, too. No one knew anything about Nezami, so Brandly ran her name through Google. Suddenly, the stranger who couldn't speak for herself was coming alive through a resume posted online. Nezami was fluent in French, English and Persian. She volunteered to cook for charities. As a teen, she wrote for youth newspapers and magazines and won first place in a 2001 literature competition with an essay on ‘friendships and the differences between us.’ After about 24 hours, the hospital reached relatives in Iran. Immediate travel to the U.S. was impractical due to visa requirements, so a laptop was set up so the family could see Nezami on life support and talk to nurses and doctors over Yahoo Messenger. ‘It isn't something we've done in the past. It's not every day we're dealing with family members so far-flung,’ said Dave Edwards, spokesman for the hospital. Senaz Nezami was left brain dead just a few weeks after unpacking her bags in a remote area of Michigan, a victim of a fatal beating by her new husband, Nima Nassiri, according to police . In Tehran, relatives drifted in and out of the living room at Nezami's father's home to watch what was unfolding in Michigan. ‘We cried a lot,’ her sister said. ‘We prayed in Persian, Arabic and English. The nurses told us Sanaz had brain damage - her brain was dead.’ At one point, Grutt, the nurse, was asked to stroke Nezami's head and kiss her forehead. ‘They wanted us to do things for Sanaz that they would have done,’ Grutt said. ‘They said, “Let her know we love her. We're here.” I felt completely comfortable.’ Nezami died on Dec. 9, but her critical organs - heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, pancreas and small intestine - could be used by others. With the family's consent, they were removed and transplanted to seven people in five states. No other details were released. Nezami had wanted a doctorate degree in environmental engineering and had settled on Michigan Tech in Houghton, about 550 miles northwest of Detroit . ‘The family was very clear. They want Americans to know Sanaz loved America,’ said Wendy Mardak of UW-Organ and Tissue Donation in Madison, Wis., a regional organ donation agency. Nezami was buried Dec. 18 in Marquette's Park Cemetery. As a light snow fell, the hospital's chaplain, the Rev. Leon Jarvis, read Muslim prayers over the casket while about 20 people, mostly nurses and others who cared for her, watched. Jarvis, an Episcopal priest, said he pledged to Nezami's father that ‘as long as I draw breath and live in this city, your daughter will never be alone.’ ‘I've never seen anyone so quickly adopted by so many,’ Jarvis said. ‘Considering our season right now, this was an incredible gift by Sanaz, but also a gift from the community as well. It's realizing the goodness of humanity and what people can do in a real cynical time.’","Sanaz Nezami, 27, died in December just weeks after arriving in Michigan to pursue an advanced degree in engineering .

"We've heard of the iPotty but now we've got the iBouncy chair - a special seat for babies complete with iPad holder. This Christmas mothers and fathers will be treating their toddlers to the contraption created by Fisher-Price which allows children to watch videos and play with different apps from the comfort of their own bouncy chair. But parents and child development experts have slammed the device with one describing it as an 'embarrassment for humankind'. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Too early: The bouncy chair which comes complete with an iPad holder . The American Academy of Paediatrics recommends no screen time at all for children under the age of two. The main reason is that at a time when babies and toddlers are learning to reach, crawl and walk, screen-based activities can be prioritised over those that encourage them to develop skills as well as language. Some may argue that the recommendation was made in relation to TVs and not tablets. It is thought around 38 per cent of households now allow babies to use these devices - this is up 10 per cent from two years ago. The American Academy of Paediatrics recommends no screen time at all for children under the age of two . The device created by Fisher-Price allows children to watch videos and play with different apps from the comfort of their own bouncy chair . But not everyone is convinced.

Shame on you Fisher-Price. Built for neglect, future learning problems, attachment issues and ADHD. While N Marnell said: 'Please, do humanity a favour and DO NOT buy this! This is an embarrassment for humandkind'. Parents have posted negative reviews about the chair on Amazon where you can buy the seat for $75 . However, there were some positive reviews mainly from parents of children with special needs. Amanda J said: 'Parents of special needs children have been waiting for something like this for years! Great idea for kids with limited seating options that don't cost thousands of dollars.' For $75 the device is described by Fisher-Price as 'Soothing, entertaining and technology all in one great grow-with-me seat for baby!

Why a two-year-old may need to check emails, write memos or just stare at the screen while spending a penny is anyone's guess but the firm who invented it, CTA Digital, said it had brilliant feedback from busy parents. Fisher-Price told The Huffington Post: 'We can understand how, at first glance, it may appear that the screen is always in front of baby with an iPad in place.

"Jamie Oliver's bespoke butchers was forced to close after inspectors found mouse droppings, mouldy carcasses and out-of-date wagyu beef. Barbecoa, next to St Paul's Cathedral in the City of London, shut down for 24 hours when officers gave it the worst possible hygiene rating - branding it 'hazardous'. Mould was found growing on carcasses in the basement chillers and expensive meats including wagyu beef, oxtail, onglet, and Spanish-style pork called lomo de cana. Closed: Jamie Oliver's artisan butchers Barbecoa (right) closed after hygiene inspectors found gone-off meat . Dirty slicers and vacuum packers were also found, as well as a 'heavy presence' of mouse droppings. Old chicken which had been de-boned and vacuum packed was found to be relabelled with a later use-by date. Blasting the conditions, inspectors also noted that there was no safety management in place. The shop supplies meat for Oliver's restaurant upstairs, which he opened in 2010 with American chef Adam Perry Lang. Boasting a quality of meat that is 'second to none', the website touts the artisan butchery beneath as the best in Britain. The butchery behind St Paul's Cathedral in London received the worst possible hygiene rating . High-end: Oliver opened the shop and restaurant upstairs of the same name in 2010 with American chef Adam Perry Lang (right), adding to his empire of six chains.

Barbecoa, which Oliver launched in 2010 with American chef Adam Perry Lang, is 'Britain's first ever barbecue steak house', according to the website. The restaurant menu features beef tartare, crispy pig cheeks, a seven different steak options. To drink, there are £10 New York-style cocktails. Diners can douse their chosen meat with additional blue cheese butter or black truffle gravy. A meal costs around £100. Downstairs, the butchery acts as a shop, offering bespoke cuts of beef, lamb, pork and chicken. However, it is one of just 12 food . outlets of 1,659 in the City of London to receive an 'A hazardous' rating from the Food Standards Agency. A spokesman for the Jamie Oliver Group . claims the details, which emerged from a Freedom of Information request . by The Times, did not make the food 'unfit for consumption', adding that . the butchers closed voluntarily. Addressing the mould on the carcasses, she said: 'The dry ageing of meat on the bone encourages the natural formation of mould and this is common practice in butcheries.' The scandal is the latest of many to plague the celebrity chef's restaurant empire. In May last year, the Portsmouth branch of his successful Jamie's Italian chain was forced to pay £17,000 after pleading guilty to breach of the Food Safety Act. The case came a year after staff were filmed pointing and laughing at dying mice in the Edinburgh branch. Recently, the branch London's Square Mile was berated by hygiene inspectors for poor staff cleanliness and access to washing facilities - scoring a two out of five. Out-of-date food has since been found at a Canary Wharf branch and raw burgers at an Oliver eatery in Leeds. It comes after Jamie Italian's in Portsmouth was fined for breaching the Food Safety Act last year . A spokesman for the Jamie Oliver Group said: 'Following the EHO inspection in January we took the immediate decision to voluntarily close the butchery for several hours in order to urgently address the issues raised. 'We reopened within 24 hours and the EHO noted that the improvements had been made. 'We have since continued to receive very positive feedback from the EHO with regards to all improvements and we are confident that the butchery will achieve a high rating in its next inspection. 'Issues such as this are extremely rare within the JO Restaurant Group and are treated with the upmost severity.

"A recycling firm which was found guilty of corporate manslaughter over the death of an employee through 'inexcusable neglect' has been fined £500,000. Father-of-three Michael Whinfrey was killed in an explosion at the Sterecycle (Rotherham) Limited recycling plant in January 2011, in what police described as a 'completely avoidable incident.' The 42-year-old was working at the waste management company, which is now in administration, as an autoclave operator. He suffered fatal head injuries when the door to one of the  autoclaves - pressure chambers which sterilise equipment - exploded. The force of the blast was so great, it blew a hole in the wall of the factory in Rotherham, South Yorkshire. Michael Whinfrey died in a blast at the Sterecycle recycling plant in Rotherham in January 2011. The company was today found guilty of corporate manslaughter and fined £500,000 . Today, the company was found guilty of corporate manslaughter and ordered to pay the fine at Sheffield Crown Court. Welcoming the verdict and sentence, HSE Inspector Carol Downes said: 'This terrible incident was entirely preventable. 'The clear standards and strict inspection regimes set out in the regulations were totally neglected by the company.' Mr Whinfrey's partner of 28 years, Margaret Crofts, said his death had left a 'huge hole' in her life. She said: 'On January 11 my partner of 28 years Michael Whinfrey went to work never to return. 'Michael, a father to our three children, was a hard working man who loved and cared for all his family and friends. An investigation into the Sterecycle plant, pictured, where Mr Whinfrey worked as an autoclave operator, found the incident was preventable . Mr Whinfrey was killed when the door to a pressure chamber exploded. Pictured, the damage after the blast . 'Since this day, there has been a huge hole in all our lives. 'I have had to cope on a daily basis of not knowing or understanding what actually happened to Michael. 'With this guilty verdict now in, I know that through the negligence and incompetence of Sterecycle the company, Michael, through no fault of his own, was unlawfully killed.' A joint investigation, conducted by South Yorkshire Police and the Health and Safety Executive, found the explosion resulted from the failure of a screw connection to the autoclave locking ring, which secured the door to the machine. The two large autoclaves, or pressure chambers, had refuse placed into them and high temperatures and steam pressure were applied to treat the waste and convert it to a fibrous material that could be used as fertiliser. Another employee sustained serious life-changing injuries in the explosion. Detective Sergeant Rob Platts, who led the investigation for South Yorkshire Police, said:  'I am pleased with the verdict reached today as it recognises the systemic failings of a company who had a duty of care to its employees. 'The company was aware of a longstanding issue with the autoclave doors and made no effort to repair the problem properly, putting the lives of their employees at risk.

'After nearly four long years, Mr Whinfrey's family can finally begin to put this painful ordeal behind them and move forward with their lives. 'They finally have the truth about his death and I hope the verdict reached today brings them some small amount of peace.' The force of the blast at the plant was so big it blew off a factory wall , leaving debris in the street outside . Mr Whinfrey lost his life due to the company's 'inexcusable neglect' and another employee suffered life-changing injuries . HSE Inspector Carol Downes said: 'Sterecycle (Rotherham) Ltd didn't properly understand the risks of, and lacked the competence in, operating steam pressure autoclave systems. 'Modifications were made to the autoclaves without adequately considering the effect on the equipment. 'Safety devices were removed because they slowed production and when breakdowns occurred 'running repairs' were made without ever getting to the root cause of the problems. 'Employees were inadequately trained and felt in genuine fear for their safety at the site. The view was taken that production should be maintained at all costs. 'This lethal combination all came together in January, resulting in the tragic death of Michael Whinfrey and a colleague receiving life-changing injuries. 'Other employees and members of the public were also put at risk. 'This terrible incident was entirely preventable. The clear standards and strict inspection regimes set out in the regulations were totally neglected by the company. Sterecycle's former maintenance manager Kevin Goss, 57, of Sheffield, was found not guilty of perverting the course of justice.","Michael Whinfrey, 42, was killed in a blast at Sterecycle recycling plant .

"Migrants with HIV should not be allowed to enter Britain, Nigel Farage has said. In remarks that will prompt a storm of controversy, the Ukip leader explained that he wanted to control the ‘quality’ of immigration into Britain and suggested this should include the medical condition of incomers. In an interview with Newsweek Europe, published today, Mr Farage said it was wrong that the ‘chances of admission’ of highly qualified engineers from India were limited. ‘Ukip want to control the quantity and quality of people who come,’ he said. Scroll down for video . Nigel Farage said the UK should continue to accept refugees, but said that Ukip would control the 'quality and quantity' of other immigrants, including those with HIV . Referring to convicted killer Arnis Zalkalns, who is suspected of murdering London schoolgirl Alice Gross, he added: ‘It’s simple. That Latvian convicted murderer shouldn’t have been allowed here.’ Asked whether ‘quality’ meant people without a homicide conviction, he answered: ‘Yes. And people who do not have HIV, to be frank. That’s a good start. And people with a skill. That is what Britain should do.’ A patient from overseas suffering from HIV is entitled to lifelong treatment on the NHS. Thanks to a change in policy, an HIV-positive migrant could go and see their GP complaining of something as innocuous as a cold – and end up costing the NHS hundreds of thousands of pounds. This is because in a bid to prevent the spread of the disease, the Coalition in 2012 decided to treat all foreigners with HIV, even if their cases were not emergencies. The NHS now offers expensive £20,000-a-year antiretroviral drugs to all non-British residents in England with the disease, including failed asylum seekers and students on temporary visas. The average lifetime treatment cost for an HIV-positive person runs to hundreds of thousands of pounds. And once here, if a migrant or asylum seeker has HIV or Aids, it is hard to remove them. This is because failed asylum seekers from countries with poor medical systems can claim that sending them back would condemn them to die and so fight removal on the grounds that it would be a breach of their human rights. It is not known how many patients are affected or how much the policy has cost the Health Service in total. But doctors have warned that the cost to the NHS of ‘health tourism’ could be billions of pounds. He went on to say: ‘I have never said that we should not take refugees. We have a proud record of accepting refugees, and that must be continued.’ Nearly 20 Tories backed an unsuccessful amendment to the Government’s Immigration Bill earlier this year – which would have required anyone coming to settle in Britain to prove that they were not HIV positive or carrying Hepatitis B. In 2010, Barack Obama overturned a 20-year-old US travel and immigration ban against people with HIV. Currently around 60 countries bar the entry of HIV-positive people, according to the United Nations. The list includes the Bahamas, the Kingdom of Brunei, Equatorial Guinea, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Papua New Guinea, Qatar, Russia, Singapore, Solomon Islands, Sudan, the UAE and Yemen. Conservative MP Henry Smith said the Ukip leader’s remarks had been designed to generate the maximum amount of publicity. He added: ‘It’s official – Nigel Farage doesn’t care about the long-term future of our country, all he’s interested in is the next publicity stunt. 'With offensive gimmicks like this he’s shown he has no credible plan to tackle the uncontrolled mess that Labour left our immigration system in.’ And Dr Rosemary Gillespie, chief executive at Terrence Higgins Trust, an HIV charity, said: ‘The idea that having HIV should be used as a black mark against someone’s name is ridiculous, and shows an outrageous lack of understanding of the issue.’ She added: ‘It is to the UK’s credit that for more than three decades successive governments, no matter their political stamp, have refused to put in place border controls against people living with HIV. ‘Major international organisations – including the United Nations – agree that such draconian measures would have no impact on the epidemic. 'In bracketing those living with the condition with murderers, and suggesting that there is no place for them in his vision of Britain, Mr Farage has stooped to a new level of ignorance. He should be truly ashamed.’ During the interview, Mr Farage also spoke about Arnis Zalkalns, the Latvian immigrant suspected of killing London schoolgirl Alice Gross, saying 'he shouldn’t have been allowed here' Last year cancer specialist Professor J Meirion Thomas warned that the problem of foreigners travelling to Britain for treatment, then leaving without paying was ‘massive and escalating’. But last night Andrew Percy, a Tory member of the health select committee, said: ‘This is a despicable thing to say, given that we’ve spent decades trying to remove the stigma from this disease. 'To pull out one disease over another is pretty disgusting, and shows how regressive some of UKIP’s concerns can be.’ UKIP leader Nigel Farage will declare today that he wants to be Minister for Europe in a coalition government. His party was confident last night of returning its first MP in a by-election in Clacton, Essex, triggered by the defection of Tory MP Douglas Carswell. Ukip was also on course to take a huge chunk of the Labour vote in another by-election in the northern seat of Heywood and Middleton, following the death of MP Jim Dobbin. Smiles: Mr Farage with Tory defector Douglas Carswell during the by-election in Clacton yesterday . Though Labour was expected to hold the seat, party sources conceded that Ukip was likely to end up winning more than 30 per cent of the vote, more than in any previous by-election. In an interview with Newsweek Europe, Mr Farage suggested Ukip could win enough votes in the general election to be invited to form a coalition. He said: ‘If things go well next spring, I would like to be Minister for Europe. ‘I mean that quite seriously. I would like to be the person who goes to Brussels and says, we want to trade with you. ‘We want reciprocal relationships. But this European Treaty doesn’t work for us, and so we are breaking it.’","Farage said skilled immigrants should have better chance of coming to UK .

"Roy Keane has revealed he profited from the controversial takeover of Manchester United by the Glazer family in 2005. The former United skipper admits in his book The Second Half, that he had shares in the club as part of his contract and that the takeover earned him money. In the latest startling revelation from his book, Keane said: 'From the players’ point of view, it didn’t bother us too much. I had a few shares in the club as part of my contract. So the Glazers coming in was worth a few bob to me.' Former Manchester United skipper Roy Keane claims he profited from the controversial Glazer takeover . Joel, Avram and Bryan Glazer took over Manchester United along with their father Malcolm in 2005 . Co-Chairmen Joel and Avram Glazer at Old Trafford to watch United take on Fulham in 2011 . Keane wrote about the Glazer's 2005 takeover in his new autobiography The Second Half . Malcolm Glazer, who died last May aged 85, took United in to private ownership nine years ago via a highly-leveraged buy-out, plunging the club more than £500million in debt. Many United fans will always blame Glazer for the money his family’s company have drained from Old Trafford over the years to service their enormous debts. Glazer’s aggressive pursuit and purchase of United changed the club forever, leading one group of fans to breakaway to set up non-league outfit FC United while another launched the ‘Green and Gold’ campaign that tried so hard to drive the Americans out four years ago. During the Glazer years, however, United still managed to win five Barclays Premier League titles and one Champions League.

"Dozens of traders face prosecution after five banks were fined £2.6billion yesterday for fixing currency markets. Damning transcripts of City workers bragging about making ‘free money’ and laughing at ‘numpties’ not in on their scam were published by regulators. Calling themselves ‘players’, ‘musketeers’ or members of the ‘A-Team’, the traders congratulate each other on ‘killing it’ with rigged deals. Incredibly, their corrupt activities continued for more than a year after the authorities started dishing out an earlier £4billion in fines for the fixing of Libor interest rates. Punishment: Five of the world's biggest banks, including HSBC, have been fined a total of £2bn for colluding to make money from the foreign exchange market . Shameful: New evidence published by the FCA today reveals the bragging messages sent by bankers online as they rigged deals . The illicit dealing was going on even as the big banks told MPs they had got to grips with past misconduct. Furious politicians insisted the culprits should be jailed. ‘They are lying to make money – it’s fraud and someone should go to jail,’ said LibDem MP John Hemming. Andrea Leadsom, a Tory Treasury minister, said: ‘This is absolutely disgusting, I don’t know if corruption is a strong enough word for it. ‘Every taxpayer will be horrified to see that throughout the period of the financial crisis where they were bailing out the financial system, there was a group of foreign exchange traders and other traders who decided they would rig the system to suit their bonuses.’ Louise Cooper, a leading City commentator, said the traders sounded like ‘sniggering school boys’ and ‘kids let loose in a terribly expensive sweetie shop’. Ross McEwan – chief executive of RBS, one of the banks implicated in the currency scam – said: ‘We had people working at this bank who did not know the difference between right and wrong, or worse, didn’t care about the distinction.’ The state-backed bank is investigating more than 50 current and past traders as well as dozens of supervisors and senior managers. RBS was hit with £400million in fines and HSBC received a £390million penalty. Fines for US giants JPMorgan and Citigroup, and Swiss bank UBS, took the bill to £2.1billion. UK and US regulators are also investigating Barclays, which has refused to accept the terms of settlement. Shocking: One conversation between traders led to a deal that made giant UBS $513,000 and one trader joked about how a colleague bragged about his bonuses . Martin Wheatley, who heads the Financial Conduct Authority, said traders had tried to game the £3trillion-a-day foreign exchange market. ‘Today’s record fines mark the gravity of the failings we found and firms need to take responsibility for putting it right,’ he added. ‘They must make sure their traders do not game the system to boost profits or leave the ethics of their conduct to compliance to worry about.’ FCA chief executive Martin Wheatley . The FCA said it could not say how many individuals were involved in the scam which lasted from January 2008 to October 2013. But it is widely expected to be more extensive than the Libor interest rate scandal, for which a string of banks including Barclays started to be fined in June 2012. In the latest scandal, RBS failed to act despite receiving complaints from clients about foreign exchange trading as far back as 2010. A year later a dealer at the bank questioned the sharing of confidential client information at the bank. More than 30 staff at banks across the world have been suspended. George Osborne said the Government would offer its full support to a Serious Fraud Office investigation, which was launched in July but is now expected to be escalated. Pledging that the money raised from the fines would be used for the ‘wider good’, the Chancellor said: ‘We are absolutely determined to clean up corruption in the City by the few so that financial markets work for everyone and we have a banking system that works for everybody.’ The FCA began its probe a year ago after whistleblowers compared the foreign exchange market to the ‘Wild West’ and described how traders were taking advantage of the lack of rules and regulations. Stevie Loughrey, of the law firm Carter-Ruck, said the FCA’s remediation efforts ‘will not comfort bank customers with significant losses’. UBS, Citibank, HSBC, RBS and JP Morgan were fined £2billion and Barclays will also be fined at a later date . Royal Bank of Scotland was fined a total of £399million including £217million by the FCA and £182million by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). HSBC was fined £389million including £216million from the FCA and £173million from the CFTC. Swiss bank UBS was fined a total of £503million including £234million by the FCA, £182million by the CFTC and £87million by the Swiss regulator FINMA. America's Citibank was hit with penalties of £420million including just under £225.6million from the FCA and £194.6million from the CFTC. JP Morgan Chase was fined £417million including £222million by the UK regulator and £195million from the CFTC. However Barclays, the third British bank expected to be fined, said it was 'in the interests of the company to seek a more general coordinated settlement' with more investigations from other authorities still to come.","RBS, HSBC, JPMorgan Chase, UBS and Citibank fined in UK and U.S.

"The FBI investigated threats of violence made against Malcolm Glazer and his family around the time the late owner of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers was acquiring Manchester United, according to newly released documents. Glazer, a self-made billionaire whose 2005 takeover of the Premier League club was fiercely opposed by fans, died in May at age 85. The FBI released more than 120 pages of partially redacted records, including details on threatening telephone calls and emails, in response to a Freedom of Information Act request from The Associated Press. Documents released by the FBI have revealed they investigated violent threats towards Malcolm Glazer back in 2005 as he was in the process of completing a takeover of Manchester United . Manchester United fans declare their feelings towards Glazer's takeover with a large banner in 2005 . Glazer had already owned the Bucs for a decade when he acquired United in a leveraged buyout valued at roughly $1.4 billion. Fans who opposed foreign ownership decried the move, fearing he would sell off the stadium, raise prices and saddle the club with debt. At the time, some Manchester United supporters burned Glazer's likeness in effigy, urged fans to wear black and wave black flags, and called for a boycott of the club's sponsors. British police had also said they were investigating threats from a militant fan group. On the morning of May 12, 2005, the day Glazer became the majority shareholder, a male caller with a British accent called the Buccaneers headquarters, asked many questions about the Bucs and ended the call by saying he wished Glazer were dead, according to an FBI report on the threat. United fans burn an effigy of the American businessman outside Old Trafford in May 2005 . Glazer died aged 85 in May 2014, leaving his sons in control of the Premier League giants . United fans hold a controversial sign in the air before a Champions League clash with AC Milan in 2005 . Several hours later, a male caller again speaking with a British accent identified himself as a member of the Manchester United Action Group and warned that the Glazer family would be in danger unless Glazer backed down from his takeover bid, the FBI report said. Another call came the following day, with the man saying he was the same person who had called before and asking, 'Do you remember me?' The caller said he knew people who 'were ready to take action against Glazer,' and against another person whose name is redacted. The caller said, 'I am giving you another warning' and set a deadline for Glazer to abandon his takeover bid. The FBI issued subpoenas as part of the investigation. But the records show that the case was closed without prosecution because the authorities could not conclusively identify the source of the threats. Because of the threats, the NFL planned for security representatives for all teams the Buccaneers played that season to have pictures of members of the Glazer family, according to the FBI documents. Within a year of the leveraged buyout, Glazer had two strokes and his children ran the 20-time English champions.","New documents reveal that the FBI looked into threats made against Malcolm Glazer in 2005 .

"When a silent 999 call came through, police were taking no chances. The address was traced and officers were dispatched. With no response to their knocking and ringing of the bell, they battered down the front door and discovered, to their relief and amusement, the unlikely source of the SOS. Kitten that dialled 999: Police traced call, smashed down the door...and found home-alone Bruce who had phoned the emergency number . The call had come from Bruce, a pedigree Singapura kitten, who had been left  indoors while the flat’s occupants were at work, and who had been pursuing his fascination with the house telephone and managed to call the emergency number as he pawed at it. He was found by officers hiding in a wardrobe ‘looking very naughty’. Last night owner James Cocksedge, 33, a sound engineer who lives with fiancée Monica de la Cruz, 36, told how he came home to find an officer waiting in his car outside his flat in north-west London – with the door hanging off its hinges. ‘The first thing he said to me was, “don’t worry the cat is fine”,’ he said, ‘and I knew then that Bruce was involved. Shocked: Owner James Cocksedge, 33, a sound engineer who lives with fiancée Monica de la Cruz, 36, told how he came home to find an officer waiting in his car outside his flat . ‘Since we had the landline installed Bruce always rushes to answer the phone when it rings. He’s also fascinated by the buttons, which he loves to press.’ He added: ‘The police officer then explained they’d received a 999 call from our address. Apparently a neighbour had let the officers in through the main door. She said she hadn’t noticed anything was amiss and that Monica and I were at work. But the police said they couldn’t take any chances. I can only imagine they heard some suspicious scuffling through the door – which would have been Bruce having a spat with our other cat Audrey. But it seems they didn’t want to take any chances.’ Mr Cocksedge says he doesn’t blame the police, who were called from Kentish Town station. Caught: Bruce was found by officers hiding in a wardrobe 'looking very naughty' ‘They were only doing their job,’ he added. ‘They did receive an emergency call from our address. For all they know something  really dangerous was going on in the flat.’ However, it has left him with a bills for several hundred pounds for a new front door. A Metropolitan Police spokesman confirmed officers had been called to Mr Cocksedge’s flat on October 17. ‘A cat is referred to in the closing remarks of the record of police attendance at the address,’ he said. ‘The Metropolitan Police Service takes all abandoned calls made to police seriously.’","James Cocksedge, 33, came home to find police outside his London flat .

"It has been almost 125 years since a cardboard tube was first inserted into a roll of toilet paper. But now engineers at an American company have decided to remove it and replace the tube with – nothing, in an attempt to cut down on waste. Kimberly-Clark Corp. says the simple step could eliminate a large chunk of 17 billion cardboard tubes thrown away each year - enough to fill the Empire State Building twice. Kimberly-Clark Corp. says the simple step of removing the centre tube  in its Scott Naturals bathroom tissue could eliminate a large chunk of 17 billion tubes thrown away each year . Scientists, based in Neenah, Wisconsin, developed the tubeless toilet paper roll for Scott Naturals and it has been test marketed on a limited scale in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. It is now being launched nationwide through Walmart stores. Jared Mackrory, brand manager for Scott, said: 'You just put it on the spindle like regular bath tissue. And when you get to that last sheet, it just rolls off. There's no wasted cardboard tube left behind. 'We know the vast majority of American consumers want to be greener, but they are unwilling to pay extra for it, and they are unwilling to sacrifice quality for it.' Scott Paper Co. was the first bathroom tissue maker to insert a cardboard tube into the roll, back in 1890 . The cost to the company is about the same, according to Kimberly-Clark, with the cost saved by removing the tube offset by the changes in manufacturing. 'If this were easy, other brands would be doing it,' said Mackrory. The tubeless roll will work with any dispenser, but it wobbles slightly as it is unwound, according to manufacturers. 'As a father of very small kids, I actually like because the toilet paper won't fly off the roll quite so quickly if a child runs with it,' said Mackrory. Kimberly-Clark said it will not be eliminating any jobs in its plants by dumping the toilet paper tube. Ken Fischburg president of ToiletPaperWorld.com, agrees that it's a good idea if it keeps the tubes out of landfills and sewage systems as some people flush them down the toilet. He said: 'Those paper tubes hardly ever make it to the recycling collection center, even though they're made from recycled content. 'The only issue is whether the core is big enough to accommodate the multiple types of dispensers. Depending on the dispenser, that could be a problem.' Scott Paper Co. was the first bathroom tissue maker to insert a cardboard tube into the roll, back in 1890. Brothers Clarence and Edward Irvin Scott, from New York, launched the concept of toilet paper on a cardboard roll in 1890. The Scotts' brand became more successful than the medicated wipes used at the time. By the end of the 19th century, more  homes were being built with sit-down flush toilets tied to indoor plumbing systems. And because people required something that could be flushed away with minimal damage, toilet paper adverts boasted that the product was recommended by both doctors and plumbers. In the early 1900s, toilet paper was still being marketed as a medicinal item. But in 1928, Hoberg Paper Company tried a different tactic and  introduced a brand called Charmin. The product was fitted  with a feminine logo that depicted a beautiful woman and this proved to be successful. Currently, the United States spends more than $6billion a year on toilet tissue—more than any other nation in the world. Americans, on average, use 57 squares a day and 50 lbs. a year.","Kimberly-Clark Corp. has removed the cardboard tube from toilet roll .

"England Women avoided the pitfalls that saw them humbled by Germany and almost pinched a draw against the United States in Milton Keynes. Alex Morgan's header midway through the first half handed the US a 1-0 victory in the friendly international, but England had a reply from Jodie Taylor wrongly disallowed for offside as a rare break forward almost proved highly fruitful. Having been bold and picked three strikers against Germany, who inflicted a 3-0 drubbing at Wembley, England boss Mark Sampson reined in the attacking instincts and shored up his midfield against the world's second-ranked side.

In tenacious 21-year-old striker Fran Kirby, handed her fourth cap and named player of the match, England looked to have a special talent who could have a big impact in the World Cup this summer. It was from her 25-yard shot that US goalkeeper Ashley Harris tipped against the bar that England should have had their leveller, with Taylor touching in on the rebound. Replays showed Taylor, who plays in the US for Portland Thorns, was clearly onside when Kirby offloaded her strike. That was one of few highlights in England's display. The United States, two-time former World Cup winners, were worthy victors, controlling the contest and pinning the hosts back in their own half for long stretches.

England fell behind when Morgan stepped off marker Steph Houghton to head home Lauren Holiday's inswinging delivery from the right flank, with goalkeeper Karen Bardsley, born in California to English parents, only able to palm the ball into the roof of the net. Home captain Houghton almost put through her own net just before half-time too, nodding Meghan Klingenberg's cross from the left just a foot wide of Bardsley's left-hand post.

Kirby, the 21-year-old Reading prospect, was seeking just her second strike at this level and found herself crowded out as she looked to penetrate the watertight American defence early in the second half. She might have scored in thrilling fashion in the 56th minute though, only for Harris to touch her drive against the woodwork, and was as frustrated as Taylor when the apparent goal on the follow-up was ruled out. With the England threat later waning, Sampson sent on senior figures Eni Aluko, Fara Williams and Lianne Sanderson for the closing stages, in an effort to pep up the performance.

Lynsi’s beloved father Guy Snyder took on the business . but died of a drug overdose when she was just 17. Can I have fries with that? According to a book on the company Lynsi Torres was teased by schoolmates about her father's work. Last year she bought a $17.4million mansion after becoming In-N-Out president . High-life: The home in Bradbury owned by In-N-Out heiress Lynsi Torres has 7 bedrooms and 16 bathrooms . 'Burger Princess': Lynsi Torres reportedly bought her home from former L.A. Dodgers player Adrian Beltre. It is one of the few stories to emerge about the mystery heiress . His mother Esther then took control until her death in 2006 , leaving Lynsi as the company’s sole heir. With no business training or college degree she was the only . person left to keep the 60-year-old chain in the family - her only training was having worked on the weekends at a branch in Redding as a teenager. The on-going dedication to Harry Snyder's . motto ‘the customer is everything’ is as central to the the firm’s success as . their double-double cheeseburgers, special sauce and unadvertised secret . varieties like the famed 'animal style' . In-N-Out Burger began with one small drive through restaurant in Baldwin Park . Founded by Harry and Esther in 1948, the second branch opened alongside a Californian highway three years later. It was the 70s when the chained boomed - with 18 restaurants opened by 1976 . Rich Snyder, Lynsi's uncle, took over from his father expanding the restaurant further still over the next 20 years . The chain now has more than 280 outlets, the latest opening in North Texas last year . Fans love it for its fresh ingredients - all the burgers are made at the company's base plants and driven out that day . It also has 'secret variations' on its basic menu which can be ordered from staff by those in the know . Famous patrons have reportedly included Bob Hope, David Letterman and Gordon Ramsay . It is was given a further boost appearing in cult classic film The Big Lebowski . It never franchises outlets and its trucks deliver patties every . day to all their stores from its Baldwin Park headquarters and secondary bases . in Dallas and Texas. 'My sense of it, having been there and talked to them, . it is more like a family, and once you're kind of in the door, you don't want . to leave, and of course they don't want you to leave either,' Bob Sandelman, of Sandelman and Assoc told NBC. And so Lynsi, who has half ownership of the company through a . trust and stands to get full ownership at 35, was pushed to the fore - but has . managed at the same time to keep a remarkably low profile. ‘I have no clue about her,’ said Janet Lowder, a Rancho . Palos Verdes, California, restaurant consultant, told Bloomberg. ‘I was even . surprised there was a granddaughter.’ What is known about the young company president is that she's had . a tumultuous personal life. Raised in Shingletown, California, she . attended a private Christian high school and has two half sisters on her mother’s side. According to Stacy Perman's book on the family Lynsi was teased by schoolmates who dubbed her the 'burger princess'. She has been married . three times, first to her child sweetheart Jeremiah Seawell at the age of 17 . who she divorced two years later. Drag-racer: One of the few times the extremely private Lynsi Torres is seen in public is on the track of her beloved drag-racing. In-N-Out sponsor a car and she is often spotted at the track . Success story: In-N-Out now has over 260 restaurants and is reportedly worth over a billion dollars. It started out as one drive through diner in Baldwin Park in 1948 . She remarried in 2006, . this time to Richard Martinez who became a minister and with whom she had twins – a boy and a girl. The couple divorced in 2011 and she married again that year. Her current husband is drag racer Val Torres Jr. who has two . daughters from her previous relationship. One of the rare stories which emerged about Lynsi – now Lynsi . Torres – is her reported purchase of a $17.4million home in Bradbury, California last year. According to Realestalker.com she bought the 7 bedroom, 16 . bathroom, luxury home from former L.A. dodgers player Adrián Beltré. She is a huge fan of her new husband’s sport, a dangerous hobby inherited . from her father, a huge drag racing enthusiast who left his only child a collection of 27 cars. Refusing interviews: On a rare public occasion Lynsi Torres attended the opening of an In N Out Burger in Allen, Texas, pictured in 2011. She said she didn't want to be interviewed but was 'ecstatic' Success story: Lynsi Torres will own all of In-N-Out burger when she is 35. It is the envy of the business world as its profits continue to go up despite the economic downturn. It started from one restaurant, left . She has raced and won herself many times and is a member of the National Hot Road Association. In a rare public comment she spoke to Dragracecentral.com about her love of the sport when launching the company’s sponsorship of a new car last February. ‘I am so excited that In-N-Out Burger is back in drag racing,’ she said. ‘My father had a passion for drag racing and that passion lives in me. Drag racing has played a big role in In-N-Out's history and it is also an important part of my family history.’ She is often seen . watching from the sidelines. She also made a rare appearance at the opening of a North Texas In-N-Out outlet in 2011. But with trademark and fitting shyness she failed to advertise her presence. She told the one local reporter present: 'I'm ecstatic but I don't know if I want to do an interview'.","Lynsi Torres, 30, is president and owner of the West Coast burger chain In-N-Out thought to be worth more than $1billion .

"Dorothy Rodham, mother of Secretary of . State Hillary Rodham Clinton and former President Bill Clinton's . mother-in-law, died Tuesday at age 92 after an illness. Mrs Rodham died shortly after midnight, surrounded by her family at a Washington hospital. The Secretary of State had cancelled a planned trip to London and Istanbul to be at her mother's side. Scroll down for video . Supportive throughout: Dorothy Rodham, seen here with her daughter and granddaughter Chelsea on Chelsea's July 2010 wedding day, has died aged 92 after a brief illness . In a statement, the Clinton family hailed Mrs Rodham as a woman who 'overcame abandonment and hardship as a young girl to become the remarkable woman she was - a warm, generous and strong woman; an intellectual; a woman who told a great joke and always got the joke; an extraordinary friend and, most of all, a loving wife, mother and grandmother.' Dorothy Rodham was a witness to her daughter's political victories and defeats. She avoided the spotlight and rarely gave interviews about herself or her daughter and son-in-law, the former president, the Associated Press reports. 'A warm, generous and strong woman': The family, seen here in 2008, put out a statement remembering the beloved matriarch . A notable exception was her daughter's 2008 bid for the Democratic nomination for president. She appeared with her daughter in primary states, particularly at events focusing on women's issues. Mrs Clinton cited her mother in at least one ad during the campaign, saying that her mother had taught her to stand up for herself and to stand up for those who needed help. As Mrs Clinton battled Barack Obama for the nomination in April 2008, Mrs Rodham joined her daughter and granddaughter at a campaign event at Haverford College, Pennsylvania. Show of love: The former first lady was very protective of her mother, but Mrs Rodham . stepped out on the campaign trail in 2007, left, and 2008, right, when her daughter ran for President . Then 88, Mrs Rodham didn't speak at . the event, but Mrs Clinton noted that her mother lived with her and . 'always has a lot of great ideas about what we need to be doing,' drawing chuckles from the audience. Bill Clinton drew similar chuckles . when, in his 1996 Presidential acceptance speech, he said: 'Everybody . knows there is only one person in the world who can really tell the . truth about a man, and that's his mother-in-law.' During one debate in 2008, Mrs Clinton . said: 'I owe it to my mother, who never got a chance to go to college, . who had a very difficult childhood, but who gave me a belief that I . could do whatever I set my mind.' Happy days: Dorothy with son Hugh, daughter Hillary and husband Hugh in the early 50s . Close knit family: Mrs Rodham held hands with son Hugh Rodham as they walked with then-President Bill Clinton in 1999 on the White House Lawn . When Mrs Clinton ended her campaign . during a speech in June 2008 at Washington's National Building Museum, . her mother watched from off stage and wiped a tear as Mrs Clinton . conceded the nomination to Mr Obama. The following February, Mrs Rodham was on hand as her daughter was sworn in as President Obama's secretary of state. The Secretary of State was due to . attend international conferences on cyber-security and Afghanistan but . rushed to be at her ailing mother's side. Sense of humor: Mrs Rodham, seen here in 2009, is also remembered as 'a woman who told a great joke and always got the joke' Mrs Rodham rarely appeared publicly, so the 2007 presidential campaign was a big change . She was due in London today where she . would appear alongside the UK's foreign secretary, William Hague at . London's Conference on Cyberspace and was due to speak this afternoon. Later this week she was expected at a . conference will take place in Istanbul on Wednesday focusing on creating . a regional strategy for boosting security and economic development in . Afghanistan. Dorothy Howell Rodham was born in Chicago in 1919, the daughter of a city firefighter. In her autobiography, Living History, Mrs Clinton described her mother's childhood as lonely and loveless. The Howells shuttled Dorothy and her younger sister, Isabelle, among relatives and schools. She was eight when her parents . divorced in 1927 and she was sent with her sister to live with their . paternal grandparents in Alhambra, California. She made the 2,000-mile train trip alone with her younger sister. As a schoolgirl she was banished to her bedroom for a year by her grandparents after she was caught trick-or-treating. Her grandmother could be cruel when not ignoring young Dorothy, Mrs Clinton wrote. Rodham left her grandparents' home at 14 when she found room and board as a mother's helper to another family. Mrs Rodham, seen here with her daughter in 1992, has been described as Mrs Clinton 'most enduring influence' After graduating from high school, she . returned to Chicago on her mother's promise of helping to pay for a . college education if she lived with her and her new husband. After that promise was unfulfilled, Rodham supported herself with a job in an office. 'I'm still amazed at how my mother . emerged from her lonely early life as such an affectionate and . levelheaded woman,' Mrs Clinton wrote. She met Hugh E. Rodham, a native of Scranton, Pennsylvania, who had found work in Chicago as a traveling salesman. They courted for several years before marrying in 1942. Besides their daughter, they raised two sons, Hugh and Tony. Dorothy Rodham was a homemaker in the . Chicago suburb of Park Ridge but for years took a variety of college . courses even though she never completed a degree. A Democrat, she was a counter to the conservative Republicanism of her husband, who became a successful businessman. From the family archives: Hillary posed with her beloved mother in 1992 for a family photo in Arkansas, where Mrs Rodham had moved . The Rodhams moved to Little Rock, . Arkansas, in 1987, to be near their daughter and her husband, then the . state's governor, and their granddaughter, Chelsea. Dorothy Rodham's husband died in 1993. A Washington Post profile in 2007 noted that she moved to Washington to . live with her daughter's family after Hillary Clinton's election to the . Senate in 2000. Mrs Rodham was the last surviving parent of Hillary Clinton and Chelsea Clinton's last living grandparent. The nature of her illness was not released. The Clinton family plans a private memorial service. The family statement said any . donations should be made to George Washington Hospital, where Mrs Rodham . 'received excellent care and made terrific friends over many years'; or . to the Heifer Project, her Christmas gift of choice in 2010. Or, the statement said 'to a local . organization that helps neglected and mistreated children, a blight . Dorothy was determined to remedy until her last day because she knew too . well the pain too many children suffer.' Dorothy Howell Rodham was born in Chicago on June 4, 1919 and died shortly after midnight on November 1, 2011 in Washington, D.C., surrounded by her family. Her story was a quintessentially American one, largely because she wrote it herself. She overcame abandonment and hardship as a young girl to become the remarkable woman she was — a warm, generous and strong woman; an intellectual; a woman who told a great joke and always got the joke; an extraordinary friend and, most of all, a loving wife, mother and grandmother.Dorothy is and always will be lovingly remembered by her daughter and son-in-law, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Bill Clinton; her sons and daughters-in-law, Hugh Rodham and Maria Rodham and Tony Rodham and Megan Rodham; her grandchildren, Chelsea Clinton and her husband Marc Mezvinsky, Zachary Rodham, Fiona Rodham and Simon Rodham. She leaves behind many friends from all stages and places in her life, friends from California she met in high school, friends from Little Rock and Washington with whom she explored the world, the people who were first her doctors and then became her friends at George Washington Hospital, to the people she met through her children and grandchildren who became as much her friend as theirs.To honor Dorothy, her family will hold a private celebration of her life for family and friends. In lieu of flowers and in line with what Dorothy would have wanted, the family have asked that any one who would want to do so would make a donation in Dorothy’s memory to George Washington Hospital (http://www.gwhospital.com/Donations) where she received excellent care and made terrific friends over many years; to the Heifer Project (http://www.heifer.org/), her Christmas gift of choice in 2010 and an organization dear to her heart; or to a local organization meaningful to the giver that helps neglected and mistreated children, a blight Dorothy was determined to remedy until her last day because she knew too well the pain too many children suffer. Her family is and will be forever grateful for the gift of Dorothy’s life and for the memories they will treasure forever.","Dorothy was surrounded by her family at her Washington hospital bed .

"England Women will step up World Cup preparations by taking on the United States and France in home friendlies early in the new year. Manager Mark Sampson's side will face the US, who are ranked by FIFA as the world's number one side, on Friday, February 13. They will then play France, fourth in the FIFA rankings and the second strongest team in Europe, on Thursday, April 9. England's Jill Scott dives into a challenge with Germany's Pauline Bremer during the match last month . England were beaten 3-0 by Germany at Wembley, the first time the women's team had played there . The fixtures are considered key stepping stones towards Canada 2015 by Sampson, who said: 'It's great news we can confirm the two matches against USA and France. For the team to improve we need to create as many opportunities as possible to test ourselves against the top-tier nations. 'In USA and France we are without doubt facing some of the best teams in the world, and teams who will have genuine ambitions of winning the World Cup.' Wembley staged England Women's match against second-ranked Germany last month, when the visitors won 3-0 in front of a 45,000-strong crowd, and the Football Association has said venues for the upcoming friendlies will be announced in the coming weeks. The defeat by Germany was watched by almost 50,000 fans at Wembley . Manager Mark Sampson is looking forward to the test of facing two of the World's best teams . England, ranked seventh by FIFA, will learn their World Cup opponents when the Canada 2015 draw takes place in Ottawa on Saturday. Sampson added: 'The Germany match gave us a real marker in terms of where we need to strive to be in the long term. We have a long way to go to reach those levels but the experience of matches against the top players and top teams will allow us to develop the qualities we need to be competitive as we can be in the summer.'","England will play USA, ranked first in the world by FIFA, on February 13 .

"Four members of a Romanian gang who targeted more than 60,000 bank customers in a £16million fraud face jail today. The criminals fitted spy cameras to the sides of bank machines all over Britain so they could take down PIN numbers and used miniature skimming devices to snatch card details. Gang members operated from 'factories' across north London and worked around the clock working out ingenious ways to fleece bank customers. They fitted spy cameras to the side of cash machines, rather than the top panel as favoured by their predecessors, to get a better view of the keypad so they could get the PIN accurately. Facing jail: Florin Ioan Silaghi, 30, Vasile Daniel Pop, 30, Ovidiu Metac, 27 and Adriana Alexandra Turc, 25, (top left to bottom right) ran a gang who targeted more than 60,000 bank customers in a £16million fraud . The gang even designed a skimming device disguised as a cigarette packet to fool unsuspecting bank users. They got away with more than £160,000 - with large sums syphoned off to Italy, Columbia, Romania, and Panama - and had bogus cards with a street value of £16million, detectives say. The fraud ring was eventually smashed in December last year unit by the combined might of the Dedicated Cheque and Plastic Crime Unit (DCPCU) - the police sponsored by the banking industry - and the Romanian National Police. Florin Ioan Silaghi, 30, Vasile Daniel Pop, 30, Ovidiu Metac, 27 and Adriana Alexandra Turc, 25, will be sentenced at the Old Bailey for fraud, money laundering, and possessing false documents. 'This case involves an organised crime group participating in a large scale highly sophisticated and counterfeit bank fraud', said prosecutor Catherine Pattison. 'It's a conspiracy to dishonestly represent they are the authorised users of bank accounts in an attempt to obtain financial gain.' She said 60,559 bank cards had been compromised by the gang, according to computers seized by detectives, including 36,000 in the UK alone. Nearly 1,000 bank accounts had been raided with £161,607 stolen in total before the gang were stopped on December 11 last year. Sophisticated fraud: By placing cameras and skimming equipment on cashpoints they managed to get hold of the details of more than 60,000 bank customers and cloned cards with a value of £16m . Raids on Silaghi and Pop's homes uncovered factories dubbed by police as 'fraudster's utopias' including card skimmers, cards traps, cloned cards and spy cameras. Many of the cards found had the number of the stolen PIN written in black marker pen on the back for easy use by the criminals. Ms Pattison said Silaghi had a laptop containing 930 bank card records which had been downloaded from a skimming device. 'There was what looked like a cigarette packet, but inside it contained an ATM skimming device that was logged into the computer and experts found it worked', she said. At the home Metac shared with his girlfriend Turc, cops found more than 5,000 bank records on a computer, as well as a USB stick with 13 hours of footage from a cash point recording PIN numbers. 'Mr Pop's fingerprints were recovered from the side panel, supporting the contention he was involved in manufacturing these devices', said Ms Pattison. 'He played a crucial role in the conspiracy, throughout the conspiracy - his room was being used like Mr Silaghi's, as a make-shift factory. 'His role was significant, as without him others would have been substantially disadvantaged.' Pop and Turc were between them linked to more than £19,000 of money transfers to and from foreign countries, including a string of transactions to Panama. DI Sarah Ward, who led the investigation for the DCPCU, said: 'We are delighted that with these arrests and convictions we have been able to completely dismantle a criminal organisation that was stealing millions from people's bank accounts. 'The premises we raided really were a fraudster's utopia, with a dizzying array of machines and gadgets designed to commit serious fraud.' Romanian gangs are thought to be behind more than 90 per cent of cashpoint thefts in this country. Bank customers are advised to partially cover the keypad when withdrawing cash. The sentencing hearing continues today with jail sentences for all four expected to be handed down tomorrow morning. Silaghi and Metac, of Kenton Lane, Kenton, northwest London, Turc, of Welldon Crescent, Harrow, northwest London and Pop, of Kenmore Road, Kenton, northwest London, all pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation. Silaghi also admitted possessing criminal property, transferring data, and possessing a false ID document. Metac also admitted possessing criminal property, two counts of possessing an article for use in fraud, and possession of false ID documents. Turc also admitted possessing criminal property, transferring criminal property, and acquiring criminal property. Pop also admitted possession of an article for use in fraud and transferring criminal property.","Fraudsters ran 'factory' where they cloned cards using stolen pin numbers .

"England Women will face France, Colombia and Mexico in the group stage at next year's World Cup in Canada. Manager Mark Sampson's side won all 10 of their qualifying matches and conceded just once in the process, raising expectations that were checked by last month's 3-0 defeat to European champions Germany at Wembley. England have reached the quarter-finals in each of their three previous World Cup appearances, and have ambitions of improving on those showings. England women's team have learned their draw for the 2015 World Cup in Canada . England's Jane Moore (centre) in action during a World Cup qualifier against Ukraine .

From the six groups, 16 teams will advance to the knock-out stage. The tournament runs from June 6 to July 5. England's opener will be against France in Moncton, New Brunswick, on June 9. The teams are also due to play each other in a friendly in England on April 9, at a venue still to be announced. Manager Mark Sampson has guided his side to the finals after winning all 10 qualifying games . England, ranked seventh by FIFA, will then face Mexico, also in Moncton, on June 13, before tackling Colombia at the Olympic Stadium in Montreal four days later. Controversy has been sparked by FIFA allowing the tournament to be played on artificial turf, with a group of over 50 players, including United States star forward Abby Wambach, filing a legal complaint against the decision, citing gender discrimination. They have challenged the move under Ontario's Human Rights Code, but on the eve of the draw FIFA general secretary Jerome Valcke called it ""a nonsense"" and ""completely crazy"" to suggest discrimination was an accusation that could be levelled at the world governing body. Defending champions Japan will be hoping to retain their title on artificial turf in Canada .

"In front of a record 45,619-strong crowd at Wembley, this was supposed to be a new dawn for England’s Women as they came up against the second-best side in the world. But ultimately their performance bore too much of a resemblance to their male counterparts: promising, but eventually leaving supporters wishing England could be as good as Germany. Celia Sasic’s first-half brace and Alex Scott’s own goal condemned the home side to defeat on their first appearance at the national stadium, but they look to have won over a new generation of supporters, matching Germany all over the pitch, if not on the scoreline. Eniola Aluko is crowded out by three Germans as England struggled against the world's second best side .

Subs not used: Benkarth, Weib, Kamper, Schmidt, Bremer, Hendrich, Petermann, Dabritz. Scorers: Scott og 6, Sasic 11, 45. ‘The attitude’s there, the character’s there, the spirit’s there,’ head coach Mark Sampson said. ‘3-0 down at half-time, it’s difficult to come out for the second half and do anything but hang on but the team wanted to keep going forward and I thought we did that well. ‘If you want to be competitive at major tournaments you’re going to have to find a way to beat teams like Germany. The lessons we’ll learn today are big going forward. They punished us when we lost a bit of tactical discipline off the ball.’ Captain Steph Houghton felt England matched the team she sees as the best in the world for long periods. ‘We’ve got to give credit to the Germans. They’re a world-class team, better than us and we’ve just got to take that on the chin,’ she said. ‘We’ve got seven months to go until the World Cup and we’ve got to go and try to improve as a team. There’s tactical and technical bits that we can learn as a team but we need to just make sure we need to keep working hard for each other as we can. Demi Stokes holds off Melanie Leupolz as England showed plenty of fight against their talented opponents . Jordan Nobbs had England's best chance, hitting the bar after just a few seconds of the game . ‘Overall when we reflect on this in a few days’ time when the emotions have calmed down we will realise that maybe the game wasn’t as bad as we thought it was and second half especially we can be really proud of ourselves.’ Arsenal midfielder Jordan Nobbs came closest for the Lionesses, rattling the bar from 25 yards out inside the opening eight seconds – but then Germany took over. Melanie Behringer’s delivery was met at the near post by Scott, under pressure from Simone Laudehr, and the ball dropped into the far corner to put the visitors ahead after six minutes – greeted by booing from the Wembley crowd. And five minutes later Sasic doubled the lead, breaking from her own half to confidently slot the ball under the onrushing Bardsley. Over 45,000 fans turned out to watch England in the women's team's first ever game at the new Wembley . A disappointed England team acknowledge the bumper crowd after a tough game against the Germans . England recollected themselves and thought they had pulled one back with Nobbs’s looping header caught by the keeper, but goalline technology showed the ball had not crossed the line. No Lampard-esque controversy here. And Bundesliga top scorer Sasic put the visitors out of sight on the stroke of half-time, nodding in her second from Tabea Kemme’s cross. Substitutes Fran Kirby and Jill Scott went close after the break but by that time Germany knew the job was as good as done. While England recorded 10 wins from 10 in World Cup qualifying, this acted as a reminder that they need to improve to beat the best with seven months to go until Canada 2015.","England battle hard but lose to Germany in front of 45,000 at Wembley .

Carney, at the age of 27, has already played five major summer tournaments for England, going closest to silverware in 2009 when after knock-out wins over hosts Finland and Holland the team bossed by Hope Powell were overwhelmed 6-2 by Germany in the European Championship final. Germany, who retained their European title last year, again pose the opposition in Sunday's friendly. The world's second-ranked side, a sliver behind the United States by FIFA's reckoning, present England with their toughest challenge of manager Sampson's reign, which began in December. Carney portrays the current squad as credible challengers to the world's elite. 'I think it's a more rounded team,' she said, 'and it's in a stronger position mentally and physically. 'If I get out there on the pitch it will be a special moment for me personally but I just think it'll be a special moment for the team - to be the first England women's team to play at Wembley.' Carney has appeared at an array of primarily Football League grounds in home England matches, with Wembley out of reach until the Football Association proposed this weekend's showcase. Targeting an attendance of 30,000, the FA reluctantly halted ticket sales once they soared to 55,000 a fortnight ago, mindful nearby London Underground line closures could cause travel chaos.

Carney would relish more Wembley outings, having tasted the atmosphere when playing for Great Britain in the victory over Brazil at the London Olympics, before over 70,000 fans. But as she recognises: 'That's something we can't control. I've had a great 99 games at other venues. Hopefully there's plenty more times that we can play at Wembley and this won't be the last.' Carney made her international debut as a 17-year-old, coming off the bench and scoring in a 4-1 win over Italy at the National Hockey Stadium in Milton Keynes in February 2005. 'I remember it vividly,' she said, 'from the warm-up to the moment I went on, to the song that was playing when I was warming up at half-time - Run DMC's It's Like That.' Tricksy prompting behind England's strikers has seen Sampson label Carney an 'incredible football talent, in my eyes one of the best in the world'. As Carney puts it: 'He seems to have got the best out of me, and that breeds confidence - something I've lacked in the past. 'He's given me the belief to go on the pitch and express myself and play to my strengths, and not to be too worried about weaknesses - literally just to go and have fun. I've loved every moment I've played under him.' Carney (left) in action against Italy on her England debut in Milton Keynes in 2005 at the age of 17 . The desperate denouement of Powell's 15-year reign in Sweden last year may have been a necessary nadir. 'Everyone has to go through a transition period,' Carney said. 'Hopefully we've gone through ours and come out of it stronger. 'We'll give it our best shot against Germany and if we get the right result that's fantastic, and if not we've got six months to get it right for the World Cup.'","Karen Carney will play her 100th England game on Sunday at Wembley .

"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry were joined by world's fastest man Usain Bolt as they visited athletes competing in the Commonwealth Games on Tuesday. The Royal trio and the Jamaican sprint star chatted and posed for photographs in the athletes' village in Glasgow as hundreds of people gathered to catch a glimpse of the visitors. William, Kate and Harry also played ball games with school children after meeting some of the host nation's medal winners at Team Scotland's accommodation. Scroll down for video . Three tins: Kate listened as one of the children explained the rules of a game which includes knocking down three tins with a ball before running in to the middle of the square, rebuilding them and hopping over the tins three times.

They were then given a tour of the recreation facilities for the athletes, where William played video games with some of the Welsh women's hockey team. All three moved on to the village green where they heard a performance of the Games' anthem for Unicef from a group of local school children. They then joined in the ball games traditionally played in countries from across the Commonwealth. Kate listened as one of the children explained the rules of a game which includes knocking down three tins with a ball before running in to the middle of the square, rebuilding them and hopping over the tins three times. She cheered as she knocked the tins over and looked up and smiled after completing the task in her high wedges. The brothers later faced each other in opposing teams as they played the same game. Earlier in the day, Kate had turned heads as she took her seat alongside William, Harry and track legend Sebastian Coe to watch the athletics in the city's Hampden Park stadium.

She . said: 'Prince Harry set me up for it and gave me a high 10. I said to . Prince William 'hard lines, better luck next time' and he found that . quite funny.' Of the royals' footy skills, she added: 'They were saying they were rubbish but they're not too bad.' Nathan Bawuah, 21, a judo coach who recently completed the programme in London, sparred with Prince Harry and drew 2-2. He . said: 'He was very nimble, which I didn't expect. He made me sweat so . much. They were really down to earth which was really surprising.' Friendly: It was Prince Harry's second day at the Games and he was pictured with the Australian and England women's hockey teams during a visit on Monday .

"CELEBRITY SUFFERER: American socialite Kim Kardashian . A . ground-breaking tablet that treats psoriasis could mean an end to the . debilitating pain and embarrassment suffered by thousands of Britons who . have the disfiguring skin condition. After promising results in . clinical trials in America, the NHS is now considering the use of . Apremilast in the UK and doctors have welcomed the move. 'This is a . huge step forward in  potentially treating a much greater  proportion of . people suffering from psoriasis,' says Dr Richard Warren, consultant . dermatologist at Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust and The University . of Manchester. 'Many patients are worried about  the serious side . effects associated with existing therapies, and trials suggest this is a . very safe drug that will require minimal monitoring.' Psoriasis is a . common condition in which the immune system produces skin cells too . quickly, leading to a  build-up of scaly pink patches on the elbows, . knees and hands, though they can appear anywhere on the body. About . three per cent of the UK population suffers, affecting up to 1.8 million . people. One in 100 suffers an extreme form of the condition that may . require hospitalisation. Celebrity sufferers include socialite Kim . Kardashian and singer Art Garfunkel. Psoriasis can appear at any age . but usually first develops in adults under 40. A third of psoriasis . sufferers go on to develop tenderness, pain and swelling in the joints . and connective tissue, a condition known as psoriatic arthritis. Psoriasis . varies greatly in severity. While some patients suffer only minor . irritation, for others it dramatically reduces quality of life. Depression and low self-esteem are common and psoriasis on the hands or . feet can make many everyday tasks difficult, while psoriatic arthritis . can cause disability. First-line treatment is usually moisturisers, . shampoos and coal-tar preparations while more intense therapies include . steroid drugs, which can have wide-ranging and unpleasant side effects . if used long-term. Ultra-violet light - similar to a sunbed - has . proved effective in a  percentage of patients, though the benefits last . only about six weeks before another course  is needed. Current . treatments for psoriatic arthritis involve injectable drugs that inhibit . tumour necrosis factor (TNF), the substance that triggers the . inflammation  to occur, but carry serious side effects such as nausea, . infections and liver problems. The new treatment works by inhibiting . phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4), an enzyme in immune system cells, causing . an anti-inflammatory effect. Clinical trials of 1,500 adults with . active psoriatic arthritis by US drugs company Celgene have shown . Apremilast to be safe and effective, significantly reducing inflammation . and joint pain and swelling compared to a placebo. Few patients (up to two per cent) showed adverse reactions - such as diarrhoea, nausea, weight loss and headache. First-line treatment is usually moisturisers, shampoos and coal-tar preparations . Studies . on psoriasis patients have found that a third experienced a 75 per cent . improvement in skin problems. Kristian Reich of the SCIderm Research . Institute and Dermatologikum in Hamburg, who carried out the study, said . of the drug: 'I see this as a prime candidate for future management of . psoriasis that allows us to treat a range of patients, including more . moderate cases earlier on.' First marketed as Otezla, it was approved . in March for use in America and it is hoped the drug will become . available in Europe later this year. The National Institute for . Health and Care Excellence (NICE) is appraising its use for psoriatic . arthritis, with hopes  that it will eventually also be available for . general psoriasis. One patient keen to try the drug is Robert Hoyle, . 53, an ex-serviceman from Bradford who now works in a warehouse and . fears his condition will progress into psoriatic arthritis. He suffered . minor symptoms in his late 30s but dismissed them as sweat rashes for . years, until psoriasis was eventually diagnosed. His current . treatment is Diprosalic, a thick Vaseline-like substance which he finds . doesn't  rub in easily and has never fully cleared up his skin. 'If . the new drug is as effective as other treatments I've tried  but without . the side effects, I'd happily try it, as would many others I know,' says Robert, who has had to take several months off work over the past . seven years due to the condition. 'The ointments can be messy, . uncomfortable, and time-consuming. A pill that gives relief from the . scaly skin and constant itching would transform my life.'","3% of UK population suffers from psoriasis, affecting up to 1.8 million people .

"With paint peeling from the walls and doors left to rot, these eerie photographs provide a fascinating insight inside an abandoned mental hospital. St John's Asylum in Lincolnshire was known for its electric shock treatment - and rife with stories about inmates committing suicide in their padded cells. These pictures were captured by student Jonathon Tattersall, 22, after he visited the now-derelict hospital to get a closer look of what remained inside. Scroll down for video . Eerie: St John's Asylum in Lincolnshire was known for its electric shock treatment - and was rife with stories about inmates committing suicide in their padded cells . Spooky beauty: These pictures were captured by student Jonathon Tattersall after he visited the now-derelict hospital to get a closer look of what remained inside . Left behind: Built in 1852, the grounds of St John's included a burial site for those patients who never made it out of their incarceration . Fascinating: Mr Tattersall, who meticulously photographed the site, said the spaces left behind at St John's are 'huge, amazing and unique' Permanently closed: The complex of buildings were known by the final name of St John's Hospital until 1990. But the centre - made even more unsettling now with its peeling paint - was very much an asylum . Impressive sight: People are 'amazed by what's behind the closed doors of buildings they walk past daily', said Mr Tattersall . Falling apart: The series of buildings were erected more than 150 years ago, and has been derelict for almost a quarter of a century . From the outside: The hospital sits in 120 acres of gardens and farmland. It sounds idyllic but - for its residents - the truth was often a lot more painful . He said: ‘A once busy hospital has now . fallen silent and empty. The spaces that are left behind are huge, . amazing and unique - hidden away. ‘Every . derelict place I visit has its own uniqueness and atmosphere which you . can sense when walking around. I try to give off that feeling in my . images. ‘The people I show are amazed by what's behind the closed doors of buildings they walk past daily whilst on their travels.’ Built in 1852, the grounds of St John's Asylum had their own burial site for those who never escaped from the building. Mr Tattersall added: ‘I also like to try and convey the sadness of the stunning architecture left to ruin. If walls could talk: Administration of the hospital passed to the NHS in 1948 and, by the early 1960s, the name 'asylum' had been sanitised from its title. But there is a haunting sense of history when visiting the site . Overgrown: Mr Tattersall captured some extraordinary photographs, saying that the 'once-busy hospital has now fallen silent and empty' Butterflies and flowers: With paint peeling from the walls and doors left to rot, this photograph provides a poignant image of at least a superficial attempt to brighten patients' days . Open doors: Mr Tattersall said he attempts in his work to 'convey the sadness of the stunning architecture left to ruin' Beyond redemption: The St John's sight is now a sorry sight, and there are now firm plans to bring the buildings back to their former glory . Unique architecture: Even though the buildings are in a sad state of disrepair, Tattersall said they were still more impressive than the 'bland and horrible modern architecture appearing in towns and cities' Escape... but no escape: Fire exit doors, in various states of decay, would have provided patients with a temporary respite from the asylum - and only in an emergency . Metaphor: The soothing floral-pattern wallpaper in this room has peeled away to reveal the impenetrable brick wall behind . ‘This is especially important to capture as nowadays you have bland and horrible modern architecture appearing in towns and cities. ‘The buildings built in the previous century are a thing of the past.’ The hospital has been derelict since 1990 and was set in grounds of 120 acres of gardens and farmland. Administration of the hospital passed to the NHS in 1948 and by the early 1960s it was known by its final name of St John's Hospital. A plan to transform the hospital into more than 200 homes was approved by the local council in North Kesteven in April. Property development firm Mabec hopes to turn the Grade II-listed building into 64 houses and 42 apartments, according to reports. A large number of asylums were built across Britain in the second half of 19th century to house the mentally ill in Victorian society. Doctors believed that mental health issues were primarily a physical disorder of the brain - and therefore needed physical treatment. One of their treatments at that time involved giving the patient a shock from a Leydan jar - a device for storing electric charge. Another method was said to have been insulating the patient, electrifying them and then drawing sparks from the affected part. One doctor from the Sussex Asylum wrote in 1873 of a 26-year-old female patient with melancholia who 'endeavoured in every way to destroy herself'. According to an article in the British Journal of Psychiatry in 1988, Dr Newth said: 'Electricity was applied 26 times, positive pole to bead, negative to band. At first, she could only bear a very few cells, six or eight, and it seemed to make her head ache - however, she was afterwards able to bear more. He added that the results were ‘very satisfactory’, saying that she was ‘much brighter, converses rationally' and 'has no desire for self-destruction’.","St John's Asylum in Lincolnshire - which has been derelict since 1990 - was known for its electric shock treatment .

"Tesco has removed horror film 'The Hospital (2013)', pictured, from its shelves following complaints about its 'extreme violence and pornography' Tesco has apologised for stocking a violent horror movie in some stores and has removed it from shelves amid claims it was unsuitable for a family supermarket. The high-street favourite decided to pull ‘The Hospital (2013)’, which is rated 18 by the British Board of Film Classification. Tesco was alerted after a customer bought the DVD and, after watching it, complained there was no warning on the cover alerting to its ‘extreme violence and pornography’. The DVD’s cover describes the film as ‘creepy, violent, bloody and fun’ and it has been described as ‘the sickest film since Rosemary’s baby.’ However, Tesco reacted promptly to the complaint and immediately instructed for it be removed from all stores. A . Tesco spokesman said: ‘The Hospital is approved for general release and . rated 18. 'However, on this occasion, we’ve made the judgement to remove . it from sale. ‘We are always pleased to listen to feedback and remain focused on offering the most popular titles to our customers.’ The film tells the tale of haunted Old St Leopald’s Hospital where a serial rapist, murderer, and psychopath called Stanley is on the loose. It centres around the killer and a young student, who is investigating ‘ghosts’ at the hospital for a school project but who quickly becomes Stanley’s ‘new pet’. Customer Matt Holmes contacted the supermarket chain after purchasing the DVD for £8 in a store in Gloucester, Gloucestershire. He . said: ‘I love horror films and I am not easily shocked. But I wasn’t . prepared for the graphic sexually violent scenes depicted in this film. ‘The quality of the film was terrible in my opinion so I’m not sure why Tesco would want to sell it anyway. ‘But it was the nature of graphic sexual violence which I found shocking. ‘I would have no problem with the film being sold online or available for rent but I didn’t expect to see it for sale in Tesco. Customer Matt Holmes said he purchased the DVD for £8 in the Tesco store in Gloucester, Gloucestershire, but complained after watching it due to its 'graphic content' ‘I . was also surprised having watched it that there was nothing on the . cover warning of the extreme nature of the content as you normally see . on films like this.’ The . founder of Netmums, Britain’s biggest parenting website, also said the . film wasn’t suitable for supermarket shelves and said it was disturbing . that children could stumble across it while browsing the DVD section. Siobhan . Freegard said: ‘The place for this DVD is a specialist film store, not . on the shelves of Britain’s biggest supermarket. Shoppers simply don’t . pop into Tesco for extreme violence and pornography. ‘Lots . of parents let their children browse the DVD section to pick up the . latest children’s films, so it’s disturbing this type of movie is on . offer alongside normal titles. ‘Supermarkets . pour millions of pounds a year into appearing family friendly, but they . need to check what’s sitting on the shelves to make sure the stock . matches the marketing message.’ After being informed the DVD was being pulled from shelves, Mr Holmes said the supermarket chain had ‘done the right thing by removing it from sale so quickly’.","Tesco took action amid fears film was too 'graphic and sexually violent'

"Tesco is at the centre of cruelty allegations over its stores in China, where turtles are being butchered or suffocated in front of customers. In some instances the reptiles are plucked from tanks and triple-wrapped in plastic bags, where they suffocate over a period of an hour. Soft-shelled turtles – a popular delicacy priced at £5 – have their heads chopped off. Cruelty: The reptiles and plucked from tanks and triple-wrapped in plastic bags, which slowly suffocates them . The scenes were witnessed by the Daily Mail in Beijing yesterday and continue despite repeated promises from Tesco dating back to 2007 to protect and promote animal welfare. The UK-Based One World Wildlife is demanding Tesco reassess its business ethics and stops selling live creatures in their supermarkets. The group is behind a petition calling on the chain’s chief executive, Philip Clarke, to stop the turtle sales, which has been signed by some 45,000 people. It says the supermarket giant should take responsibility for all stages of these creatures ‘tortured existence’ from being farmed in terrible conditions to being sold alive or butchered in store. Spokesman for the group, Dominic Neate, said: ‘We may think of turtles as pets like kittens and puppies, but Tesco will butcher them in front of your eyes, or wrap them live in plastic, unable to breathe, advising you that it’s best to eat them within the hour. ‘It is incredible for a company that claims to have high standards of animal welfare. Just because it’s in China, doesn’t make it right. This must stop now.’ China is proving to be a tough market to crack for Tesco, which is struggling to make money in the country. Last month it announced a joint venture with China Resources Enterprise (CRE), and the UK firm will combine its Tesco China business, which includes 134 stores, with the 2,986 stores held by CRE. Suffering: The Daily Mail witnessed a store attendant try repeatedly to behead a turtle . The Daily Mail went to the same Tesco stores in Beijing that were visited by David Cameron during a UK trade mission in 2010. In one, members of staff in white uniforms were standing around the meat and fish counters where tanks held live turtles, fish, bull frogs and terrapins. One caught a turtle in a pair of 10-inch metal tongs and wrapped it in three thin plastic bags. The turtle desperately fought to get out of the bag until it was returned to the customer service desk. At the Fengtai East branch, a member of staff hacked at a soft shell turtle for seven minutes, trying to chop its head off. The middle-aged staff member turned with an impatient expression, and said:  ‘Look, I’ll let you know when it’s done. The head won’t come out.’ Five minutes later the grisly job was done and the butcher, with dark blood speckles on his apron, asked if we also wanted the head, too. Animal activists say a turtle remains aware and able to move its eyes for up to an hour after decapitation unless their skulls are crushed with a hammer. An assistant explained: ‘First you chop the head off and then you lift the turtle up so as to let the blood drain. ‘When you get home, put it in boiled water to sterilise it. After a few minutes later, take a knife and cut the shell off the turtle, remove the innards and rinse it. ‘Then chop into pieces and it’s done.’ The fresh water turtles are shipped from farms in Dalian, a Northeast China coastal city. The meat sells for £6-£10 a kilo. Tesco customer Wang Shen, a 30-year-old from Beijing, said:  ‘It’s no big deal selling live turtles and bull frogs in the supermarket. ‘Each country has its own tradition. The British people are against killing turtles or bull frogs because they don’t have a tradition of eating them. ‘What do the British people think about eating cows and sheep?’ Tesco insisted it operates to higher welfare standards than any other retailer in China and that its policies are driving up standards in the country’s food supply industry. Last night, a Tesco spokesman said: 'We have listened to the concerns raised by our customers and as a result we have made several significant improvements, to ensure that the welfare of turtles sold in our China stores is of the highest possible standard. 'We hope that these actions will help to drive up standards further throughout the supply chain.'","Customers can order the animals over the counter .

The savage Tyrannosaur's skull and chest have been crushed by a massive blow inflicted by the herbivore Triceratops . Triceratops were the prey of Tyrannosaurus, which shared its lands in what is now North America.Triceratops, meaning 'three horned face', lived off low growing plants while Tyrannosaurus, 'tyrant lizard', hunted other dinosaurs. A theory proposed last year suggested that the Tyrannosaurus Rex used its fiercely strong jaw and neck muscles to literally rip the head off Triceratops after killing the huge armoured creatures.Research into Triceratops fossils from the U.S. shows that the Jurassic apex predator first slew its prey, then wrenched off its head in order to get to nutrient-rich neck meat hidden by body armour. They have been so well preserved that some of the bones are still covered in soft tissue. The fossil was accidently discovered by a ranch owner in Montana, US, and excavated by fossil hunter Clayton Phipps, also known as the 'Dino Cowboy'. Scientists believe that shortly after they died there was an earthquake that buried the bodies. They have been kept at a research lab in Montana since their discovery in 2006. The dinosaurs have since been identified as Nanotyrannus lancensis, a close relative of Tyrannosaurus rex, and Chasmosaurine ceratopsian from the Triceratops family. Nanotyrannus is thought to have been a small but extremely dangerous little tyrannosaur. Its head was about the length of an adult man's arm and could run up to 30 kilometers in short spurts. Thomas Lindgren, from Bonhams' natural history department (pictured) said he hopes the fossils are bought by a museum so they can go on public display.

'The rancher spotted some bone fragments in the ground one day and called in Clayton Phipps, the Dino Cowboy. ‘They unearthed what they thought was a Triceratops skeleton which would have been amazing on it's own - but then they spotted some vertebrae nearby. ‘Incredibly, they turned out to be from another dinosaur, a Tyrannosaurus. Lindgren added that had they been found apart, each of these fossils would have been the most complete skeletons ever found. 'But what makes the story even more amazing is that these dinosaurs were clearly locked in a bitter fight to the death that killed both of them,' he said. ‘The Tyrannosaurus's skull and chest have been crushed, while some of its teeth are embedded in the Triceratops' skull. ‘The Triceretops is huge, suggesting it was elderly, and clearly the Tyrannosaur thought he could take it out but the Triceretops was wise and powerful and had other ideas. ‘We really hope a scientific institution will come forward to ensure these incredible fossils get the treatment they deserve, then go on public display for all to see.’ The auction will take place at Bonhams in New York on November 19.

"Stung: An Italian apiary near Pisa housing prize-winning bees has been . attacked in the night by a gang of criminals . An Italian honey making business has been stung more than £100,000 after two million prize bees were killed in a suspected mafia hit. The mass slaughter was carried out using several canisters of insecticide on the honey bees - as well as protective clothing to prevent stings, police believe. Detectives think the mobsters carried out the blitz, in Titignano near Pisa, as part of an extortion racket on the owner of the apiary. But he has denied any previous intimidation or demands for money. The specialist bee farm houses prize bees used to make the Italian Millefiori brand of honey. Police said the gang used wire cutters to get through a fence during the night. They sprayed more than a dozen hives before escaping. Owner Sergio D'Agostino said: 'I've no idea why anyone would want to do something like this. 'I've lost more than two million bees and the financial cost will be huge - we are talking tens of thousands of Euros. 'This is the prime time for the bees and whoever did this knew what they were doing. It's going to take me months to get back to where I was before this attack. 'They used a powerful insecticide which you can buy in any shop and just took the hives out. It is a slaughter and they came at night so they could not be seen. 'Each hive is worth around 400 Euros, then you have the bees on top and we were due to have a new and we were due to get new clusters in shortly - that will have to be cancelled now.' A police spokesman said: 'This was obviously carried out by a gang of people who knew what they were doing. They used powerful insecticide and we suspect they were probably wearing protective suits. 'We have asked local hospitals to let us know if anyone comes in with multiple stings but so far there have been no reports. The possibility this was an operation linked to organised crime has also not been ruled out. 'We are working closely with the owner of the apiary to see if he has been the victim of threats or extortion in the past from organised crime gangs. 'It is a business operation which makes a considerable amount of money and they have now suffered financially as a result.'","Attack carried out at night using canisters of insecticide and wire cutters .

"These are the pictures proving that there is finally love and happiness for the boy who suffered the most appalling neglect when his American adoptive mother sent him on a plane back to his Russian motherland with a note saying she no longer wanted him. Torry Hansen, a 34-year-old nurse, unilaterally revoked her adoption of Justin, then seven, that she had agreed after travelling to Russia and plucking him from an orphanage in 2009 offering him a new life in the West. Less than a year later the child had virtually forgotten his Russian when he was unceremoniously dumped alone on the plane and sent back to Moscow, with a note  'to whom it may concern' saying: 'I no longer wish to parent this child'. Artem Saveliev, aged nine, is now living with a foster family outside Moscow. Last spring his American adoptive mother put Artem, who was then going by the American name Justin, alone on a plane to Russia with a note pinned to his clothing . Her action sparked worldwide outrage and a diplomatic rift between Moscow and Washington, as the Russian authorities - left to pick up the pieces - desperately sought a suitable home for a child who Hansen also cruelly labelled 'mentally unstable'. The Kremlin's tsar for children Pavel Astakhov took a personal interest in the case but despite his efforts, initially the right home for the boy eluded them. Yet now almost two years on from his horror flight, Justin finally feels loved and cared for - thanks to a remarkable Russian foster mother. Once again, he now lives under the name he was born with - Artem Saveliev - and he is approaching his tenth birthday. Vera Egorova, 53, is the woman he now calls Mama. She is an 'SOS mother' in Tomilino village, part of an unusual and highly effective project to rescue society's most neglected children. A former office worker, she has no children of her own yet she now mothers six, all under 18, and has 11 more who have grown up and left her village.  To her, they are all her sons and daughters, and she raises them with her husband Vasiliy Tibenko, 46. 'Artem came to live with us on  25 October last year (2011),' she recalled. 'We had a party that day - my daughter Sonya turned 9 - we invited Artem to join us and eat something but he was not so keen. ' Artem now calls Vera Egorova, right, Mama. She and her husband hope to adopted him and five other children they have been fostering. The Kremlin's tsar for children, Pavel Astakhov, left, has a special interest in Artem's case and makes periodic visits . He was 'exhausted by plane flights and going back and forth between orphanages and foster parents', she said. 'He then walked around our house, met the other children.  I went  with him saying - 'Look, this is your home now, you will live with us here, in our family'. 'I told him there are two more kids of the his age and he would not feel lonely. In the evening our kids talked to him and told about our life - that we are one family here, kids call each other brothers and sister, and here are your mother and father. 'We don't say orphanage, and we want Artem to find a good family here, not just another orphanage. 'Next day Artem began to call me 'Mama'. He asked me for a notebook and a pen and said he wanted to write a diary. 'He also went to our local school. Now, almost six months later, I can say he's coping well. He is a good student in school, not the very best but all is fine. There are a few slight behavioural problems, but this is natural, he's a typical boy. He went to the winter camp with other kids for New Year and learned to skate. He says he likes it here, especially that we are a family rather than an orphanage.' Her description of him is far from the label that Hansen and her mother tagged him with before packing him back to Russia. Vera says Artem is a good student in school, not the very best but fine. And unlike the claims of his former adoptive mother, Vera says there are only slight behavioural problems that are typical of a boy . 'Artem is a nice boy, very kind and responsive. He is also very reasonable, as if he is older than his years,' said Vera. 'He likes to help me around the house, to clean and cook. The other day he helped me to clean and fry potatoes. 'I simply do not see that Artem has problems communicating with other children. I think he is mentally normal, there's no problem to establish good contact with him. He is just a child with a very sad life experience and our task is to help him. One day if he wants to tell me his story, I'll listen carefully, but I won't push him, if he wants to forget it, it is his right to do so.' Before Hansen chose him at the orphanage in the far east of Russia, he had been neglected and rejected once already - by his natural mother, who was stripped of her parental rights by a Russian court. It is hard to know how the impact of his treatment will affect him as he gets older but Vera is confident she can help him to grow up normally. 'I was shocked when I heard Artem's story, who wouldn't be? 'Whatever happened in his American family, that woman did not have a moral right to throw him away like a useless thing. 'I am sure there is a clever legal way to cancel adoption if it is all going wrong so I cannot begin to understand why she chose such an inhuman way.' She said that Artem now wants to forget his time in the US, so painful was the ending. 'He does not like to recall anything about America and does not want to answer any questions about it. He openly tells me this.' She stressed: 'Frankly, I was also surprised to know that normal healthy kids like Artem can be adopted by foreigners. I was sure before that it was sick and disabled kids can go to live abroad where foreign people have money and facilities to help them and take proper care. Tennessee nurse Torry Hansen took a trip to Russia in 2009 and met Artem, who she renamed Justin, in an orphanage. Their meeting is pictured here . 'I do not think it is right to let . healthy good Russian kids to leave our country. We must take better take . care of them ourselves.' 'I am glad that God gave me the chance to work and live here. 'I became a mum here, I started a family, I just became happy here. I am so proud that I am a mum of 17 kids, can you believe it? Artem is the 17th and he is  loved as much as all the others which is as much as any child can be loved. 'My elder kids come to see me with their children and they all call me grandma. ' This way Artem and the other younger children see that they will have a proper family, too, after they grow up. 'My husband and I now plan to officially adopt  all the six kids including Artem who live with us now, so we will be a totally normal legal family,' she confided. Astakhov's determination that right must be done by this child have paid off, and the Kremlin official regularly finds time to visit and check up on Artem's progress. Vera spoke as a US judge this week ruled that Hansen, from Shelbyville  in Tennessee, must pay child support even though she has not been prosecuted for neglect. Worth forgetting: A swing set seen here in Hansen's shared backyard in Tennessee is part of life Artem hopes to forget . This followed a lawsuit from her adoption agency, World Association for Children and Parents. The judgement was made even though Hansen has now vanished to California. 'I do not believe that I can obtain a fair and unbiased hearing from this court,' she said in a letter faxed to the court. 'Whether or not Ms. Hansen will ever realise the consequences of her actions remains to be seen, but at least we know now there has a been a ruling by the court that she has been determined to be liable for her actions,' said Larry Crain, attorney for WACAP, after the hearing. The sum that must be paid in support is yet to be fixed, and it  is likely to accumulate and go to Artem when he is an adult. 'The irony is if you leave a child in a car with the windows rolled up in a parking lot today, you can be arrested,' said Crain. 'But sending a child 3,000 miles across the Atlantic and there are no consequences for it, that is truly disturbing.' At least, though, Artem finally has the loving home he so craved.","Torry Hansen adopted Artem in 2009 and sent him back to Russia in 2010 .

"A Milwaukee woman accused of killing a pregnant woman, cutting out her baby and passing off the child as her own dropped her insanity plea during a final hearing today before her trial starts next week. Annette Morales-Rodriguez, 34, had previously pleaded not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect to two counts of first-degree intentional homicide, including homicide of an unborn child. The mother-of-three is accused of killing 23-year-old Maritza Ramirez-Cruz last October and slicing out the fetus to pass off the child as her own. The boy, who would have been Ramirez-Cruz’s fourth child, also died. Plea dropped: Annette Morales-Rodriguez, 34, is accused of killing a pregnant woman and cutting out her baby in October last year. She dropped her insanity plea on Thursday before her trial starts on Monday . Victim: Maritza Ramirez-Cruz, 23, was expecting her fourth child when she was murdered last October. Her baby boy, who she planned to call Omar, also died . An earlier defence team planned to pursue an insanity plea, but the court-ordered doctor didn't find evidence to support that argument. Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge David Borowski said Thursday that the opinion of someone hired by the previous defence attorneys would not stand up in court. Morales-Rodriguez changed her plea to not guilty during the hearing Thursday. She answered Borowski's questions about whether she approved and understood the change, through an interpreter, with 'Correct,' 'I remember,' or 'I understand.' Morales-Rodriguez is accused of faking a pregnancy because she couldn't get pregnant and her boyfriend wanted a baby boy. Tragedy: Maritza Ramirez-Cruz had three children and was expecting her fourth when she was savagely murdered after offered a ride . She allegedly panicked as her . supposed due date grew near and scoured the suburban Milwaukee . neighbourhood for two weeks looking for a pregnant woman whose child she . could steal and call her own. On October 6 2011, she saw Maritza Ramirez-Cruz - a total stranger - and offered her a ride. When . she got in the car, however, Morales-Rodriguez said she needed to go . back to her home to change her shoes, and Ramirez-Cruz followed her in . to use the bathroom. It . was when she came out of the toilet that Morales-Rodriguez allegedly attacked her . with a baseball bat, striking her in the head several times. With . Ramirez-Cruz on the ground, her attacker choked her until she . passed out, and cut her open using an X-Acto knife, attempting a Cesaerean section that she . had seen done on the Discovery Channel, according to the complaint. Ramirez-Cruz died of loss of blood and asphyxiation. The boy died as a result of the mother's death, the complaint said. Suspect: Annette Morales-Rodriguez, seen left and right, is accused of murdering Maritza Ramirez-Cruz then savagely cutting out her unborn child. Morales-Rodriguez has pleaded not guilty . Tragedy: Maritza Ramirez-Cruz, bottom left, had three children and was expecting her fourth when she was savagely murdered last October . Morales-Rodriguez then hid Ramirez-Cruz's body in her basement. Later that evening, emergency services responded to a . call from Morales-Rodriguez, who said that she had . just given birth to a child who was not breathing, according to the . criminal complaint. Paramedics were unable to revive the boy and he was pronounced dead at the scene. Morales-Rodriguez was taken to the hospital but, . after an autopsy of the full-term baby - and medical examinations of the . woman herself, it was determined that she was not pregnant and had not recently given birth. The next day, police returned to Morales-Rodriguez's home and found Ramirez-Cruz's mutilated body. Prosecutor Mark Williams said he plans to play a videotaped confession by Morales-Rodriguez during the trial, which is expected to start with jury selection Monday and last a week. Crime scene: The house near 7th and Mitchell streets, where Annette Morales-Rodriguez allegedly killed 23-year-old Ramirez-Cruz . Similar cases of women taking an unborn child from a mother's womb were reported in Massachusetts and Oregon in 2009, in Pennsylvania in 2007, in Illinois in 2006 and Missouri in 2004. In the Oregon case, a woman obsessed with having a baby pleaded guilty last year to the murder of a pregnant woman whose unborn child was cut from her abdomen after she was bludgeoned to death. Korena Roberts, 29, was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. In Massachusetts, a Worcester woman, Julie Corey, pleaded not guilty to killing her pregnant friend, Darlene Hayes, and cutting the baby from Hayes' womb. Corey and the baby were found in a homeless shelter in Plymouth, N.H., in July 2009, just days after Hayes was found dead with a fractured skull.","Annette Morales-Rodriguez accused in savage murder of 23-year-old Maritza Ramirez-Cruz .

"Scientists claim to have shed  light on how dinosaurs divided up their meals allowing them to co-exist in harsh prehistoric ecosystems. Large, long-necked plant-eating dinosaurs, such as Diplodocus, dominated the land between 210 million and 65 million years ago and would have need huge amounts of food. These sauropods were the largest land animals of all time, with the biggest weighing 80 tonnes - more than 11 elephants. By analysing dinosaur skulls, scientists claim to have shed light on how dinosaurs divided up their meals allowing them to co-exist in harsh prehistoric ecosystems. Pictured is a completed skull model of the Late Jurassic North American sauropod dinosaur Camarasaurus . Researchers from the University of Bristol and the Natural History Museum in London believe that multiple sauropod species survived in the same habitats because of their different diets. The Late Jurassic Morrison Formation - a distinctive sequence of sedimentary rock in the western United States - contained more than 10 species of sauropod. In comparison,the highly diverse faunas seen in modern Africa only support one gigantic species, the elephant. Experts studied a digital reconstruction of the skulls, jaws and neck muscles of the sauropods Camarasaurus and Diplodocus to investigate how they fed. This GIF reveals the constructed skull from various angles. Researchers were able to use models, such as this, to determine teeth size and structure . The University of Bristol and the Natural History Museum in London analysed sauropod skulls found in the Morrison Formation (shown), which extends throughout Western United States . Experts studied a digital reconstruction of the skulls, jaws and neck muscles of the sauropods Camarasaurus (left) and Diplodocus (right) to investigate how they fed.  The top skulls in this image have a reconstructed jaw (in multiple colours).  In the bottom image, hotter colours refer to areas of higher stress when biting . David Button, a PhD student at Bristol's School of Earth Sciences, said: 'Our results show that although neither could chew, the skulls of both dinosaurs were sophisticated cropping tools. 'Camarasaurus had a robust skull and strong bite, which would have allowed it to feed on tough leaves and branches. 'Meanwhile, the weaker bite and more delicate skull of Diplodocus would have restricted it to softer foods like ferns. Its fossilised right shinbone (right) and left hipbone (bottom) were found together and analysis showed the animal was different to other species found . A primitive meat-eating dinosaur that roamed the Earth about 200 million years ago has been dug up in South America. The new species, about the size of a lion and found high up in the Venezuelan Andes, was an ancestor of Tyrannosaurus Rex, Velociraptor and Spinosaurus. More than 6ft (1.8 metres) long, it is one of the few dinosaurs ever recovered from northern South America, and the first carnivorous member of the group discovered in Venezuela. At the time all the planet’s landmass was wrapped up in one supercontinent Pangaea surrounded by a giant ocean and was just beginning to break up into the modern continents we now see today. Named Tachiraptor admirabilis after Tachira state where it was unearthed, it was a predator theropod but would probably have snacked on the abundant ferns as well. Tachiraptor was around at the beginning of the period known geologically as the Jurassic, and helps explain the spread of carvivorous dinosaurs following the Triassic mass extinction shortly before. Half the world’s animals were mysteriously wiped out by either climate change, volcanic eruptions or an asteroid impact. Its fossilised right shinbone and left hipbone were found together and analysis showed the animal was different to other species found, the study published in the journal Royal Society Open Science said. 'However, Diplodocus could also have used its strong neck muscles to help it detach plant material through movements of the head. 'This indicates differences in diet between the two dinosaurs, which would have allowed them to co-exist.' The researchers also used a series of biomechanical measurements from other sauropod species to calculate the difference in movement in their skulls and jaws. They found that other Morrison Formation sauropods were also highly varied in feeding adaptations, which suggests they had different diets. Large, long-necked plant-eating dinosaurs, such as Diplodocus (artist's impression pictured), dominated the land between 210 million and 65 million years ago and would have need huge amounts of food . Professor Emily Rayfield of the University of Bristol, co-author of the report, said: 'In modern animal communities differences in diet such as this - termed dietary niche partitioning - allow multiple similar species to co-exist by reducing competition for food. 'Although dietary niche partitioning has been suspected between Morrison Formation sauropods based on their structural features and patterns of tooth-wear, this is the first study to provide strong, numerical, biomechanical evidence for its presence in this fossil community.' Co-author Professor Paul Barrett of the Natural History Museum added: 'Our study provides insight not only into the ecology of dinosaurs but more generally into the mechanisms supporting species-richness in other animal communities, both from the fossil record and in the present day.' The research, funded by the Natural Environment Research Council, was published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.","Sauropod species survived in same habitats because of different diets .

"A Connecticut father-of-three has told a court the horrifying story of leaving his 15-month-old son on the backseat of the car for the whole day he was at work after forgetting to drop the little boy off at daycare in the morning. According to police, Kyle Seitz, 36, drove his car three times with his toddler dead in the back seat after forgetting him when he went into work. He went to lunch and back, then drove to his son Benjamin's daycare eight hours after work before finally realizing the 15-month-old was dead in his Jeep, he told authorities. Seitz surrendered in his hometown of Ridgefield,  at 4pm on Tuesday after learning there was a warrant for his arrest over the tragic death of Benjamin in July. In the 15-page arrest warrant presented to Danbury Superior Court on Wednesday, it was detailed how Seitz missed the turnoff to the daycare center where he should have dropped Benjamin after leaving home about 8.46am, and drove on to get coffee before reporting for work. A software programmer, he left his job at lunch to get a sandwich and still did not noticing his son on the back seat of his Jeep Cherokee, according to The New York Times. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Mistake: Kyle Seitz told police he accidentally left his 15-month-old son on the backseat of the car for the entire day on July 7. Seitz is seen here facing Danbury Superior Court Wednesday on November 12, 2014 . Negligent: Seitz has been charged with criminally negligent homicide in the death of his 15-month old son, but told police the incident was a terrible accident . Father and son: Kyle Seitz, 36, surrendered in his hometown of Ridgefield, Connecticut, on Tuesday after learning there was a warrant for his arrest over the tragic death of Benjamin (pictured with Seitz) in July . Tragic: It comes nearly three months after the state's medical examiner's office ruled that the incident was a homicide, saying Benjamin (left and right) died as a result of hyperthermia due to environmental exposure . Seitz finished his afternoon at work and drove to the daycare to pick up Benjamin at 5pm. When staff at the center said Benjamin was not there, he 'walked out heading to his car in the parking lot and began walking faster', according to the arrest warrant. He told the authorities that he 'felt shock and terror' when he discovered that his son was in the back seat 'motionless'. Seitz has now been charged with criminally negligent homicide. It comes nearly three months after the state's medical examiner's office ruled that the  incident was a homicide, saying Benjamin died as a result of hyperthermia due to environmental exposure. However, at the time, authorities determined that further inquires needed to be carried out before any charges could be potentially filed. Officials issued an arrest warrant for Seitz only this week. 'He continues to have the support of his family and close friends,' the suspect's attorney John Gulash, said in a statement on Tuesday, according to the New York Daily News. 'It is a difficult time for everyone.' Seitz, who has two daughters, aged eight and six, was supposed to take Benjamin to daycare on July 7, but forgot and instead went to work, police said. He reportedly left his son alone inside his parked car for more than seven hours as temperatures climbed to the upper 80s. He only realized his mistake when he returned to his vehicle. Too young: At the time of the ruling, authorities determined that further inquires needed to be carried out before any charges could be potentially filed. Above, Benjamin is pictured smiling in a family photo . Scene: Seitz, who has two daughters, was supposed to take Benjamin to daycare on July 7, but forgot and instead went to work, police said. He left his son in a car in this parking lot (pictured) in high temperatures . After discovering Benjamin lying unresponsive on the car's back seat, he apparently rushed the toddler to Danbury Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Just weeks after Benjamin's death, the child's mother, Lindsey Rogers-Seitz, said she forgave her husband of 12 years, describing the Owl Computing Technologies employee as an 'amazing father'. 'I love my husband,' she told the Associated Press at the time. 'Of course I forgive him. But it doesn't mean that our lives aren't different now. 'So we have to move forward with a new different reality for us, and it's always going to be that way.' Standing by her husband: Just weeks after Benjamin's death, the child's mother, Lindsey Rogers-Seitz (pictured speaking to Today), said she forgave her husband of 12 years, describing him as an 'amazing father' Expressing her grief: Mrs Rogers-Seitz has since set up a website, thegiftofben.com (pictured) , on which she writes about her feelings and daily life following Benjamin's death. Above, the website's homepage . Mrs Rogers-Seitz has since set up a website, thegiftofben.com, on which she writes about her feelings and daily life following Benjamin's death. She has also become an advocate for technology that could help prevent people from accidentally leaving children in cars. 'If it can happen to us it can happen to anybody,' she said. More than three dozen children die of hyperthermia - a very high body temperature - in cars annually in the United States. Since 1998, more than 600 children have died in hot cars. Heatstroke can happen when the temperature is as low as 57 degrees, and car interiors can reach well over 110 degrees even when the outside temperature is in the 60s. Happier times: After discovering Benjamin lying unresponsive on the car's back seat, he apparently rushed the toddler to Danbury Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Above, the toddler at a younger age . Innocent: Seitz, who has been charged with criminally negligent homicide, was released on a promise to appear in Danbury Superior Court on Wednesday. Above, his son is seen (left and right) before his death . Criminal charges were filed in about half the cases of child vehicular heat stroke deaths from 2004 to 2013, according to KidsAndCars.org, a nonprofit group that tracks child deaths and injuries in and around automobiles. The group said charges were filed in 177 cases, while in 160 cases there were no charges and in 34 cases it was unclear. Of the cases involving charges, 96 cases led to convictions and 21 cases had no convictions. In 57 cases the outcome is unknown, the group said. Of 220 cases in which a child was unknowingly left in a car, about half led to charges and at least 62 resulted in convictions, KidsAndCars.org said. Seitz will appear at Danbury Superior Court on Wednesday, NBC Connecticut reported. The charge against him is a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in prison upon conviction.","Kyle Seitz, 36, handed himself into police in Connecticut Tuesday .

"'Concerned': Foreign Secretary William Hague today said Britain 'should be concerned' about the activities of North Korea . William Hague has urged everyone to remain ‘calm’ in the face of ‘paranoid rhetoric’ coming out of North Korea.The Foreign Secretary said scaremongering by Pyongyang amounted to an authoritarian government trying to justify to its own starving people why it had missiles but no tractors.He said there was little evidence of the sort of military build-up that would be expected ahead of a major conflict.His call for caution came as the US defence secretary Chuck Hagel said he would delay testing a missile from a California airbase until next month to reduce tensions.Mr Hague said: ‘We have to be concerned about the danger of miscalculation by the North Korean regime, which has worked itself up into this frenetic state of rhetoric in recent weeks, and the danger that they would believe their own paranoid rhetoric. 'But it is important that the international response to this, including our response, must be clear and united and calm.” He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show that leader Kim Jong-un’s behaviour was typical of authoritarian leaders who were keen to justify the need to arm themselves in the face of an external threat.‘What is going on here could easily be what we have often seen throughout history among authoritarian and totalitarian regimes. 'Remember that this is a regime that has to justify the intense militarisation of their society and the development of these weapons and missiles, even though many people in their country are regularly and seriously short even of food,’ Mr Hague said. 'Threat': Speaking on the Andrew Marr Show today, Mr Hague said there was a threat to the world 'from any country breaching the non-proliferation treaty, which North Korea is doing' Forces: North Korean soldiers working today beside their military fences near the demilitarized zone separating the North from South Korea, in this picture taken from an observation post of the South . ‘To justify that you have to have an external threat ... or danger you can point to.’ Pyongyang’s warning last week that it could not guarantee the safety of . foreign embassy staff from this coming Wednesday was consistent with . that, he said. But Britain has refused to withdraw embassy staff from the peninsula, signalling that it believes it is all a bluff. Mr Hague warned North Korea that it would remain ‘isolated’ and without . friends if it continued to build up missiles while its citizens went . hungry. ‘There is an enormous gap. This is a country where many people are . working in the field. It is a case of manual labour in the fields . without many tractors - so they are short of tractors. But they do have . the machines that carry long-range and intermediate-range missiles . around. He added: ‘If the leadership of North Korea continue on their current . path over the coming months and years, they will end up leading a broken . country that is internationally isolated.’ At the weekend, the US announced it would suspend a ballistic missile test in the region to avoid any ‘miscalculation’. Warning: North Korea announced on Friday that it will not guarantee the safety of international embassies in Pyongyang if war breaks out. Pictured is Kim Jong-un visiting North Korea border troops on an army ship . Meanwhile, China yesterday distanced itself from its North Korea ally. Chinese President Xi Jinping, addressing a forum on the southern island . of Hainan, said no country 'should be allowed to throw a region and even . the whole world into chaos for selfish gain', in apparent reference to . North Korea. Last night, South Korea said its neighbour was still planning to test a missile or engage in a provocative act. A top security official added, however that the North’s clearest . objective was to extract concessions from Washington and Seoul Kim . Jang-Soo said the notice to diplomats could be an attempt to force . America to offer dialogue. It is believed that North Korea could launch a Musudam missile which could strike American bases in Guam, some 2,490 miles away. Switzerland - where the young Kim Jong-un was educated - has offered to mediate as tensions escalate on the Korean peninsula.","Foreign Secretary says 'danger of miscalculation' must be considered .

"The fearsome claws that once made up a dinosaur's killing repertoire may have evolved to have a much more mundane and everyday use. Theropod dinosaurs - a group which includes the Tyrannosaurus Rex and velociraptor - are often regarded as carnivorous, predatory animals, using their sharp claws to capture prey. But, a detailed analysis of the claws on the forelimbs of a unique group of these dinosaurs has revealed that the form and shape varied widely between species, suggesting they may have been used for digging and grasping. A study from the University of Bristol has revealed that during their transition from carnivores to herbivores, therapod dinosaurs developed a large variety of claw shapes adapted to specific functions such as digging, grasping or piercing. This illustration shows the different shapes in the therizinosaur group of theropods . Theropod dinosaurs - a group which . includes the Tyrannosaurus Rex and velociraptor - are often regarded as . carnivorous, predatory animals. The name, for example, means 'beast footed'. Therizinosaurs were an unusual group of theropods that lived between 145 and 66 million years ago. They were large animals - up to 22ft (7 metres) tall with claws more than 19 inches (50 cm) long on . their forelimbs. They also had elongated necks and a coat of primitive, down-like . feathers along their bodies. Unlike their nearest relatives, however, the teeth and jaw morphology of therizinosaurs suggest they were herbivores. Dr Stephan Lautenschlager from Bristol University’s School of Earth Sciences studied the differences in claw shape to see how they are related to different functions. His research, published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, focused on the therizinosaurs - an unusual group of theropods that lived between 145 and 66 million years ago. Dr Lautenschlager said therizinosaurs were very large animals, up to 22ft (7 metres) tall, with claws more than 19 inches (50 cm) long on their forelimbs. They also had elongated necks and a coat of primitive, down-like feathers along their bodies. Unlike their nearest relatives, however, the teeth and jaw morphology of therizinosaurs suggest they were herbivores. To fully understand how the different . claws on the forelimbs were used, detailed computer models were created . to simulate a variety of possible functions for different species and . claw morphologies. The . dinosaur claws were also compared to the claws of modern-day mammals. To understand how the different claws on the forelimbs were used, computer models were created to simulate a variety of possible functions. The claws were also compared to those of modern-day mammals. This is a fossil of the enlarged claws on the forelimbs of the Therizinosaurus cheloniformes . In the course of evolution, several theropod groups, including therizinosaurs, changed from being carnivores to become plant eaters. The new study reveals that, during this transition, theropod dinosaurs developed a large variety of claw shapes adapted to specific functions, such as digging, grasping or piercing. Dr Lautenschlager said: ‘Theropod . dinosaurs were all bipedal, which means their forelimbs were no longer . involved in walking as in other dinosaurs. 'This allowed them to develop a . whole new suite of claw shapes adapted to different functions.’ 'It’s fascinating to see that, with the shift from a carnivorous to a plant-based diet, we find a large variety of claw shapes adapted to different functions. ‘This suggests dietary adaptations were an important driver during the evolution of theropod dinosaurs and their transition to modern birds.’ The research also found the claws of the nothronychus theropod adapted specifically for digging.","Analysis of theropod dinosaur claws revealed a variety of different shapes .

"The U.S. and New Zealand collaborated on a top-secret plan to develop a 'tsunami bomb' capable of devastating coastal cities, it has emerged. The countries carried out covert tests of the potential weapon of mass destruction - designed to use underwater explosions to trigger huge tidal waves - in waters around Auckland and the Pacific island of New Caledonia during the Second World War. Details of the secretive operation, code-named Project Seal, were discovered in military files buried in New Zealand's national archives by author and film-maker Ray Waru. 'Absolutely astonishing': Author Ray Waru discovered details of Project Seal while trawling through New Zealand's national archives . Mr Waru, who came across the files while carrying out research for his new book, described the evidence of the plot to create a possible rival to the nuclear bomb as 'absolutely astonishing'. The files revealed how around 3,700 bombs were exploded during testing, which was launched in June 1944, and indicated that the weapon was feasible. The tests also revealed a series of 10 large offshore blasts could potentially result in a 33ft tsunami that would wreak havoc on a coastal city, according to a report in the Daily Telegraph. Mr Waru said: 'It was absolutely astonishing. First that anyone would come up with the idea of developing a weapon of mass destruction based on a tsunami... and also that New Zealand seems to have successfully developed it to the degree that it might have worked.' 'Tsunami bomb': The plan was to develop a device capable of devastating coastal cities by using underwater explosions to trigger huge tidal waves . He explained that while initial testing was positive, Project Seal was shelved in early 1945. Experts concluded it would be necessary to arrange around two million kilograms of explosives about five miles from a shoreline in order to create a successful tsunami bomb. Details of the shadowy project are included in Mr Waru's new book Secrets and Treasures, which also incorporates other bizarre findings from his trawl through New Zealand's national archives. As well as Project Seal, Mr Waru discovered Defence Department records detailing thousands of UFO sightings. Members of the public, military personnel and pilots were among those who reported seeing moving lights in the skies over New Zealand.","Countries carried out covert tests of a device designed to use underwater explosions to trigger massive tidal waves .

"She was the nerdy feminist with an ‘awful haircut’ and ‘hideous Coke bottle glasses’. He was a ‘Viking’ of a man with a six-inch beard who towered over everyone he met. But this is this is how one of America’s greatest political dynasties began, according to the screenplay of Rodham, about the early life of Hillary Clinton. The script, a copy of which has been . shown to MailOnline by a Hollywood source, gives a riveting fictional . account of how the former First Lady and future Presidential candidate . met husband Bill - set to the soundtrack of Carly Simon’s You’re So . Vain. The way we were: Bill and Hillary pictured in their younger years after meeting at Yale in 1972 . Hot politics: The script rather ungallanty says 'she¿s the valedictorian of the 'look-like-s*** school of feminism¿ . There is romance and sex including one scene in which the pair ‘devour’ each other. There is the ambition of the potential 2016 Presidential candidate who was chosen in her 20s to serve on the House Judiciary Committee which looked into impeaching President Richard Nixon. But above all there is the story of somebody who refuses to let anything get in her way of getting to the top - man or woman. MailOnline has been told by sources that the script has not yet received financial backing and is being extensively rewritten. It is based on real events but screenwriter Young Il Kim, a South Korean who was living in New Jersey at the time he wrote it, has taken artistic licence when it comes to dialogue. Love story: The screenplay Rodham tells how former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met husband, former president Bill Clinton . Mr Kim said the script was intended to show the ‘journey of a person who is faced with the impossible choice of her career ambitions and personal desires’. He said: ‘This is a story about a woman who was a political rock star and had as bright a future coming out of Yale Law as Bill if not more. ‘And the story is about someone who is so assured of her destiny in Washington D.C. until she meets the one person in the world who makes her make this the most impossible dilemma. ‘And she faces this difficult choice when she is 26 in 1974, in an era when most women realize that they cannot have both a career and a family.’ As a result, the story is as much about the relationship between Mr Clinton and Mrs Clinton, whose maiden name is Rodham, as it is about her ascent to the White House. Beauty: Hillary Clinton, pictured as a student in 1969, several years before she met her husband Bill . Driven: Hillary, center, with fellow students at Wellesley in 1969, is described as having 'hideous Coke bottle glasses' in the screenplay . Don't mess: In the script, Hillary decides to stop wearing skirts and wears pant suits to be taken more seriously . The script details how the pair met at Yale College in 1972 in the law school library where she is tutoring a young Robert Reich, who would go on to be Labour Secretary in her husband’s administration. Mrs Clinton is described as a ‘blonde girl whose face is hidden behind an awful haircut and a hideous pair of COKE-BOTTLE glasses’. It reads: ‘Her tie-dyed T-shirt has a faded “AuH2O” on it. She’s the valedictorian of the 'look-like-s*** school of feminism.’ Mr Clinton is a ‘a VIKING of a man slows down to watch her. He has a full mane and a six-inch beard.’ The then Miss Rodham notices him gazing at her, slams her book shut and storms up to him to demand an explanation. Her ‘piercing gaze’ leaves Mr Clinton speechless until the credits roll, set to the music of Carly Simon’s You’re So Vain. Over the 118 pages the script details how the pair then drift apart and get back together until 1974 when she joins in him Arkansas where he is running for a seat in the House - having effectively chosen his career over hers. Work in progress: The screenplay Rodham which focuses on the love story of Bill and Hillary Clinton has been written by Young Il Kim . On her journey she encounters all the travails of being a woman in a man’s world in the 1970s. Mrs Clinton tells a friend that her friend Betsey Wright, who would go on to her her husband’s chief of staff, thinks she should change her appearance to give herself ‘torpedo titties’ to make herself more appealing. She later decides to stop wearing skirts and wears pant suits to be taken more seriously. Mr Clinton’s mother Virginia, however, disapproves of her attire so much that she gives her a tight-fitting blue dress to wear during a family visit. Sexism even comes from Mr Clinton’s own family in the form of his half-brother Roger Clinton Jr, who raises a laugh at a family gathering with the joke: ‘Who do you think f***** more women? Bill or Hillary?’ The script describes how Mrs Clinton is outraged when her husband is first offered the job on the House Judiciary Committee by chairman John Doar instead of her. He got the call while she was standing in the room and declined as he was entering politics himself. In a screaming row she later tells him: ‘Your mother hates me. Your brother hates me. Your staff hates me. I want to go where I’m not hated, where I’m not a consolation prize!’ Passion: In one scene the pair 'devour' each other . She also tells a friend that he can ‘burn in hell’ as he is just ‘using me for the apartment’. Outraged Mrs Clinton complains that he ‘isn’t even using me for sex’. When asked if she really isn’t having sex with him, she says: ‘It depends upon what the meaning of the word “sex” means’. But it is not all stormy waters, and there are scenes of intimacy between the two. Mr Clinton first proposes in 1972 when Mrs Clinton is 26 and working for the Children’s Defence Fund, whilst he is assistant professor of law at the University of Arkansas. In true Clinton style, he does it rather casually as the resignation of Vice President Spiro Agnew plays on a TV in the background. Mr Kim writes that Mrs Clinton ‘wanted this for so long and it’s finally happening’ but does not seem to take it seriously or give him an answer. He later proposes again in dramatic fashion as he is about to get on a plane but she cannot say yes, even when he puts the ring in front of her finger. Mr Kim writes: ‘She shakes, unable to speak. Her world crumbles in the most wonderful yet devastating way. ‘Her heart wants to say yes. But her mind calculates the ramifications. She doesn’t know.’ Mr Kim also writes of when they have sex Mr Clinton ‘eyes her with such intensity that she feels naked, vulnerable, and aroused all at once’. Power couple: Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton on their wedding day, October 11, 1975 in Fayetteville, Arkansas . He writes: ‘A seductive, penetrating gaze that makes her want to explode with pent-up desires. ‘He grabs her wrists and pins her against the wall. Feeling so wonderfully submissive to his primal, masculine needs. ‘Bill tears off the buttons of her blouse. As he buries his head into her cleavage...’ Their attempt to have sex ends in a comic note when they check their voicemail messages which include the call from Mr Doar - sparking a row which ends the liaison. The bulk of the script is about Mrs Clinton’s time on the Impeachment Committee and how she wins the approval of older, male colleagues by being brilliant at her job. She is assigned to work with William Weld, a 28-year-old rising star who Mr Kim describes as having ‘golden hair, dashing good looks, and tall and muscular frame. He won the genetic lottery.’ Mrs Clinton jokingly compares him to Ryan O’Neal in Love Story and they almost kiss on the roof of the Congressional Hotel. Instead they are interrupted by a phone call from Mr Clinton wishing her happy birthday. She is touched when he plays ‘Hail to the chief’ on the saxophone down the line, winning her heart again. The pair then go from strength to strength, with Mr Clinton helping Mrs Clinton’s work by suggesting she subpoena President Nixon’s recordings from the Roosevelt Room. She replies: ‘I f***** love you. I mean that. I love you and I want to f*** you’. Mrs Clinton ignores him flirting with a waitress by using his stock line that the watermelons of Hope, Arkansas, his home town are the ‘firmest, juiciest melons’. She looks the other way when a 20-year-old girl emerges out of his campaign office right in front of her with a smile on her face. It is not until 1974 when she is in Arkansas helping Mr Clinton run for the House of Representatives against Republican incumbent John Paul Hammerschmidt that they fall out again because his campaign staff mocked her. The script says that she was so furious that ‘everything about him and his world repulses her’. Mrs Clinton tells him: ‘I really tried. I tried and tried. I thought I could make this work but I can’t. I can’t do this. Mr Clinton says: ‘Then don’t. If you can’t handle the campaign, don’t.’ Mr Kim writes that her ‘heart breaks’ as she says: ‘I mean us’. The scene ends with the song You Can’t Always Get What You Want by the Rolling Stones, suggesting they are over - but as history would show, the partnership would last.","Former Secretary of State and former President met as students at Yale in 1972 .

"Claims: Scotland Yard has reportedly interviewed the wife of a soldier that said Princess Diana was assassinated by the SAS . Critics today dismissed claims that the SAS murdered Princess Diana as a 'mystifying stunt' based on 'nonsense' evidence from an 'erratic' sniper in jail for illegally keeping guns at home. Royal bodyguards and MPs have brushed off accusations that the Princess of Wales' death 16 years ago in Paris was carried out by British special forces who then 'covered it up'. Scotland Yard confirmed yesterday that . officers from its specialist crime and operations command are assessing . information handed to it ‘recently’ by the Royal Military Police. But experts say that the evidence is flimsy and from a 'loose cannon' military man - known as Soldier N. His extraordinary allegation emerged during the second court martial of . Sergeant Danny Nightingale, who was found guilty of illegally possessing . a gun and ammunition. It was outlined in a letter written by Soldier N's mother-in-law, who was a key witness for the prosecution. Ken Wharfe, who was Diana's Scotland Yard bodyguard told the Evening Standard: 'If this was 30 years ago the police desk sergeant would have thrown out this kind of nonsense before it went too far. But we live in different times. 'If . these parents were so concerned that this information was relevant or . had some general import, then they should have delivered it to the . inquest. 'Why has it taken so long to air this new . information? It seems so shallow to me. I just think it's a bit of a . publicity stunt. For what reason I'm not certain, but in the absence of . any real evidence, I'm sure this will go away', he added to the Daily Telegraph. Colonel Tim Collins, a former SAS officer, added: 'It's utter nonsense. This is just wishful thinking on the part of somebody.' Another former soldier said: 'This is a preposterous claim and highly insulting to the name of the regiment which exists to serve Queen and country'. Dai Davies, who was in charge of royal . protection when Diana died said: 'I'm mystified ... how any new . information can possibly allege anything other than [that] this was a . tragic accident'. Princess Diana and with Dodi Fayed (pictured together on the night they died) were killed alongside Henri Paul when the car crashed in a Paris tunnel . As well as hiding weapons in his . house, in a 'reign of terror' on his family Soldier N allegedly attacked . his son after mistaking him for the Taliban. His children were also allegedly driven around in the boot of his Land Rover and he had hung his son 30ft above the ground in a tree. The . eight-page correspondence claims Soldier N boasted it was the SAS that . had ‘arranged Princess Diana’s death’ and that it had been ‘covered up’. An inquest in 2008 found that Princess . Diana and Dodi Al Fayed were unlawfully killed due to the ‘gross . negligence’ of driver Henri Paul, a security manager at the Paris Ritz Hotel, who . had been drinking. The jury in the 2008 inquest concluded its verdict as 'unlawful killing, grossly negligent driving of the following vehicles and of the Mercedes', the Met said . Evidence which emerged at the weekend revealed that Soldier N is also accused of saying he . could enlist the help of his colleagues to ensure his wife – the mother . of his two children – would ‘disappear’. The families of Henri Paul and Dodi al Fayed (pictured with Princess Diana) have always believed there was a murder plot . Sergeant . Nightingale, 38, was found guilty last month of illegally possessing a . pistol and ammunition at a Hereford house he shared with Soldier N. Soldier . N, who is serving a custodial sentence for possessing firearms at the . same address, was originally reported to the police by his wife, from . whom he is now separated. The letter was sent to Soldier N’s . commanding officer in September 2011 and passed to the Service . Prosecuting Authority before the start of the Nightingale trial. All references to the SAS were removed by the SPA. The . paragraph referring to the death of Diana says: ‘He also told her (his . wife) that it was the XXX who arranged Princess Diana’s death and that . has been covered up.’ The . letter says Soldier N told his wife there is a ‘box which members of . his unit use for private jobs’. ‘They put in the box the name, address . and details of what they want done and then one of them who wants to . earn extra money does that job.’ When . Soldier N was challenged by his mother-in-law, he is accused of saying: . ‘Let me stop you right there – I kill women and I kill children.’ Scotland Yard confirmed officers from its specialist crime and operations command are assessing information handed to it by the Royal Military Police. Pictured: The couple at the Ritz Hotel before they both died . The . Metropolitan Police has confirmed officers are ‘scoping’ the details of . the new information and ‘assessing its relevance and credibility’. Pleased: The family of Henri Paul (pictured) who was driving Princess Diana when she died have welcomed the news that Scotland Yard are assessing information that she was killed by a SAS soldier . Former member of the Territorial SAS and now Tory MP for Canterbury and Whitstable, Julian Brazier, questioned why the Met have opened a new inquiry based on this evidence. 'I am very surprised by the police decision to start yet another inquiry based only on this extremely indirect testimony,' he said. Henri Paul's mother Gisele . said she believed her son was murdered together with Diana and Mr Al . Fayed when the Mercedes he was driving crashed in an underpass. Mrs Paul, 83, said: ‘We believe there was a plot to kill the Princess that terrible night in August 1997. ‘We know in our hearts that our son was murdered and we still live with the hope that one day the truth will be known.’ The . new information was also welcomed by Dodi’s father, former Harrods . owner Mohamed Al Fayed, who also insists the couple were murdered. He . said he trusted the Metropolitan Police would investigate the new claims . ‘with vigour’. A royal spokesman said there would be no comment from the Duke of Cambridge, Prince Harry or Clarence House.","Soldier N - sniper who made claims - is in jail for hiding guns in his house .

"It has been just two weeks since Darryn Lyons, a former celebrity photographer famous for pink hair and enhanced abs, was elected mayor of his hometown. However his transformation from paparazzi to politician appeared complete yesterday as he shook hands with the country's new Prime Minister, Tony Abbott. He looked particularly dapper in a blue-pinstripe suit and matching silk tie and shirt as he shook Mr Abbot's hand inside Parliament House in Canberra. Former celebrity photographer and newly-elected Mayor Darryn Lyons shook hands with the Austrian Prime Minister yesterday . Mr Lyons met Tony Abbott, Australia's Liberal Party Prime Minister, in Parliament House in Canberra . While he has appeared on reality TV shows, including I'm a Celebrity and Big Brother sporting a signature pink Mohican, that has now been dyed a more officious-looking blonde colour. Mr Lyons posed for pictures with Mr Abbott and also with Liberal MP Sarah Henderson . On November 25th 48-year-old Lyons won the Mayoral post in Geelong taking 29.9 per cent of the primary vote. The Liberal party member took 70,795 votes after preferences, ahead of his nearest challenger Stephanie Asher by more than 12,600 votes. When he announced his intention to run in the Australian state of Victoria he said he had learned from his time living in Britain that 'every election needs a comedy candidate,' reported The Age. His campaign slogan was 'vision, passion and change,' and he publicised his message with adverts, T-shirts, and a stream of public appearances. Mr Lyons was victorious despite the fact he has lived in Europe for several decades - he arrived in London aged 22. In 1992, Lyons founded picture agency Big Pictures, later gaining notoriety for selling a photograph of David Beckham and Rebecca Loos to the News Of The World. In 2011 he appeared on Celebrity Big Brother during which time bragged of his bedroom antics with a series of famous faces. He even claimed to having spent the night with 12 girls at the same time. Lyons also appeared on Chanel 5's Celebrity Big Brother in 2010 alongside Sally Bercow, wife of House of Commons Speaker John Bercow . The paparazzo told model Bobby Sabel: 'I once shared a bed with 12 girls. Those were the crazy days.' On the Channel Five programme in which he came in sixth place, he also debuted his surgically-sculpted six pack. The £4,000 procedure sees fat sucked out of specific areas of the torso to make it look as if the patient has super-toned abdominal muscles without ever hitting the gym. Talking about the procedure, Mr Lyons said: 'I had contouring done to my body. 'I had to get really fit and lose a fair bit of weight. It takes away all the fat around it and actually lets your natural abs be there. 'Basically it's the male version of a boob job.' Big Pictures went into administration last year with a string of debts, leaving 21 of his London-based staff without jobs. But back in Australia Mr Lyons set up Mr Paparazzi Celebrity Deals and established himself as a shareholder of another firm called BPGG Limited – which promptly bought up the assets of Big Pictures from the administrators for £164,000. He appeared at the Leveson Inquiry into media ethics in 2012 and has also appeared on a series of television shows - including the Australian version of Dragons’ Den and an ITV reality series about the magazine business called Deadline.","Darryn Lyons, newly-elected Mayor of Geelong, has met the Australian PM .

But if Wenger is looking for some comfort then he need look no further than United’s away record, they are yet to win on the road this season and have not picked up three points on their travels since April 5 when they beat Newcastle 4-0. In seasons gone by Arsenal vs Manchester United was a game that would often decide the title, but this year’s contest looks more likely to be the battle for fourth and the final Champions League place.

"Gianluigi Buffon and Giorgio Chiellini have extended their contracts with Juventus, keeping them at the Serie A club through 2017 and 2018, respectively. Buffon, who is the captain of Juventus and the Italian national team, will be 39 when his new deal expires and will have spent 16 years as the club's goalkeeper. 'As both parties wished to continue, it was the natural choice to extend my contract for another two years,' said Buffon. Juventus club captain Gianluigi Buffon has signed a contract extension to prolong his career in Turin . Giorgio Chiellini, who joined the reigning Serie A champions in 2005, is set to stay at the Turin club until 2018 . 'The fact that it could be my last contract should be taken into consideration, but it doesn't worry me. I think about the present and then we'll see if the future will give me something unexpected. 'I need energy and courage to make my career last even longer. The praise from the club makes me proud of the choices I made 14 years ago.' Juventus is sure to keep hold of Chiellini at least until the Italy defender is 33, at which time he will have been with the club for 13 years. Buffon and fellow Juventus team-mate Giorgio Chiellini (top row, middle) are still regulars for the national side . 'Being here makes me emotional,' Chiellini said. 'It makes me think back to all the people who helped me grow and become a man in Turin. 'It makes me proud to know that, in years to come, when people talk about Gigi and Giorgio, they'll think of Juventus.'

"Greece have appointed youth coach Kostas Tsanas as their interim manager, but are yet to officially announce the sacking of former Chelsea boss Claudio Ranieri. The country's football federation (EPO) has effectively suspended Ranieri for the time being as both sides work out the financial settlement surrounding his €1.6million (£1.27m) contract. Ranieri, 63, was expected to stay on for Greece's friendly with Serbia in Crete on Tuesday but that is no longer the case. Youth coach Kostas Tsanas has been appointed as interim manager of Greece by the EPO . 'The Hellenic Football Federation announces that the role of interim coach for the friendly match with Serbia with be Kostas Tsanas and Nektarios Pantazis,' EPO said in a brief media statement. EPO chief Giorgos Sarris has made clear their intentions to part company with Ranieri on Saturday following the humiliating 1-0 defeat to the Faroe Islands which left Greece bottom of Euro 2016 qualifying Group F. Ranieri was appointed after the 2014 World Cup, taking over from Portuguese boss Fernando Santos on a two-year deal amid enthusiastic media hype. But the former Chelsea, Juventus and Monaco boss, has failed to live up to his billing, with the Greeks appearing to go backwards after the World Cup. Greek media termed the national team's shock 1-0 home defeat by Faroe Islands as a 'black night' for football in the country.

"Claudio Ranieri has been sacked as Greece coach following their shock 1-0 defeat to the Faroe Islands in a Euro 2016 qualifier on Friday night. Ranieri, who had only been in charge for four months since taking over from former boss Fernando Santos after the 2014 World Cup, leaves Greece rock bottom of Group F following four successive defeats so far. The writing looked to be on the wall for the former Chelsea and Monaco boss after the game, with a statement from Hellenic Football Federation president Giorgos Sarris all about confirming Ranieri would soon be relieved of his duties. Greece coach Claudio Ranieri looks on from the touchline as he watches his side lose to the Faroe Islands . Faroe Islands' Joan Edmudsson (second right) celebrates with his team-mates after scoring against Greece . Sarris said: 'Following today's devastating result for the national team, I take full responsibility for the most unfortunate choice of coach, which has resulted in such a poor image of the national team being put before the fans. 'The governing board will convene and take responsibility among all the members to make the necessary changes needed to avoid a repeat of such an embarrassing night.' The defeat at home to the Faroe Islands, who in turn recorded just their 20th win since beginning international play in 1988, represented a new low. Ranieri turns away as the final whistle goes with the Faroe Islands team celebrating in the background . Greece goalkeeper Orestis Karnezis dives to his right to save the ball as the home side struggle in Piraeus . Joan Edmundsson's 61st minute goal settled the contest in Athens, and earned the Faroe Islands their first competitive victory in three years. The 63-year-old, whose first job in international management was with Greece, took responsibility for the latest setback for the 2004 European Champions after the game, but remained defiant in his post-match press conference.

"With the setting sun just beginning to turn the sky pink, a killer whale leaps out of the ocean and soars into the air, spray cascading down in its wake. It is a magnificent image. Except the whale’s dive has a purpose – the dolphin quivering 15ft below. These astonishing photographs record the final act of a chase that lasted two hours, and ended with the dolphin trapped in the jaws of the eight-ton orca. The dolphin was originally part of a small group swimming off the Mexican coast but the others managed to get away, leaving it at the mercy of a whole pod of whales. Dramatic: This killer whale was pictured attacking a bottlenose dolphin off the Mexican coast . Astonishing: These photographs record the final act of a chase that lasted two hours . Photographer Christopher Swann, who captured the extraordinary scene, said: ‘The killer whales tore round at full speed for two hours. ‘We never knew where to look because they erupted out of the water in one place, disappeared in a thrashing of foam and reappeared in a totally new location. ‘On one occasion the killer whale burst out of the water directly in front of us, and about six or seven metres ahead. 'He was about four metres in the air and heading right at us - I thought he was going to land on the boat but it turned mid-air and clattered into the sea beside us.’ Fortunate: Photographer Christopher Swann captured the extraordinary scene . Hunting: The killer whales raced around after the dolphin at full speed for two hours . The father-of-one, who has been whale watching for more than two decades, said the killer whale in the photograph appeared to do most of the chasing. Mr Swann added: ‘The terror and fight for life of the dolphin was palpable. One felt one could feel the adrenalin in his veins and his pulsing heart as he raced for his life. ‘[He went] back and forth but [was] always met by another whale blocking the way. Sometimes, three or four times, the whales would knock the dolphin out of the water - once with their tail. Gruesome: As darkness fell, the whales had the dolphin on the surface and it was all over . ‘Incredible when you consider that this was a large healthy dolphin. It is staggering how the whales treated it like a plaything. ‘I had the feeling - maybe wrongly of course - the last hour was unnecessary as far as the whales were concerned and that they were just playing with it and then finally, just as darkness fell, they had it on the surface in their midst and it was all over.’","The dolphin was originally part of a .

"The words are full of warmth, hope and comfort. But fortunately for history, the Queen never had to say them. Deep in the corridors of Whitehall at the height of the Cold War civil servants prepared a speech for the monarch to deliver at the outbreak of World War Three between a nuclear-armed Soviet Union and the West. In a chilling depiction of a world on the brink of nuclear destruction, she denounces the ‘deadly power of abused technology’ - and refers to her ‘beloved son Andrew’ on the frontline. However, she rallies her country behind her, declaring in the planned broadcast: ‘Whatever terrors lie in wait for us all the qualities that have helped to keep our freedom intact twice already during this sad century will once more be our strength.’ Duty calls: Civil servants prepared a speech for the Queen, pictured in 1983, to deliver at the outbreak of World War Three . Threat: In the speech the Queen denounces the 'deadly power of abused technology' and refers to her 'beloved son Andrew' on  the frontline . The moving words were written by an imaginative speech writer taking part in a disaster planning exercise and are among previously secret Cabinet files newly released by the National Archives. The writer envisages the Queen saying: ‘Not for a single moment did I imagine that this solemn and awful duty would one day fall to me.’ It continues: ‘We all know that the dangers facing us today are greater by far than at any time in our long history.’ The disaster planning meeting, known as the Cabinet Wintex-Cimex 83 Committee exercise, came in the spring of 1983 against a backdrop of worsening US-Russian relations and tit-for-tat battles on each side. It was the year that US President Ronald Reagan described the Soviets as the ‘evil empire’, deployed medium-range nuclear missiles to Europe and began the Star Wars project. Message to the Nation: The speech prepared for the Queen in the event of the outbreak of World War Three . A Nato military exercise codenamed Able Archer nearly led to actual war when the Soviet Union became convinced it was a genuine attack. The Queen’s words were imagined to be broadcast at noon on Friday, March 4, 1983. In the exercise, Orange (the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies) launch a chemical weapons attack on Britain. The Blue forces (Nato) respond with a ‘limited yield’ nuclear strike forcing the Orange bloc to offer peace. The civil servants even thought up what the Prime Minister would say. A participant writes a speech for Margaret Thatcher saying: ‘We wanted peace and strove to achieve it. ‘We are the victims of an unprovoked attack and, with our allies, we will fight back.’ Text of the 1983 message to the nation written for Her Majesty the Queen... but never delivered . When I spoke to you less than three months ago we were all enjoying the warmth and fellowship of a family Christmas. Our thoughts were concentrated on the strong links that bind each generation to the ones that came before and those that will follow. The horrors of war could not have seemed more remote as my family and I shared our Christmas joy with the growing family of the Commonwealth. Now this madness of war is once more spreading through the world and our brave country must again prepare itself to survive against great odds. I have never forgotten the sorrow and pride I felt as my sister and I huddled around the nursery wireless set listening to my father’s inspiring words on that fateful day in 1939. Not for a single moment did I imagine that this solemn and awful duty would one day fall to me. We all know that the dangers facing us today are greater by far than at any time in our long history. The enemy is not the soldier with his rifle nor even the airman prowling the skies above our cities and towns but the deadly power of abused technology. But whatever terrors lie in wait for us all the qualities that have helped to keep our freedom intact twice already during this sad century will once more be our strength. My husband and I share with families up and down the land the fear we feel for sons and daughters, husbands and brothers who have left our side to serve their country. My beloved son Andrew is at this moment in action with his unit and we pray continually for his safety and for the safety of all servicemen and women at home and overseas. It is this close bond of family life that must be our greatest defence against the unknown. If families remain united and resolute, giving shelter to those living alone and unprotected, our country’s will to survive cannot be broken. My message to you therefore is simple. Help those who cannot help themselves, give comfort to the lonely and the homeless and let your family become the focus of hope and life to those who need it. As we strive together to fight off the new evil let us pray for our country and men of goodwill wherever they may be. God bless you all. Britain was ready to use lasers to ‘dazzle’ Argentine pilots attacking British ships during the 1982 Falklands War. A top-secret document describing the new weapon was produced after a request from Mrs Thatcher, files just released from the National Archives show. Dated January 1983 and written by then Defence Secretary Michael Heseltine, it explained that Britain, spurred on by Russia’s adoption of laser technology, had developed its own arsenal. ‘You may recall that we developed and deployed with very great urgency a naval laser weapon, designed to dazzle low-flying Argentine pilots attacking ships, to the Task Force in the South Atlantic,’ the document said. ‘This weapon was not used in action and knowledge of it has been kept to a very restricted level.’","Speech was prepared for Queen to deliver at outbreak of World War Three .

"David Cameron was last night  mocked for his ‘endless ego’ after  paying to win friends on Facebook. Tory Party chiefs have spent thousands on advertisements on the social media site to encourage users to ‘like’ the Prime Minister’s page. And the strategy has worked.

Prime Minister David Cameron has been mocked for his 'endless ego' after paying to win Facebook 'likes' Facebook would not reveal details of the advertising deal, but marketing experts say the campaign would have cost about £7,500 of party funds. The bill is based on results, up to an agreed maximum, with Facebook charging about 50p per ‘like’. Labour MP Sheila Gilmore said: ‘It looks as if David Cameron is buying popularity. There is no end to his ego, paying for fake Facebook friends.’ And a Lib Dem insider dismissed the strategy as ‘pretty pathetic’. Facebook would not reveal details of the advertising deal, but marketing experts say the campaign would have cost about £7,500 of party funds . But the Tories said such campaigns were ‘above board’ and ‘common practice’ among businesses and American presidential candidates.

"There is an unlikely corner of England that is forever North Korea. To get there, turn left out of Acton Town Tube station, right at the BP garage and walk past the cricket ground, but not quite as far as the mock-Tudor semi with the blue plaque where Carry On star Sid James lived. The UK embassy of the world’s most oppressive regime is the bay-windowed Twenties house on the corner of Gunnersbury Avenue and Baronsmede. The one with the curtains and blinds permanently drawn. A little piece of Pyongyang in Ealing, West London. Quitting London? The seven-bedroom ordinary home that is the North Korean embassy where ambassador Hyon Hak Bong lives . Even with a 40ft flagpost, it is barely distinguishable from all the other houses in the area. Any one of them could provide the backdrop to a Seventies suburban sitcom; in fact The Fall And Rise Of Reginald Perrin was filmed just down the road. One might expect this curious diplomatic mission – it doubles as the residence of North Korea’s ambassador Hyon Hak Bong – to be a blur of activity. After all, the Supreme Leader’s twitchy finger appears to edge closer to the nuclear button by the day. True, Bong is said to be more ‘unavailable’ than normal. But it was business as usual for everyone else. On Friday his wife went out shopping. Honour: Hyon Hak Bong, the North Korean ambassador, presents his credentials to the Queen in a private audience at Buckingham Palace last year . There was one thing, though. Notices pinned to the 7ft-high garden wall warn residents not to park outside it on Tuesday April 9, when ‘loading work will take place’. No one knows what work is due, but Kim Jong-un has warned the Russian and British embassies in Pyongyang to evacuate their staff ‘in the event of conflict from April 10’. Could it mean Bong and his team intend to scarper the day before things turn nasty? Or perhaps the embassy is taking delivery of a deadly missile launcher? Farce: Sid James lived down the same street and there is a blue plaque on the property he used to live in . A diplomat in a dark shirt wasn’t in the mood to enlighten The Mail on Sunday when approached at the edge of the embassy’s driveway, where two blue Mercedes were parked. The reporter’s outstretched hand was eyed suspiciously before he shook it. Could we speak to the ambassador? ‘No,’ came the firm reply. How about the press attaché? ‘No.’ But one of the neighbours said they were nice people. ‘We had some of the diplomats round for a drink once,’ he said. ‘They told us they love England. ‘But I suppose that’s no surprise coming from North Korea, is it? One of them said he was a big fan of The X Factor.’ Danger: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has repeatedly ramped up the rhetoric in recent weeks threatening a military strike .","North Korean embassy is based near Acton Town tube station in a bay-windowed 1920s home .

"Astronomers have found a planet which is one of the best candidates for life ever found by telescopes on Earth. The planet is rocky, like ours, and orbits its sun within the 'habitable zone', where temperatures are just right for liquid water to exist on the planet's surface. The temperature on the surface could be close to Earth's. 'This planet is the new best candidate to support liquid . water and, perhaps, life as we know it,' study leader Guillem Anglada-Escudé said. The Princeton scientists suggest that it's likely that Earth is a one-off - and that life may not have evolved anywhere else . One of the recent 'earth-like' planets discovered by Nasa - but a new Princeton study suggests that Earth alone may play host to life . The planet was detected using data from the European Southern Observatory's telescopes, which was analysed to look for 'wobbles' in a star's motion caused the gravitational 'tug' of planets orbiting it. The new planet has a mass around 4.5 times the Earth, and orbits a star called GJ 667C, 22 light years from Earth - just next door, in galactic terms. The new planet absorbs around the same amount of light as our planet. 'This was expected to be a rather . unlikely star to host planets. Yet there they are, around a very nearby, . metal-poor example of the most common type of star in our galaxy,' said Steven Vogt, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC. 'The planet is around one star in a triple-star system. The other stars are pretty far away, but they would look pretty nice in the sky.' 'The detection . of this planet, this nearby and this soon, implies that our galaxy must . be teeming with billions of potentially habitable rocky planets.' The European Southern Observatory, La Silla Paranal, Chile, South America: The planet was detected using data from the ESO's telescopes, which was analysed to look for 'wobbles' in a star's motion caused the gravitational 'tug' of planets orbiting it . 'With the advent of a new generation of . instruments, researchers will be able to survey many M dwarf stars for . similar planets and eventually look for signatures of life . in one of these worlds,' said Anglada-Escudé. The host star is a member of a system with three stars - the other two are orange dwarf planets. The star has a different chemical makeup than our Sun, with a much lower abundance of elements heavier than helium, such as iron, carbon, and silicon. This discovery indicates that potentially habitable planets can occur in a greater variety of environments than previously believed. GJ 667C had previously been observed to have a large planet orbiting close to its star, although this finding was never published. This planet orbits so close to the star that it would be too hot for liquid water. The new study started with the aim of obtaining the orbital parameters of this super-Earth.But in addition to this first candidate, the research team found the clear signal of the new planet (GJ 667Cc. The team found that the system might also contain a gas-giant planet and an additional super-Earth. However, further observations are needed to confirm these two possibilities.","Planet orbits star 22 light years from Earth .

"Binmen have been banned from carrying rubbish bags just 60 yards to their lorries for 'health and safety' reasons. Council officials have ordered that the bags left in a residential square in Canterbury, Kent, should only be picked up if the rubbish truck could drive directly to them.

It comes after householders complained some of their rubbish was going uncollected. Local Labour councillor Alan Baldock said the edict was ‘a complete c**k- up’. He said: 'How is it all right for an old person to carry their bin bags to somewhere else and not all right for a binman to do the same? 'That seems bizarre and contradictory. 'Why don’t they just send a smaller truck round? 'Instead, we’ve got rubbish going uncollected. It’s a disgrace and another example that this council’s bin collection system is not fit for purpose.' Roads affected by the rules include the city’s Notley Street, Clyde Street and Alma Street which form a square.

"A 23-year-old black man has been charged in the grisly murder of a 67-year-old white supremacist in Brandon, Mississippi. Vincent McGee, an ex-convict, pleaded guilty to manslaughter, arson and burglary charges in connection with the murder of Richard Barrett in rural Mississippi in April 2010. Mr McGee, who had originally been charged with capital murder, maintained that Mr Barrett had made sexual advances towards him. He had also told the media, shortly after Mr Barrett’s death, that he was unaware of the man’s white supremacist views. Vincent McGee has pleaded guilty to manslaughter, arson, and burglary in connection with the murder of white supremacist Richard Barrett . Mr Barrett, whose body was found beaten, burned, and stabbed 16 times, was the outspoken founder of a Mississippi-based segregationist group named the Nationalist Movement and ran a school for skinheads. He travelled the country promoting his views. Authorities say that Mr McGee, who had burns covering 35 per cent of his body, set a fire in order to conceal the murder. Mr McGee, who had been held without bond since his arrest days after the murder, was sentenced to 65 years in prison by Circuit Judge William Chapman. The sentence includes 20 years for manslaughter, 20 years for arson, and 25 years for burglary. 'It is highly unlikely,’ said district attorney Michael Guest, that ‘Mr. McGee will ever leave the penitentiary.’ Richard Barrett, a 67-year-old white supremacist who ran a school for skinheads, was killed in his Mississippi home last April . Mr McGee lived on the same road as Mr Barrett. Mr McGee’s mother told authorities that her family was acquainted with the victim, and that he had socialized at their home for an hour on the night of his death. Mr McGee and prosecutors did not agree as to why Mr Barrett had been killed. Though he provided inconsistent answers as why he went to Mr Barrett's house the day of the killing, Mr McGee did maintain that Mr Barrett made sexual advances. In one statement, he claimed that he had gone to Mr Barrett’s house to use his computer on the day of the killing. In another statement, Mr McGee claimed he went to the home to collect payment owed for yard work. He also said that he had hit and stabbed Mr Barrett after he had taken down his pants and asked for a sex act. Shortly after the murder, however, the district attorney said that robbery was a motive and that Mr McGee had some of Mr Barrett's possessions, including a pistol and a wallet. The case did not produce evidence that the crime was related to Mr Barrett’s white supremacist views. The prosecution charged Mr McGee as a habitual offender, noting previous crimes including assaulting a police officer, grand larceny and a parole violation. The district attorney said that movement toward a guilty plea came earlier this week. However, the agreement wasn't made until late Wednesday, when his staff decided to accept the plea if Mr McGee agreed to maximum sentences on each of the three charges.","Richard Barrett was beaten, burned and stabbed 16 times .

"New Hibernian boss Alan Stubbs has warned Rangers they won’t enjoy an easy passage back to Scottish football’s top flight. The former Celtic defender, who Sportsmail understands is close to appointing former Everton coach Andy Holden as his No2, is facing up to the task of rebuilding a squad of just 15 senior players following the club’s relegation. But he claims he has the resources to give Rangers and Hearts a run for their money in a cut-throat battle for promotion to the SPFL Premiership. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Rangers players get shocked by thundering and lightning . New boy: Alan Stubbs was unveiled as Hibernian manager and is seeking automatic promotion . Aim: Stubbs wants to give Rangers and Hearts a run for their money in a cut-throat battle for promotion . ‘If you’re going on budgets then Rangers are favourites,’ said Stubbs. ‘But I’ve been around the block in football and you realise that’s not the be all and end all. ‘Our budget will be competitive for the league we’re in and we expect to give Rangers, Hearts and all the teams in the division a tough time. ‘It’s foolish to say it’s all about Rangers, Hibs and Hearts because it’s disrespectful to the  others. ‘It’s going to be a tough league - there’s no way we thought we were going to be in this league, but we are. ‘There’s no way Rangers thought they would be here and playing Hearts and Hibs this year in order to get up either. But those who think it’s a foregone conclusion are mistaken.’ An Old Firm foe of Ally McCoist during his time at Parkhead, Stubbs, 42, is relishing the thought of locking horns once more. ‘We’ve come across each other a few times, more out in Glasgow than anything. ‘I’ve . had conversations with Coisty a few times and we’ve met at coaching . events and games so there will be a bit of banter on the sidelines - but . most of all there will be a respect.’ As . he fields calls from agents for players Stubbs is also seeking to firm . up the appointment of an assistant. Former Welsh international Holden, . 51, is the man he wants after ex-Everton colleague David Unsworth opted . to stay put.

Announcing bookmakers Marathonbet as the new club sponsor in a six-figure deal, Dempster insisted she had been tracking the progress of Stubbs for some time. Former Falkirk managing director George Craig will help Stubbs out in a director of football type role and Dempster insists the cash is there to rebuild a squad decimated by the axing of 12 players. ‘We are in the Championship, so there is a reality in terms of the income we can generate but we will have a good budget in this division in comparison to the competitors,’ she said. ‘I won’t make the budget public, but it is strong and there is money to bring players in. It is up to us to spend wisely and be absolutely committed to getting the right players in. ‘But today is not about talking about money, it’s about introducing Alan to the supporters at large - looking forward rather than backwards.’ Discussions: Stubbs and Chief Executive Leeann Dempster (left) will talk about who will be his No.2 .

"CLICK HERE to read Jeff Powell's exclusive on the night Kell Brook was stabbed . For a man who four months ago had a machete embedded in his left thigh, Kell Brook has no plans to tread slowly now that he has reclaimed his future in boxing. There was certainly an air of impatience around Sheffield’s world champion yesterday as he set about the challenge of making up for lost time, starting with his ring comeback on March 28 and moving on, you sense, to a future date with Amir Khan. The particulars are that he will defend his IBF welterweight title for the first time at Sheffield Arena against Jo Jo Dan, the Canadian-based Romanian who is mandatory challenger for a belt Brook won only weeks before he was viciously assaulted in Tenerife. Brook will defend his IBF welterweight title for the first time since winning it last year . Brook attends a press conference to confirm his next fight against Jo Jo Dan on March 28 . The world welterweight champion was forced to delay the fight after being stabbed in the leg while on holiday . The British boxer is already looking ahead to a big money fight with either Amir Khan or Floyd Mayweather . The fascination of this fight will be learning how much Brook has been affected, in a physical sense, by that brutal episode last September. Quite aside from the blood transfusion that helped save his life, Brook needed more than 60 stitches to piece two deeply cut muscles together again. Speaking to Sportsmail nine days after the assault, he admitted there was no feeling at all around the wound. He went on to say that the surgeon had told him the sensations might never return, so it is against that backdrop that Brook’s comeback must be judged. Will the wonderfully talented 28-year-old still have the speed and movement that contributed so much to his 33 wins from 33 fights? That is what should be discovered from a reasonably tough assignment against a challenger who has won 34 fights and lost only two. Kell Brook will return to the ring  after he was stabbed in the leg while on holiday in Tenerife . Brook said he was the 'victim of an unprovoked attack' when on holiday  in September . Only after his title defence will it be possible to judge if he could still mix with Khan, in the event that Brook’s management succeed in luring the Bolton man to a fight. ‘It was the lowest part of my career,’ said Brook yesterday, as he announced his first fight since he won the world title from Shawn Porter in California last August. ‘I went from winning the world title and being on cloud nine to being on the bottom of the ocean, lying on that hospital bed. I was wondering if I would walk again, never mind fight. I did not know. ‘But now I am great, very fit and healthy. My leg is bang on, fine and I’ve worked hard. ‘It will be emotional. I can’t wait to get in and defend my world title among the Sheffield fans and in Great Britain. I am undefeated and that is how I mean to go on.’ The 28-year-old recalls the fateful night in an exclusive interview with Sportsmail's Jeff Powell . Brook rests at home while he recovered in the company of his pet dog . Of Dan, Brook added: ‘He is No 1 contender for the title and a very tough customer. He comes to fight southpaw, he’s awkward and I’ll have to work hard. I’ll have my work cut out.’ While the mere occurrence of this bout represents a victory for Brook, the bigger picture calls for a fight with Khan. Sportsmail revealed in the aftermath of Brook’s world-title win that his promoter, Eddie Hearn, had eyes on a Wembley date. The two men have long disliked one another, with Khan of the opinion that he belongs in a higher category of fighter. The truth of the matter is that Brook holds the belt and with it has a handsome bargaining chip, not least because Khan looks no closer to securing a fight with Floyd Mayweather. Hearn told Sportsmail this week: ‘I offered Khan $5million to take the fight before Kell won a world title. With a world title involved, the pot of money for this fight is even bigger. If Khan truly thinks he could beat Kell, then he should step up. Brook won the IBF world welterweight title when he beat Shawn Porter in Los Angeles in August . The world welterweight champion training before . ‘I would back Kell every day of the week to win that fight. We are more than happy to have a 60-40 for the winner or 70-30 for the winner. In fact, how about winner takes all? It’s big balls time.’ For his part, Brook said yesterday: ‘I want the hardest fights, the massive fights for the summer, to fill an arena, a massive stadium. ‘We are looking at the biggest names. Names like Juan Manuel Marquez, and Marcos Maidana. Maybe the kid from Bolton (Khan), if he wants to do it. I am ready. ‘But don’t get me wrong, Jo Jo Dan is no walkover. He is a tough customer and he is coming to fight hard.’ That should not be a major problem compared to what Brook has already encountered.","Kell Brook defends his IBF welterweight title for the first time on March 28 .

Fullerton, who appeared on Strictly last year, added on Twitter . yesterday: ‘They are cypress leylandii which are wrong for the area.’ The former Bond girl, who starred as a KGB spy in 1985 film A View to a . Kill alongside Roger Moore, is now described as a ‘property queen’. She . has a ‘small portfolio’ of flats, houses and offices in London and . Oxford and has written books with titles like How to Make Money From . Your Property. Sarah Knightly Brown, pictured, who has lived alongside the star's home in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, for 30 years,  dubbed the trees 'iconic' But she denies that her current project in Cheltenham was about making a quick buck, insisting: ‘It’s going to be our home.’ Sarah . Knightly Brown, who has lived near the property for 30 years, described . the trees as ‘iconic’. She said: ‘The greenery of this area is what . makes it so special. If you look at this road, the old trees are so . important to the way it looks. Refute: Ms Fuller flatly denied this project was about making a quick profit . Felling them will change the whole . atmosphere. A lot of residents feel very strongly about this. We don’t . want these trees to go. They are iconic and have been there ever since I . moved in.’ Peter Swales, . chairman of Cheltenham Bridge Club, who also lives by the property, . added: ‘Felling these trees basically amounts to vandalism. It’s just . property developers making some cash without a care for the community.’ Lindsey Mulraine, tree officer at Cheltenham Borough Council, said the . cypresses had ‘reached the end of their useful life’. She added: ‘It is a . shame to lose these two trees, but it was felt they were not worthy of a . preservation order. ‘We did publicise the proposed works and no objections were received.’ Twice . married Miss Fullerton sold her previous £2.5million home in the . Cotswolds because she couldn’t face living in an ‘empty nest’ with no . children, she explained last year.","The View To A Kill star has caused uproar in her community over the trees .

"Thieves dug a 50ft tunnel under a building to steal thousands of pounds from a cash machine. Police believe the gang spent months digging the 'complex' structure from nearby wasteland to get at the cash at a Tesco store in Eccles, Greater Manchester last Friday, March 14. The elaborate heist has been linked to the so-called 'mole-in-the-wall' gang, who are believed to have carried out three similar plots in the city since 2007. Scroll down for video . Police think the gang spent months digging the 50ft tunnel before carrying out a raid on Tesco in Eccles, Greater Manchester . A substantial amount of money was stolen from the supermarket after the gang tunnelled their way in from a nearby wasteland . In the latest raid, thieves stole cash boxes containing a 'substantial' sum of money from the Tesco store in Liverpool Road before disappearing back through the tunnel with the cash, Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said. A police spokesman confirmed that the amount taken was in the 'tens of thousands of pounds'. Officers said they believe the gang may have spent months digging the tunnel, because of the amount of planning that was involved and complex nature of the tunnel structure. GMP's Detective Superintendent Mark Toker said: 'These people had obviously spent a long time plotting this crime and I doubt they would have been able to keep their plans secret for all that time, without telling others about their elaborate scheme. 'The offenders must have spent long periods of time in the area over the last few months, which people may have noticed. Police have described the tunnel used in the late-night raid as a 'complex structure' Thousands of pounds were taken from the Tesco Express store in Liverpool Road, Eccles in the tunnel heist . Out of order: The cashpoint, situated on an external wall of the shop, was not working today after thieves dug under it to get to the money . 'You may have seen people acting suspiciously on Friday night, possibly covered in soil. 'I would ask anyone with any information about the robbery to call us as soon as possible.' It is thought to be the fourth time in seven years the same 'tunnel' method has been used in an attempt to steal cash machines from across the Greater Manchester area. In August 2007, thieves dug under a Blockbusters store at Fallowfield shopping precinct in Manchester in a bid to steal an ATM, only to be foiled when contractors stumbled upon their tunnel while laying electric cables. As well as scaffolding and wooden poles to shore up that tunnel, and electric lighting to dig by, police found tools, shovels, a wheelbarrow and bags of soil and what appeared to be a ventilation system. It was later filled in with concrete to prevent re-use. The latest raid has been linked to previous attempts by the so-called 'mole-in-the-wall' gang, who tunnelled from a railway embankment (pictured) towards a corner shop in 2012 . It is believed a similar system of supports and scaffolding as used in previous raids (pictured) were used in the latest theft . The entrance to a previous tunnel dug behind the Blockbuster store in Fallowfield, Manchester in a similar theft . In January 2012, around £6,000 from the same ATM was stolen after thieves dug a 100ft tunnel. Again, it emerged the gang had used shovels, a wheelbarrow and then scaffolding to shore the tunnel up before getting inside the building. After security guards discovered that the cash machine was empty, police examined the building and found the tunnel dug from a railway embankment, under a car park and beneath the foundations of the shop. That passageway was around 100ft in length and around 4ft tall and could have taken up to six months to dig. It had also been fitted with lighting and roof supports. Just a month later, in February 2012, a gang dug down from behind a railway station platform in an attempt to snatch an ATM from a corner shop in Manchester's Burnage district. They were foiled after vibrations of their late night digging triggered the shop's security alarm. It is not believed any arrests were made over the previous raids. Police have refused to say whether they are linking the latest tunnel to other similar attempts in the past. At the scene today, there was no police tape to mark the spot where the gang began their dig - only a sign to say that the cash machine was not in use. Staff at the shop refused to comment. The wasteland where the tunnel was started is an overgrown former coach and lorry park, left empty for several years, according to locals, and surrounded by industrial units. The six-foot entrance gate to the yard is locked - but there are several holes in the fence allowing access to the land next to the supermarket. A workman at the nearby Worsley Cruise Club said no suspicious acitivity had been reported by any of the boat owners who use moorings there. Anyone with information about the latest raid is asked to call police on 0161 856 5353 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.","Gang dug beneath a Tesco in Greater Manchester in carefully-planned heist .

"A giant prehistoric ‘terror bird’ - once thought to have been a ruthless predator which snapped the necks of mammals with its enormous beak - was actually a vegetarian, according to a new study. The two-metre gastornis was a flightless creature which lived in Europe between 40 and 55 million years ago. Because of its size and ominous appearance, it was thought to be a top carnivore, the Goldschmidt conference in Florence was told. Dr Thomas Tütken (right), from the University of Bonn, said: 'The 'terror bird' was thought to have used its huge beak to grab and break the neck of its prey.' The fossilised remains of the Gastornis (mock-up pictured left) that were studied were found in a former open cast coal mine . But now a team of German researchers, who studied fossilised remains of the beasts found in a former open cast coal mine, say they believe it was actually not a meat eater. Dr Thomas Tütken, of the University of Bonn, said: 'The terror bird was thought to have used its huge beak to grab and break the neck of its prey, which is supported by biomechanical modelling of its bite force. 'It lived after the dinosaurs became extinct and at a time when mammals were at an early stage of evolution and relatively small; thus, the terror bird was though to have been a top predator at that time on land.' But recent research cast doubt on its fearsome reputation. Palaeontologists in the U.S. found footprints believed to belong to the American cousin of gastornis, and these do not show the imprints of sharp claws, used to grapple prey, that might be expected of a raptor. Palaeontologists in the U.S. found footprints believed to belong to the American cousin of gastornis (gastornis pictured), and these do not show the imprints of sharp claws used to grapple prey, that might be expected of a raptor . Some paleontologists even suggested the gastornis hunted small horses (mock-up pictured). The reality is that it was probably far too heavy to chase such mammals and instead lived off a diet of plants and maybe nuts and seeds . Also, the bird’s sheer size and inability to move fast made some believe it couldn’t have preyed on early mammals - though others claim it might have ambushed them. The gastornis was around two metres tall and weight several hundred pounds. It was named after Gaston Planté who found the first remains. The bird was one of the largest animals alive during the late Paleocene-Middle Eocene period. Until now many experts believed that the creature was a silent ambush hunter in the thick forests that ate prey such as small horses. gastornis fossils are common at the Geiseltal site in Germany, and in the USA. Dr Tütken and his colleagues took a new approach to determine the diet of gastornis, and by analysing the calcium isotope composition in fossilised bones, they were able to identify what proportion of the creature’s diet was plant or animal, and its position in the food chain. This relies on the calcium isotope becoming lighter as it passes through the food chain. Scientists analysed the isotopes of known predators, including T-Rex, herbivores, and mammals living today. They then compared these to those of the terror bird. Their results showed that the calcium isotope compositions of terror bird bones are similar to those of herbivorous mammals and dinosaurs and not carnivorous ones. But researchers want to cross check their data using other fossil assemblages before confirming their findings. The creature was thought to a feasome animal than used its beak to maul prey and fight off competition (mock-up pictured). The gastornis lived after the dinosaurs became extinct and at a time when mammals were at an early stage of evolution . Dr Tütken and his colleagues took a new approach to determine the diet of gastornis (pictured), and by analysing the calcium isotope composition in fossilised bones, they were able to identify what proportion of the creature¿s diet was plant or animal, and its position in the food chain. Dr Tütken said: “Tooth enamel preserves original geochemical signatures much better than bone, but since gastornis didn’t have any teeth, we’ve had to work with their bones to do our calcium isotope assay. 'Because calcium is a major proportion of bone - around 40% by weight - its composition is unlikely to have been affected much by fossilisation. However, we want to be absolutely confident in our findings by analysing known herbivores and carnivores using fossilised bone from the same site and the same time period. This will give us an appropriate reference frame for the terror bird values.'","The two-metre gastornis was a flightless creature that lived in Europe between 40 and 55 million years ago .

"A tangled web of tweets, texts and emails has emerged after a young woman claimed to have incriminating photographs of newlywed quarterback Robert Griffin III. Meredith Barber, a Virginia Commonwealth University student and former Hooters waitress, has offered to sell the photographs, including one of Griffin allegedly exposing his penis, to a sports and gossip website. The story began on Friday when Busted Coverage received an email from 'Brandon K', who had done a bit of Twitter sleuthing and discovered something fishy going on between Griffin, a young woman called Meredith Barber and William Mallow, one of Griffin's groomsmen, dating to the night of Griffin's wedding to Rebecca Liddicoat. Busted: The BustedCoverage.com site has published images of Barber and screen shots of her correspondence with the site trying to sell 'inappropriate' images of Robert Griffin III . Player: Griffin plays for the Washington Redskins . 'So I was looking through RGIII’s Twitter feed the night of his wedding,' Brandon K told the website. He explains that he followed Griffin's retweets to William Mallow's account. On Mallow's Twitter feed, he found a retweet written by someone called @Mere. 'She looked hot so I looked at her feed,' said Brandon K. 'That night one of her friends tweeted 'RG III getting married today. Will @Mere__ crash the wedding?' Twit: Barber published a screenshot of a man she claims is Robert Griffin III on Twitter (re-published by Busted Coverage) Committed: Griffin and Liddicoat were married almost two weeks ago . Brandon K says @Mere__ allegedly responds with, . 'I could show Becky this though,' posted with a picture from her cell . phone of a man lifting up his shirt. 'Come on bae,' the Washington Redskins quarterback allegedly wrote to Barber before sending the image, accompanied by a blushing smiley icon. He then allegedly sent her the photo of his bare stomach muscles but the photo cuts off before his head. When Barber didn't respond, he wrote, “Well ok I give up I guess. See you in a few weeks kid.” The exchange is dated 1am July 6 - the early hours of RG III's wedding day. Wedding day: Robert Griffin III had allegedly been texting Meredith Barber images of his naked torso in the early morning hours before his wedding day . Groomsmen: Griffin is pictured here with his groomsmen, including William Mallow (far right) who has spoken up in defense of his friend . After Busted Coverage went live with that story, they were contacted by Meredith Barber herself. She asked the site to take down the story, and in exchange, she'd sell them 'inappropriate pictures,' as well as screenshots of chats and texts. As proof, she emailed the site a photo of a shirtless man (again cut off before his head) she claims is Griffin and promised there are more, allegedly including 'one with his d*** out.' Barber allegedly told the site's editor, Joe Kinsey, that she would give him full access to the story if he would make her anonymous, for the sake of her 'reputation and family'. What Kinsey actually did was publish his entire exchange with Barber on the site. Barber repeatedly asks Kinsey to give her an idea of how much he'll pay her for the photographs and screenshots. 'Just give me an offer,' she purportedly writes. 'Or I will shop it around.' Newlyweds: Griffin pictured in 2012 with his now-wife, Rebecca Liddicoat . College sweethearts: Griffin and Liddicoat met while they were both attending Baylor University . When Kinsey tells her he can pay $500 for the images, she tells him the figure is 'nowhere near' what she's after and cuts off communication. Around the same time, Dead Spin received an email from someone claiming to be Meredith's ex-boyfriend. The 'ex-boyfriend' offered to sell the site 'information, text messages, FaceTime screenshots, pictures, you name it, proving that it was indeed him and he's been up to it for some time.' He also claimed to have images of the football star's penis and demanded $25,000 for the material. The site declined his offer, but noted that the wording and tone of the 'ex-boyfriend' was very similar to that of Meredith Barber. Next, Joe Kinsey at Busted Coverage received an email from Mallow, the friend and groomsman of Griffin who appears to be the connection between Griffin and Barber. His correspondence is duly published on Busted Coverage, too. Silent: Griffin, who is in Europe on his honeymoon, has not commented on the scandal . Mallow says that Barber is only after money and that her story is false. 'We . both know that Meredith is looking for attention/money. I know this is . what you do for a living and you thought that this would be a golden . opportunity but the fact of the matter is that this is completely . false,' he writes. 'I . was with Robert the night in question, and there was zero texting of . other girls, much less selfie stomach shots. That isn’t even close to . what the bathroom of the suite we were in looked like,' reads the . missive and includes screen shots of a text exchange Mallow had with . Barber in which she claims someone took her phone and wrote the emails. Up until now, 23-year-old Washington Redskins quarterback Griffin has enjoyed a squeaky-clean image. His successes both on and off the field are numerous. He has endorsement deals from companies such as Adidas, Castrol Motor Oil, EA Sports, EvoShield, Gatorade, Nissan, and Subway. According to ESPN's Dollars blog, Griffin has 'earned more than any other rookie in NFL history before throwing his first regular-season pass,' largely as a result of endorsements. His recent marriage to long-time girlfriend Rebecca Liddicoat took place in Denver, Colorado.","A young woman claims to have been sent 'inappropriate pictures' of Robert Griffin III .

"Famous graffiti artist Banksy has become so popular in New York that many locals are flocking to get tattoos inspired by his work as the artist's residency in the Big Apple comes to an end. Tattooist Miykey Kwasnik, 39, from New York Hardcore Tattoo, Manhattan, said he has been swamped with Banksy requests during the artist's month-long residency. The illusive graffiti artist, originally from Bristol, has been posting photos of his New York City works every day for the last month. Banksy boom: New Yorkers are rushing to get Banksy-inspired tattoos, including this image which appeared on a Coney Island wall, as the illusive artist finishes his month-long residency in the city . Illusive art: Banksy posted pictures of his works in New City every day of his month-long residency . Popular requests include the robot spray painting a barcode which featured on a Coney Island wall, and an image of a cleaner wiping away quote ‘What we do in life echoes in Eternity’ from the movie Gladiator, which has appeared in Queens. The most popular are the timeless Banksy images of a girl floating away on balloon and a soldier throwing flowers. During his New York residency, several of his pieces have been quickly defaced by other taggers or business owners. Armed with Banksy: Both timeless artwork and ones created during Banksy's residency (such as this one) have inspired many New Yorkers to get tattoos . Inspiring ink: This artwork, with the quote 'We we do in life echoes in Eternity' from the movie Gladiator, appeared on a wall in Queens during Banksy's residency .

Generally those who get tattoos of street artists, like Banksy, . keep their dedication true to the artists' piece. ‘I'm a big fan of Banksy's work and message -- he is a true visionary and I'd shake his hand if I ever have the honour of meeting this person. ‘I hear a lot of negativity and . jealously projected at the Banksy project, but they all understand it's . making a difference. Never thought I'd see the day that what was once . considered vandalism is now admired as art and categorised as “street . art”.

"Hace n . They are already among the most feared predators ever to have roams the planet. But researchers now believe that tyrannosaurs hunted in packs - which researchers have dubbed 'a terror'. They discovered footprints of tree of the mega-predators in Canada, show them mid-hunt. The fearsome T-Rex: researcher now say the animal hunted in packs. A recent study suggests that the fearsome dinosaur's walk was hip driven. T-Rex lived during the Late Cretaceous period - 66million years ago. While most people think the carnivorous dinosaur stood upright, it had a bird-like posture and kept its tail in the air and its head pitched forward. Its massive skull was balanced by its heavy tail, which was around 15 per cent of its body mass. The creature would have changed direction slowly because if its massive inertia but was agile enough to run. T-Rex had a top speed of 25mph (40kmp) which is a little slower than a horse. The ferocious beasts may have 'stuck together as a pack to increase their chances of bringing down prey and individually surviving,' study co-author Richard McCrea, a curator at the Peace Region Palaeontology Center in Canada, told Livescience. Once believed to be solitary creatures, evidence has grown that tyrannosaurs were more 'gregarious' than thought, according to McCrea's study published in the scientific journal PLOS One. And the fossils are close to perfect, McCrea said. The surface the animals trod was 'pretty much the consistency of Play-Doh,' he said, with a very high clay content. That was then covered by a thick layer of volcanic ash. Conditions were so ideal that impressions of the dinosaurs' rough skin are clearly visible. 'This is the most ideal situation you could almost ask for,' he told the Prince George Citizen. On the run: Researchers discovered footprints of tree of the mega-predators in Canada, showing them mid-hunt. From the size of the footprints, the researchers put the beasts in their late 20s or early 30s . The team eventually discovered a patch 197 feet (60 meters) long by 13 feet (4 m) wide filled with footprints from multiple dinosaurs, including tyrannosaurs, other small theropods, and duck-billed dinosaurs called hadrosaurs. The used 3D modelling to show exactly how the animals walked . 'One trackway consists of three tridactyl footprints, and two adjacent trackways consist of two footprints each, the researchers wrote. 'All three trackways show animals bearing southeast within an 8.5 meter-wide corridor. 'Similarities in depth and preservation of the tyrannosaurid tracks indicate that these three trackways were made by track-makers walking concurrently in the same direction.' These dinosaurs were apparently walking in the silty sediments from an overflowing river and formed the track marks about 70 million years ago. A thick layer of volcanic ash then preserved the marks, McCrea said. In total, the team found seven tracks that were made by three tyrannosaurs. Though the researchers couldn't identify the specific species, it's likely given the period and location where they were found that Albertosaurus, Gorgosaurus or Daspletosaurus left the tracks, McCrea said.","T-Rex stuck together to 'increase their chances of bringing down prey and individually surviving'

"An ancient landscape long ago submerged beneath the North Atlantic Ocean has been discovered by scientists. Researchers found the 56million-year-old lost terrain, which they have likened to the mythical lost city of Atlantis, by analysing data collected for oil companies using an advanced echo-sounding technique. The 1.2mile-deep landscape is located in the North Atlantic west of the Orkney-Shetland Islands and has peaks that once belonged to mountains and eight major rivers. Scientists were able to construct this 3D image of the landscape submerged beneath the North Atlantic Ocean by measuring the echoes made by underwater sound waves as they hit different land types . It would once have risen up to 0.6miles above sea level and probably joined up with what is now Scotland, and may even have stretched as far as Norway, the scientists said. Researcher Nicky White, from University of Cambridge, said: 'It looks for all the world like a map of a bit of a country onshore. 'It is like an ancient fossil landscape preserved 1.2miles beneath the seabed.' The discovery came from data gathered by a seismic contracting company. A hi-tech echo-sounding technique was deployed that involved releasing high-pressured air underwater - this produced sound waves that travelled through sediment on the ocean floor. An echo would bounce back each time these waves happened upon a change in the terrain through which they were travelling. How the North Atlantic would have looked around 56million years ago. Points a, b and c are where scientists think plume centres were located. The dotted line represents the continental break-up . This echo was then picked up by a microphone being dangled deep underwater from a ship travelling on the ocean's surface. Scientists were then able to . construct a 3D image of the terrain below, at which point they realised . they had evidence of a submerged landscape. Evidence . of land-dwelling life was gathered by core samples taken from the rock . beneath the ocean - these revealed pollen and coal. Elsewhere, the Cambridge scientists found tiny fossils, proving the landscape was once a marine environment. They . believe that the landscape rose up and subsided within 2.5million years . due to the Icelandic Plume - an upwelling of material through Earth's . mantle beneath the North Atlantic Ocean. This functions by carrying hot magma from deep within Earth to just below the surface, where it ripples outwards. Dr White said the landscape was probably swept beneath the Atlantic during this magma surge. Indeed, he claims to have found two more recent underwater landscapes since, both caused by the same phenomenon. The research is published in the journal Nature Geoscience.","Lost terrain is 56million years old .

Waverley Abbey, one of the area's most famous landmarks, is the earliest Cistercian monastery in Britain. The borough is also known for its Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Blackheath Common. The average property price is £325,034, which roughly double the national average. Its main town, Goldaming, was the first in the country to have electric street lights in 1881. The average property price in Waverley is £325,034 compared to a national average of around £162,000.

"Claims: The German lawyer (pictured) has accused his girlfriend of trying to smother him to death with her breasts . A buxom woman has been accused of trying to kill her lawyer boyfriend… with her 38DD breasts. Franziska, 33 from Germany, who weighs nine stone is accused of ‘attempted manslaughter with a weapon’ after her 13-stone boyfriend claimed she tried to smother him with her breasts and pretend it was a sex game. She denies the claim saying it was a sex game and he knew what it was all about. Tim Schmidt told the German court . that although they had had a difficult relationship, until then . everything in the bedroom had been normal. ‘The . incident happened in May – we were having sex,’ he said. ‘She was . sitting on me naked and I was kissing her breasts. Suddenly she grabbed . my head and pushed between her breasts with all of her force. 'I couldn't breathe any more, I must have turned blue. I couldn't tear myself free and I thought I was going to die.' He . said that with his last reserves of strength he had managed to . extricate himself from the woman's vice-like grip and fled naked to a . neighbour and demanded he called the police. Mr Schmidt said when they met four years ago, the couple had been completely in love. He said: ‘Everything was great . between us – and I would have done everything for her. But it started to . go wrong when I got my first job as a lawyer and we moved to Unna. ‘She could not hold down a job and just had one part-time job after the other. And the better my career went – the worst it seemed to be for her.’ He said Franziska tried to kill him after learning he was planning to leave her. ‘It is clear she wanted to kill me,’ he said. ‘She even admitted it to me on the telephone. I asked her why she wanted to smother me to death with her breasts and she told me: ""Treasure – I wanted your death to be as pleasurable as possible.""’","German woman is accused of 'attempted manslaughter with a weapon' after her boyfriend claimed she tried to smother him with her breasts .

"An angry businessman has threatened to raise a weather balloon above his land every day to stop a ‘gang of Hooray Henrys’ from Prince William’s RAF base thundering overhead in their planes. John Arthur Jones, 62, said the aircraft roar over his estate up to 75 times a day, as low as 200ft and at speeds of around 400mph, instead of flying over empty fields. He was so annoyed by the Hawk jets that he threatened to raise a balloon into their flight path every day from his property in Anglesey, North Wales, to deter the pilots. Frustration: John Arthur Jones has planes from RAF Valley in Anglesey regularly flying over his property . Runway: Aircraft at RAF valley, which fly excessively over Boddfordd according to Mr Jones . The chartered surveyor said the planes . from nearby RAF Valley, where the Duke of Cambridge works as a rescue . pilot, were scaring children attending a nursery on his land at Parc . Cefni, where he rents out property to businesses. Long running dispute: Mr Jones says he has corresponded with successive station commanders requesting they adjust their course . He repeatedly wrote to the base, . asking in one letter:  ‘Are our  children being subjected, as some say . in the village, to punishment by a gang of Hooray Henrys for daring to . ask if they will fly  over open fields instead of a children’s nursery?’ In another letter, he warned: ‘Since . you have refused to send independent observers to Parc Cefni I will be . arranging for  a weather balloon to be raised daily at the corner of our . property. It will be taken down each evening at midnight.’ Within 48 hours of the base receiving . the balloon threat, police were dispatched to talk to him and said the . RAF had become concerned for their safety and that of the public. Mr Jones said he felt the response was ‘ridiculous’. ‘I told the policeman I was proposing to put one up because the planes were scaring the children,’ he said. ‘The safety aspect of this was my main concern and I was worried. ‘These planes are coming in at a speed . of around 400mph and as they get to the edge of the property they open . the throttle and give it a hell of a blast. ‘I had noticed that the jets were starting to fly much lower and far more regularly. ‘They were flying straight over us . despite having the rest of the fields surrounding us, which are either . empty or have cattle in.’ The problems are being caused by fighter-jet pilots from Prince William's airbase . A spokesman for RAF Valley said: ‘We . take our broader community responsibilities very seriously and we always . strive to be a good neighbour, so we regret that Mr Jones has had cause . to complain. '[Pilots] are instructed to try to avoid direct over-flight of the Parc Cefni children’s nursery whenever possible.’ Speaking of the response to the . balloon threat, a police spokesman said: ‘North Wales Police classified . the event as “precautionary” and deployed an officer to speak with the . resident and clarify his intentions and advise of the possible dangers . to air traffic and the local community. ‘An amicable conversation ensued during which time our concerns for safety to local residents and air traffic were expressed.’ 'Good neighbours': An RAF spokesman said they take their community responsibilities very seriously and regretted Mr Jones's cause for complaint .

"One of the most iconic settings in American cinema history is up for sale: 'The Godfather' mansion. And the owners are waiting for someone to make them an offer they can't refuse. The home of the Corleone family in the 1972 film is 'to die for' with its 6,248 square feet including seven bedrooms and five bathrooms, according to the Staten Island Advance. The Staten Island estate is on sale through Connie Profaci reality, a real estate agency based in New-Dorp, for $2.89 million, according to the Advance. Scroll down for video . For Sale: The home of the Corleone family in the 1972 film is on sale for $2.89 million . Francis Ford Coppola had an artificial wall built around the home for filming so that it seemed like a compound in the movie . The  exterior of the English Tudor style mansion was used in the movie to shoot such memorable scenes as Connie's wedding. Though the inside of the home was never shown in the film,  the current owner has made many improvements to the home, and some of those were made to look like the interior of the home in 'The Godfather,' like Don Corleone's office, according to the New York Post. The house, built in 1930, was the home of the Norton family for almost 60 years, until they put it up for sale in 2010, according to The Guardian. Before that, it was owned by former Borough President Joesph Palma, who lived there with his wife and 11 children. The current owner reportedly purchased the estate in 2012 for $1.7 million and renovated it to include a gym, a playroom, four garages, two offices, and a pool, The Guardian reports. The home also includes a new dining room and kitchen as well as an exercise room, according to The Guardian. The large backyard (pictured) was used to film the famous opening scenes of the movie, in which Don Corleone's daughter gets married .

'The kitchen is to die for,' estate agent Joseph Profaci told the Advance. 'It has anything you would want for entertaining – big open space, a huge island, and a very large eating area that opens up to the yard and pool. 'My favorite feature of the house is a door on the first floor by the dining room that looks like an old, wood 'speak easy' door that leads down to the basement where there is a pub and a game room, which really is the ultimate man cave. It has a big, beautiful stone fireplace in it.'

"With nine in every 10 cosmetic operations now involving either fillers or Botox, jabs are fast becoming a routine part of the average beauty regime. But there's a snag: unlike surgery, cosmetic fillers remain unregulated and as a result, horror stories about bungled procedures that leave people disfigured and traumatised are increasing. One woman who knows the risks of cosmetic filler all too well is Stacey Hohn, a 41-year-old mother-of-four from London who was left with infected lumps all over her face after being injected with permanent filler. Shocking: Stacey Hohn, 41, was left with lumps all over her face after cosmetic filler became infected . Although initial injections using non-permanent lip plumpers had worked well, Ms Hohn wanted a procedure that lasted and when she was offered the chance to have an irreversible injection for £700, she jumped at the chance. 'They [the surgeon] said ""if you have this done, you don't have . to worry about coming back and having needles"",' she remembers.'I . didn't think anything would go wrong. 'Because it was so expensive, I didn't expect them to inject anything bad into my face.' At first she was pleased with the results but seven years after having the treatment, her lips broke out in lumpy sores that oozed pus. Worse, lumps began appearing all over her face as the filler migrated through fatty tissue, leaving her distraught and too embarrassed to leave the house. Painful: Her lips were covered in pus-filled sores while lumps of filler migrated to other parts of her face . Painful: Ms Hohn had to undergo a two hour operation to remove the lumps of plastic . In a bid to repair the damage, she went to see the surgeon who had performed the original procedure and asked him to help. His solution? Injecting the lumps with an anti-inflammatory - a process that Ms Hohn describes as 'extremely painful'. 'They were as hard . as rocks and I think that angered me more,' she adds. 'He's never apologised - he . never said sorry. 'What's left in my face is hard plastic and hence my . body is rejecting it and pushing it out.' And she's not the only person to have suffered the ill-effects of permanent fillers. Of those who have them, 49 per cent experience problems and of those, 89 per cent need to have surgery to resolve them. The issues created by permanent fillers have not gone unnoticed. Speaking to the Independent newspaper, leading French surgeon, Dr Daniel Marchac said: . 'All of the permanent fillers are creating, from time to time, serious problems with bumps and deformities, and sometimes you have to operate. Dangerous: Leading surgeons recommend avoiding permanent filler because of the risk of problems . Improvement: Although Ms Hohn has been left with faint scars following surgery, the lumps are finally gone . Difference: Ms Hohn says since surgery, she's no longer afraid to smile and leave the house . 'All serious plastic surgeons agree one should avoid permanent fillers. We will see in the future patients of 50 who have had 15 years of fillers with fibrous, tough tissue we wouldn't be able to do anything with.' Another leading cosmetic surgeon, Los Angeles based Dr Francis Palmer, added: 'The issues with permanent fillers . are all the same in my opinion. 'The filler needs to be injected into the . fatty tissues of the face but fatty layers of the face don't stay put. If . they did, we would literally be out of business.' For Ms Hohn, and others like her, the only solution is more surgery to remove the hard lumps of plastic dotted around the face. Cranio-facial specialist, Dr Niall Kirkpatrick, who appears, along with Ms Hohn, in tonight's episode of Channel 5 documentary, Botched Up Bodies, adds: 'You can easily end up with a permanent . problem, which with something that was meant to treat something that was . a small problem in the first place, is a real shame.' After years of suffering thanks to her disfigured face, Ms Hohn, at least, has had the happy ending she hoped for. Five weeks after surgery to remove the plastic-filled lumps, her complexion is visibly smoother and the weeping sores are gone. 'It's made a huge difference,' she says excitedly. 'I keep being told I have a really nice smile, which is great! 'I can finally look people in . the eye and talk to them. I'm no longer hanging my head in shame and . hiding away.'

"Smoking during pregnancy can affect the growth of a woman’s future grandchildren, a new study has warned. Researchers have found that if a maternal grandmother smoked during pregnancy, her grandsons became heavier than expected during adolescence, . But the study also found those grandsons had better cardiovascular fitness. However when both the maternal grandmother and the mother had smoked, girls had reduced height and weight compared with girls whose mothers, but not grandmothers, smoked. Scroll down for video . Smoking during pregnancy can affect the growth of a woman’s future grandchildren, according to a new study (file picture) In non-smoking mothers whose paternal grandmothers smoked during pregnancy, granddaughters tended to be taller, the report claims. And both granddaughters and grandsons tended to have greater bone mass and lean muscle mass. The study was carried out in Britain and published in the American Journal of Human Biology and suggests the effects of smoking during pregnancy can span generations. Senior . author Professor Marcus Pembrey said: ‘These likely transgenerational . effects from the grandmothers' smoking in pregnancy need to be taken . into account in future studies of the effects of maternal smoking on . child growth and development. ‘If replicated, such studies could be a useful model for the molecular analysis of human transgenerational responses.’ NHS . guidelines warn that smoking during pregnancy can increase the risk of a baby being . stillborn, make it more likely that it will be born early and make it . less able to cope with any birth complications.

"A family of four in suburban Spring, Texas was arrested last Friday after neighbors used a free police app to report suspicious activity at the home. Raymond (57) and Stephanie Wood (47) and their son Jess (18) and daughter Madison (22) were all charged with drug possession. Jess's girlfriend Nicole Rips (19) was also arrested. The parents are also facing charges for possessing an illegal weapon. Neighbor Carlie Padgett told KHOU that she witnessed a strange flow of traffic outside the Wood family's home on Candlepine Drive. All in the family: The Wood family of Spring, Texas was arrested last Friday after neighbors reported suspicious behavior at their house using a free police app. Above, mother and father Stephanie (47, left) and Raymond (57, right) Wood . Charges: The family of four was charged with drug possession. Above, daughter Madison (22, left) and son Jess (18, right). Their parents were also charged with possessing an illegal weapon . Search: After receiving two tips on the Wood family from the iWatch app, police searched the home Friday and found illegal drugs and guns on the premises . Wrong place, wrong time? Jess's girlfriend Nicole Rips (19, left) was also arrested, but says she was guilty by association. The couple pictured together on the right . 'There would be a skateboarder that would come down our street,' Ms Padgett said. 'He had a bag in his hand and he would throw it in their yard and pick up a bag and skateboard back out.' She was there on Friday as police searched the home and says she was 'loving it'. Harris County police received at least two tips on the family from their iWatchHarrisCounty app which allows residents to report possible crimes. Sergeant Larry Franks said the narcotics unit then developed probably cause to get a search warrant to enter the house where they found 'a quantity of marijuana, cocaine, morphine and Xanax along with several firearms' including a sawed off shotgun and a SKS-762. Vacation: Madison, Stephanie, Raymond and Jess Wood are pictured together at a theme park in this picture posted on Facebook in November 2010 . But the Wood family denies they did anything wrong, and their lawyer says the search was illegal. Attorney Sam Adamo said the police didn't have a warrant when they initially searched the house. The family also has an explanation for the activity at the house and the weapons. Mr Adamo says Stephanie Wood has leukemia and is forced to work at home where she runs her own e-cigarette business. Both Stephanie and daughter Madison claim to own a company called 'Bayou A Vape' on Facebook, which sell e-cigarettes in addition to vaporizers which can be used for marijuana consumption. Family business: Mother and daughter both claim to own a business called 'Bayou A Vape' on Facebook which sells e-cigarettes as well as vaporizers which can be used for marijuana consumption.

"'Plastic-looking' computer-generated characters in films and video games could soon be a thing of the past, thanks to a new high-definition animation technique. The results will be so lifelike that audiences will be able to see individual skin cells and hair follicles on animated characters played by real-life actors. Researchers, whose previous methods were used in the 2009 film Avatar, now say that they can scan patches on skin on a human face in such high resolution that every blemish, line or change in colour for different facial expressions can be captured on screen. New high-definition scanning techniques could make the faces of computer-generated characters look more realistic. Previous methods developed by the same team were used in the 2009 film Avatar, starring Zoe Saldana . Teams from the University of Southern California and Imperial College London have developed a way of scanning centimetre-square patches of skin all over the face at a resolution of 10 micrometres. It means that just one skin cell covers three pixels on screen, reports the Times. The patches are then mapped on to the 3D model of the actor, which has been created by the actor wearing motion sensors as they perform. The scanning, which takes place in a laboratory, can also pick up the light that penetrates the surface of the skin and how it reacts to different types of light. Professor Paul Debevec, of the graphics research team at USC, told the newspaper: 'The bumpiness of the surface of the skin, at the micron scale, actually affects how light reflects off the surface. 'That's what makes it look healthy or oily or pasty or chalky. It makes someone look like a human being made out of organic material and not like a computer-generated zombie.' The new technique will make it cheaper and easier to add things such as spots, wrinkles and moles to the CGI faces, the Times reports. It cost £150million to carry out the time-consuming work on Avatar, directed by James Cameron, which was 60 per cent computer-generated. The cast, which included Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver and Sam Worthington, performed their roles with motion sensors attached to their bodies and faces and were then transformed by digital animators into the blue-skinned Na'vi. Characters created by computers, such as the Na'vi in Avatar, will no longer be so 'plastic-looking' Video games developers at Activision have already come up with an algorithm that mimics the new scanner to speed up and reduce the cost of the process. Dr Abhijeet Ghosh, of the computing department at Imperial, has since worked with cosmetics firm Avon to see if the scanning facial technique could be used to analyse how skin reacts to make-up. He told the Times that the detail involved in the technology could be used by medics and dermatologists, as well as shoppers wanting to find out how different shades of foundation will suit their skin.","High resolution scan means a skin cell would take up three pixels on screen .

"Despite knowing he was dying, Steve Jobs worked for more than a year on the products that he believed would safeguard the company's future. It was also revealed today that Jobs fought hard to get plans approved for a spaceship-style company headquarters in California. It will be big enough to hold 12,000 employees in a park-like setting near the existing base in Cupertino. He appeared at a town council meeting in June to plead for the planning go ahead. Visionary: Steve Jobs introducing the iPad2 in San Francisco on March 2 this year . Jobs had a part-time job working for Hewlett Packard at the site when he was 13 and he ensured Apple bought the land when it became available. He has also been overseeing the development of the delayed iCloud project, which will allow Apple users to store their music, photos and other documents remotely and masterminding updated versions of the iPod, iPad, iPhone and MacBooks, ensuring at least four years’ worth of products are in the pipeline, according to Apple sources. Pre-order sales of the first authorised biography of Steve Jobs increased by a staggering 44,000 per cent. In memory: A tribute Apple logo created by Hong Kong student Jonathan Mak . Much-loved: Fans leave condolence notes at the Apple store  in San Francisco . iSad: An admirer writes a message on a board in mourning of the death of Jobs outside an Apple store in Manila . According to the official description, the book, out on October 24, is ‘based on more than 40 interviews with Jobs conducted over two years - as well as interviews with more than a hundred family members, friends, adversaries, competitors, and colleagues’. Brand consultancy firm Interbrand predicted that Jobs death could actually boos the value of Apple by around $670million (£431million) from $33.5billion as fans make sympathy and impulse purchases. Jobs died on Wednesday, aged 56, following a lengthy battle with pancreatic cancer. Thoughtful: A man places an iPad displaying a picture of Jobs around candles forming the logo of Apple in southwestern China's Sichuan province . Paying respects: Brandy Faulkner, a neighbour of Jobs, leaves flowers outside his home in Palo Alto, California . Within minutes of his passing being confirmed, tributes had been paid by world leaders, the most famous technology bosses and fans throughout the world. A day later, thousands continued to gather at shrines dedicated to Jobs from California to London, Sydney and Tokyo, Japan. Well-wishers flocked to his home in California to leave flowers and cards, as his family mourned inside. Jobs is survived by a wife, a son and two daughters. Devastated Apple staff, meanwhile, celebrated the life of their former boss with memorial services in his honour. At Apple stores across the world and the company's headquarters, makeshift shrines quickly sprang up as Apple's legions of fans gathered together to remember the life of a man they revered as a hero. Support: Steve Jobs leans his forehead against his wife Laurene after delivering the keynote address to the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in June . 'We are planning a celebration of Steve’s extraordinary life for Apple employees that will take place soon,' Apple chief executive Tim Cook said yesterday. Global leaders from politics and business spoke out about how they had been inspired by the celebrated innovator. Tributes, led by President Barack Obama, began pouring in within minutes of the company confirming Jobs's death. 'We are deeply saddened to announce that Steve Jobs passed away today,' read a statement by Apple's board of directors on Wednesday. 'Steve's brilliance, passion and energy were the source of countless innovations that enrich and improve all of our lives. The world is immeasurably better because of Steve. 'His greatest love was for his wife, Laurene, and his family. Our hearts go out to them and to all who were touched by his extraordinary gifts.' The homepage of Apple's website switched to a full-page image of Jobs with the text, 'Steve Jobs 1955-2011.' Clicking on the image revealed the additional text: 'Apple has lost a visionary and creative genius, and the world has lost an amazing human being. 'Those of us who have been fortunate enough to know and work with Steve have lost a dear friend and an inspiring mentor. 'Steve leaves behind a company that only he could have built, and his spirit will forever be the foundation of Apple.' His relatives also released a statement, which said he 'died peacefully, surrounded by his family. Returning to work: Apple employees arrive passing flags flying at half staff at the headquarters in Cupertino . An Arkansas couple who went to an Apple store to lay down flowers for Steve Jobs spotted the tail end of a burglary instead of a makeshift memorial. Robert Blake and his girlfriend, Amy Parker, told The Associated Press that when they showed up at the suburban Little Rock store on Wednesday night, they didn't initially realise what they were witnessing. Blake said he thought a man running away from the store was just a fellow mourner. Then, he watched the man hop in a getaway car with another man and speed off. Parker said she thought she could see other flowers left in honor of the man who founded and ran Apple. But she soon realised she was looking at broken glass. So, Parker pulled out her iPhone and dialed 911. Police say the two suspects made off with more than two dozen iPhones, plus iPads and laptops on Wednesday. Authorities had not made any arrests by Thursday evening. Snapshots taken from surveillance tapes show a maroon car driving off from the store. Parker and Blake said they own everything the suspects stole - plus iPods and an Apple TV. 'We both not only use the products every day,' she said, 'but both of our jobs are influenced every day by what he's done, too.' Parker edits video for an education company and Blake is a web developer. After the couple talked with police, they left a bouquet of white lilies at the store. 'In his public life, Steve was known as a visionary; in his private life, he cherished his family. We are thankful to the many people who have shared their wishes and prayers during the last year of Steve's illness.' Apple CEO Tim Cook announced the news of Jobs's death to Apple employees via e-mail, in which he said: 'I have some very sad news to share with all of you. Steve passed away earlier today. 'No words can adequately express our sadness at Steve’s death or our gratitude for the opportunity to work with him. We will honour his memory by dedicating ourselves to continuing the work he loved so much.' Within minutes of his death being confirmed, tributes to Jobs began flooding the web, led by President Barack Obama, who tweeted: 'Rest in peace, Steve Jobs. From all of us at #Obama2012, thank you for the work you make possible every day - including ours.' Mr Obama later gave a fuller statement, in which he praised Jobs as a 'visionary' who was 'bold enough to believe he could change the world, and talented enough to do it'. 'The world has lost a visionary,' he said. 'And there may be no greater tribute to Steve’s success than the fact that much of the world learned of his passing on a device he invented. 'Michelle and I send our thoughts and prayers to Steve’s wife Laurene, his family, and all those who loved him.' He added: 'Steve was fond of saying that he lived every day like it was his last. Because he did, he transformed our lives, redefined entire industries, and achieved one of the rarest feats in human history: he changed the way each of us sees the world.' Steve Jobs' high school friend who founded Apple with him in his parents' garage wiped away tears as he paid tribute to the visionary genius. Steve Wozniak, who helped start Apple in 1976, said he will miss his fellow co-founder 'as much as everyone.' 'We've lost something we won't get back,' Mr Wozniak said. 'The way I see it, though, the way people love products he put so much into creating means he brought a lot of life to the world.' Social media sites were inundated with tributes from fans, with one of the most popular messages being that three apples changed the world: ‘The One that Eve ate, the one that dropped on Newton’s head and the one that Steve built.’","Blueprints for new iPod, iPad, iPhone and MacBooks in place .

"Mad: Kim Jong Un points a gun - and has threatened to point his missiles at the US . The nail-biting diplomatic tension over North Korea’s nuclear threats increased last night after despot Kim Jong-un targeted long-range missiles at Guam, America’s military foothold in the region. The rogue state’s president ordered two Musudan rockets and launchers – each capable of delivering one-ton warheads – to be set up in the east of his country, within possible striking range of Guam. Experts are divided on the range and accuracy of the untested Musudan rocket – and whether North Korea has the ability to fit it with a nuclear warhead – but the aggressive moves have spooked the US into further bolstering the defences of the Pacific island. The US stronghold in the tropics – its westernmost territory set in deep ocean between the Philippines and Hawaii – is among a list of targets announced by the North Korean leader that also includes South Korea, Japan and even the US West Coast. But Guam islanders defiantly laughed off the idea of a North Korean attack from 2,100 miles away – and insisted it is nothing but a phoney war. ‘My message to North Korea is, “You just try it. We will annihilate you”,’ said bar manager Lisamarie Flores as she mixed drinks beneath portraits of Princess Diana and William and Kate in the Tower of London pub, a favourite haunt for US servicemen. ‘Kim is just a little dictator trying to show that he’s a big man but there’s no way in the world that we’re going to be frightened of him. ‘People in mainland US might get worked up about this but regulars here don’t even talk about it that much. They’re more interested in the finals of the American national basketball tournament than North Korea.’ Lisamarie added: ‘If there was a conflict and it went nuclear, it would be ugly, of course. But it would be North Korea that would be destroyed.’ At 3pm yesterday, on the frontline of a conflict some experts believe might yet explode into the Third World War, young couples strolled and children played in the white sand and surf of a palm-fringed tropical beach. Relax: Despite North Korean nuclear threats, holidaymakers in Guam, US, sit in the sun on Tumon Beach yesterday . Response: A US Air Force F-22 Raptor stealth jet fighter like the ones based in Guan at the Andersen Air Force Base . Away from the heat of the seafront, holidaymakers ambled lazily through five-star hotel lobbies and an air- conditioned shopping arcade full of designer shops including Louis Vuitton, Burberry, and Gucci. A few streets further back, the Tower of London was doing a roaring trade in B52 cocktails as regulars cracked jokes and chortled at the idea that their afternoon session might be interrupted by a missile strike. With its beaches and hotels packed yesterday, people in Guam – population 180,000 and catchphrase ‘Where America’s day begins’ – seemed determined to shrug off the North Korean menace and carry on with life as usual. The only unusual sight was on the seafront – thronging with Asian and American tourists – where a row of first aid tents had been erected. It transpired they had not been put up to treat casualties of incoming missiles, but athletes injured in the inaugural Guam Marathon taking place today. Military base: A US C-130 aircraft based in Guam where a defence system will be installed to shoot down incoming missiles and warheads amid threats from North Korea . In a sign of how the growing crisis has failed to disrupt island life, 2,000 athletes, including many US servicemen, will race to a finishing line a few miles from Andersen Air Base where B52 and Stealth bombers – along with the rest of a huge US arsenal – are based. ‘This North Korea business is total nonsense,’ the manager of one five-star hotel in Guam’s premier resort of Tumon Beach told me. ‘Our hotel is nearly full and not one person has cancelled since this crisis began. ‘They couldn’t possibly hit us from there and anything they tried to launch would be taken out of the sky at the push of a button.’ Despite the bravado, there is an underlying concern over the threats from North Korea. Guam governor Eddie Calvo said on Friday that all Kim Jong-un needed was ‘one lucky shot’ to cause ‘a lot of damage to our island home’. America has ordered an air defence system called THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defence) for Guam – but it will not arrive for weeks and some islanders fear it may come too late if Kim Jong-un orders a strike. Threats: Kim Jong Un, pictured here on a North Korean army ship, has repeatedly threatened to attack the US . ‘Every day there seems to be a new threat from North Korea and something new for us to worry about,’ said a curator at a museum on the island dedicated to the Pacific wars. ‘It really is scary, whatever people might tell you. ‘We were supposed to have 8,000 US Marines sent to Guam from Japan two years ago but they haven’t arrived because of budget cuts.’ However, in the winding roads leading to the heavily-guarded Andersen base, the mood among indigenous islanders who work there and whose families are supported by the army was more positive and defiant. Speaking outside his home near the base, engineer Steve Aldis said: ‘I’m not worried about an attack. I know the US defences would knock out anything North Korea put up into the sky without even having to send a plane up. Everyone is very relaxed. There is no sense of crisis. We think it’s all just talk.’ Foreigners at risk: North Korean official checks the passports of a group of foreign diplomats and tourists as they board a flight. All foreigners in the country have been warned to get out . Back in bustling Tumon Beach, long-term expatriate Ralf Meyer shared the engineer’s confidence. ‘People living in Guam aren’t nearly as wound up about this as people abroad. I had a call from my brother in Europe last night. He said the TV was saying we were on standby for an invasion. I told him we’d get our pool cues and golf clubs and fight them on the beaches when they landed.’ Mr Meyer, who comes from Switzerland where Kim Jong-un went to high school, said he was baffled that the dictator appeared to have turned out to be such an unhinged figure. Threat: A large number U.S. military bases in the Pacific are within range of the new missiles - shown here . Nascent technology: A map from the Federation of American Scientists and the Center for Non-proliferation Studies shows that North Korea's missiles cannot even reach India about 3,100 miles away . ‘Switzerland is a reasonably democratic country and our schools are good. How can he now behave in such a crazy and illogical way? ‘But I guess the truth is it isn’t him – it’s the generals who are controlling this. ‘We aren’t worried though. Why should we be? We know the firepower we have on the US bases here in Guam. I truly believe we are living in the safest place on earth.’ ANALYSIS by JOHN SWENSON-WRIGHT, CHATHAM HOUSE . North Korea’s threats are aimed  at fostering a sense of crisis with the outside world – and creating a siege-mentality to unify its population squarely behind its inexperienced  30-year-old leader, Kim Jong-un. Since he took over from his father, Kim Jong-il, in December 2011, there has been a campaign to present him as a near-omniscient national saviour and military genius with statues, slogans and photographs of him with his frontline troops. Provoking and sustaining a crisis is also a chance for the North to justify its decision to reopen its plutonium and uranium-based facilities at Yongbyon – which it hopes may be used to help expand its nuclear arsenal of weapons of mass destruction. Missile threat: A North Korean military vehicle carries a missile through Pyongyang. The pariah state have repeatedly threatened to attack the US and South Korea . But Pyongyang also has a broader international objective. It wants to express its irritation and opposition to new, tougher sanctions introduced after its nuclear test in February. It is objecting, too, to the joint US-South Korean military exercises taking place on and around the peninsula since March and which will continue until April 20. Above all, it wants to have direct talks with the US to enhance its status as a legitimate, independent sovereign state, while prising open the door to further concessions from the West. However, US President Obama wants North Korea to abandon its nuclear programme before he is willing to embark on such talks. Yet as the crisis intensifies it is unclear how long the Americans can maintain this conditional approach. The North has been trying to drive a wedge between Washington and Seoul and last week North Korean diplomats in New York reportedly indicated they were prepared to begin dialogue with the new conservative administration of Park Geun-hye in Seoul. Such discussions would be an opportunity, according to the North Koreans, to reactivate a long-term commitment to promoting unification. Seoul’s susceptibility to such talks is potentially a point of difference between Presidents Obama and Park. Danger: The North Korean leader has repeatedly ramped up the rhetoric in recent weeks threatening a military strike . For now, the principal source of concern is the danger of a war occurring through miscalculation or misperception. As the US moves more of its high-profile strategic assets into the region, there is a risk the North will see these as Washington planning to attack the North pre-emptively in the future. There is also a danger that Kim Jong-un will order ever more high- profile provocations that could, in turn, be misread by South Korea and the US as the first step in a more aggressive approach. Pyongyang has a track record of provoking the international community to try to extort political and economic concessions. In two attacks against South Korea in 2010, it shelled an island and appeared to deliberately sink a naval vessel, killing 46 sailors. So often in the Cold War it  was luck rather than rational calculation that prevented conflicts escalating beyond control: national leaders are often poorly equipped to cope with the unexpected when it comes to nuclear weapons. It is worth Obama keeping this in mind in dealing with North Korea. Maintaining deterrence is critically important. But it may be prudent  to combine this with a more imaginative attitude in negotiations to lower the risks in this most volatile of regions.","US are sending a missile defence system to Guam but it will be WEEKS before it arrives .

"A fugitive emu went on the run through a quiet village after escaping from a farm - because it was being bullied. The flightless bird was first spotted running through Combe Florey, near Taunton, Somerset, by members of a local sewing circle and stunned residents watched as it waddled through the village's streets. It was eventually ushered into a garden where it was kept until its owner, a local farmer, arrived. Caged: The escaped emu was kept in a garden until the owner was able to collect it . Officers contacted the owner who arrived the following day from his farm several miles away and took the emu home. He explained to bemused locals the bird had done a runner because has being picked on by a griup of emus on the farm, known as a mob. Jill Marshall, 51, who lives in the village, said: 'The emu came from the next village over - a distance of several miles. 'We can't figure out how he got here, whether he walked, ran or got the number nine bus. 'When the farmer came to collect him, he said that the other emus had been bullying him and that's why he ran away. 'The farmer was going to put him in another pen when they got back to the farm, so I hope he's happy now.' On the run: The bird was eventually delivered back to its owner safe and well .

Neilson Smith said he could not . believe his eyes when he saw the giant creature - more likely to be . found in its native Australia than in rural England - roaming around his . street before it hopped over his fence. Mr Smith said: 'It was getting stressed and I wouldn't have been surprised if it jumped back over the fence and escaped. 'My neighbour called me up and said ""look out your front window, there's something strange."" 'So I asked him if it was an army tank or something, and when I looked out it was an emu. 'It was well and truly on the loose.' Mr Smith's wife Julie managed to coax the bird into their garden on December 7. Mr Smith said: 'Police were guarding it in the garden but I don't think having patrol cars around an emu is what they're paid to do.' Officers tracked down the owner of the escaped bird but Mr Smith was asked to keep it secure overnight until it could be collected. Mr Smith said: 'It was collected in the morning with no ill effects.' The emu was taken away in a horse box by the farmer the following morning. Resident Annie Makepeace said: 'It was all very exciting - we had to stop traffic while we ushered it away.' Feathering the nest: The scared creature is squeezed into the car in north Devon while the authorities tried to contact the owner . It is the second time in as many months that an emu has ruffled feathers in south west England. In November, a four-foot emu was caught running through Barnstaple in north Devon and was eventually ushered into back of a police car until its owner arrived. Police officers said catching the emu, named Betty, was the most 'bizarre' incident in their career. Emus used to fall under the Dangerous Wild Animals Act 1976 but were delisted.

"Many women say they have always wanted to get married but have never found the right man. Now a 31-year-old filmmaker from London has got around the problem but tying the knot to herself. Grace Gelder had been single for six years when she decided to organise the unorthodox ceremony on her own. Grace Gelder says organising a ceremony 'centred on herself' and making personal vows was empowering . She proposed to herself on a park bench, bought a ring and a dress and invited all of her friends to watch her make her vows. Ms Gelder told the Guardian: 'The day was obviously centred on me, the final event being a mirror for me to kiss, but it also felt like I was sharing something very special with my friends, giving everyone an opportunity to reflect on their own ideas of love and commitment. 'I had one friend in her 50s who said it was one of the best weddings she’d ever been to.' Ms Gelder says she was partly inspired by the Bjork song, Isobel, which includes the lyric: 'I'm Isobel, married to myself.' She admitted at the time she decided to hold the event, a relationship with another person 'seemed like too much hard work'. Thinking about the song lyric while sitting on a bench overlooking London in a romantic part of Parliament Hill last November, she decided to pop the question. She said her parents 'took it in their stride' and her grandmother, who has since died, told her she 'always thinks of something new'. The ceremony was completed when Ms Gelder kissed herself in a mirror before celebrating with friends . Despite some friends commenting that the idea was 'a bit narcissistic', others welcomed the plan and another pal who has recently qualified as a celebrant agreed to officiate. After Ms Gelder overcame pre-wedding doubts, 50 people attended the ceremony in a rural farmhouse in Devon, which was donated by a friend for the occasion. They witnessed her complete a number of traditions, including making vows to herself, put a ring on her finger and throw a bouquet over her head. Her sister was the only family member present for the event, due to logistical reasons. Although her wedding is not recognised in the eyes of the law, she hopes her 'incredibly empowering' actions will inspires other single men and women.","Grace Gelder decided to organise a wedding in which she 'married herself'

"Speculation was growing last night that American mercenaries had been deployed to Donetsk after videos emerged of unidentified armed men in the streets of the eastern Ukrainian city. At least two videos published on YouTube earlier this week show burly, heavily armed soldiers with no insignia in the city, which has been gripped by pro-Moscow protests. In one of the videos onlookers can be heard shouting 'Blackwater! Blackwater!' as the armed men, who wear no insignia, jog through the streets. A screengrab from a YouTube video showing armed men on the streets of Donetsk, a largely Russian-speaking city in east Ukraine which has been the scene of large protests against the country's new regime . Donetsk was this week the scene of . civil unrest as pro-Russian elements among its citizens seized control . of the regional administration headquarters and another government . building. Yesterday thousands of people gathered in the city centre waving Russian flags and . calling for a referendum to determine the status of the strategically . important coal-mining region. Both . the videos which purport to show 'Blackwater' mercenaries in Donetsk . were uploaded last Monday, with their descriptions written in Russian. The . context of the videos is not clear, but it appears that the armed men . had turned up at a street protest against the new regime. They wander . around brandishing their weapons before suddenly fleeing the scene as . passers-by shout 'Blackwater! Blackwater!' Both the videos which purport to show 'Blackwater' mercenaries in Donetsk were uploaded last Monday, with their descriptions written in Russian. They could give Russia the pretext to invade the region . The armed men hop down from the elevated position where some had been standing and make their exit . Since the videos emerged, Twitter has been alive with speculation that mercenaries linked to Blackwater, now known as Academi, are active in Ukraine, helping to prop up the embattled new pro-western government. And a Russian diplomat in Kiev told the Interfax news agency on Wednesday that 300 employees of private security companies had arrived there. 'These are soldiers of fortune proficient in combat operations. Most of them had operated under private contracts in Iraq, Afghanistan and other states,' the source said. Interfax reported that the diplomat did not disclose the nationalities of the mercenaries but said, 'Most of them come from the United States'. Asked whether the soldiers seen in the videos could be from Academi, Dr Nafeez Ahmed, a security expert with the Institute for Policy Research & Development, said: ‘Difficult to say really. It's certainly not beyond the realm of possibility - Academi have been deployed in all sorts of theatres. 'I think the question is whether the evidence available warrants at least reasonable speculation. ‘On the face of it, the uniforms of the people in the videos are consistent with US mercs - they don't look like Russian soldiers mercs. On the other hand, why run around in public making a show of it?’ He added: ‘Of course the other possibility is it's all Russian propaganda.’ Any suggestion that a U.S. mercenary outfit like Blackwater, known now as Academi, had begun operating in east Ukraine could give Russian president Vladimir Putin the pretext for a military invasion . As the armed men left the scene, suspicious bystanders could be heard yelling 'Blackwater! Blackwater!' Any suggestion that a U.S. mercenary . outfit like Academi had begun operating in the country could give . Russian president Vladimir Putin the pretext for a military invasion. The . Russian parliament, the Duma, has already voted to give Putin the . authority to take action in the country, where the pro-Russian president . Viktor Yanukovych was last month ousted after mass protests in the . capital, Kiev. Pro-Russian forces have already seized control of the southern Ukrainian province of Crimea, although the Kremlin denies that the thousands of heavily armed, well-equipped men that have appeared there are under its control. Last month a report in the Daily Beast claimed that 'informed sources' in Moscow had said the troops belong to Vnevedomstvenaya Okhrana, a private security contracting bureau similar to Academi that is close to the Kremlin. The videos which emerged this week come amid reports in Russian media which claimed that 300 'strong' men had arrived at Kiev's Boryspil airport carrying military-style bags. Reports speculated that they were being sent to regions in eastern and southern Ukraine where Russian-speaking and ethnic Russian groups posed a secessionary threat to the new government. Blackwater was founded in 1997 by former U.S. Navy SEAL Erik Prince and were one of several private security firms employed by the U.S. government to protect its diplomatic missions overseas. With the outbreak of the Iraq war in 2003 the company's operations expanded and its revenue mushroomed, but a string of controversial killings by its personnel led to a rebranding, first to Xe and then to Academi, its current name. As well as acting as security contractors, Blackwater are seen by some as a private army that can promote U.S. interests without official military involvement. Technically they are a multinational company and can by hired by anyone, but the board of directors includes a number of U.S. establishment figures including John Ashcroft, the former Attorney General, and former NSA chief Bobby Ray Inman. Pro-Russian demonstrators take part in a rally in central Donetsk earlier today: The eastern city is in part of Ukraine where the majority of the population are either Russian-speaking or ethnic Russian . Russia! Help us: Protesters hold signs in English calling for Russian intervention in the region . No to Nato: A woman holds a sign decrying the trans-Atlantic alliance, while the Hammer and Sickle, the flag of the Soviet Union, flies in the background at the pro-Russian demonstration earlier today . Riot police stand guard in front of regional government building which was until Thursday occupied by pro-Russian activists, as demonstrations carry on outside . If Blackwater are present in Ukraine, it would make most sense for them to be deployed in the country's east and south, where pro-Russian protesters raised the Russian flag over the regional parliament last Saturday. It remained in place until Thursday when Ukrainian police regained control of the building without any resistance. Donetsk, home city of deposed president Yanukovich, has seen the most persistent pro-Moscow demonstrations in a wave of protests that have erupted across southern and eastern cities. MailOnline contacted Academi for comment, but there was no reply.","Unidentified armed men seen on the streets of Donetsk in east Ukraine .

"A campaign to plant millions of poppies to mark the centenary of the First World War will go ahead after all – despite being denied Lottery cash. The local scheme proposed by two Kent branches of the Royal British Legion has been rescued by DIY chain B&Q – and now becomes a national project. The Centenary Poppy Campaign will launch next month in a bid to encourage the public, local authorities, schools and businesses to sow millions of seeds across Britain. Organisers said they were ‘over the moon’ at winning backing for the plan, which was endorsed by Prince Charles and David Cameron as a fitting way to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of war in 2014. The award follows the lottery fund's refusal to fund a £92,200 Royal British Legion scheme to help children seed millions of poppies . It was plunged into crisis on Tuesday . when the Heritage Lottery Fund denied the Legion’s Greenhithe and . Swanscombe branches a £92,200 grant because of a ‘high level of demand’ for money. The decision sparked outrage by former military chiefs and MPs and the issue was raised in Parliament. Lord Guthrie, a former chief of the defence staff, said: ‘It is quite a strange decision and a very unfortunate one.’ While . the poppy appeal was rejected, £100,000 was given this week to the . Peace Pledge Union, a pacifist group that wants to raise awareness of . the role of conscientious objectors during the 1914-18 war. Dartford MP Gareth Johnson, left, who had been supporting the project, condemned the decision last night. Prime Minister David Cameron, right, had singled the scheme out for praise . The . RBL’s director of fundraising, Charles Byrne, said: 'The Royal British . Legion is pleased to confirm we are rolling out the Centenary Poppy . Campaign, which originated in the Greenhithe and Swanscombe Branch of . the Legion, UK-wide, and plans for the campaign including a partnership . with a national retailer will be announced imminently. 'The . bid submitted to the Heritage Lottery Fund by the Greenhithe and . Swanscombe Branch of The Royal British Legion was for a local project to . provide poppy seeds in the Kent area only. 'The Legion is now working with the branch and the HLF on a renewed bid to enable the local project to go ahead.' Conservative . MP for Dartford Gareth Johnson, whose great-grandfather died in the . war, condemned the HLF’s position, telling the House of Commons: 'This . project has received support from Prince Charles and numerous charities . and respected organisations. 'It was therefore surprising that the . Heritage Lottery Fund failed to support this project when it came before . them last month. Culture . Minister Hugh Robertson, replying to Mr Johnson, said: 'I would . absolutely agree with you that if there is one thing that is synonymous . with memories of the First World War it is the Flanders Poppy. That’s . one of the reasons why I think this was such a clever idea. Mr Robertson said ministers are not allowed to direct lottery distributors over how to spend money. Centenary: The project is planned to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the First World War . Funds earmarked: David Cameron has already said that £50million will be spent marking the anniversary of the start of the war, pictured, next year . Some . of the bloodiest fighting of the First World War took place in the . Flanders and Picardy regions of Belgium and Northern France. The . poppy is considered an important symbol of the conflict because it was . the only thing which grew in the aftermath of the complete devastation. A Heritage . Lottery Fund spokesman said: 'The Heritage Lottery Fund has been unable . to support a grant application from the Greenhithe and Swanscombe Branch . of the Royal British Legion for a Kent-based project to sow poppies . across the county, not to be confused with the Legion’s proposed UK-wide . Centenary Poppy Campaign. 'Demand . for our funds is high and we are unfortunately unable to support every . application.  We remain deeply committed to helping people to learn . about and tell the stories of the First World War, and have already . invested more than £28million into projects marking the Centenary. 'We . are in discussion with the Royal British Legion at national level and . will be meeting with representatives from the Greenhithe and Swanscombe . Branch of the RBL next week.'","The 2014 Real Poppy project is run by the Greenhithe Royal British Legion .

"A New York news anchor has advised his viewers not to eat infected mucus or feces they find in subway cars if they want to avoid catching Ebola. Errol Louis, the host of Inside City Hall on NY1, offered the advice to his audience in the wake of Dr Craig Spencer being diagnosed as the first Ebola sufferer in New York. Speaking on his show Thursday night, he said: 'People are wondering about methods of transmission... You have to come into intimate contact with it while the person is infected.' Keep it clean: Errol Louis reminded New Yorkers to avoid eating feces during the Ebola scare . 'If you came across some strange mucus or feces or something out there on the subway, the street or anything else - don't eat it! 'Don't let it get into your body, don't touch it,' he continued. No subway snacks: Louis warned against ingesting bodily fluids on the subway now Ebola is in town . The light-hearted recommendation echoed the sentiments of public health officials, who have said repeatedly that Ebola only spreads via bodily fluids, and is not easily contracted. Officials including Mayor Bill de Blasio and New York governor Andrew Cuomo have said New Yorkers should not alter their daily lives in the wake of the first Ebola case, despite concern that Dr Spencer went jogging, ate in restaurants and rode the subway while feeling ill.

"From smart glasses and invisibility cloaks to hover bikes in Star Wars, a lot of futuristic innovations dreamed up in sci-fi novels now exist. And while these gadgets might be cool, a study has revealed that people would most like to see medicine that can cure all illnesses developed in the next 100 years. Humans are also keen to let robots take care of mundane daily tasks, with wrinkle-free clothes and a robot that does the housework among the top five ‘dreams for the future.’ One pill cures all: A new study has revealed that people would most like to see medicine that can cure all illnesses developed in the next 100 years (illustrated with stock image). People are more keen on medical developments than on shiny gadgets . Two thirds of those polled hope for a cure-all pill above all over possible innovations, according to the survey of 1,000 people for Philips. One in five people claim that they would give up their computer, TV or headphones in order to see more health-related innovations. Almost two per cent of people would like to see robots doing the housework or a time machine developed in the next century, while a fifth of those surveyed simply want a cure for baldness. Self-driving cars are also among the inventions that are in demand and these are already being tested. Both Google and BMW are refining their innovations and a pilot scheme is taking place in Milton Keynes in 2017 to test a network of 100 futuristic driverless 'pods'. No need to lift a finger: Humans are also keen to let robots take care of mundane daily tasks, with wrinkle-free clothes and a robot that does the housework (illustrated) among the top five 'dreams for the future' as voted for in the survey . The study also polled people on what they thought were the top inventions of the past century. The internet and world wide web came top with over half of Britons considering it to be the most important innovation in the last 100 years. The string of intentions that make up the internet saw five of its founding fathers win the first Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering last year. Among the top five inventions were two health breakthroughs, with 40 per cent of Britons placing the most importance on keyhole surgery and 33 per cent on the pacemaker, which have transformed millions of lives. Easy rider: The licences only apply to employees of autonomous vehicle manufacturers  and say that a car 'needs to be insured for at least $5,000,000 against personal injury, death, or property damage.' The rules state that test drivers must sit in the driver seat (pictured)and be capable of immediately taking control of the vehicle . ‘Surprisingly, only a quarter of respondents to the poll said that smartphones were the most meaningful innovations of the last century, while innovations that improved their health, well-being and sense of security were the ones to top the list,’ cyber-psychologist, Jacqui Taylor said. ‘The British still love technology that keeps them connected with each other, but there is a greater demand for innovation that has a positive impact on their home and family life. They want innovations to understand and address their deeper human needs.’ Consumer electronics such as mobile phones and television formed the final two inventions of the top five breakthroughs of the past century, while people are raising their expectation in the next 100 years, with just under a third of Britons keen to make use of a time machine. Wander Bruijel, head of brand at Philips UK and Ireland, said: 'Technology that keeps us connected has fundamentally changed the way we live, work and interact with one another. ‘But as some key societal trends and challenges catch up to us – such as an ageing population, a pressure on our environment, and a desire to live more happily and healthily – it’s not surprising that we are looking for innovative solutions that address those more meaningful concerns.’ Medically minded: The study polled people on what they thought were the top inventions of the past century. While the internet and email came first, keyhole surgery and pacemakers (pictured) are among the top five innovations voted for by the British public .","Survey revealed that two thirds of Britons hope for a cure-all pill above all over possible innovations in the next century .

"A woman seemed to experience a brain snap after she couldn't get any cash out of the ATM prompting her to tear apart the machine with her own hands.

A woman single-handedly tears apart the ATM machine in a shopping mall in Dongguan in Guangdong Province . CCTV footage showed she managed to disassemble the machine within a matter of minutes . A crowd gathered, including a security guard, and watched on while police were called . However, despite at least three security guards attending the bizarre scene - no one attempted to stop the woman from damaging the machine. The woman was seen mumbling to herself and hitting the machine at the Shilong Jingshawan Shopping Mall at 5.50pm on October 16, a centre representative told the Southern Metropolis Daily, according to the China Smack website. The representative said that the security guards were called to the scene after reports of the woman pulling apart the machine within a 'short few minutes'. 'We can see from the mall's security cameras that she first pried off the plastic frame/case off the sides of the ATM, and then forcefully tore out the computer display,' the representative said. 'After dismantling the machine, she even stood there as if nothing had happened, but was then taken back to the police station once police arrived.' The woman told police that she had repeatedly tried to make withdraw money from the machine . There ended up being three security guards keeping an eye on the situation as the woman just stood back and looked at her destruction . The woman told the officers that she repeatedly tried to withdraw money from the ATM without success. The representative said the footage showed she did not use any tools to pull apart the machine. One possibility for the woman able to dismantle a machine so easily might be the ATM had been in service for a long time and that 'the plastic casing surrounding it has become old and brittle, and was therefore easy to damage,' the spokesperson said.

The undated footage, which was uploaded to YouTube on Saturday, has already had more than 1.5 million views. It shows Howard on the train with her friends telling Pena, who is wearing a leather 8 ball jacket and fur hat, to stay away before she starts to insult his clothing. Her friends egg her on and clap as she throws insults at the unnamed man, who nods and smiles at her. Howard tells Pena: 'You got a dumb*** 8 ball jacket that came out in the 1990s.' As she is holding a pair of high-heeled snake skin boots she says: ‘I’m done. You wanna know what shoes I’ve got on? They’re Steve Madden ones, alright?’ before sitting down. She was insulting his dress sense and told him 'You got a dumb*** 8 ball jacket that came out in the 1990s' The young woman's friends jump up when they see that another passenger is recording the argument .

He backs off but Howard knocks the phone from his hand – sending it flying to the ground but it is still recording and he tells her ‘you’re petty as hell – you can’t even afford this.’ The man picks it up but she knocks it from his hands again before continuing her attack on Pena. 'You sound stupid,' she shouts at him from behind before hitting him on the back of his head with her boot.

"This ancient oasis in the middle of a Chinese desert was in danger of disappearing beneath the sands until the government stepped in to save it. Located about 6km south of the city of Dunhuang in north west China, the Crescent Lake (Yueyaquan in Chinese) is a fresh water spring in the shape of a half moon. The oasis, which is believed to have existed for 2,000 years, was shrinking fast due to increasing desertification in the region before the government began to refill it. Oasis: Yueyaquan Crescent Lake in Dunhuang, north west China is completely surrounded by sand dunes. The arid region barely gets any rain each year . Remote: The tiny lake was disappearing fast - with a dramatic decline in water depth during the past three decades - before the government stepped in to save it . Restored: The water level is believed to have risen annually since it began to be refilled in 2006. The site, which is believed to be about 2,000 years old, is popular with tourists . The lake has gone from having an average depth of about 5m in 1960, to an average of less than a meter in the early 1990s as the underground water table has declined dramatically. In 2006, the local government decided to step in and rescue the oasis, refilling it with water. It has increased in depth since then, Niceartlife.com reports. The lake is 218m long from east to west and 54m wide from north to south and contains pure spring water. Next to the lake is a traditional pagoda and a street lined . with souvenir stalls. The site is popular with . tourists who are taken on camel rides by guides to the peaks of the surrounding dunes. The lake's remarkable survival in the middle of the desert is believed to be due to its low altitude, while its position is also thought to prevent excess sand from the surrounding dunes falling into it. Dunes: Tourists take camel rides into the dunes surrounding the lake which stands out amongst the sand of the desert . Problem: The Chinese Government plans to introduce a range of measures to tackle increasing desertification which threatens various regions . Arid: A guide leading camels near the lake. The region has suffered from increasing desertification in recent decades . Surrounded by high mountains, Dunhuang has an arid climate - and is extremely hot in the summer and cold in winter. Rain only occurs in tiny amounts and quickly evaporates, resulting in the desert landscape. Desertification has become a major environmental problem in China which the government has tried to tackle in various ways. This includes the proposed creation of a 'green wall' of forests to counter the spread of deserts. Business: Guides, dressed in distinctive red jackets, wait for trade. The lake's water level dropped more than 25 feet in three decades before it began to be refilled . Dry: A man, thought to be a guide, smoking a cigarette looks out across the parched deserts surrounding the lake. China has suffered from severe dust storms due to the growth of its desert regions . Weather: A guide waits for tourists next to a group of camels. The area suffers from extremes in temperature, from very high summer temperatures to freezing winters . Hard work: An exhausted camel takes a rest in the sand as another guide peers across the area. The Chinese Government is taking steps to address the country's increasing desertification . Historic: A cart carries a group of tourists at the lake. The city of Dunhuang relies heavily on tourism and features a number of historic sites dating back to the Han Dynasty .","Crescent Lake near Dunhuang is a spring in the shape of a half moon .

"Taking to the water for the first time, the stunning £400million megayacht is one of the largest and most expensive ever to be built. Four years of work have gone into creating the huge boat which is the brainchild of a British designer based, ironically, in landlocked Rutland. But despite the conspicuous size of the yacht, named Topaz, the identity of its owner remains shrouded in secrecy. The stunning megayacht is one of the largest and most expensive ever to be built . At 147-metres, it is the fourth longest yacht ever built and a mere 15-metres shorter than Roman Abramovich's Eclipse, which currently holds the bragging rights. The vessel also boasts a weight thought to be in excess of 12,000 tonnes. Whoever the lucky owner is, they are likely to have very deep pockets. The identity of the billionaire customer . is unknown with Lurssen, the boat's manufacturer, unwilling to discuss personal clients due to . strict confidentiality agreements. The German-built megayacht is thought to be the largest ever - with a gross weight in excess of 12,000 tonnes . Topaz is understood to have been the work of British designer Tim Heywood, who is based in Rutland . The mystery customer is expected to be paying upwards of £300 million for the elegant vessel . As a result, details surrounding the yacht remain sketchy, but a vessel of this size is anticipated to have a price tag of between £300 to £400million. Topaz is understood to have been the work of British designer Tim Heywood. The 62-year-old, who has been in the industry for 40 years, has played a major role in producing some of the world's finest yachts. From his office overlooking Rutland Water, he has designed the likes of the 133-metre 'Mirqab', which was named 2009 yacht of the year, and Roman Abramovich's old boat, the 115-metre Pelorus. Mr Abramovich's latest vessel, the 163.5m Eclipse, is about to be - well - eclipsed by a 180m monster known only as Project Azzam. Ousted: But Mr Abramovich is about to lose his title as the owner of the world's largest private yacht - after this incredible vessel was spotted in Germany last month . On the move: The yacht, which was minus its bow . section, was quickly taken to the larger 220-metre dock so engineers . could continue the awesome project . Huge: Eclipse, owned by Chelsea Football Club owner Mr Abramovich, has two swimming pools, two helipads, a gym, hair salon, dancefloor and a 007-style submarine . It is rumoured the boat, which is longer than some cruise ships, has been commissioned by the Saudi Royal Family. Stunned . photographers captured the vessel earlier this month as it was transported out of the . 170-metre dry dock at Lurssen's yard... because it had . become too large. The . yacht, which was minus its bow section, was quickly moved to the larger . 220-metre dock so engineers could continue the awesome project.","Not the biggest billionaire's plaything but one of the most expensive .

"The remains of an ancient temple buried beneath a residential street has been accidentally unearthed in Egypt. The base of columns, limestone blocks engraved with hieroglyphs, and a statue fragment were among the treasures taken from the 3,400-year-old site. But its discovery was hit by controversy when seven men were arrested for carrying out an illegal excavation in the Giza town. The remains of an ancient temple buried beneath a residential street has been accidentally unearthed in Egypt. The base of columns, limestone blocks engraved with hieroglyphs (pictured), and a statue fragment were among the treasures taken from the 3,400-year-old site . Egyptian police revealed that the seven men reportedly started digging in the back garden of the Al-Badrashin property two weeks ago, but ran into problems when the hole started to fill with water. This led to neighbours calling the police, who raided the property and arrested the amateur archaeologists. The group was held briefly before being released, after the authorities said the site was not an official archaeological area, and it had not previously been known to contain items of archaeological significance. Experts then examined the remains and confirmed the site, situated 25 miles (40km) south of Cairo, was indeed located above an ancient temple. The base of a column found on the site is pictured. Egyptian police said seven men reportedly started digging in the garden of the Al-Badrashin property two weeks ago, but ran into problems when the hole started to fill with water. This led to neighbours calling the police, who raided the property and arrested the group . The temple was dug up in the back garden of a property in Al-Badrashin, Giza. The site is situated 25 miles (40km) south of Cairo (pictured). Antiquities police spokesman Major General Momtaz Fathi said: ‘There is no doubt this is a major discovery and there is also no doubt there is a lot more still to be found’ Antiquities police spokesman Major General Momtaz Fathi said: ‘There is no doubt this is a major discovery and there is also no doubt there is a lot more still to be found.’ Trained archaeologists have now moved in, declaring it an official archaeological zone, and have so far recovered seven large limestone blocks engraved with hieroglyphic inscriptions in ‘excellent quality’. Under King Thutmose III's reign, the Egypt’s empire reached its greatest extent, from northern Syria to the Fourth Cataract of the Nile in Nubia . The reign of King Thuthmose III is considered a golden age in Egyptian history. He succeeded the throne at the age of two, after his father died in 1479 BC. For the first 22 years of his reign, he shared power with his aunt and stepmother Hatsheput and only became pharaoh when she died in 1458. He ruled for a further 32 years after Hatshepsut’s death. Under his reign, the Egypt’s empire reached its greatest extent, from northern Syria to the Fourth Cataract of the Nile in Nubia. One of the first acts of Thutmose III's rule was to launch a campaign against the Mitanni and the prince of Kadesh, who encouraged Egypt's states in Syria to Palestine to revolt. King Thutmose III defeated the enemy and campaigned in Syria every summer for the following eighteen years. He has been dubbed ‘Napoleon of ancient Egypt' because of his military activities. His tomb in the Valley of the Kings was the first fully-decorated burial chamber. They also found the basis of several columns, and a statue fragment said to be around six feet (1.8 metres) high, carved out of pink granite. A spokesman for the Egyptian antiquities police added the statue appeared to be a person seated, and the team were hoping to find more fragments. The presence of these artefacts suggests the temple was built under the reign of Egypt's most successful ruler, King Thuthmose III, who reigned between 1479 and 1425 BC.

"Three police officers have been pulled from street duty for their safety in Southern California after a video of them shooting a dog dead as they arrested its owner hit the internet. A cellphone video that had more than 3.7 . million views on YouTube by Thursday morning shows the dog, named Max, . being shot after scrambling out of a car's back seat through a window . and lunging at officers who had handcuffed its master. The dog's owner Leon Rosby had been filming a police raid in Hawthrone California, and was arrested for alleged obstruction of justice. Scroll down for video... (Warning: Graphic Content) Dog shot by police: A Rottweiler was shot by a police officer in Hawthorne, California when he jumped out of a car and ran towards his owner, who was being arrested . Witnesses can be heard crying out in distress after watching the dog's grisly death. Hawthorne . police spokesman Lt. Scott Swain told the Daily Breeze the decision is . for the officers' safety after the uniformed officer shot the dog four . times on Sunday. Numerous death threats have been directed at the officers. Mr . Rosby, said police needlessly killed his dog. His lawyer, Michael . Gulden, said Rosby's complaint will be added to an existing lawsuit . Rosby has against police. 'I understand that people have been affected by this video. Anyone would be,' Swain told the Breeze. 'The police officers involved are affected by this incident and having to kill a dog. ""I . don't understand how it translates into an eye for an eye: `We are . going to kill you and your family because of this incident,'"" he said of . the threats to the officers. Chief . Robert Fager has called for calm and urged people to be patient as . police investigate the shooting, and also avoid information being . circulated through social media because ""fallacies are being . perpetuated."" Officers in the field have been told to be vigilant against any possible retaliation. ""You'd . like to believe that maybe some of the people are just venting, but . then you've got to be realistic. There are crazy people out there,"" Swain said. The . 130-pound, 3-year-old Rottweiler named Max was shot to death after he . escaped through a window in a parked car and ran over to his master, . Leon Rosby, who was being arrested for filming the scene on his phone. The video (watch original on YouTube) shows Rosby, 52, walking his dog Sunday around 7 p.m. near a house with several police squad cars parked outside. He is seen filming the scene in order 'to make sure nobody's civil rights were being violated,' he told DailyBreeze.com. Rosby is then seen talking to a pair of police officers in the distance. Hawthorne Police Lt Scott Swain said that officers were warning Rosby to turn down the music in his car. 'It's distracting the officers. It's interfering with what they are able to hear,' Lt Swain said earlier this week. 'It's not just a party call. It's an armed robbery call. The officers need to hear what's going on with the people being called out of the residence. That music in his car is bleeding over and it's distracting them.' A neighbor who witnessed the event said they heard Rosby yell 'It's my (expletive) radio!' to officers. But Rosby said that didn't happen because as a Christian he doesn't swear. 'I do apologize if I didn't immediately comply,' Rosby said. 'The music may have been a little loud but I was complying.' Watchdog: Rosby was out walking his dog when he came across a police scene and started taking video to make sure civil liberties weren't being . Noise complaint: A Hawthorne Police spokesman said that officers were telling Rosby to turn down his music, which was distracting for those trying to work on the scene . Leaving: Police are seen approaching Rosby as he puts Max in the car, where the windows are rolled down . Eventually the two officers start . walking towards Rosby, who puts Max into his car where the windows are . rolled down. Rosby seems to calmly walk over to the officers and turn . around, volunteering himself for arrest. As the officers put handcuffs on Rosby, the dog starts barking and manages to jump out of the car. Another police officer comes over and looks like he's trying to grab the leash when the dog jumps up and the officer shoots him several times. Turning himself in: Rosby walks over to the officers, turns around, and allows them to handcuff him . Escape: Max beings to bark as his owner is walked towards the squad cars, and he manages to squeeze out the windows . Attack? Another officer comes over and seems to reach for the dog's leash when Max jumps - that's when the shooting starts . Dead: The officer continues to shoot the dog several times. A police spokesman says they were protecting Rosby too . 'He literally killed my puppy I had since he was 6 weeks old,' Rosby said. In the video, Rosby is noticeably upset. 'I was crying and hollering, ""My dog! Max! Max!""' Rosby doesn't understand why police didn't let him go to properly secure his dog, or why they continued to arrest him after he put the dog in the car - a sign that he was leaving. 'There was no way Max should have died like that,' Rosby said. 'Max was only protecting his master. He was trying to stop them from beating on me.' 'All he did was love me,' he added. Lt Swain, however, alleges that the officers were also looking out for Rosby. 'I know it's the dog's master, and more than likely not going to attack him, (but) we've got a guy handcuffed that's kind of defenseless. We have a duty to defend him too,' Swain said. Rosby was held overnight in jail on suspicion of obstruction of justice and released at 5 AM the next day. Rosby says that police would not return his dog's body to him. His attorney Michael Gulden says that Rosby is planning on filing a lawsuit against the Hawthorne Police Department. Dog shot: Rosby's lawyer says they are planning on filing a suit against the police department for the dog's killing . Apparently this isn't the first time that Rosby has had issues with the local police. His prior record includes convictions for resisting arrest, battery and driving under the influence. Rosby, a black man, has filed six complaints alleging mistreatment and racial profiling by the Hawthorn Police. 'There's been a pattern of harassment against him and other African-Americans in Hawthorne. Last July, the police responded to his home and beat him unnecessarily, then threw him in jail for no reason. We sued for that. We'll amend that complaint to include the dog incident,' Gulden said. As of Monday night, the video had 510 views and almost 400 comments.","Hawthorne police say the officers are in danger after video hit the internet .

"A WWII veteran who has suffered chronic pain since he was caught in an explosion has finally been cured of the suffering after he gave in to his wife’s nagging - and had acupuncture. Bernard Martin, 85, had been forced to take 19 painkillers a day to ease the agony of the injuries which have stayed with him for most of his life. The father-of-one was caught in two lethal blasts in Malaysia and Germany in 1945, suffering spinal damage and contracting malaria and leptospirosis, while serving with British forces. Bernard Martin, who served in the Royal Fusiliers in 1946 (pictured right), suffered from back pains and headaches after being caught in an explosion. He eventually found relief after following his wife Gloria's advice . While his injuries healed he was left with lingering pain in his back and headaches which have frustrated him for the rest of his life. He refused to go to an acupuncturist for two years despite his wife Gloria, 79, constantly claiming it had helped her osteoporosis. But he eventually gave in and has made such an incredible improvement medics have taken him off all his medication. Mr Martin said his pain is now 'virtually non existent' and said he is overjoyed to be able to lift his right leg for the first time in 67 years. The retired home furnishings store manager said: 'After the war I tried to put the experience behind me and get on with the rest of my life. I just felt lucky to be alive. 'But my injuries were bad and I have suffered severe pain over the years. The pain would stop me from sleeping and I would wake up in the middle of the night in agony. 'I used to be on so many painkillers a day, 19, and I would rattle. 'Now I take none, my GP is happy for me to stop the painkillers and the pain is virtually non-existent. 'I was a very sceptical man before I had acupuncture - I would never have opted for an ‘alternative’ treatment. 'My wife kept telling me to try it out for about two years. In the end she booked me an appointment and told me I had to go. 'It’s been amazing. I fell like I’ve finally got my life back. I am 85 but I do not feel it. It is brilliant to be able to spend time doing my hobbies and help my wife out with the chores. 'It is so much better not to be sat in front of the television - that is the quickest way to the junk yard.' Bernard fighting fit in the army just after WW2 (left) was forced to take 19 painkillers a day to ease his pain in later life (right) Bernard, from Stowmarket, Suffolk, served as a platoon sergent with the Royal West Kent Regiment and fought in Malaysia for three years during WW2. The veteran was eventually classed as 60 per cent disabled because of his deteriorating condition and medically discharged after 15 years with the Royal Fusiliers. Bernard lost his second toe on his left foot, caught malaria and leptospirosis, was left with crippling arthritis in his spine, lost his hearing and suffered from terrible headaches - ailments which all contributed to his lifetime of pain. He was fit enough to manage a job as a general manager of a furnishing and carpet firm, but suffered extreme pain often waking in the middle of the night in agony. Eventually Bernard decided to have acupuncture and alphastim, which uses electronic stimulation rather than needles, at the Pain Relief Clinic in Stowmarket, Suffolk. Now he is fit and well and enjoys spending his time working on his hobby of wood carving and the treatment is even believed to stem the recurrence of malaria. Acupuncturist Annya Stoddart, who treats Bernard, said: 'You cannot beat a days work when you are making a positive difference to people’s lives. 'We cannot help everyone, but I have treated many people like Bernard who arrive taking a bucket load of painkillers and leave not needing any.'","Mr Martin eventually went to have acupuncture after he gave in to his wife's nagging .

"A woman who worked at a Philadelphia abortion clinic has testified how she was handed a glass pan carrying a screaming newborn with no eyes or mouth and told to deal with it. Sherry West, who is a witness in the murder trial against her former boss Dr. Kermit Gosnell, said that when the tiny 'specimen' screamed 'it sounded like a little alien'. West is testifying in the case under a deal with prosecutors . after she pleaded guilty to third-degree murder involving the death of a 41-year-old woman at the clinic. Gosnell, 72, is charged with murdering seven babies at Philadelphia Women's Medical Society and with the death of the woman, who suffered cardiac arrest after she was given too much anesthesia. Horror: Sherry West, left, has testified that she witnessed undeveloped fetuses being born at the clinic run by Dr. Kermit Gosnell, right, who is on trial for murdering seven babies and one woman . He performed illegal, late-term abortions and when the babies were born alive, he would sever their spinal cords to kill them, prosecutors have claimed over the four-week trial. West agreed that she was shocked at the size of the women who visited the clinic, as many looked as if they were too far along in their pregnancies to undergo an abortion. She said that she hated working at the clinic but, like other employees there, she was given a job by Gosnell when she was struggling and desperate for money, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. She had left her job as a surgical technician after 22 years when she contracted hepatitis C and began suffering from depression. She had not received a pay check in nearly two years when Gosnell, who had been her own doctor for two decades, offered to find her some work. On trial: Kermit Gosnell, pictured, is accused of killing the babies at the Philadelphia Women’s Medical Society clinic and a 41-year-old woman who was administered too much anesthesia and suffered cardiac arrest . She went on to learn how to perform ultrasounds and give IV sedatives and drugs. In . one particularly graphic description, she spoke about a time when she . was handed a 18- to 24-inch-long newborn in a glass pan by an assistant who asked for her help. 'I saw it, and I thought, ""What do you expect me to do?""' she said. 'It . didn't have eyes or a mouth but it was like screeching, making this . noise. It was weird. It sounded like a little alien.' She said she was so 'freaked out' that she left the room and did not know what happened to the baby. She insisted the employees did not give drugs to patients without first calling Gosnell. Murder? West, a former worker at the Women's Medical Society, said many women came to the clinic for abortions but looked as if they were too far along in their pregnancies to be there . 'House of horrors': Another former employee claimed he saw 100 live babies killed at the clinic, pictured . Unfathomable: A grand jury photograph shows what police say are plastic bags hiding body parts in a refrigerator inside the Philadelphia practice . She said she was present when Karnamaya Mongar went into cardiac . arrest during an abortion in November 2009 and that Gosnell later held a . staff meeting to tell workers what to say to police. West did as she was told, explaining: 'I felt a loyalty to him because he had been my doctor for so long.' Other employees have described how they saw about 100 babies born alive and then 'snipped' with . surgical scissors in the back of the neck, to ensure their 'demise'. Others spoke of gruesome scenes at the clinic which was allegedly found dirty and rundown with rusting surgical instruments. 'Victim': Karnamaya Mongar, 41, died at Gosnell's clinic during an abortion procedure in November 2009 . A Grand Jury report said the clinic was . crawling with cats and reeking of animal urine and feces. Furniture and . blankets were stained with blood and instruments were not properly . sterilized. Disturbingly, the report alleged that fetal remains were stuffed . into: 'cabinets, in the basement, in a freezer, in jars and bags and . plastic jugs'. 'It . would rain fetuses. Fetuses and blood all over the place. It is . literally a beheading. It is separating the brain from the body,' one former employee Stephen Massof told NBC. But he said he believed the . intentions of his boss were honest and that the doctor believed he was helping the . women, often extremely poor, who came to him . The doctor: Kermit Gosnell . Charged: Pearl Gosnell . Employee: Elizabeth Hampton . Arrested: Tina Baldwin . Assistant: Lynda Williams . Worker: Adrine Moton . Accomplice: Eileen O'Neil . Locked up: Stephen Massof . Held: Maddline Joe . 'I believe that Dr. Gosnell was honestly trying to help women and protect them from abuse and neglect,' Massof said. The trial is in its fourth week and is expected to last another month. If Gosnell is found guilty he could be given the death penalty. Eight clinic employees have pleaded guilty to various charges, while a ninth is on trial with Gosnell. Gosnell's lawyer denies the murder charge and disputes that any . babies were born alive. He also challenges the gestational age of the . aborted fetuses, calling them inexact estimates.","Dr Kermit Gosnell, 72, is on trial for 'murdering seven babies and a woman, 41' at an abortion clinic in Philadelphia .

"Safe standing could return to the Premier League after the Liberal Democrats revealed they will include the pledge in their 2015 General Election manifesto. The party advocate the introduction of rail seats, which are popular in the German Bundesliga, rather than a return to terracing. All-seater stadiums have been compulsory in the Premier League and the Championship since the start of the 1994-95 season, at the recommendation of the Taylor Report following the Hillsborough disaster, which claimed the lives of 96 Liverpool fans in 1989. Safety first: Rail seating will be part of the Liberal Democrats' General Election manifesto next year . 'Safe standing is allowed in many other sports and we do not believe that the top level of football should be an exception,' Liberal Democrat spokesperson John Leech MP told the BBC. 'We are not calling for a return of the terraces of the 1980s. Modern safe standing areas using rail seating operate very successfully in top-tier football across Europe.' Rail seats can be locked in an upright position to form a barrier for fans to lean against. They can then be unlocked if seating is required. Several Premier League clubs have declared their support for a return to standing, including Manchester United. Stand and deliver: Borussia Dortmund are among a number of German clubs who utilise rail seating . Sportsmail revealed in February that the Old Trafford club were behind the move. Aston Villa, Hull and Swansea have also been vocal about the issue, as has the Football Supporters' Federation. A spokesman told the BBC: 'Football can't bury its head in the sand. Tens of thousands already stand at games.' But the Premier League remains opposed to the idea. They said: 'It remains the Premier League's position that stadiums should be all-seat, in line with government policy, and we will not be encouraging the government to change the law.'","Liberal Democrats will include safe standing pledge in manifesto .

"60 per cent rise in illicit photography . Apps let users take photos - but only show innocent-looking emails on screen . Silent camera apps already on sale in West . Police say that the number of 'illicit photography' incidents in Japan has shot up 60 per cent - driven by apps designed to let users take stealthy photos . Most smartphone cameras have a built-in shutter noise to prevent the camera being used to take pictures without people's consent. But a new wave of 'silent' apps - some specifically designed for voyeurism - have been blamed for a huge rise in illicit photography in Japan. There were 1,741 incidents last year, according to a report in Mercury News, an increase of 60 per cent on the figure five years ago. The problem is blamed on the rise in 'silent camera' applications - including ones which deliberately conceal what the user is doing by putting an innocent-looking email or text message on screen while he or she photographs. There are dozens of silent camera applications already available on Android Market and iTunes store - and on Android particularly, there are several that appear to market themselves as being for stealthy photography. 'The latest applications include 'upgraded versions' that enable people to silently take photos while an email or website is displayed on the phone’s screen to provide cover for the surreptitious picture-taking,' said the report. Japanese academics have called for regulation of silent photography applications - saying that they are being used for crimes. With Google's 'anything goes' policy on Android, where applications are not vetted before publication on Market, and users can also download apps from elsewhere on the web, it will be very difficult to police. A silent camera app on Android market -  it says 'Silent Snap Camera allows u to take photos without the annoying camera click! This setting is disabled on many phones Silent Snap will override this for u to take silent shots or use spy camera style' Most smartphones also include a way of disabling the noise of camera applications even in the built-in apps.","60 per cent rise in illicit photography .

"The lubricating effect of melting water on glaciers will have only a ‘minor’ role in future sea level rises, according to new research. Scientists had feared that melt water which trickles down through ice could dramatically speed up the movement of glaciers as it acts as a lubricant between the ice and the ground it moves over. But a team from the University of Bristol found it is likely to have a minor role in sea level rises, compared with other effects such as iceberg production and surface melt. The lubricating effect of melting water on glaciers will have only a 'minor' role in future sea level rises, according to new research . Results from computer modelling - based on fieldwork observations in Greenland - revealed that lubrication will add less than five per cent of the total projected contribution from the Greenland ice sheet. Some simulations found the lubricating effect could even have a negative impact on sea level rise - leading to a lowering of sea level when the other major factors were ignored. Sarah Shannon, from the University of Bristol, was lead author of the research, which was published in Proceedings Of The National Academy Of Sciences Of The United States Of America (PNAS). ‘This is an important step forward in our understanding of the factors that control sea level rise from the Greenland ice sheet,’ Dr Shannon said. Scientists had feared that melt water which trickles down through ice could dramatically speed up the movement of glaciers as it acts as a lubricant between the ice and the ground it moves over . ‘Our results show that . melt-water-enhanced lubrication will have a minor contribution to future . sea level rise. Future mass loss will be governed by changes in surface . melt water runoff or iceberg calving.’ Scientists had feared that melt water which trickles down through ice could dramatically speed up the movement of glaciers by acting as a lubricant between the ice and the ground. The researchers found that this is not likely to be the case because a lot of the water runs off through channels meaning it does not act as a lubricant. Therefore, it is likely to have a minor role in sea level rises compared with other effects, such as iceberg production and surface melt. Lubrication will add less than five per cent of the total projected contribution to sea level rises from the Greenland ice sheet. Previous . studies of the effects of melt water on the speed of ice movement . assumed the water created cavities at the bottom of ice masses. These cavities filled with water which lifted the ice slightly and acted as a lubricant, speeding up flow. The theory led scientists to think that increased melt water would lead directly to more lubrication and a consequent speeding up of the ice flow. But the Bristol study took into account observations indicating larger amounts of melt water may form channels beneath the ice that drain water away. This would reduce the water's lubricating effect. The research concluded that the effect on sea level is small, regardless of whether melt water increases or decreases.Dr Shannon added: . ‘We found that the . melt water would lead to a redistribution of the ice, but not . necessarily to an increase in flow.’ The findings are part of research undertaken through the European-funded ice2sea programme. Results from computer modelling revealed that lubrication will add less than five per cent of the total projected contribution to sea level rises from the Greenland ice sheet . Earlier research from ice2sea found changes in surface melting of the ice sheet will be the major factor in sea level rise contributions from Greenland. Professor David Vaughan, ice2sea co-ordinator based at the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge, said: ‘This is important work but it's no reason for complacency. While this work shows that the process of lubrication of ice flow by surface melting is rather insignificant, our projections are still that Greenland will be a major source of future sea-level rise. ‘As we have reported earlier this year, run-off of surface melt water directly into the ocean and increased iceberg calving are likely to dominate.’","Scientists feared water .

"An autistic man trapped in a world of silence who can only speak a few words has stunned his family by singing, and has now released an album. Kyle Coleman, 27, was diagnosed with 'classic autism' aged three, but soon retreated into a world of his own, stopped speaking, and to this day has never uttered a full sentence. Kyle was almost completely non-verbal until 2009 when his mother took him to a musical therapy session and he started singing along to his favourite songs in pitch-perfect harmony. Scroll down for video . Kyle Coleman, 27, has released an album of original songs despite being a non-verbal autistic who has never uttered a full sentence and has been virtually mute for his entire adult life . Kyle was diagnosed with autism aged three, and eventually stopped speaking. However he showed a natural affinity with music, and first sung aged six (pictured) but suddenly stopped . Kyle, of Gwithian, Cornwall, has now spent hours in a recording studio and is releasing an album of original material. Caroline said: 'Singing is his turn to be heard. He will feel a song rather than think it. Kyle is so much calmer and more at peace now. 'About three years ago, on a scale of ten, his anxiety level was around nine - I would say it's about three now. 'It's opened a dialogue that makes Kyle and I more connected. He used to be very distant - autism can create a fortress around a person. Kyle's gift for singing was unlocked in 2009 when he started music therapy and began singing along to his favourite songs . 'But he pays attention when he is singing. He sleeps well, his tolerance levels are much better, and he's been able to make friends for the first time. 'It is kind of awe inspiring. Song has unlocked this innate, built-in gift that he had. It has taken Kyle to another level. 'What is the most breath taking thing is that he can put his own stamp on songs. He is extraordinary.' Kyle showed an early affinity with music, and first sang aged six or seven with a clumsy rendition of 'Walking in the Air' from the Christmas classic The Snowman. Caroline's ex-husband, who died in a motorbike accident, used to be a musician and she credits Kyle's musical ability to him. But suddenly Kyle stopped singing. After years of silence mother-of-three Caroline took him to Cornwall Music Therapy Trust in Redruth where Kyle's talent was finally unlocked. Caroline recalls how he came home, ran upstairs, got his favourite CDs and started singing along while playing the tune on his keyboard. Encouraged by his therapist, Caroline took Kyle along to a local recording studio where he produced an album of cover version of his favourite Inide songs which was released in 2012. His new album, Beyond the Syntax - referring to the difficulty autistic people have with ordering words - made its debut to coincide with World Autism Awareness Day on April 2. It is a collection of 12 original songs - including Standing On Solid Ground - with most the the lyrics penned by his mother, who used to sing in her youth. Kyle released his first album in 2012 featuring cover versions of Indie songs, but has now released an album of original tracks which were penned by mother Caroline who also used to sing in her youth . Mother-of-three Caroline says music has provided Kyle with a way to communicate and make friends. She says he is now much less anxious and that singing has brought them together . To coincide with the record's release, Kyle has also starred in his own music video, with some shots filmed in the busy high street near his home, a nerve-wracking ordeal for him which Caroline would have been unthinkable even a few months ago. The LP is a collaboration between Kyle, Caroline and recording studio owner John, 42, a guitarist and producer based in Plymouth, Devon. John, who sets the lyrics to music, said: 'It was clear straight away that he was really good.' To coincide with the release of his first single Kyle also starred in a music video, including some shots recorded in a city centre, which his mother said would have been unthinkable even a few months ago .","Kyle Coleman was diagnosed with 'common autism' aged three .

"This is the adorable portrait of Davion Navar Henry Only taken when he was seven years old and looking for a family to adopt him. Eight years later, aged 15, Davion is still looking and still waiting. The heartbreaking insight into a child's life in foster care emerged after Davion, who recently discovered his mother had died, went to a Florida church congregation last month and asked if someone would please adopt him. The boy's moving plea has sparked an incredible reaction online with close to 300,000 people reading his story on MailOnline and his foster home being inundated with 300 calls from potential adoptive parents across America. The interest in Davion's case began in September when he nervously stood before worshippers at St Mark's Missionary Baptist Church and said: 'My name is Davion and I've been . in foster care since I was born... I know God hasn't given up on me. So I'm not giving up either. Searching his whole life: Davion Navar Henry Only, pictured in 2005 when he was just 7 years old. Davion, who lives in Florida, is now 15 and still looking for a family to adopt him . 'I'll take anyone. Old or . young, dad or mom, black, white, purple. I don't care. And I would be . really appreciative. The best I could be.' Since he made his moving speech, Davion's story has gone viral. The story has been viewed close to 300,000 times, shared by around 1,500 people on MailOnline's Facebook page and received nearly 5,000 likes. It has also been tweeted nearly 1,000 times since it was published on Wednesday. Terri Durdaller, spokesman for Florida Department of Children and Families Suncoast region, told MailOnline today that Davion's foster home had received at least 300 calls about him. She added: 'We're hopeful that we can connect Davion with his forever family.' Davion told ABC today: 'If you can, reach out and get me and love me until I die.' The 15-year-old, who will age out of the foster care system in under three years, said that he wants a family that can be his for life. He added: 'I just want people to love me for who I am and to grab me and keep me in their house and love me no matter what.' Photographer Tim Boyles, took Davion's picture for adoption charity the Heart Gallery in 2005 and again earlier this year. He told MailOnline today: 'It broke my heart to photograph Davion a second . time. It had been eight years since I first photographed him for the . Heart Gallery. 'He had grown up into such a fine, young man from the cute, . little boy he was in 2005, but one thing hadn't changed.  Davion was still . living in group homes and foster care.' Davion's portrait is one of many in the Heart Gallery - an organization which helps children in foster care find moms and dads. Davion had a second picture taken for his adoption profile when he was 15 where he describes his love of basketball and cartoons along with his desire for a family who are 'nice and fun' Each child has a short profile on the site telling prospective parents something about who they are. Each article begins with an ID number from the foster care system and the words 'I am available'. Davion, . who is pictured smiling on the beach and throwing a basketball in the . air, writes that his favorite school subject is science and that when he . grows up he wants to be a police officer. He . likes to eat 'Chinese Food or Buffets' and enjoys football and . basketball along with video games, hand held games, cards and watching . Cartoon Network. When it comes to his friends, Davion looks for those . who are true to themselves and to him. On . his ideal family, the teenager says he doesn't care if the people are . rich or poor or what ethnic background they are from. He would like a . family 'who are nice, fun and that know how to cook!' The 15-year-old also gives a short description of what he is like for any family out there. Davion writes that he is: 'Nice and fun and would be happy to be adopted! Davion says the nicest thing he has ever done is a save a boy from drowning.' Davion Navar Henry Only told the congregation at Florida's St Mark's Missionary Baptist Church that he didn't mind who the parents were who adopted him because he would be 'really appreciative' Davion Only, 15, gets some last-minute help with his tie from his case worker Connie Going before nervously making his speech before the congregation . Sadly, Davion's story of lifetime in . foster care is far from unique in the U.S. There are currently 399,548 children in the system across America, many being cared for by . devoted, temporary parents, and yet lacking in a definite place they can . call home. There are many older teenagers like Davion but fewer than 10 per cent of children adopted from foster care are between 14 and 17. Davion himself knows how hard it is to find a family - indeed it was his idea to approach the St . Petersburg church to find his own adoptive parents and take control of . his future. In three years time when he turns 18, he is aware that he . will be on his own. Davion will turn 16 on February 12, 2014. The average number of children who age out of the U.S. foster care system each year is 20,000. Last month, Davion spoke quietly in front of the full pews at the Florida church wearing an over-sized, donated suit that had come from his latest foster home. Davion Only's profile on the Heart Gallery is one of many children who are searching for a permanent home . Davion's profile has been on the Heart Gallery for eight years, since his first photograph was taken at seven years old . The boy was born while his mother was in jail and has spent his entire childhood in countless foster homes. He told his caseworker Connie Going that he knows his adoptive parents are out there somewhere. In June, Davion had come to terms with the death of his mother after he used his birth certificate to search for her for the first time on a computer at his local library. He found her mugshot from her arrests for petty theft and cocaine. And then he found her obituary. La-Dwina Ilene 'Big Dust' McCloud had died aged 55 in Clearwater, Florida just weeks before. He cried in the library when he read that his mother had died and remembered thinking to himself: 'This is ridiculous. How did I not know?' The 15-year-old has spent the past few years at Carlton Manor residential group home in Eckerd, living with 12 other teenage boys, all suffering their own problem. Looking for a family: 15-year-old Davion spoke to the church congregation about how badly he wanted a family to care about him . Davion longs to play football but has no one to take him to practice; to be able to use the bathroom without someone unlocking a door. He would like the light left on when he sleeps and a bed that he can call his own. The 15-year-old has had . behavioral problems - struggling with his own anger at the circumstances . in which he finds himself. Dealing . with his mother's death has led Davion to believe that he doesn't want . to be angry anymore - he wants to discover a better life. Davion told ABC: 'I'm not going to use all my bad stuff that happened to me as an excuse, but I'm going to use it as motivation to push me more and give me more courage.' He . has spent the summer studying hard in 10th grade - achieving As in all . but one subject - geometry. He has lost 40lb and tries to let go of his . anger. Davion also has . support from his mentor Richard Prince, 22. The two were paired up . through the One Church One Child program and usually go to a park to . play basketball or talk. Floyd Watkins, program manager at Davion's group home, told Naplesnews: 'He's come a long way. He's starting to . put himself out there, which is hard when you've been rejected so many . times.'

"It has been ‘officially extinct’ for decades, but two British scientists have set off across the world to hunt for the curious animal known as the Tasmanian tiger. The last known tiger died in captivity in a Tasmanian zoo in 1936, but a team of enthusiasts believe there is still a chance that several of the animals might still be roaming the forested regions of the island state. British scientists Dr Chris Clark and Richard Freeman, who have searched for giant anacondas in Africa and the Indonesian equivalent of Bigfoot, are due to arrive in Tasmania today to join an expedition searching for the tiger, which has a dog-like appearance and a striped body. The last known tiger died in captivity in a Tasmanian zoo in 1936, but a team of enthusiasts believe there is still a chance that several of the animals might still be roaming the forested regions of the island state . ‘This is very serious and we’re putting aside all the other crazy things like Bigfoot hunts and concentrating very much on getting the first convincing evidence that the Tasmanian tiger still exists,’ expedition leader Mike Williams told the MailOnline from the search base in the island capital, Hobart. While there have been reported sightings of the tiger, known scientifically as a thylacine, Mr Williams said the evidence has never been strong enough to be convincing. ‘The problem with a lot of the sightings from members of the public is that they’re generally caught by surprise and their photos are taken on things like mobile phones and aren’t very good. ‘It will take really good quality video to really convince anyone so we’ve brought as much gear as we can to improve our chances of being ready if we do see one.’ Dr Clark and Mr Freeman, from Britain’s Centre for Fortean Zoology, have explored many of the world’ outstanding mysteries and remain dedicated to cryptozoology - the study of unknown animals. The centre is based in an old country house in Devon, parts of which are over 200 years old, and which is said to be home to several ghosts. The Tasmanian tiger features strongly as a ‘most wanted’ animal among the centre’s members - a picture of one is used as the group’s emblem. British scientists Dr Chris Clark and Richard Freeman, who have searched for giant anacondas in Africa and the Indonesian equivalent of Bigfoot, are due to arrive in Tasmania today to join an expedition searching for the tiger (pictured) The British researchers, along with Mr Williams and his expedition members, will be searching densely forested areas in the island’s north and south west. ‘If we didn’t think there was even a slim chance of stumbling upon evidence in the form of droppings, hair or footage then we wouldn’t have committed to this expedition,’ said Mr Williams. ‘Thylacine sightings are still being reported right across the state of Tasmania, 27 years after it was declared extinct by the Tasmanian government.’ The team will be using two powerful four-wheel-drive vehicles which will be loaded with cameras, dashboard video cameras and powerful binoculars. The thylacine is believed to have roamed the Australian mainland in ancient times before it became extinct there about 2,000 years ago - but it continued to thrive in Tasmania. But the arrival of Europeans sealed its fate. The animal was hunted for its fur and because it was responsible for attacks on settlers’ sheep, resulting in alarming photographs showing gunmen standing proudly beside the corpses of piles of animals they had shot down. With the death of the last known tiger - referred to as Benjamin - in the Hobart zoo in 1936, all that has remained of the elusive animal in recent times has been reported sightings in isolated parts of Tasmania. While there have been reported sightings of the tiger, known scientifically as a thylacine, the scientists said the evidence has never been strong enough to be convincing .","The last known Tasmanian tiger - called Benjamin - died in captivity in Hobart Zoo on the island state in 1936 .

"Horrifying photos have emerged which appear to show young children starving to death in Syria as a result of a nine-month seige of their town. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based group that . collects information from a network of anti-regime activists in Syria, posted images of two young boys believed to have died at the weekend from marasmus, a type of severe malnutrition that can very quickly lead to . death if not treated. Although the clips have not been independently verified, one of the boy's is believed to be  Ibrahim Khalil, 4, from Mouadamiya, a rebel-held Damascus suburb. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

Disturbing: The harrowing image depicts the true extent of his starvation showing his sunken cheekbones and  with tiny ribs protruding from his emaciated frame . Posting the photos on its Facebook page the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights wrote that it 'urgently calls on the Syrian Red Crescent and the Red Cross, as well as all aid and relief organisations working in Syria, to work on immediately negotiation to break the siege and supply the tens of thousands of civilians in the besieged parts of Mou'adamiya the vital food and medical equipment.' Opposition activist Ahmed Al-Muadami  said the town has been under siege by Syrian troops since last November. 'We ran out of food supplies and we cannot get anything into the town,' he told CNN. Displaced: Syrian refugees arrive at the Turkish Cilvegozu gate border earlier today . Determined: 'The suffering of civilians in Syria has now reached unprecedented levels, and there appears to be no end in sight,' said Magne Barth, head of the ICRC¿s delegation in the country . Flee: Many Syrians are desperate to leave the country and today the head of the U.N. refugee agency in Syria says seven million Syrians, or almost one-third of the population, have been displaced by the country's civil war . 'We haven't seen a piece of bread for six months now,' said another resident, Abu Alnour. 'We went through our food supplies, local produce and cattle.' Mr Alnour said government checkpoints and snipers are blocking all the roads leading into the town and are not allowing anything in or out. Last week the International Committee of the Red Cross reported severe shortages of vital medical supplies, food and water in a number of areas that have been sealed off for months and are not open to aid access. 'The suffering of civilians in Syria has now reached unprecedented levels, and there appears to be no end in sight,' said Magne Barth, head of the ICRC’s delegation in the country. 'Further escalation will likely trigger more displacement and add to humanitarian needs, which are already immense,' said Mr Barth.

Many Syrians are desperate to leave the country and today the head of the U.N. refugee agency in Syria says 7million Syrians - almost one-third of the population - have been displaced by the war. Tarik Kurdi said that 5million of the displaced are still in Syria while about 2million have fled to neighboring countries. He says 2million children are among those directly affected by the war. Kurdi says U.N. assistance has been a 'drop in the sea of humanitarian need' and that the funding gap is 'very, very wide.' He says international donors have sent less than one-third of the money needed to help those displaced by the war.

"Australia 108 will be the tallest tower to roofline in the southern hemisphere when it is completed in 2019 . Melbourne architects have received the green-light to build a 100-storey skyscraper, which will be the tallest apartment block in the southern hemisphere. At 319 metres high the tower, Australia 108, will be the highest residential tower in the southern hemisphere, when it is completed in 2019, beating out Melbourne's Eureka tower by 22 metres. The Q1 Gold Coast building beats the Australia 108 because of a spire which reaches 323 metres, but the Melbourne building will have the tallest roof line. It will also be the tallest habitable building in the country, with apartments up to the 100th level, whereas the Q1 only has 71 habitable levels. Australia 108 received Victorian State Government approval today and construction should commence in mid-2015 and be completed in 2019, costing an estimated $900 million to build. The building had to undergo a dramatic re-design last year when the original 388 metre-high design was found to breach air safety regulations. The building, designed by Fender Katsalidis Architects, will contain 1,105 luxury apartments, as well as retail tenancies, a multi-level carpark and communal facilities for residents, including pool, gym, sauna, steam room and private theatre. The building features 'golden starbursts' at levels 70 and 71, which are meant to complement the 'golden crown' of the nearby Eureka Building, also designed by Fender Katsalidis. The 'starbursts' house luxury services accessible to residents, including infinity pools that overlook Melbourne form a height of 210 metres. The tower will be built on the south bank of Melbourne on a site bought in December 2013 by Aspial's World Class Land, a Singapore based developer.

"Facing jail: Mother Cathy Watson, 44,  stole her disabled daughter's compensation money to live like a lottery winner . A mother who stole her disabled . daughter’s compensation money to live like a lottery winner was told . yesterday she faces a long prison sentence. Cathy . Watson, 44, plundered the £2.6million medical negligence payout in a . case that exposed shocking failings by the Court of Protection. She . and her ex-husband Robert Hills, 49, paid for houses, cars, holidays . and even cosmetic surgery using money that the COP was responsible for . ensuring was spent appropriately. Yesterday Watson was found guilty of theft and transferring criminal property. Hills admitted theft and gave evidence against his ex-wife. They . were charged with stealing more than £500,000 from daughter Samantha . Svendsen, now 29, but in reality they spent a lot more. Hills . met Watson when she was a 19-year-old single mother and legally adopted . Samantha, who suffered brain damage at birth and has cerebral palsy. After years of legal wrangling, Samantha received the massive payout in 1999, when she was 15. She is wheelchair-bound, cannot speak or feed herself and needs help 24 hours a day. The cash was intended to pay for her lifetime of care. But a police source estimated that only ‘four to seven years’ of money remains and the taxpayer will then have to fund her care. The trial at Doncaster Crown Court raised worrying questions about the COP. It . has jurisdiction over the affairs of people who lack mental capacity to . make decisions for themselves, with most hearings being held in . private. Watson was given . the authority to deal with Samantha’s finances and interests by the COP . through its administrative arm at the time, the Public Guardianship . Office. Robert Hills (left), 49, had previously pleaded guilty to four theft . offences for his part in the crime. Watson (right) was convicted by a . jury at Doncaster Crown Court yesterday . Hills played a major role in the decisions even though he has 26 convictions, many for dishonesty, and once served a 21-month jail term. Despite this, COP officials in London failed to spot the extravagant spending. Watson spent £12,000 on breast enlargement surgery and liposuction, and at least £82,000 on a failed business venture. Initially they complied with rules to account for their spending. When they stopped, the COP sent Watson warning letters which she ignored. In 2000 the couple bought their council house in Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, for £22,000. In . 2002 they persuaded the COP to send them £56,000 for the purchase. It . was unaware they already owned it – as a simple Land Registry search . would have revealed. Property scam: One of the houses the couple sold before spending the proceeds . Hills admitted stealing £137,950 from the proceeds of selling a property in Laceby, Lincolnshire, while Watson was yesterday found guilty of stealing £145,000 from the sale of a house next door (pictured) Another £156,000 was later transferred to buy two adjoining properties in Laceby, near Grimsby. The pair sold them and spent the proceeds. All three houses should have been registered in Samantha’s name by order of the COP but were not. Officials had no idea their instructions had been disregarded and in 2004 the COP sanctioned the purchase of a holiday villa in Florida and sent £235,000 to the couple. But they began divorce proceedings and spent the cash. Watson’s dishonesty came to light when she wanted to put Samantha into a care home and go holiday. They fell out, social services became involved and police began an investigation in 2010. Yesterday Watson was told by Judge Jacqueline Davies, who adjourned sentence, that she faces a ‘significant’ jail term. One of the trial lawyers said the COP had not ‘covered themselves in glory’ and Liberal Democrat MP John Hemming said the case was one of a number of COP failings. ‘When the watchdog is asleep and doesn’t bark then the system fails,’ he said. ‘The Government needs to review the operations of the public guardian.’ Watson was cleared of a theft charge relating to £53,850 received from the Court Of Protection that was supposed to be spent on buying a property in Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire. Hills admitted an offence relating to the property (pictured)","Cathy Watson took money from her daughter's compensation fund .

"Jason Trigg, a 26-year-old software programmer, graduated with top honors from the vaunted Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His education and skills mean he could work nearly anywhere. He chooses to work on Wall Street, earning six figures designing software for a high-frequency trading firm. There, his earning potential is all but unlimited. Trigg's life goal is to earn as much money as he possibly can, but it's not so he can buy expensive cars, luxury homes and designer clothing. He wants to save the world and he believes that the more money he makes, the more good he can do. Modest: Jason Trigg, 26, says he donated half of his six-figure income from working at a high-frequency trading firm to charity . The Washington Post reports that last year, he gave half his salary - tens of thousands of dollars - away to the Against Malaria Foundation. The charity estimates that $2,500 can save one life. By that calculus, Trigg figures he can save more lives earning a vast salary in finance that he could if he dedicated his life to public service. He's not alone. A core of idealistic young professionals have joined Wall Street banks, hedge funds, and major tech companies that pay large salaries, all with the idea that their best chance of making the world a better place is earning as much money as possible - and then putting that money to good use. 'A lot of people, they want to make a difference and end up in the . Peace Corps and in the developing world without running water,' Trigg . told the Post. 'I can donate some of my time in the office and make more of a difference.' Despite Trigg's high-paying job, he lives with three roommates and . walks to work every day. He tries to live as conservatively as possible. The most good: Trigg donates most of his earnings to the Against Malaria Foundation, which says it can save a life for $2,500 . 'I wouldn’t know how to spend a large amount of money,' he says. Charities like GiveWell and 80,000 Hours - a reference to the number of working hours in a career - have been established to help civic-minded young people make choices about their lives and careers that will help the most people. Nearly all of the charities focus on improving health conditions in the developing world - since money sent to poor countries can go much farther than any donations made to help Americans. 'You can pay to provide and train a guide dog for a blind American, which costs about $40,000,' Matt Wage, a Princeton graduate who works in finance, told the Washington Post. 'But with that money you could also cure between 400 and 2,000 people in developing countries of blindness from glaucoma, which costs about $20 per person.' Wage says he gives about half of his incomes to charities that work in Africa and Asia. Jeff Kaufman, who works as a programmer for Google, tells the Post that he and his wife lived on $10,000 last year. They allowed themselves just $165 a month for groceries and a mere $38 a week each of non-essential spending, including eating out. Together they gave away 45percent of their income.

"Newcastle have won the race to sign MK Dons teenager Dele Alli. Sportsmail understands the Magpies will complete the signing of the 18-year-old midfielder this week for a fee of £4million, rising to £5m with add-ons. Alli, though, will be loaned back to the League One club for the remainder of the season. MK Dons teenage midfielder Dele Alli (right) is expected to sign for Newcastle this week . The England Under 19 star has also attracted interest from the likes of Liverpool and Arsenal . The highly-rated England Under 19 international – who was attracting interest from Arsenal and Liverpool - broke into the senior side two seasons ago and has scored 18 times from 71 appearances. Speaking at the weekend, MK Dons boss Karl Robinson said: ‘He can be as good as he wants to be, he has got everything. He is special.’ Newcastle struck a similar deal with Nottingham Forest in the summer following the signings of goalkeeper Karl Darlow and defender Jamaal Lascelles. They will join Alli on Tyneside when the club report for pre-season training in July.

"It may have only been a matter of weeks since Mayor of London Boris Johnson was left suspended precariously above the capital in a comical zip wire malfunction during the Olympics. But Mr Johnson could be looking to take to the skies once again, this time on his bike, as he considers an architect's proposals for a network of elevated cycle paths between London's mainline stations. Spectacular artist's impressions of what the city's raised cycle network - given a working name of SkyCycle - could look like were released this week along with the first details of the project. Scroll down for video . London Mayor Boris Johnson is considering architect Sam Martin's designs for SkyCycle, a bike network above the capital's streets. An artist's impression is shown . The scheme is designed to make cycling safer for the increasing numbers choosing to take their bike to work . Drawings showing a futuristic raised . glass open-top tunnel, that have drawn comparisons with New York's High . Line, could become a reality as soon as 2015. Sam . Martin, 43, the landscape architect who came up with the idea with a . colleague two years ago, said discussions between the Mayor and Network . Rail were 'going well' since an initial meeting in May and that . feasibility studies over potential sites were already underway. He . stressed that plans were at an early stage, but the proposal was . focused on commuters who would pay to use the network with an Oyster . card. SkyCycle could become a reality above the streets of London as soon as 2015 . Mr Martin, director of Exterior . Architecture, who admits to giving up cycling in London because he found . it too dangerous added that the raised network was the only option left . to expand cycling in London. He said: 'TfL estimate the . number of journeys made by bike will treble to around 1.5 million by . 2020. Where are they meant to go? SkyCycle is the next logical step, . because you can’t realistically build more cycle lanes on ground level. 'You have to start knocking down . buildings and there will always be the problem of traffic. It will be . less safe than it is now and you can’t persuade people to get on bikes . as it is even if you keep raising taxes on cars.' He added: 'Boris loves the idea and . Network Rail are really positive about it. I sincerely believe it could . be the next significant piece of London infrastructure and would . transform the capital. 'It has been compared to New York’s High Line, . which I am familiar with, but the reality is this is a completely . different concept. 'In New York it is mainly pedestrian and primarily for tourists and uses converted disused railway lines. Boris Johnson, right, is considering architect Sam Martin's ambitious SkyCycle design . 'We are talking about new . infrastructure for commuters that guarantees safety and will be quicker . than taking public transport. It is a much more ambitious and . expensive.' The drawings show a bold red and blue design incorporating a helix structure partly encasing the raised platform above London. Martin believes that a corporate sponsor similar to the Barclays-backed cycle hire scheme would be needed to help fund the project, which he said would cost 'tens of millions of pounds' and take around two years to build. It is thought the first route could be built on the Olympic regeneration of east London, linking Stratford with the City of London through Liverpool and Fenchurch Street stations but this has yet to be confirmed . It is envisaged that cyclists could pay around £1 per journey, making it significantly cheaper to use than public transport - around the third of the cost of a regular commute. Sam Martin, 43, hopes that his design will make London safer for cyclists . There would also be the need for more cycle storage and ramps at stations. Despite suggestions, Martin said the proposed network would not exclusively use old railway lines but would require new infrastructure build alongside or above tracks in some places. The problem of negotiating with different landowners is to be overcome by using leasing land owned by Network Rail. The SkyCycle idea has drawn comparisons with New York's High Line, pictured, which uses the city's old railway lines as walkways . Speaking about the idea recently Boris Johnson MP described it as 'very interesting'. He said: 'There is a proposal, which is very interesting, to hook up mainline stations in London along the side of raised railway tracks, with a new cycle path.' According to TfL, there were twice the number of cyclists in London in 2010 compared to 2000, sparking numerous campaigns for improvements to make cycling safer in the capital.","First phase of SkyCycle would link Stratford with City of London by 2015 .

"Just six months since Google unveiled designs of its Project Ara handsets, engineers have already created the first working prototype. Dubbed Spiral 1, an engineer is shown turning on the device, unlocking it and launching an app during a video filmed at NK Labs in Boston. Individual modules are shown being added to, and removed, from the handset including the LED module, battery, processor, speaker, and a USB port. Scroll down for video . Dubbed Spiral 1, the device (pictured) is demonstrated during a video filmed at NK Labs in Boston. Individual modules are shown being added to, and removed, from the handset including the LED module, battery, processor, speaker, and a USB port . 'The first step is figuring out how is this is going to work,' explained the creative agency. 'What are going to be the functions of the different parts of the system? And then from there, we select specific components and draw schematics.' According to the developer kit, Ara phones will be able run on multiple batteries - when one battery dies, it can be detached and replaced with a full battery module. Each phone . will have a central 'spine' and an endoskeleton - nicknamed 'endo' - . made of ribs that the individual modules will clip on to. There will be three different sized . endos - including mini, medium and large - to rival the existing range of . phones currently on the market, from compacts to phablets. Larger phones will be able to accomodate either larger, or additional modules, than the mini will. Google's kit describes various modules including batteries, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips, cameras, speakers and more. In theory, any sensor that can be fitted to a module will be able to attach to a module and while Google will make the shell, these modules will be made by other companies. By printing their own parts, users will also be able to customise them. 'Once you have a layout, you get the boards fabricated. 'It’s magical when you open up the box and say ""oh my goodness, that’s the thing we’ve spent all these months designing."" The firm continued that when the power is applied for the first time to the modules, it's what is known as the Smoke Test. 'Your primary thought at that point is, is this thing going to start smoking?' continued the engineer. 'Is it going to overheat? Is there some critical error or not? And then, once we have the individual pieces working we put them into the complete system.' In the video, a board is shown fitted with connectors. The designers then demonstrate sliding the components in and out. In the Spiral 1 prototype, 50 per cent of the phone is taken up by the modules, but Toshiba has made custom chips for Spiral 2, which the company said will increase the amount of space on the device. Spiral 2 will be demonstrated at a developer’s conference on 14 January. According to the developer kit files released in April, Ara phones will be able run on multiple batteries - when one battery dies, it can be detached and replaced with a full battery module. Lower-resolution cameras can be swapped with higher-res versions, and users will be also be able to 3D print replacement parts.

"The father of a little girl trapped under 25 feet of dirt while playing with her cousin desperately pleaded with authorities to hurry after he witnessed the accident last night, according to a newly-released 911 call. Distraught dad Jordan Arwood can be heard sobbing as he tells the dispatcher: 'Get everybody you can, l mean everybody.' The call was released hours after workers have recovered the bodies of six-year-old Chloe Jade Arwood and seven-year-old James Levi Caldwell, who were buried alive under dirt at a construction site in North Carolina on Sunday afternoon.

"Texas Governor Rick Perry toured the U.S.-Mexico border today without President Barack Obama, who ultimately decided to return to Washington, D.C. this afternoon after making a pit stop for BBQ in Austin. Perry's office says he took a boat ride down the Rio Grande river and a chopper tour of the Rio Grande Valley with the Texas Department of Public Safety this afternoon. Meanwhile, President Obama spoke at a Democratic Party fundraiser, met with someone who wrote him a letter and gave remarks on the economy before stopping by Franklin Barbeque, where he dropped more than $300 on food for his staff and people he cut in line. In this photo, posted to the Texas Governor's office's official twitter account, Rick Perry tours the U.S.-Mexico border with the Texas Department of Safety . Perry tweeted out this photo from his boat ride this afternoon with the caption, 'Dept of Public Safety patrolling the Rio Grande. Keeping Texas safe!!' Perry's office says he took an aerial tour of the border as well as a boat tour . Perry repeatedly invited the president to visit the border with him, including during a face-to-face meeting yesterday, but the White House declined, saying the updates Obama was receiving from administration officials who had been down there were good enough. 'The first thing I asked him when I got on to Air Force One,' Perry told Fox News' Sean Hannity last night after his meeting with Obama, is if he would come to the border. 'I said Mr. President, I said,' ""I really want you to come and see this cause this is important for you to absorb as a father, but more importantly as the President of the United States to see the humanitarian crisis and to also understand how you can move the border patrol forward, away from the 45 miles or so back they are today to be right on the border to see what the Department of Public Safety is doing with our gun boats in the river to stop the criminal activity that's going on.'That's what the president needs to see,' Perry continued. 'He needs to understand instinctively and intuitively and with his own two eyes what’s going on on the border.' Perry said Obama was only . 311 miles from border town McAllen, Texas, which doesn't take . long to get to in a plane.'Air Force One's a pretty fast ride,' he said. At a press conference in Austin his meeting with Perry, Obama said he was 'not interested in photo ops.' 'Nothing has taken place down there that I'm not intimately aware of,' the president said. 'This is not theater.' Perry characterized the president's decision not to join him as a mistake of monumental proportions. 'I think about the criticism that Goerge W. Bush received when he didn't . go to New Orleans [right after Hurricane] Katrina,' Perry told Hannity, piggybacking off of fellow Texas lawmaker Henry Cuellar's comments earlier this week that Obama's refusal to visit the border could be his 'Katrina moment.' 'This is no different,' Perry said. 'I'm pretty sure that if George Bush had said, well, I sent my FEMA director down multiple times that he would have still been criticized greatly because you need to go.' President Barack Obama jokes with patrons at Franklin Barbeque as he hands over his credit card to pay for $300 of food he bought for his staff and two patrons he cut in front of in line . Obama made a surprise visit to the Austin, Texas, restaurant before heading to the airport to fly back to Washington, D.C. After several weeks of public back and forth about the Obama administration's handling of the situation along the portion of the border that the U.S. shares with Texas, Perry and the president put aside their differences yesterday and met to discuss the Texas governor's concerns. Both Perry and the president said the meeting went well, and Perry told Hannity the president seemed to 'philosophically' agree with him on the need to secure the border. 'I may have been a bit of a thorn in his side over the years,' he said, 'but I've tried to do it in a respectful way and a thoughtful way. And what I think is right for the people of Texas, and in this case, what's right for America.' In a letter to the president today, Perry said he hoped their meeting was 'the beginning of a productive diaologue' and reiterated what actions he'd like to see the federal government take moving forward. Those include: the deployment of 1,000 National Groups to the border, medical screenings for all illegal immigrants who come to the U.S. and changes to a federal law that disallows unaccompanied children from countries other than Mexico or Canada who cross the border illegally to be sent home immediately. 'Additionally, Mr. President, I cannot stress enough how important it is for you to visit the borderto witness the damage that the failure to secure the border is doing to our country and to demonstrate for all Americans, as well as the governments of Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, your commitment to ending this humanitarian crisis,' Perry wrote. 'Your visit would also provide an ideal opportunity to meet with the Texas Congressional Delegation to discuss þermanent solutions to our border security issues. 'Because this issue deserves swift action, I am available to help facilitate this meeting with the delegation.' Perry's office did not respond to MailOnline's request for comment on additional details about Perry's tour of the border today.","President Barack Obama spent the last day and a half in Texas, raising money for his political party and holding official events .

"Britain's rotten summer hit a new low last night as it suffered its coldest August evening in 40 years - but that didn't stop children making the most of their last few days off from school. Despite some areas dropping to below -2C last night, surfers were out in force today, while children happily splashed around in the waves at Tynemouth Beach in North Tyneside. The pre-school rush left roads busy this evening as parents travelled home from their holidays in preparation for their children returning to school next week. Scroll down for video . Braving the cold: Thrill seekers make the most of the final day of summer by going for a dip in the chilly sea at Tynemouth Beach in North Tyneside . Coldest August in 40 years: The surfers at Tynemouth Beach in North Tyneside didn't seem to mind the poor weather . It comes after a disappointing summer that has been the wettest in a century. The Highlands, Aberdeenshire and . Northumberland had a frost overnight while most parts of the UK were . close to freezing as most Britons shivered in their beds. Braemar in Scotland was the coldest spot as it dropped to -2.1C (28.22 Fahrenheit), followed by Aviemore near Loch Ness on -1.8C and -0.7C in north-east England. The only night that was colder came on August 21 1973, when Lagganlia in the Highlands dropped to -4.5C. But outside the Highlands some weather stations are likely to have had record lows for their areas. Bradford in West Yorkshire had its coldest August night since records began in 1908 at 2.8C. School's out: Children spend the last few days of their summer holiday playing on Tynemouth Beach before heading back to school next week . Winter stroll: The scene at Tynemouth Beach looked more like winter than a summer's day . As this unseasonal chill swept across the . UK it coincided with an astronomical phenomenon - a blue moon. This . means there will be two full moons in a month, with one at the start of . August and another today. The . temperatures, which reflect the country's cold and soggy weather over . recent months, have proved this summer has been a complete write-off. It came as it was revealed yesterday the summer has also been the wettest in England and Wales for a century. Unusual cold winds have dragged down the temperature over night, experts said today. 'Last night saw northerly winds drag cold air from quite a long way north over the UK. This air was also dry, which meant there was very little moisture to help retain heat from the day,' a Met Office spokesman said. 'This, combined with clear skies caused by the high pressure sitting over the country, meant all the heat radiated into the sky – leaving very cold temperatures for the time of year.' Once in a blue moon: The full moon this Friday morning over Saddleworth Moor following the coldest August night in 40 years. The moor was around 2C lat night. Rare: This Blue Moon seen over the M62 motorway this morning is very unusual - as it is the second full moon this month . The miserable temperatures top off a terrible summer. Braemar, Aberdeenshire: -2.4 °CAviemore, Highlands: -1.8 °CRedesdale Camp, Northumberland: -0.7 °CBainbridge, North Yorkshire: 0.5 °CBenson, Oxfordshire: 2.1 °CBradford, West Yorkshire: 2.8 °C . Data released by MeteoGroup, the weather division of the Press Association, showed that 14.25ins or 362mm of rain fell in June, July and August so far, outstripping the previous worst period in 1912. MeteoGroup forecaster Nick Prebble said this summer is set to be the fourth wettest since records began in 1727. June 2012 was the wettest since 1860, had the least sunshine since 1909 and was the coldest since 1991. Mr Prebble said: 'June was wet, dull and cold. It was pretty relentless low pressure, very unsettled weather and a thoroughly miserable month. 'July wasn't as wet as June but it was still wetter than average. 'We haven't quite got to the end of August yet but we're expecting rainfall to be a few millimetres above the average.' MeteoGroup said 14.06in (357mm) of rain has fallen in Scotland during the summer so far, compared with an average of 11.42in (290mm). The night of cold calm last night came after a Tornado, lightning, flash floods and landslides have wreaked havoc across Britain as Mother Nature struck with terrifying force. A frightening twist to the summer: The dramatic tornado hit the seaside town of Clevedon, near Bristol yesterday . Can it get any worse? The freak weather is just one more example of the miserable weather the UK has endured this summer . Homes . and businesses were cleared and temporary shelters set up yesterday as . more than two inches of rain fell in just a few hours across the . North-West. The Environment Agency issued 11 flood alerts across the country. In St Bees, Cumbria’s western-most . point, almost an inch of rain fell in just an hour causing a landslide . which later derailed a train in scenes akin to those wrought by Hurricane Isaac in Louisiana. The 100 passengers on board, mainly . workers heading towards the Sellafield nuclear plant, escaped without . injury after the accident at 6.45am. Crashing disappointment: The Atlantic ocean at full force as Portreath on the North Cornwall coast gave surfers and hoilday makers a sight to remember yesterday, summing up the summer . In Egremont, west Cumbria, up to 150 . homes were hit by flash flooding with the Fire Service saying it had . received 100 calls for help, mainly involving requests for sandbags. And in an illustration of  the weather’s powerful unpredictability, twisters were seen above Clevedon, Somerset. In Pudsey, West Yorkshire, Bernard . Williams, 55, an assistant headmaster, had a lucky escape after . lightning struck a tree as he climbed out of his car. He made it indoors . just seconds before the 40ft-willow came crashing to the ground. The torrential rain caused the cliff face to collapse and washed away the natural inferastructure . A commuter train had a lucky escape this morning after being derailed after a landslip washed away part of the cliff during flash flooding . Downpour: Despite the shock of the impact the train thankfully stayed upright saving the lives of passengers on board. There were no reported injuries to staff or passengers . His wife Alison, 43, said: ‘If  he had . been stood at the car four seconds later he would almost certainly have . been killed or maimed.’ A spokesman for the Met Office said . the worst of the weather had passed and that the next three days are . expected to be relatively dry with only scattered showers. Temperatures will not beas cold this evening, experts have said. 'Cloud and any rain across southeast England will clear, becoming dry. Elsewhere, also becoming mostly dry and fine with showers dying away, . but they will continue around Northern Ireland, western Scotland and . some western coastal areas with a southwesterly breeze,' the Met Office said. The turbulent weather will rekindle . memories of the Jubilee weekend in June, when street parties across the . country were sullied by drizzle. The Thames river pageant also proved a . nightmare for spectators, many of whom travelled to London only to be . drenched by heavy showers. Last weekend's Bank Holiday was also a complete washout, with torrential rain and massive thunder storms sweeping across much of the country. Revellers at the Leeds and Reading Festivals had to brave showers, while others across the country found themselves in a marathon 12-hour deluge. Chaos: Floodwaters surrounded the houses and local shops in the centre of Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire, in June after torrential downpours brought flooding to swathes of northern England . Soaked: Last weekend 80,000 rain soaked revellers enjoyed the Reading Festival despite the weather . Many of us had already rolled the barbecues back into the garden shed, resigned to the fact that the sunshine was over. Roads were busier than usual as parents travelled home from their family summer holidays in preparation for their children returning to school next week. The M25 was the worst affected with queues tailing back to junction 27 and Junction 28 after an accident earlier in the day. The M4 London bound was also heavily congested between junction 8 and 6. The A406, A30 and A13 also had delays. Then the heavens opened – and stayed open in some areas from first thing in the morning to well into the evening on Saturday and continued in some places on the Sunday. Huge events like iconic British sporting events like Wimbledon were also badly hit by bad weather and only the Olympics escaped. Senior forecaster at Meteogroup, Stephen Davenport said: 'It is hard to point the finger at any one cause for such a disappointing summer, or indeed for the fact that this has been pretty much the sixth in a row, with 2006 the last with any lengthy periods of dry and hot weather. 'We can say that the atmospheric circulation around the northern hemisphere has been rather weak for much of the time during those years, and this lends itself to what meteorologists call blocking, whereby a pattern of low and high pressure around the hemisphere becomes locked in for long periods as the jet stream that shapes and holds them loops lazily and extravagantly around the globe. 'It is unfortunate for those wanting to break out the flip-flops and shorts that the British Isles have found themselves under stagnant low pressure rather more often than high pressure.' High point: Only during the Olympics did good weather return, raising spirits, nit just because of the fantastic sport .","On same day Met Office reveal it’s been the wettest summer ever, temperatures plunged to almost record summer lows overnight .

"Mario Balotelli will be hauled over the coals by Brendan Rodgers after he ridiculously swapped shirts with Real Madrid defender Pepe at half-time. On a night when Liverpool's Champions League ambitions were left hanging by a thread after a goal from Cristiano Ronaldo and two from Karim Benzema condemned them to a 3-0 defeat at Anfield, Balotelli came in for huge criticism, especially from the Liverpool Echo. The local publication insisted that Balotelli must apologise to the club to continue his career with the Reds. The striker was taken off after another ineffectual performance and Rodgers, who described the switch as 'tactical', revealed he would be speaking to the Italian, as swapping shirts early is not something of which the manager approves.

'I had a similar incident last year and it was dealt with internally,' said Rodgers. 'It's exactly the same. I heard about it when I came off pitch. If you want to do that, it's something you do at end of the game and something I will deal with. 'I needed more movement centrally to occupy their centre halves and I felt Raheem Sterling's speed would give us that. In the second half you could see every player pressing and working – for us that's the minimum. Lallana came on and did it very well. Raheem played in position a bit alien to him.' Others were more damning of Balotelli. Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher said on Sky: 'I can't change the way I feel about Balotelli and that is nothing to do with what he's done in a Liverpool shirt. It's what he's done at Manchester City and AC Milan. 'Do I think he's going to be here long-term? No, I'd be surprised to see him here next season if I'm being honest. Rafa Benitez was here a few years, bought Robbie Keane and sold him in January. It might not be that quick but I'd be surprised if Mario Balotelli is at the club next season.' Former Liverpool skipper Phil Thompson added: 'I think it's disgraceful. I think it's disrespectful to both players. If you're swapping them, what's the other guy thinking about? You're giving away your shirt at half time, what is in his mind?' Pepe places his hand on Balotelli's back as the forward leaves the field not to return for the second half . Mamadou Sakho (right) swapped shirts with Chelsea's Samuel Eto'o at Stamford Bridge last December . 'He still has a future at Liverpool,' Rush told talkSPORT. 'The fans are some of the most patient, but he has to realise he's playing at Liverpool Football Club, not just any other club. 'He's got to show his commitment to the club by proving it on the pitch. 'The Liverpool fans are very knowledgeable, and you just don't do that (swap shirts at half time). 'I'm sure Brendan Rodgers will have a word with him behind closed doors.' Balotelli's indiscretion, however, should not disguise the fact Liverpool were comfortably beaten by a Real Madrid side that moved ominously through the gears, took advantage of some wretched defending and then easily held them at bay in the second period once the game was won. Rodgers said: 'We started very well, aggressive in pressing and passing and coped very well. Then that period after the first goal to half-time – it was a disappointing first goal and the other two were sloppy. Obviously then 3-0 against a team that's so dangerous is very disappointing.' Madrid are aiming to become the first team in the modern era to retain the Champions League and Ronaldo, who scored the opening goal, said: 'We are thinking step by step and we are going to try to retain it. 'We know it will be very tough, but we are positive and I think it will be possible if we play like that.' Cristiano Ronaldo (2nd left) sent Real Madrid on their way with a brilliant effort to open the scoring .

The Obamas have given a personal insight into their lives . In the hot seat: President Obama and the first lady were interviewed by ABC News' Barbara Walters for a 20/20 holiday special to be aired tonight . ‘He’s got a great life,’ Mrs Obama said of the three-year-old black and white dog. ‘He’s got it good.’ The . Portuguese water dog does indeed have it good. On Wednesday, he got $41 . worth of gifts from PetSmart and there is also speculation that Bo was . flown to Hawaii for the Obama’s family vacation. Asked the same question, President Obama declined to answer, saying: ‘You know, Barbara, I’m going to pass on this one.’ When asked what the trait he most . 'deplored' in himself, President Obama responded: Laziness. Nothing . frustrates me more than when people aren't doing their jobs...if I get . lazy, then I get mad at myself.' A dog's life: Michelle Obama told Barbara Walters she would chose to come back as family dog Bo in her next life . The President also admitted to lying in the interview, but only when the 'truth would hurt other people' He said: 'Usually, the only time I lie is very personal interactions with family members, who you say, ""You look great,"" and they don't. ""Wonderful dress..."" Uh, not so much. The First Lady agreed, saying she would lie when the 'truth was not helpful'.

When Barbara Walters asked President Obama what trait he most deplores in himself, he responded: ‘Laziness. Nothing frustrates me more than when people aren’t doing their jobs.’The comment is especially relevant as Mr Obama is fighting tooth and nail for an extension on the payroll tax cut. He and House Speaker John Boehner have famously clashed on the issue.On Thursday, the president called Washington ‘dysfunctional.’ He added: ‘What’s happening right now is exactly why people get so frustrated with Washington.’ When asked what three words they would use to describe eachother, the Obamas - who will celebrate their 20th anniversary next year- were nothing but complimentary of eachother. The President answered: 'Beautiful, smart and funny' while the First Lady used the words 'Smart, sportsman, and father' to describe her huisband. The President  said he did not have a 'biggest pet peeve' for his wife. But Mrs Obama, on the other hand, had plenty. ‘My list is too long,’ she told Walters. In the interview, the President revealed a deep regret of not having learned a musical instrument and wished he had focused more on Spanish when he was at school.

"Scottish scientists have come up with an intriguing new idea to combat global warming - blasting the surface of asteroids to create giant clouds of dust which would act as sunscreen for the planet. Researchers at the University of Strathclyde believe a suitably sized asteroid could be moved into a position close to earth before a giant cloud of dust is blasted off its surface. And because an asteroid creates a gravitational pull, the dust is held in position rather than being gradually dispersed across space. Solar shield: Scottish scientists believe an asteroid could be moved into position before a giant cloud of dust is blasted from the surface to act as a sunscreen . The idea is the latest in a series of ambitious projects, known as geoengineering, which aim to alter the climate of the planet by reflecting, diverting or absorbing solar radiation. Research by he United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change suggests average global temperatures will increase by between 1.1C and 6.4C by the end of this century. Russell Bewick, one of the research team at the University of Strathclyde told Live Science: 'People sometimes get the idea of giant screens blocking the entire sun. 'This is not the case ... as [the device] is constantly between the sun and the earth, it acts merely as a very light shade or filter.' 'I would like to make it clear that I would never suggest geoengineering in place of reducing our carbon emissions. The asteroid would be moved into position at what is known as Lagrange point L1, a point in space where the gravitational pull of the Sun and the Earth balance each other out . 'We can buy time to find a lasting solution to combat Earth’s climate change. The dust cloud is not a permanent cure, but it could offset the effects of climate change for a given time to allow slow-acting measures like carbon capture to take effect.' An earlier proposal to shade Earth from the sun involved placing giant mirrors in space. However this is seen as impractical due to the massive cost of building the giant mirrors and blasting them into orbit or constructing them in outer-space. Another idea involved using blankets of dust to blot out the sun in the same way clouds do on earth. However while this would be considerably cheaper than placing mirrors in space it is believed the dust would be dispersed due to the gravitational pull of the sun, moon and other planets. So the Scottish team came up with the novel idea of using an asteroid's own gravitational pull to effectively anchor the cloud of dust and stop it drifting away. The asteroid would be placed at what is known as Lagrange point L1, a point in space where the gravitational pull of the sun and the Earth balance each other out. L1 is about four times the distance from Earth to the moon. The asteroid would be fitted with a 'mass driver,' powerful electromagnets that, as well as acting as an engine to maneuver the asteroid into position, could also blast a cloud of dust away from its surface. The researchers have identified the largest near-Earth asteroid, 1036 Ganymed, as a suitable candidate. They believe Ganymed could generate a dust cloud large enough to block out 6.58 per cent of solar radiation reaching earth, more than enough to combat any current levels of global warming. The dust cloud generated would be about 5 quadrillion (5,000,000,000,000,000) kilograms in mass and about 1,600 miles wide. The research team, from the University of Strathclyde, estimate a suitably-sized asteroid could generate a dust cloud large enough to block out 6.58 per cent of solar radiation reaching earth . Mr Bewick said: 'A very large asteroid is a potential threat to Earth, and therefore great care and testing would be required in the implementation of this scenario. 'Due to this, the political challenges would probably match the scale of the engineering challenge. Even for the capture of much smaller asteroids, there will likely be reservations from all areas of society, though the risks would be much less.' The main challenge for the scientists is finding a way of moving such a large asteroid into place. Mr Bewick added: 'The company Planetary Resources recently announced their intention to mine asteroids. 'The study that they base their plans on reckons that it will be possible to capture an asteroid with a mass of 500,000 kilograms by 2025. 'Comparing this to the mass of Ganymed makes the task of capturing it seem unfeasible, at least in everything except the very far term. 'However, smaller asteroids could be moved and clustered at the first Lagrange point.'","Scottish scientists believe an asteroid could be maneuvered into position before a cloud of dust is blasted from the surface .
Because an asteroid has its own gravitational pull, the dust would be anchored in place ."
"With the UN warning sugar could be ‘the new tobacco’ because of its risks to health through obesity, you might think a diet that cuts it out  would get the thumbs up from experts. But a group of scientists has just consigned a trendy sugar-free anti-ageing plan to a list of fad diets it dismisses as a waste of time and money, and potentially dangerous. While dieters can forgo sugar in yoghurt, ready meals, dessert and biscuits, for example, having none at all is almost impossible. Scroll down for video . Cubes: While dieters can forgo sugar in yoghurt, ready meals, dessert and biscuits, for example, having none at all is almost impossible . ‘Cutting all sugar from your diet would be very difficult to achieve,’ said biochemist Leah Fitzsimmons, who even warned that such a drastic approach could be fatal. ‘Fruits, vegetables, dairy products and dairy replacements, eggs, alcohol and nuts all contain sugar, which would leave you with little other than meat and fats to eat – definitely not very healthy.’ The sugar-free diet was one of five assessed by dieticians, biochemists and other experts for the charity Sense About Science. They also dismissed the caveman diet, said to be favoured by actor Matthew McConaughey, which holds that because we evolved eating a limited number of foods, we should return to our evolutionary roots and eat berries, vegetables and lean meat, while eschewing modern fare such as cereals, lentils, beans and dairy products. But archaeologist Erika Nitsch said: ‘While it is true that fluffy white loaves of sandwich bread won’t have been known to our hunter-gatherer ancestors, if you are worried about a healthy diet, have lentil soup, but skip the Mars bar.’ Also rejected were diets that claim to . selectively slim parts of the body by influencing hormones. For . instance, it is said love handles are caused by an insulin imbalance and . can be shrunk by eating less sugar. Basics: Dieticians, biochemists and other experts also dismissed the caveman diet, said to be favoured by actor Matthew McConaughey (pictured), which says we should eat berries, vegetables and lean meat . However, biochemist Madeline Burke said: ‘There is no evidence linking hormone synchronisation and weight loss.’ Meal-replacement drinks were also found . wanting. Rob Hagan, a biomolecular scientist, said we need variety, not . least to avoid ‘losing your enjoyment of food’ and becoming depressed. 'Cutting all sugar from your diet would be very difficult to achieve' Leah Fitzsimmons, biochemist . The bizarre clay diet was also considered a health risk. Its followers believe a spoon of clay a day detoxifies the body, boosts the immune system and balances acidity levels. However, dieticians warn it can cause problems from constipation to poisoning and say ‘detoxing’ is a marketing myth. Sense About Science, which has created an online quiz on the issue called Spoof Diets, says: ‘People actually introduce malnutrition through overly restrictive diets… and they lose heart following unsustainable diets.’ Catherine Collins, of the British Dietetic Association, said: ‘Fad diet promoters never let sound nutrition get in the way of persuasive marketing to promote their myths and generate profit.’","UN has warned sugar could be 'new tobacco' because of risks to health .

"It was part Little Bo Peep, part pantomime dame and shinier than a fresh conker. The Duchess of Cambridge opted for a new hairstyle as she met schoolchildren yesterday – and it rather stole the limelight. Instead of her usual relaxed waves, Kate’s glossy mane was pinned in a half-up, half-down style, back-combed on top, and teased into tight ringlets …to begin with, at least. Scroll down for video . Straight from the stylist's chair: The Duchess of Cambridge's curls were in tact as she arrived for her visit to the Blessed Sacrament School in Islington, north London yesterday. She wore a £450 coral dress from Goat . Ringing the changes: Kate's tight ringlets (left) quickly dropped away in the heat (right). She was at the north London school to find out about the progress of a charity progress she launched last year . But it seems that even being a member of the royal family doesn’t make you immune to the perils of hot weather. Not long into the visit to the Blessed Sacrament School in Islington, north London, the heat and humidity caused Kate’s curls to drop rather dramatically. The 32-year-old was left with rather limp locks – still pinned somewhat severely off her forehead. Kate was at the school to find out about the progress of charity project she launched last year. M-PACT Plus provides early support for children affected by a parent’s drug or alcohol misuse. The Duchess wore a £450 coral pink dress from Goat as she chatted to youngsters in the sunshine – but it was her hairstyle, which could have been a wig from pre-revolutionary, peri-wigged France, that came in for the most scrutiny. The colour of her hair also attracted attention, for it appeared to have been lightened, and some strands looked almost blonde. Doing the twist: The Duchess' 'do from the back. Yesterday's curled style was a more theatrical look than the her usual glossy blow-dry, but was thought to have been the work of her regular stylist, Amanda Cook Tucker . Celebrity hairdresser Andrew Barton believes this had been done using a gentle tint, rather than conventional bleach highlights, to avoid Kate ending up with unsightly roots. He said: ‘Subtle lightening like this is achieved with a low peroxide formula. ‘The hair is only lightened towards the mid-length and ends, not at the roots, which would prevent root regrowth.’ Kate used to be a regular at the Richard Ward salon in Chelsea, but is now thought to go to Mayfair-based Italian stylist Rossano Ferretti, who charges £1,000 for a haircut. Princess in pink: Kate's hair was pinned back to make sure that it did not fall in her face as she spent time talking to her young flag-wearing fans outside the school. Her style is also suitably formal for an official visit . Yesterday’s curled style was a more theatrical look than the Duchess’s usual glossy blow-dry, but was thought to have been the work of her regular stylist, Amanda Cook Tucker. She is believed to have achieved the style by blow-drying Kate’s hair and then using large curling tongs to create those ringlets. The top section of the hair appears to have been back-combed, and then pinned back. Tightly curled hair like this will naturally drop over time, as the effects of hairspray wear off and gravity kicks in – and as Kate discovered, this happens more quickly in warm  or windy weather. While Kate’s curls were enviably glossy, the tightly pinned-back style also managed to make her usually lustrous locks look thinner. Unfurled curls: Kate's hair looks more lackluster as she leaves her visit with a framed painting under her arm. The piece of art - a portrait of her holding Prince George - was given to her by a young girl as she left . Online comments about the Duchess’s new style were mixed. Some declared the hairdo was ‘pretty’ and ‘elegant’, while others criticised the look, posting ‘What’s going with the hair? That’s the worst I’ve seen her look’ and ‘I had hair like that when I was five’. Celebrity hairdresser Stephanie Pollard said: ‘I think she might have been aiming for a Jackie Onassis, a 1960s look to go with the dress."" Of course Jackie Onassis’s hair was always much shorter than Kate’s and therefore her Sixties hair was never in danger of tipping into this odd hybrid of little girl ringlets and “grande dame”. Still, while it may not be to everybody’s taste, the look is rather regal, echoing those swept-back styles of Princess Michael of Kent and Princess Anne. It is also suitably formal for an official visit, though a little ageing on a younger woman. Favourite style: Kate opted for a similar curly style - but without the pinned back mid-section - when she attended a ceremony in Quebec during her and William's Royal tour of Canada in 2011 . One society stylist who did not want to be named said of Kate’s style: ‘She seems too old for the ringlets and too young for the severity on the top. What a strange “do”.’ Of course, this isn’t the first time the Duchess has displayed a penchant for curls. There were ringlets poking out from under a stetson at the Calgary stampede in 2011 on her royal tour of Canada, a ‘yee-ha’ look that should have been completed with a piece of straw in her mouth and a bit of thigh-slapping. She also sported ringlets at last year’s Remembrance Sunday parade, and was criticised because her habit of constantly twirling them looked like a display of vanity on a sombre occasion. However, Barton points out how hard it is to dress hair for royal events. He said: ‘Kate does suffer from time to time with ensuring her hair looks formal enough while looking young for certain occasions.’ In other words, it’s impossible to have formal hair that looks young, because young hair is messy hair, and that’s not very royal. Denise McAdam, who was hairdresser to the royal family for 35 years, has said that the Duchess’s hair is ‘wonderful, maybe a little overdone at times’. Looks like yesterday was one of those times.","Kate's glossy mane was pinned in a half-up, half-down style with ringlets .

"Doctors are investigating whether statins cause side-effects or not . A leading medical journal overstated the dangers of  taking statins by up to 20 times, it was claimed last night. The British Medical Journal has  now withdrawn statements published last year that said the cholesterol-lowering drugs cause side effects in one in five patients, but has not retracted the articles. A leading statins researcher, who says the figure is one in 100, called the claims a ‘huge error’ that will ‘cause unnecessary deaths’. It is feared the BMJ articles could discourage patients from taking the life-saving medicines, which are prescribed to millions in the UK. The journal yesterday blamed internal and external reviewers for failing to pick up the mistakes and pledged an independent investigation to determine whether the articles should be retracted completely. Professor Sir Rory Collins said the BMJ articles overstated the risks of taking statins by 20 times. Sir Rory, who has led analysis of many statin trials, said side effects affect less than 1 per cent of patients – compared to the 18 to 20 per cent figure quoted by  the BMJ. And the professor, whose work at the Clinical Trials Research Unit in Oxford has been sponsored by drugs companies as well as academic bodies and charities, called for the BMJ to issue a full apology and retraction of the articles. Sir Rory said: ‘The authors of these two papers misrepresented the evidence repeatedly, even after their errors had been pointed out to them. ‘Such misconduct should be dealt with appropriately by retracting these seriously flawed papers in the interest of public health. 'If people at elevated risk stop taking their statins – or don’t start taking their statins – they will have unnecessary heart attacks and strokes. There will be unnecessary deaths from vascular causes. This is a serious disservice to medicine.’ About eight  million in the UK at risk of heart disease are prescribed statins, many of whom will be confused by conflicting claims about side effects in recent months. In October, a BMJ article by John Abramson and colleagues questioned the decision to extend statins to thousands at low risk of heart attacks and strokes, saying the drugs had not been proven to save lives in that group. Side effects of statins are said to include muscle pain and memory problems - but academics disagree in their findings . They said an observational study had shown that between 18 per cent and 20 per cent of statin users suffer side effects such as liver disease and kidney problems and this figure was repeated in a BMJ commentary by a cardiologist. The UK is the top prescriber of statins in Europe, and second only to Australia in the developed world. More than a million prescriptions for the cholesterol-busting drugs are written each week in England, compared with a few thousand in 1981. Doctors used to prescribe statins only to patients with a 30 per cent risk of a heart attack within the next decade, but this was cut to a 20 per cent risk in 2005. Under guidance being proposed, the threshold would be lowered to 10 per cent. Oxford University researchers looking at 27 statin trials involving 175,000 people, some of whom were at low risk of heart problems, found the drugs cut the risk of heart attacks, strokes and operations to unblock arteries by a third or more. The benefits were gained no matter what level of cholesterol patients started out with. Healthier people who were given statins also had lower overall death rates than those given a placebo. It concluded the positives greatly exceeded any side effects from taking the drugs. The most serious reaction is myopathy in about one in 1,000 users, resulting in muscle pain, tenderness and weakness. This condition can progress to rhabdomyolysis – a breakdown of muscle cells that can lead to kidney failure and death. Both authors have now withdrawn that statement. The journal’s editor-in-chief Dr Fiona Godlee said she was withdrawing some of the statements made in the articles. This was ‘so that patients who could benefit from statins are not wrongly deterred from starting or continuing treatment because of exaggerated concerns over side effects’. The decision on whether to retract the entire article – and all of the claims made in it – has been passed to an independent panel, she added. Medical experts have long debated whether the use of statins should be extended to people with a low risk of heart disease. Professor Peter Weissberg, medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said it welcomed the BMJ’s move. He said: ‘Statins are an important weapon in the fight against heart disease and it is essential that trusted medical journals like the BMJ do not mislead the public. ‘Patients should feel reassured by this move and should not stop taking their statin.’ But Professor Kevin Channer, consultant cardiologist at Claremont Hospital, Sheffield, this month told the Daily Mail he would not take a statin unless absolutely necessary, . ‘Whenever you’re taking a drug, you’ve got to think about the risks and the benefits,’ he said. ‘Statins reduce your chance of heart attack or stroke by about 30 per cent, so, yes, there’s a benefit. But in real terms, it’s very small. ‘My annual risk of a stroke or heart attack is about 1 per cent – very low. Taking a statin would take it down to 0.7 per cent – still very low.  I’ve spent my professional life prescribing statins, so I know about the side effects: muscle aches, debility and stomach upsets.’","Have long been fears about statins cause harmful side effects .

"The guide is the first published by Cosmopolitan since it became a women's magazine in the 1960s . Known as the high-street sex bible, women’s magazine Cosmopolitan has once again pushed boundaries when it comes to bedroom advice. The magazine has published its very first sex guide for lesbian couples in its 50 year history. In keeping with other erotic material published by the magazine, the piece entitled ’28 mind-blowing lesbian sex positions’ has graphic descriptions for each one. Containing step-by-step information on exotic sounding positions such as the ‘kinky jockey’, the ‘tawdry tire-swing’, the ‘erotic maypole’ and the ‘sexy spider’, the guide also has accompanying explicit drawings for each. Requiring a variety of props, including sex toys, handcuffs, chairs the guide includes role playing (think, good cop bad cop type scenarios) as well as mild S&M. While not for the prudish or faint-of-heart, the guide marks an increasing inclusion of homosexual relationships in mainstream media. Cosmopolitan.com has over 1.6 million readers worldwide, making it the largest young women’s magazine worldwide. Originally started as a family magazine in America in 1886, it only took its current form as a women’s magazine in the 1960s, becoming increasingly more sexual in content. The piece features information on exotic sounding positions such as the 'kinky jockey', the 'tawdry tire-swing', the 'erotic maypole' and the 'sexy spider' Now a champion of sexual liberation for women, with the idea that women should enjoy sex without any guilt placed on them by societal prejudices, the magazine runs articles on numerous ways women can maximise their pleasure in bed as well as please their man. Former editor of The Erotic Review and Daily Mail sex columnist Rowan Pelling says: 'There's no greater mirror of contemporary sexual mores than Cosmopolitan. When erotic fashions evolve, Cosmo reflects those changes, so there's no doubt the mag's publication of a lesbian sex guide is significant. 'It demonstrates far greater acceptance of same sex relationships and of experimentation by women who feel their sexuality is fluid. And it must come as a huge relief to all the Cosmo writers who have exhausted every single thing you can possibly say about blow-jobs and the reverse cowboy.' Good cop, naughty cop: This position is essentially the same as 'doggy style', but involving either the use of a strap-on sex toy, or manual stimulation while the lower partner has their hands handcuffed behind their back. The passionate pole dancer: One partner sits on a chair, with the other partner supported in their lap, facing away from them. Raising a knee helps keep things stable as well as providing stimulation for their clitoris. The Kinky Jockey: One partner kneels on all four and the other sits on them, using their tailbone as clitoral stimulation while yanking their hair like reins. Defying gravity: One partner sits normal in a chair while the other kneels on her, facing out, and drops down to the floor, using their hands to balance. This provides an ideal position for oral sex.","Guide features 28 positions for female lovers .

"In a humiliating admission, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said today that there was an explicit link between the al Qaeda network in North Africa and the deadly attacks on the U.S. consulate in Libya, backtracking from what the State Department had said previously. Speaking at a Security Council meeting at the United Nations, Mrs Clinton said an Algerian-founded branch of the al Qaeda network was situated in the area, using their location to plan and execute attacks, like the one in Benghazi on September 11. This goes directly against the initial statements of the White House and President Obama, who acknowledged that the consulate attack, which killed Libyan ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans, was a terrorist attack but that al Qaeda’s involvement's was unclear. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Response: Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has promised a full and open inquiry into the attack, which occurred on the 11th anniversary of 9/11 . Mrs Clinton, pictured earlier attending a UN Security Council meeting on peace and security in the Middle East during the general assembly . The secretary of state did not cite any new information to make these claims, the New York Times reported. Meanwhile, the White House told reporters today that President Obama now believes the assault on the embassy was the work of a terrorist attack. ‘It is our view as an administration, the president’s view, that it was a terrorist attack,’ press secretary Jay Carney said, according to ABC News. The administration had initially hinted that the violent and fiery attacks were fuelled by rage from an anti-Islam film. Mr Carney said that ‘there was no reason (the president) chose the words he did beyond trying to provide a full explanation of his views and his assessment that we need to await further information that the investigation will uncover.’ This comes as Libyan president Mohamed Magarief . claimed the deadly 9/11 anniversary attack on the U.S. Consulate in . Benghazi was undoubtedly a 'pre-planned act of terrorism.' The . comments follow repetitive claims by the U.S. government that the . attack last month that killed ambassador Chris Stevens was spontaneous, . and was sparked by an anti-Islam film produced in California. The White House said that President Obama, pictured today at Kent State University in Ohio, has now acknowledged the deadly attacks to be the work of terrorists . But . President Magarief quashed the idea the assault on the consulate was . prompted by the movie, adding that he has 'no doubt' it was a . premeditated act of terrorism targeting American citizens. 'It's a pre-planned act of terrorism,' he told NBC's Ann Curry, adding that the anti-Islam film had 'nothing to do with this attack.' The Libyan president's remarks also come as a report in The Daily Beast claims U.S. intelligence agencies knew within 24 hours that the fire fight at the Benghazi consulate building was orchestrated by al Qaeda-affiliates hiding in Eastern Libya. Unnamed officials said they had even tracked down the location of one suspect within this time, using social media. In the interview with NBC, Magarief said the fact the attack occurred on September 11 was hugely significant, and provided further evidence that it was orchestrated by extremists rather than spontaneous protesters. Terrorism: Libyan President Mohamed Magarief, speaking to NBC, said he had 'no doubt' the attack on the U.S. Consulate was pre-planned . Significant: Magarief, pictured right with Ann Curry, said the fact the attack occurred on September 11 was of great significance . He added that there were no protesters . at the consulate before the assault, which he told the TV station came . in two waves - the first involving rocket-propelled grenades on the . consulate then with mortars at a safe house. 'Reaction . (to the anti-Islam film) should have been six months . earlier. So it was postponed until the 11th of September. They chose this date to carry a certain message.' -Libyan president Mohamed Magarief . The U.S. government initially denied that the attacks were planned, instead linking them directly to protests over the film. It wasn't until late last week that the Obama administration formally acknowledged the deadly 9/11 assault was in fact a terrorist attack. Magarief said the video had been available for months before the Benghazi attack and therefore wasn't the catalyst. 'Reaction . should have been, if it was genuine, should have been six months . earlier. So it was postponed until the 11th of September,' he told NBC. 'They chose this date, 11th of September to carry a certain message.' When asked by Curry what his evidence . was that the attack was pre-planned, he said: 'Number one, is choosing . the date, 11th of September has all the significance. If we take the . facts about the way it was executed we can see there is enough proof . that it is a pre-planned act of terrorism.' Four U.S. citizens died in the attack on the consulate in Benghazi, including the U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens, as well as former Navy SEALs . Assault: The U.S. Consulate in Benghazi was burned during a protest by an armed group on the eleventh anniversary of the September 11 attacks . He said it was too early for him to give the minute details of the attack but he said the perpetrators must have had experience. 'It . was launched with a high degree of accuracy which means the . perpetrators must have some kind of exercise on how to hit and how to . launch these acts,' he said. Magarief said he thinks that al Qaeda . was behind the assault but he added there was so far no direct evidence . to prove that is the case. 'As the investigation progresses that is the likelihood we will reach that,' he said. According to The Daily Beast, U.S. intelligence agencies knew within 24 hours that al Qaeda-affiliated operatives were behind the deadly assault. Three separate unnamed officials told the website that early information was enough to show the attack was planned and orchestrated by groups in Eastern Libya linked to al Qaeda. They said U.S. intelligence agencies . developed leads on four of the participants within 24 hours of the fire . fight that killed Stevens as well as information management officer Sean . Smith and security personnel Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty. Destruction: A man walks in the rubble of the consulate after the attack that claimed four Americans . For one of the suspects, the U.S. agencies were able to track his location using social media within that time. 'We had two kinds of intelligence on one guy,' the official told The Daily Beast. 'We believe we had enough to target him.' Another U.S. intelligence official told the website: 'There was very good information on this in the first 24 hours. These guys have a return address. There are camps of people and a wide variety of things we could do.' A third U.S. intelligence official said he could not get into specific numbers 'but soon after the attack we had a pretty good bead on some individuals involved.' The sources didn't reveal whether the agencies had targeted or arrested any of the suspected assailants, stressing that the complex investigation was continuing.

"These alarming pictures show 18,000 freshly sliced shark fins drying on the roof of an industrial building in Hong Kong. Traders have taken to airing the fins on rooftops after a backlash against the old practice of scattering them on pavements. The meat is used to make a soup that is a popular delicacy served as a status symbol by the wealthy across Asia. Disgusted: Conservationist Sharon Kwok, director of NGO's Aquameridian & Mission Blue, stands on a roof covered in fins holding a photo of a mutilated shark . Out of sight: Traders have begun airing the fins on the of this industrial building following a public outcry over them being scattered on pavements . Cruel industry: Workers arrange the fins after they were hacked off live animal and transported to the Chinese city . Hunters hack the fins off live animals and then toss the creatures back into the ocean to drown. Many of China's richest citizens believe the soup has medicinal benefits and serve it at celebrations. Each fin can fetch up to £380 ($600) a pound, with a single bowl of the prized soup fetching up to £108. But the business is causing the death of up to 100million sharks every year. The fins were shipped from an unknown location and unloaded at a nearby pier to be dried on the rooftop. While sales have declined in Hong Kong in recent years, activists want to see a total ban in the city, labelled by some the shark fin capital of the world. Anger: Activists demand a total shark fin ban in the city, labelled by some as the shark fin capital of the world . Concerns: Sales of the gourmet soup - which can fetch up to £108 per bowl - have fallen in recent years because of its controversial nature . Delicacy: The fins are made into an expensive broth, which is served by wealthy households at dinner parties across Asia . The global population of sharks, who . are slow-growing and slow to reproduce, has declined significantly since . commercial fishing began. Finning . takes place off every the coast of every continent, particularly in . poorer countries that do not have the resources to monitor and prosecute . shark hunters. Countries with anti shark finning laws . include the US, Canada, Brazil, Namibia, South Africa and the European . Union, while Hawaii recently outlawed the sale of the soup. Numerous celebrities have made a stand against finning. Last year, Gordon Ramsey called the shark trade ‘cruel’, ‘sick’, ‘tragic’, ‘barbaric’, ‘wasteful’ and ‘out of control’. Efficient: The fins were shipped from an unknown location and unloaded at a nearby pier to be dried on the roof . The celebrity chef’s Channel 4 documentary, Shark Bait followed the sharks dying in horrific circumstances - ‘surgically ­separated’ from their fins with a machete, before being tossed back into the ocean, as the meat on the body is far less valuable. But two weeks later the chef was accused of being a hypocrite, as footage emerged that appeared to show a bronzed Ramsey reeling in a seven-foot bull shark. U.S. actress Bo Derek wants to ban the selling, trading or possessing of fins and said finning has created a global environmental crisis in which shark stocks could be wiped out in one generation. Actress January Jones was recently awarded for her commitment to sharks by Oceana, and NBA star Yao Ming, the 7ft 6in Chinese mega-celebrity, swore off the expensive delicacy back in 2006.","Hunters hack the fins off live animals and toss them back into the sea .

"True or false? Andrea Rossi, pictured, says he has built a machine achieving 'cold fusion'  but scientists question if it is possible . An Italian physicist claims he has managed to achieve 'cold fusion' - a procedure that could solve the world's energy crisis by creating huge amounts of safe nuclear energy without dangerous radiation. Andrea Rossi says his new machine fuses nickel and hydrogen at room temperature creating almost unlimited energy. But there is one problem - many scientists claim it defies the very laws of physics. Several high-profile demonstrations of 'cold fusion' have been proven to be hoaxes in the past - and no one can adequately explain how or why it might work. The United States Department of Energy the U.S. Patent Office say the process is impossible because physics rules out the possibility of room-temperature nuclear fusion. But Rossi's E-Cat machine can allegedly do it, and he says he proved it worked during tests at the University of Bologna last month. 'With low energy, it's possible to give a heater a certain amount of energy and to get from the same heater a superior amount of energy,' he said. 'The heat is initiated by electrical resistance. The reactors then produce another 479kWh of energy for another three to four hours without needing that initial electrical input -- the low-level nuclear reaction continues on its own. Machine: Professor Rossi's E-Cat was tested last month and produced huge amounts of non-radioactive energy, he says . Key: Rossi says he has produced a pattern of triple track atoms, pictured, which is at the heart of the cold fusion theory . 'The test we made by the customer was to see if the process was working properly, and to control whether the energy was in an amount superior to the amount supplied to the system. 'We have nothing to say, just to make plans that work properly and let those facts win against the scepticism.' The idea of cold fusion was put forward by in the 1920s by Austrian scientists Friedrich Paneth and Kurt Peters. But despite several people saying they have done it, it has been dismissed by most physicists. An atom is a nucleus of protons and neutrons, with electrons orbiting around . Scientists say that Rossi's claims must be taken from his lab and analysed before he can claim he has done it. Energy consultant Jonathan Koomey said '[The E-Cat experiment] should be treated as a hoax until independent scientists are able to replicate these results,' But Sterling Allan, CEO of the alternative energy news agency Pure Energy Systems, told FoxNews.com he attended Rossi’s demonstration and the E-Cat is self sustaining. 'What Rossi demonstrated was 470 kilowatts of continuous output in self-sustain mode -- meaning the output was enough to keep the thing running on its own,' he said.","Andrea Rossi says he can fuse nickel and hydrogen at room temperature creating almost unlimited energy .

"Former first daughter Chelsea Clinton has signed on to help promote President Obama's inaugural kick-off event to get Americans engaged in serving their communities. The 32-year-old plans to headline a summit on the National Mall on Saturday that is the centerpiece of the president's National Day of Service, a call to action meant to honor the legacy of Dr Martin Luther King Jr. on the holiday weekend celebrating his birthday. Acting as the day's honorary chair is a new inaugural role for the woman who participated in the festivities as an adolescent, standing next to her father, Bill Clinton, as he was sworn into office in 1993 and 1997. Getting involved: Chelsea Clinton, pictured with her mother behind President Obama in 2008, is the honorary chair of the president's inaugural Day of Service event . Getting political: Rumors have been swirling about Chelsea getting into the family business of politics . Clinton was often seen but not heard as a youth growing up in the White House, but increasingly has made her public voice heard in recent years. She campaigned for her mom, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's, 2008 presidential primary campaign against Obama and now is an NBC News special correspondent. Last fall she traveled to Nigeria on behalf of her father's charitable foundation, meeting with the country's president and promoting the Clinton Health Access Initiative's efforts to reduce child mortality there. A week after Election Day, she appeared at the Glamour Women of the Year awards in New York with a stage full of women who had been involved in races across the country, noting that gender progress was made in 2012 although there still is a long way to go. First daughter: Chelsea is pictured aged 11 in January 1992 before her father won the presidential election . First family: Chelsea shares a laugh with her parents . She has promoted efforts to allow gay marriage and assisted in raising money for victims of Hurricane Sandy. 'When I was growing up, both my parents and grandparents instilled a commitment to service in me,' Clinton said in a statement provided to The Associated Press by the Presidential Inaugural Committee. 'They taught me that helping our neighbors and serving our community were essential parts of being a good citizen and a good person.' Inauguration planners are asking people across the country to sign up for the effort and have staff in all 50 states to coordinate activities across the nation. Obama, a one-time community organizer, began the tradition four years ago, expanded it this time and hopes to make it an inaugural tradition, planners say. Charity work: Last fall, Chelsea traveled to Nigeria on behalf of her father's charitable foundation, meeting with the country's president and promoting the Clinton Health Access Initiative's efforts to reduce child mortality there . The fair that Clinton will be headlining will feature service opportunities in seven areas - community resilience, economic development, education, environment, faith, health and veterans and military families. Clinton said in her statement that Saturday is just the beginning - Obama is asking people to pledge to keep volunteering regularly help their neighbors in the long term. 'Think about how much good we can all do if everyone who pitches in this weekend keeps up that commitment throughout the year,' she said. She added that she'll be thinking of her late grandmothers when she takes part because they always found time to volunteer for their churches, communities and kids' schools no matter what else was going on in their lives. Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and members of their families plan to take part in service events Saturday in the Washington area.

"Southampton boss Ronald Koeman has criticised England's 'crazy' Christmas schedule, claiming the traditional fixture pile-up only favours the biggest clubs. The Saints, who are second in the Barclays Premier League, face Aston Villa on Monday ahead of a testing month that brings games against Manchester City, Arsenal, Manchester United, Everton and Chelsea. Koeman's side also have to play four games in nine days over Christmas including league fixtures on Boxing Day and New Year's Day before the FA Cup third round on the first weekend in January. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Premier League preview: Aston Villa vs Southampton . Southampton boss Ronald Koeman called the Christmas fixture schedule 'impossible' and 'crazy' Southampton players celebrate with Shane Long after scoring against Leicester in a 2-0 win . 'It's difficult because I don't have experience playing that number of games in such a short time,' Koeman said. 'I always used to be on holiday during Christmas and now we have a lot of games to prepare for. 'I told the players, ""honestly, I don't have that experience"", it's difficult. 'We have to play December 26 and then again on the 28th, January 1 and then January 3 for the FA Cup - it's crazy. 'It's not crazy to play at Christmas because I understand - we had that in Holland and the people like that. 'I'd like that as well if I like football and support Southampton - I can have my Christmas meal then go to the stadium and watch Southampton, I am happy. Southampton have only started 15 different players in the Premier League this season . Koeman took over from Mauricio Pochettino in the summer and Southampton have been a revelation . 'The problem is you have one day off between two games and that's crazy, that's impossible. 'That's my problem with the schedule because if it's the 26th and the 29th, no problem, but it's Friday and Sunday. That's crazy, one day off, crazy.' Southampton have reaped the benefits of Koeman's consistent selection policy this season. The Saints have started less players (15) in the league so far than top four rivals Arsenal (18), Tottenham (21), Liverpool (21) and Manchester United (22). Koeman believes the fixture congestion at Christmas plays into the hands of those teams with bigger squads at their disposal. 'Does it favour the big clubs? Yes. They can change players much easier than other teams in the Premier League,' Koeman said. 'It is worst for the clubs who haven't got 24 players at the same level. Koeman believes the smaller squads are at a disadvantage over a hectic festive period . 'You have to change your team and I don't like to change my team. I believe if the team is doing well you can change one or two positions but I don't believe in changing my team in six or seven positions.' If Southampton want to keep pace with the sides at the top of the table, they may need to bolster their options in the January transfer window. 'Our transfer policy in January doesn't depend on winning and losing over the next month,' Koeman said. 'It depends on the players we have - for example we know that Sadio Mane has to play at the African Nations Cup, Maya Yoshida will play in the Asian Cup but we don't need a lot of players. 'I am happy with the players we have. It depends on injuries if you need someone but it's too early to make conclusions about that.'","Ronald Koeman labels festive fixture pile-up 'crazy'

"A devoted grandmother lost an incredible nine stone after doctors told her she would not live to see the children grow up. Janice Lomas, 64, who works as a nursing assistant for the NHS, was having problems breathing and struggling to walk. Weighing in at 17st 12lbs, Janice was forced to take time off work because of bad health in 2011, but when Janice went to the doctor she was told that she didn't have any medical problems besides being overweight. Janice Lomas lost 9 stone, dropping from nearly 18st (right) to 8st 5lbs (left) after her weight began to affect her health and doctors told her she might not live to see her grandchildren grow up . After drastically overhauling the ‘chip pan’ diet that she was brought up on and taking up walking, Janice’s weight has fallen to 8st 5lbs over the last two years. She said: ‘I had tests and was shocked when I was told it was my weight. ‘I have four grandchildren and they were aged between five and 10. I was told that I wouldn't live long enough to see them grow up.’ ‘If I was going to live to see them into adulthood and enjoy my life with them then I had to do something about it.’ Janice Lomas with her grandchildren Luke Lomas, Megan and Molly Hallwood, who were her inspiration for losing weight . She said: ‘I was brought up in Scotland out of a chip pan. Now I stop when I've had enough and I cook differently. Everything I buy is as low-fat as possible. I don't really eat sweet things any more.’ Previously unable to walk 500m without suffering backache, Janice now strolls two miles to her daughter's house in Walkden, Salford, every day and then two miles back to her home in Little Hulton. It's taken her 23 months to drop from a size 30 to a size 10 - she's has been to Slimming World in Little Hulton every week since 2011. Janice has now reached her target weight of 8.5 stone and is a committee member at the club, helping others to lose weight. Janice has been named Manchester's slimmer of the year and on October 4 she will compete in the UK semi-finals in Derbyshire.","Janice Lomas, 64, weighed 17st 12lbs and had problems breathing .

"Sticky situation: Bradley Herbert Hardison has been charged with breaking and entering, but a day earlier, we won first prize at a doughnut eating competition . There's no way to sugar coat this story! A North Carolina man who won first prize in an eating competition against some police officers, found himself with a glazed look of his own when they arrested him a day after his victorious binge. The Camden County Sheriff's Office had been looking for 24-year-old Bradley Herbert Hardison of Elizabeth City in connection with two break-ins. For nearly nine months, he was a man on the run. Authorities finally caught up with Hardison and arrested him on Wednesday, just hours after he won the adult division of a doughnut-eating contest at the Elizabeth City Police Department's National Night Out Against Crime. The event, as the event suggests, was packed with police. Hardison ate eight doughnuts in two minutes, beating a group that included local police officers and firefighters. The day after the police-sponsored event, his triumph went stale. Hardison’s win caught the attention of a local newspaper, along with the attention of Lt. Robeson and less than 24 hours after swallowing his last crumb, The Camden County Sheriff's Office caught up with him after months of investigation and arrested him. Victory went stale: Hardison devoured eight glazed doughnuts in two . minutes at the eating competition, but he was a arrested just a day . later. Enjoying the moment: 24-year-old Bradley Herbert Hardison's swwet taste of victory was short lived because he was arrested less than 24-hours later after police realized he was a wanted felon . Hardison was jailed under a $2,000 secured bond on two counts of felony breaking and entering and misdemeanor injury to real property. 'I . did congratulate him,' says Lt. Max Robeson, a deputy with the Camden . County Sheriff’s Office. 'Good for him. He can eat a lot of doughnuts. Good for him.' 'When . I came in that morning and read that article I was pissed because it’s . like throwing it in our face,' he says. 'We’ve been looking for you for . months. I didn’t ask him if he won a trophy – he probably did.' In November, investigators say Hardison broke into several grocery stores and he is accused of stealing $5,000 in cash.

"A food nut has lost six stone by beating her addiction to peanut butter - at the height of her dependence, she was getting through an incredible 2lbs of it every week. Each week 19st Dee McKenna, 48, of Bovingdon, Hertforshire, finished a giant jar of her favourite extra-crunchy Skippy peanut butter packed with 6,000 calories - equal to 12 Big Macs.

People used to think I was nuts. 'I knew it was very high in calories but that's why it was so satisfying to eat.

"Did you have sex on the weekend? Did you at least think about it? Or has sex moved from something that was on the agenda (if not achieved), to an activity that's not even considered any more? According to a study by The Times sex columnnist Suzy Godson of married couples aged 36-55, 44 per cent had sex weekly, 32 had sex monthly, 11 per cent had sex annually, 9 per cent never have sex and 4 per cent had sex every day. Scroll down for video . Almost ten per cent of married couples aged between 36-55 never have sex . Lack of interest in sex was one of the most common reasons given for couples not having it regularly. 'Doesn't every married couple stop having sex once they're been together ages?' a friend asked me once. The answer is a lot do. A lot of couples get divorced as well – and like it or not, there's a definite link. If a couple are having good, regular sex, it accounts for around 20% of total relationship satisfaction. If the couple stop having sex or sex isn't enjoyable, it's relationship cryptonite and poisons everything – even if you both agree to take it off the table. If you're pushing 90 and need a Zimmerframe to move around in bed, I can understand why you might give up on sex. I also acknowledge there are couples out there where both partners have zero or extremely low libidos and seriously aren't bothered by a future which doesn't include any sex. But how many couples truly do fall into this category? Tracey believes that a lack of sex correlates with divorce . The thing is, the chances of finding and hooking up with someone who has exactly the same sex drive as you – high, low or middling - is extremely rare. Even couples who pride themselves on having evenly matched desire levels can point to discrepancies when pushed: one inevitably fancying it more than the other in certain situations. Which means, in my opinion, pretty much everyone who stops having sex is risking their relationship. Here's why. We get more from sex than we think. Not only does it keep us physically satisfied, it provides much-needed excitement and stimulation in our lives. Sex makes us feel wanted and attractive, needed and admired. We feel emotionally connected to the person we're having sex with: touching and orgasm releases endorphins (feel good chemicals) which create a feeling of well being. Satisfying sex also boosts our immune system and promotes production of a substance called oxytocin, making us feel warm and snuggly. Because it makes our blood pump furiously, sex is good for the heart in a physical sense, but also in an emotional capacity. Humans are driven to seek pleasure and sex encourages our body to release the pleasure substance, PEA (phenylethylamine), making us feel light-headed and light-hearted. Sex reduces stress and frustration levels, makes our skin glow, our hair shine and our eyes sparkle. And you want to give all this up? Are you serious? Even if you don't want to reconsider given all this information, your partner may well do. Here's another thing: it's easy to forget how good sex is and how all of the above feels, when you're not getting any. But there will come a time when you're reminded of how good it was. You're away on a business trip, working late and eating in the hotel restaurant, and the friendly, attractive waiter leans forward to clear your food away and you get a whiff of his aftershave and out of nowhere, suddenly you remember and all those memories of hot, frantic, fabulous sex rush back at alarming speed. Even sexed-up couples feel the pull of 'Why not?' in situations like this. How are you (or your partner) going to cope when you haven't had sex for months or years (even if voluntarily) and you know having your appetite reawakened means nothing because the bored-with-sex partner at home, hasn't had the same experience. Yes, you could try racing home and saying 'Honey, I remember how great sex was! Let's do it up against the wall like we used to!'. But if you honestly think that'll be greeted with a yawn, disapproving frown and 'I thought we discussed we weren't doing that anymore' sniff, next time you might well opt to chat up the dishy waiter. Or work colleague. Or that guy on the bus who you've started chatting to lately, feeling an oddly familiar stirring below as you do so. No matter how much your partner loves you, no matter how much they or you believe they're immune to temptation, they're not. And you're not. Stop having sex with each other and you risk both of you wanting to have sex with someone else. It's that simple. So if your excuse for not 'doing it' is simply that neither of you feel like it anymore because you've been together 'forever' and it seems like 'such an effort' and you'd both 'really honestly watch telly together', perhaps you might like to have a little rethink.

"Richard Engel, the chief foreign news correspondent for NBC News, revealed the psychological torture he and his crew endured in captivity after they were abducted at the Syrian border last week. Speaking with the TODAY show’s Savannah Guthrie, Engel and his crew said that each of them thought every one of the five days they spent in captivity would be their last. They also spoke of the horrors put on them by their captors, saying that they were routinely blindfolded, handcuffed, and lined up execution style to the sounds of guns being loaded. Engel said it was a tactic. ‘They don’t want you to be strong,’ he said. ‘They would blindfold you. They line you up against the wall, you hear weapons loading and unloading, you hear plastic wrap. Then they leave you there for 30 minutes. And that was happening every day.’ Scroll down for video . Relaying horrors: Speaking Thursday night on 'Rock Center with Brian Williams,' Richard Engel recounted the horrors of his five days in Syrian captivity . Captive: NBC chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel, center, with NBC Turkey reporter Aziz Akyavas, left, and NBC photographer John Kooistra, right, after they were taken hostage in Syria . Engel and his crew, including producers Ghazi Balkiz and Aziz Akyavas, as well as cameraman John Kooistra were seasoned in covert reporting in the war-ravaged country, but were taken hostage in Syria earlier this month by an unknown group. NBC News reported that they received no calls demanding ransoms for the crew. Engel said that the reporting embargo in place in America was likely what kept them safe and alive. ‘Everyone at NBC did everything to keep it quiet, it was very important to us,’ he explained on 'Rock Center.' ‘The kidnappers didn’t know very much about us – the less they knew, the safer we were.’ None of the crew was hurt when they were abducted, though they killed one of the rebels who had been travelling with the NBC News crew, the New York Times reported. No single group has taken responsibility for the abduction. The crew was believed to have been taken near Ma-arrat Misrin, and were pictured in captivity with Arabic sprayed on the wall which read: ‘Or will burn.’ Glad to be back: The 'TODAY' show's Savannah Guthrie, left, spoke with Engel and his crew days after their return to the states . Free: NBC correspondent Richard Engel, center, and two of his crew members speak out after their release from Syrian captors. They were held for five days and released on Monday . Safe: Engel and his crew exit a car after crossing back into Turkey on Tuesday morning . Welcome: Engel, pictured as he is welcomed into the country, said he would 'rather forget' the ordeal . Engel said that he and his crew were kept apart from one another and were often blindfolded. ‘There is a tactic involved,’ he told Guthrie. ‘They knew that they were doing. 'They knew how to play nice and play evil within minutes of each other.’ 'You try to push the bad thoughts away. You know you have to stay strong.' As an example, the 39-year-old correspondent said that one minute, their captors were giving them tea, and the next, they were demanding the crew decide who would be killed first. But, they said, it was clear that their captors never intended to kill them. ‘They clearly wanted us as hostages, (and) they were violent.’ He said that he kept himself positive by thinking of a meal he would have when he was released, visualizing every step from setting the table to washing the dishes. 'You try to push bad thoughts away. You know you have to stay strong,' he said. At work: The chief foreign correspondent has lived in the Middle East for more than 15 years . Prominent: Engel, 39, is pictured at the end of a reporting trip in Syria in July 2012 . 'Then you’re having a second conversation where I say – I need to escape.' When Engel’s last report aired from Aleppo, he was already in captivity, where he would remain for the next five days. He and his crew had to cross into Turkey so as to broadcast from a safe location. They were freed as their captors passed a rebel checkpoint run by Syrian rebels on Monday, and then released to Turkey. Following his release, Engel told Turkish media that he would 'rather forget' the ordeal. He added to the Turkish news agency Anadolu that he and his team were 'very happy to be out' but 'very tired.' After his release, Akyavas told Turkish news station NTV that they had guns pointed on their heads ‘every now and then.’ ‘It was not pleasant,’ he added. Following the release of cameraman Ian Rivers, NBC News president Steve Capus released a statement saying that everyone at the company ‘can breathe a huge sigh of relief and express our deep appreciation to all who helped secure their freedom.’ He continued: ‘At the same time, our thoughts and concerns are with those who remain missing inside Syria and we hope for their swift and safe release.’ Engel, 39, offered his thanks on Twitter yesterday, writing: ‘Thank you for all the support, prayers and kind thoughts. We’re out. Free. Happy and safe.’ Speaking with the Today . show on Tuesday morning, the day after their release, the men recounted how they were led blindfolded . from room to room and had no idea what would happen to them.

'You . think that are going to take you outside to execute you,' Engel said. 'We weren't physically beaten or tortured. It was a lot of psychological . torture, threats of being killed. Safe: Engel said he stayed strong by picturing a meal he'd eat once freed and how he would prepare it . 'They . made us choose which one of us would be shot first and when we refused . there were mock shootings. They pretended to shoot Ghazi [Balkiz, an NBC . producer] several times.' Cameraman . John Kooistra, who was also captured, added: 'I made amends with my . maker. I made good with my maker. I made good with . myself. I was prepared to die many times.' But amid their fear, they worked together to stay positive, Engel said. 'We weren't allowed to speak but if . you peek underneath the blindfold, you can see if there's a guard in the . room,' he said. 'We tried to joke around a little. We passed messages . to each other.' Engel, . who is divorced and doesn't have children, was promoted to NBC News's . chief foreign correspondent in 2008.

"Hull KR gave Chris Chester a winning start to his reign as caretaker coach with a 40-10 demolition of Super League leaders St Helens. It was the perfect end to a turbulent week at the club, with the sacking of coach Craig Sandercock and players Wayne Ulugia and Jonny Walker. But Chester managed to lift the club's fortunes as hat-tricks from Omari Caro and Craig Hall and further tries from Graeme Horne and Greg Eden secured a well-deserved win over Nathan Brown's side, whose only replies came from Mark Percival and Mose Masoe. Gang up: Hull KR's Graeme Horne (left) and Omari Caro tackle St Helen's Tom Makinson . Standing strong: Hull KR's Travis Burns is tackled by St Helen's Luke Thompson (right) Caro, who has found himself playing for Championship One side Gateshead several times this season, opened the scoring in the sixth minute when he was in the right place at the right time to pounce on a loose ball, kick it forward and juggle it before sprinting clear to score. Travis Burns was off target with his conversion attempt but Rovers held a 4-0 lead. Saints, without a win at Rovers since 2007, drew level in the 10th minute when Percival capitalised on a defensive lapse on Rovers' right-hand side to score from 40 metres out before missing the touchline conversion. Rovers were dominating and made their territory and possession count further when they doubled their lead in the 25th minute. Burns was elusive in escaping the clutches of two Saints defenders to break clear and offload to the supporting Josh Hodgson, who spun a pass outside for Caro to score his second of the game and restore Rovers' four-point lead. Burns missed his second conversion of the game but was successful with his third in the 31st minute after Hall, who announced on Friday he would be joining Wakefield next season, scooped up a loose ball 45 metres out and sprinted home to score. A 14-4 cushion would have been a decent lead to take into half-time but Masoe's power drive through the KR defence was too much for the home side. Percival made no mistake from close to the posts to cut the deficit to 14-10 and Saints were happy to turn around just four points adrift given their lack of ball in Rovers' territory. Rare score: St Helen's Mark Percival scores his sides opening try of the game under pressure from Hull KR's David Hodgson . With so little between the sides, the first try of the second half was going to be crucial. It went Rovers' way thanks to a scrum 10 metres inside their own half. Rovers went to their blind side where Graeme Horne took on the Saints line and beat them to score a 60-metre try. Burns' bad day with the boot continued as he missed his third conversion from four attempts, but Rovers led 18-10. If Burns had landed all his kicks, Rovers would have been 24-10 up - but they stretched their lead to exactly that on the hour mark when Caro completed his hat-trick. Eden spotted an overlap and used it well to send Caro over in the corner and Burns finally managed to convert from the touchline. Victory was secured with two Hall tries in as many minutes as Saints wilted badly. The second was brilliantly set up by the impressive Eden, who kicked through for Hall to score. The last act went to Eden himself as he rounded off the scoring four minutes from time, Burns converting to leave the final score 40-10.","Chris Chester makes winning start following sacking of Craig Sandercock .

"American life: Michael Moore says he no longer has anything to say about mass shootings following Santa Barbara slayings . The filmmaker behind Bowling for Columbine has responded to calls for comment following the latest U.S. mass shooting. Michael Moore wrote a Facebook post describing America's national symbol as the gun, not the bald eagle. 'With due respect to those who are asking me to comment on last night’s tragic mass shooting ... I no longer have anything to say about what is now part of normal American life,' Moore wrote. 'Everything I have to say about this, I . said it 12 years ago,' he said, referencing his 2002 documentary in . which he explored the possible causes of the horrific Columbine High . School massacre in 1999 carried out by teens Eric Harris and Dylan . Klebold. He goes on to say . that the U.S. is singularly plagued by these violent attacks in part . because of a climate of fear and paranoia and weak gun laws that enable . 'disturbed white males' to get their hands on deadly weapons - legally.Elliot . Rodger was found to have three .9mm semi-automatic gun and more than . 400 rounds of ammunition, all of which was legally purchased and . registered. Moore writes . that while other countries have more violent histories than the U.S., . more guns per capita and consume the same violent movies and video games . as the U.S., but none have anywhere near the rates of mass killings . that America does. '...and yet we don't seem to want to ask ourselves this simple question: ""Why us? What is it about US?""' he writes. Richard Martinez the father of Christopher Martinez who was gunned down by Elliot Rodger echoed Moore's despair. 'When will this insanity stop?' he asked through tears while speaking to the media. 'Why did Chris die? Chris died because of craven, irresponsible politicians and the NRA,” Martinez said, raising his voice. 'They talk about gun rights. What about Chris’s right to live?' Disturbed white males: Moore said that almost all mass shootings are carried out by young men like Elliot Rodger . Bowling for Columbine: Moore says nothing has changed since he made the documentary 12 years ago . The bloodshed is just the latest in what is fast becoming a regular occurrence in the United States, and one that is sure to happen again, says Moore. 'We won't pass the necessary laws, but more importantly we won't consider why this happens here all the time,' he writes. 'When the NRA says, ""Guns don't kill people - people kill people,"" they've got it half-right. Except I would amend it to this: ""Guns don't kill people - Americans kill people.""

"Michael Abberton was visited by Cambridgeshire police on Saturday  after a complaint about a tweet . An education official was visited by police because he had upset Ukip on Twitter. Officers knocked at Michael Abberton’s door to question him about a mocked-up poster he had placed online that criticised the Eurosceptic party’s policies. They asked him about his ‘intentions toward Ukip’ and suggested he should tell no one that the visit had taken place. Mr Abberton, a Green party member, said police had overstepped the mark. The Cambridgeshire force said it had acted over a possible breach of electoral law. But their heavy-handed actions were condemned by civil rights campaigners and politicians from across the political spectrum. David Davis, a former Tory home affairs spokesman, said the incident could have a ‘chilling effect’ on freedom of expression. ‘This is the opposite of what the traditions of British democracy and free speech are all about,’ he said. And the Green Party said it would write to the Home Secretary to demand an investigation into why the visit took place. Mr . Abberton, who works as an assessor for an exam board, used his Twitter . account last week to post a spoof Ukip poster, which supposedly listed . the party’s policies. Mr Abberton was questioned after he posted a picture online mocking what he claimed were UKIP's policies . Cambridgeshire Police later commented on the controversial investigation on their own Twitter feed . The poster had originally been produced by an online activist who was unknown to Mr Abberton. The 47-year-old, from Ramsey, Cambridgeshire, said two officers arrived at his home, one wearing a bodycam to record evidence. ‘It . did stress me out because I didn’t know what to do,’ he said. ‘I . couldn’t believe it had happened. I’ve never had any contact with police . apart from the odd demo.’ Green party member Mr Abberton, who has often attacked UKIP on his Twitter feed, later described the visit from police on his blog . Lib Dem MP Julian Huppert (left) has hit out after police while Green Party leader Natalie Bennett (right) has branded the police investigation 'disturbing' He added: ‘When they asked me to take the . tweet down they said obviously we can’t force you to do that because of . freedom of speech.’ A police spokesman said officers had intervened because the post was sent out a fortnight before European and local elections. He . added: ‘Inquiries were made as to whether any offences had been . committed under the Representation of the People Act but none were . revealed and no further action was taken.’ The . act forbids the publishing of false statements about candidates ahead . of polls, and bans people from impersonating a candidate. The complaint . came from a Ukip councillor. Emma . Carr of Big Brother Watch said: ‘It is time that the police focus on . bringing to justice those who seek harm, not those who cause offence.’ Peter Burkinshaw, secretary of Ukip’s Cambridge branch, said: ‘I don’t understand why the police would go round.’","Green party member Michael Abberton posted picture about Ukip 'policies'

"Arsene Wenger has confirmed that Mikel Arteta will take over the Arsenal club captaincy following the decision to sell Thomas Vermaelen. The Gunners boss, who saw his side beat Manchester City convincingly at Wembley in the Community Shield final, needed a new skipper after allowing Vermaelen to leave for Barcelona, and has opted for the experienced Spanish midfielder to fill the role. Arteta's future has been unclear for much of the summer but with this latest news it looks increasingly likely the 32-year-old will remain at the club this season.

"Non-European migrants living in Britain have cost the public finances almost £120billion since 1995, according to a study. The report by University College London found that the immigrants had cost the country more in public services and State handouts than they had paid in taxes in every single year between 1995 and 2011. The research by Dr Tommaso Frattini and Professor Christian Dustmann – which comes at a time of huge public concern over migration policy – sought to put an overwhelmingly positive gloss on the economic impact of mass immigration. Migrants lining up at the French port town of Calais with some trying to travel to Britain. A new study has found non-European migrants coming to Britain have cost the country £120billion since 1995 . Headline-billing was given to a claim that migrants who arrived from the European Economic Area – predominantly the EU – since 2000 made a net contribution of £20billion. Three-quarters of the contribution – £15billion – was made by people born in the 15 members of the European Union prior to the ‘big bang’ admittance of Eastern Bloc countries in 2004. It includes huge sums paid in by the likes of French bankers and German engineers. A further £5billion came from the East Europeans. Recent non-European immigrants’ net contribution was also said to be positive, at about £5billion. But buried inside the 51-page report was the calculation showing that, if the time period 1995-2011 is considered instead, non-European migrants living in Britain took out more than they put in for 17 consecutive years. For 12 of the past 17 years, native Britons have taken out more in public services and State benefits than they have paid to the Exchequer. Millions of workers will have made a net contribution. But, overall, the drain on the public finances between 1995 and 2011 was more than £541billion – reflecting the significant deficit being racked up in recent years. Factors include rising unemployment and the large welfare bill during the financial crash, which began in 2008. The report ends in 2011 just as the economic recovery is getting under way. Crucially, this group includes all non-EEA migrants – not just the new arrivals since 2000, who Dustmann and Frattini focus upon. In understated language, the study reports: ‘Over the 17 fiscal years considered, the amount of public expenditures received by natives [Britons] exceeds the amount of government revenues they contributed in 12 instances. Although such is also the case for non-EEA immigrants for all 17 fiscal years, it applies to EEA immigrants for seven years.’ The explanation given is that non-EEA nationals – many of whom are likely to have arrived from the Commonwealth – may have been in the UK longer, have more children and a lower employment rate. Overall, the net cost to the UK of non-EEA nationals living in Britain between 1995 and 2011 was nearly £118billion. EEA nationals contributed £4.425billion. Critics will say the report is backward looking – focusing on the taxes paid by the influx of Eastern Europeans when they are young, single and healthy – but not the future burden their families may place on schools, hospitals and the welfare state. Sir Andrew Green, chairman of MigrationWatch, said the report had confirmed that immigration had cost the country vast sums over the past 17 years. He added: ‘As for recent European migrants, even on their own figures, which we dispute, their contribution to the Exchequer amounts to less than £1 per week per head of our population. Meanwhile, they have added one million to the number of people on this island.’ Last night, David Green, director of independent think-tank Civitas, accused the authors of making ‘shallow calculations’ to prove their case, while ignoring the social harms caused by mass immigration. For example, Dustmann and Frattini say immigrants have ‘endowed the UK labour market with human capital that would have cost £49billion through the UK education system’. However, Mr Green says the arrival of well-educated young migrants coincided with a slump in apprenticeships for UK teenagers – at great social cost. There is a huge discrepancy between the financial contribution of migrants born inside and outside the European Economic Area. European migrants living in Britain between 1995 and 2011 made a net contribution of £4.425billion. In only seven of the 17 years did they take out more in services and benefits than they paid in. The group will range from the hundreds of thousands of low-skilled migrants who have arrived from Eastern Europe in recent years to very well paid bankers, fashion designers and engineers from countries such as Germany and France. By contrast, migrants from outside Europe – most of whom arrived from Commonwealth countries – cost the public finances almost £118billion and were a drain in each of the 17 years covered by the report.","Report finds immigrants have cost more in handouts than paid in taxes .

"Striker Luis Suarez had been linked with both Real Madrid and Barcelona following his stunning season at Liverpool. But has his four-month ban for biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup put the mockers on a possible £72million move during the summer? Goodbyes: Uruguay's Luis Suarez is seen embracing a member of the coaching staff on a balcony at the team's hotel in Natal . Barcelona . Barcelona remain interested. Suarez is being touted as the new Hristo Stoichkov, who was prone to moments of madness but formed a vital part of the team that won their first European Cup in 1992. Not all Barca fans are convinced. Many feel that with strikers Neymar and Lionel Messi currently tied for the World Cup Golden Boot, Barcelona don’t need to spend big on a new striker... when they need several new central defenders. Much will depend on whether Barca can persuade Liverpool to reduce the price. Alexis Sanchez may be included in the deal, but everything hangs on Liverpool’s stance. Talisman: Luis Suarez fired Liverpool to second place in Premier League and qualification for Champions League . Real Madrid . Real Madrid president Florentino Perez had turned his attention to Monaco striker Radamel Falcao even before the World Cup. Having won the European Cup, Real do not need to make another big statement. Falcao is a cheaper option than Suarez, while Perez’s favourite Karim Benzema is having a good World Cup. The chances of signing a player banned until November look remote, at least without a huge reduction in Liverpool’s asking price. Perez always has an eye on what a player can earn the club from sponsorship. So with Suarez’s sponsors ready to desert him, Perez’s preference for Falcao will have kicked in.

"The number of Americans who believe in God is declining, as a new poll shows a move away from traditional beliefs. The Harris poll, which questioned more than 2,250 adults about their beliefs, found that those with the strongest faith lived mostly in the South, voted Republican, and were black. The online poll also showed that more Americans were describing themselves at 'not very religious' and that there was an increase in those believing in Darwin's theory of evolution. Keeping the faith: While 74 per cent of Americans still believe in God, the number is declining . Belief: A Harris poll in November questioned 2,250 Americans about their thoughts on God, Darwin and UFOs . While the majority of Americans polled (74 per cent) said they believed in God, the figure was down compared to 2005, 2007 and 2009, when 82 per cent believed. And, where as only 12 per cent of people polled in 2007 described themselves as 'not at all religious' that figure had risen in 2013 to 23 per cent. A decline from previous years was also seen in those believing in heaven, miracles, the devil, and the virgin birth. The poll confirmed that most believers were Republicans and those who lived in the South, while the more cynical were 18 to 36-year-olds who lived on the East Coast. Darwin's theory of evolution was supported by 47 per cent of those questioned, with its biggest supporters being 18 to 36-year-olds and Democrats. Believers: The poll recorded what Americans believed in this year and in previous years . Believers: The poll broke down the results based on age, gender and education . Philosophy: The poll recorded whether people though God was male or female and how much control, if any, he had . Spirituality: Americans were asked whether they believed everything in the Bible was true and if they considered themselves religious . Unsure: The poll showed a decline in the percentage of people certain there was a God . A decline was also seen in the amount of control God has over Earth, with 37 per cent of those asked, including 52 per cent of Catholics, stating that God observed but had not control. This has fallen dramatically in the past ten years, when the figure was 50 per cent. There was evidence of skepticism over magic and aliens, with only 26 per cent of those polled last month saying they believed in witches, 29 per cent believing in astrology and 36 per cent believing in UFOs.","Republicans and those in the South are biggest believers .

"Frantic emergency calls made by students, panicked parents and teachers caught up in the Marysville-Pilchuck High School massacre have been released for the first time. Five teenagers, including the perpetrator, were killed at the Washington state school on October 24 when popular freshman student Jaylen Fryberg opened fire at a group of friends. The chilling audio clips include conversations between police officers and those who witnessed the mass shooting - including  teacher Megan Silberberger, who several survivors have described as a hero for trying to intervene and stop the 15-year-old's gun rampage.

I do not know how many are down,' Silberberger went on. Four teenagers died from injuries sustained in the shooting. One student who was seriously hurt was released from the hospital last week. Jaylen Fryberg killed himself. Students who fled the scene also reported the shooting to 911, describing how they dropped to the ground or bolted from the building. 'I just ran out of the school,' one student told the operator. Victims: Gia Soriano, left, and Shaylee Chuckulnaskit, both 14, died days after the attack from gun wounds .

Elsewhere a woman who lives next to the school - located about 30 miles north of Seattle - called to report that a group of students had climbed over her fence and were hiding at her house. She told the operator that several of the students had witnessed the shooting and asked how long they should stay inside. The operator advised her to hold tight until the police could arrive to interview them. Parents who received calls or texts from their children were frantic for information.

"President Bashar Assad will be 'euphoric' about Obama's decision to wait for Congress over Syria, according to Senator John McCain. One of the loudest critics of the administration's handling of Syria, McCain criticised Obama in an interview on CBS's Face the Nation. Referring to Obama's famous remark when he said the use of chemical weapons in Syria would cross a red line, McCain said: 'He didn't say, ""It's a red line - and by the way I'm going to have to seek the approval of Congress."" He said it was a red line, and that the United States of America would act. 'And that's a big difference, and that's one of the reasons why this is so problematic.' Scroll down for video . Tension: President Bashar Assad will be 'euphoric' about Obama's decision to wait for Congress over Syria, according to Sen. John McCain . Crisis talks: President Obama and Vice-President Biden meet with Secretary of State John Kerry and National Security Advisor Susan Rice to discuss Syria on Sunday . The Arizona Republican, who Obama beat for the presidency in 2008, said the President asked him to come to the White House . specifically to discuss Syria. Obama . is hoping one of Congress's most intractable foreign policy hawks will . help sell the idea of a U.S. military intervention in Syria to a nation . deeply scarred by more than a decade of war. Having . announced over the weekend that he will seek congressional approval for . military strikes against the Assad regime, the Obama administration is . now trying to rally support among Americans and their congressmen and . senators. The . head of the U.N. refugee agency in Syria says seven  million Syrians, . or almost one-third of the population, have been displaced by the . country's civil war. Tarik . Kurdi said that five million of the displaced are still in Syria while . about 2 million have fled to neighboring countries. He says two million children are among those directly affected by the war. Kurdi . says U.N. assistance has been a 'drop in the sea of humanitarian need' and that the funding gap is 'very, very wide.' He says international . donors have sent less than one-third of the money needed to help those . displaced by the war. More than 100,000 Syrians have been killed since an uprising against Syrian President Bashar Assad erupted in 2011. Monday's . meeting with McCain is meant to address concerns of those who feel Obama . isn't doing enough to punish Syrian President Bashar Assad's government . for an attack in the Damascus suburbs last month that the U.S. says . included sarin gas and killed at least 1,429 civilians, more than 400 of . whom were children. On the other side of the spectrum, some Republican . and Democratic lawmakers don't want to see military action at all. Obama's turnabout on Syria sets the stage for the biggest foreign policy vote in Congress since the Iraq war. On . Sunday, Secretary of State John Kerry said the U.S. received new . physical evidence in the form of blood and hair samples that shows sarin . gas was used in the August 21 attack. Kerry said the U.S. must respond . with its credibility on the line. 'We . know that the regime ordered this attack,' he said. 'We know they . prepared for it. We know where the rockets came from. We know where they . landed. We know the damage that was done afterwards.' Kerry's assertion coincided with the beginning of a forceful administration appeal for congressional support. On .

In . an interview with an Israeli television network, he said Obama has . 'encouraged our enemies' by effectively punting his decision to . Congress. He and fellow Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South . Carolina have threatened to vote against Obama's authorization if the . military plan doesn't seek to shift the momentum of the two year civil war toward the rebels trying to oust Assad from power.

September 9. Senior administration officials gave a two-hour classified briefing to dozens of members of Congress in the Capitol on Sunday. Lawmakers . expressed a range of opinions coming out of the meeting, from outright . opposition to strident support for Obama's request for the authorization . to use force. Among . Democrats, Sander Levin of Michigan said he'd approve Obama's . request and predicted it would pass. Elijah Cummings of Maryland . said he was concerned the authorization might be 'too broad.' Pressing issue: The President briefs senior advisers about the situation in Syria . Bennie G. Thompson, the senior Democrat on the House Homeland Security .

"A New Year reveller who became lost when he left a party was found drowned after sending a text to his girlfriend saying: 'At a river. No idea where to go from here'. Warehouse supervisor Michael Simpson, 22, disappeared in the early hours of New Year's Day after wandering off from the fancy dress party to get some fresh air. His girlfriend Jennifer Langley, also 22, sent him a text after he left the party to find out where he was only to get the final response: 'I don’t even know how I ended up here', before his mobile phone went dead. Michael Simpson and his girlfriend Jennifer Langley (left) had seen in the New Year together before he disappeared. They are pictured (right) in a photo which was taken only a few hours before he was last seen . His body was pulled out of the River Goyt in Bredbury, near Stockport, Greater Manchester eight days later. It emerged Michael fell into the water just 150 yards from where the New Year’s Eve party was taking place. A last photo of Mr Simpson with Ms Langley taken by a friend in the kitchen during the party captured him posing with a red fancy dress stethoscope around his neck. Ms Langley told an inquest in Stockport how the couple had seen in the New Year together. Mr Simpson's body was pulled out of the River Goyt in Bredbury, near Stockport, Greater Manchester, eight days after he had disappeared . She said: 'We had a kiss at midnight, but twenty minutes later he had forgotten and gave me another kiss. At this stage he was quite drunk.' Ms Langley said she saw Mr Simpson for the last time at about 2am. She said: 'He looked a bit bored. That was the last time I saw Michael.' She texted Mr Simpson after becoming worried when she could not find him. She said: 'He said he was at a river and had no idea where he was. Ms Langley told the inquest she sent Mr Simpson a text after becoming worried when she could not find him . 'After that I tried ringing him a few times, his phone was dying and mine was as well.' Mr Simpson's first reply to his girlfriend, received by her at 2.23am on New Year’s Day, said: 'At a river. No idea where to go from here.' His second response, at 2.26am, told her to get a taxi back to his house and went on: 'I don’t even know how I ended up here.' The inquest heard she rang him constantly but on failing to get hold of him, she contacted his brother via Facebook around 6am. At 10am she walked to his house hoping she would come across him. But Mr Simpson had failed to return home and his father was already out searching for him. An investigation was launched by the police and it was found he had been spotted on CCTV walking down towards the river. The inquest heard from a security guard who was on the night shift at the nearby Pear Mill industrial estate who said he saw Mr Simpson as he walked past. The guard said as he went to find Mr Simpson he saw him walk across a field and towards the river. Detective Inspector Julie Bowden said the watch Mr Simpson was wearing as he was pulled from the river was 2.30am. She told the coroner that his phone switched off around 2.26am. Det Insp Bowden also confirmed that Mr Simpson had only become lost in the area 150 yards from the party. Pathologist Dr David Shelton confirmed the cause of death was drowning. Toxicology results confirmed there were no drugs found in his system but 228mg of alcohol was found in the blood - around three times more than the drink-drive limit. Giving a verdict of accidental death, Coroner Joanne Kearsley, said drink had played a part in his death. 'He wasn’t found until January 9, but I am satisfied that he has died on January 1. The alcohol was a contributory factor. 'He and Jennifer enjoyed spending time . together. Michael enjoyed life to the full and was often described as . the life and soul of the party' - Denise Simpson . 'There is no suggestion at all that he or anyone else had done anything improper, having left the party Michael had become disorientated, perhaps due to alcohol or perhaps he didn’t know the area or where he was. 'Michael himself realised he was at the river and didn’t know how he had managed to get there. 'He was a young man, he was popular with a lot of people. A number of people helped your family to search in the days he was missing. 'It is abundantly clear that he was a very much loved member of a close family.' In a statement Mr Simpson's mother Denise Simpson said: 'He was a keen Man City supporter, he was planning to watch the game on New Year’s day. 'He and Jennifer enjoyed spending time together. Michael enjoyed life to the full and was often described as the life and soul of the party. He would only drink socially - he wouldn’t smoke or take drugs.' She said she initially thought Mr Simpson had stayed over at his girlfriend's house when he failed to return home. She said: 'Normally he would phone to say he wasn’t coming home. I thought, ""Oh he must’ve just changed his mind and stayed with Jennifer"".’","Michael Simpson, 22, disappeared in early hours of New Year's Day .

"Arsene Wenger believes that the addition of Alexis Sanchez has helped to fill his squad with belief ahead of a Premier League title charge. The Arsenal boss oversaw a 3-0 win at Wembley against Premier League champions Manchester City in the Community Shield and felt his players are now 'united' after having problems with departing players in the past. The Gunners lost a series of big names with Robin van Persie, Samir Nasri and Cesc Fabregas all departing for rivals at home and abroad in recent years but they have recently hung onto their star players while adding to the squad.

'It was a united team performance,' Wenger said of the Wembley win. 'We stopped physically in the second half which was expected but it was a first half of quality, togetherness and good movement. 'In the last two years we’ve added (Mesut) Ozil and Sanchez and every year before that we lost big transfers -so that of course strengthens the squad.' And Wenger praised Sanchez's immediate impact in the Community Shield despite not enjoying a full pre season with his new team mates. 'He's not completely ready but in the first half he was lively it is very promising for the future. 'It will be an interesting season. People who watch the Premier League should be excited because there are so many strong teams in the league.' And Mikel Arteta also believes that Sanchez's addition is making an immediate difference.

Those who packed the red-and-white end of Wembley Stadium on Sunday truly enjoyed this victory, gathering more silver and a slice of revenge over Manchester City — a team who keep poaching their players and smashed six past them at the Etihad last year. When Olivier Giroud lashed a spectacular third into the top corner from 25 yards, the Arsenal supporters launched an impromptu ‘Poznan’ celebration designed to taunt the City fans.

Soon they were singing Arsene Wenger’s name. To think, when his team trailed to Wigan in the FA Cup semi-final, shortly after losing 3-0 at Everton and surrendering the initiative in the race for the top four, it seemed the Frenchman was nearing the end of his Arsenal odyssey. Four months on and his team are heading into this campaign more optimistic than for many years, fuelled by this emphatic scoreline, performance, a clean sheet and goals from Giroud, Santi Cazorla (below) and Aaron Ramsey. It is ever thus in this annual fixture. If it goes badly, as it did for City manager Manuel Pellegrini, then shrug and pretend it was never more than a glorified preparation game. If it goes well, then seize the moment and squeeze out all the positive energy you can. Wenger needed no prompting. He was quick to emphasise the game’s value and bask in his wealth of attacking options. It is remarkable how an FA Cup win can transform the atmosphere at a club. Not the magic of the cup in a traditional sense, but it has cast a spell and the infighting which has plagued Arsenal in recent years has abated. Even Alisher Usmanov, the clubs second largest shareholder, has emerged with an olive branch for owner Stan Kroenke. VIDEO Wenger hails 'complete' Arsenal performance . Mockery: Arsenal fans poked fun at the City supporters by doing the 'Poznan' celebration after the third goal . Crisp finish: Cazorla drove into the bottom right-hand corner with his left foot to open the scoring . Skipping in: Goalkeeper Willy Caballero could do nothing about the effort as it bobbled beyond him . Happy man: Cazorla wheeled away in celebration after finding the net in the 21st minute . More than that, Wenger’s team shows signs that it might be developing nicely into a unit with balance and solidity, as well as its customary flair. The squad remains thin in some areas — like central defence and centre forward — but there were just enough flashes of Alexis Sanchez to leave the crowd wanting more and teenager Calum Chambers has the makings of a composed central defender. Jack Wilshere performed well and Yaya Sanogo proved again that his raw talent is not easy to defend against. City’s young centre halves certainly made it look that way and Sanogo was central to the first two goals. First, he brought down the ball and nudged it to Wilshere. The England man was then flattened by Dedryck Boyata as he allowed the pass to roll on to Cazorla who, in turn, drove it past Willy Caballero. All smiles: Calum Chambers goes over to congratulate the playmaker after he found the net . Linking up so soon: Cazorla gets a hug from Sanchez after opening the scoring in the capital . Sanogo had continued to run into an offside position, arguably across the goalkeeper’s line of sight, but there was no great dispute and Arsenal were ahead, deservedly so. Sanogo then dragged an effort wide, having been released by Cazorla, and forced a save with a header from a corner, before assisting Ramsey for the second. After 16 goals last season, culminating in the winner in the FA Cup final, Ramsey is off and running again. He took the ball from Sanogo, twisted and slammed it low past Caballero, who had been preferred to England No 1 Joe Hart. This may have been a good game for Hart to miss. Caballero was badly exposed by a patchwork back four and Hart could be back for Sunday’s trip to Newcastle. City, however, does not seem like a happy place for English players. Off to a flyer: Ramsey was already on his way to celebrate as the ball hit the back of the net . All too easy: Arsenal were roared forward by Ramsey from midfield and raced into a 2-0 half-time lead . Getting a soaking: The triumphant Arsenal players sprayed each other with champagne afterwards . The manager started with a grand total of none. Clearly he has reservations about Hart and preferred to play Gael Clichy out of position at right-back rather than to start with Micah Richards. It is a side issue. Pellegrini’s greatest worry will be the way his team defended all over the pitch, even if they were without so many stars because he refused to consider those who had played beyond the group stages of the World Cup. Arsenal were missing their own German trio of World Cup winners but looked slicker and more competitive, ready for the challenges ahead, which include a Champions League play-off tie with Besiktas. The season looks to be upon City a little too soon, though Pellegrini is safe in the knowledge he judged last season’s run perfectly. Shut your eyes: Oxlade-Chamberland, Wilshere, Cazorla, Sanchez and Arteta smile after getting wet . Picture perfect: Cazorla borrows a camera and takes a selfie with full back Nacho Monreal on the pitch . The champions improved in the second half. David Silva added intelligence to their football which provided a lift and Stevan Jovetic hit a post with a header, having beaten Mathieu Debuchy in the air. Wojciech Szczesny then denied him with a smart save, low to his right. Giroud put the outcome beyond doubt on the hour, with an eye-catching strike which beat Caballero, having clipped Matija Nastasic to acquire the added loop required to find the top corner. Cue the Poznan and dancing in the aisles. ‘Our doctor thinks it could be broken — and that will be four to six weeks minimum. ‘But I’m pleased for Scott Gallacher, who has come in from Rangers a few weeks ago, as he wants to play football and he will get that opportunity here now.’ Here to stay: Olivier Giroud points to the Arsenal badge after thundering home the third from difference . Over him in a flash! Willy Caballero could do nothing about Giroud's stinging effort from distance . Have that: Giroud took one touch before unleashing an unstoppable shot on Caballero's goal .

"Luis Suarez's lawyer will travel to Barcelona on Friday, according to reports in Spain. Spanish radio station Cadena COPE are reporting the Uruguayan frontman's attorney, Alejandro Balbi, is to meet Liverpool officials in the city.

Meeting: Luis Suarez's lawyer is set to meet Liverpool officials in Barcelona on Friday, according to reports . Homeward bound: Suarez will return to Uruguay and play no further part in the World Cup following his ban . Suarez, who has been linked with a move to Barcelona as well as Spanish rivals Real Madrid, will also miss Uruguay's next nine fixtures. The news comes just a day after Balbi claimed England and Italy were responsible for a witchhunt against the frontman. In an incredible interpretation of the events that unfolded on Tuesday, Suarez's lawyer told Uruguayan radio: ‘We don’t have any doubts that this has happened because it’s Suarez involved, and secondly because Italy have been eliminated. 'There’s a lot of pressure from England and Italy. 'There is a possibility that they ban him, because there are precedents, but we’re convinced that it was an absolutely casual play, because if Chiellini can show a scratch on one shoulder, Suarez can show a bruised and almost closed eye.’ Wanted man: Suarez has been linked with moves to Barcelona and Real Madrid this summer . Step 1: Suarez approaches Chiellini from behind during a Uruguay attack . Stage 2: The Liverpool striker moves his head close to Chiellini's shoulder as he prepares to attack .

"The country retreat that jazz legend George Melly bought after selling off part of his prized art collection has gone on sale for £650,000. The hard-living musician parted with a Picasso drawing, a Klee watercolour and a Magritte oil to buy the converted medieval tower with its own stretch of the River Usk. The flamboyant performer, known for his fedoras, loud suits and louder ties, used the Welsh hideaway to indulge his passion for fly fishing and spent many family holidays there with his wife, Diana, and their children. Scroll down for video . George Melly sold off part of his art collection to buy this country fishing retreat in village of Screthrog near Brecon, Mid Wales . When the infamous hellraiser, best known for his distinctively growled jazz vocals, was not in residence at the 14th Century listed building, known as 'The Tower,'  his wife, Diana, ran it as a bed and breakfast. The jazzman owned the property between 1971 and 1999. In the late 1990s the three bedroom property  in the secluded village of Screthrog near Brecon, Mid Wales,  became too much and Melly sold it. Up until then the hard living singer regularly performed at the nearby Brecon Jazz Festival. Melly died aged 80 at his London home in 2007 from lung cancer and emphysema.

"Dominique Strauss-Kahn was released from house arrest in New York yesterday as the sexual assault case against him teetered on the verge of collapse. A dramatic court hearing in Manhattan saw the French former head of the International Monetary Fund given back his £3.7million bail money. A security tag on his ankle was also removed. Prosecutors admitted there were ‘serious credibility issues’ with his accuser, a maid who said he tried to rape her in May at the Manhattan hotel where she worked. All smiles: The credibility of the witness led to Strauss-Kahn being released from house arrest . Law enforcement officials believe the  32-year-old Guinean immigrant has repeatedly lied to them and may have links to drug dealing and money laundering. Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi-Orbon told the court: ‘It’s clear that the strength of this case has been affected by substantial credibility issues with the witness.’ Strauss-Kahn, 62, who denies attempted rape and serious sexual assault, left the court smiling and with his arm around his wife, Anne Sinclair, after a judge lifted his stringent bail conditions. He had been held in a Manhattan house under armed guard. Judge Michael Obus acknowledged that the risk of Strauss-Kahn absconding ‘had receded quite a bit’ but said he was ‘in no rush to judgment’ on the case. The charges have not yet been dismissed and the court will hold on to Strauss-Kahn’s passport. But, in a stunning reversal in the case, the spotlight has shifted to his accuser. She claims Strauss-Kahn subjected her to a vicious sex attack when she came to clean his suite at the Sofitel hotel, telling investigators he was naked and chased her across the room. Forensic tests have revealed the pair definitely had a sexual encounter, but defence lawyers have claimed it was consensual. While public opinion has so far weighed heavily against Strauss-Kahn, who has a reputation as an aggressive womaniser, the maid’s lawyer had portrayed her as a hard-working single mother and devout Muslim. But according to law enforcement officials who spoke to the New York Times, that image appears to be very far from the truth. Two official sources said the unnamed woman spoke on the telephone to an imprisoned alleged drug dealer within a day of her encounter with Strauss-Kahn. In the conversation, which was recorded, she reportedly discussed the possible benefits of pursuing the charges against Strauss-Kahn. Investigators also say they learnt that the man on the other end of the phone, who is accused of possessing 400lb of marijuana, is among several people who put cash deposits amounting to more than £62,000 into the maid’s bank account over the past two years. In addition, the woman has been paying hundreds of dollars each month in phone charges to five companies even though she told police she had only one phone. She allegedly told officials that she  knew only that the deposits were made by a man she described as her fiancé and his friends. Prosecutors also say they discovered inconsistencies in her account of her past life. She is said to have lied about details on her application for asylum in the U.S., including saying she had been gang-raped by soldiers in Guinea. Investigators said they also  found a discrepancy between her account of how she had been subjected to genital mutilation and the version she had provided in her asylum application. In a letter to the court Miss Illuzzi-Orbon laid out in detail the problems with the alleged victim. In her application for asylum to the U.S. for herself and her daughter in 2004 she said that the home she shared with her husband in Guinea was burned by soldiers for the country’s regime. Her husband was then supposedly tortured in jail where he died of his injuries.According to prosecutors she later admitted this was a lie. Prosecutors also said that she cried when she recounted to them the story from her asylum application of how she had been gang-raped in Guinea, but later admitted that this was also a lie. She also allegedly owned up to falsely claiming a friend’s child as her own to get a higher tax refund, and misrepresenting her income to stay in her present home. Her lawyer, Kenneth Thompson, admitted outside court that her asylum application was ‘not completely accurate’ but accused New York’s district attorney of deserting his client because he was scared of losing such a high profile case. He also said suggestions his client was involved in drug dealing were a ‘lie’ and claimed the maid’s daughter had told him that prosecutors had ‘mistreated’ and ‘screamed at’ her mother while interviewing her. Although prosecutors have revealed their doubts about the maid, they stressed they have not necessarily changed their mind about the charges against Strauss-Kahn.

"A Pennsylvania doctor is being hailed a hero today after he seriously injured a patient who went on a shooting spree in his office. Dr. Lee Silverman, a psychiatrist, told police that the patient, identified as Richard Plotts, fatally shot a caseworker at their hospital complex before the doctor pulled out his own gun and exchanged fire with him and wounded him, a prosecutor said Thursday night. Silverman was grazed in the temple during the gunfight in his office, according to Delaware District Attorney Jack Whelan. Yeadon Police Chief Donald Molineux said that 'without a doubt, I believe the doctor saved lives.' Scroll down for video . Hero: This screen grab is believed to show Dr. Lee Silverman, who fired back at Richard Plotts when the psychiatric patient opened fire on Thursday at Mercy Fitzgerald Hospital . SWAT: Police gather at the scene of a shooting at the Mercy-Fitzgerald Hospital in Darby . 'Without that firearm, this guy (the patient) could have went out in the hallway and just walked down the offices until he ran out of ammunition,' the chief said. Whelan identified the caseworker killed Thursday afternoon at Mercy Fitzgerald Hospital as Theresa Hunt, 53. Hunt, who was from Philadelphia, had accompanied Plotts to an appointment with Silverman at a psychiatric crisis center adjacent to the hospital in Darby, just southwest of Philadelphia, authorities said. 'When the caseworker was shot, (Silverman) crouched down behind the desk to avoid him being shot,' Whelan said. 'He was able to reach for his weapon, and realizing it was a life or death situation, was able to engage the defendant in the exchange of gunfire.' A hospital worker views police activity after the frightening shooting . An officer stands guard near where a doctor grazed by gunfire from a patient who had entered his office in a suburban hospital's psychiatric unit stopped him by returning fire with his own gun and injuring him . A struggle ensued and spilled out into the hallway, Whelan said. Another doctor and a caseworker jumped in to help Silverman and secure Plotts' weapon, he said. The motive for the shooting remained unclear late Thursday, although Whelan said Plotts, of Upper Darby, might have had issues with the doctor over his treatment plan. However, it's unclear if that's why Silverman was armed, apparently against hospital policy. 'We do believe that there were some issues between the doctor and the patient, but whether or not he actually feared him is unclear,' the prosecutor said. 'From all accounts, (he) would have acted in self-defense.' Whelan said that Plotts, 49, was still in surgery Thursday evening at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, while Silverman had been treated and released. Telephone calls to the doctor's home went unanswered. Fatal shooting: Several victims were reported after shots were fired at the Darby Borough hospital and at least one victim has died . Suspect: Shots broke out around 2pm but by 3pm reports from the scene indicated the suspected shooter was in custody . Plotts does not have a listed home phone number. Court records in Delaware County show a man of the same name and age with a lengthy criminal record, but Whelan was uncertain if they were the same person. The hospital has a policy barring anyone except on-duty law enforcement officers from carrying weapons on its campus, a spokeswoman for the Mercy Health System said. But Molineux insisted Silverman was a hero who saved lives. Two guns were recovered from the scene, Whelan said. Staff members had heard loud arguing inside Silverman's office during the appointment. They opened the door and noticed the patient had a gun pointed at the doctor, so they quietly closed the door and dialed 911, Whelan said. Gunshots were heard a short time later, just before 2:30 p.m. Terrifying: Around 100 terrified people ran out of the hospital's wellness center as SWAT teams rushed in . Hospital workers view police activity at the scene of a shooting Thursday at Mercy Fitzgerald Hospital in Darby, Pennsylvania . About 100 people were evacuated. The shooting reportedly occurred on a third floor psych ward . Standing ready: A police officer carries his weapon near the scene of a shooting at the Mercy Fitzgerald Hospital in Darby . Plotts, severely wounded from several shots, emerged from the office, and another doctor and a caseworker helped wrestle him to the floor of the hallway and grabbed his weapon, Whelan said. 'They acted vigilantly. They acted bravely,' he said. The exchange of gunfire occurred on the third floor of the Wellness Center at Mercy Fitzgerald, a 204-bed community teaching hospital. Authorities said there are no surveillance cameras in the doctor's office or the waiting area outside. They also said the center had no metal detectors. Patients waiting in the first-floor lobby reported a tense scene when police arrived and ordered everyone out. Most of the patients were elderly. 'I dozed off, and I heard the cop shouting, ""Come on, come on, get out!""' said Millicent Russell, of Lansdowne, who was waiting for a 3 p.m. appointment.

"A panda toy sparked a terror alert at Mauritius Airport after the owner posed it for a selfie-style picture with a plane in the background. Security officials demanded that Nicole Kennedy, 20, hand over her mobile phone after they saw her take the picture, claiming it could help terrorists. Since buying the £15 stuffed animal from Edinburgh Zoo last year, Miss Kennedy has taken dozens of 'selfies' with him in front of the Kelpies and Forth Bridge, as well as in Mauritius and South Africa. Nicole Kennedy, 20, was accused of helping a terror plot after taking this selfie-style shot of her cuddly panda toy in front of a jet a Mauritius Airport . But when she posed 'Panda Kennedy' for a shot in the airport, it nearly ended in arrest. She said: 'It was such a beautiful view that I just knew I had to take a photo with Panda Kennedy. 'Suddenly, a very official looking man came over and sternly told me off, saying that photos were prohibited and it was a threat to security. Miss Kennedy said the man ordered her to hand over her mobile, but she refused and backed away until he gave up . 'There were no signs informing passengers of this. 'I'm not sure what he thought I was going to do with a stuffed panda and a cellphone but he sure took his job seriously enough. 'He kept walking while he insisted on having a look at my phone. 'I had Panda Kennedy clutched tightly in my hand and he wanted to know what I was doing with him. 'My hopes of explaining my Panda selfie idea was probably not going to come across well. 'I moved away as fast as possible. He thankfully gave up.' A spokesman from the Mauritian embassy in London said: 'Many airports across the world do not allow you to take pictures inside for security reasons. 'We have to prevent people from taking photos - there are terrorists all over the world.' Panda Kennedy has been photographed dozens of times, including the Bass Rock, East Lothian, and the Falkirk Wheel. The Cascade Waterfall in Mauritius also features among the snaps. Miss Kennedy added: 'His next adventure will probably be Kruger National Park or Cape Town. Miss Kennedy bought the stuffed animal, which she has named Panda Kennedy, at Edinburgh Zoo last year and has since posed him for pictures dozens of times - including in front of the Kelpies (pictured) Miss Kennedy, whose parents are originally from Scotland, has also taken pictures with the bear in her home of Mauritius and has never run into trouble - until now .

"New demands: Ed Miliband has listed six criteria the Government needs to fulfill for Labour to support military action . A divided Labour party yesterday issued a tortured statement on Syria, claiming David Cameron had failed to produce ‘compelling evidence’ showing the Assad regime had deployed chemical weapons. Throwing the Government’s plans for a vote on imminent missile attacks into chaos, Ed Miliband’s party did not come out and oppose intervention, but claimed any action would have to meet six gruelling criteria which could take weeks to fulfil. An amendment released last night by Labour fell well short of the Government’s conviction that dictator Bashar al-Assad had used poison gas on his own people - simply condemning his ‘killing of hundreds of civilians’. A day after Mr Miliband said he would consider backing a ‘limited’ use of force, the party changed its position by saying they would not agree until they saw ‘compelling evidence’ chemical weapons were used by Assad’s forces. They said they needed to see a full report by the United Nations weapons inspectors and for this report to be voted on by the UN Security Council. They further demand a ‘clear basis in international law’ for involvement and a vote in parliament on action, which they insisted had to be ‘legal, proportionate, time-limited and have precise and achievable objectives designed to deter the future use of prohibited chemical weapons.’ These demands were then echoed in the Government motion which was released last night ahead of today’s vote. Mr Miliband who was briefed on the military intelligence from Syria in Downing Street on Tuesday, backtracked amid growing turmoil within his party over the prospect intervention in the civil war-ravaged country and accusations it could drag Britain into an Iraq-style quagmire. A senior Labour source summed up the . party’s position as: ‘We have essentially reached a decision that we . cannot give the Prime Minister a blank cheque tomorrow’.

A . member of the shadow cabinet accused Mr Miliband of having ‘slammed . into reverse gear’ after being told he was moving too quickly. One . member of his frontbench, public health minister Diane Abbott, said she . would consider resigning over if forced to support an intervention that . was not ‘legal’. Miss Abbott, who voted against the Iraq War, broke . ranks yesterday to say: ‘At the moment, I can’t see anything that would . make me vote for intervention in Syria.’ Anti-action: Diane Abbott called Syria a complex civil war . In . an outspoken interview she argued against Britain being ‘stampeded into . action, warning against ‘delivering military punishment beatings’ and . said there was no reason to believe military strikes would be legal, or . would do anything to ‘stop Assad fighting to the last Syrian.’ ‘Essentially it’s a civil war’, she said. ‘What Libya and Egypt have taught us is that these situations in the Middle East are complex. It’s not good guys in white hats and bad guys in black hats’. ‘The danger is we get dragged into an open ended involvement in a Syrian civil war....the truth is the British people have seen this movie, they know how it ends and that’s why the public is two to one against bombing Syria’ Mr Miliband, who told David Cameron this week that intervention in Syria had to be ‘limited’, yesterday went further insisting on waiting for the report by the small team of chemical weapons specialists who have begun inspections in Ghutah, in the east of Syria on Monday and will be there until at least tomorrow. Not only will their report need to be scrutinised by the Security Council but it will have to be voted on by them - despite the fact Assad’s backers, Russia and China are among its five permanent members. Mr Miliband’s amendment went even further to confirm ‘such action relates solely to efforts to deter the use of chemical weapons and does not sanction any wider action in Syria.’","Miliband said he would consider backing 'limited force' on Tuesday .

"Helen Louise Turnbull, pictured, was confronted by the father of her alleged victim who warned her that he would have punched her had she been a man . A man has told a court how he confronted a teaching assistant in his street after he found out she had been having sex with his teenage son. Teesside Crown Court heard that, full of fury and in front of neighbours, he told 35-year-old Helen Louise Turnbull: 'You are a paedophile and if you had been a man I would hit you, but I'm not going to jail for someone like you.' The 16-year-old boy's father had seen her in her Mini parked 75m from his house, and was incensed when she got out of the car in a 'ridiculously short' dress. He told the jury: 'She had to pull the dress down when she got out of the car. 'All I could think of was ""She's dressed in a mini-dress, high heels and a full face of make-up and she's not there to see me, she's come to see my son"".' Turnbull, a married mother-of-two, has admitted kissing the pupil but said their secret relationship went no further. She admits one count of sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust but denies three further counts which relate to allegations that they had sex and on two separate occasions that she performed sex acts on him in her Mini. The witness told the court he found out from his brother about his son's affair, and he went to the school and police. The teenager was worried about a threat she had made to him about having him 'shot' by a local family when their affair cooled, the father said. 'He was scared to death,' he added. The boy's father reassured him by following in his car as he walked to school with friends. His father then drove home and spotted Turnbull, known at school as Miss Robson, parked in the street. By this stage the affair was over and the police had begun investigating. He recognised her because he had seen her picture on Facebook, he said. She got out of her Mini and said 'something like ""Can I have a word with you?""' he said. 'I was fuming, I was mad,' he said. Ms Turnbull, pictured has admitted  one count of sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust but denies two counts of having sex with the teen in her car and a third count of performing a sex act on him . Defence solicitor Ann Richardson asked the boy whether he had exaggerated the scale of the relationship with Ms Turnbull, pictured, which he denied, claiming that he felt 'disgusted about what we did' The father shouted and swore at her and called her a paedophile, to which she replied: 'No, it's not like that.' He shouted her down, recalling: 'I was mad, I kept shouting ""You are a paedophile"".' He added: 'I think I told her to stop threatening him and leave him alone.' He recalled: 'Because I was shouting, people started coming out of the houses to see what was going on.' The court has heard that Turnbull, from Haswell, County Durham, groomed him by giving him sweets and cuddles, and then embarked on an affair with him in secret meetings at an industrial estate. Earlier, the court was told that both Turnbull and the boy had agreed not to tell their respective friends about their relationship because of the impact it would have on her marriage and her job. Anne Richardson, defending, asked the boy why he broke the agreement and told his friends. Via a videolink, the teenager replied: 'It's lads' craic. 'At the time I was saying one thing to her and when I'm out with the boys, I'm obviously going to be telling them what we have been up to.' Teesside Crown Court, pictured, heard that the boy 'regretted' the effect the affair had on their lives . The boy said Turnbull also broke the agreement by telling one of her friends what was going on. He felt 'embarrassed and disgusted' with himself and with her when his father found out, he said. Miss Richardson asked: 'How did you feel about the police becoming involved?' He replied: 'The whole situation shouldn't have happened. 'I regretted what happened, because of the effect it had on my life and on Miss Robson's life.' The pupil denied Miss Richardson's suggestion that he was exaggerating what they had done together. 'I have never exaggerated,' he said. 'Even if that was the case now, I feel disgusted about what we did.' The trial continues.

"These impressive aerial photographs are the work of David Maisel, who specializes in taking large-scaled, otherworldly pictures of natural terrain that has been modified by human intervention such as mining for valuable natural resources. Maisel has photographed such areas of environmental degradation for almost 30 years. Wherever he goes he hires a local pilot and a small plane to take him up anywhere from 500 to 11,000 feet in altitude where he can take his pictures. His unaltered photographs of the landscapes are beautiful but at the same unnerving. What exactly has happened to produce these strange mutilations of natural beauty.

A new book, Black Maps: American Landscape and the Apocalyptic Sublime, collects over 100 of Maisel’s photographs of open-pit mines, toxic waste sites, logging, freeways and other scenes that mark the toll humans have left on the earth. 'Maisel’s work over the past two decades has argued for an expanded definition of beauty, one that bypasses glamor to encompass the damaged, the transmuted, the decomposed,' write Leah Ollman of the Los Angeles Times.

"When it was announced the G20 leaders' meeting would be coming to Australia, those living in Brisbane were assured the summit would be no interruption to their daily lives. However, video shot on Tuesday showing a US aircraft whipping up an almighty dust cloud which engulfs a highway suggests otherwise. The footage shows a two tilt-rotor Osprey aircraft practicing a landing near the busy Inner City Bypass in Brisbane when it hits an unexpected spot of trouble. Scroll down for video . During a drill on Tuesday ahead of G20 this weekend US aircraft caused dramas when it whipped up a huge dust cloud . At first the aircraft appeared to be simply completing normal practice . The plume of red dust stirred up as the The United States Marine Corps (USMC) aircraft got closer to the ground stopped motorists driving along the six-lane strip in their tracks as the massive cloud spread. At first the dust cloud covered only a small amount of space around the aircraft itself, but less than 30 seconds later it has completely engulfed the surrounding area. ABC Radio National presenter  Rhianna Patrick described the planes to the ABC as 'celebrities' of the aircraft world and revealed they are not often spotted Down Under. However as the Osprey started its descent it stirred up a huge red dust cloud . The dust spread across the road and onto the busy Inner City Bypass in Brisbane . At one stage it engulfed the motorway making it near impossible for drivers to see . 'We all know these aircraft purely through cinema, through news, they are like the celebrities of the aviation world,' the keen plane spotter said. 'Air Force One is probably the most recognised aircraft in the world, closely followed by Marine One, which is what the Sea King helicopter is called when it is carrying the president,' Ms Patrick continued. It's not the first air power that's been spotted flexing its muscles at Victoria Park Gold Club at Herston leading up to the G20. All of the world leaders have brought aircraft to Australia with them, however the American planes are arguably the most impressive.","A US Osprey aircraft was taking part in a drill ahead of the G20 .

"Iconic role: Angela Lansbury, here in Murder She Wrote, has let men in on a few home truths about marriage . She endeared herself to millions as the crime-solving writer Jessica Fletcher. When it comes to solving marriage problems, however, actress Angela Lansbury may not have quite so many fans – at least, not among the male half of the species. Contrary to what they might think, according to the 87-year-old the key to wedded bliss is definitely not sex. And, worse, she claims some women have become so exasperated with men that they turn to other women instead. Miss Lansbury, who was married for 54 years, said a ‘good man’ should try to make his marriage work by realising sex is not the be all and end all. The actress, most famous for the long-running television series Murder, She Wrote, said: . ‘Unfortunately, what goes on in bed has come to be considered all-important, but that really isn’t the most important thing in a relationship, ultimately. It’s not the thing that’s going to support a marriage necessarily through 40 or 50 years. ‘I think a good man is someone who pays attention to a marriage and is prepared to work at it.’ Miss Lansbury, whose 70-year career has spanned the stage, film and TV, has been married twice. Her first marriage, to American actor Richard Cromwell, lasted just a year, ending in divorce in 1946. After that she married British actor and businessman Peter Shaw, with whom she had two children. Mr Shaw died in 2003. The couple had been married for 54 years. Marriage tips: Angela Lansbury, pictured in 1946, shared her relationship secrets after being married to her own husband for 54 years . Alternative take on marriage: Barbara Taylor Bradford, with her husband Robert Bradford, has advice men might find more palatable . Of Mr Shaw, she said: ‘Peter was one of . the handsomest men you’ll ever see. He was friendly, a sportsman, a very . good businessman, and a terrific guy.’ But today’s women are unlikely to be so fortunate. Miss Lansbury, the granddaughter of 1930s Labour Party leader George Lansbury, said: ‘Women are now suffering for the lack of enough men to go around. Many women have given up. In many cases I think women prefer to have a relationship with a woman. ‘Anyway, there are many inherent differences between the sexes. It can be an area that is insurmountable and women put up with a hell of a lot. Not necessarily philandering, I mean generally. ‘Men are going to get up to some nonsense sometimes and we don’t want to know about it. Well we do ultimately!’ Chaps may prefer the marriage advice of real-life writer Barbara Taylor Bradford, who last month advised wives they should admire their husbands. Miss Taylor Bradford, 79, who has been married to film producer Bob Bradford for almost 50 years, said: ‘I think that, basically, you can’t just be in love with man. ‘You have to work at marriage. You have to like and respect the man you are married to.’","Angela Lansbury was  married for 54 years .

The man, who is believed to have been in his 20s, was arrested with two other men in a raid by the Pakistani Special Investigations Unit. The men were held following a police operation in the Korangi Awami Colony on Wednesday. One of the suspects, pictured,  was wearing a t-shirt from the Edinburgh Dungeon tourist attraction . Police displayed the three suspects and three weapons following a raid in Karachi earlier today . Pakistani police tracked down the three men following a botched robbery in the Gulistan Johar area of the city last month. Two of the men entered the bank without wearing any disguises and were captured on CCTV. It is understood that the gang shot one guard who returned fire forcing them to retreat. The men stole a small sum of cash as well as a mobile phone belonging to one of the staff. The men escaped from the scene on motorbikes. During the raid, police recovered two semi-automatic handguns and a chromed pump-action shotgun. Police stood guard while the men and the weapons were shown to the press earlier today. The men were hooded and handcuffed to each other as the media photographed the haul. As well as the gift t-shirt from the Edinburgh Dungeon, the man had a sticker with the word 'extremist' attached to the garment.","Pakistani police arrested three suspected bank robbers earlier today .

"Police have arrested an 18-year-old man on suspicion of shooting and killing an Army veteran on a sidewalk in the San Fernando Valley. A witness claims that Vincent Estrada shouted 'are you ready for this' before opening fire. Estrada was arrested Tuesday in the Sylmar area and booked on suspicion of murder, Los Angeles police spokeswoman Officer Nuria Vanegas said. Scroll down for video . Mourning: A friend of Mr Garcia cries next to flowers and candles placed on the sidewalk where he was shot . Vincent Estrada (not pictured) was arrested Tuesday in the Sylmar area and booked on suspicion of murder, Los Angeles police spokeswoman Officer Nuria Vanegas said . Vanegas says she had no information on the motive behind Sunday's attack on Francisco Garcia, but police suggested that a dispute between the pair that erupted earlier in the evening may be linked. Police and witnesses said 21-year-old Mr Garcia had left a party at his girlfriend's house when two cars pulled up to him. A man in one of the cars jumped out, smashed a beer bottle on the ground and yelled at Garcia. Investigators said the killer then walked to the other car, grabbed a handgun and allegedly began shooting at Garcia. Garcia had returned from Afghanistan over the summer. Brian Enriquez, 21, who had been friends with Mr Garcia since they were in sixth grade, is overcome with grief at the scene of the shooting . Los Angeles police Lt. Paul Vernon told reporters that 'the ironies are obvious. To survive as a soldier in an overseas conflict, only to be killed in your neighborhood upon your return.' Vernon said: 'Apparently a simmering dispute had boiled over during the night, and this suspect came looking for Francisco.' Authorities talked to several witnesses and collected evidence, including several bullet casings. Brian Enriquez, 21, told the Los Angeles Times that the suspect said: 'Are you ready for this?' before opening fire. 'He was a very loving, caring person,' Enriquez said. 'He would always have a smile on his face. An all-around amazing individual.'

"Lewis Hamilton has called on old friend Ron Dennis to do the 'smart' thing and retain 'star quality' driver Jenson Button. Button heads into Formula One's off-season still unsure whether his 15-year career in the sport is over or if he will be handed a new contract by McLaren. McLaren Group CEO Dennis has confirmed to Press Association Sport the situation will not be resolved until after a board meeting in early December. Jenson Button (left) is still unsure whether his 15-year career in the sport is over . It leaves 34-year-old Button and team-mate Kevin Magnussen in limbo until Dennis and his fellow shareholders deliberate over who should partner the returning Fernando Alonso from next season. Hamilton, fresh from clinching his second F1 title in Abu Dhabi on Sunday, is in no doubt former team-mate Button should be snapped up by Dennis. Hamilton said: 'Jenson's been in Formula One for a long time, he's had an exceptional career, and he's still young. 'On Sunday he drove incredibly well to bring a McLaren up to fifth, and with a great driver (Magnussen) alongside him who wasn't able to do the same with the same car.

There are only 18 or 20 seats. 'But he (Button) has proven time and again he is still a worthy competitor and a valuable asset for any team to have. 'I've known Ron for a long, long time and he is passionate about racing.

Hamilton, pictured with Ron Dennis (right) in 2008, has called on his friend to retain Button at McLaren . Button, meanwhile, is the latest to hail Hamilton 'a worthy winner' of this season's championship, and firmly believes he could make it three next year given Mercedes' dominance is expected to continue in 2015. 'One world championship is enough for any racing driver, but to win two is out of this world,' said Button. 'So very well done to him.

"Appearing on the cover of Newsweek, Barack Obama looks coy, half-smiling, half-surprised, gracefully clutching his suit jacket slung over his shoulder. It might appear to be some sort of watch advertisement were it not for Niall Ferguson's blazing headline 'Hit the Road, Barack: Why We Need a New President.' The article sizes him up on his economic and foreign relations accomplishments, as well as announces the rise of his apparent new nemesis: Paul Ryan. Hey Girl: Newsweek's cover might appear to be some sort of watch advertisement were it not for Niall Ferguson's blazing headline 'Hit the Road, Barack: Why We Need a New President' Niall Ferguson, a British professor of history at Harvard University, relies heavily on the idea of promises to lampoon Barack Obama into submission - a surprising argument for the historically liberal, and pro-Obama publication. It is urgent, he argues, to lose the rhetoric and spring for reform. 'I was a good loser four years ago,' he writes. As a 'full disclosure' adviser to John McCain, his sentiments are hardly surprising, but he does not rely on opinion to make his case. Drawing heavily on unemployment numbers, stagnant growth on the economy and expert dissatisfaction, he presents Mr Obama as a lame duck. 'It is five years since the financial crisis began, but the central problems—excessive financial concentration and excessive financial leverage—have not been addressed,' Mr Ferguson writes. But more than just his policies are the problem, Mr Ferguson says, it's his decision making abilities. Campaign: Campaign: The article reads like a report card for the current POTUS . Stop: Drawing heavily on unemployment numbers, stagnant growth on the economy and expert dissatisfaction, he presents Mr Obama as a lame duck . 'After the imperial presidency of the Bush era, there was something more like parliamentary government in the first two years of Obama’s administration,' Mr Ferguson writes. 'The president proposed; Congress disposed.' 'The voters now face a stark choice,' Mr Ferguson says. 'They can let Barack Obama’s rambling, solipsistic narrative continue until they find themselves living in some American version of Europe, with low growth, high unemployment, even higher debt—and real geopolitical decline.' The nail in the coffin will be Paul Ryan, Mr Ferguson argues. The two met in 2010 at a fundraising dinner. Competition: It is urgent, the writer argues, to lose the rhetoric and spring for reform . 'Ryan blew me away. I have wanted to see him in the White House ever since,' Mr Ferguson writes. While Mr Ryan possesses the charm that Mr Obama once mastered, Mitt Romney harnesses the private sector experience, and leadership, that Mr Obama has always lacked. 'Now Obama is going head-to-head with his nemesis: a politician who believes more in content than in form, more in reform than in rhetoric,' Mr Ferguson writes. His analysis is not without controversy, however, as New York Times columnist Paul Krugman has called him out on an error. Reception: The public reception of the cover has been hot and cold . No Thanks: Some readers announced their allegiance to Newsweek, while other readers pronouncing their disdain . Reverse: Still, other readers thought the controversial cover might be a boost for Barack . 'There are multiple errors and misrepresentations in Niall Ferguson’s cover story in Newsweek — I guess they don’t do fact-checking,' Mr Krugman writes on his blog. He refers to this passage of the piece: . 'The president pledged that health-care reform would not add a cent to the deficit. But the CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation now estimate that the insurance-coverage provisions of the ACA will have a net cost of close to $1.2 trillion over the 2012–22 period.' And then declares: . 'Readers are no doubt meant to interpret this as saying that CBO found that the Act will increase the deficit. But anyone who actually read, or even skimmed, the CBO report (pdf) knows that it found that the ACA would reduce, not increase, the deficit — because the insurance subsidies were fully paid for.' He calls on Newsweek to correct the 'plain misrepresentation of the facts.' POLITICO called out editor Tina Brown for the gaffe. 'Tina Brown certainly swings for the fences,' they write. 'She just puts a little too much pine tar on the bat.' Spice: Since Tina Brown took the helm of the floundering publication, she has made it her mission to spice up the covers with controversial images of bondage or a heavily photoshopped Princess Diana . Since Mrs Brown took the helm of the floundering publication, she has made it her mission to spice up the covers with controversial images of bondage or a heavily Photoshopped Princess Diana. The public reception of this cover has been hot and cold, with some readers announcing their allegiance to Newsweek, while others pronouncing their disdain. The paper created the hashtag #HitTheRoadBarack to keep track of the discussion. 'I will never ever purchase another @Newsweek magazine #HitTheRoadBarack Thank You @nfergus #SubscriptionCanceled,' tweeted one reader. 'Chronic unemployment, stagnant economic growth, unsustainable deficits, no plan. Yes, it's time to #HitTheRoadBarack,' wrote another. Still, some readers thought the cover was just another attempt at stirring the pot - in the POTUS's favor. '#HitTheRoadBarack Not to burst anyone's bubble,' one reader wrote, 'but Newsweek might be trying the old reverse psychology. Trash Barry, to energize his base.' After all, it was not so long ago that the same magazine proclaimed Mitt Romney was 'too insecure' to be president. The now iconic image that graces this cover of Newsweek was taken by Associated Press photographer Carolyn Kaster. Taken . on August 12, the image is one in a series of nine of the President . walking on a lush green street with secret service trailing him close . behind. He seems at ease, happy, as if he is surrounded by good friends. The . captain reads: 'President Barack Obama speaks to media as he walks . through his Hyde Park neighborhood to a campaign event, Sunday, Aug. 12, . 2012, in Chicago.' This disarmed appearance is critical to the cover image, which almost comes off as a sneak attack on the POTUS. At least they had the dignity to remove the gum he was chewing. The . divorce between the president's light demeanor and the damning text . makes the cover - and the image - all the more interesting. Some . might recognize Mrs Kaster as the same photographer who snapped the . image of Barack Obama in Iowa's Bayliss Park last week. Speaking from a podium, he gestured his hands in such a way that he seems to be grasping the sun, or rather, a crystal ball.

"Motorists who think smaller cars guzzle less fuel may want to think again after research revealed that bigger vehicles may actually be cheaper to run. While drivers are often led to believe that smaller cars can travel more miles per gallon (mpg), research by Emission Analytics found that they often use up more fuel because they generally have to work harder to accelerate. As part of the research, the data company - which studies fuel consumption and emissions figures for road vehicles – tested more than 500 cars. Scroll down for video . Research by Emission Analytics, which tested 500 cars in Britain, found that smaller vehicles often use more fuel because they generally have to work harder to accelerate than those with bigger engines (file picture) The study tested fuel economy in 500 vehicles and compared engine size to miles per gallon. It found that small cars (with an engine of one litre or under) had the biggest variance in advertised mpg figures and actual mpg . Researchers chose a range of different models, and a mix of both petrol and diesel vehicles, and drove them for three hours on British roads while studying the amount of fuel they used. They found that all of the cars tested travelled on average 18 per cent fewer miles per gallon than stated in manufacturers' specifications. The data analysts said this was because the vehicles accelerated more and travelled at higher speeds on the road than in official testing regimes. The greatest variance between manufacturers' claims and actual performance was found in vehicles which had an engine of one litre or under. They achieved 36 per cent less than expected in terms of fuel economy, after fuel consumption measured at 38.6mpg – differing significantly from its advertised 60.3mpg. Cars with an engine size of between one and two litres performed at 21 per cent less in fuel economy while engine sizes of between two and three at 15 per cent less. In comparison, vehicles with an engine of five litres or more had just a one per cent variance between its actual mpg and its advertised mpg. The greatest variance between manufacturers' claims of fuel consumption miles per gallon and actual performance was found in vehicles which had an engine of one litre or under, the study found (file picture) An Emission Analytics spokesman said: 'For maximum fuel economy you should look for a one to three litre engine, as these will return around 45-46mpg. 'And, to avoid being too disappointed with the result, pick a two to three litre vehicle as it will be only 15 per cent worse than you were told you could achieve.' The study by Emissions Analytics measured the fuel consumption in varying engine sizes. It tested more than 500 cars on British roads and recorded the true mile per gallon (mpg) of each vehicle (far right). It then compared the true mpg with the manufacturers' claims and calculated the percentage on how the figures differed. Engine size . 0-1 litre . 1-2 litre . 2-3 litre . 3-4 litre . 4-5 litre . 5+ litre . Variance . -36 per cent . -21 per cent . -15 per cent . -14 per cent . -15 per cent . -1 per cent . True MPG . 38.6 . 46.7 . 45 . 35.7 . 25.4 . 23.5 . Nick Molden, Emission Analytics' founder, said the remarkable difference between advertised miles per gallon figures and the actual figures was down to the way vehicles are tested. He said official testing regimes involve lower rates of acceleration and lower speeds than those demonstrated by car owners. He told The Telegraph: 'The problem at the moment is how official tests are leading people to outcomes that are not helping the environment. 'Where people buy engines that are below one litre, you are getting worse fuel economy, therefore you are getting worse CO2 and you may also be getting more nitrogen dioxide, and that's not what is intended by the regulations.' Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said: 'These astonishing figures only fuel the debate on the worth of official mpg data. 'Well over two million new cars will be sold in the UK this year, with small vehicles topping the sales chart. 'But how many drivers will actually get what they think they have paid for? The answer, in terms of fuel efficiency, must be not many.'","Cars with smaller engines may guzzle more fuel than bigger cars, study finds .

"One week before a close election, superstorm Sandy has confounded . the presidential race, halted early voting in many areas and led some to ponder . whether the election might even be postponed. It could take days to restore electricity to more than 8 million . homes and businesses that lost power when the storm pummeled the East Coast . -leading experts to question whether the election can be put back from November . 6th. While the answer is of course yes in theory, the probability of . the choice between Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama being postponed is . unlikely despite the devastating effect superstorm Sandy had on 60 million . people across the north-east, or one-sixth of the population. U.S. President Barack Obama speaks about preparations for Hurricane Sandy during a briefing at the White House . But as the storm left its trail of destruction behind, even some . of those intimately involved in the election seemed in the dark about what . options are available to cope with the storm. Asked Monday whether President Barack Obama had the power to . reschedule the election, White House press secretary Jay Carney said he wasn't . sure. However, constitutionally, the President doesn't set the date for . the election, Congress does. Congress could act within the next week to change the date, but . that would be tough because lawmakers are on recess and back home in their . districts campaigning for re-election. Ground Zero: New Yorkers begin the clean-up after the devastation of Sandy . Plus, it's likely that would mean changing the date for the entire . country, not just those affected by the storm. What's more, Congress only selects the date for federal elections, . so changing the date would wreak havoc for state and local elections also . scheduled for Nov. 6. 'For those states that don't already have an election emergency . process in place, any departure from the established election process could . easily give rise to court challenges about the legitimacy of the election,' said Steven Huefner, professor at Ohio State's Moritz College of Law to ABC . News. 'Even states with an emergency plan might find themselves facing . litigation over specific ways in which they've implemented their emergency . plan.' Some have asked if it is likely for the election to go ahead but . to allow New Jersey and New York to vote at a different time afterwards. That is possible, but the legal issues get tricky. States, by and . large, are in charge of their own elections. U.S. Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney accepts relief supplies for people affected by Hurricane Sandy . Each state has its own laws dealing with what to do if an . emergency jeopardizes voting and who can make the call. Federal law says that if a state fails to conduct an election for . federal races on the day Congress chooses, the state legislature can pick a . later date. Nevertheless, experts told ABC News that even minor contingency . arrangements, like keeping polls open longer in some precincts or moving . polling locations, will probably lead to legal challenges and more provisional . voting, which can delay election results. But state and federal laws don't always jive perfectly. Virginia . Governor Bob McDonnell has said his state's laws don't grant him authority to . reschedule the presidential election. Despite no presidential election ever being postponed, some are . pointing to past precedents where voting has been delayed. New York City was holding its mayoral primary when terrorists struck . on Sept. 11, 2001, and the city rescheduled the election. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Louisiana's governor postponed . municipal elections in New Orleans after elections officials said polling . places wouldn't be ready. However, what is most likley is a compromise for those affected by . the havoc caused by the storm. Voting hours could be extended at various locations and in places . where electronic voting machines are in use, paper ballots could be used . instead. Some areas also might choose to move polling locations if existing . ones are damaged, inaccessible or won't have power on Election Day. But even amending election day to accommodate the affected would . create problems in themselves. If poll hours are extended, under a 2002 law passed by Congress in . response to the disputed 2000 presidential election, any voters who show up . outside of regular hours must use provisional ballots, which are counted later . and could be challenged. Crucial swing states such as Ohio have felt the impact of Sandy and could make all the difference in the election next week . Sandy's impact was felt in some of the most competitive states in . the presidential race, including Virginia and Ohio. The more provisional ballots that are cast, the greater the . chances are that the winner won't be known until days or even weeks after the . election. There's another issue if poll hours are extended in some areas - . such as counties with the worst storm damage - and not in others. That could prompt lawsuits under the Constitution's Equal . Protection Clause, said Edward Foley, an election law expert at The Ohio State . University. Relocating polling places is also risky because it could drive . down turnout, said Neil Malhotra, a political economist at Stanford . University's Graduate School of Business. 'If you disrupt their routine and the . polling place they've always been going to, even if you don't move it very far, . they vote less,' he said. The Federal Emergency Management Agency's administrator, Craig . Fugate, said Monday he anticipated the storm's impact could linger into next . week and affect the election. He said FEMA would look at what support it could . provide to states before the election. 'This will be led by the states,' he . said.","White House still unsure about how the storm will affect next week's election .
The President doesn't set the date for elections, Congress does .
States must decide their own polling strategies in emergencies according to election regulations .
Contingency plans could lead to legal squabbles over final results in some states .

"A mother-of-two has revolutionized the concept of the traditional family photograph with a series of controversial images entitled 'Domestic Bliss'. After spending years as a 'helicopter mother' who hovered around her children taking a constant stream of photos - while never actually featuring in any family images herself - former dancer Susan Copich came up with the idea for the unique photography project, which she felt would allow her to turn the camera on herself for once and 'project some sort of emotional honesty'. 'I needed a creative outlet of my own - one in which I called the shots and controlled everything so no questions or insecurities remained unanswered,' the actress told MailOnline. 'I think it was a call to power on my part! 'I needed a creative outlet': Susan Copich's Domestic Bliss project allowed her to create a series of characters which draw on her own 'dark thoughts' Dark and daring: Many of the images, such as Anger Management (pictured) challenge the traditional perceptions of 'normal' family life . 'Who is the adult?' Susan uses the images to highlight current issues - such as the increasing number of young people who have access to guns, which features clearly in 'Toy' (pictured) 'I loved not having to make myself into someone’s else projection or image, I was able to be exactly as I wanted, for an ex-dancer and actor this was huge.' Each of the images within the Domestic Bliss series has what Susan calls a 'twist of darkness', a daring element that challenges the normal perceptions of family happiness and forces viewers to look beyond the surface of the photo. And more than that, they have given Susan the chance to put herself at the forefront of family life by altering the day-to-day dynamic of her roles as both a mother and a wife. 'I wanted to explore living vicariously through character since my life became about taking care of my daughters and husband and home and as much as I love them I needed to express more,' she said. 'I wanted to feel relevant again and create something honest and courageous. I didn’t want to fall through the cracks of domesticity.' Although she describes her role in each image as a 'character', Susan admits that she drew on her own personal experiences and emotions in order to find inspiration for each one. 'I didn't want to fall through the cracks of domesticity': After spending years taking pictures of her children, Susan wanted to put herself back in the forefront of her family photos . Look again: Each of the images within the Domestic Bliss series has what Susan calls a 'twist of darkness' The 'twist of darkness' is her daring element that challenges the normal perceptions of family happiness . 'I dwell in the dark thoughts and recesses of my mind to create character and subject, in order to project them into a frozen moment of time, allowing the story to continue to unfold bilaterally for the viewer,' Susan writes on her website. 'I feel a certain freedom to live vicariously through these characters to engage, seek to navigate (and, no less, avoid), both my own personal imperatives as woman, artist, mother, and wife, as well as those – personal, social and cultural – that are imposed on me by others.' While many of the images draw on Susan's personal thoughts and feelings, a number also highlight current issues and problems within society. For example, 'Toy' features three young girls playing with a handgun, an image which Susan says is a comment on the ease with which young people are able to access weapons. Back in front: The images give Susan the chance to put herself at the forefront of family life by altering the day-to-day dynamic of her roles as both a mother and a wife . Family fun: Susan features her daughters - aged 12 and 8 - in many of the images, and admits that the girls have 'a back-pocket full of pride' thanks to their mother's work . It's personal: Although she describes her role in each image as a 'character', Susan admits that she drew on her own personal experiences and emotions in order to find inspiration for each one . 'This image is taken directly from the headlines of the newspapers; unsupervised children with access to guns; where are the parents?' she explained. 'The only one who looks concerned or worried is the youngest of the children; looking to her mother or adult figure for reaction or assurance, but clearly not receiving any. Asking who is the adult figure?' Susan features her daughters - aged 12 and 8 - in many of the images, and told the Huffington Post that the girls have 'a back-pocket full of pride' thanks to their mother's work.","Susan Copich, from Columbia County, New York, spent years taking pictures of her family but realized she was missing from almost every photo .

"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has met with US lawmakers in the hope that they can ring-fence his country from Palestinian accusations that it committed war crimes during the recent fighting. Israel has consistently maintained that its military strikes on Gaza, some of which have resulted in civilian deaths, have been in self-defence against rocket attacks from terrorist group Hamas. However, Palestinian officials are thought to be considering joining the International Criminal Court (ICC) in a bid to have Israel investigated. Scroll down for video . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has approached US lawmakers in a bid to avoid war crimes charges. He's pictured here speaking to the media at the defense ministry in Tel Aviv on Saturday . Meeting: Democrat Steve Israel met with Netanyahu to discuss the Gaza conflict and US-Israeli relations . Netanyahu met with a delegation of US politicians – including Democrat Steve Israel - to discuss ways of keeping the spotlight off its actions in Gaza, according to theNew York Post. US-Israeli relations were also on the agenda, the paper reported. Israel said: 'The prime minister asked us to work together to ensure that this strategy of going to the ICC does not succeed.' Netanyahu told a press conference: 'Israel deeply regrets every civilian casualty. We do not target them. The tragedy of Gaza is that it is ruled by Hamas. They want civilian casualties, they use them as PR fodder. 'Indeed, Hamas has adopted a strategy that uses and sacrifices Gaza's civilians. They fire rockets from schools, mosques, urban neighborhoods, right next to schools, right next to where journalists are staying.' He then asked: 'Imagine your territory was infiltrated by death squads. What would you do?' Nick Clegg, Britain's Deputy Prime Minister, said he believed Israel has every right to defend itself from rocket attacks by Hamas – but that its operation had 'overstepped the mark'. He described recent strikes on three UN schools in Gaza as 'outrageous'. Palestinian officials say nearly 1,900 Palestinians have been killed in the month-long fighting, three-quarters of them civilians, according to the United Nations. Israel says some 900 Palestinian militants were among the dead. Sixty-four Israeli soldiers and three civilians in Israel have also been killed. One of the triggers for the current round of Israeli-Hamas confrontations was the abduction and killing of three Israeli teens in the West Bank in June, which Israel blamed on Hamas. Israel subsequently carried out a massive ground operation in the West Bank, arresting hundreds of Hamas operatives as part of a manhunt. And in early July, an Arab teenager was abducted and burned alive by Israeli extremists in an apparent revenge attack. Six Jewish Israelis were arrested in that killing. Also, militants in Gaza unleashed barrages of rocket fire on Israel. Rescue workers search for victims as Palestinians gather around the wreckage of a house, which witnesses said was destroyed in an Israeli air strike that killed at least five people . In a picture taken from the Israel-Gaza border, smoke rises from the coastal side of the Gaza Strip following an Israeli controlled explosion of a tunnel, on August 1 . The war started on July 8, when Israel launched airstrikes that it said were aimed at stopping the rocket fire. The operation - dubbed 'Protective Edge' - was expanded on July 17 when Israel sent in ground forces to destroy a network of tunnels it said were used by militants to stage attacks inside Israel. In details emerging from the fighting, Hamas' military wing said in a statement late Wednesday that 23 of its fighters had been found alive after being trapped for nearly three weeks inside an underground tunnel attacked and sealed in an Israeli strike. The militants had staged attacks against Israelis before they became trapped. They survived on water from an underground spring and dates. Hamas said bulldozers freed them on Wednesday. Meanwhile, an appeal to help hundreds of thousands of people who have fled their homes in Gaza is being launched by the Disasters Emergency Committee. The DEC, which brings together 13 leading UK aid charities in 'times of crisis', said half a million people have been forced from their homes, while up to 1.5 million have no access to water, sanitation or medical care.

"Armed with a 3ft machete, the masked raider who burst into a convenience store at 6am wasn’t expecting much resistance. But he hadn’t bargained on Muhammed Maqsood. As these dramatic CCTV images show, the fearless shopkeeper armed himself with a metal shutter pole and embarked on a duel with the thug. Scroll down for video . The two pictured trading blows, with each ducking and weaving as Mr Maqsood fends off the attack . Mr Maqsood - known as Max - pictured outside the store which he defended with a metal pole. He lost part of his finger in the violent attempted robbery . Despite being hit three times with the machete and losing part of a finger, Mr Maqsood, known as Max, battled valiantly on and eventually sent the raider packing empty-handed. Police released footage of the clash which took place at Max and Sons store in Eden Vale, Sunderland, at 6am last Saturday. Mr Maqsood, 63, who has run his shop for 32 years, said: ‘He was telling me “give me the money, give me the money” and he showed me the big knife, which was 3ft long. “I went to the counter and said to him “cool down” and he followed me. He got me three times, but I used the pole twice and got him once on the shoulder and he ran off empty-handed. ‘It was a shock and I’ve never done anything wrong to anybody.’ Acting Detective Sergeant Nick Lawrence said: ‘The footage is clearly distressing as it shows the man going in armed with the machete and struggling with the shopkeeper. ‘This sort of incident is extremely unusual in the area and I’d like to reassure people we’re doing everything we can to trace the man in the CCTV. 'This is why we’ve released the images – we want people to let us know who this is. Someone out there will know.’ The masked robber bursts into the store wielding a machete and demands money from Muhammed Maqsood . Mr Maqsood decides not to give in to his demands and then grabs a metal pole to defend himself . The two begin duelling as they trade blows back and forth with each other across the store counter .

"Yingying Dou reportedly runs an essay writing company . Academics have criticised universities for accepting international students with low-level English proficiency purely for financial gain. They say it is inevitable the international students - some described as 'functionally illiterate' - try to cheat the system, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. Such concerns were reportedly raised by academics who say they were ignored for fear of revenue loss by the university. This comes after it was revealed that Chinese-born Yingying Dou, 30, had reportedly been running a website called MyMaster which  helps students cheat. Head of the Australian National University's South Asian Program, Dr McComas Taylor, told the Sydney Morning Herald that 'universities have become addicted to revenue streams from international students'. Dr Taylor said there are international students who are being accepted into universities but are 'functionally illiterate'. 'If you let in a student who can't read, write or speak English at a sufficiently high level, it's a very natural consequence that they're going to end up cheating like this,' he said. Ms Dou has denied knowing anything about the website MyMaster website which has now been taken down . The vice-chancellor of a university that was targeted by MyMaster - a company that offers to write students' essays for them - said she was 'not surprised' about the latest cheating revelations. UTS Deputy Vice-Chancellor Professor Shirley Alexander spoke out after a woman was accused of running a business that writes university essays to help Chinese international students in Australia pass their degrees. A Sydney Morning Herald investigation by Amy McNeilage and Lisa Visentin claims after they discovered more than 900 ghostwritten essays. Yingying Dou, 30, allegedly charges up to $1000 for essays written by her  100 employees working from a Chinatown office on George Street in Sydney. It’s claimed that MyMaster has an annual turnover of $160,000 thanks to international students desperate to pass their courses or too lazy to do the work themselves. Professor Alexander told the ABC: 'I'm not as surprised as you might think. In higher-education we've had to up the ante in how students are changing the methods of cheating for some time.’ She said that the news that flyers advertising the MyMaster essay writing service were posted in UTS toilets was not alarming. ‘We find those kinds of things all the time, that's not something that is new,’ she said. ‘When we find them we do take the number and call them and point out how illegal it is but they do appear all the time that's not something new,’ she explained. Students (a stock photo is shown) have reportedly paid up to $1000 for their essays to be written for them . The Sydney Morning Herald reported that a flyer posted at the University of Technology Sydney said: ‘Are you racking your brains on your school work? Do you worry about spending $3000 retaking tuition on the failing subject? Leave your worries to MyMaster and make your study easier!’ Ms Dou has denied knowing anything about the website, which has now been taken down. The company’s Facebook page has also been removed but a holding page shows 605 previously people 'liked' it. She reportedly also runs Yingcredible Tutoring, a page which she has endorsed from her own personal Facebook account. ‘We provide commerce subjects tutoring service to university students to help them pass the course,’ a description on the page reads. Daily Mail Australia has contacted Ms Dou for comment but she has not responded. Most university websites display clear advice about plagiarism. The University of Sydney says that while nobody commences their studies with the intent to plagiarise ‘many people do, for a variety of reasons’. ‘Some students plagiarise because they don’t fully understand what plagiarism is, why it is wrong and how it can be avoided. Others plagiarise, because of time or other pressures,’ a warning on their website reads. Ms Dou also reportedly runs Yingcredible Tutoring, which is another service for students . When handing in work students must satisfy the notion that it is ‘all your own work’. Students who have used the MyMaster website could be found guilty of ‘dishonest plagiarism’, which is when they ‘knowingly presenting another person’s work as one’s own work without appropriate acknowledgement of the source’. And ‘engage another person to produce or conduct research for the work, including for payment or other consideration’. A spokesperson for the University of Sydney told Daily Mail Australia: 'The University of Sydney is unequivocally opposed to academic dishonesty, including plagiarism and fraudulent authorship, and takes seriously any allegations of academic misconduct. Breaches of academic honesty are not tolerated at the University of Sydney.' 'Failure to adhere to the University’s high standards of academic merit, intellectual rigour, and ethical behaviour constitutes a breach of the University’s Code of Conduct for Students and Academic Dishonesty and Plagiarism in Coursework Policy. If proven, academic dishonesty may constitute misconduct, resulting in serious penalties that may include failure or exclusion. 'The University thoroughly investigates all cases of alleged academic dishonesty and provides education and support to assist students to observe the rules of honest scholarship,' they added.","Some academics claim they raised concerns over 'functionally illiterate' international students .

"A woman who wanted tattoos of ladybirds on her hand was left with markings that looked like devils after bungled work by a rogue artist, a court heard. Fiona Hall unwittingly visited an unregistered tattoo artist and asked for the insects, which were meant to represent a miscarriage and her daughter. But she was left with inkings that looked like the devil and underwent a series of health checks for tests including HIV and hepatitis. Pictured are the tattoos on Fiona Hall's hand she says look more like devils than ladybirds . Frank Lumley, 58, pleaded guilty to carrying out unlicensed work at South Tyneside Magistrates Court. Ms Hall expressed her anger at the markings following the conclusion of the court hearing. She said: 'I went through a lot of pain with this and had to have a three-month sex ban and HIV and hepatitis blood tests. He went far too deep into my hand and just made a complete mess. 'The ladybirds were meant to represent my daughter and a miscarriage I had, which the person who did my hand knew. 'I have been told they resemble devil heads when they were meant to be ladybirds. I wish I had never gone into that tattoo shop that day. I was basically conned into thinking he was a registered tattooist. 'He did a bad job and I paid the price. He's got to pay me compensation now so I'm just happy he won't be messing up anybody else's body. 'I had a lot of pain and worry in case he had given me a disease and had to wait three months for results on that, and I have a five-year-old to think about. 'I'm just glad it's all over now and can think about what I am going to do to fix my hand as I am self-conscious enough with it looking like I had deliberately got bad tattoos.' The ladybirds were meant to represent Ms Hall's daughter and a miscarriage she had. Here they are pictured soon after they were tattooed onto her hand . As well as the £760 in compensation, which will cover the cost of laser surgery, Lumley was also ordered to pay £100 in court fees. Lumley did not appear in court, but in a letter he apologised for his actions and expressed 'deep regret'. The owner of Studio 4, where she received the tattoo, told the council's licensing section he had asked Lumley if he was registered with the local authority - and had received an assurance that he was. Speaking after the case, Lumley added: 'I just want to say that Studio 4 is a respectable, well-established business and the owner had absolutely nothing to do with this. 'It was me who pulled the wool over his eyes.' Debbie Lloyd, prosecuting on behalf of South Tyneside Council, said: 'On May 18 this year Fiona Hall made an inquiry to the councils licensing service, asking if Frank Lumley was registered with the council to carry out tattooing. 'Miss Hall had attended Studio 4 at Stanhope Road, South Shields, to have a tattoo and made a complaint with regard to the quality of the tattoo. 'Council records found that Mr Lumley was not registered with the local authority to carry out the business of tattooing. 'Mr Lumley was interviewed by Jeff Young of licensing services and admitted taking £20 from Miss Hall to tattoo ladybirds on her hands.' The owner of Studio 4 (pictured), where Ms Hall received the tattoo, said he had received an assurance from Lumley that he was registered with the local authority. Lumley no longer works at the tattoo studio . In a letter to the court, Mr Lumley said: 'I apologise for my stupidity and I deeply regret what I have done and I will never do anything like this again. 'I am a 58-year-old man who suffers from depression and I am sorry to all concerned.' Council officials have urged anyone with information about 'scratchers' - illegal tattooists - to come forward. The appeal comes as part of a drive to maintain cleanliness and hygiene standards to ensure the control of infections such as HIV and hepatitis B and C. A council spokesman said: 'It is illegal for anybody to tattoo a member of the public without a certificate of registration. 'This case highlights the consequences of using an unregistered tattoo artist.'","Fiona Hall asked for tattoos to represent a miscarriage and her daughter .

"Melbourne motorists have been urged to stay away from the Monash Freeway this afternoon after it was closed earlier following a major chemical spill. The Country Fire Authority (CFA) reports that a specialist hazardous materials team has controlled the spill from a drum of highly flammable aviation fuel, which occurred just before 11am. 200 litres of the fuel was being transported in a truck also carrying other highly dangerous chemicals - however authorities say the heavy mover did not crash or roll over. The bank-up of traffic on the Monash Freeway in Melbourne  after a truck carrying highly flammable liquid began leaking earlier today . 'Firefighters in fully enclosed gas suits worked successfully for several hours to prevent the chemicals mixing or igniting,' said the CFA. All inbound and outbound lanes were expected to be open by the peak hour period. Earlier, CFA crews had issued urgent advice, which requested that residents turn off all air-conditioning units. Fire authorities urged residents in the area to stay inside and switch off air conditioners while the clean up of the aviation fuel took place . Operations Officer Greg Christison that a passer-by had alerted the truck driver to the chemical leak who then pulled over and contacted emergency services about the problem.

"The latest specialist equipment from the Gemini Observatory in Chile has used infrared imaging to capture striking images of the Swan Nebula situated around 6,000 light years from Earth. The second-generation FLAMINGOS-2 camera has also snapped unique high-resolution images from the heart of a spiral galaxy as well as a ring of star formation. FLAMINGOS-2 is spectroscopic, which means it has been designed to specifically study and record matter and radiation energy in space. Scroll down for video . This FLAMINGOS-2 image shows part of the Swan Nebula, called M17, situated around 5,200 light years from Earth. It shows ultraviolet radiation streaming from young hot stars that forms a region of dust and gas. M17 is found in the constellation Sagittarius and is one of the biggest star-forming region's in the local galaxy . The Gemini Observatory is an astronomical observatory made up of two 8.19-metre telescopes at sites in Hawaii and Chile. Together, the twin telescopes provide almost complete coverage of both the northern and southern skies. One telescope, called Gemini North, is located on Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano. This location was picked because it has a stable, dry, and rarely cloudy atmosphere above the 4,200-metre-high dormant volcano. The other telescope, Gemini South, is located at around 2,700 metres high on a mountain in the Chilean Andes called Cerro Pachon. There are only two small regions neither telescope can capture near the celestial poles: Gemini North cannot point north of declination +89 degrees which Gemini South can't point south of -89 degrees. After significant redesign and . rebuilds on the Gemini South telescope, . FLAMINGOS-2 is taking images as part of various commissioning phases with the hope it will be sent onto missions exploring the most distant and energetic explosions in our universe. The instrument includes an extreme sensitivity to infrared (heat) radiation from the . universe, high-resolution wide-field imaging and a combination of . spectroscopic capabilities. FLAMINGOS-2 is the second-generation infrared instrument to be built by the team at the Gemini South observatory. The first, called FLAMINGOS I, suffered damage to its . lens when it cracked during a planned final commissioning . in early 2012. This was caused by temperature changes that occurred as the area around the lens switched masks in order to capture multiple spectroscopic images. The second-generation instrument has had design modifications that significantly reduces the risk of these temperature changes to the lens's integrity and functionality. FLAMINGOS-2 will continue to be tested and will carry out more commissioning phases before being made available to astronomers later this year. The heart of spiral galaxy NGC 253, pictured, which lies about 11.5 million light years from Earth. The FLAMINGOS-2 instrument captured this whirlpool of dust spiralling into a nuclear region, where star formation is thought to be occurring around a supermassive black hole . 'It's already one of our most requested instruments at the Gemini telescopes,' said Nancy Levenson, Gemini's Deputy Director and Head of Science. 'We see a long and productive life ahead for FLAMINGOS-2 once astronomers really start using it later this year.' 'It has not been an easy journey,' added Percy Gomez Gemini's FLAMINGOS-2 Instrument Scientist, but thanks to the dedicated work of Gemini engineers and scientists very soon astronomers will be able to use a reliable and robust instrument.' Work still remains on some of the instrument's spectroscopic features, as well as refining imaging at the edge of its large field of view. Kevin Stevenson of the University of Chicago already has plans to use FLAMINGOS-2 later this year to study the exoplanet WASP-18b. This exoplanet is being . strongly heated by its ultra-nearby host star and according to . Stevenson, 'it's even hotter than some of the coolest, low-mass stars . known.' Stevenson and his team hope to . determine the abundances of water vapor and methane when the planet is . eclipsed by its host star. NGC 6300, pictured, is a spiral galaxy in the constellation of Ara. This image, taken by FLAMINGOS-2, shows the galaxy's arm structure forming a ring of star formation. The galaxy's bar also has a vein of dust that almost obscures its bright nucleus in the centre . 'Our plan is to compare the system's light immediately before and during an eclipse to measure the contribution from the planet. 'When we do this over several parts of the infrared part of the light spectrum, we can piece together the planet's spectrum and learn about its temperature and composition.' Once the instrument has finished testing an adaptive optics (AO) feed for extremely high-resolution imaging from GeMS (Gemini Multi-conjugate adaptive optics System) may be added. This technology is capable of removing atmospheric distortion - or blurriness - when taking pictures of space, making images much clearer. It is expected that this system will be fully integrated in 2014 with imaging and long-slit spectroscopy available now. The next round of observations with FLAMINGOS-2 are set to begin on 1st September. FLAMINGOS-2's latest commissioning phase captured this image of spiral galaxy NGC 7582. It is the brightest member of the Grus Quartet of galaxies, situated around 60 million light years away. Plans are to make the instrument available to astronomers later this year .","High-definition images of galaxies captured by FLAMINGOS-2 instrument .

"England fans travelling to next summer's World Cup in Brazil have been warned to protect themselves against a terrifying holiday bug which can kill. Organisers FIFA and their sponsors are being urged to spell out the risks of mosquito-borne dengue fever after a study showed cases could peak in three of the twelve host cities. It usually produces flu-like symptoms but severe forms cause internal bleeding - claiming 20,000 lives every year. Warning: England fans travelling to next summer's World Cup in Brazil have been warned to protect themselves against a terrifying holiday bug which can kill . Dengue is endemic in over 100 countries with 100 million people struck down annually. Professor Simon Hay, an infectious diseases expert, has called on the Brazilian authorities to take action to reduce the number of mosquitoes before over half a million people flock in from across the globe. He said: 'Dengue fever could be a significant problem in some of the tournament locations and preventative measures are needed. 'FIFA, the Brazilian authorities and the World Cup sponsors must use their influence and experience to communicate the risk.' Top of the World: England sealed their place in Brazil last month but now fans are being warned about mosquito-borne dengue fever . Although it cannot be passed from human to human a non-infected insect that bites someone with dengue then becomes a carrier - passing the disease to the next person it targets. It's transmitted by urban, day-biting Aedes mosquitoes which makes it a particular problem in towns and cities. Infected visitors can also inadvertently bring home the disease to their native country. Professor Hay and colleagues explored the risk to football fans by examining maps of the distribution of dengue in Brazil and records of its seasonal variation at key sites. Dengue is a viral infection that can cause a range of symptoms, from mild flu-like illness to more serious illnesses including rashes and bone pain. Severe and potentially deadly forms develop in around 5 percent of patients. Dengue usually clears up by itself within around 1-2 weeks. There are no specific medications to treat the disease, but symptoms can be managed by taking paracetamol, drinking plenty of fluids and resting. The study published in Nature showed outbreaks will be highest when matches are played in Fortaleza, Natal and Salvador - all in the north east of the country. England will find out where they will initially be based when the draw for the group stages takes place on 6 December. Professor Hay, of Oxford University, said: 'I don't want to dissuade anyone from going to the World Cup - nor to single out Brazil - which is one of more than 100 countries battling dengue worldwide. 'My aim is to inform unwary spectators about the risk and how they can protect themselves.' Despite being a tropical disease cases have been reported in France and Croatia. After it struck the island of Madeira last year the World Health Organisation warned of a future European outbreak. There is no vaccine so people heading out next summer should pack plenty of light-coloured long trousers and long-sleeved shirts along with mosquito-repellant sprays for exposed areas of skin. There is no vaccine so people heading out next summer should pack plenty of light-coloured long trousers and long-sleeved shirts along with mosquito-repellant sprays for exposed areas of skin . Professor Hay said: 'The Brazilian authorities should implement aggressive vector control in April and May - particularly around the northern stadiums - to decrease the number of dengue-transmitting mosquitoes. 'They can target adult Aedes mosquitoes through fogging - the use of aerosol formulations of insecticides that disperse efficiently - and can interrupt breeding by clearing sites at which the mosquitoes lay their eggs - water collected in discarded rubbish for example. 'There are no vaccines or drugs against dengue but an individual will never contract dengue if they do not get bitten by an infected mosquito in the first place. So avoiding mosquito bites is the best precaution. 'Select accomodation with screened windows and doors and air conditioning; use insecticides indoors; wear clothing that covers the arms and legs especially during early morning and late afternoon when the chance of being bitten is greatest; and apply insect repellant to clothing and exposed skin.' England fans have already snapped up more than 28,000 match tickets for Brazil - even before they know where the team will be playing. So keen are they to witness glory in June and July they are only behind the host country themselves, the US and Germany in the global rush - despite basic travel packages costing a whopping £7,000.

"A Home Office whistleblower today repeated his claims the government department  funded the notorious Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE) on the orders of the police. Former civil servant Tim Hulbert said money was transferred to the organisation on the orders of the Metropolitan Police's Special Branch. Mr Hulbert worked in the Voluntary Services Unit of the Home Office which approved grants to various outside organisations in the late 1970s and early 80s. He said he went to his manager after seeing that funding was being given to PIE - the  lobby group formed in the 1970s to campaign for a reduction in the age of consent - but his concerns were shrugged off. Former Home Office employee Tim Hulbert said the department provided funding to the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE), on the orders of the Metropolitan Police's Special Branch . The retired government worker told Radio 4's Today programme: 'Every quarter, the list of current grants that were up for consideration for financial support would be circulated through the office and I believe that I saw a copy of that which referred to the re-funding of PIE. 'It was an organisation that was campaigning for the reduction of the age of consent to four. I thought that was inappropriate and outrageous and for a government department to be funding it, I thought was wrong. 'I went to see my boss and he told me, firstly, that PIE was a legitimate campaigning organisation and it did have significant links to the National Council for Civil Liberties and other organisations that were recognised. 'Secondly, I was told that it was being funded a the request of Special Branch.' His claims come the day after a report by NSPCC boss Peter Wanless and Richard Whittam QC, which found it was impossible to say if 114 files linked to alleged Westminster child abusers had been destroyed as part of a cover up. Home Secretary Theresa May said of the findings: ‘It doesn’t prove or disprove the Home Office acted appropriately in the 1980s.’ She added: ‘There might have been a cover-up.' The report failed to rule out Mr Hulbert's claims that the Home Office directly awarded tens of thousands of pounds of public money to the PIE, noting that record keeping at the department was in disarray. The comments came after an investigation into 114 missing files on an alleged Westminster child abuse ring by NSPCC boss Peter Wanless (left). Theresa May (right) said of the report: ‘There might have been a cover-up' Mr Hulbert's comments followed claims by an investigative journalist that Home Office papers he saw - which suggested an investigation into the alleged child abuse ring was later carried out - were seized by Special Branch. Don Hale yesterday revealed he was given a bundle of documents which included the identities of senior politicians who were actively promoting the Paedophile Information Exchange by the late Labour minister Baroness Castle. He said police later arrived at his newspaper office, pushed him against a wall and demanded to take possession of the dossier. His claims are now being investigated by the Metropolitan Police. The Home Secretary said of his claims: 'I recognise the allegations [Mr Hale] has made so my office has been in discussions with the Metropolitan Police today and the Metropolitan Police have agreed they will now look into those allegations that have been made.'","Former government employee says he saw evidence PIE was given grant .

"UKIP MEP Trevor Colman has defended claiming tens of thousands of pounds in allowances while barely speaking in Brussels . A UKIP MEP has admitted one of the only reasons he turns up in Brussels is to claim £200,000 in allowances. Trevor Colman has not done anything in the European Parliament in the last year, and has only taken part in half of votes since 2009. The South West MEP insisted he could not see the point in making speeches in the Parliament, and instead claimed the taxpayers’ money to fund an anti-EU website. All MEPs receive a salary of £78,000 but must ‘clock in’ to the Parliament building in order to receive various allowances. However, Mr Colman has only made speeches or asked questions just 19 times, well behind the average of the five other MEPs in the South West. Asked whether allowances were a factor influencing his decision, Mr Colman: ‘I wouldn’t say getting the allowances is one of the main motivations, I’m trying to be fair about it, it is a factor, of course it is.’ He was confronted about his expenses during an interview on BBC’s Sunday Politics West show. Mr Colman said: ‘Why make a speech when you know that it is totally ineffective? That you are there talking to a gallery of about six people, I don’t quite see the point of me doing that. ‘It’s not that I’m not doing anything, I am trying to get us out of this mess and that can only be achieved over here.’ Last year a study found that cosseted MEPs now have incomes up to 20 times higher than the people they represent. While millions of families across Europe have had their incomes squeezed, most MEPs have enjoyed large increases in their salaries – while continuing to vote through ever-higher budgets for the EU. The study found that MEPs enjoy an average income of £182,826, including allowances for attendance and travel. Mr Colman said there was no point in giving a speech to the European Parliament which was often all but emtpy . Mr Colman admitted turning up at the European Parliament to ensure he receives his huge allowances, most of which he spends on a website aimed at removing the UK from the European Union. He added: ‘The European Parliament has no power, it can’t make or change legislation, it has little or no power, we are in fact just a pantomime taking players to make the illusion of giving democracy where none exists. The BBC found Mr Colman – who is standing down in May - employs five full time staff, who mainly work on the website, another woman who covers Brussels and Strasbourg, and a part time employee. Graham Watson, a Lib Dem MEP, said: ‘There is a massive amount that goes on in the European parliament and that’s why most of the members are there full-time doing their jobs, . ‘I’m sorry if Trevor Colman finds it so boring, but I would have to ask the question why did he stand in the first place.’ However UKIP chairman Steve Crowther defended Mr Colman’s conduct. ‘We have a specific job to do and we are elected to do it, that is to campaign and work for Britain to come out of the European Parliament,’ he said. Mr Colman is no stranger to criticism of his behaviour as an MEP - and has been blasted for wasting taxpayers' money before. The UKIP member, who stood unsuccessfully in 2004 but won a seat in 2009, said last year that he goes to Brussels just twice a month, for 'about three days'. He told the Journal of European . Integration: 'If I don't come and put my card in the slot to vote, I . don't get my money to give to the party.' While in December 2010 an investigation by the Sunday Telegraph ranked him in the bottom half of UK MEPS. It calculated that he cost taxpayers £156,415 per year, attended around 83 per cent of parliamentary sessions, and made just 12 speeches, questions or motions. The figures would seem to suggest that his activity dropped dramatically after he had spent more than a year as an MEP. He was also criticised by a 2009 report designed to expose MEPs who voted against making Brussels more transparent. He was given the fourth-worst ranking in this category. Before being elected, Mr Colman had served in Devon & Cornwall police, rising to the rank of superintendent. He left the force in 1995, and then spent four years advising the ITV detective series Wycliffe.","Trevor Colman admits allowances is a 'factor' for clocking into Parliament .

"David Coulthard has urged McLaren to retain Jenson Button with the British driver’s Formula One future hanging in limbo. McLaren will discuss their line-up for next season at a board meeting on Thursday and it is likely that Button will make way for Fernando Alonso who re-joins the team from Ferrari. The Spaniard is set to be partnered with the more affordable Kevin Magnussen, who managed less than half of Button’s points tally this season, or the team’s even younger protege Stoffel Vandoorne. Jenson Button speaks to Red Bull driver Daniel Ricciardo before the final race of the season in Abu Dhabi, with the Brit's Formula One future hanging in the balance following the arrival of Fernando Alonso at McLaren . Button tours the circuit with Alonso following in the background during the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix . ‘If you just look at results then Jenson is the guy who should be in that seat next year’, said Coulthard, who spent nine seasons with McLaren. ‘He has outperformed and outscored his team-mate and that has nothing to do with personality or his nationality. But unfortunately for Jenson, the business of Formula One is what funds the sport so he may well be a casualty.’ Alonso’s move back to the team he left so acrimoniously in 2007 is expected to net him £25million-a-year. Button currently earns about £13m against Magnussen’s £500,000. ‘I don’t know this for a fact, but there are all sorts of behind-the-scenes shareholding wrangling which is all about funding,’ added Coulthard. Alonso has rejoined McLaren for the 2015 season and is likely to be partnered by Kevin Magnussen, Button or rookie Stoffel Vandoorne . Fans have urged McLaren to keep hold of Button with the Brit having outperformed Magnussen in 2014 . David Coulthard has called on McLaren to retain Button for the 2015 season . Coulthard is offering the once in a lifetime experience to race around the Mercedes World Tour Track. For more information and to bid head to www.charitystars.com . ‘I believe some of the partners already involved with McLaren are Danish companies so they are going to be supportive of Kevin. ‘He is a nice lad and has a bright future ahead of him, but Jenson has got a lot of public support. He is a well-known, recognisable, likeable face, an asset to Formula One and to McLaren.’ Button will end a 15-year career if he is not retained by McLaren, and the Briton has already explored options outside of the sport, most notably the World Endurance Championship. But McLaren’s failure to determine his future before the season finale and thus depriving Button, the 2009 world champion, an opportunity of a public farewell in Abu Dhabi, has attracted widespread criticism. ‘McLaren are in a public sport and the heroes of the sport are the drivers,’ said Coulthard, a 13-time race winner. ‘They are still the ones that get the public support because they humanise the raw dream of being able to drive a grand prix car. With that in mind I can’t help but think it hasn’t been McLaren’s best year of PR. ‘The occasion of life and sport is that it is not like Jenson can come back in Melbourne and blow everyone a kiss. We have all moved on. ‘It would be easy to drop a one liner and say it is not right, but if you are a rational individual then you have to look at the bigger picture. ‘Did he deserve to be treated with a little bit more respect given his time in the sport? Yes, I certainly think that is a valid argument.’ Social enterprise and charity auction platform, CharityStars, officially launches in the UK with a once in a lifetime experience to race around the Mercedes World Track with David Coulthard in a Mercedes SLS-AMG.

"A schoolteacher who narrowly avoided a prison sentence for seducing one of her pupils has told a court she is 'fully co-operating' with social workers after her 'ten days of madness'. Married Bernadette Smith, 35, escaped a jail sentence after she was convicted of kissing and cuddling 16-year-old schoolboy Gary Ralston at his home in Cowie, Stirlingshire, and at a park in Falkirk. The mother of three, who was sacked from her position at Bannockburn High School in Stirling over the incident, said she kept a tiny vest top on and did not have sex with the boy when she stayed over at his house in September last year. Married Bernadette Smith, 35, (pictured outside court left) escaped a jail sentence after she was convicted of kissing and cuddling 16-year-old Gary Ralston (right) at his home in Stirlingshire and at a park in Falkirk . At a review hearing at Stirling Sheriff Court today, Smith (pictured outside with friends) was said to be 'fully co-operating' with the case management process and was told she wasn't required to attend court again . She admitted her wrongdoing in February and was sentenced to a two-year supervision order and ordered to sign the sex offenders' register. Today, she appeared at Stirling Sheriff Court, for a community payback order review, and told the judge she was putting her life back in order after the scandal. The court was given a report prepared by officials responsible for her supervision and her lawyer, Alistair Milne, said she was fully co-operating. He said: 'The report is, in my submission, fully favourable, and there is a clear recommendation to allow the order to run its course. 'There has been a full level of co-operation on her part.' Smith, of Denny, Stirlingshire, who appeared in the dock today wearing a black and grey skirt, a black top and high-heeled ankle boots, avoided jail in February after Sheriff Robertson told her that her conduct was at the lesser end of the scale for the type of sex offence with which she was charged. At the time, the court heard how she told police and colleagues that she was 'in love' with Gary, who she had taught and also given after-school tuition. The affair started in Smith's classroom when she confessed her feelings to 16-year-old Gary and the pair later went to the park and kissed. That night, she went to his house and stayed over but did not have sex with him . The 16-year-old schoolboy (pictured in his bedroom) later said Smith was his favourite teacher and that he 'couldn't believe she was with me'. He said 'a lot of the boys fancied her' and said: 'She did me no harm' The court had heard how the affair started in Smith's classroom where she confessed her feelings to the boy, who has since waived his anonymity, before the pair went to a park and had their first kiss. That night, Smith visited the house Gary shared with his father, Richard, and she and the schoolboy spent the night together in Gary's bed. The pair were caught after Gary's grandmother found out and told the school, which suspended Smith immediately. At the time, Gary's father admitted to being ‘a bit’ proud of his son for catching the teacher’s eye. Prosecutor Ann Orr said: 'She admitted she met him on two occasions outside school and kissed him on the mouth and neck. 'She also admitted meeting at his home and told his father about her feelings and she stayed overnight in the boy's bedroom and that she had been wearing her jeans and a bra. 'She said during the interview that she loved the boy and they both wanted to be together.' Smith had claimed in court that her behaviour was sparked over her husband Brian's continued deceit over an affair. The English and history teacher claimed she started her affair after trying to be a ‘positive influence’ on Gary and said it evolved after she poured her heart out to him about her problems at home. Sentencing her, Sheriff Robertson told her: 'Some of course may say that had it not been detected it could have led to more serious activity towards the other end of the scale, but that is speculation. 'You have lost your reputation, your job and your career, and your marriage is at an end. 'You have caused distress to your immediate family, and with the media attention that this case has attracted, I suspect that your humiliation is complete.' Smith, 35, blamed her husband Brian's (together above) continued deceit as the reason for her behaviour . Gary's father (above) admitted to being ‘a bit’ proud of his son for catching the attractive teacher’s eye (right) In light of the incident, Smith was struck off by General Teaching Council for Scotland. After pleading guilty, Gary said Smith was always his favourite teacher and added: 'A lot of the boys fancied her. I couldn't believe she was with me. 'It was the last thing I expected. She said she thought she was going crazy but couldn't help the way she was feeling. 'She did me no harm and I'm fine. 'Looking back, I wish it hadn't happened. It was exciting but it wasn't worth it - not for her anyway.' During today's review hearing, Sheriff Wyllie Robertson said the order could now continue without any further court appearances. He told Smith: 'The purpose of this review was to ensure that there has been full and complete engagement with the order and I'm reassured in the terms of the report that you are participating fully in the case management process. 'I will allow the order to continue without any further review.' Smith was sacked from her position at Bannockburn High School in Stirling (pictured) over the incident .","Bernadette Smith, 35, kissed and cuddled Gary Ralson, 16, at his home .

"Stoke goalkeeper Asmir Begovic has revealed he wants to sign for Liverpool. Begovic claimed in an interview in his native Bosnia that he would be moving to Anfield in July for pre-season training. The 25-year-old said: 'I want to start preparing on July 10, with all the players of Liverpool.' Anfield move? Asmir Begovic has claimed he wants to begin pre-season training with Liverpool in July . Stoke, who have already signed England keeper Jack Butland from Birmingham, are weighing up a move for FC Twente stopper Timo Plattel as they prepare for Begovic's departure. Plattel, 19, would be seen as competition for Butland, who agreed to this summer's move in January, if a deal was concluded. Begovic has been linked with a move to a number of Premier League rivals, including Manchester United, but with reports of Barcelona's interest in Pepe Reina, Begovic clearly believes he is on his way to Anfield. The Bosnian, who was pictured this . week taking in a NBA match in America, said earlier this month: ‘We . haven’t spoken at all yet, but I think we will sit down this week and . formulate plans from there. ‘All . the speculation is flattering and nice, but as long as Stoke want me, I . am contracted here. I am happy here and desperate to help the club push . forward, as long as they are moving in the right direction. ‘I have ambition to play at the highest level and test myself at that standard, if the opportunity arises.’ Feeling the Heat: Begovic (centre) was spotted in the crowd at a Miami Heat basketball match this week . 20-20 vision: FC Twente's 19-year-old goalkeeper Timo Plattel (far left) sits on the bench during the Eredivisie Europa League Playoff  match between Twente and Utrecht last night .
