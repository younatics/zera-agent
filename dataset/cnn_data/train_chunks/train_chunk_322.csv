"(CNN) -- Ireland's strict anti-abortion laws are under fire after an Indian woman living there died after being refused an abortion last month. Savita Halappanavar, 31, went into a hospital on October 21, complaining of back pain. She was 17 weeks pregnant at the time. The doctors who examined her told her she was having a miscarriage but denied her an abortion even though she was in extreme pain, her husband has said. Halappanavar died at the hospital, leading lawmakers to call for an investigation into what role abortion laws may have played in her death. ""They knew they couldn't help the baby. Why did they not look at the bigger life?"" her husband, Praveen Halappanavar, told the Irish Times. Halappanavar was told that the miscarriage would be over in a matter of hours, said Kitty Holland, who reported the story for the Irish Times. But the hours kept ticking and Halappanavar remained in terrible pain, so her husband asked doctors to expedite the miscarriage by carrying out an abortion. Doctors at Galway University Hospital said that as long as the fetal heartbeat could be felt, the law prevented them from ending the pregnancy, Holland said. Halappanavar died of septicemia, or a blood infection, after three days in the hospital. ""Tuesday morning, came back and said, 'Sorry, can't help you. It's a Catholic country. Can't help you. It's a Catholic team.' So, Savita said that she was not a Catholic. She is Hindu, so why impose the law of the land on her?"" her husband said. The death led to protests, and top Irish lawmakers are asking whether the law needs to be changed. In Ireland, abortion is legal if the mother's life is at risk, which is different from her health being at risk, Holland said. The hospital expressed sympathy to Halappanavar's husband, but noted in a statement that ""the facts of this tragic case have yet to be established."" The hospital is conducting a review of the incident, as it does will all unexpected deaths. The Galway Roscommon University Hospitals Group released a statement saying, ""In the case of a sudden maternal death, these procedures are followed: notification of the death to the coroner; notification of the death to the HSE's National Incident Management Team; the completion of a maternal death notification form. These national procedures are being followed by Galway University Hospital."" Halappanavar's death is ""particularly tragic and harrowing, and shocking to all concerned,"" Irish opposition lawmaker Micheal Martin said before parliament. He called for an independent inquiry into the case ""with personnel from outside the country to participate on such a panel of inquiry."" The Irish government needs to ""establish the full circumstances"" of her death, he said. The Irish head of state, Taoiseach Enda Kenny, said two investigations are under way. Gerry Adams, leader of Ireland's Sinn Fein political party, said it's time for the government to legislate for abortion in certain medical cases. The incident is garnering attention outside of Ireland, too. In neighboring Northern Ireland, a lawmaker called for a review of abortion laws there, as well. ""An abortion to save the life of the mother is legal here, but the lack of clear guidelines has created such uncertainties and confusion amongst medical staff that such an occurrence could happen again,"" Anna Lo said. In London, an abortion rights demonstration took place Wednesday evening outside the Irish Embassy. Who calls the shots on abortion laws?

"(CNN) -- We're all thirsty and we don't even know it. But an Estonian start-up called Jomi Interactive aims to solve this problem. Although they're only in a developmental stage right now (Read: Give us your money!), the company managed to turn more than a few heads online this week when prototypes of their new products were featured on TechCrunch and several other websites. The product is a Jomi band (or sleeve). You attach it around your water bottle and it monitors your fluid intake, reminding you, with sounds and LED indicators, that, perhaps, its time to drink more water. Or, if you've filled your Nalgene with vodka, then perhaps it's time to stroll through the hallway naked, stealing office supplies. ""Dude, that's my highlighter."" Naturally, the band will also sync up to your mobile device via Bluetooth so you can check your hydration stats. Presumably while you urinate for the next 30 minutes. What you might actually do with this water-consumption info is sort of a mystery, but I suppose sharing it with friends is no less ridiculous than pontificating over your fantasy football results. In fact, I'd rather hear all about your fluid intake far more than how many fake points Tom Brady scored in your Week 3 win over the A-Town Booger Heads. Hopefully, unlike those super-fantasy nerds, Jomi fanatics will eventually give it a rest. Because the start-up claims their crusade is ""to make sure we never forget it."" ""It"" being to drink water. That, or the Alamo. So, it'll be interesting to see if this product eventually takes off. Especially since at least one similar product already exists in the market -- the HydraCoach. (Now with the special Rutgers Edition! When it's time to drink, HydraCoach will call you a homophobic slur and launch basketballs at your head! Operators are standing by!) Sadly, however, despite all these innovative devices, and despite the fact that water is so important to our health, I don't think I'll ever actually give up on Diet Coke. I'm in the cult. And I'm in it real bad. But not THAT bad. You see, the day you start selling black market copper wire to pay for Diet Coke is the day you realize you have a serious problem. And when you then find yourself missing your kid's T-ball game to slug down 20-ouncers under a bridge with actual addicts, that's when it's time to officially re-evaluate your life. ""Hey, man, beat it! This place is for serious drugs!"" Fortunately, for me, it never came to that. But there was certainly a semi-dangerous period in life where my body's entire liquid intake consisted only of Diet Coke. And I say that without a hint of hyperbole. On a normal day I would drink three or four cans at work and then come home to literally chug out of a 2-liter bottle from the fridge. I'm very classy. Chicks dig me. But they don't dig me nearly as much as my dog, Mikey, who would anxiously stare up into my eyes as I power-blasted ""daddy's medicine."" Mikey stared partly because I think he was amazed at what a disgusting, chemically infused human pig I had become. But he also stared because he was (and is) always a grateful recipient of the empty plastic bottle. Which, for a dog, is basically like getting a new Nintendo 64 every single day. You know, back when that was actually a relevant analogy. Of course, despite the 100% scientific fact that Diet Coke is made from the tears of angels and unicorns, and carbonated by the gentle vibrations of Art Garfunkel's voice, I believe -- though, some research doesn't necessarily agree -- that a major negative side effect of this addiction is chronic dehydration. It's fluid. But it's not water. Either way, it probably wasn't a smart way to live, and I was always parched. So I've worked out some rules to help ease me back into healthy hydration. Mind you, they're terrible rules, and I routinely bend them to achieve a far more important goal. Namely, to drink more Diet Coke. I'm enjoying one right now. Loopholes. They're everywhere! The basic idea is that I can only have Diet Coke on the weekends and days off from work. However, business travel counts as a weekend. And, if Diet Coke is provided free as part of a work lunch or company event, that also negates the not-at-the-office rule. Additionally, Friday at 12:00:01 a.m. is when weekends officially start. And if I'm going on vacation, the last actual day of work that week counts as a Friday. Other exceptions include national holidays, important televised soccer matches (including pre- and post-game analysis), and whenever somebody says the secret magic word. Today it's ""Synergy."" So, if you're a betting man, the smart money is on another Diet Coke! I also have a good feeling about the A-Town Booger Heads.","Jomi Interactive hopes their prototype band will encourage people to drink more water .

"(CNN) -- It's not surprising there's speculation that Michelle Obama might run for the United States Senate â€” although one should note that at this point, that's all it is: speculation â€” made mainly in a Reuters article written by Keith Koffler, editor of the website White House Dossier. The fact is, however, Michelle Obama is a highly effective and popular public figure and would make a gifted elected leader. We should remember that before Barack Obama's presidency, Michelle Obama was perhaps even more of a superstar than her husband. An accomplished attorney, she was an assistant to the mayor of Chicago in the early 1990s, as well as an assistant commissioner of planning and development for the city. After running the Chicago branch of the nonprofit Public Allies, which gets young people engaged in nonprofit and government leadership, Obama moved to the University of Chicago, eventually rising to be vice president of the university's extensive hospitals network. In our unequal country where so many people are vastly and unfairly underpaid, income certainly isn't an accurate measure of talent. But it certainly is often a good measure of power. In 2006, Sen. Barack Obama reported a salary of $157,082. The same year, Michelle Obama's salary was $273,618. As first lady, Michelle Obama has managed to be both iconic and accessible, a hard-to-achieve but quintessential balancing act for the greatest of political leaders. She has taken on the important issues of child nutrition and obesity, as well as the challenges facing our nation's military families. And on both issues, her unflagging leadership and unimpeachable achievements have been clear. But no doubt the speculation about Obama's next steps is partly related to this: Voters who enthusiastically supported her husband's campaign have been disillusioned by the messiness of governance, largely due to the unprecedented hostility of the Republican Party, but certainly made worse by President Obama's inability to outmaneuver his opponents either in rhetoric or in legislation. All that hope and change can fizzle in the face of reality, but Michelle Obama still seems full of the same optimism that once drove voters to the polls. Moreover, those of us who often long to see President Obama be more confrontational, or even angry and aggressive, sometimes see more of that raw fighting spirit in his wife. Should she someday choose to run for office, Michelle Obama may prove an even more gifted politician than her husband, especially when it comes to dodging the incoming attacks and getting things done. All the buzzing around Hillary Clinton's potential presidential run can't help but encourage the speculation about Michelle Obama, the prospect of another first lady running for the Senate and maybe, someday, a higher office. It's worth noting that Michelle Obama's approval ratings are higher than Hillary Clinton's were when she was first lady. Michelle Obama's approval ratings are also higher than her husband's. The political stars might certainly be aligned: Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois is a Republican in the Obamas' Democratic home state and would be up for re-election in November 2016, just as the Obama White House would be drawing to an end. Should Michelle Obama choose to run, she would be a formidable candidate in every way, from public speaking to fundraising to policy to media and more. But either way, just the fact that anyone is speculating sends a flattering signal to a beloved first lady who America would clearly like to keep in the public eye.","Sally Kohn: Article notes Michelle Obama's recent higher profile. Does it presage Senate run?
Why not? she says. Before becoming first lady, she was accomplished attorney .
Kohn says she's been effective advocate on nutrition, military families; her approval rating high .
Kohn: She'd be a formidable candidate, and America seems to like to see her in public eye ."
"(CNN) -- Sing it with me, kids! I'm a little Nazi short and stout, here is mein handle, here is mein spout. So, JCPenney is selling a new teapot that looks sort of like Adolf Hitler. Well, inasmuch as a teapot can actually appear like a fascist dictator. But it does. And, really, it might be the greatest advertising gaffe you'll ever see. At least until Gilbert Gottfried somehow becomes a spokesman for Tampax. ""Damn it, Jim, what were we thinking?"" Back to the teapot: It didn't take long for motorists on Southern California's 405 freeway -- where evening plans go to die -- to notice something in the sky that looked a little unusual. It was a billboard promoting this new kitchen essential. And there was no mistaking its resemblance. Pure Hitler. (Not to be confused with the classic Eagles double album by the same name.) Now, in case you can't quite figure out the similarities in the teapot image, notice that the top handle swoops wider to one side mimicking Hitler's dark, curtained hair. The knob on the lid closely resembles his infamous trademark toothbrush moustache. And the spout rises into the air as though he's giving a Nazi salute. That, or he's just waving to the Eva Braun coffee maker. Either way, it's him. However, at this time I can't confirm whether or not the Hitler teapot is designed with only one testicle. Clearly, that little attention to detail would prove this was far more than a simple coincidence. Mind you, the standard two testicles would be equally concerning. Regardless, I'm still willing to give JCPenney the benefit of the doubt that this was all just an accident. (The retailer didn't respond to our request for comment.) Though, to be fair, as a spectator of life with a front row seat, I do enjoy the controversy. For if you're going to accidentally have your product resemble a famous person, somehow, by a strange law of comedy that can't be explained, the absolute worst human being in the history of the world is far more amusing than, say, Tom Hanks. Now, understand that this particular teapot, from JCPenney's exclusive Michael Graves Design collection, quickly went viral after images of the billboard appeared on Reddit and Twitter. And that's when things turned delightfully melodramatic. Culver City's Democratic mayor, Jeffrey Cooper, complained to Mother Jones magazine: ""I am disappointed JCPenney actually put that billboard up in the first place. ... As a Jew, I am offended, (and) as an elected official, I am mad that the city I represent is linked to this."" Presumably, he then breathed heavily into a paper bag for half an hour while listening to Enya. Seriously, pull yourself together, man. If anything, here's all you had to say: . ""Yep. Definitely looks like Hitler. Surprised they didn't see it, but I'm pretty sure there was no intention to offend anyone. My guess is they'll take down the billboard and apologize."" Which is exactly what JCPenney did. They took down the billboard and even had some fun on Twitter replying to comments. In fact, when comedian Patton Oswalt tweeted, ""Well, JC Penney, get ready to sell a S***LOAD of these teakettles to a lot of ironic hipsters,"" the retailer quickly responded with, ""Totally unintentional. But they'll need to grab it in stores since it's sold out online. #SadHipsters."" Naturally, sales skyrocketed after the photos went viral. The $40 teapot is now back-ordered on JCPenney's site until late June, and some of the teapots even started listing on eBay for $200. Sadly, I have to admit that now I kind of want one for my house as a conversation piece. ""So, what do you think of my Hitler teapot?"" ""I think you need to put on pants."" Not surprisingly, the sales boom started when it all became one big social media circus. Which is why you sort of have to applaud the seemingly levelheaded responses by JCPenney, which never equaled the drama of Cooper's outrage culture hysteria. Even the Anti-Defamation League took it in stride, commenting to Mother Jones that ""JCPenney did the right thing by responding to public concerns and removing the tea pot from their product line. We take JCPenney at their word that any resemblance to the Nazi dictator was completely unintended."" In the end, it's just a minor blip in the cosmos. But, from a social perspective, what's truly interesting is that Hitler -- at least as an iconic image -- doesn't seem to have the same meaning to a newer generation which is further removed from his horrors and unthinkable crimes. Kind of like Genghis Khan to anyone during the last 700 years. These days, to many, Hitler has become just sort of a caricature, having transcended his evil reality into something far more abstract. Like a teapot. And this explains why we nonchalantly have the website Cats That Look Like Hitler. Which, clearly, by the laws of comedy, is way more fun than dogs that look like Tom Hanks.","The Hitler-like teapot on a JCPenney billboard caught the attention of motorists .

"London, England (CNN) -- He got his first big break at art school, when an employee from Wilkinson Sword saw his graduation show and commissioned him to design some disposable razors. Today, Dick Powell is one of the world's leading figures in design. As one half of British design agency Seymourpowell, he is responsible for such milestone products as the pocket mobile phone and cordless kettle and has designed for major institutions including Unilever, Panasonic and NestlÃ©. He has twice been appointed President of the UK's Design and Art Direction (D&AD) board, who honored his outstanding contribution to creativity with their President's Award. Recently, somewhere in between working on a new concept for the Virgin Galactic spacecraft and running a business, Powell has found time to take on a new role -- that of the mentor. Not a stranger to TV after his series ""Better by Design"" with company co-founder Richard Seymour, Powell appears on screen for CNN's Blueprint to offer guidance to a group of ambitious students who have created electricity conducting paint. We caught the design kingpin for an exclusive Q&A. CNN: What are the three most important principles of good product design? Dick Powell: That's easy. Design is about making things better -- that means better for people, better for business and better for the world. CNN: Which product from the last decade is the best example of a meeting between form and function? DP: Apple's iPhone. It's what we call a meta-product, so it's a combination of hardware, software and service. CNN: What's the best way for an amateur designer to turn a great idea into a reality? DP: Never give up. That would be the first piece of advice. Getting a new product to market is an amazingly difficult thing to do. It's not about the design. The design is just one part of it. You need the finance to fund it. The most important thing, which most people get wrong, is that they think they have a good idea when in fact it's probably not a good idea. It's a great idea to them but they need to think very hard about their potential market and be convinced that it is going to have a volume acceptance, because you can't get products to market without high numbers. Also, people often forget about distribution -- it is fine to have a great product but you've got to get it in front of people. CNN: How does the environment you work in affect creativity? DP: I think it's more about culture than environment. It's important to have a great office and studio to work in but it's really about the culture -- inside the studio and the business is what matters. If you've got an innovative and creative culture alive in the business then that is all you need. CNN: How do you keep the spirit of innovation in your company alive? DP: By always striving to be better, by never being satisfied with the way things are. CNN: Some areas of industry, such as healthcare, have greatly benefited from innovative design. Are there any industries that you think are crying out for pioneering design solutions? DP: I don't think so, no. I think nearly every industry I can think of has become involved with design to a greater or lesser degree but there are none out there that are crying out for it that I can think of. I think the service industry is going to benefit the most in the near future. It comes back to what I was saying about meta-products. What defines them is that they provide a service of some kind, so from the machine that gives you your money out of a wall to the car you drive. For the Internet of Things we are going to be seeing, to a much greater extent, the provision of service with everything that we buy and use. CNN: Is product design a science or an art? DP: Well, it's a combination of those two things that really defines design. It's not necessarily science. I suppose it could be seen as a science. Quiz: Looks cool ... what does it do? CNN: What are the most common mistakes people make when designing a new product? DP: Designing a product is like juggling plates. One plate might be function and another might be market, another manufacturers, another cost and another look and feel. There are 15 or 20 of those plates and you've got to keep them all spinning all of the time. Designers tend to spin up one or two of them, particularly look and feel, at the expense of the others and the they start to fall off. Cost is a plate that often falls off. Designers get carried away with look and feel and function and lose sight of cost, manufacturer ability, distribution and market. CNN: What is the proudest achievement in your career to date? DP: I think it's when Rich and I received the D&AD President's Award. CNN: What's the best piece of advice anyone has ever given you? DP: Well it's a universal truth: Treat others as you like to be treated yourself.","Dick Powell, a world-renowned designer is responsible for products including cordless kettle .

"(CNN) -- Smart cars are good for the environment, good for parking in cramped cities and good for a driver's bottom line. Then again, all that thinking gets turned upside down when the vehicles do. That's what happened to four of these fuel-efficient vehicles in San Francisco, tossed aside like a piece of trash. Why? Authorities don't know, leaving Bay Area residents to speculate that anything from pranksters to people upset about hipsters. All Brandon Michael knows is what he saw -- a group of men, in the dark of night, walking up to one Smart car. ""(They) all just huddled around it and then just lifted it up and set it on its hind legs,"" Michael told CNN affiliate KRON. The basically vertical vehicle that Michael described -- its front lights pointing toward the heavens -- wasn't alone. Two others in the same 1- to 2-square mile area were flipped on their side and one was on its roof, according to San Francisco police spokesman Gordon Shyy. Tossing a Smart car isn't necessarily easy, unless you compare to other vehicles. Unoccupied, a typical one weighs just over 1,800 pounds; a Ford Explorer, by contrast, clocks in at about 4,500 pounds. Authorities have launched a felony vandalism investigation since the first calls came in around 1 a.m. Monday, said Shyy. The police spokesman said witnesses identified the culprits as six to eight individuals dressed in black. If they end up convicted, they could be facing jail time and a felony. Authorities haven't identified any suspects yet, and the fact the flippings took place in residential areas -- where surveillance video isn't likely -- makes the investigation a challenge. Florence Dabokemp, a San Francisco resident and Smart car driver, speculates people simply acting out are to blame. And while she hasn't been victimized, Dabokemp says she's not sure what she'd do if that did happen. ""I would be out of luck,"" she told KRON. ""I would be out of a car, because I couldn't afford to fix it.""","Police got first reports early Monday that 4 Smart cars had been tossed .

"(Lonely Planet) -- No, there's no need to remortgage the house to visit Tahiti and French Polynesia. Despite a reputation for opulence and exclusivity, it's perfectly possible to visit these dreamy islands on a limited budget -- if you make the right decisions. Affordable accommodation . Glossy brochures focus on ultra-swish resorts, but French Polynesia actually has a pretty wide range of accommodation options. You can keep lodging costs down by staying in small guesthouses and pensions (homestays) that are sprinkled around the islands. They're nothing glam or ostentatious, just modest operations that blend perfectly into the tropical surroundings. At the cheaper end of the scale (around US$80 a double), they consist of simple, local-style bungalows with cold showers and thin walls. Upmarket versions (plan on US$100-120) have lots of amenities and are more comfortable. Lonely Planet: The world's finest freebies . These options are generally excellent value, and they offer good opportunities for cultural immersion; they're mostly family-run operations (which ensures your money goes straight into local pockets) and provide much more personal, idiosyncratic experiences than hotels -- the perfect island experience. Most pensions are in scenic locations, tucked away in greenery-cloaked hills or near the ocean. In the Tuamotu archipelago, they feature a fab lagoon frontage -- at US$90 a double, how does a bungalow facing the turquoise waters of the lagoon sound? Good news, too, for those who want to spend their holiday under canvas: French Polynesia has a smattering of camping options. Don't expect full-blown camp sites, though; generally it's a matter of guesthouses having areas where you can pitch your tent and have use of the facilities. The price? Around US$15 per person. Choosing the best-value islands . As much as Paris doesn't represent France, Bora Bora, Tahiti and Moorea (the beloved islands of tour operators), don't sum up French Polynesia. There are about 30 islands (scattered in five archipelagoes) that have tourist facilities, which means that you've got plenty of choice. Tip: skip the heavily-publicized islands, such as Bora Bora, which are very expensive, and consider lesser-known, off-the-radar islands, which offer greater value for money. A few suggestions: Maupiti (Bora Bora's little sister), Raiatea, Tahaa (in the Society islands), Mataiva, Tikehau (in the Tuamotus), Nuku Hiva, Ua Huka, Ua Pou (in the Marquesas), Raivavae, and Rurutu (in the Australs). Lonely Planet: How to plan the perfect destination wedding . How to eat cheaply . It's possible to eat reasonably cheaply by patronizing snack stands and getting takeaway meals like sandwiches, salads, grilled fish and meat or fish burgers. Most pensions offer half board (bed, breakfast and one other meal) at around US$20 to US$30 per person (set menu) if you reserve in advance (usually the day before). This is a fantastic way to meet locals and sample the local cuisine at economical prices. Self-catering can also save you a lot of money; many pensions have well-equipped kitchens. Fresh fish, fruits and vegetables are easily found at roadside stalls found on most major islands. Budget-friendly ways to get around . Air Tahiti, the domestic airline, has six island-hopping air passes offering inclusive fares to a number of islands. Thus, you'll save about 30% on regular flights. If you're looking for adventure and have plenty of time on your hands, boat travel is even cheaper. Cargo vessels serve most islands on a regular basis, especially within the Society group and the Tuamotus. Hiring a car is expensive but it's possible to get around by bike on many islands; distances are rarely great, the traffic is rarely heavy and the roads are rarely hilly. Bikes can be rented for less than US$15 per day. Picking the right season . It helps to travel off-season: prices are generally discounted and there's more chance of being able to bargain. Flights are full to bursting in July and August and prices skyrocket accordingly. The Christmas to New Year period is also particularly busy. The best deals can be found during the shoulder seasons -- April to June and September to November. Lonely Planet: Maui for foodies . © 2011 Lonely Planet.

"(CNN) -- Beyond a vague familiarity with the world's major airlines, most travelers know little about the hundreds of carriers transporting passengers across the globe. Sunday's deadly air crash in Nigeria raises questions about the safety of international airlines. So how do passengers find safety information? There are several things travelers should look for to gauge an airline's safety, according to Bill Voss, CEO of the Flight Safety Foundation, an international nonprofit organization. In short, you're looking for a Category 1 ranking from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and registration with the International Air Transport Association, an international trade group. Membership with a major airline alliance helps, and you likely want to avoid airlines banned by the European Union. The Federal Aviation Administration looks at international aviation regulators. The FAA program assesses the safety standards of the civil aviation authorities of countries with airlines operating in the United States. ""We look at the ability of the aviation authority in the country to administer its aviation community in accordance with international regulations. We don't look at individual airlines,"" said FAA spokesman Les Dorr. Countries with aviation authorities that meet standards set by the International Civil Aviation Organization receive a Category 1 ranking. Those that don't receive a Category 2 designation. Nigeria, the site of the crash that killed more than 160 people, has a Category 1 ranking. Twenty-five nations, nearly a quarter of those assessed, hold a Category 2 ranking, including the Philippines, Bangladesh, Barbados, Cote D'Ivoire, Ghana, Indonesia and Israel. The International Civil Aviation Organization, the U.N. agency that defines international standards, also focuses oversight on regulators rather than airlines. The agency has conducted mandatory safety audits of the civil aviation authorities of member countries since 1999. Most countries publish the audits, but it's not mandatory, ""and the ones that you really want to see are the ones that don't publish,"" Voss said. Despite occasional catastrophic crashes, airline accident rates have seen ""massive improvements"" in the last few decades, he said. The global accident rate for commercial air service fluctuated between 3.9 and 4.6 accidents per million departures between 2005 and 2010, according to International Civil Aviation Organization. The agency's 2011 figures have not been released. In 2010, the global rate was four accidents per million departures. Africa had the highest regional accident rate in 2010 of 16.8, four times the global average, but Africa accounts for the lowest percentage of global traffic volume. North America's accident rate, 3.3 per million departures, was below the world average in 2010. The region had the highest number of accidents -- 35 -- but no fatalities. Europe also had an accident rate of 3.3 per million departures with 24 accidents, two of which included fatalities. The trade group International Air Transport Association does its own safety audits on air carriers. The organization's registry is searchable by airline. All of the association's more than 240 member airlines must meet audit standards to maintain membership. ""(Airlines) who are IATA member carriers actually have a far better safety rate than the industry standard,"" Voss said. Dana Air, the Nigerian carrier involved in Sunday's crash, does not appear on the registry. Voss said the carrier may have chosen not to be audited or may not have passed. The cause of Sunday's accident in Nigeria is still unknown. The European Union's ""black list"" provides another safety benchmark. The EU takes a more aggressive approach to screening individual carriers and has banned more than 280 airlines from 25 nations from operating within the EU since 2006. African, Indonesian and Philippine airlines figure prominently on the EU's banned list, as do carriers in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. The EU also has a list of carriers subject to operational restrictions. No Nigerian airlines appear on either list. Membership in a major alliance, including Star Alliance, SkyTeam and oneworld, can also be considered a reassurance to nervous travelers, Voss said. Member airlines tend to monitor each other, reinforcing high safety standards. There are no guarantees, but air travel is still much safer than other means of transportation. ""Particularly in the developing world, you have to look at how extraordinarily safe aviation is. Even though an airline might appear a little risky by your Western standards, it could easily be 1,000 times safer than taking the same trip on the road,"" Voss said.","International regulators have lists and registries dedicated to airline safety .

"(CNN) -- The University of Florida's health system is reviewing the application of a heart surgeon from Kentucky who came under scrutiny after a CNN investigation into the deaths of babies in his care. Dr. Mark Plunkett was the chief heart surgeon at Kentucky Children's Hospital before he resigned to take a position with University of Florida Health. When CNN contacted an official from the University of Florida last month, he said he was excited to have Plunkett come work there. ""We think he'll do excellent in our environment,"" said Dr. Timothy Flynn, senior associate dean for clinical affairs at the University of Florida College of Medicine. ""We had extensive discussions with his colleagues in Kentucky, all of whom thought he performed very, very well."" But after CNN published its story, UF Health spokeswoman Melanie Ross said his application is still being considered. ""Our review of Dr. Plunkett's application is ongoing as we continue to follow our standard processes,"" Flynn told the Gainesville Sun newspaper. ""His hiring is contingent in part on his obtaining a Florida medical license and completing our credentialing process, which has not yet occurred."" Kentucky Children's Hospital stopped doing heart surgeries last October. Parents react to story . Dr. Michael Karpf, executive vice president for health affairs at the University of Kentucky's health care system, which includes Children's Hospital, said he put the program on hold because the mortality rates weren't what he wanted to them to be. After fighting requests to release its pediatric heart surgery outcomes, citing patient privacy, the hospital on Friday provided some figures. They show the overall mortality rate between 2008 and 2012 ranged from 4.5% to 7.1%, which the hospital said is comparable to those of programs of similar size. CNN has asked Kentucky Children's Hospital for more details. CNN contacted four families whose babies had surgeries with Plunkett during an eight-week period last year. Two died, and the two children who survived had additional surgeries elsewhere. The parents voiced their frustration that the University of Kentucky is not releasing more information about why the surgeries stopped or why Plunkett left. The University of Kentucky is conducting an internal review of the events at Children's Hospital last year. The hospital plans to hire a new surgeon and reopen the program at some point. Karpf told CNN that when the program opens again, it will be first class: ""I won't be satisfied until our program is as good as anybody's program,"" he said. CNN attempted to contact Plunkett by e-mail Friday but has not received a response. CNN's Jennifer Bixler and William Hudson contributed to this report.","NEW: The hospital releases overall mortality rates; CNN asks for more details .

"(CNN) -- Even if it's not the land of opportunity it once was, the Big Mobility Scooter still has a lot going for it. In fact, there are at least 10 things by our count that you can't find as good anywhere else on earth. More: 10 things Italy does better than anywhere else . With the caveat that China is on a trajectory to take over at least six of these categories by 2016, we present them without further interruption. Except for this last interruption (interrupting also being something Americans are fantastic at): Be sure to express your wholesale agreement with our list in the comments. 1. Effusive greetings . ""Ahoy!"" ""Aloha!"" ""Hey!"" ""Hola!"" ""Howdy!"" ""Hiya!"" ""Ho there!"" ""Well, look who it is!"" ""What's happenin'?!"" ""'Sup!"" ""Yo!"" ""Hello!"" The variety and vibrancy of the American greeting is unrivaled, upholding a threshold of friendliness that Americans demand, Europeans find onerous and others find perplexing. Want to slip through somewhere un-greeted? Forget it. Whether you're leaving a hotel, shopping for a pair of jeans or just trying to get around a bystander, someone's going to pop out from the shadows with a neighborly salutation, the enthusiasm of which may border on deranged. More: Things Americans love/hate about returning to the U.S. 2. Road trips . If we're talking about something that can be done while seated, Americans are probably going to excel at it. Germany likes to lay claim to the world's first road trip, but having come of age at the same time as the automobile, the United States was custom-built for it. With roadside oddities like Carhenge in Nebraska and the world's largest ball of paint in Indiana, along with infamous rest areas and national parks (more on those later) dotting America's majestic roadscape at uniform intervals, you're never far from the next adventure. Unless you're driving through Texas. More: How to pretend you're Canadian when you travel . 3. Derbies . With all due respect to the English city, the U.S. is the home of the derby in all its forms, be it racing, smashing or haberdashing. Originating in the county fairs of the nation's 1950s backwoods, demolition derbies, like the one held annually in Delaware County, New York, pit hulking early-model autos against one another in contests of Americanly excessive ramming until only one remains functional. On the oval track, Louisville's Kentucky Derby is a spectacle of horseshoed pageantry, while roller derbies from Austin to Seattle are cataclysms of people-wheeled fury. More: Doh! 20 biggest travel mistakes . 4. Beer . Not to keep taking shots at Germany, but there's only so much you can do with barley and hops. Live a little, Üter! By contrast, American brewers aren't bound by purity restrictions on their craft, allowing them to push the pint glass with new additives, processes, styles and malt and hops strains moved through the largest number of breweries of any nation on earth. Whether it's Portland, Oregon's Hopworks, Grand Rapids, Michigan's Founders, or Asheville, North Carolina's Wicked Weed breweries, in no country is beer more innovative. More: 8 best beer towns in the U.S.A. 5. Diversity . The U.S. is a microcosm of nearly every world culture, climate, landscape and category of wildlife. (And whatever doesn't occur naturally gets recreated at Disney.) Beaches extend from Cape Cod to Kaanapali; bayous encircle the Gulf of Mexico; alpine mountains streak the Rockies and Appalachians; rain forests span the Pacific Northwest; deserts stretch across the Southwest. Cougars, wolves, bear, bison and mustangs roam plains and forests; gators, crocs, whales, dolphins, turtles and snakes frequent the coasts; condors, eagles, falcons, flamingos, bats and pterodactyls -- just making sure you're still with us -- inhabit the skies. But of course the Melting Pot concept was built on ethnic diversity. Despite the politics of immigration, the U.S. has and will continue to welcome the world's huddled (and also brilliant) masses, making it as heterogeneous as any nation on earth. 6. Canyons . Geo-diversity has pocked much of the landscape with vast gorges and canyons that create expansive pockets of pure emptiness ringed by the most stunning rock formations, vegetation and slack-jawed tourists imaginable. Unbelievable until experienced, Utah's Bryce Canyon is the closest you can get to another planet without tickets on Virgin Galactic. Then there's Black Canyon of the Gunnison (Colorado), Palo Duro Canyon (Texas), Canyon de Chelly (Arizona), Sequioa and Kings Canyon (California), Waimea Canyon (Hawaii) and hundreds more to round out a list so deep and wide that it makes the U.S. the hands-down winner in this category even without mentioning the Grandest one of them all.

Overlooked during the westward expansion of the American frontier in the 1800s, Yellowstone was made the world's first national park the way you might give the last kid picked for kickball the top spot in the order. Turns out it's one of America's great national treasures, a tradition extended to 400 more areas comprising more than 84 million acres of buttes, plateaus, rapids, coral reefs, caverns, badlands, volcanoes, glaciers, falls, fjords, swamplands, sandstone arches, mangroves, geysers, gift shops and excellent interpretive centers ranging from coast to coast.

Make all the fat jokes you want -- seriously, they're hilarious -- but no other nation offers the portions and varieties of culinary experimentation found in the U.S. This year's gastronomic breakthrough was the cronut, a croissant-donut hybrid introduced by Dominique Ansel Bakery in New York City. It's just the latest in a litany of extreme foods that's yielded curated cupcakes, ramen burgers, sushirritoes, Korean tacos -- the only limit will be an eventual shortage of truffles. There's nothing the home of super-sizing won't deep-fry, roll in bacon or drown with nacho cheese sauce, proving Americans eat like none other. Just don't ask them to do math. More: 8 things you should know about your hotel pillow . 9. Sports . Most countries have a national sport. The U.S. has four. (OK, three; you can have hockey, Canada.) While the world's most popular sport, soccer, has yet to gain critical traction in the U.S., it also has the burden of competing with the seasonal panoply of baseball, football, basketball and hockey. That's tough enough without NASCAR, golf and action sports like extreme death gliding and low-orbit cloudboarding or whatever else is nipping at soccer's heels. Some of the best places to catch a game in the U.S. are Wrigley Field (Chicago) and Fenway Park (Boston) for baseball; Tiger Stadium (Baton Rouge, Louisiana) and Lambeau Field (Green Bay, Wisconsin) for football; and Cameron Indoor Stadium (Durham, North Carolina) and Rupp Arena (Lexington, Kentucky) for college basketball. More: 101 best sports bars in the U.S. 10. Moving pictures .

"(CNN) -- Pope Francis has appointed Archbishop Pietro Parolin to succeed Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone as the Holy See's secretary of state, the Vatican said Saturday. Until now, Parolin, a 58-year-old Italian, was the diplomatic representative of the Holy See in Venezuela. He has also worked in Nigeria and Mexico, as well as within the Vatican. The secretary of state assumes the role of the Vatican's head of government and is considered the most important figure in the Vatican after the pope. ""I feel very strongly the grace of this call, which is yet another and the latest of God's surprises in my life,"" Parolin said in a statement quoted by Vatican Radio. ""Above all, I feel the full weight of the responsibility placed upon me: this call entrusts to me a difficult and challenging mission, before which my powers are weak and my abilities poor."" CNN's Vatican correspondent John Allen, writing in the National Catholic Reporter, described Parolin as a ""veteran Vatican diplomat,"" who ""has been on the front lines of shaping the Vatican's response to virtually every geopolitical challenge of the past two decades."" Parolin has been on many people's shortlists for the job since Francis became pope in March and signaled that he would shake things up, said Allen. The cleric has more than a quarter-century's experience in the Vatican's diplomatic service and is seen as one of the brightest of his generation. ""By naming a consummate insider, Francis appears to want to 'reboot' the Vatican's operating system back to a point when it was perceived to operate efficiently, rather than scrapping it entirely,"" said Allen. ""The pick has been keenly anticipated, given that frustration with perceived breakdowns in governance under Bertone was part of what led the cardinals in March to elect a Latin American outsider to the papacy, handing him a clear reform mandate. Parolin now profiles as a key figure in that effort."" Francis has already taken a number of steps to try to reform the Curia, the Vatican administration, since his election. In July, he set up an expert committee to recommend reforms to the economic and administrative structures of the Holy See. He's also ordered more scrutiny of the Vatican bank, which has been plagued by financial scandals for years. CNN's Bharati Naik and Richard Allen Greene contributed to this report.","NEW: Parolin is a veteran Vatican diplomat seen as key to pope's reform efforts, analyst says .

"(CNN) -- Last year Kevin Hart sold out two consecutive nights at New York's famed Madison Square Garden, a venue that most standup comedians aspire to at some point in their career. For Hart, who took the arena's stage as part of his global Let Me Explain comedy tour, which also filled Los Angeles' Staples Center and London's O2 Arena, the occasion was so momentous that it deserved its own film. The comedian, along with directors Leslie Small and Tim Story, used the performance as the centerpiece of his new movie, ""Kevin Hart: Let Me Explain,"" which opens in theaters Wednesday. Although largely a standup movie, ""Let Me Explain"" is framed with a fictional intro where Hart is inundated with a barrage of questions about his life and career -- all of which he determines to answer onstage at Madison Square Garden. This opening offers the comedian an opportunity to showcase the worldwide aspect of the Let Me Explain tour before eventually revealing his entire standup set. The comedian, who has numerous feature films in the works and recently made a brief appearance in the apocalyptic comedy ""This Is The End,"" spoke with CNN.com in a suite at the Beverly Hills Four Seasons the day of the movie's premiere. Hart, clad in sunglasses to veil his exhaustion, recounted the process of creating ""Let Me Explain,"" why he got so emotional onstage at Madison Square Garden and how he might be the busiest person alive. CNN: When you were filming your Let Me Explain comedy tour last year, was the intention always to make it into a feature film? Kevin Hart: Yes. I wasn't sure of the direction I wanted to take the movie in, but I just knew I wanted to document everything I was doing that year because it was so much, especially the world tour aspect of it. It was just putting camera crews in place to capture absolutely everything that we did and at the end of it just put the pieces of the puzzle I had in my head together. It all came together well. But as we were going along I tracked it and I knew the pieces I had, and it was just tying them together. CNN: How did you come up with the idea for how the movie is framed? Hart: I need a segue into the documentary aspect of [the movie] and the best way to do that, I felt, was to jokingly address what's been happening to me for the past two years. Everybody coming up to me asking questions, and when I go to answer it they tell me what their answer is. You don't allow me to tell them what's going on -- you tell me what you think you know because you've heard things about me. It was a different way to open a standup film and I'm all about being different and trying to break ground with original ideas. CNN: Do you legitimately feel like you have to explain yourself? Hart: Yes and no. At the end of the day your fans are the people who support you in and out. And their opinions matter. As a celebrity you can try to say you don't care and say, ""This is my life, I don't live for other people"" all you want. But we don't. We have no obligation to do things for our fans, but my feeling is that we don't get to where we are or get what we get without the support of our fans. So if there's questions going around that your fans have because of things that they've heard, I think you do owe it to them to address it. CNN: At the end of the movie you get really emotional about being in Madison Square Garden. What does it mean to you to perform in a venue like that? Hart: You're looking at me achieving a goal that I didn't think was achievable. I'm sure everyone knows now that only a few have performed in Madison Square Garden. That list is so small. Now I'm on that list. I'm a part of a very small group, which is unbelievable. You relish in that moment for a second. When I did that onstage it choked me up because I genuinely thought about what I've accomplished and where I was and what I did to get here. And now that I'm here, the sky's the limit. I'm in love with this, with making people laugh. And the fact that I had this venue to do it in was crazy. CNN: Now that you've conquered Madison Square Garden, do you have a new goal you're aiming to achieve? Is there even a bigger venue you could play? Hart: I have no idea where you go next. None. No idea! I'm scared. CNN: Do you approach standup in the same way you would approach a movie or TV role? Hart: I don't approach it like it's a movie role. I genuinely love doing standup and I'm a comedian first, so for me what makes my standup special is the fact that I don't have to adapt or adjust. I am who I am. I appeal to everyone, hence in the movie doing a world tour. I'm not changing, I'm not adjusting my voice, I'm not changing my speed and the way that I talk. This is me. I'm actually funny. So I think the prep for that is me just enjoying what I do. CNN: When you talk about your family and your kids in your standup, is that coming from a personal place? Hart: Personal place. The motivation is wanting to put myself out there so people can see that I'm genuine and I'm real. What you see is what you get. It's not fake. I'm not trying to be someone else. I'm being myself. CNN: What else do you have coming up beyond ""Let Me Explain?"" Hart: I have like five movies coming out. Everything will be out in 2014 and 2015. I think I'm getting the opportunity to play the kind of character I'm interested in now. The movie ""Ride Along,"" starring Ice Cube and myself, is an action comedy and I'm doing everything I ever wanted to do in the film. [I also have] ""About Last Night,"" which is a remake of the original, starring Michael Ealy, Joy Bryant, Regina Hall and myself, and ""Grudge Match,"" which stars Sylvester Stallone and Robert De Niro. I'm about to do one with Will Ferrell [and] I'm about to do one with Seth Rogan. I'm sure I'm forgetting one. CNN: And you were just cast in the new Chris Rock movie as well, right? Hart: Yeah! My part, from what I understand, is I'm playing an assistant. I haven't read the newest draft that came in. But it's a funny reveal cameo he asked me to do. CNN: What's the status of the second season of your TV show ""Real Husbands of Hollywood?"" Hart: That will be in its third season. The second season starts premiering, I think, in September or October, and that's probably when we'll start shooting [the third season]. CNN: What does your average day look like? Hart: No sleep! Right now I'm probably going on 27 hours awake. So my days are hectic. Once I'm done with this today I go to Conan O'Brien. After that I go to the premiere. I got to introduce the premiere. Then I get on a plane and I fly to Vegas. I land and I go straight to the set and I'm shooting until 4 a.m. It's ridiculously crazy. At some point I'm just going to shut down. I don't know when it's going to happen today, but someone's going to stop talking to me and I'm going to be asleep. Once I stop talking it's all over.","Kevin Hart is releasing a new concert movie called ""Let Me Explain""

"(CNN) -- Much of the war crimes trial of former Liberian president Charles Taylor focused on the role played by so-called ""conflict diamonds"" in funding rebels in conflict areas. What are ""conflict diamonds?"" Conflict or ""blood"" diamonds are illegally traded to fund conflict in war-torn areas, particularly in central and western Africa, according to the World Diamond council, which represents the commercial diamond trade. The United Nations defines conflict diamonds as ""...diamonds that originate from areas controlled by forces or factions opposed to legitimate and internationally recognized governments, and are used to fund military action in opposition to those governments, or in contravention of the decisions of the Security Council."" They are generally in ""rough"" form, meaning they have recently been extracted and not yet cut. At the height of the civil war in Sierra Leone, it is estimated that conflict diamonds represented approximately four percent of the world's diamond production. What role did they play in the war? Taylor was accused of arming rebel groups and terrorizing civilians during the decade-long civil war in exchange for uncut diamonds smuggled out to him in empty mayonnaise jars. He was found guilty of aiding the rebels, but a judge ruled that prosecutors failed to prove he was in command of them. During the trial British supermodel Naomi Campbell was summoned as a witness for the prosecution. She told the court she received a gift of ""dirty-looking stones"" from two men following a dinner hosted by then-South African President Nelson Mandela in 1997. The prosecution argued the stones were ""blood diamonds"" -- a personal gift from Taylor. That claim contradicted Taylor's testimony that he never handled the precious stones that fueled the conflict. Who suffers from conflict diamonds? Apart from the innocent people caught up in the conflicts that the trade fuels, thousands of men, women and children in countries such as Sierra Leone are used as slaves to extract diamonds. They are often forced to use primitive, back-breaking methods such as digging into mud or gravel along river banks with their bare hands. The collected material is then separated using hand-held sieves. What is being done to stop the trade? Late last year a major international environmental group pulled out of the so-called Kimberley Process designed to guarantee that diamonds do not come from conflict zones. Global Witness said it had refused ""to evolve and address the clear links between diamonds, violence and tyranny."" The Kimberley Process started when Southern African diamond-producing states met in Kimberley, South Africa, in May 2000, to discuss ways to stop the trade in conflict diamonds and ensure that diamond purchases were not funding violence. The result was an agreement by the United Nations, European Union, the governments of 74 countries, the World Diamond Council -- representing the industry -- and a number of interest groups such as Global Witness. They established the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS), whereby members are required to certify that all rough diamond exports are produced through legitimate mining and sales activities and are ""conflict-free."" Each shipment carries a certificate that details where the diamonds came from, how they were mined, where they were cut and polished, the parties involved, and their ultimate destination. The idea is that members of the Kimberley Process cannot trade with non-members. Is it working? According to Amy Barry of Global Witness, the Kimberley Process has yet to demonstrate itself capable of stopping the trade because of a lack of political will among member states. ""Zimbabwe, for example, is a test case for the KP,"" she told CNN in 2010, alleging that Robert Mugabe's regime has benefited from the sale of blood diamonds despite it being a member of the Kimberley Process. She said the huge Marange diamond fields of eastern Zimbabwe are operated by military-run syndicates who beat or kill miners who don't mine for them or pay bribes. The extreme violence perpetrated by the military even included the mass murder of hundreds of miners by helicopter gunships, she added. CNN gets exclusive access to Marange mines . But with just one or two member states able to veto any punitive action against abuses or infringements of the KP scheme, no decisive action has been taken against Zimbabwe. ""This consensus decision-making means tough decisions don't get made,"" said Barry. ""Certain countries are putting economic and political interests in front of defending the fundamental principles of the scheme."" Is the ""conflict trade"" limited to diamonds? No. According to Global Witness, rebel fighters and army units have hijacked the trade in mineral ores, used in the production of mobile phones and computers, from eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), while subjecting the local population to massacres, rape, extortion, and forced labor. The ""conflict minerals"" are then laundered into the global supply chain by export houses, before being transformed into refined metals by large international smelting firms. Global Witness says the operations of some of the world's leading consumer brands are now being scrutinized for evidence of links to this rogue trade.","Much of war crimes trial of Charles Taylor centered on ""conflict diamonds""

"(CNN) -- The new North Tower is finally high enough to partially restore the skyline I used to see when I stepped outside my home in Greenwich Village. It was a glorious sight before September 11, 2001. Two shiny towers created a reference point for miles around, giving Manhattan the center of its compass, just like the Eiffel tower does in Paris or the Capitol Building in Washington. I pointed out the new one to my little girl, Luna, this morning on the way to school. ""This is how we know we're walking west,"" I told her. ""Because the tower is to the South."" ""Is that like the one that fell down?"" she asked. Yes, I thought to myself, it actually is. When you make your way around upper Manhattan, there is an easy north-south, east-west street pattern to show you the way. But when you hit Greenwich Village, the streets go every which way. Before September 11, 2001, the easy way to find true north was to use the towers as a reference point. After that day, the compass just spun, as the city struggled to figure out which way to go. I had walked out of my apartment that day to see my tower, my reference point, with a burning hole punched deep inside its face. For the next few hours I ran around downtown reporting for CNN on a series of horrific events -- people leaping to their death, buildings collapsing, debris burning, and firefighters at odds with a fire that wouldn't go out. I lived alone back then, so when I finally went home a full day later I didn't have to explain to anyone why the absence of that tower made me feel as directionless as the city around me. And for many years, I walked back out my door beneath the empty sky and made my way north by mere habit. Triple-amputee veteran gets 'smart' home on September 11 . Luna was born in 2005, four years after the attacks, as the city was just finding its way. It speaks volumes about something when you can't explain it to a child. So I was happy that I wouldn't have to do that for a few years, although somehow her presence made it easier to chart a new course. September 11, 2005, was a beautiful, bright and sunny day. It was Primary day and I walked to vote, carrying Luna in a baby Bjorn. It was funny to see her tiny hands stressing to push the metal levers in the ballot box. By the time she could walk, the same Hudson River parks where ambulances had carted off the injured had been replaced by water parks and swing sets. She loved a particular duck pond where debris had sat idle for months. That year was also the fifth anniversary, but she didn't watch TV yet, so her youth spared me the annual reading of the names and the moments of silence. That year we also took her on her first plane trip and her tiny hands left prints on the window ovals as she marveled at the reflections of the sun. Note lets family know 9/11 victim went down fighting . By the time she was 3, the yellowing ""Missing"" posters that had dotted Greenwich Village in the days after the attack had been replaced by tiles painted by schoolchildren and strung along a chain link fence near our home. When she was 4, the nearby hospital shut down, closing the emergency room where stretchers had lined up to wait for the survivors that never came. The next year she started kindergarten at the school across the street. It was a hard day for me because the attacks had happened on the first day of school. A father shooting video of his kindergartener had given me the tape of his daughter's first-day smiles interrupted by the roar of a plane and a series of terrible images that replayed endlessly on TV. Our daughter wore a shiny pink raincoat on her big day as I took pictures of her disappearing into a sea of smiling schoolchildren marching into P.S. 41. Later that year, I invited one of the firefighters I'd connected with on September 11 to visit her class. She didn't tell the kids about her work on September 11; she just taught them to stop, drop and roll if they ever smelled smoke. Photos: Ground zero now . When she entered the first grade last year, the New York Public Schools had a curriculum about September 11 and we were warned to tell our children what had happened. The idea was to explain that some bad people had crashed planes into buildings and many of our neighbors had died. It seemed such a straightforward way to tell a story that ended with some 1,300 orphans, ensuing wars and economic mudslides. But it was enough for her. The school curriculum discussed how communities come together in times of tragedy and explains the role of flowers in grieving. How to honor a Muslim first responder? That same year, we took her to ground zero for the first time, to see what is now the 9/11 Memorial grounds. I had toured it with Michael Arad, the architect, for a CNN story before it opened, but it's amazing what details you notice when you see something through the eyes of a child. Every piece of that memorial seems to reflect the images of the Twin Towers -- the rectangular stones on the walkways, rectangular lamp posts and grates, the slatted benches and big rectangular grass pits. She loves the sounds of the waterfalls in the tower footprints and the way the shadows bounce off the walls. It is a place of memory, not mourning, and it carries a sense of peace. The city has travelled such a distance and my 6-year-old understands what happened there, but doesn't know enough to feel sad. We took her again a few months ago and pointed out how the names were cut out of the metal plates surrounding the footprints. I showed her the computers that let you print out cards of the victims. You can search them by name or place. We searched for people I knew and printed their cards. Then we looked for people from countries with which we have a connection. We chose a Colombian, and went to pay our respects. A man beside us was tracing the name of his son onto a piece of thin white paper. This time she did look sad. So did I.

I remember that old, sad boat and how it rallied that day, pumping water for 80 hours when the fireplugs went dry. Her teacher said it was the only thing that seemed age appropriate. They wondered why someone would fly planes into buildings if they knew they were going to die. The teacher said that made zero sense to them. Then school ended and it was a beautiful day again.

"(CNN) -- There's a website that lies to restaurants, making reservations under fake names, and then sells them to you. If that rubs you the wrong way, you're not alone. ReservationHop, which launched last week, was hit with a backlash so nasty, it led its creator to call himself ""the most hated person in San Francisco."" And it's just the latest on a list of recent startups that have some critics complaining that, in the go-go Silicon Valley startup culture, almost anything can attract interest, and big investor money, even if it seems to straddle the line between right and wrong or even reality and parody. ""This is irresponsible and sleazy and exactly what people hate about startups sucking the life out of San Francisco,"" Wired senior writer Mat Honan wrote of ReservationHop on Twitter. Creator Brian Mayer says he wrote the app, which is San Francisco-only for now, after waiting 30 minutes for a burrito. ""Is this even legal? Is it ethical? Restaurants are going to hate this!"" Mayer wrote in a blog post about the ""overwhelmingly negative"" response he's gotten. ""To be honest, I haven't spent a lot of time thinking through these questions. I built this site as an experiment in consumer demand for a particular product, and the jury's still out on whether it will work."" Complaints centered largely on two issues: making money off something that should be free and hurting restaurants by scooping up reservations that, if not purchased, could lead to empty tables and lost revenue. The going rate for a reservation on the site appears to be $12. After you pay, ReservationHop tells you the fake name to use. Mayer said that he's been able to cancel reservations that aren't purchased several hours in advance and that ""in the interest of ethics and fairness,"" he wants to talk to restaurants about working with them directly. Selling services that would otherwise be free has become something of a trend in the startup world. Several new parking apps let users in crowded neighborhoods post when they're about to leave a spot and charge someone for the opportunity to take it. San Francisco's city attorney has threatened to sue several of those startups, saying they break the law by selling what should be a public commodity. Not all apps raising eyebrows in Silicon Valley are so controversial. Some just shed light on the fact that almost any idea can draw investors with dreams of big payouts in what could be a new tech bubble ... or can at least have venture-capital-seeking creators firing off news releases in hopes of luring a shark. One, Washboard, wasn't long for this world. Its concept: selling you money for more money. Selling you quarters to do laundry, to be precise. For $27, the startup would mail you $20 worth of quarters. Washboard went under late last month, but not before raising the ire of some in the tech world. ""Probably smart,"" Valleywag's Sam Biddle wrote of the closure, which apparently came when the startup had drawn fewer than 10 customers. ""But at least they will be 'focusing (their) energy on something ultimately more worthwhile,' which would be anything. Literally anything. Lying down in the middle of the street and screaming would be ultimately more worthwhile than this."" Then there's Yo. The messaging app does one thing and one thing only. It lets you send the two-letter greeting, ""Yo!"" to a friend. No, that's not a parody (though it has inspired at least one. Yo, Hodor lets users similarly send a single word to friends, referencing the ""Game of Thrones"" character who speaks only his name). That idea? It raised $1.2 million from investors. And reportedly has more than 300,000 users. ""Let me stipulate that in the tech world anything with messaging is hot,"" wrote the Globe and Mail's Shane Dingman. ""Single-service apps are also hot. The surface of the sun is hot ... that's where I would like to fling myself rather than take Yo seriously."" There's no shortage of analysts speculating that this latest round of apps could be a sign that a tech bubble along the lines of the one that caused early Internet stars to crumble could be upon us. If nothing else, they predict, investors will soon sober up and put their cash into the Facebooks and Twitters of the world rather than vaguely defined startups. Which makes sense; it'll leave more money to buy their dinner reservations.","New startup made its creator ""the most hated person in San Francisco""

"(CNN) -- The body of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez will rest in a glass case on public display. Forever. At least, so said his deputy, Nicolas Maduro. While the idea may seem alien to some, Chavez will be the latest in a line of leaders whose remains have been embalmed and put on show in a glass casket. Perhaps the best known is Russia's Vladimir Lenin, whose body still lies in a mausoleum in Moscow's Red Square, nearly 90 years after his death. Others include Stalin, China's Mao Zedong, Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh, and North Korea's founding leader, Kim Il Sung. U.S. President Abraham Lincoln was also embalmed following his assassination in 1865, enabling his body to be taken on its winding, three-week train journey back to Springfield, Illinois, with open-casket memorial services along the way. For Nina Tumarkin, author of ""Lenin Lives! The Lenin Cult in Soviet Russia,"" the decision to embalm Lenin in 1924 -- the first modern leader to have his corpse preserved in this way -- was a reflection of a tumultuous period in early Soviet history. Chavez's impact lauded at funeral . ""Many people feared that the regime could not survive his death, so after the announcement was made, Moscow became something of an armed camp,"" said Tumarkin, a professor of Russian history at Wellesley College, Massachusetts. The leaders were unsure whether to hold a lying-in-state period, for fear that the people would not come, she said. As it turned out, some 750,000 braved the bitter January cold, standing in line for long hours to catch a glimpse of the corpse. As a result, the leaders decided to make it a ""going concern,"" she said, extending the period first to 40 days, the period in the Russian Orthodox tradition when Mass is said daily for the dead, and then installing his glass sarcophagus. They first placed it in a wooden mausoleum before building the stone one that stands today. Nine decades later and half a world away, crowds of Venezuelans similarly lined up to see Chavez's body as it lay in state at a military academy before the funeral Friday. So many came to see the body that the viewing was extended for another seven days. Giving details of his funeral, Maduro said Chavez would be embalmed ""just like Lenin (and) Mao Zedong"" and laid to rest at a military museum where generations of Venezuelans will be able to visit a man who for many was larger-than-life. Polarizing move . In Lenin's case, the decision was -- and is still -- controversial. Even at the time of the communist leader's death, many Russians were outraged by the idea of embalming him, Tumarkin said. Many more today would like to see the body buried. But the polarizing move came against the backdrop of the discovery 15 months earlier of the Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamen's tomb. ""It took the imagination of the world by storm,"" Tumarkin said, and it sowed the idea that the body of a leader could be preserved for thousands of years to come. It also tapped into a Russian Orthodox belief that the body of a true saint does not decay, she said. ""Most important from a political point of view, the leaders who followed Lenin at the time, or who would be competing for the mantle of general secretary of the party, were men who were really terrified that the whole system was going to come falling down,"" she said. That fear had already prompted them to begin the process of ""making Lenin eternal"" through his writings and portraits. With his extended lying in state, the Russian people also had a kind of shrine to visit, Tumarkin said, again channeling the religious tradition. When Lenin's body was put on display, the embalmers compared their work to that of the ancient Egyptians -- who actually had used very different methods -- and the message sent out to the rest of the world was that this should be seen as a demonstration of superior Soviet science, she said. At the same time, Lenin's symbolic presence lent the next generation of leaders an extra legitimacy, she said. And as the cult of Lenin swelled in the 1920s and 1930s, and was revived decades later, his body could still be viewed, Tumarkin noted. Other Communist leaders, such as Mao, followed his lead in later decades. Civil War practice . In some countries, for example the Philippines and the United States, embalming ahead of open-casket funerals is now quite common. But the process is still regarded with suspicion or revulsion by many, perhaps linked to a wider discomfort with the idea of death. According to the American Society of Embalmers, modern-day embalming took off in the United States during the Civil War, when families would travel to the battlefields to find their dead sons or brothers. ""The Union Army had 'Embalming Surgeons' in the battlefield that would prepare the remains, place them in a coffin and send back to the family by train or horse and buggy,"" the society's website says. So what's involved in the embalming process today? First, the body fluids must be drained and replaced with a formaldehyde-based product, said Richard Arnold, managing director of the Embalmer Training School in Britain and a qualified embalmer for 20 years. The formaldehyde-based fluid plasticizes the proteins within the body and fights against the bacteria that otherwise would lead to its decomposition, he said. In cases where the body is expected to remain embalmed for a long period -- rather than for a few weeks or months, as can happen if a funeral is delayed -- the concentration of formaldehyde will be increased. Other chemicals, such as lanolin, can be added to the mix to improve the color and texture of the skin, help break down blood clots or lessen discoloration. Then comes the process of making the deceased look as realistic and, for the sake of the family, as peaceful as possible, Arnold said. ""We do everything from reconstructive surgery to cosmetics and hairdressing."" The cosmetics used in embalming have higher levels of pigment and silicone, he explained, so that when the body is moved in and out of cold storage the cosmetics will expand and contract with the tissue beneath without cracking. Each embalmer works with individual artistry, he said, with many around the world creating their own mixes of chemicals to achieve the best results in local conditions. This could be important in Venezuela, where the weather is tropical and power supplies sometimes erratic. And if a body is going to be displayed for a long time, it's crucial to get it right. The body of Klement Gottwald, president of then-Czechoslovakia, was embalmed and placed in a mausoleum for display by Communist Party leaders in 1953. But it was taken off display several years later, in part because, it is said, it had begun to decompose. World leaders aside, Arnold believes embalming is an overlooked and undervalued art that helps regular people if someone dies far from home or must be laid to rest after a delay. Particularly for families who've lost a relative in sudden or tragic circumstances, it's important to see the loved one looking their best at the last, he adds. ""I've always enjoyed the job,"" he said. ""It's the last thing you can ever do for anybody."" 'Magic has gone' But even with the best of skill, an embalmed body will eventually start to look more waxy or plasticky -- as has been remarked of Lenin's face during his long repose. It reportedly is under a high-maintenance regime that involves the frequent reapplication of embalming fluids. Despite this, Lenin is no longer looking as good as he used to, said Tumarkin, who has viewed him several times over the decades in the gloom of his 1920s-style mausoleum, decorated in red, black and white. It used to make an impression in the Soviet period, when the long lines of visitors leading up to the sarcophagus created a sense of reverence akin to that of a pilgrimage, she said. But on more recent visits, Tumarkin found much has changed. ""You don't have that any more. You don't have the lines (of people) any more. You just wander in and it's like being in a wax museum -- the magic has long since gone."" It's perhaps a word of warning that Venezuela's leaders should heed as they plan for eternity.","Hugo Chavez's embalmed body is to be placed on display in a glass casket .

"(CNN) -- May 25, National Missing Children's Day, is a day on which we honor and remember missing children. This date was chosen specifically because it is the date in 1979 when 6-year-old Etan Patz went missing on his way to school in New York. The Patz case has resurfaced as a result of some potential new leads and an arrest that hopefully will result in the case finally being solved. I have the greatest respect and empathy for the parents of Etan, who are going through what is clearly one of the greatest nightmares any parent can experience -- never again seeing and not knowing what happened to one's own child. Just as the Lindbergh case in the 1930s became a landmark case for increased national awareness concerning ransom kidnapping, the Patz case became a landmark case for increased national awareness concerning ""stranger abduction."" Each of these cases played a major role in creating laws, but they also fueled some confusing stereotypes. When I joined the FBI in 1970 and someone talked about child abduction, you immediately assumed it was a ransom-motivated case. In less than 20 years, the attitude drastically changed to almost immediately assuming any child abduction involved a sexual predator. Either assumption is obviously not always correct. Because of his young age and other case factors, it can be reasonably assumed that Etan was most likely abducted. However, children can be missing for a wide variety of reasons (e.g., runaway, lost or injured, benign episode, family abduction) other than nonfamily abduction. Children can also be abducted by nonfamily members for a variety of reasons (e.g., to solve a personal problem, ransom/profit, to kill, miscellaneous criminal activity, political) other than sexual gratification. Most missing children are not abducted and most abducted children are not missing. The typical child abduction is a relatively brief event in which the child is usually returned before anyone had time to note the child was missing. The best research data we have indicate that only a very small percentage of missing children were abducted by a nonfamily member. Of these cases, most of the abducted children were teenagers. And of the nonfamily-abducted children, almost all of them were returned alive and relatively uninjured a short time later. Understanding that the terms missing and abducted are not synonymous and interchangeable is important in awareness and prevention efforts. In addition, sexually motivated nonfamily abduction is probably the only aspect of sexual victimization of children that people think occurs more often than it actually does. People tend to underestimate the likelihood that a family member or trusted acquaintance will sexually victimize their child, but overestimate the likelihood of stranger abduction. I am aware of no research that indicates that children today are any more likely to be abducted by sexual predators than they were 50 years ago. Many adults love to reminisce about an idealistic childhood during which they did not lock their doors and could play outside with no fear of abduction, but believe that today they cannot let their children out of their sight. However, nonfamily members abduct less than a few hundred children each year in a manner that fits our stereotypical image of an abducted and missing child. The danger of sexual victimization of children comes predominantly from family members and acquaintances, not strangers. On this important day, we should remember the reality of missing children such as Etan Patz, but not at the expense of ignoring or misunderstanding other types of victimization of our children. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kenneth V. Lanning.","May 25 is National Missing Children's Day, chosen because of Etan Patz .

"Washington (CNN) -- ""Excited"" after a meeting Thursday with Mitt Romney, tea party favorite Sen. Jim DeMint urged fellow Republicans to be realistic and rally around the party's eventual nominee, making his plea the same day the ex-governor's chief rival suggested voters would be as well off with President Barack Obama as they would Romney. In addition to fundraising events, Romney was in Washington to hold talks with DeMint as well as legislators from Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, which hold primaries next month. The legislators included House Budget Committee chairman Paul Ryan, according to GOP aides. ""I'm not only comfortable with Romney, I'm excited about the possibility of him possibly being our nominee,"" said DeMint, a well known conservative, claiming he was impressed by Romney but stopping short of giving him a full endorsement. Adding that ""I just think we just need to look at where we are,"" DeMint strongly suggested that rival candidates Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich should drop out to end the nomination fight and focus the party's efforts on defeating Obama in November. ""I just hope at some point they'll realize whether they can win or not,"" DeMint said of Romney's top opponents. ""If they can't, the best thing they can probably do is to help the one who is going to win."" This apparent call for unity contrasted sharply with the message offered Thursday by Santorum, who has been Romney's foremost challenger in large part thanks to support from conservative voters. The former Pennsylvania senator said in a San Antonio speech that the only way for Republicans to win was ""by giving people the choice ... not someone who is just going to be a little different than the person in there."" ""If we are going to be a little different, we might as well stay with what we have instead of taking a risk in what may be the Etch A Sketch candidate,"" Santorum said. He was referring to earlier comments from a top Romney adviser, Eric Fehrnstrom, who said his campaign will ""hit a reset button"" to take on Obama in the fall if Romney wins the GOP nomination. He added, ""It's almost like an Etch A Sketch. You can kind of shake it up, and we start all over again."" Romney quickly blasted Santorum's remarks, saying in a statement he was ""disappointed to hear that Rick Santorum would rather have Barack Obama as president than a Republican."" ""Any of the Republicans running would be better than President Obama and his record of failure,"" he added. In this swift retort, Romney was able to turn the tables on an opponent who, along with Gingrich, had sought to play up Fehnrstom's Etch A Sketch remarks for a second day. They said the adviser's remarks bring into question whether Romney will drop his conservative stances, some of which are different from others he'd taken earlier in his career, in favor of more moderate positions ahead of the general election. On Wednesday, Santorum's campaign posted a photo on Twitter of the candidate using an Etch A Sketch, saying it showed him ""studying up on (Romney's) policy positions."" A website unveiled Thursday by the Gingrich campaign features the Fehrnstrom quote above an Etch A Sketch that highlights Romney's policy shifts when viewers hit a prompt labeled ""shake."" Written on the drawing toy is ""Mitt's Etch A Sketch Principles."" ""You have this over-and-over process where he's pro-choice and then he's not pro-choice; he's pro-gun control then he's an NRA member who hunts varmints,"" Gingrich said of Romney at a campaign event Thursday in Houma, Louisiana. ""... If you're serious about changing Washington, D.C., you can't use an Etch A Sketch. You can't have a child's toy for a president."" On the Tea Party Nation website, blogger Judson Phillips wrote Thursday that the Etch A Sketch image ""is what conservatives have been warning about for months with Romney."" ""He is a liberal. He has no core convictions and as soon as he becomes the nominee, he will move far to the left,"" Phillips continued. Romney, who scored the prized endorsement of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush on Wednesday, explained the Etch A Sketch remark by saying, ""Organizationally, a general election campaign takes on a different profile."" ""The issues I am running on will be exactly the same,"" he said. ""I am running as a conservative Republican. I was a conservative Republican governor. I will be running as a conservative Republican nominee, at that point hopefully, for president. The policies and positions are the same."" The caricature of Romney as a politically motivated flip-flopper extends far beyond the Republican campaign and right-wing blogosphere. In an interview broadcast Thursday on Public Radio International, Obama said Romney was ""pretending"" the health care plan he helped institute as governor of Massachusetts differed from the national plan that Democrats in Congress passed two years ago. Santorum and other conservatives have repeatedly attacked Romney over the Massachusetts health care plan, while Romney says he never called for implementing such a program at the federal level. In the radio interview, Obama pointed to similarities between the two plans without mentioning the Republican front-runner by name. ""We designed a program that actually previously had support of Republicans, including the person who may end up being the Republican standard bearer and is now pretending like he came up with something different,"" Obama said. This week's Illinois result gave Romney at least 41 of the 54 delegates at stake in the contest to face off with Obama, increasing his total to 562, according to CNN's estimate. Santorum is second with 249, Gingrich third with 137 and Texas Rep. Ron Paul last with 69. A total of 1,144 delegates is needed to clinch the GOP nomination. Santorum said he expects to do better in coming primaries and caucuses, including Louisiana on Saturday. The former senator has made a strong showing in traditionally conservative Southern states, winning Alabama and Mississippi a week ago while Romney finished third. ""This is the last chance, in a sense, for the conservative area of the country to plant their flag, and we felt very good about what Alabama and Mississippi did,"" Santorum said in an interview Thursday with New Orleans radio station WWL. ""They restarted this race again."" Another Santorum victory in Louisiana would continue the pattern of the race, while a Romney win would signal growing support from the conservative base that he needs to finish off his rivals. Gingrich, who appears increasingly unlikely to mount another comeback after two previous campaign surges, said Thursday he is used to fighting from behind. ""Almost everywhere I've campaigned, because of the way of the money, we start behind and then we gain ground,"" Gingrich told about 100 supporters in Lafayette, Louisiana. CNN's Kevin Liptak, Kate Bolduan, Paul Courson, Ted Barrett, Shawna Shepherd and Chris Welch contributed to this report.","NEW: Rick Santorum says ""we might as well stay"" with Obama if Romney will be similar .

"(CNN) -- Comedian/actor Bill Hader has departed ""Saturday Night Live"" after eight seasons, but it's not like he's strapped for work. This Friday, Hader will be seen prominently in the raunchy summer comedy ""The To Do List"" opposite Aubrey Plaza, Rachel Bilson, Donald Glover and Scott Porter. The film comes from Hader's wife, writer/director Maggie Carey, so he's particularly close to this project. Later this summer, he'll reprise his role as the voice of Flint Lockwood in ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2."" CNN spoke with Hader about his Emmy nomination, why he's moving back to California and his take on humor's long shelf life. CNN: ""The To Do List"" is set in the early '90s, an era that a lot of people these days feel nostalgic about. What's funny to you about this time period? Bill Hader: I don't really know what's funny about it. Everything is so tech now; everyone is so connected that way. It's interesting in this movie that I have to tell Aubrey Plaza's character something, and I have to go to her house. Which you would never do now. The whole movie would be done in two seconds now. It was the last time when things were in that '50s vein. Now, if I leave my cell phone at the house, I assume my house is on fire. CNN: You play a slacker pool manager, but you yourself are not a slacker. Did you ever go through a stoner phase? Hader: No, I never did. I actually don't smoke pot that much. I've never been a big pot smoker. And when I do smoke pot, friends always say, ""I feel like I'm smoking pot with my dad."" I was always the designated driver; I never drank that much. Not out of some moral thing. It's that I wasn't that interested in that. I was more of the drinking coffee at the coffee shop crowd. Oddly enough, I wasn't a very good student. I didn't apply myself that well. I wasn't good at doing things I wasn't interested in. I used to think I was just slow, and a nice teacher said, ""oh, you're actually really smart, you don't give a s*** about anything."" CNN: Along with playing the lead, you're also billed as a producer. Are you looking to do more behind-the-scenes work in the future, like, say, Will Ferrell does? Hader: Yeah. I'd love to direct a movie. That's initially what I wanted to do. Acting was never something on my radar. I just did it as a fun extension of wanting to direct. I thought I should act to know what actors go through. I realized the acting thing really took. (Laughs.) CNN: Last week, the Emmy nominations came out, and it was the first time a male ""Saturday Night Live"" cast member has been nominated twice for ""Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series."" Have you been in a ""comedy sweet spot"" the last few years, the way a basketball player might get hot shooting three pointers? Hader: I don't know if it's that or ... I don't know. I try not to think about it too much, or I'll go crazy. I used to always think that there was a shelf life on being funny. But I work with (""South Park"" creators) Matt (Stone) and Trey (Parker), and their show is in its 16th season, and every season is funnier. They figure out new things to do. Martin Short, when he comes by (""Saturday Night Live""), he's still the funniest human being on the planet. Fred Willard still makes me laugh. All these people I liked growing up are still making me laugh. I try not to think about it too much in terms of myself. CNN: That's probably good. You need to get some sleep. Hader: It's not very healthy to think about yourself on those terms. You'll go nuts. Oddly enough, I have really bad stage fright -- getting up in front of people. And I made a living going on live television. CNN: Would you be paranoid about the reactions after, or was it more of a ""once it's done, it's done""? Hader: I'd be done with it. I've done sketches on the show -- I don't think I've ever finished anything and thought, ""oh, that was great."" I'm always like ""uhhhh ... Why didn't I do this?"" It's like a trap that I try to wiggle out of on-air. A mental trap. I prepare stuff so compulsively. I'm constantly rereading. I'm constantly rereading the sketch, going over it. So I know it so well, and if the slightest thing doesn't get a laugh, it used to throw me. Toward my last couple seasons on the show, I'd purposely do something I've never done before. Not so much say things but give a different look or pause differently. Something that my brain would say ""oh, you screwed up,"" and suddenly I would relax. Every Saturday morning, I'd wake up, and I'd immediately start pacing. I could not make my body stop moving. I thought if I stopped moving, it would sink in that I have to go on live television tonight. CNN: It seems like leaving ""Saturday Night Live"" might be good for your health. Hader: Yeah, good for my mental health. No, I say all this, but in the moment, when it's happening, it's actually fun. Especially if people are laughing. CNN: What was the conversation with Lorne Michaels like? How does someone resign from this iconic show? Hader: I went into his office in February, and I think he knew that I was going to move to California. That's what it was really about. We got a family, and I want a backyard. That's how it started. It was really just excruciating small talk and then getting into the issue of the leaving. Generally, Lorne said, ""I totally get it, you have a family. I would love it if you stayed, but I get it."" Around May, I said I wanted to announce it, and that's how it went. It definitely was hard. People will say that they cried. I thought I was going to pass out. When it was addressed and happened, it felt like a weight had been put on my shoulder or a weight had been lifted. All I know is that the room started tilting a bit. It was a physical reaction to saying the words ""I'm leaving."" It was crazy. I didn't have a career. I worked as an editor on ""Iron Chef: America"" before ""SNL."" It's the reason people know me. CNN: That's quite a jump, from ""Iron Chef: America"" to ""SNL."" Hader: It was scary. For four years, I was waiting for them to figure out they made a giant mistake. I still can't really believe it. CNN: Stefon has certainly entered the hall of fame of ""SNL"" characters. Was he your favorite? Hader: He was one of my favorites. Herb Welch, the reporter who was a real ****head, I loved playing him. What I liked about doing Stefon is that you could play it kind of subtle. It was right at the camera.","Bill Hader has a busy summer after his exit from ""Saturday Night Live""

"Istanbul (CNN) -- A central square and park in Istanbul erupted Tuesday and into Wednesday in an unsettling, chaotic chorus, with tear gas canisters and water cannons from police met by fireworks, metal banging and defiant chanting from protesters. The drama followed an ebb and flow of demonstrators all day from the Turkish city's Taksim Square and the abutting Gezi Park, where they've camped out for days, in response to the actions of riot police. It is all a continuation of demonstrations that first focused on the environment -- opposition to a plan to build a mall at the park -- but has evolved into a crusade against Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's allegedly authoritarian ways. On Tuesday, just before planned talks between Erdogan and protest organizers, there was no obvious resolution in sight. Certainly, neither side backed down in the latest round of clashes. Time and again, once the situation appeared to settle down, it flared up again. Right after midnight, for instance, government forces shot water cannons toward the park and toward streets adjacent to the square, and boom after boom of tear gas being fired could be heard. Around 2 a.m. Wednesday, a fresh wave of tear gas engulfed Gezi Park -- where government officials have said protesters can stay -- as a column of police broke through barricades on a side street nearby. The scene was frenzied with sirens blaring, people running, some even writhing in pain. The square itself, by then, was relatively calm. Bulldozers and dump trucks rolled in to clear debris, and fire engines put out flames from an excavator that had been set ablaze. Yet there is little suggestion that authorities will manage to douse the fury of protesters anytime soon. ""We want to be heard, respected ..."" a woman in Gezi Park told CNN on Tuesday night, explaining what she and other protesters are asking for. ""We're not vandals, we're not criminals."" Erdogan hasn't given any indication his government will alter its approach either. While he announced plans to meet with some protest organizers Wednesday, he also insisted, ""We will never allow people to push things to us."" In remarks Tuesday -- which came at a meeting in parliament of his own Justice and Development Party -- the prime minister directly addressed those opposing him on the streets of Turkey's biggest city. ""They say the prime minister is harsh. The prime minister is firm,"" Erdogan said. ""I'm sorry. The prime minister is not going to change."" 'The police are against me' For days, Taksim Square and Gezi Square have been hubs of activity by protesters decrying what they call an increasingly authoritarian government. Police made a concerted effort Tuesday morning to push them out -- including bringing in armored vehicles to shove away makeshift barriers set up by the demonstrators. Beyond the riot zone: Why Taksim Square matters to Turks . Several protesters linked arms to form a human chain and prevent the police advance. But when police deployed multiple canisters of tear gas, they scattered. ""If you stop throwing rocks, we will not use tear gas,"" the police told the raucous group over loudspeakers. ""We don't want you to get hurt; please obey."" In a game of cat-and-mouse, demonstrators -- some using wooden boards as shields -- would pull back only to return to spots in and around Taksim Square, lobbing Molotov cocktails and firecrackers and flashing ""victory"" signs. The situation escalated Tuesday evening when riot police stepped up their dispersal of tear gas canisters toward the square, which prompted tens of thousands to flee. Letters from Turkey, with pride . Many sought refuge in Gezi Park, where Erdogan's government had said it would allow protesters to remain as long as they were peaceful. Police moved along its edges but never entered, but they did set off panic when they fired tear gas canisters into the park's cramped confines multiple times Tuesday evening and again Wednesday morning. ""My eyes were burning, and my nose running and my face was also burning,"" said CNN iReporter Essam al-Ghalib, a former CNN producer from Saudi Arabia now living in Istanbul. ""The wind was blowing ... carrying the noxious gas all through the area as far away as a kilometer."" Protesters didn't stay away from Taksim Square for long. At one point, thousands packed back into it. Some surrounded a large bonfire they fueled with whatever they could find, as deafening bangs -- likely the result of stun grenades -- added to the turmoil. Deep into the night, the demonstrators dug in for a standoff. And not just in Istanbul. Police in the capital city of Ankara fired tear gas overnight Tuesday toward apparent protesters, as armored vehicles cleared makeshift barricades along the street, video from CNN Turk showed. The approach Tuesday marked an apparent return to the more heavy-handed tactics Turkish authorities used in the early days of the protests. Two protesters have been killed since the demonstrations began in late May. One was hit by a car in Istanbul; the other was shot in the head by unknown assailants in Antakya, near the Syrian border. Plus, a police captain died after falling from a bridge, according to the Adana governor's office. The Turkish Medical Association said that more than 4,300 people were injured in clashes last week, a few dozen of them seriously. The woman who spoke to CNN on Tuesday night from Gezi Park said that she's seen classmates, work colleagues and others who, like her, had never protested until now. She said many have been angered and energized by the government's response. Pointing to a mask she had around her neck to protect against tear gas, she added, ""This is how a violent person behaves."" Saban Disli, a member of parliament who belongs to Erdogan's party, acknowledged there are some ""peaceful demonstrators"" who, he claimed, ""are being used by terrorist groups."" He denied that the prime minister is authoritarian, accusing opposition parties and ""the international media"" of crafting a false image of Erdogan. ""This is not new Erdogan,"" Disli told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Tuesday night, saying the prime minister hasn't changed since he was mayor of Istanbul. ""This has never been new Erdogan."" Opinion: From victim to villain -- Erdogan's unfinished transformation . Erdogan defiant in face of opposition . Like Disli, the governor of Istanbul said Tuesday night that protesters from ""marginal groups"" attacked police and others. In remarks broadcast on Turkish television, Gov. Huseyin Avni Mutlu urged people to leave Taksim Square and vowed the government would take necessary measures until protesters leave. Speaking a short time later on CNN, Ibrahim Kalin -- chief adviser to Erdogan -- defended the police response, saying they acted like those authorities who faced mass protests in places like Spain, Greece and during the Occupy Wall Street movement in New York and elsewhere. Kalin acknowledged there are peaceful protesters, reiterating Tuesday night that Erdogan intends to meet with them. He said the government had made ""a clear distinction"" between them and members of what he called ""very marginal"" and, in some cases, ""very illegal groups that have tried to dominate the scene and occupy Taksim Square."" ""Peaceful protesters have been allowed to have their own demonstrations,"" Kalin said, adding that these people can remain in Gezi Park. ""Others have attacked the police with Molotov cocktails, sticks, whatever they can get. They are obviously not the peaceful protesters."" The volatile situation threatens Turkey's economy, including its tourism industry, and raises questions internationally. Bordering Syria, Iraq and Iran, Turkey a NATO member and a key U.S. ally. Yet recent events have caused ""concern"" in the United States, according to U.S. National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden. ""We are concerned by any attempts to punish individuals for exercising their right to free speech, as well as attempts by any party to provoke violence,"" Hayden said. ""We believe today's events reinforce the need to resolve this situation through dialogue."" Many Istanbul demonstrators who talked to CNN's Arwa Damon were young professionals who described themselves as apolitical but felt compelled to join the protest effort. Other generations are represented as well, like an older woman who raised her hand and yelled out, ""Tayyip, resign!"" when she walked past a CNN camera. Such demands for Erdogan to step down, and criticisms of him as a dictator, are ""completely false,"" according to Kalin. And whatever one's take on the situation, it is clear the prime minister has never been in a position like this in his and his party's decade in power. In speeches, Erdogan has said he has no tolerance for what he calls illegal demonstrations, slamming protesters and warning that ""even patience has an end."" ""All they do is destroy. They attacked public buildings; they burned public buildings. They burned the cars of civilians,"" he said. ""Let's face off at the ballot box in seven months. If you are saying democracy and freedom, if you are saying rights and freedoms, you cannot achieve that with violence. Only within the laws, you can achieve it."" Still, while few doubt Erdogan was legitimately elected, the unrest highlights the fact that he's not universally loved by Turks, despite the strong performance of the nation's economy during his years as prime minister. ""It is ... a democracy that is seeing deep splits between the one half that has voted for the governing party, and one half that does not,"" said Soner Cagaptay from the Washington Institute, a think tank focused on the Middle East and the United States. ""Despite its economic growth, (Turkey) is, politically, very deeply polarized."" What's driving unrest and protests in Turkey?

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- The phone call came from my uncle -- a captain on a superyacht -- offering me a seasonal job as a stewardess. Having absolutely no experience and no idea what the job would entail, where it would take me and how I would fare in rough conditions, I jumped at the chance. Within the week I had arranged my B1/B2 visa at the American Consulate, booked in the obligatory safety course ( S.T.C.W 95), had a medical, packed up the accumulation of goods a girl at 22 owns and flew across to the USA. I arrived just in time for the Miami Boat Show armed with a reckless dash of confidence, a hefty dose of enthusiasm and sea sick pills. Despite discovering that it is indeed true, one can turn a certain shade of green; what started as one season has now turned into six years of life working as a stewardess, and now chief stewardess, on superyachts. The industry is a curious one. Unless you have actually worked on a white boat it is near impossible to understand the life of a crew member. From an outsiders perspective cruising in a luxury floating hotel to glamorous and exotic locations on an all-expenses paid trip does indeed sound luxurious, amazing, and enviable. See also: Shipwreck hunters' mysterious finds . I am the first to admit it can be. As someone who has taken the plunge below deck, I can tell you, yachting is an industry of extreme highs and extremes lows. Yes you are indeed gracing the ports of Monte Carlo, Ibiza, Sardinia, Nice and St Barts but, in reality, the key sights are usually seen through a small round window not dissimilar from the sort you see on Playschool. Porthole tourism I like to call it. In season, rarely do you have the energy to tear yourself away from scrubbing the porcelain throne to take in the salty foreign air. An irregular heart beat from the Red Bull running through your veins, is a necessary hazard after 36 hours of ""yes siring"" to a plethora of demanding billionaires all whilst maintaining that smile on your dial. Check out Bonnie's website for more inside info . There really is no typical day onboard a superyacht. Workload and the sort of work changes depending on the season, whether you have guests on board and any maintenance issues. A superyacht requires never ending upkeep. The yacht needs to be kept in immaculate condition and the crew need always need to be prepared for any situation. Salaries on board a yacht are dependent on position, qualifications, yacht size, where the yacht is located and if is private or charter. In general, a slightly higher salary is offered if the yacht is private with the hope if you work on a charter that you will make up your salary with tips. A person in my position with experience can hope to make from $3500-$6000 a month, not including tips, while inexperienced crew can hope to earn around $2000-3000 a month. On a busy and successful charter yacht you can hope to make tips of around 5 to 15% of the cost of the charter per week divided amongst the crew. In recent years tips are not as extravagant as they once were but you can hope to make approximately $1000 USD a week in tips. With a busy charter yacht completing approximately 10 weeks of charter a season. Possibly the most extraordinary situation I experienced and -- we were totally unprepared for it -- came when the captain of the yacht I was working on fell sick and went into a coma. We were docked on an isolated island in the Bahamas and had no means of transport to get the captain and his distraught wife (who was also the chef on board) to the closest hospital. Luckily for us, a couple had just tied the knot on the beach near our boat and we had to hitch a ride with the newlyweds to a place where the captain and his wife could be airlifted out. See also: How to design a yacht fit for a Queen . In addition to this we had a charter load of guests flying in who were intending on joining us to cruise the Bahamas islands. We didn't have time to contact them to let them know we were now down a captain and a chef, had no time for provisions, no access to money, no way to steer the boat and not enough crew. We did, however, have champagne, a freezer full of lobster and some culinary skills between us. Somehow we managed to pull it off with some cruises around in our tender and made an attempt at gourmet meals. Thankfully the captain survived and was back at work after a couple of months. Working on a superyacht is very hard work; you have to be at the beck and call of guests who have some quite particular requests that are almost impossible to fulfill. One particularly challenging one was from a lady having a bad hair day who wanted a seaplane to take her from Alaska to a hair stylist in Canada! I've also had guests who pre-ordered 100 bottles of vodka for their week-long trip but polished it all off just days into their charter, they wanted me to somehow organize another 100 bottles of their luxury brand spirit from the middle of the ocean. There are the simple things too like making sure you have the language of choice newspapers and particular imported coffee and the preferred wine on hand at all times, from wherever you may be in the world. We had a particular diva celebrity who required full body make up every day before she left her cabin and a group of Ukrainian guests who brought with them suitcases full of pig lard to accompany their whiskey. Whatever the guests require it is our job to make sure they get it. Although we do everything in our power to provide them with a six star service, Mother Nature is not always so obliging. Encountering bad weather and rough seas is inevitable and makes trying to keep guests happy (and from vomiting) quite a challenge. See also: Is Middle East the new sailing hub? That aside, after serving, ironing, cooking, chamoising and putting up with bulimic supermodels, there is a real sense of triumph when you complete a two-week or two-month stint with guests on board a 24/7 running (and you are literally running) superyacht. It is times like these when you might just get a day or a night to explore the splendid ports of call all with a nice big gratuity in your pocket. These kind of opportunities are extraordinary and for that moment any trials you may encounter with the world's wealthiest whilst facing unruly seas, unpredictable weather and even more unpredictable and unruly guests, diminishes. For all the challenges yachting presents, I actually enjoy the rush, the work and the lifestyle (just don't ask me that after cleaning up after a boat full of sea sick guests!). I am grateful for the education I have received whilst contributing to running these superyachts and the opportunity to travel the world whilst saving my pennies.

"London (CNN) -- It reads like something from a spy novel. An MI6 agent known for his mathematical genius and codebreaking talent is found dead at his home, his naked body padlocked inside a large red carrying bag stowed in the bathtub. There is no sign of a break-in or of force having been used against him. The man's Internet history betrays an interest in sex games and bondage. But DNA traces suggest other people may have been in his apartment. The mysterious 2010 death of Gareth Williams, who worked for Britain's foreign intelligence service, is a riddle that has gripped the nation. And at the heart of the mystery is a key question: Could Williams have zipped himself into the bag as part of a bizarre sexual fantasy? Or was the Cambridge-educated math whiz placed there by what family members have suggested are killers versed in the ""dark arts"" of espionage? At Westminster Coroner's Court, a solid red-brick building across the River Thames from the headquarters of MI6 -- where fictional spy James Bond worked -- the disturbing tale of the final hours of a man known for closely guarding his privacy has unfolded in the most public of ways. The inquest has heard that Gareth Williams was not reported missing for more than a week, despite the sensitive nature of his work, meaning many vital clues were lost to decomposition. Meanwhile, UK media have focused on revelations about the 31-year-old's apparent interest in bondage and claustrophilia, a fetish for enclosure in very confined spaces. Reports about the ""body in a bag spy"" detail how two experts spent days trying to figure out whether Williams, who was athletic and of medium height, could have contorted himself in such as way as to lock himself into the North Face holdall bag, with a key to the padlock inside. Video provided to the court shows one of them, Peter Faulding, folding himself laboriously into an identical bag, measuring just 32 inches by 19 inches (81 by 48 centimeters), placed in a bathtub. Faulding, who specializes in rescuing people from confined spaces, told the inquest he had tried to lock himself into the bag 300 times without success, according to the Press Association news agency. A second expert witness, also of a size and build similar to Williams, tried 100 times to re-enact the feat without succeeding. But neither ruled out definitively the possibility Williams could have somehow done it alone. A small trace of someone else's DNA was found on the bag, helping spawn all kinds of theories -- that he was perhaps drugged by a foreign spy who then locked him in the bag, or was the victim of a kinky sexual liaison gone wrong. The detail that the closets in Williams' central London flat contained thousands of dollars' worth of designer women's clothing and shoes, some of which had been worn, as well as women's wigs and cosmetics, added fuel to the fire of speculation. Another revelation came from a former landlord and landlady, who told how they had once found Williams tied by his wrists to the headboard of his bed, after he shouted for help. Williams said he had wanted to see if he could get free, landlady Jennifer Elliot told the court, but she and her husband ""thought it to be more likely to be sexual than escapology,"" according to Press Association. Williams was recruited into the intelligence services straight from university, working with Government Communications Headquarters before MI6. The nature of his work and questions around why his spy agency bosses took so long to raise an alert about his absence have added to the intrigue surrounding his death. In a courtroom scene reminiscent of a spy thriller, his boss testified from behind a screen and was identified only as SIS F -- the Secret Intelligence Service being the official name for MI6. She apologized to Williams' family for the service's failure to act sooner, but said his lifestyle choices were not a concern for the agency, suggesting it has moved on from the rigid mores of past decades, when closet homosexuality or illicit affairs opened up possibilities for blackmail. ""There is no set template for what their lifestyle should be,"" SIS F said of today's intelligence agents, according to the Press Association. ""Individuals have lifestyle and sexual choices and sexual preferences which are perfectly legitimate."" She acknowledged that Williams had made a number of unauthorized computer searches at work but played down the significance of this fact, the agency said. Williams was finally reported missing by a co-worker on August 23, more than a week after the normally punctilious employee had last shown up at work. A transcript of the call to police said Williams was last spoken to on Friday, August 13, and that calls to his home number and cell phone had gone unanswered. His sister had also been unable to reach him. The caller mentioned that Williams had ""recently been pulled off of a job"" and said it was unclear if he might have ""taken this badly."" The family's lawyer accused MI6 of showing ""total disregard for Gareth's whereabouts and safety"" before he was found dead at his government-provided home, Press Association reported. Concerns over national security have been a factor in the 20-month delay in holding Williams' inquest, and an agency more used to working in the shadows has had an uncomfortably bright light shone into its practices. As well as adding to his family's distress, the initial delay in reporting Williams' death means forensic specialists simply cannot answer many of the most pressing questions. Testing did not give conclusive results because the body had decomposed significantly after nine days in the summer heat of his top-floor apartment, toxicology reports posted online say. Traces of alcohol and a chemical matching the party drug GHB were found, but both can occur naturally as part of the decomposition process, one document says. Williams was teetotal, so ""even a small amount of alcohol could affect cognitive capacity,"" it notes. A series of photographs provided by the Metropolitan Police show the tidy, impersonal interior of the spy's Pimlico home and the small, white-tiled bathroom where his body was found. A bicycle parked in the hallway is a clue to Williams' more regular passion, cycling. A glimpse through the bedroom door shows a bed half-made, clothes lying on it. But little else can be gleaned from the images. Media reports have homed in on expert testimony that despite Williams' solitary lifestyle, tiny traces of DNA from ""at least two"" other people were found in his apartment. But who those visitors were and whether they hold the clue to the riddle of the agent's mysterious death are yet more questions that remain unanswered. Williams' family, with whom he was close, deny that he was gay or had a secret, unorthodox sex life. They believe someone else was there either when Williams died or afterward, their lawyer, Anthony O'Toole, told a hearing held before the inquest began, and they suspect some degree of expert cover-up was involved. ""The impression of the family is that the unknown third party was a member of some agency specializing in the dark arts of the secret services -- or evidence has been removed post-mortem by experts in the dark arts,"" O'Toole said, according to Press Association. The inquest court is expected to give its verdict on Williams' death this week, but the final chapter of his life in the shadows may never be fully revealed to his family, or the British public.","Gareth Williams' naked body was found in a locked bag in the bathtub of his London home .

"(CNN) -- Everybody knows the big-time accounts on Twitter belong to celebrities -- the Katy Perrys and Justin Biebers and Lady Gagas. And those are just the singers with more followers than President Barack Obama. But as the newly public social platform rolls out to investors Thursday, we're taking a look at the surprise stars of Twitter -- the accounts you might not expect to be nestled in the top 200 most followed, alongside the likes of Oprah Winfrey and Adele. Some come from the ranks of the quasi-famous, those who have parlayed a smaller share of the spotlight into social media stardom through their activity on Twitter. Others have backgrounds that have put them in the public eye in other ways. And some aren't people at all. On Twitter, you can do that. Maybe you've never heard of them, or maybe you have. But all are examples of the power of Twitter, when used well, to enhance celebrity and amplify one's voice. Here are 10 of Twitter's most unexpected stars. Let us know your favorite noncelebrity Twitter celebrities in the comments. (Note: The rankings and follower numbers used come from the tool TwitterCounter.) One Direction . OK, this entry kind of goes against the grain of the rest. But we couldn't figure out how One Direction shouldn't be first. If you're not a preteen girl, or a preteen guy who listens to music he doesn't like to be around teen girls, you may well not even know that One Direction exists. But it does. And the group kind of owns Twitter. One Direction is a band of young lads from England. They're, by all accounts, dreamy. And they have six of the most popular accounts on the site. Singer Harry Styles checks in at No. 22, with 17.4 million followers -- more, even, than the 16 million following the band's official account. The other four band members rank 29th, 35th, 38th and 53rd, each of them with more than 11 million followers of their own. In contrast, the Beatles have the 969th most popular Twitter account. Of course, Ringo Starr doesn't log on to share observations like ""A little party never killed nobody,"" either. Facebook . We find something amusing about the fact that Twitter's chief rival, Facebook, is among the top 50 most popular Twitter accounts. But when you have more than 1.1 billion users, maybe it makes sense that folks want to keep up on their favorite social media site while ... well ... visiting their other favorite social media site. Facebook's nearly 12 million followers put it at No. 44. But this interloping is nothing new. In the earliest days of Google+, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was its most popular member. Paulo Coelho . You wouldn't think a revered Brazilian novelist would be satisfied with writing 140 characters at a time. But Coelho, whose 1988 novel, ""The Alchemist,"" has sold more than 30 million copies, is an active user with more than 8.7 million followers (No. 83). ""Twitter, I think, is an art,"" Coelho told The Guardian this year. ""Because if you're connected to people you learn how to (summarize)."" Works for us. Dalai Lama . There's probably not anyone in the world who would be more humble about having 8 million followers, right? The exiled Tibetan spiritual leader account is No. 91 on Twitter. And whether he personally writes the posts or not, they come off to anyone who has heard him speak as his authentic voice and tone. Consider this account a nice palate cleanser after reading where Kim Kardashian went shopping last night. Ramalan Indonesia . Apparently astrology is a big deal in Indonesia. This account, which awkwardly proclaims itself ""The LARGEST ASTROLOGY in the WORLD,"" has 7.2 million followers, good for No. 110 on the Twitter list. As best we can tell, this is a Twitter feed, written in Malay, that's the basic equivalent of those one-line horoscopes you get in the daily paper. (Note to fellow Libras: Apparently, it's OK if we're distracted at work today. We might have a cold.) Stephen Fry . Stephen Fry is famous. But you wouldn't think he'd be this famous -- twice as many followers as Jamie Foxx. The British actor and writer, whose credits range from ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" to cult favorites ""Black Adder"" and ""Doctor Who,"" is a perfect fit for the site -- its 140 characters just enough to share his dry wit. Or pictures of malformed M&Ms. Either way, he's got 6.3 million followers, landing at No. 131. Queen Rania . ""A mum and a wife with a really cool day job."" Well, yes, if being the queen of Jordan is a really cool day job. It's not every day you find royalty on networking sites. But she's answered questions from followers online and told interviewers that sites such as Twitter can be used to achieve real social change. With nearly 3 million followers (No. 456), it seems to be working. Pattie Mallette . How does a Canadian mom end up with 2.7 million Twitter followers, making her account the site's 554th most popular? Well, naming your son Justin Bieber helps. In addition to helping promote her famous son, Mallette talks about her projects, including an autobiography, and offers encouragement to teen mothers such as herself (she was 17 when Bieber was born). Jack Dorsey . What's a guy got to do to crack the top 600 around here? Dorsey was one of Twitter's founders and has racked up 2.4 million followers. But come on. That only makes him No. 643 on his own site. (We'd hate to think how Evan Williams and Biz Stone feel. They've got even fewer followers.) The Dark Lord . Who says good always triumphs over evil? We scoured Twitter for Harry Potter, and the boy wizard is nowhere to be found. (No, the official movie account doesn't count.) Meanwhile, Lord Voldemort is doing just fine for himself, thank you, with more than 2.2 million followers (No. 725). This is a parody account, so there are no official ties with creator J.K. Rowling, the books or the movies. But we're OK with that. It lets him be even meaner.","The majority of the most-followed Twitter accounts are singers and other celebrities .
But less-famous users have amassed big followings as well .
Rival Facebook has Twitter's 44th most popular account .
Horoscopes, a queen and Lord Voldemort also have huge followings ."
"New York (CNN) -- When I tell people our cat takes an antidepressant, I usually get a funny look. I might as well add that I worship Snoopy, am romantically involved with a Carvel ice cream cake (let's call it Cookiepuss), and drive a car that I knitted myself out of gnu fur. Putting your pet on psychotropic medication tends to suggest to others that it is you, not your cat, who needs help. To be fair to those I told this to, who perhaps thought my husband and I were escaped mental patients, I would have thought the same thing a few years ago. Before she lived with us, our cat Minou resided in a garbage area. After we adopted her, every time we went away, Minou would succumb to extreme urinary tract infections, at which point through no fault of her own our whole apartment morphed into one big litter box. Antibiotics, and even surgery, failed to address this problem. Finally, after a particularly aggressive infection that spread to the cat's kidneys, our vet recommended the happy pills. ""She is internalizing her anxiety and it is affecting her bladder,"" he explained. ""She thinks when you leave the apartment, you're leaving forever. She thinks she's going back to the dump."" By this time, I was several thousand dollars worse off, maxed out on pet insurance and had spent four disconcerting days watching Minou refuse to eat or move. Any remaining reservations I had about forcibly medicating an animal went out the window. So I fed Minou happy pills. Several months later, after the amitriptyline the vet had prescribed had truly taken hold, Minou was a noticeably different beast. Departure-related hysteria, puddle creation and the delightful nights of screeching all subsided. We felt guilty about forcing pills down her throat, which she often tried to hide and then spit out. But we were relieved that she wasn't getting sick anymore, though she did seem floppier. Apparently, our situation is not all that rare. Dr. Nicholas Dodman, founder of the Tufts Animal Behavior Clinic, said many animal dysfunctions mimic human psychological issues. Excessive grooming can be a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder, aggression and violence can indicate anxiety, and a refusal to eat can suggest depression in an animal. As with humans, these behaviors often can and should be first treated by adjusting the animal's environment and behavior. But animals don't speak, and they can't lie on a therapist's sofa plumbing painful puppyhood/kittenhood memories for the roots of their neuroses, so there are limits to the scope of therapy for them. Additionally, some issues are rarely treatable except with drugs -- for example, ""urine-marking"" in cats or thunderstorm phobia in dogs. Dr. Susan Nelson, professor for primary care at Kansas State University Veterinary Health Center, said many pets' troubles can be traced to human owners. We trap them in our homes, expose them to fireworks or force them to live with other animals they may intensely dislike. To you they may be Cuddles and Hector; to them it might be Rush Limbaugh and Bill Maher. The question of what kinds of feelings animals have and whether those feelings can, or should, be effectively treated with medication is, as you might imagine, controversial. Dodman said that while it's fairly evident that animals experience primary emotions such as fear, what has been more hotly debated is whether they have secondary emotions like jealousy and guilt. Those require the animal to have a sense of its own existence. It's easy to laugh at the idea of Fido taking an antidepressant and to dismiss owners who medicate their pets as urban nut cases who probably also kit their pooch out in Alexander McQueen sweaters and tote them around in a Birkin bag. But I think it's a huge disservice to animals to discount a medicated approach. I don't believe Minou thinks like a person, that she feels self-conscious about her saggy undercarriage or remorseful about waking me up by meowing in my face. But I know she was unhappy. Antidepressants may not be a cure-all for every ailment or behavioral issue, but they're a step to discuss with your vet if you're at the end of your leash. ""If you're really stuck and on the point of surrender,"" Dodman said, ""Don't give your animal up before you try a course of medication."" I agree. If all else fails, you may have to put aside your inner skeptic, swallow your pride and have your pet swallow some happy pills.

There are good reasons that Bieber's lawyers could reject a plea deal and demand a jury trial for the drunken driving charge in Miami, according to a Florida lawyer familiar with the case. Lawyers sometimes beat the charge in court. A lawyer can defend a DUI charge by focusing on the technical aspects of the arrest and testing, questioning whether police did everything right, attorney Michael Salnick told CNN. If problems or deficiencies are found in what law enforcement did, those issues could be challenged. Was there probable cause for police to stop the singer's Lamborghini? GPS tracking data suggests the sports car was not speeding in the minutes before the arrest. If the judge lets a jury hear that, it might create reasonable doubt about the police officer's claim he stopped Bieber and friend Khalil Sharieff after seeing them drag racing on a residential street. Was there probable cause for the officer to test Bieber's sobriety? The arresting officer said he became suspicious because he smelled alcohol on the singer's breath, but lab tests later showed the alcohol level in his system was well below Florida's legal limit for drivers under the drinking age of 21. Bieber's lawyer could argue that the officer made it up to justify the arrest. His defense might be bolstered if the judge allows the officer's disciplinary record to be used to challenge his credibility. While the alcohol level was below the legal limit, a preliminary toxicology report on Bieber's urine sample said he tested positive for ""metabolite of THC,"" which indicates marijuana use, and alprazolam, the generic name for the prescription sedative Xanax. ""Yeah, we were smoking all night at the studio,"" the singer told a police officer who told him he ""reeked of marijuana,"" according to police documents. No-risk trial in Florida . Defendants sometimes accept plea deals because they fear a judge would impose a tougher sentence if they were convicted in a trial. That's not a risk with Florida's DUI law, Salnick said. A judge would not give a sentence any different than what a prosecutor might offer in a plea deal, but a plea deal might allow the DUI charge to be kept off the defendant's criminal record, replaced by reckless driving, he said. Probation rules -- including a drug-testing requirement -- would be the same. So, why go to trial? An acquittal would be Bieber's only way to avoid probation and drug testing, short of persuading the Miami prosecutor to drop the case, Salnick said. The prosecutor in Miami has not discussed a plea agreement with Bieber's lawyer, Ed Griffith, a spokesman for the Miami-Dade state attorney's office told CNN Tuesday. ""It's way too early to offer a plea deal, if one was to be offered."" Bieber could choose the DUI diversion program that is available to all first-time offenders, Griffith said. It would last between six and nine months with random drug testing, about $1,000 in fines and fees, 40 hours of community service, an alcohol education class. In addition, Bieber would have to attend a session in which victims of DUI wrecks tell their stories. ""There are 11 stories presented by real victims and sometimes defendants who relay their experiences,"" a description of the three-hour session said. ""There is a quiz at the end, and the defendant has to score 100 percent prior to completion."" Deal or no deal, first-time offenders rarely go to jail if convicted of drunken driving in Florida, Salnick said. Bieber is likely not facing jail, unless he violates probation -- such as by failing a drug test. A trial had been scheduled to start next Tuesday, but instead a ""sounding"" hearing will be held with lawyers talking to the judge about preparations for a trial. Toronto assault charge . Bieber's best resolution of an assault charge in Toronto may be a plea deal that includes a ""diversion"" plan, according to a Canadian lawyer interviewed by CNN. ""If he goes to trial, he probably would be convicted,"" said attorney James Morton, a past president of the Ontario Bar Association. ""The Canadian system's conviction rate is extraordinarily high."" Just 3.5% of all defendants who plead not guilty and go to trial are acquitted, he said. Bieber allegedly struck his limousine driver on the back of his head several times while driving to a Toronto nightclub in December. Toronto prosecutors are likely already talking to Bieber's lawyer about a plea deal with a ""conditional discharge,"" in which the case would not be prosecuted if he takes part in anger management and community service, Morton said. It's the likely result for a young person without a criminal record who is not a celebrity, he said. Prosecutors will be under ""intense scrutiny"" and will want to avoid a deal that ""looks like they're favoring a famous Canadian star,"" he said. The first court hearing is set for March 10, but Bieber does not have to be there. A magistrate will hold several hearings over the next few months to make sure the prosecution has handed over all of its evidence, including statements and any video, to the defense before the case is assigned to a judge for trial, Morton said. California egg probe . Bieber faces a possible vandalism charge in connection with eggs tossed at his neighbor's home last month, which caused an estimated $20,000 damage to a Calabasas, California, mansion. The egging case is what lawyers call a ""wobbler."" The Los Angeles County district attorney's office could prosecute it as a misdemeanor or a felony under California law. It is up to the prosecutor to decide how serious the case is, based on a defendant's criminal history and other circumstances. A prosecutor has had the results of the sheriff's investigation for almost three weeks, and a decision could come soon. A felony vandalism conviction could bring up to three years in prison and a $50,000 fine. The maximum penalty for a misdemeanor conviction is a year in the county jail and a $50,000 fine. A felony conviction could also limit Bieber's ability to work in the United States, because he is a Canadian citizen with a work visa. Investigators searched his $6.5 million home last month, seizing the security video. Detectives gave the district attorney video clips identified from the night of the egg attack to use in the prosecution of Bieber. Another video recorded by the neighbor was also provided to investigators. Flying high? The Federal Aviation Administration is looking into allegations that Bieber and other passengers onboard a charter flight from Canada to New Jersey's Teterboro Airport on January 31 interfered with the flight crew, the agency said. Bieber and his father were ""extremely abusive verbally"" to the flight attendant on the Gulfstream IV aircraft as he traveled to attend the Super Bowl, according to a law enforcement sources. Both Biebers refused a pilot's repeated warnings to stop smoking pot on the flight, according to a report by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which was read to CNN. The FAA has not said when its investigation will conclude. CNN's John Couwels contributed to this report.","Bieber's Miami DUI case could be headed to a trial, lawyer says .

"(CNN) -- It all started with Madonna -- the original Madonna -- and the 16th-century Italian artists who paid tribute to her with chalk and pastel artwork they drew directly on the street. Madonnari, as the artists came to be called, made a living traveling from town to town and collecting coins from people who admired their work. It was the visual arts equivalent of busking, and the tradition continued until World War II, when, for obvious reasons, it became impractical to sit in the middle of a street and create art. After the war, the art of the Madonnari languished, but before it could die out completely, a group in the city of Curtatone, Italy, decided to revive it. The first I Madonnari festival in Curtatone, in the province of Mantova (Mantua), was held in 1973, with some of the prewar Madonnari among the participating artists. And that was the catalyst for a new generation of ""street painters"" who travel from city to city, and festival to festival, creating chalk artwork that hardly lasts longer than the handful of days required to make them. Discover the world's most visited museums . Typically, a chalk art or ""street painting"" festival has separate categories for ""copyists,"" who reproduce famous paintings; ""free artists,"" who create original two-dimensional works; and 3-D artists, whose work may be realistic or fantastical. Many festivals also make room for children, teens and amateurs. The wonder of these works of art is the way they materialize before the eyes of the onlookers. ""First, there was nothing,"" said Denise Kowal, founder of the Sarasota Chalk Festival, which will take place in November. ""Now, there is this art. And you watched it happen."" In truth, the art does not spring into existence overnight. It is carefully planned by the artists, who arrive with preliminary sketches and paintings that they will turn into large-scale pieces. Where they work is also carefully planned by the festival organizers, who provide them with precisely measured spaces in which to create their work. Even the pavement is a consideration, as every patch and crack makes a difference when the asphalt is your canvas. ""The quality of the street determines the clarity of detail in the work,"" Kowal said. Here are some of the world's top chalk art festivals that prove where the sidewalk ends, the art begins. Victoria International Chalk Art Festival, Victoria, British Columbia . September 14 and 15 . Now in its second year, this festival was inspired by local chalk artist Ian Morris, who has plied his trade on Government Street in Victoria for more than a decade. He will be joined by a roster of international artists including Dutch artist Leon Keer, renowned for his 3-D surrealist chalk art; California artists Lori Escalera and Joel Yau; Oregon artist Cathy Gallatin; and Toronto-based artist Jo Lalonde, better known as the ""Chalk Chick."" Festival Bella Via, Monterrey, Mexico . October 11 to 13 . Italy might have given birth to the Madonnari, but Mexico's tradition of street painting/chalk art is just as strong. ""Some people don't go to museums, so we make public spaces a place for creativity and art,"" said Rosy Loyola, the festival's director. Equally important is the festival's commitment to fostering young artists. Among standouts to watch for are Veronica Violeta GonzÃ¡lez Garza, Carlos Enrique Robledo Moreno, Margarita Botello and Omar Saenz. Parque Mirador Asta Bandera will be the venue when this festival celebrates its 10th anniversary this fall. Sarasota Chalk Festival, Sarasota, Florida . November 13 to 18 . Since its inception in 2007, the Sarasota Chalk Festival has expanded in size and scope. (This year, it will add two more blocks around Burns Square.) It has also expanded the definition of what chalk art is and can be. So, for example, the ""Going Vertical"" segment of the event incorporates walls and buildings in addition to pavement art. You can also expect to see the world's top 3-D chalk artists, such as Tracy Lee Stum and Kurt Wenner, who is credited with inventing the 3-D form. This year's festival overlaps with the Crystal Classic Master Sand Sculpting Competition in nearby Siesta Key Beach. Sand sculpture shindigs: A bucket list . Street Painting Festival, Lake Worth, Florida . February 22 and 23, 2014 . Celebrating its 20th anniversary in 2014, this festival is known as an incubator for emerging artists and a showcase for outstanding local artists, such as Michael Las Casas and Jeanie Burns, who have gained international reputations. About 400 artists -- from children and amateurs to professionals -- will participate this year, creating 200 works of art. I Madonnari Italian Street Painting Festival, Santa Barbara, California . May 24 to 26, 2014 . One of the oldest chalk art festivals outside Europe, this one has been going strong since 1987, attracting more than 100 artists and thousands of visitors each year. The festival takes place in the plaza outside the Mission Santa Barbara, appropriate for an event with a heritage in religious art. Proceeds benefit the Children's Creative Project, an arts education initiative in Santa Barbara County. International Street Art Festival, Wilhelmshaven, Germany . August 2 and 3, 2014 . The North Sea port city of Wilhelmshaven in the Lower Saxony region is well-placed to attract a diverse contingent of international artists. Though the number of participants is small (about 35 to 40 in 2013), the work is outstanding and includes top names such as Germany's Frederike Wouters and Italy's Vera Bugatti. Next year will be the festival's fourth year. Geldern Strassenmaler, Geldern, Germany . August 16 and 17, 2014 . The first Strassenmaler (""street painter"") festival in Geldern, Germany, took place in 1979 to commemorate the city's 750th anniversary. Sixty artists participated. In its 35th year in 2013, the festival welcomed more than 400 artists from around the world who created nearly 250 artworks at the end of August. The top artists compete for prize money with their original artwork, copies of the Old Masters or religious subjects. Fiera delle Grazie, Curtatone, Italy . Mid-August (likely) 2014 . This is the festival that started them all, and now approaching its 42nd year, it's still the most prestigious in the world. Expect about 200 artists to participate, creating original 2-D and 3-D artwork as well as reproductions of famous religious artworks. As of this writing, 2014 dates have not been announced; the festival coincides with the Feast of the Assumption in mid-August. I Madonnari Italian Street Painting Festival, San Luis Obispo, California . September 2014 . Like its sister festival in Santa Barbara, this one was inspired by the Italian Madonnari street painters, yet much of the artwork is contemporary and done in the bright, bold colors that have come to distinguish the California style of street painting. Artists ranging from amateur to expert will carpet the plaza at the Mission San Luis Obispo with their work. Chalk Urban Art Festival, Sydney, Australia . 2014, to be determined . This festival took a hiatus in 2013 so the organizers could work on a documentary film about chalk art. They hope to bring it back in 2014.","Sixteenth-century Italian artists did street artwork as a tribute to Madonna .

"(CNN) -- As I write this from the breakfast bar in my house, I just now finished eating a Lean Pocket for lunch. And it was awesome. Those delicious, microwavable little bastards complete me. But, despite the fact that this particular food-like product does, in fact, emphasize the word ""lean,"" I didn't actually eat it because I'm concerned about my weight. I ate it because I have embarrassingly low standards. Tonight's dinner: Something edible. Fortunately, I live alone and, unless my dog's palate suddenly shifts from Beggin' Strips as the gold standard for fine cuisine, there's really nobody here to judge me. Nevertheless, Lean Pockets do claim, at least by name alone, to be somewhat easy on the waistline. Which is a good thing, because, according to a new trending study, heterosexual women may be more attracted to men who are thin. Not surprisingly, 9 out of 10 belts agree. Though, to be fair, that 10th belt is really kinky and likes being dominated. ""Yes! Yes! Stretch me to the limit! Oh, it hurts so good! Now burn me with your cigarette!"" ""Whoa, belt. That just got weird."" The study, first published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B and later reported in LiveScience, quickly became a popular read throughout the Internet after it sort of debunked the idea that most women are instinctively drawn to guys who posses ""evolved"" macho features. Or what you might call PBM: Protective Boyfriend Material. This, of course, doesn't necessarily mean that ladies aren't attracted to masculinity, but the recent findings by Vinet Coetzee of the University of Pretoria in South Africa simply suggest women might subconsciously focus first on a man's weight -- or lack thereof -- before rejecting him for other reasons. Unfortunately, the finer details of the study get fairly complicated beyond that. But somehow it all oddly boils down to the strength of a man's immune system. Apparently, somewhere in a woman's brain -- most likely in a weird, strategic spot that blocks her ability to care deeply about the importance of a baseball player's on-base percentage -- there's a little chunk of gray goo that instantly determines whether or not a man's genes are worthy enough to pass on to future generations. For example, the average heterosexual woman's brain will make the following immediate determinations: . Channing Tatum: Mate. Now.Seth Rogen: Proceed with caution.Carrot Top: Run like hell. And immunity, the study says, has long been considered a major factor in these immediate genetic determinations. So, tying this back to the importance of being thin, Coetzee explains, ""We found that a man's weight serves as a better indicator of the relationship between immune response and attractiveness than masculinity does. It is therefore more likely that Latvian women use weight, rather than masculinity, in their subconscious judgments of a man's immunity."" The interesting word there is ""Latvian."" I don't really know if it matters or not that the female lusting tendencies of a small Baltic country of just over 2 million people have the honor of speaking for women all over the planet, but, alas, that's who they used for the study. And I approve. They seem nice. Besides, where else should they have done their research? Florida? ""According to our results, all women instantly swoon for a man in jorts.""

"(EW.com) -- Turtle Power does exist after all. The heroes in a half shell surpassed industry and analyst expectations by more than $20 million, raking in an estimated $65 million in its first weekend in theaters. With an additional $28.7 million from 19 international territories, ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"" which cost $125 million to produce, has earned $93.7 million globally. No wonder Paramount has already announced plans for a summer 2016 sequel. The Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon Movies pic may not have resonated with the critics, but that didn't seem to matter much to its target audience: kids. While moviegoers overall slapped the Michael Bay-produced movie with a lackluster B Cinema Score, kids were much more enthusiastic, giving it an A overall. Audiences on the whole were mostly male (61 percent) and a significant portion (45 percent) were under 25 years old. EW: Box office update: 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' rocket to No. 1 . ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" took second place with $41.5 million, falling an expected 56 percent from its blockbuster debut. For comparison's sake, ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" and ""Thor:The Dark World"" fell 57 percent in weekend two, while ""Iron Man 3"" fell 58 percent. ""Guardian""s has grossed $175.9 million in its first 10 days and could turn out to be one of the highest grossing films of the year. Disney and Marvel's sci-fi space opera is also doing quite well internationally: Its worldwide total is $313 million, with debuts in France, Spain, Germany, Italy, Japan, and China still to come. Warner Bros.' disaster flick ""Into the Storm"" (Cinema Score: B) opened at No. 3 with an estimated $18 million from 3,434 screens. It's not a stunning debut, but it's in line with expectations for the $50 million movie on a crowded weekend, which bumped earnings up 16 percent overall from the box office take a year ago. Disney's ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" (Cinema Score: A) opened a bit ahead of studio estimates with an estimated $11.1 million at 2,023 locations. The $22 million pic starring Helen Mirren can be expected to hold nicely over the next few weeks given the high Cinema Score and the tendency of older moviegoers not to rush out to see new releases on opening weekend. Audiences for the movie this weekend were 59 percent female and 42 percent over age 50. EW: 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' sequel set for 2016 . ""Lucy"" managed to edge out ""Step Up All In"" for the final spot in the top five with an estimated $9.3 million in its third weekend. Still playing at 3,147 North American locations, the Scarlett Johansson-led actioner also crossed the $100 million mark worldwide, thanks to this weekend's $15 million from 15 international territories. ""Step Up All In"" (Cinema Score: B+) grossed an estimated $6.6 million from 2,702 theaters—the weakest debut in the five-film franchise, which has earned more than $600 million at the worldwide box office. Lionsgate's Summit Entertainment is handling distribution on this installment, which has also already made $37.7 million internationally (with $6.4 million of that this weekend). The top five: . 1. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles — $65 million (new) 2. Guardians of the Galaxy — $41.53 million (domestic total: $175.9 million) 3. Into the Storm — $18 million (new) 4. The Hundred-Foot Journey — $11.12 million (new) 5. Lucy — $9.3 million ($97.4 million domestic total) Finally, in limited release, Daniel Radcliffe and Zoe Kazan's indie romantic comedy ""What If ""(Cinema Score: A-) grossed an estimated $130K from 20 screens, with its expansion continuing next weekend.

"(CNN) -- For first-timers, South by Southwest Interactive can be a little intimidating. The Austin technology festival, which kicks off Friday, swelled to nearly 20,000 participants last year. This year, there'll be more than 1,000 panels and presentations spread across 15 campuses in an increasingly crowded downtown. Surviving is one thing, but really experiencing and enjoying the fest often depends on what you bring, and just as importantly, don't bring. Here's some advice on what to equip yourself with and what to ditch before you hit SXSW. Bring: A game plan. The Interactive schedule is daunting, and that's not even counting nighttime parties and unofficial gatherings. It pays to go through the schedule on the official site and also to skim it on sites such as lynrd.com and sched.org, or sxshhh.com, a new paid site that for $5 rounds up RSVP info for SXSW-adjacent parties. Make a tentative plan for what you want to see and have it handy in a phone or online calendar you can access at any time during the fest. The official app of the fest, ""SXSW Go,"" is available for iOS, Android and soon Windows and BlackBerry phones. I find the iPad version is the easiest to browse through, more so even than the SXSW website itself. It doesn't hurt to double- or triple-book your calendar for panel slots or parties in case a room fills up or if a line is too long. Always leave yourself some extra options. Don't bring: Inflexibility. Once you have a set plan, be prepared to abandon whole chunks of it. You'll meet new people, perhaps find old friends, hear about a great party that's happening or discover that the panel you were dying to attend has been canceled or has reached capacity. Be flexible, go with the flow and have no regrets about missing something; there's plenty to see and do. You'll wear yourself out and miss potentially serendipitous moments if you hold too firmly to your schedule. Bring: Extra battery packs and your own Internet. A good day at SXSW Interactive is at least 12 hours long, and you might be using your smartphone, tablet or laptop a lot to look up information or try new apps. Your batteries will get depleted, and it's not always easy to find a free power outlet in packed panel rooms. Bring charging cables and power supplies for your gear. You can also find cheap, portable backup battery chargers for most smartphones on Amazon for as little as $6 to $10. Buy at least one, maybe two. A portable power strip wouldn't hurt either if you want to share power outlets with your fellow attendees. Some years, wireless phone networks haven't held up under the strain of all the tech-centric attendees. Outside the Convention Center in the downtown wilds, there aren't as many free Wi-Fi locations as you'd hope. If what you're doing at the fest requires a constant Internet connection, consider bringing your own Wi-Fi hotspot device. Don't bring: Expensive tech gear or cameras that haven't been backed up. Every year, I hear about someone who had a laptop stolen or lost a camera containing a memory card full of precious photos that were never transferred to a computer. Keep your stuff safe and don't bring anything irreplaceable. Bring: A giant smile. Texans are very friendly. We want nothing more than for you to go home after your trip and rave about how delicious our barbecue tastes and how we're all as soulful and attractive as the characters on ""Friday Night Lights."" But it only works if you're humble and attitude-free. Which brings us to ... Don't bring: Attitude. In recent years, the influx of social media gurus and marketing mavens has changed the vibe at some parts of SXSW Interactive from a spring break for nerds to a focus group for startups aimed at Twitterholics. Leave behind the smarmy business networking and condescending attitude toward those who aren't online rock stars. Don't be That Guy (or Gal). Bring: Comfy shoes, light clothes and an umbrella. March and October are our best weather months in Austin, but it can turn on a dime. Dress lightly, but bring a jacket for the colder evenings and have an umbrella handy in case a thunderstorm rolls through. And wear comfortable, broken-in shoes -- you'll be on your feet a lot. Don't bring: Ostentatious cowboy boots and a 10-gallon hat you only wear when you're visiting Texas. We Texans see right through that crap.","SXSW veteran Omar Gallaga offers his advice for how to best appreciate the festival .

"(CNN) -- A homeless man who attended the MTV Video Music Awards with Miley Cyrus has turned himself in to police, authorities said. Jesse Helt, 22, took center stage at Sunday's VMA broadcast when he accepted the video of the year award on behalf of the pop star. He used the spotlight to talk about issues affecting homeless youth. ""I am accepting this award on behalf of the 1.6 million runaways and homeless youth in the United States who are starving, lost and scared for their lives right now,"" Helt said. ""I know this because I am one of these people."" Shortly after his appearance, Oregon authorities said he had an arrest warrant that was issued in November 2011 after he allegedly violated his parole following a criminal trespass conviction. Helt grew up in northwest Oregon, where his mother still lives. He turned himself in Thursday night, posted $2,500 in bail and left, according to Martin Silbernagel, the community corrections director for Polk County, Oregon. Helt was initially arrested in October 2010 on burglary, criminal mischief and criminal trespass charges. The burglary count was dismissed, but he was convicted of the mischief and trespass counts, authorities said.","Jesse Helt took center stage at Sunday's VMA broadcast .

"(CNN) -- There are two good reasons to own a giant trampoline. The first is for bouncing super-duper high to spy on your weirdo neighbors, what with the constant sound of all that slapping leather. And the second reason is because you're fearlessly young and enjoy the occasional compound fracture. You know how kids are. ""I'll show you my tibia if you show me yours."" But the pleasures that come from owning your own spring-loaded backyard injury machine only last a short time. Roughly about an hour. Maybe longer if you use it without pants. But then it just becomes this thing that sits in the sun and collects leaves. Which is exactly what happened for Scott Maney of Wellesley, Massachusetts. So Maney finally decided to sell his trampoline on Craigslist, and in the process, used it as a beautiful opportunity to crap all over his wonderful kids. Naturally, the Internet loved it. His June 8 Craigslist headline reads ""My Kids Suck"" and the ad begins like this: . ""They begged. They pleaded. They told me how they'd use it EVERY day. How our house would become THE place to hang out. We had a hot tub. And a basketball court. And a fire pit. And a hammock. But if we had THIS, well, we'd be rock stars."" Here, Maney refers to his three aforementioned wonderful kids -- his self-proclaimed ""Irish triplets"" -- who are now 18, 16, and 14. He bought the trampoline two years ago for them, sort of as an apology after his family relocated to Wellesley from Chicago. The kids weren't happy, and he tried to make it up to them. Maney explains this in the ad: . ""Plus since I ""messed up their lives"" by moving them here in middle school, I owed them at least this much. God, dad."" So, it seemed like a good idea. Besides, in the outdoor space which would eventually become the trampoline's quiet home of sadness and neglect, the previous homeowners had left behind a play set. ""The kids were too old for that already, and the dog kept pooping in the sand box,"" Maney told me. ""I knew it had to go."" The ad continues: . ""So I caved. And I bought it. And I built it. And that first night they jumped."" THEY jumped. Maney, in fact, did not. ""Are you nuts? You know how dangerous those things are? That's got torn ACL written all over it."" Next, the ad gets rather sad and sentimental. He wrote: . ""Then I watched from my window as the summer turned to fall and the fall turned to winter and the flurries came down and the snowmen went up and the rain came down and the flowers came up and spring turned to summer and I watched even still from the window, waiting, just waiting, for someone, anyone, to use that damn trampoline even once more. Oh, please, please, just once."" At which point Maney's brief poetic aside comes to an abrupt stop: . ""My kids suck."" Maney drove this point home, telling me that he wasn't even sure if any of his kids had been on the trampoline in over a year. Maybe just him when he swept off the leaves to take pictures for the ad. Which concludes: . ""So after two years of sitting in my window staring out like a creepy old neighbor, I am selling it to make room for gardenias or tomato plants or a stockade jail to house three grumpy teenagers. Haven't decided yet."" The trampoline sold in less than 24 hours. Which, of course, was great. But the reactions he got online were ever better. Maney says he received about 100 e-mails from people who enjoyed his trampoline ad, and about 20 more from people who actually wanted to buy it. His ad was on online hit. ""I've worked in the advertising business for 20-plus years and never had a piece of content go truly viral,"" he said. ""I write one Craigslist ad..."" Now he's had a taste. And it feels good. In fact, Maney's thinking of seeing if lightning can strike twice. ""I'm scouring the house looking for that French horn. My Kids Suck, Part 2."" Follow @JarrettBellini on Twitter.

"(CNN) -- As a third-grader in Winsted, Connecticut, last year, Matthew Asselin was sick -- a lot. He was lethargic and plagued with a persistent wet cough, respiratory infections and painful headaches. As the school year wound down, Matthew's health worsened. He was out for two weeks in the spring with pneumonia and then developed a sinus infection so severe he needed to spend the night at the hospital, where he received intravenous antibiotics and breathing treatments. In all, Matthew missed 53 days of school. But over the summer, a strange thing happened. Matthew was healthy. He was energetic. He could ride his bike for hours at a time. ""When we put him back in school this year, within three weeks, he missed 10 days with a respiratory infection,"" Melissa Asselin said. That's when Matthew's mother had an a-ha moment. ""When he was out of school, he was well. When he was in school, he became ill,"" Asselin said. Matthew's parents concluded that the 9-year-old's school, Hinsdale Elementary, was making their son sick. Indoor air problems . Figures are hard to come by, but studies have estimated that a third or more of U.S. schools have mold, dust and other indoor air problems serious enough to provoke respiratory issues like asthma in students and teachers. A national survey of school nurses found that 40% knew children and staff adversely affected by indoor pollutants. Indoor air affects more than health. A growing body of research suggests students also perform better in schools with healthier air. ""If you get an unhealthy building, you're not going to have a successful school,"" said Lily Eskelsen, vice president of the National Education Association, the largest teachers' union in the United States. ""Asthma is the number one chronic illness that keeps kids out of school, and it's growing,"" Eskelsen added. About one in 10 children in the United States now has asthma, which causes them to miss an average of four days of school a year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Dr. John Santilli, a Connecticut allergist, says he has treated dozens of students sickened by school air. Even when children don't miss school, he said, the medications they take for asthma and conditions like rhinitis, an allergic reaction to mold or dust, can make it harder for them to do their best work. ""They're on antihistamines, they're on nasal sprays, they're on asthma medications, and this limits their ability to perform,"" Santilli said. ""These kids can't concentrate. They can't focus on what's going on."" Dr. Santilli says about 20% to 30% of people are susceptible to mold or dust, which triggers an allergic reaction. The resulting symptoms can include itchy eyes, runny nose, coughing, headaches, fatigue, even memory problems and slowed thinking. ""It takes a lot to make you sick, but it takes very little exposure once you're sensitized to provoke symptoms,"" Santilli said. ""As time goes on, it takes more and more out of you, and you get sicker and sicker."" A growing problem . Researchers and others who follow the issue say school air problems have probably been exacerbated in recent years by funding cutbacks that have resulted in less money for building upkeep and maintenance. In Reading, Pennsylvania, the school board cut $18 million from the 2011-12 budget -- more than $1,000 per student -- which left acting Superintendent Drue Miles with little money to fix problems among aging buildings. At Reading's Southern Middle School, for example, water pours into an upstairs classroom through holes in the roof when it rains. There's no money to replace the roof, only patch it, Miles said. ""The buildings continue to deteriorate, and we only have a small amount of dollars to spread to do just some minimal things,"" Miles said. Researchers at the New York state Health Department found a correlation between building maintenance at the public schools and hospitalizations for asthma. The condition of roofs, windows, walls and boilers were all related to the health of children at the school, researchers found. A similar study in Boston schools found a link between asthma rates and leaks, mold, lack of repairs and visible signs of insects or rodents. Children are particularly at risk because their bodies are still developing and they breathe in more air, pound for pound, than adults. ""Schools are more densely occupied than office buildings, and children aren't little adults. They're uniquely vulnerable,"" said Claire Barnett, founder and executive director of the Healthy Schools Network, a nonprofit group focused on environmental health in schools. Teachers at risk . Kids aren't the only ones affected by school air. Joellen Lawson was a special education teacher at a Fairfield, Connecticut, elementary school so plagued with mold that it robbed Lawson of her health. Officials finally decided to tear it down and start from scratch, costing the district more than $20 million. ""I've never recovered fully, and I've also never had a pain-free day,"" said Lawson, who is on permanent disability with a host of ailments including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a condition that has left her with 50% of her lung capacity. According to a survey of teachers in the nation's capital, two-thirds reported air quality at their schools of either fair or poor. More than half of Chicago teachers responding to the same survey also reported fair or poor school air quality. More than a quarter of Chicago teachers surveyed said they had suffered adverse health effects because of the school environment; a third of the Washington teachers also reported these adverse health effects. One family's solution . Tests this fall at Matthew Asselin's school, Hinsdale Elementary, showed elevated levels of mold in the gymnasium/cafeteria and two other areas, and the school district spent $16,000 for a thorough cleaning. The school board is also considering whether to close the school temporarily to replace a leaky roof and make other repairs. Matthew's parents aren't taking any chances with their son's health. They pulled him from Hinsdale. His mother, Melissa, who received her degree in elementary education last year, is now home-schooling the 9-year-old. The change has been a financial burden on the family, but Asselin says she wouldn't have it any other way. ""He's a different child,"" she said. ""Now he's so healthy and happy. I can't put a price on that.""","Woman says school air sickened her son for 53 days last school year .

"(CNN) -- A Texas actress in a troubled marriage was arrested and charged Friday in connection with ricin-tainted letters that were mailed last month to President Barack Obama and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, authorities said. Shannon Richardson, 35, also known as Shannon Rogers and Shannon Guess, initially told the FBI that her husband, Nathaniel, sent the ricin-laced letters, but a polygraph exam found her to be ""deceptive"" on the matter, court papers said. Investigators found that her computer storage devices contained the text of threatening letters sent to the president, but the couple's computer records show her husband couldn't have printed them out because he was at work at the time, an FBI arrest affidavit said. On Thursday, Shannon Richardson told investigators she mailed the ricin-tainted letters, but she claimed that her husband typed the letters and forced her to print and mail them, the affidavit said. New poison letters put ricin under microscope . Her husband denied involvement and claimed his wife wanted to end their marriage and leave him, the affidavit said. He told investigators that his wife was ""intentionally misleading"" them, the court papers said. Shannon Richardson is accused of mailing a threatening communication to the president and faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted, according to a statement from U.S. Attorney John M. Bales' office in Texas. Also on Thursday, Nathaniel Richardson filed for divorce. His wife is pregnant, and the anticipated birth date and sex of the fetus is not known, the divorce lawsuit said. The couple married on October 8, 2011, the suit said. Shannon Richardson allegedly also mailed a third letter with the toxin ricin to Mark Glaze, director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, which was founded and co-chaired by Bloomberg, the FBI arrest affidavit said. The group's office is in Washington. She made an initial appearance Friday afternoon before U.S. Magistrate Judge Caroline Craven in Texarkana, Texas, the prosecutor said. She was arrested in Mount Pleasant, Texas, authorities said. The three letters were mailed from Shreveport, Louisiana, last month, federal authorities say. The FBI found ""very low concentrations"" of ricin on the letters, a spokesman said last month. Richardson has had minor roles in TV series, including ""The Walking Dead"" and ""The Vampire Diaries."" A law enforcement official told CNN that investigators believe Richardson sent the letters herself. She was angry at her husband, the official said. CNN reported early in the investigation that the FBI considered Richardson to have serious credibility issues when they began interviewing her. What is ricin?

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Oscar-winning actor Javier Bardem calls Israel's treatment of Palestinians ""genocide,"" while ""Wonder Woman"" actress Gal Gadot sends her ""love and prayers"" to Israeli soldiers in Gaza. One Direction singer Zayn Malik, a Muslim born in England, received online death threats for tweeting #FreePalestine, a hashtag that Barbados-born singer Rihanna also tweeted but quickly deleted. Celebs are using social media accounts, which are essential for building their show business brands, as political platforms that can cause a negative buzz. Veteran Hollywood publicist Michael Levine cautions clients to be careful about stepping into the public relations controversies that surround any comment on the Israel-Gaza crisis. ""Twitter has proven to be a minefield for celebrities,"" Levine said Tuesday. ""It provides celebrities with an opportunity to make any number of careless mistakes that can come back to haunt them. But in a war environment, where emotions are so high and people are seeing pictures on CNN of babies dying and crying, it's particularly incendiary."" The 140 characters in a Twitter posting are ""like you're burping out thoughts,"" Levine said. For Malik, it was a hashtag -- #FreePalestine -- the caused an uproar on Sunday. Only 14 characters, it delivered a message of sympathy for residents of Gaza to his 13 million followers that was retweeted more than 200,000 times over the next 24 hours. The responses ranged from followers saying they were ""proud of Zayn"" to tweets calling on the singer to ""kill himself."" Some Israeli fans declared disappointment in the music idol. Malik hasn't tweeted since, and his publicist declined to comment. The Twitterverse controversy Rihanna stirred up this summer with messages of support for opponents of the U.S. World Cup team is nothing compared with the reaction to her #FreePalestine tweet on July 15. She deleted it just eight minutes later, but some of her 36 million followers grabbed it first. A source close to the singer explained that it was not an intentional tweet. It was soon replaced by this less divisive message: ""Let's pray for peace and a swift end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict! Is there any hope?...."" The fast deletion was followed by controversy and debate. One fan tweeted, ""What's the point in being rich & famous if you can't publicly stand up for what's right?"" Bardem's condemnation of Israel was not a spontaneous or accidental message. The actor sent a 400-word letter to Spanish newspapers last week entitled ""Genocide."" ""In the horror that is happening in Gaza, there is no room for distance or neutrality,"" Bardem wrote. ""It is an occupational war and an extermination one against a town with no means, confined to minimum territory, without water and where hospitals, ambulances and children are targets and alleged terrorists. It is difficult to understand and impossible to justify. And it is embarrassing that the position of the Western international community is allowing such genocide."" Bardem followed it with a similar ""open letter"" also signed by others, including his wife, Oscar-winning actress Penelope Cruz, and Oscar-winning director Pedro Almodovar. Cruz sent a statement to CNN on Wednesday defending her participation in the letter: . ""I don't want to be misunderstood on this important subject.Â Â I'm not an expert on the situation and I'm aware of the complexity of it . My only wish and intention in signing that group letter is the hope that there will be peace in both Israel and Gaza. I am hopeful all parties can agree to a cease fire and there are no more innocent victims on either side of the border. I wish for unity, and peace... I believe in a civilization that can be capable of bringing the courage to have a world where humans can live side by side.""Â . Gal Gadot, the actress cast as the new incarnation of Wonder Woman, used her Facebook page to show support for Israel. Her posting is not a surprise, considering she served in the Israeli army and represented her country as Miss Israel. ""I am sending my love and prayers to my fellow Israeli citizens,"" Gadot wrote. ""Especially to all the boys and girls who are risking their lives protecting my country against the horrific acts conducted by Hamas, who are hiding like cowards behind women and children...We shall overcome!!! Shabbat Shalom! #weareright #freegazafromhamas #stopterror #coexistance #loveidf"" Israeli model Bar Refaeli quoted Abraham Lincoln in an Instagram post with the hashtag #stopterror: ""There is no honorable way to kill, no gentle way to destroy. there is nothing good in war, except its ending"" Comedian Bill Maher, whose career is built on controversial commentary, used humor to defend Israel in a tweet: ""Dealing w/ Hamas is like dealing w/ a crazy woman who's trying to kill u - u can only hold her wrists so long before you have to slap her"" Sometimes it is silence that speaks.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama is vowing to act on his own due to House inaction on immigration reform that proponents say could help address a wave of undocumented kids crossing the border from Mexico. But there are limits to the power of his pen. Yes, the President can send National Guard troops to the border as some House Republicans insisted at recent congressional hearing on immigration. No, the administration can't put immigrant kids ""on a bus like we normally do and send them back down to Guatemala,"" as Alabama Republican Rep. Mike Rogers suggested. The children have arrived in droves after fleeing violence and poverty in Central America and are seeking ""permisos"" or a pass to stay in America. Thousands are being held in detention facilities as the Obama administration tries to figure out what to do. And while Obama promises ""a new effort to fix as much of our immigration system as I can on my own, without Congress,"" Speaker John Boehner and other House Republicans criticize him for being ""intent on going it alone with executive orders that can't and won't fix these problems."" Boehner has said he intends to sue Obama over how he's used his executive authority to bypass Congress. Beyond the political back-and-forth, there are some things Obama can and cannot do by way of executive action on immigration. What he can do . 1. He can tweak and fine tune existing guidelines on who to prioritize and prosecute in deportation hearings. 2. Obama can dispatch more border patrol agents as well as members of the National Guard. 3. And Obama could opt to continue a program for some who were brought to the United States as kids. It is important to note that this program allows them to temporarily stay in the country and work or attend school. It is not a path to legalization. 4. The President could also continue a practice in some states of using ankle bracelets or weekly mandatory check-ins with immigration officials as an alternative to detention. 5. And he could move to increase the amount of free legal assistance to immigrants in deportation hearings. ""If the transfer of resources involves moving judges down to that area so they can process the caseload and more asylum officers to conduct interviews with these children then we're in a zero-sum game,"" said Kamal Essaheb, a policy attorney National Immigration Law Center. ""Those resources are being taken away from other areas. We would welcome Congress appropriating more money so everyone can get their day in court and a quick day in court."" What he can't do . 1. The president can't bar people from applying for political asylum. Those guidelines are set by the United Nations Refugee Convention, which the United States has signed, said Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration attorney and professor at Cornell University Law School. 2. And no, the President can't increase the number eligible for green cards because their spouses or parents are U.S. citizens. Such matters are set by law. Though some immigration advocates have argued spouses and children shouldn't count toward 140,000 limit on employment-based green cards, whether the President can make that kind of change unilaterally is murky territory. 3. Obama also can't just eliminate judicial review for people ordered deported â€” such a move would violate the Constitution. 4. Nor can he just load up all undocumented immigrants on a bus and deport them without some sort of legal hearing. That type of action also would violate the law. ""The Constitution says that all persons have due process rights in the U.S. whether they are from another country or the U.S.,"" Yale-Loehr said. 5. And, for those hoping for (or fearing) a blanket executive action legalizing all undocumented immigrants, no the President can't do that either. There's a law for that. ""There are constitutional limits on what the president can do. We have a tripartite government system. The Congress enacts the laws; the President implements the laws,"" Yale-Loehr said. ""The President cannot create an immigration policy willy-nilly, whole cloth. He cannot create an immigration law. He has to get Congress' approval to change an immigration law. "" Navarette: The right fate for immigrant kids . Crossroads of hope and fear: Stories from a desert bus station .","Beyond political rhetoric, there are limits on Obama's powers on immigration .
The President can prioritize who gets deported, putting violent criminals at the top of the list .
He cannot, as some in the GOP want, put immigrant kids on buses bound for Central America .
In many cases, the President does have to work with Congress in crafting immigration reforms ."
"(CNN) -- Two Connecticut police officers were found guilty Monday of violating the civil rights of Latinos after a federal investigation uncovered a culture of bias within the East Haven Police Department, according to prosecutors. Officer Dennis Spaulding and former officer David Cari were convicted of conspiring to violate and violating the civil rights of Latinos in the East Haven community, according to a press release from the U.S. Attorney of the District of Connecticut. Spaulding and Cari worked together to ""injure, threaten and intimidate"" Latinos in the Connecticut community, according to prosecutors. Evidence presented during the month-long trial showed that the men made unlawful arrests, including the arrest of a Catholic priest, at times using excessive force. The men later conspired to cover up evidence of their conduct by falsifying reports and blocking an investigation, prosecutors said. ""No one is above the law, and no one is beneath the law's protection,"" acting U.S. Attorney Deirdre M. Daly said Monday. ""The illegal behavior detailed during the course of this trial chips away at the public's trust in all members of law enforcement, the vast majority of whom serve honorably and bravely each and every day."" Cari and Spaulding, along with two other East Haven police officers -- John Miller and Jason Zullo -- were arrested in January 2012 following a federal investigation into racial profiling in the city. ""They behaved like bullies with badges,"" Janice Fedarcyk, assistant FBI director in New York, said in 2012. ""For some in our community, today's verdict provides a sense of vindication and closure. For others, especially our Police family, it is a difficult and sad occasion,"" East Haven Mayor Joseph Maturo said in a statement Monday. ""What is clear is that for all of our residents, it is an opportunity to close a difficult chapter in our Town's past and move forward as one, unified community."" Maturo said the city has made several changes since the arrests, such as opening up the police department, holding community meetings, offering cultural sensitivity training to town employees and providing resourced for residents with limited English proficiency. The indictment that led to the trial cited instances including an occasion on January 21, 2009, when Spaulding and Zullo assaulted two individuals they had arrested under false pretenses, slamming their heads against the station's cell block walls. The indictment cited a similar incident in which Miller struck a detainee who was handcuffed after the detainee was propped up by two other patrol officers. The 2012 arrests came just weeks after a scathing Department of Justice report, derived from an investigation that began in September 2009, accusing the town's police of engaging in ""discriminatory policing against Latinos."" In a letter to Mayor Maturo, Assistant U.S. Attorney General Thomas J. Perez said the practice was ""deeply rooted in the department's culture,"" citing statistical analysis that showed Latinos had been ""intentionally targeted"" for traffic stops. The letter provided an example of a particular officer's stops, 40.5% of which were of Latino drivers. Overall, the investigation found that 19.9% of traffic stops made by East Haven police were against Latino drivers, concluding it ""shows pervasive discrimination against Latinos on every level of EHPD traffic enforcement activity."" The report also accused some officers of conducting unauthorized immigration investigations. It mentioned ""numerous incident reports"" in which officers contacted Immigration and Customs Enforcement to check on the status or seek an immigration detention of a Latino. Investigators said the tactic was ""used to harass and intimidate Latinos rather than pursue legitimate law enforcement objectives."" Police Chief Leonard Gallo retired in February 2012 amid controversy after the arrests were made. The controversy spread beyond the police department to the mayor's office. After being asked by a reporter in 2012 what he'd do for the Latino community in light of the officers' arrest, Maturo said that ""I might have tacos when I get home, I'm not quite sure yet."" Cari and Spaulding are set to be sentenced on January 21, 2014. Miller pleaded guilty to a civil rights violation by use of unreasonable force during the course of an arrest in September 2012. Zullo pleaded guilty to one count of obstruction in October 2012, according to the U.S. attorney's office. Both Miller and Zullo are awaiting sentencing.

"Monrovia, Liberia (CNN) -- It's not often that you see the words Liberia and holidays in the same sentence, but with 10 years of peace behind it, the West African country is now hoping to attract investment to create a booming hospitality industry. Like many of his countrymen, Amin Modad left Liberia in the late 1990s to seek refuge in the United States during the country's ruinous civil war. The conflict ended in 2003 and when Modad returned home two years later, he quickly recognized an opportunity where he could use the business skills he'd gained abroad. ""It was evident there was a need to develop the hospitality sector,"" says Modad, chief executive of the Bella Casa hotel and restaurant. Read this: Liberia's guns become weapons of mass creation . With just a few full-service hotels operating in the country, Modad decided to convert his parents' small house in the capital of Monrovia into a boutique hotel. ""At that time ... we saw an influx of investors, an influx of NGOs, but yet still Liberia did not have the capacity to cater to them,"" he says. ""I think at one point in time (2005, 2006) it was stated that Liberia had not even close to 200 good decent rooms."" Standing skeletons . The civil war left an estimated 250,000 people dead and many more displaced. It also destroyed much of Liberia's economy and infrastructure. The country's hotels were also victims; to this day, the skeletons of two of Liberia's biggest hotels -- Ducor Intercontinental and Hotel Africa -- still stand, serving as a grim reminder of the impact the war had on the country. ""Before the war, Liberia had a couple of very good hotels,"" says Modad. ""In fact, the Ducor Intercontinental, from what we know, was one of the first five-star hotels in Africa."" High costs . Political stability over the past decade, coupled with growing government revenues thanks to the mining sector, has allowed for the building of some essential infrastructure. Yet the re-development is far from complete -- Liberia's main source of power, its hydroelectric dam, was also shattered during the war, leaving the power situation in the country very unreliable to this day. As a result, any business that depends on constant electricity must rely on costly generators. ""We do not have adequate electricity -- public electricity -- or water supply,"" says Modad, sitting inside his hotel. ""It costs me close to $10,000 to $11,000 a month just to provide electricity for such a small establishment,"" he adds. Read this: Holidays in Somalia, anyone? With rainforest, sandy beaches and an emerging surf scene, Liberia has its attractions. But it takes more than attractions to create a vibrant tourist destination. Axel M. Addy, the Liberian minister of commerce and industry, admits that entrepreneurs betting on an upward trend in the hospitality industry face many challenges. He says that high energy costs and skills shortage make hotels a difficult enterprise to venture into. ""Right now, if an investor wants to build a resort here, they have to build the entire infrastructure,"" says Addy. Potential for growth . This need for self-sustainability is something that J.J. Vodak, general manager of the RLJ Kendeja Resort & Villas, Liberia's largest resort just outside Monrovia, knows too well. ""We have our own water plant, our own sewage plant, our own generators and so on,"" says Vodak. ""So basically we're fully independent in anything that we are doing."" Yet Vodak is optimistic about the progress he sees in Liberia's development, encouraged by the country's stable political environment. ""The potential for growing is there,"" he says. ""The stability of the political situation plays an enormous role because that allows for people to come here and feel comfortable that 'OK, we're going to spend x amount of millions of dollars in this country but it's not going to go down south, it will continue to stabilize.' There is a potential return investment."" Read this: The woman fixing Liberia's water crisis . Addy agrees that, despite the challenges, there is a reason to be optimistic. ""This country is a gift, it's a tourist attraction waiting to happen,"" he says. ""If the energy situation comes under control -- and we're making investments in energy right now and we're talking to our partners to see how we can fast track that process -- would then make us more competitive and more attractive for some of these opportunities."" Back at Bella Casa, Modad says that he plans to continue expanding his hotel, as well as build another one in the city of Buchanan. He foresees that the investments he's making now will pay off down the road, but urges the government to provide support to those entrepreneurs interested in investing in the country. ""I would like to encourage Liberian investment into the sector,"" he says. ""But to have that the government needs to provide the incentive to Liberian enterprises, Liberian entrepreneurs, who are willing to take such risks.""","The West African nation of Liberia is celebrating 10 years of peace .
The country's hospitality entrepreneurs are trying to foster the sector's growth .
Insiders say the industry has potential for growth but still faces many obstacles .

"(CNN) -- Hong Kong and Singapore attract the most international travelers, according to the latest Euromonitor Top 100 City Destinations Ranking.

Asia Pacific cities dominate the list with six of the top 10 and 32 of the top 100 spots. Twenty cities are from Western Europe. Hong Kong's popularity comes largely thanks to its northern neighbors. Chinese visitors make up 63.5% of the city's inbound visitors, up 11.1% in 2012 compared with 2011. According to Euromonitor, international arrivals to Hong Kong would be static without this group.

Currently, Germany, the United States, UK, China and Russia are the top five countries for international departures, according to Euromonitor. Meanwhile, Chinese cities are struggling to attract visitors. Shanghai, Beijing and Zhuhai ranked low in 2012 because of a slowing economy, strong yuan and pollution, said Euromonitor's report.

"(CNN) -- Years of aiming missiles at people on the other side of the world left Brandon Bryant a broken man. In an interview with the magazine GQ, Bryant recounts some of the grisly scenes he watched unfold on his monitor as an Air Force drone operator. In grimly vivid detail, he talks about the first time he killed somebody, in early 2007. He was sitting in a control station on an Air Force base in Nevada. His three victims were walking on a dirt road in Afghanistan. After the Hellfire missile fired from the drone struck the three men, Bryant watched the aftermath on his infrared display. ""The smoke clears, and there's pieces of the two guys around the crater. And there's this guy over here, and he's missing his right leg above his knee,"" he says in the article in the November issue of GQ. ""He's holding it, and he's rolling around, and the blood is squirting out of his leg, and it's hitting the ground, and it's hot. His blood is hot,"" Bryant says. ""But when it hits the ground, it starts to cool off; the pool cools fast. It took him a long time to die. I just watched him. I watched him become the same color as the ground he was lying on."" Drone program in spotlight . Bryant, 27, has talked about his experiences before -- to the German magazine Der Spiegel and to the U.S. broadcaster NBC. But the publication of his interview with GQ comes amid renewed questions about the human cost and the legality of the U.S. drone program. U.S. officials say the program is a vital tool in the fight against militant groups such as al Qaeda. But two international human rights groups raised serious concerns Tuesday about the consequences of drone strikes in Pakistan and Yemen, suggesting some attacks in recent years might amount to war crimes. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch released reports giving detailed accounts of a number of attacks they say the United States carried out in each of the two countries, resulting in the deaths of scores of civilians. The reports drew from extensive field research -- including interviews with witnesses and relatives of victims -- and called for a series of measures to bring the program in line with international law. Leaders to meet . The White House on Tuesday disputed the reports' assertions that drone strikes had broken the law. But the situation was made all the more awkward by the presence in Washington of Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who held talks with U.S. President Barack Obama on Wednesday. After the meeting, Sharif said he had raised the issue of drones with Obama, ""emphasizing the need for an end to such strikes."" In remarks a day earlier at the U.S. Institute of Peace in Washington, Sharif outlined some of the Pakistani government's objections to the drone program. ""Recently our political parties in a national conference declared the use of drones is not only a continued violation of our territorial integrity but also detrimental to our resolve at efforts in eliminating terrorism from our country,"" he said. 'Zombie mode' Bryant's interview gives a different perspective on the drone program. The GQ article provides a detailed study of his time as a drone operative, his decision in 2011 to quit and the post-traumatic stress disorder that followed. Bryant says that during his time monitoring drones' cameras and aiming its laser targeting system, he became numb and carried out the job in ""zombie mode."" When he left the Air Force in the spring of 2011 -- after nearly six years -- he says he turned down a $109,000 bonus to continue operating the drones. He was given a document totaling the number of people killed in missions in which he'd participated in some form during close to 6,000 hours of flight time. The overall number of 1,626, he says, ""made me sick to my stomach."" A 'critical' role . Looking back, he tells GQ, he would feel ""horrible"" living under a sky in which drones hover, watching and sometimes killing. But he says that when he started the job, he believed that the remotely piloted aircraft could help save lives. The U.S. Defense Department has repeatedly argued that they prevent the deaths of American soldiers and protect the nation from terrorism. Bryant talks of efforts by drone crews to help U.S. troops avoid harm and of atrocities he saw committed by militants. He says he watched on his screen as an insurgent commander pulled two girls out of the trunk of his vehicle in a crowded marketplace in Iraq.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Four men accused by prosecutors of being ""eager to bring death to Jews"" were ordered held without bail Thursday, accused of trying to bomb two New York synagogues and planning to fire surface-to-air missiles at U.S. military planes. Three of the suspects are taken away by authorities after the arrests were made. The plot ended with federal agents and New York police using an 18-wheel truck to block the vehicle containing the suspects after they planted what they believed were explosive devices in cars near the synagogues Wednesday night, said New York City Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly. The devices were duds. All four suspects are accused of plotting to detonate explosives near two synagogues in the Riverdale section of the Bronx and seeking to fire missiles at planes at an Air National Guard base. Kelly described the plot as homegrown, with no known links to any foreign or domestic groups. The plot was uncovered in a yearlong investigation involving an FBI informant, authorities said. At a court hearing Thursday, three of the suspects -- James Cromitie, David Williams and Onta Williams -- shook their heads as prosecutors appealed to U.S. Magistrate Lisa Smith to order them held without bail. Prosecutor Eric Snyder described the suspects as violent men ""eager to bring death to Jews.""  Watch police commissioner give details on suspects » . Smith ordered the three to remain in custody without bail until their next court appearance on June 5. Smith also approved a request by Cromitie, accused of being the ringleader, for medical care for cuts he said he received from flying glass during the arrest. After the hearing, Cromitie's lawyer, Vincent Briccetti, declined to comment on the case. At a later hearing, the fourth suspect, Laguerre Payen, also was remanded without bail. Payen received medical treatment for injuries he suffered during the arrest and had a bandage over one eye at his hearing. Payen's lawyer said her client had a history of mental instability, but Snyder, the prosecutor, said videotapes of the suspects showed Payen to be a coherent and willing participant. Payen told the judge he has prescriptions for the drugs Celexa and Seroquel. Celexa is used to treat depression and Seroquel is used to treat conditions including bipolar disorder. Cromitie, David Williams and Onta Williams are U.S. citizens, while Payen is a Haitian, according to the New York governor's office. Police said three of the suspects have prior criminal records and all were believed to consider themselves Muslim. Mayor Michael Bloomberg praised the work of his city's police department and federal authorities in uncovering the alleged plot. ""The good news here is that the New York Police Department and FBI did exactly what they're trained to do and prevented what could have been a terrible event,"" Bloomberg said. ""We have to constantly be vigilant."" At the targeted sites on Thursday, worshippers said they were relieved that the plot was halted, but they didn't intend to change their daily routines. ""Unfortunately, this is the world we live in,"" said Nurit Bacharach of the Gan Miriam Early Childhood Center at the Hebrew Institute in Riverdale. ""We just have to forge ahead and keep a positive mind and live life and just be cautious and aware."" According to New York and federal authorities, an FBI informant met with Cromitie in June 2008 in Newburgh, New York. During that meeting Cromitie said his parents lived in Afghanistan, he was angry about the U.S. war there, and he had an interest in ""doing something to America.""  Watch suspects' possible motivation » . The four suspects began meeting and plotting to bomb the synagogues with the informant at a home equipped with concealed video and audio equipment, authorities said. The suspects also conducted surveillance, including photographs, of an Air National Guard base where they wanted to blow up planes, authorities said. The informant provided the men with a surface-to-air guided missile and C-4 plastic explosives, none of which could actually be used. ""No one was at risk,"" said Kelly, the police commissioner, describing the explosive devices as duds created to dupe the suspects. Kelly said that after the suspects planted the 37-pound devices in two cars, a waiting contingent of officers pulled an 18-wheeler across the road to block the suspects' vehicle and then smashed their windows to apprehend them without a struggle. The charges against the men include conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction in the United States and conspiracy to acquire and use anti-aircraft missiles. The charges carry a maximum sentence of life in prison.","NEW: All four suspects ordered held without bail .

"(CNN) -- Here's a factoid many people know but few seem to understand: Alaska has the highest ratio of men to women in the United States. Several of you tweeted and e-mailed me that data point after I published a series of stories on the fact that Alaska also has the highest rate of reported rape in the country. Maybe the superlatives are related? you wondered. Here's a quick sample of comments I got on Twitter: . • ""I lived in Anchorage. It was about 10 men to one woman per capita in the 80s, a lot of bars, partying. Last frontier mentality."" • ""Highest male to female ratio, too. Very masculine culture. Needs to change male behavior there."" • ""This is because there are about 12 men to every woman. Odds are good but the goods are odd! I lived there, I know!"" It's true there are more men in Alaska than women, but the situation isn't nearly as extreme in reality as it is in the popular imagination. There are 107 men in Alaska for every 100 women, according to 2013 estimates from the Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development (Excel). That's an estimated 380,741 males and 355,658 females. The difference: 25,083. An imbalance, sure. But does it explain the high rape rate? No way, said Andre Rosay, director of the University of Alaska Anchorage Justice Center. I invited Rosay to a live online chat with readers about this question and others. ""The Alaska rates of violence against women are much higher than they are elsewhere,"" he wrote. ""The difference in the men to women ratio isn't big enough to account for the astoundingly high rates of violence that we see here in Alaska."" There remain some areas of the state, such as the Aleutian Islands, where only a third of the population is female, according to a 2012 research brief to the Alaska State Legislature (PDF). But the statewide ratio is shrinking toward insignificance. ""While the ratio of men to women in Alaska is still higher than any other state in the country, it is much smaller than a hundred years ago, when men outnumbered women nearly 2½ to one,"" the brief says. ""The percentage of women in the population has grown over the past century, currently making up about 48% of the state's population. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, women comprise 50.8% of the national population."" As I detailed in my series for the Change the List project (more at CNN.com/Change), there are a number of complicated reasons Alaska is dangerous for women, from its long, dark winters to high rates of alcohol abuse and, perhaps more important than either, an awful history of cultural trauma and colonial violence. The ratio alone can't explain it. And it's not the statistic we should be focusing on. Alaska's reported rape rate is three times the national average. State surveys show that an estimated 37% of women in Alaska suffer from sexual violence -- and nearly six in 10 suffer from sexual and/or intimate partner violence, which includes threats of violence. The governor told me the situation is an ""epidemic."" I'm open to the possibility that the men-to-women ratio may affect the odds that men in Alaska will be able to find lasting relationships. This has long been a favorite topic for newspaper reporters, who write about the ratio with a sort of faux-fascination. ""There they were,"" a New York Times reporter wrote of women in a Nome, Alaska, bar in 2004, ""an oasis in the Arctic, shooting pool, giving out phone numbers, dashing off to the restroom to apply lipstick, coquettishly sipping drinks bought by their suitors, including a popular cocktail, 'Love Me Tender,' made with gin and peach vodka. ... Summer is a time of hope for the unattached men of Nome,"" the article continues, ""a tough gold rush town of 3,500 people in Alaska's far western corner, where single men outnumber single women by almost two to one."" In 2012, the Washington Post sent two single female reporters to Alaska. ""The fishermen descend almost before we even make it through the door of the rattletrap bar. They beg us for a game of pool, conversation, anything."" These reporters didn't mean any harm, and I get that Alaska is rugged and strange. It really is the ""Last Frontier"" state, a remote place where plumbing isn't a given and people fend for themselves in extreme conditions. Alaska is no mecca for single ladies, though. Instead of gawking at the ratio, we should be talking about ending the violence. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John D. Sutter.","Alaska has the highest men-to-women ratio in the country .

"(CNN) -- If you're overweight, slimming down will make you feel great, right? For John Janetzko, embracing his own body took more than just weight loss. The 24-year-old chemistry Ph.D. candidate at Harvard is just under 6 feet tall, and struggled with his body image for years. Even after losing 125 pounds, he still felt fat, and pushed himself in unhealthy ways in terms of diet and fitness. These days, at a lean 165 pounds, Janetzko feels more confident and generally better about himself. ""I feel more generically attractive in terms of what society's views are,"" he said. ""But I guess I also feel like that was something I thought would be very quick, and would sort of happen right away."" Getting motivated . In childhood, Janetzko heard from his pediatrician that his weight wasn't healthy so many times that he became desensitized to it. But as his father remembers it, he wasn't ever really fat. Intense studying and bad eating habits piled on pounds during college. By the fall of junior year, Janetzko weighed about 290 pounds. ""I would always be sort of afraid of how I thought people would think of me,"" he said. ""I always expected my girlfriend at the time would find someone better."" The first stage of Janetzko's weight loss came when he lived at home in Toronto during college. A friend encouraged Janetzko to go to the gym with him, even offering to buy him running shoes. Janetzko started going to the gym often, focusing on jogging and light weights. Instead of greasy takeout meals from food stands, Janetzko started picking up leaner options such as grilled chicken and broccoli, and cooked more on weekends. His father helped cook when Janetzko was busy. ""I started with the idea that being very strict with my diet was the solution,"" he said. During his senior year, with graduate school applications and his father becoming ill, Janetzko slipped, forgoing the gym because there weren't enough hours in the day. His weight fluctuated, never quite bouncing back as high as it was, but still reversing some of the progress he had made. The move from Toronto to Cambridge, Massachusetts, and a breakup from a long relationship also distracted him from healthy eating. He was about 240 pounds when he entered Harvard. Graduate school jump-started his motivation again. He told himself: ""I've had so many changes, and it's really time to have an absolute fresh start."" How he did it . During the summer of 2011, Janetzko went to the gym consistently and cooked at least four nights a week. He had in his head a ""running clock"" of calorie and protein limits for meal times, aiming for about 2,000 calories a day. Breakfast was usually a protein shake. Lunch would be salad, sandwich or burrito. Dinner would be around 1,000 calories. By the end of autumn of his first year at Harvard, he was closer to 200 pounds. On a visit home to Toronto, he ran his first 5K race, which motivated him to keep working on his fitness. Janetzko also encouraged his roommates to go with him to exercise, and helped friends with their workouts and stretches. ""I guess that was a point where I was sort of feeling happy,"" he said. Focused on fitness, he competed in volleyball leagues, swam, and played squash and soccer. By mid-2012, he was down to 170 pounds. Losing those last 60 to 70 pounds in Massachusetts brought about the most substantial physical changes in his fitness journey. ""I said, 'What happened to you? Are they not feeding you?' "" his father, Rainer Janetzko, remembers telling his son when he first visited after the weight loss. Generally, though, Janetzko's new physique looks good, his father said. ""Now when he puts a suit on, he looks better."" Going too far . Slim and athletic as he was, Janetzko still didn't feel good about how he looked in May 2012. It was an awkward time he calls the ""transition"" -- when he had lost a lot of weight, but his new body didn't register in his mind as a positive image. ""I would wake up in the morning, look in the mirror and feel like 'Oh God, I'm fat and ugly and this is terrible,' "" he said. At the same time, others told him he had gotten too skinny and didn't need to get thinner. Objectively, he had reached his goal -- but he couldn't see that in his reflection. He thought his mirror image still needed to lose 10 or 20 more pounds. Focused on weight loss and fitness, Janetzko didn't pay close attention to his body's signals that it was being pushed too hard. As he ate less and started running farther and faster, Janetzko noticed he would start to get dizzy or even fall. Last semester he collapsed outside of a laboratory. ""That was a scary time for a lot of people -- my lab mates, my advisor and myself included,"" he said. ""If you don't balance your diet properly (you) can't go and work yourself really hard."" His aversion to overeating had gone too far -- his appetite for some foods had diminished. Friends even wondered if he had an eating disorder. ""There were days when I could barely finish half a sandwich,"" he said. ""I felt full but I clearly had not taken in all of the calories I need as a functioning person."" He has since gone to nutritionists for help. He isn't as rigid about what he eats anymore, and is more flexible about his workouts. He still minimizes fried foods but tries to be more varied with meals. The Cut: What no one tells you about losing lots of weight . Embracing a new self . Body image disturbance isn't unusual when people lose weight, said Emily Sandoz, assistant professor of psychology at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. Often people have huge expectations about the life changes that will result from a weight loss that don't actually happen. ""Their experience of themselves as fat extends far beyond their actual body,"" she said. ""People have to learn how to be in their skin in a new way."" Sandoz's approach to helping people with body image problems is to shift the focus to other areas of their lives that they care about, such as work or parenting. Mindfulness -- the idea of being present and in the moment -- is incorporated in her approach to helping clients be more accepting of their bodies. Can mindfulness help manage pain and mental illness? Over time, Janetzko has been able to reconcile his weight with his body image -- but there was no one moment where it suddenly clicked. Positive reinforcement from others and self-assurance have helped him feel better about himself. His message to others . Many of Janetzko's old friends who see his recent photos on Facebook have contacted him to ask: ""How did you do it?"" Janetzko's bottom line is that he was intensely motivated. ""If you count your calories and you're like, 'I want to lose weight,' you're going to be stuck in that forever,"" he said. ""But I think if you can make changes in your lifestyle that you actually want to be doing, and then you'll do those no matter what -- you enjoy them -- then you never have to feel like you're trapped in a routine.""","John Janetzko weighed 290 pounds in college .
He overhauled his diet and fitness to lose weight .
Even at 170 pounds he wasn't feeling great about his body image .

"(CNN) -- A federal judge ruled Wednesday that North Dakota's abortion law, considered one of the most restrictive in the nation, is unconstitutional. The law banned most abortions after six weeks, when a fetal heartbeat can be first detected. ""The North Dakota strict ban on abortions at the time when a 'heartbeat' has been detected -- essentially banning all abortions as early as six weeks of pregnancy -- cannot withstand a constitutional challenge,"" U.S. District Judge Daniel L. Hovland wrote in his decision. ""A woman's constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy before viability has been recognized by the United States Supreme Court for more than 40 years. The United States Supreme Court has clearly determined the dispositive issue presented in this lawsuit. This court is not free to impose its own view of the law."" The law, thought to be the nation's toughest anti-abortion measure, was signed by the state's governor last year. ""Although the likelihood of this measure surviving a court challenge remains in question, this bill is nevertheless a legitimate attempt by a state legislature to discover the boundaries of Roe v. Wade,"" Gov. Jack Dalrymple said then. He called the constitutionality of the law ""an open question,"" saying the Supreme Court has never considered the ""precise restriction"" of the fetal heartbeat aspect. The governor was not immediately available to comment on Wednesday's decision. The Center for Reproductive Rights cheered the ruling. ""The court was correct to call this law exactly what it is: a blatant violation of the constitutional guarantees afforded to all women. But women should not be forced to go to court, year after year in state after state, to protect their constitutional rights. ""We hope today's decision, along with the long line of decisions striking down these attempts to choke off access to safe and legal abortion services in the U.S., sends a strong message to politicians across the country that our rights cannot be legislated away,"" said Nancy Northup, that group's president and CEO. The ruling was also praised by the director of the Red River Women's Clinic, the only clinic providing abortions in North Dakota. ""The decision is a sigh of relief for us and the women we serve. It's not a surprise. We fully expected the decision to go our way but it's always nice when it finally happens,"" said Tammi Kromenaker. Abortion was legalized in all 50 states in 1973 by the U.S. Supreme Court. Statutory time limits on when abortions can take place, however, vary from state to state. Under Roe v. Wade, abortions are generally permitted until the fetus is considered viable, or able to live outside the womb. Some states have no time limit, while others allow abortion up to the end of the second trimester, about 27 or 28 weeks into the pregnancy. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report.","Abortion was legalized in all 50 states in 1973 by the U.S. Supreme Court .

"(CNN) -- A sheriff says he's closer to finding the motive behind the fatal shooting of a Louisiana pastor who witnesses say was killed by a former deacon as the horrified congregation looked on. Calcasieu Parish Sheriff Tony Mancuso said Tuesday the alleged gunman's wife had filed a rape complaint with police against Tabernacle of Praise Worship Center pastor Ronald Harris on September 25, two days before the shooting. In the complaint, the woman said Harris had raped her several months ago, according to Mancuso. He declined to release the report, saying it was part of the murder investigation against former church deacon Woodrow Karey. Mancuso said he had not determined whether a rape had occurred. Witnesses told police that Karey walked into the Tabernacle of Praise Worship Center around 8:20 p.m. Friday and shot Harris twice -- the first time as Karey entered the church and then again at close range after Harris had fallen to the floor. Deputies arrested Karey after he called 911 and told the dispatcher what he had done. He is charged with second-degree murder. Karey told authorities that a week earlier he'd found text messages from his wife to the pastor. He believed, Mancuso said, that they were having sex and he confronted his wife. Days after the confrontation, Karey's wife filed the police report accusing the pastor of rape, Mancuso said. Authorities had not yet investigated the rape accusation by Karey's wife. ""We had not had an opportunity yet,"" Mancuso said. ""Before we go to an accuser, we like to get the facts straight before we begin questioning."" Talisha Harris, the pastor's daughter, was in the church when her father was gunned down. She said Karey entered the Lake Charles church as she was leading the 65 people in the sanctuary in the singing of ""Our God is a Great God."" Karey fired his shotgun almost immediately, hitting a plant, Talisha Harris said. The second shotgun blast struck Ronald Harris in the back. Then, Karey approached the fallen pastor, fired once more and ""stood there to watch him take his last breath,"" she said. The gunman ran, leaving a church in chaos. ""People were screaming,"" Talisha Harris said. ""They were under the pews."" The slain pastor's son, Ronald Harris Jr., told CNN Monday that the family was ""trying to be strong."" He said his father and Karey had been close friends. Armed in church . While rare, church violence is not unheard of. In 2012, a former maintenance employee fatally shot a church volunteer at a house of worship just outside of Atlanta. Earlier that year, six people were killed at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin by a white supremacist who then killed himself. Shreveport, Louisiana, pastor Ed Gonzalez said he was once approached by someone in his office with apparently violent intent, CNN affiliate KSLA reported. ""He walked in my office and told me God told him to take me out,"" the station quoted Gonzalez as saying. The man eventually backed off, but the experience led Gonzalez to conclude the churches are easy targets. He now carries a weapon, as do several other members of his church. ""Pastors need to awake and realize that we live in a world of turmoil, hatred and bitterness, so they have to do something to protect those sheep,"" he told KSLA. ""As long as there is sin on this earth we're going to have violence."" CNN's Tina Burnside and Rick Martin contributed to this report.","NEW: Slain pastor's family ""trying to be strong,"" son says .

"(CNN) -- U.S. counterterrorism officials are closely watching an al Qaeda fighter in Pakistan who could become the next American to be targeted for killing by a drone strike, CNN has learned. The person has been the subject of debate among military commanders and intelligence officials for several weeks as they decide what to recommend. President Barack Obama would make a final decision. CNN has also learned key members of Congress have been aware of the internal debate. The officials spoke to CNN's Barbara Starr on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation. The current discussions involve both military commanders in the special forces community and intelligence officials. A key point being discussed is whether it is better to maintain surveillance to see what added intelligence can be gained about any threats to the United States, and whether additional monitoring might lead to other operatives or al Qaeda elements to target. Under the Obama administration's policy for targeting Americans, a person would have to pose an imminent threat to the United States and there would be no reasonable prospect of capture. A U.S. official said drone targeting inside Pakistan is very sensitive because of the fragile state of the Pakistani government, which is under pressure to ban such strikes. As a potential strike is weighed, some officials contend that good relations with the Islamabad government is a priority so the United States can maintain some type of long-term surveillance operation of potential al Qaeda targets there. If all U.S. troops leave neighboring Afghanistan at the end of 2014, the concern is it may be harder to maintain high priority efforts such as conducting further drone operations over Pakistan and to also monitor Pakistan's nuclear programs. As the United States considers a strike in Pakistan, there are also recent indications that al Qaeda in Pakistan and its affiliate in Somalia, Al-Shabaab, have stepped up their links, a second official told CNN. Jehad Serwan Mostafa, an American citizen, is currently with Al-Shabaab. He is the highest-ranking American in the group, believed to be in a remote part of southern Somalia. The Justice Department currently has a $5 million reward on his head. CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruikshank said there are indications Mostafa has contacts with senior al Qaeda leadership in Pakistan. The United States failed to kill Al Shabaab leader Ahmed Abdi Godane in a drone strike in southern Somalia just a few weeks ago. And last October, Navy SEALs failed to capture a third key leader, a man named Ikrimah. They assaulted a compound he was said to be at in southern Somalia but withdrew under heavy fire. Although Ikrimah and Godane were said to be involved in the deadly attack last year on a shopping mall in Kenya, U.S. officials have told CNN that one reason Ikrimah was targeted was there was critical intelligence he had been communicating with operatives of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. That Yemen based al Qaeda group is considered the most dangerous of its affiliates to U.S. security. Former official says U.S. justified . The Obama administration would be justified using drones to kill American terrorists abroad and at home, former U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales told CNN on Tuesday. ""They've been very, very effective in the war on terror,"" the former George W. Bush appointee told CNN's ""New Day."" ""It's a wonderful technology."" Two key decisions would be involved -- whether to put an American on a kill list and whether to execute on the kill order, said Gonzales, who is now in private practice with a law firm in Nashville. ""As to the second, I think the President has the authority -- as the commander in chief -- once you identify where an 'enemy combatant' is, to take action, to take him out on the battlefield like you would any other enemy,"" he said. Due process would be a concern only in designating someone as an ""enemy combatant,"" he said. Once that decision has been made, ""then the commander in chief should be able to execute on that order at the moment of his choosing, because you never know when you might locate that individual -- you might only have minutes, you might only have hours."" But the administration has reportedly taken months to decide whether to target someone, a pace that might wind up working against it, Gonzales said. ""I think the courts are going to ask, if they finally take up this issue, you have months to make this determination, why isn't there more due process given to the individual, to the American citizen?"" Americans targeted before . The United States has targeted an American before, most notably Yemeni-American cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, a key member of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula killed by a drone in 2011. Another American, Samir Khan, was killed in the same strike, though he was not the target of the operation. Khan was behind al Qaeda's English-language Inspire magazine, which aimed to influence jihadis and wannabe jihadis around the world. ""What I would worry about is that the courts have seemed to indicate that, when you're talking about the rights of American citizens, there are certain due process considerations that have to be taken into account before you designate someone as an enemy combatant,"" Gonzales said. ""I would have advised the President that Al-Awlaki is an enemy combatant and, Mr. President, you do have the authority to take him out in a drone strike. But I would also caution that, given recent Supreme Court decisions, I'm not sure there are five votes on the court that would agree with that assessment."" Gonzales, who supported the Bush administration's policies that many derided as torture, said Congress' continued funding of anti-terrorism efforts ""indicates tacit agreement that the war on terror can continue, and that these kinds of actions are in fact lawful."" He noted that Congress gets periodic briefings on such matters and ""apparently has no issues, no major problems with these kinds of tactics."" Asked whether drones might be used to kill Americans who have been determined to be pressing, imminent threats to U.S. safety on U.S. soil, Gonzales said doing so was probable, even though it might worry civil libertarians. ""It's very likely that we're going to confront more terrorists here in this country; it's very likely they are going to be American citizens. And if, in fact, this is an effective technology, why wouldn't you use this technology to eliminate this threat?"" ACLU says government abusing power . The American Civil Liberties Union contends the administration abuses its power, particularly when it comes to drone strikes. ""Even in the context of an armed conflict against an armed group, the government may use lethal force only against individuals who are directly participating in hostilities against the United States,"" the group says on its website. ""Regardless of the context, whenever the government uses lethal force, it must take all possible steps to avoid harming civilian bystanders. But these are not the standards that the executive branch is using."" Unofficial estimates based on reports by human rights groups and media accounts indicate the Obama administration has carried out hundreds of drone strikes that have killed hundreds and perhaps thousands of people, including civilians, in an escalation of the practice the Bush administration started. Most have occurred in Afghanistan, but others have taken place in countries with no ground war, including Yemen, where al-Awlaki was killed. Critics say the government oversteps the legal boundaries of the Constitution and international law, particularly by making decisions on targeted killings in secret without going before any court. Hina Shamsi, who directs the ACLU's National Security Project, told CNN that the Obama administration was ""fighting hard"" to prevent a judicial review of the strikes that killed al-Awlaki and the other Americans, including the terrorist's 16-year-old son. Until allegations in classified documents can be assessed in court, she said, the question of whether they amount to real evidence remains unanswered. Shamsi called the U.S. actions ""one of the most extreme and dangerous forms of authority that the executive branch can claim -- the power to kill people based on vague and shifting legal standards, secret evidence and no judicial review even after the fact."" Critics: Obama's anti-terrorism strategy confusing . Obama has insisted his responsibility as commander in chief to protect Americans from attack justified targeted killings such as the drone strike on al-Awlaki. In a May speech, he rejected targeting an American citizen without what he called due process, meaning adherence to full legal procedures. Critics, including congressional Republicans, argue the President's anti-terrorism strategy, which in many ways extended programs and practices started under the Bush administration, have failed to curtail al Qaeda. Asked last week at a congressional hearing if al Qaeda was stronger or weaker than before the 9/11 attacks, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper conceded the terrorist network was more widespread.

"(CNN) -- Every now and then, being a jerk on the Internet can result in some unwanted attention. From 2009 to 2013, the operators of Jerk.com created profiles for millions of people, including children, using information that was scraped off Facebook, according to charges filed Monday by the Federal Trade Commission. The site continues to operate. The profiles, which were supposedly created by users of the site, labeled people a ""Jerk"" or ""Not a Jerk."" Also, the site claimed -- falsely, according to the FTC -- that the subjects could edit their profiles if they paid a $30 membership fee. The complaint says that, in fact, operators of the site created more than 73 million profiles with Facebook information, some of which had been posted as private and which included intimate images such as parents bathing their young children and a mother breast-feeding. Many users who paid to join the site received nothing in return, according to the FTC. ""In today's interconnected world, people are especially concerned about their reputation online, and this deceptive scheme was a brazen attempt to exploit those concerns,"" said Jessica Rich, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection. An attorney for Jerk.com did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment. But in a document from last year seeking to dismiss the case, Maria Crimi Speth called the government's case against the site a ""fishing expedition."" She wrote that profiles on the site, which received almost 100,000 visitors a day, are created by users and that profiles generally display ""information that is publicly available in a Google Internet search as well as newly created user generated content."" She also said that the site deleted profiles of children 14 and younger if those profiles were brought to their attention. The document also claimed that, in 2012, only 22 people subscribed to the site and its total revenue was about $3,000. Jerk.com profiles included buttons that allowed users to vote on whether someone was a ""jerk"" or not, as well as add personal information and comments about that person. In some cases, the FTC said, those comments were ""derisive and abusive."" The FTC says that the site created phony Facebook apps that operators then used to download the names and photos of millions of users. The commission is seeking a court order barring the ""deceptive practices,"" prohibiting Jerk.com from using information they obtained improperly and requiring them to delete profiles created from scraped Facebook information.","FTC announces Monday that it has cracked down on Jerk.com .

"(CNN) -- With at least two winners sharing a prize of more than a half-billion dollars, Tuesday's Mega Millions lottery may have drawn more players than any previous drawing. But they may be the lucky ones, in more ways than you think. Related: Woman is Georgia winner of $648 million Mega Millions jackpot . Most of those who play know they have little chance of winning anything. Ever. And most of them probably can't afford to play, anyway. Still, they line up to place their dollars on the counter, all for a snowball's chance at an instant miracle, even as that miracle has gotten harder to attain. Lotteries and games of chance such as the Mega Millions, or more traditional casinos, have come in vogue among politicians seeking to raise revenues without raising taxes. This seems like a net win all around — players receive the entertainment of playing and we all enjoy the benefits of higher funding for schools or other public works. Unfortunately the reality is not so rosy. Related: You won the big one -- now what? Those in poverty or near poverty not only are more likely to play the lottery than those with greater means, they also spend a larger percent of their money on average on these games of chance. Some have argued that this may not be such a bad thing if the poor basically play the lottery as a cheap form of entertainment. However, when we look for the telltale signs of entertainment behavior, they are absent. We don't see evidence that changes in the availability or price of other entertainment, movies for example, lead to changes in lotto purchases. Rather, we find there are big jumps in lottery purchases when the poverty rate increases, when unemployment increases, or when people enroll on welfare. Lottery playing among the poor is a Hail Mary investment strategy — a small ray of hope among the hopeless. But this false hope is, by design, an attempt to lure the emotional decision-maker. Recent changes in the Mega Millions lottery have reduced the chances of winning in order to increase the size of the jackpot. By changing the range of the six possible numbers drawn -- from between 1 and 56 to between 1 and 75 -- the already improbable odds of 1 in 176 million have diminished to a virtually impossible 1 in 259 million. Fewer big winners means larger jackpots, more hype and more players. And more money for the lotteries. Related: $800 million in lottery prizes unclaimed . Such changes have occurred as the lottery commissions have become expert in swindling players out of their money. Humans aren't particularly good at dealing with risks and gambles. We tend to believe that rare events are more common than they truly are. Moreover, we don't discern between small changes in very low probabilities. Thus, few will have noticed that the odds of winning the lottery reduced from 0.000000006 to 0.000000004 for any given ticket. But our eyes are drawn to the steadily increasing prizes—prizes that are now designed to eventually exceed $1 billion. Such astronomical amounts draw in even those who consider themselves very prudent. When the prizes get this large, many start to rationalize the purchase of a ticket. In the end, there are few who win money, and many who simply lose a few dollars with nothing to show for it. But those few dollars add up. For example, the average annual per capita spending on lottery tickets in Massachusetts is nearly $800. That is $800 being spent for every man, woman and child in the state. That is more than six times the average per capita food stamp benefit. Some of this $800 goes to schools, constituting about 1-2% of school budgets in many states. The majority of this $800, however, goes to a very small number of lucky winners who take home what seems like infinite wealth that is sure to change their life forever. Or not so much. Related: No lotteries in these 7 states . Approximately one third of lottery winners will declare bankruptcy. This happens primarily because new winners are so unfamiliar with the magnitude of the money they have won, that they simply overestimate the purchasing power. How could I ever need to budget when I have several hundred million in the bank? The overwhelming majority of lottery winners don't believe they are better off for having won. One study finds that recent lottery winners have lower levels of happiness than do those who have recently become quadriplegic. Apparently, winning the lottery is not what the hype would have you believe. Personally, I would probably prefer an $800 tax. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David R. Just.","At least two people will share the $648 million jackpot from Tuesday's Mega Millions lottery .

"(CNN) -- Punching down the grapes. Digging up the clams. Harvesting the sugar cane. Harvest isn't just picking pumpkins for Halloween. Typically the back-breaking work of farm employees pushing against time to store the fruits of their labor before winter comes, harvest has also become a theme for travelers who want a taste of the bounty -- without all the work. Travelers vacationing during the fall harvest can celebrate all sorts of different food stuffs ripe for the picking (or digging, in some cases). And if you simply want the seasonal food brought to your dinner table, there are options for you. When autumn leaves fall . Vintner for the day . While guests will certainly enjoy sipping from the 12,000-bottle wine cellar at the Bacara Resort & Spa's restaurant, the resort also offers the opportunity to get dirty with the grapes. Guests can work with Santa Barbara's top winemakers, walking through a vineyard, sorting grapes and helping with the punch downs. The program is scheduled to continue through the end of November and depends upon the availability of slots at nearby wineries, which may include Brewer-Clifton, Carhartt Vineyard and Harrison Clarke Wine. ""Bacara Crush is designed to not only take our guests behind the scenes of harvest, but allow them to participate in the process,"" Kathleen Cochran, general manager of Bacara Resort & Spa, said in a statement. The $695 price per couple includes a tour guide, transportation, an approximately 8 a.m.-1 p.m. work day, wine tastings and a gourmet picnic at the vineyard. (It does not include rooms, which start at $299/night in October and November.) The sugar cane harvest . The Middleton Place National Historic Landmark in Charleston, South Carolina, showcases 18th- and 19th-century plantation life, with costumed interpreters doing the work once performed by enslaved African-Americans. During the Plantation Days weekend of November 10-11, the interpreters will harvest and press the plantation's small sugar cane crop. While visitors can't help with the sugar cane because of safety issues, there are other hands-on activities, including processing Carolina Gold rice and working with Sea Island Cotton. Visitors who stay at the Inn at Middleton Place will receive tickets to Middleton Place included in the price of their stay. Visit Middleton Place's website for specifics on activities and demos. Picnic on the Appalachian Trail . The Grand Bohemian Hotel Asheville's ""Picnics on the Parkway"" package makes it easy to enjoy the seasonal offerings of North Carolina farms while picnicking on one of the country's most famous trails. Picnics on the Parkway, starting at $394/night, includes the room, breakfast for two, a pocket guide of North Carolina birds, a 3-D topography map to the Blue Ridge Parkway and a picnic basket filled with food from southern farms and the local farmer's market. To sample all that Asheville's local and seasonal restaurant scene has to offer, head to this North Carolina independent food mecca for ""Taste of Asheville"" on November 14. For a more traditional fall experience, head to the Historic Orchard at Altapass, an 104-year-old apple orchard located on the Blue Ridge Parkway. The orchard also offers fresh fudge, honey from its hives, hayrides and a Butterfly Conservation Center to keep the kids busy. Digging for dinner . Not all harvesting goes on in the fields. Add seafood to the list of what can be harvested in the fall on Prince Edward Island. (Clamming isn't restricted to fall; clammers can dig whenever the shore isn't frozen). Novice clammers can dig for dinner with Experience PEI's experienced clam diggers, who will take you on expeditions through the end of October. The company's ""digging for dinner"" excursion takes place on the western part of beautiful Prince Edward Island, where the group learns how to find the clams and how to dig without damaging the shells. After the group has enough for ""a feed of clams,"" the diggers retire to a restored train caboose, where the lead digger steams up the clams and serves your catch fresh. ""Our clam diggers are wonderful characters in their own right, great storytellers in their own right,' says Bill Kendrick, co-owner of Experience PEI. Reservations are recommended for the 2-3 hour trip, but the meeting time will vary by availability of Kendrick's diggers, the time of low tide and the weather. Prices range from $65-$85 per person depending on group size. Experience PEI; 1-866-887-3238 . Enjoying fruits of the harvest . If you prefer to let others do the harvesting for you, dine on the fruits of the harvest at Boston Harbor Hotel, where hotel guests and locals alike can enjoy tea poured into your cup (not into the harbor). The waterfront hotel's chef Daniel Bruce is offering a Fall Harvest Tea through November 29. ""Fall is my favorite season,"" says Bruce, in an email. ""The colors, aromas and ingredients all contribute to setting the tone for a perfect tea."" Bruce's tea menu infuses the flavors of fall into sweet and savory items. ""The Maple Smoked Salmon tea sandwiches have a wonderful smokiness, while the tartness of the freshly picked apples perfectly complements the roasted chicken in the apple chicken salad tea sandwiches,"" he says. ""And, of course, everyone loves pumpkin and walnuts in desserts for autumn."" Bruce, who serves his Harvest Teas in the hotel's Rowes Wharf Sea Grille, also offers Halloween, Christmas and other seasonal teas. The harvest tea costs $39 for adults and $25 for children.","Fall reminds travelers of nature's bounty .

"Brattleboro, Vermont (CNN) -- The skies may have cleared, but an assessment of damage has only just begun. Officials from President Barack Obama's administration will travel Tuesday to Virginia, North Carolina and Vermont -- some of the hardest-hit states -- to survey ongoing response efforts, according to the Department of Homeland Security. The storm known as Irene left parts of the U.S. East Coast grappling with dangerous floodwaters and widespread power outages. At least 27 deaths in nine states have been blamed on Irene, which fizzled to a post-tropical cyclone and headed over eastern Canada Monday. Flooding was ongoing, particularly in New England, said Craig Fugate, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Upstate New York, New Jersey and Vermont endured some of the worst flooding. ""A lot of the activities are moving into recovery phases, but we are still very concerned about the flooding,"" Fugate told reporters Monday. Southern states were affected primarily by power outages and the effects of the storm surge, particularly on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, where Highway 12 had been chopped into pieces in several places by the pounding surf. As of Monday afternoon, about 5 million customers were without power, Fugate said, citing figures from the Department of Energy. That was down from about 6 million earlier, he said. In New York, torrential rains washed out roads and bridges, flooding homes and some businesses. The town of Prattsville was struck particularly hard. In Vermont, the governor warned that further flooding and loss of life are likely for the small, rural state. While small brooks have crested, large rivers have not, he said. ""It's just devastating,"" Gov. Peter Shumlin said. ""Whole communities under water, businesses, homes, obviously roads and bridges, rail transportation infrastructure. We've lost farmers' crops. We're tough folks up here but Irene ... really hit us hard."" David Vallee, a hydrologist for the National Weather Service in charge of the Northeastern forecast center in Taunton, Massachusetts, said rainfall reached 15 inches in some places. The fact that much of the affected area was already heavily saturated by rainfall in the weeks prior to Irene made things worse, he said. Moderate to major flooding was occurring from New York into the Connecticut Valley, through much of northern New Hampshire ""and a good chunk of Vermont."" Many of the river crests set records, he said. In New Jersey. an array of rivers and creeks eclipsed flood stages and continued to rise Monday. ""We're seeing record flooding levels across the northern part of our state. Nine river locations have reached or passed record flooding levels,"" New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie told reporters. Asked how FEMA has changed its approach to handling disasters six years after Hurricane Katrina laid waste to much of the Gulf Coast, Fugate said the agency now has more authority to act prior to receiving a request from a governor. That translates into ""not having to wait"" until the impact of the storm is clear. ""We have to act quickly and be prepared to support that,"" he said. In Washington, Obama vowed, ""We will make sure folks have all the support they need."" He added that ""it will take time"" to recover. Residents from North Carolina through New England will need that support, with homes, businesses, roads and bridges torn apart by floodwaters. Some of the worst flooding since 1927 ravaged Vermont's normally tranquil countryside, turning babbling brooks into turbulent rivers and knocking homes from their foundations. In Wilmington, Vermont, a young woman who had been standing near a river was swept away by the water. Her body was recovered Monday. One person is still missing in Vermont and feared dead, authorities said. In all, 260 roads were affected, many of them underwater, Vermont's Emergency Management Agency said Monday. The emergency management headquarters flooded overnight and was evacuated and relocated from Waterbury to Burlington, approximately 20 miles away. ""We never see this sort of thing in Vermont,"" said Jesse Stone of White River Junction, where a covered bridge was flooded. ""For the people who are saying that Irene was disappointing, maybe, because they didn't get the sort of wind and damage they expected, I just want to remind them that, in places like Vermont, we really got it pretty hard."" In North Carolina, about 250,000 customers were without power Monday, down from more than 440,000 on Sunday night, the state's division of emergency management said. Connecticut Light & Power reported Monday evening that an estimated half million people had no power. Some customers might have to wait a week or more because of damage to the system. But life along much of the East Coast returned to normal, as subway services resumed on all 22 lines in New York City, and the three major airports in the area reopened after thousands of flights were canceled over the weekend. Flight schedules were expected to normalize slowly, and passengers were urged to check with their airlines before going to the airport. Amtrak canceled many trains, but had some service in the Northeast. Officials reported six deaths in North Carolina, four in Virginia, five in Pennsylvania, three each in New York and Vermont, two each in Connecticut and New Jersey and one each in Maryland and Florida. The U.S. government estimates that the cost from wind damage alone will exceed $1 billion. Analysts have put the total anticipated cost of Irene much higher.

Norman, Poppy Harlow, Divina Mims, Rob Marciano, Rose Arce, Jeanne Meserve, Chris Boyette, David Mattingly, Susan Candiotti, Greg Botelho, Phil Gast, Ed Payne, Ric Ward and Justine Redman contributed to this report.","NEW: Obama administration officials will visit hard-hit areas on Tuesday .

"OLD FORGE, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- My best friend from childhood is Italian-American. Very Italian-American. So when Mary Immaculata Ferrario Rinaldi invites me to visit the Pizza Capital of the World, I don't ask questions. She knows pizza. Arrive early or make reservations to sample Old Forge's pizza. We head out of Scranton, Pennsylvania, toward Old Forge, population approximately 10,000. In about 10 minutes we're driving down Main Street. I start counting the pizza cafés, as they call them here: Rinaldi's, Brutico's, Arcaro & Genell's, Anthony's, Ghigiarelli's -- 11 on this street alone. Within just a few blocks, there are at least nine more. Even the florist on Main Street is called ""Pizzazz."" Mary said we would need reservations, and she's right. It's 4:30 p.m. and Revello's is packed. The place attracts locals and celebrities. Hillary Clinton was here a couple of weeks ago. Just for fun we ask if we can sit in the booth where she sat. ""No problem, honey,"" the waitress, Dorothy, says. Now, if you are thinking regular pizza, forget it. This is Old Forge pizza and all the cafés here make it. It's not round, it's rectangular and it's ""red"" or ""white."" Red is made with tomato sauce and cheese; white is cheese only, double crust, with olive oil and rosemary sprinkled on top, although they recently introduced a new version with broccoli. Old Forge also is famous for ""black"" pizza, my favorite. No tomato sauce. Just cheese, black pepper, olives and anchovies. While Dorothy is getting our sodas, I meet Pat Revello. He's the co-owner with his mother, Delores. His parents bought the café 41 years ago. I ask him if they have the best pizza in town. Bad question. No one here in town claims to be the best. There's very little competition. After all, Old Forge, Pat says, is a place ""where everyone knows your name."" ""Well, it's really a matter of taste,"" he tells me. The pizza café owners in Old Forge are a loyal bunch. Most of their families originally came from the same town in Italy -- Felitto, near Naples. The owners advertise together. They named their town the ""Pizza Capital of the World."" No one is ""best,"" they say. They're all ""the best."" So, what make the best pizza in the world? Pat takes me back to the kitchen. Andy Sopp, who has worked here for 40 years, is sprinkling grated cheese on a ""red"" pizza. Next to him is a stack of pizza crusts.  He's the brother of the owner. Of the café's 25 employees, three-quarters of them are related. I ask Andy for the secret of great pizza. ""It's the cheese blend,"" he says. ""So what kind do you use?"" I ask. ""We make our own,"" he says, ""We have to keep our secrets."" Pat tells me they use only fresh ingredients and grind their own California tomatoes. They still use the original cheese grater from 40 years ago. Local legend has it that Old Forge pizza began 88 years ago with grandmother Ghigiarelli, whose family restaurant, Ghigiarelli's, still stands on Main Street.  Mrs. Ghigiarelli lived below a gentlemen's club where the clients played cards. They asked her for something to eat. She grabbed a rectangular baking pan and baked a pizza on the old coal stove. The rest is history. Today, some Old Forge cafés ship their pizza across the country and around the world. It's 5:30 p.m. and the line of customers at Revello's is out the front door. At the back door there's a crowd waiting for takeout. Pat tells me his first worker gets in at 5 a.m. to make the dough. ""Once the dough starts rising, the people come in,"" he says. Waitress Dorothy comes by to freshen up our drinks. She's on the run, trying to keep the customers happy. ""I wish I had another hand instead of a mouth,"" she says.

"(CNN) -- The tiny Caribbean nation of Grenada is more often associated with its unforgiving hurricane season and at times turbulent political history, however this week the island will be hoping that all the conditions are right for sailing. The 2012 Grenada Sailing Festival begins on Friday with races around the southern and eastern coasts, in waters the organizers say are some of the most challenging in the Caribbean. It is that same water that attracts visitors to the region. The crystal blue sea is a haven for sailors, swimmers and scuba divers, keen to race, relax and explore in the island that is known for being a yachting destination. Twenty one miles long and 12 miles wide, Grenada lies just north of Trinidad and Tobago. The island declared independence from Great Britain in 1974, and today, much of its culture reflects the African roots of the black majority. Grenada is more commonly known as the ""Spice Island"" and is a major exporter of cinnamon and nutmeg. Climate . Around 110, 000 people call Grenada home, with the largest town St George's having one of the Caribbean's most picturesque waterfronts. With the average temperatures teetering around the mid-to late 20s (degrees), the climate is perfect to enjoy the outdoors and gaze out towards the ocean. However the region is not immune to hurricanes. Its long hurricane season, stretching from June until November, can sometimes be deadly. In 2004, Hurricane Ivan ripped through the area, killing dozens in the region and causing widespread damage. Sailing . If the festival inspires yachting enthusiasts to set sail, then there are plenty of marinas and inlets to dock for overnight stays. Eight marinas are dotted around the Grenada, and little inlets offer boats a sheltered place to drop an anchor. The festival centers around Port Louis Marina, just outside the capital. Joshua Yetman, a photographer who lives on the island said, ""Society here isn't based on class or cash-flow - and those lack of barriers is openly evident during the sailing festival. Million dollar sailing yachts are crewed by visitors and locals alike. ""On any given vessel you might find a teacher, a doctor, an investment banker, or a leather-skinned yachtie who travels from festival to festival."" Diving . The crystal clear water of Grenada makes the island's surrounds ideal for diving. Reefs, shipwrecks and a sculpture park are features of the underwater world. Read more: The world's weirdest places to scuba dive . Within the island's protected marine area is Happy Valley, where authorities say divers will find a plethora of reef fish. But it's not just the natural beauty that's said to captivate. The Bianca C shipwreck has been called the 'Titanic of the Caribbean'. The luxury liner sank outside the capital's harbor more than half a century ago and has since become a spectacular dive site. The sculptures under the sea is another of the breathtaking man-made sites. They were created by renowned English artist Jason de Caires Taylor to promote conservation awareness. Beaches . Undoubtedly a highlight of Grenada, people are divided as to which beach is the best. But one thing they do agree on is that with turquoise water the glides up the long stretches of white sand, the beaches are idyllic. Visitors who are hungry for the typical Grenadian experience should head to Grand Anse where bars and restaurants are sandwiched between the clear waters and surrounding hills. Sydney: Making the most of Australia's 'harbor city' The fashion conscious should try the beach resort of Laluna which is co-owned by an Italian fashion publicist. Famous fashion names are said to have stayed in the cottages along the beach.

"(CNN) -- Robert De Niro says it was his ""responsibility"" to make a documentary about his father, artist Robert De Niro Sr., he told Out magazine in an interview. De Niro's father was a gay man who divorced De Niro's mother when the actor was a child. The elder De Niro is the subject of a new documentary, ""Remembering the Artist: Robert De Niro, Sr.,"" which premieres on HBO June 9. (HBO, like CNN, is a unit of Time Warner.) In a chat with Out, De Niro says that though he and his father weren't close -- he grew up with his mother -- the senior De Niro had a profound influence on his actor son. De Niro wants to pay tribute in the documentary, partly for the sake of his own children. ""We were not the type of father and son who played baseball together, as you can surmise. But we had a connection,"" he said. ""I wasn't with him a lot, because my mother and he were separated and divorced. ... But my father wasn't a bad father, or absent. He was absent in some ways. He was very loving. He adored me ... as I do my kids."" De Niro Sr. was an abstract expressionist painter who was part of an art community that also produced Jackson Pollock, Willem De Kooning and Mark Rothko. As his son notes, when De Niro Sr. had his studio in downtown Manhattan, an area now full of multimillion-dollar apartments, the area was ""Siberia."" De Niro Sr. died in 1993 and his son has maintained his studio in New York's SoHo neighborhood ever since. ""This space is here, and in 20 years, people won't know what a real space like this will be unless it was in a museum and they recreated it,"" he said. He had the contents catalogued and has kept them intact. He says he was only dimly aware of his father's sexuality growing up. ""I was not aware, much, of it. I wish we had spoken about it much more. My mother didn't want to talk about things in general, and you're not interested when you're a certain age,"" he said. But both his father and mother gave him the drive to succeed, he added. ""When I was young, I wasn't afraid of being told 'No,'"" he said. ""I tell my kids, I tell everyone, 'If you don't go, you never know.' I didn't take it as rejection. Certain things are stacked against you. You're coming out of nowhere, starting out â€” that's part of the excitement of it in a way, too."" In the film, De Niro also reads from his father's diaries, which he's still working through, he said. He may share more of them publicly -- ""That's part of his legacy, too,"" he said -- though he wants to talk to others first. But the important thing, he said, is getting the whole story out. ""You can't hide anything. That's the whole point -- the truth. That's what people are attracted to,"" the actor said. ""I should have done this 10 years earlier, but I'm glad I did it now.""

"(CNN) -- ""MasterChef"" runner-up Joshua Marks was in ""the battle of his life fighting mental illness"" when he killed himself Friday, his family said Sunday. His family blames the lack of mental health treatment facilities and the easy access to guns as factors in his tragic death. ""It is overwhelming to think that with proper, intensive treatment, Joshua may still be with us,"" his lawyer, Lisa Butler, said Sunday. ""He was a jewel with so much talent to offer this world. But, in his state of mind, he turned to the streets for a gun and easily got it."" Marks, 26, died from a gunshot wound to his head. His death has been ruled a suicide, a spokesman for the Cook County, Illinois, medical examiner said Sunday. He was charged with aggravated battery in July after scuffling with police officers who were called to the scene after he suffered serious facial wounds from a self-inflicted gunshot, according to his lawyer. His mother believed that incident was a call for help, not a suicide attempt, Butler said. But getting Marks help was not easy because of the lack of full-time mental health facilities in Illinois that would accept his insurance, she said. Marks' mother, Paulette Mitchell, found him dead in an alley on Chicago's south side Friday evening after a neighbor called to say he was walking around with a gun, Butler said. His family is now hoping to help others suffering from mental illness by talking about what happened to Marks in the three months since his arrest, she said. 'The battle of his life' Marks -- who, at 7 feet 2 inches tall, was known by friends as a ""gentle giant"" -- was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a year ago, the same month he lost to to winner Christine Ha in the final round of the Fox reality cooking competition's third season. A doctor diagnosed Marks with schizophrenia just last week, Butler said. ""Joshua was so kind, so gentle,"" his mother told CNN Sunday. ""He loved life. He loved people. He would never hurt anyone; never. He was just a gentle, sweet soul; but he hurt himself. That breaks my heart, that he hurt himself."" ""But, behind that huge smile, Josh was in the battle of his life fighting mental illness,"" a family statement said. ""It was extremely tough, but Josh was always positive, focused on his faith in God and determined to win; pushing forward through his illness to follow his passion for cooking and dream of being a renowned chef."" That battle apparently began just as Marks was achieving celebrity status on television. ""I hadn't noticed any signs of anything wrong or any mental illness until after Josh completed filming 'MasterChef,'"" his mother said. ""The time he was away filming was extremely stressful on him."" Marks' stepfather Gabriel Mitchell, in a statement to CNN, described ""the toll that being on a reality show puts on people."" ""Josh had a following of fans and was put on a 'celebrity' type pedestal, with the expectation from others that there was money and fame; but, his personal reality was that he was struggling mentally and financially,"" he said. ""I think people expect that you come away from a reality show and have it made. That's not necessarily the case."" Marks spoke about his mental illness in a public service video he recorded in February for the Make a Sound Project, a nonprofit suicide awareness project. The project promotes ""how to use music as an alternative to the crazy thoughts you may have going in your mind,"" Marks said in the video. ""Me, personally, I have bipolar disorder, so, you know, I'll get a little anxious sometimes. And how I cool out is, I listen to music and just listen to the words and just relax and, you know, find my melody. I wish we had some music going on in here right now."" 'A mental break' But last summer Marks suffered ""a mental break"" that led to his arrest on July 29, his lawyer said. Marks told police he had been possessed by ""MasterChef"" judge Gordon Ramsay, who turned him into God, the Chicago Tribune reported. ""What people don't know is that on the night Josh was arrested in July, he had just shot himself and had called police for help from the emergency phone,"" his mother said. ""He wasn't himself, he was in a manic state, calling the police to help him after having shot himself."" When police arrived, a scuffle ensued. ""They said that Josh lunged at them and attempted to disarm an officer,"" his other said. ""In addition to his gunshot wound to the face, Josh suffered a fractured jaw and injury to his face and head."" He was treated at a hospital for the facial and ear wounds caused by a bullet that he fired and then transferred to the Cook County Jail, where he was placed in the general population, his lawyer said. He got no mental health treatment and no medications while in jail, Butler said. ""I think people look at mental illness as if it is a crime instead of treating the illness,"" Gabriel Mitchell said. ""They knew of his mental illness, yet they throw him in jail with no treatment?"" His mother, a Chicago public elementary school teacher, bailed him out after more than a week. She desperately sought a full-time mental health program for Marks, but she could not find a one with an available bed, Butler said. ""After this, Josh was determined to get well,"" his mother said. Mitchell ""continually ran into roadblocks"" as she put her focus into finding help for her son, Butler said. ""Access to long-term, in-patient mental health care is extremely limited. How can you appropriately treat your loved one's mental health challenges if access to necessary care is virtually non-existent?"" She ""felt as if her hands were tied"" but ""she was doing everything she could to get him in treatment,"" Butler said. Mitchell enrolled her son in an outpatient program that was ""the best available through insurance,"" she said. A new diagnosis: Schizophrenia . That program concluded Thursday, with a doctor informing Marks that he believed he was suffering from schizophrenia. The new diagnosis upset him, Butler said. ""That's not what I am, that's not what I am,"" he told his mother, the lawyer said. ""He was very distraught by this new diagnosis,"" his mother said. ""He was just coming to terms with having been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but he just couldn't handle this new diagnosis."" Mitchell stayed home from her teaching job Friday to be with her son. ""I was concerned about him; he just wasn't himself, so I stayed with him at my dad's home Thursday night after we left the hospital and all day on Friday,"" she said. ""I only left for a couple of hours to pick up my daughter from school Friday afternoon."" She was stuck in Chicago's rush-hour traffic when she got a call from her brother saying that a neighbor saw her son walking around an alley with a gun. ""I rushed back to the south side to get to the neighborhood, and just started driving through the alleys near my dad's house looking for him,"" Mitchell said. ""All I could think was I have to get to him in time."" She frantically drove through alleys searching. ""I saw Joshua laying there in the second alley that I turned down,"" his mother said. ""I screamed for help and held him. I just didn't get to my boy on time. I didn't get to my boy."" Mitchell is determined to set up a foundation in her son's memory to help people with mental illness to address the same issues as Marks. ""I am not done, this is not over,"" she said. ""I am going to make sure that Josh's voice and dream live on by fighting for mental healthcare treatment."" While police work to trace how Marks got the handgun he used to kill himself, his family is also seeking answers. ""We live in a country where anyone can buy a gun on the streets at will,"" Butler said. ""We know that Josh paid little or no money for that gun, because he just didn't have it; he was unemployed and in treatment full time. So with no money, how did he get this gun?""

"(CNN) -- Retired Army Gen. John Shalikashvili, who rose from being an Army draftee to serving as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has died of complications from a stroke, his executive assistant said Saturday. He was 75. Shalikashvili died Saturday at Madigan Army Medical Center in Tacoma, Washington, according to assistant Rachel McLain. An open memorial service will be held on August 6 at the Tacoma Convention Center. A funeral will be held at a later date at Arlington National Cemetery. Born in Poland in 1936, Shalikashvili became the first foreign-born chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1993. He held the post until his retirement in 1997, serving under former President Bill Clinton, who awarded Shalikashvili the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Prior to that, he was NATO's 10th supreme allied commander in Europe. ""The United States has lost a genuine soldier-statesman whose extraordinary life represented the promise of America and the limitless possibilities that are open to those who choose to serve it,"" President Barack Obama said in a statement. ""From his arrival in the United States as a 16-year old Polish immigrant after the Second World War, to a young man who learned English from John Wayne movies, to his rise to the highest ranks of our military, Shali's life was an 'only in America' story."" Shalikashvili was drafted into the Army in 1958 and rose through the ranks, serving in Vietnam from 1968 to 1969 and heading up the 1991 international relief operation that airlifted food to and provided protection for the Kurds in northern Iraq. Obama said the general forged closer ties with Russia and improved the quality of life of U.S. service members and their families. Shalikashvili was granted U.S. citizenship after his family immigrated to Peoria, Illinois, from southern Germany, where they had sought refuge after the 1944 Warsaw Uprising in Poland. Shalikashvili suffered a stroke in 2004, but continued to work in several capacities. Most recently, he was in the news because of his support for a repeal of ""don't ask, don't tell,"" the ban of gays and lesbians serving openly in the U.S. military. He also had served as a visiting professor at the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University. The retired general is survived by his wife, Joan; their son, Brant; and other family members.","Obama says soldier-statesman represented promise of America .

"(CNN) -- Add Heart to the list of bands that are bowing out of a show at SeaWorld because of the CNN documentary ""Blackfish."" ""Heart has chosen to decline their forthcoming performance at SeaWorld on 2/9/14 due to the controversial documentary film 'Black Fish,'"" the band said Sunday on its verified Twitter account. Sisters Nancy and Ann Wilson did not elaborate. But the duo isn't the first to cancel a concert at the Florida theme park because of the film. Country singer Willie Nelson and Canadian rock act Barenaked Ladies also pulled the plug on their shows. ""While we're disappointed a small group of misinformed individuals was able to deny fans what would have been great concerts at SeaWorld by Heart, Barenaked Ladies and Willie Nelson,Â we respect the bands' decisions,"" SeaWorld spokesman Nick Gollattscheck told CNN on Sunday. Nelson: 'What they do at SeaWorld is not OK' The documentary -- which first aired on CNN in October -- tells the story of the killing in 2010 of experienced SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau by a 12,000-pound orca. The film raises questions about the safety and humaneness of keeping killer whales in captivity over the past 39 years. Moved by the documentary, fans started online petitions asking musicians to stay away. 'Blackfish' sparks debate over taking kids to animal parks . When the Barenaked Ladies nixed their plans last week to play at SeaWorld, they explained that it was a decision made after viewing ""Blackfish."" ""This is a complicated issue, and we don't claim to understand all of it, but we don't feel comfortable proceeding with the gig at this time,"" the band said in a Facebook post. When SeaWorld's Gollattscheck confirmed Nelson's decision not to sing at SeaWorld, he cited ""scheduling conflicts,"" but Nelson said it was because of the documentary and petition. ""I don't agree with the way they treat their animals,"" Nelson told CNN's Brooke Baldwin. ""It wasn't that hard a deal for me."" SeaWorld said it would like the musical artists to learn for themselves about SeaWorld. ""The bands and artists have a standing invitation to visit any of our parks to see firsthand or to speak to any of our animal experts to learn for themselves how we care for animals and how little truth there is to the allegations made by animal extremist groups opposed to the zoological display of marine mammals,"" Gollattscheck said. SeaWorld says the documentary ignores the park's conservation efforts and research. ""'Blackfish' focuses on a handful of incidents over our long history at the exclusion of everything else,"" wrote Michael Scarpuzzi, vice president for zoological operations at San Diego SeaWorld, in an op-ed on CNN.com. ""Not a single interview with a guest who was inspired and enriched by their experience with killer whales at SeaWorld. Not one visitor who left SeaWorld more aware of the need to preserve the world around them.

REO Speedwagon announced its cancellation on Friday. A promoter could put together a whale of a concert series with the acts that have canceled SeaWorld shows in the past several weeks, including Trisha Yearwood, Willie Nelson, Cheap Trick, Heart and Barenaked Ladies. The acts bailed on the Orlando theme park's concert series amid pressure from fans who started online petitions and took to social media. Only Justin Moore and Scotty McCreery remain from the original list of acts on the event calendar. Their representatives have not responded to CNN's repeated requests for comment. The fans became upset after watching the documentary ""Blackfish,"" which first aired on CNN in October. The film tells the story of the killing in 2010 of a SeaWorld trainer by an orca.

"(CNN) -- We've all wondered what it's like to die. Now there's a game that claims it can fulfill our curiosity, without actually killing us. ""Samadhi -- 4D Experience of Death,"" is a morbid ""escape room"" game that uses dramatic special effects to bring players close to what its creators imagine is an experience of death. When it opens in Shanghai in September 2014, it will invite participants to compete in a series of challenges to avoid ""dying."" Losers get cremated -- or are at least made to lie on a conveyor belt that transports them through a fake funeral home incinerator to simulate death rites. The faux cremator will use hot air and light projections to create what the organizers call ""an authentic experience of burning."" After ""cremation,"" participants are transferred to a soft, round, womb-like capsule, signifying their ""rebirth."" And the winner? ""He'll also have to die of course,"" says the game's fatalistic co-founder Ding Rui. As in life, he explains, ""everyone will die eventually, no matter what they've survived."" Life and death . Ding and his partner Huang Wei-ping went to great lengths researching their game, investigating the cremation process that typically awaits 50% of Chinese people after death. The pair visited a real crematorium and asked to be sent through the furnace with the flames turned off. ""Ding went in the crematory first and it was stressful for me to observe from the outside,"" says Huang. ""The controller of the crematory was also very nervous; he usually just focuses on sending bodies in, but not on bringing them back out."" When it came to Huang's turn, he found it unbearable. ""It was getting really hot. I couldn't breathe and I thought my life was over,"" he said. The pair say realism is essential to provoke participants into thinking about life and death. They'll operate the game while also running Hand in Hand, an organization that specializes in providing hospice support to dying patients in an oncology hospital. Soul searching . Huang says his interest in death emerged during a period of soul searching after a lucrative but spiritually unrewarding career as a trader. ""China made me rich, but it didn't teach me how to live a rich life. I was lost,"" he says. He went on to study psychology and volunteered to help in the aftermath of a 2008 earthquake in China's western Sichuan province, launching Hand in Hand shortly after. ""It opened a new door for me -- I went there to help but I was also saved."" Ding, meanwhile, had undertaken his own search for a meaning to life by organizing seminars with experts on the subject. ""I invited 'life masters' from different religions and other fields to come and talk about what life is,"" he says. ""I did that for two years before realizing that, instead of sitting here and listening passively, I could also do something."" That was when the two hooked up to create the ""4D Experience of Death."" Morbid curiosity . The pair were initially unsure of the appetite for their morbid concept, even though similar ventures have already opened in South Korea and Taiwan. Voluntary work in a hospice showed them that few people wanted to confront the idea of death, even when it was at hand. ""The saddest part of the job wasn't seeing the patients passing away but how the families refused to face death -- the final days with their loved ones consisted of kind but shallow lies,"" says Ding. ""We lack understanding of death and the fear can become so overwhelming."" To sound out the idea, Huang and Ding first started a fundraising campaign on jue.so, the Chinese version of Kickstarter. ""We received more than RMB 410,000 ($67,000) in three months, surpassing our target,"" says Huang. ""It turns out many people in China are curious about death."" Ding says they hope the experience will promote ""life education"" -- prompting people to ask questions about what they are doing with their lives and guiding them to face death in a personal way. ""There aren't any model answers in life and death education, unlike those courses that teach you to be rich and successful,"" says Huang. ""It is more important for people to experience it personally."" ""I was in a car crash once and the only thought in my mind then was 'why didn't I buy insurance?'"" says Huang. ""It wasn't what I had imagined for the final moments of my life. That romantic idea of having a flashback of one's entire life in the last moments before death -- that did not happen."" Samadhi -- 4D Experience of Death will be completed at the end of August and is scheduled to open in September. Sessions will be conducted in Chinese. Tickets RMB249 ($40). 101-104, Building 2, Gongyi Xintiandi, 105 West PuYu Road, Huangpu District, Shanghai .","""Samadhi -- 4D Experience of Death"" uses special effects to recreate an imagined experience of death .

"(CNN) -- With less than two weeks to go until Scotland's referendum, polls suggest an increase in those favoring independence from the United Kingdom, with one survey for the first time putting the ""yes"" vote ahead. On September 18, voters in Scotland will be presented with a simple yes/no question: Should Scotland be an independent country? A ""yes"" vote would mean Scotland splits from the rest of the United Kingdom -- that is, England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Activists on both sides are stepping up their efforts as the historic referendum approaches. A YouGov poll conducted for The Sunday Times and released on Sunday showed the ""yes"" vote at 51% and ""no"" at 49%. The poll of 1084 voters excluded undecided voters and YouGov said the numbers represented ""a statistical dead heat."" YouGov President Peter Kellner said a 2-point gap was too small to predict the outcome of the referendum but demonstrated that support for the ""Better Together"" campaign had fallen ""at an astonishing rate."" Four weeks ago YouGov put ""no"" at 58% and ""yes"" at 42%, Kellner said. ""The Yes campaign has not just invaded No territory; it has launched a blitzkrieg,"" he said. Kellner said voters from the Conservative party had continued to oppose independence but that all other voters had moved closer toward a breakaway Scotland. Meantime a Panelbase poll commissioned by Yes Scotland and also released Sunday suggested that 48% of voters supported independence -- excluding undecideds -- while 52% wanted to remain united. A ""poll of polls"" compiled by ScotCen put the ""yes"" vote for independence at 47% and the ""no"" vote at 53%. The company, which describes itself as an independent social research center, said those results were based on three polls from YouGov, two from Panelbase and one from Survation. It also suggested that the ""yes"" vote was gaining momentum, while the ""no"" vote was losing it. Negative campaign? The Scottish government, led by the Scottish National Party, says this is a ""once in a generation opportunity"" for Scotland's people to take control of the decisions that affect them most. A ""yes"" vote means that ""Scotland's future will be in Scotland's hands,"" it says, and that life will be better and fairer for its people. Scotland's first minister and SNP leader Alex Salmond has been a vocal proponent of independence. British Prime Minister David Cameron wants Scotland to remain part of an undivided United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. He says that it is a decision solely for the Scottish people -- but that remaining part of the United Kingdom will give them security and strength. ""There will be no going back,"" he warns. YouGov said voters felt that the Better Together campaign had been negative, while Salmond was ""offering an optimistic future."" ""It may be that some voters are finding the prospect of voting for positive and well-presented vision of their country's future as more attractive than the negative mood coming from the No camp,"" ScotCen commented. Pound sinks . The British pound sank on Monday, with CNNMoney reporting that it reflected uncertainty over the outcome of the Scottish referendum and an increased risk of a ""messy divorce."" Salmond has said he wants Scotland to continue to use the pound in a currency union with the rest of the United Kingdom. But the three main parties in Parliament -- David Cameron's Conservatives, their coalition partners the Liberal Democrats, and Labour -- have all said that won't be an option. The referendum could end Scotland's 300-year union with England and Wales as Great Britain and see it launch into the world as an independent nation of some 5.3 million people. The Scottish government anticipates it would become formally independent in March 2016, ahead of elections in May of that year. Scotland has long had a testy relationship with its more populous neighbor. The Act of Union in 1707 joined the kingdom of Scotland with England and Wales, but many Scots were unhappy at being yoked to their longtime rival south of the border. Since 1999, Scotland has had devolved government, meaning many, but not all, decisions are made at the Scottish Parliament in Holyrood, Edinburgh. In May 2011 the nationalist SNP, which had campaigned on a promise to hold an independence referendum, surprised many by winning an outright majority in the Scottish Parliament. In October 2012, the UK and Scottish governments agreed that the referendum would be held, and the question to be put to voters was agreed on early last year.

"(CNN) -- The family of Marlise Munoz has long said the pregnant Texas woman was brain dead, but now it has the medical records to confirm it, lawyers said Friday. ""We have recently received Marlise Munoz's medical records, and can now confirm that Mrs. Munoz is clinically brain dead, and therefore deceased under Texas law,"" attorneys Jessica Janicek and Heather King said in an e-mail. Meanwhile, the judge in the case has recused herself from ""all remaining proceedings"" and asked that another judge be assigned, according to the order for recusal. No reason for the recusal is cited, and Melody McDonald, a spokeswoman for the Tarrant County District Attorney's Office, said the office learned late Wednesday afternoon that the judge had stepped down. The case was transferred to the 96th District Court in the county, according to a court order signed Friday. ""I do not have any other details, and we will have no further comment at this time,"" she said. Munoz's husband, Erick, asked a court Tuesday to force a hospital to take her off a respirator, ventilator and other machines, saying her wishes shouldn't be disregarded just because she is pregnant. Erick Munoz filed an emergency motion as well as a complaint against John Peter Smith Hospital, both with the same goal: to have the hospital disconnect the machines so that her family can take her body and give her a proper burial. ""Marlise Munoz is legally dead, and to further conduct surgical procedures on a deceased body is nothing short of outrageous,"" her husband says in the motion. Erick Munoz -- like his wife, a paramedic by training -- said previously that doctors told him his wife ""had lost all activity in her brain stem,"" and an accompanying chart stated that she was ""brain dead,"" according to his lawsuit. The hospital referred requests for comment to the Tarrant County District Attorney's Office, which said it will defend the medical facility against the lawsuit. It is legal counsel for John Peter Smith Hospital ""in a number of civil areas."" In a brief court document filed Friday, the civil defendant said simply, ""Tarrant County Hospital District d/b/a JPS Health Network generally denies, each and every, all and singular, the allegations contained in Plaintiff's Original Petition and demands strict proof of the same."" At this time, no hearing has been scheduled in the case. Hospital spokesman J.R. Labbe said last month that doctors were simply trying to obey a Texas law that says ""you cannot withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatment for a pregnant patient."" Munoz's husband responded by saying that ""Marlise cannot possibly be a pregnant patient -- Marlise is dead."" Furthermore, he argued that her wishes -- relayed, he said, in conversations but not in writing that she not be on ""life-sustaining"" measures when she is brain dead -- shouldn't be treated differently from a man or other woman simply because of her pregnancy. Mother of pregnant woman on life support: Change the law . Last month, Erick Munoz discussed with CNN affiliate WFAA his wife's wishes and how their shared occupation had helped shape her views. ""We'd seen things out in the field. We both knew that we didn't want to be on life support,"" he said. ""We reached a point where you wish your wife's body would just stop."" Lynne Machado, Marlise Munoz's mother, said Tuesday the family is not talking about the case but said she and her husband, Ernest, agree with Erick Munoz that their daughter would want to be removed from the machines. 'Against the expressed will' of family . As the lawsuit details, the story began at 2 a.m. on November 26, when Erick found his wife unconscious on the kitchen floor. At the time, she was 14 weeks' pregnant with the couple's second child. Soon after that, she was taken to John Peter Smith Hospital, where Erick Munoz says he was told that his wife ""was for all purposes brain dead."" The family also says the fetus may have been deprived of oxygen. In the lawsuit, he says subsequent measures taken at the hospital -- and, in turn, the state law used to justify them -- amount ""to nothing more than the cruel and obscene mutilation of a deceased body against the expressed will of the deceased and her family."" ""Marlise Munoz's death is a horrible and tragic circumstance, but by no means should (the hospital) be entitled to continue cutting into her deceased body in front of her husband and family under the guise of 'life-sustaining' treatment,"" the lawsuit says. Dr. Jeffrey Ecker, director of obstetrical clinical research and quality assurance at Massachusetts General Hospital, works on complicated pregnancies and prenatal diagnosis. He says nothing scientifically in Marlise Munoz's pregnancy is black and white. ""A lot depends, first of all, on how long the patient here was deprived of oxygen, or otherwise compromised. We can certainly use tools like ultrasound and MRI to sometimes see where there has been injury as a result of low blood pressure or low oxygen. But just seeing that things look well isn't the same as saying that things will be well,"" he told CNN. ""Those things can't perfectly predict health and outcome. And there are certainly occasions where as we look as best as we can tell, a fetus seems to be developing appropriately and meeting all its milestones, and yet after birth, after delivery, there is evidence of profound compromise,"" Ecker said. Tom Mayo, a Southern Methodist University law professor who helped write the applicable Texas law, said he believes the hospital is misinterpreting it. ""She's not a patient anymore,"" he said. ""And so I don't see how we can use a provision of the law that talks about treating or not treating a patient in a case where we really don't have a patient."" The Texas law states that a ""person may not withdraw or withhold life-sustaining treatment under this subchapter from a pregnant patient."" Mayo said, ""The provision they seem to be relying on is called the pregnancy exclusion. More than 30 states have this pregnancy exclusion in their law. ... If they're relying on that provision, I think Texas law in that respect does not compel the provision of life-sustaining treatment.""

"(CNN) -- The search continues for a missing Navy pilot in the western Pacific Ocean after two U.S. fighter jets collided on Thursday while operating at sea, a Navy official told CNN on Friday.

"(CNN) -- When a slow-motion massacre has unfolded over the course of 15 months, it's easy to lose the world's attention. But even the most jaded gasped in horror as news emerged of the latest carnage inflicted on the Syrian people. The images from the town of Houla defied belief. Forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad went on a systematic killing spree, murdering at least 108 people. Most shockingly, the killers targeted women and children. A U.N. representative said the victims included 49 children who were younger than 10. The al-Assad regime denied it carried out the atrocities, but U.N. officials said they saw clear evidence that the Syrian government was involved in the attacks. Why would a regime, even a brutal dictatorship, send its thugs to kill women and children, even babies? Does it make any sense, even by the twisted logic of armed conflict and tyranny? Syria says regime not to blame for massacre; Rice says 'another blatant lie' In a most perverse, sickening way, it makes perfect sense. And for the logic underlying this most inhuman tactic, one need only look at what has transpired in recent months and years as uprisings have sprung throughout the region, from Iran to Tunisia. Now that Tehran has -- perhaps accidentally -- revealed that it has sent some of its forces to help al-Assad, the strategy has become even easier to understand. The Syrian dictator is trying to restore a balance of fear, perhaps the most powerful weapon in the hands of tyrants throughout history. Killing children is supposed to intimidate the opposition. A couple of days after the Houla massacre, a top commander of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards, Ismail Ghani, told a reporter from Iran's Isna news that ""before our presence in Syria, too many people were killed by the opposition but with the physical and nonphysical presence of the Islamic republic, big massacres in Syria were prevented."" Isna quickly deleted the interview, but the news was out. Ghani is the deputy commander of the Quds Force, whose mission is ""extraterritorial operations,"" or revolution beyond Iran's borders. Western diplomats are pushing for a negotiated settlement, but Syria, Iran's only ally in the Arab world, is following what looks very much like an Iranian script, using blunt force to put down anti-government protests. That's what Iran did in 2009 when the so-called Green Revolution arose after the disputed presidential elections. Tehran used its paramilitary Basij militias to brutally suppress the protests. But that was before the Arab uprisings showed people throughout the Middle East that sometimes revolutions do succeed. When al-Assad scans the horizon, he sees what happened to other Arab dictators. The presidents of Egypt, Tunisia and Yemen have lost power. The example of Moammar Gadhafi does not seem to apply to him so far, since opinion in the West until now has leaned against direct military intervention . A reign of terror helped al-Assad's father, the feared Hafez Assad, keep power for three decades, and then hand the country to his son as if it amounted to private property to be inherited by the next generation. When the elder Assad faced an uprising in 1982, he ordered his loyal army to pulverize the opposition. The entire town of Hama was razed to the ground. Estimates of the dead range from 10,000 to 30,000 killed by Assad's troops. That put a quick end to the revolt. The younger al-Assad is trying to do his father proud. But, despite the mounting death toll, he has lost the weapon of fear. Already 13,000 people are said to have died in the Syrian uprising. Despite that, the protesters are not staying home. Al-Assad, incidentally, denies any responsibility for the Houla massacre. He blames ""terrorists,"" but nobody's buying his denials. Witnesses say, and the evidence confirms, that government troops started firing tank shells and mortars at protesters during the Friday demonstration that has become a ritual of the anti-dictatorship movement. But the worst was yet to come. Houla is a Sunni Muslim town, a stronghold of the anti-Assad movement. It is also home to a military college, from where the tank and mortar fire came. U.N. observers found evidence of tank shells, which are not part of the opposition's arsenal. Before long, paramilitary forces known as the Shabiha -- the Syrian version of Iran's Basij -- joined the fight, assaulting demonstrators with gunfire and knives. By nightfall, the attacks became the worst of nightmares. The Shabiha, gangs of thugs and criminals, mostly belong to the president's Alawite sect. According to the U.N., about 20 people were killed by artillery fire. Most of the others were murdered execution-style in their homes. In some cases, entire families were killed. In the face of the heart wrenching death toll, the U.S., the West and the rest of the world are feeling renewed pressure to take action. The Syrian opposition and some in the region have called for intervention, but few are inclined to step in. Some observers, including Zbigniew Brzezinski, a former national security adviser, say the U.S. should step back, arguing that as tragic as the situation is, there are many other problems of greater importance. But the probable presence of Iran in Syria highlights just how important this battle is, and not just for the Syrian people. The U.S. and the rest of the world should care about Syria not only for humanitarian reasons, but because the entire Middle East is now in play. If al-Assad survives, it will mark a victory for anti-American, anti-democratic forces in the Middle East. It will tilt the balance of power in the region in favor of dictatorship, in favor of the use of force and fear as the instrument of power and in favor of a regime in Tehran whose aim is to export its brand of retrograde, anti-American, anti-women, anti-gay, freedom-suppressing revolution. If al-Assad falls, it will mark a major defeat for Iran, one that will alter the region in ways that, while not certain to follow American wishes in every respect, has the potential to eventually improve stability. This is the Syrian people's fight, and there's no need now to put American ""boots on the ground."" But the U.S. government has a long menu of options to help bring about the end of the despicable al-Assad regime. No choice is without risk, and no route is assured of success, but it is clear that those seeking to overthrow the al-Assad regime should receive more active help from the West. The riskiest course of action is to stay on the sidelines and let Bashar al-Assad murder his people while we look the other way. The killing of children by a regime determined to intimidate the opposition made that point abundantly clear. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Frida Ghitis: The Houla massacre caused much of the world to gasp .

"(CNN) -- The chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee used domestic violence analogies while attacking Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin on Wednesday. At an event on women's issues in Milwaukee, Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz blasted Walker for his policies, saying he ""has given women the back of his hand."" ""I know that is stark. I know that is direct,"" she continued. ""I know that is reality."" She added that: ""What Republican tea party extremists like Scott Walker are doing is they are grabbing us by the hair and pulling us back. It is not going to happen on our watch."" Her remarks were first reported by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Lily Adams, a spokeswoman for the congresswoman, did not apologize for the comments but said later in a statement to CNN that ""domestic violence is an incredibly serious issue and the Congresswoman was by no means belittling the very real pain survivors experience."" ""That's why Democrats have consistently supported the Violence Against Women Act and won't take a lesson from the party that blocked and opposed its reauthorization,"" she continued. ""The fact of the matter is that Scott Walker's policies have been bad for Wisconsin's women."" The governor is fighting off a challenge from Democrat Mary Burke in a tight gubernatorial race this fall. Republican Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch said in a statement that she is ""shocked"" that Schultz ""would use such outrageous language to try and score political points."" ""I think the remarks were absolutely hideous and the motive behind them was despicable,"" she said. Stephanie Wilson, press secretary for Burke, said Schultz's comments are ""not the type of language that Mary Burke would use, or has used, to point out the clear differences in this contest. For the last 11 months of this campaign, and in the final nine weeks left to go, Mary is committed to pointing out those clear differences. There is plenty that she and Gov. Walker disagree on, but those disagreements can and should be pointed out respectfully."" CNN's Dana Bash and Steve Brusk contributed to this report.","DNC chairwoman said Gov.

"(CNN) -- A family is grieving and a Michigan community is in shock after a 9-year-old boy was stabbed to death at a playground in his neighborhood this week. The shock felt in Kentwood, just outside of Grand Rapids, is as much over the sudden and senseless loss of Michael Conner Verkerke as it is over the circumstances of his death: The person accused of stabbing him was a 12-year-old he had just met at the playground. Conner was playing with three other children Monday ""when one of the children, for an unknown reason, pulled out a knife and repeatedly stabbed one of the other children,"" a Kentwood Police Department statement said. Police say the attacker is 12-year-old Jamarion Lawhorn. A motive, if there is one, is unknown at this point, as the boys were not acquainted, according to Kent County Prosecutor Chris Becker. Lawhorn was charged Tuesday with murder. Though he'll be tried in a juvenile court, it will be as an adult, according to Becker, who added that his office has not yet decided whether the murder charges will be first or second degree. Charles Boekeloo, Lawhorn's court-appointed attorney, said he met his client for the first time at his arraignment Tuesday but had no further comment. Boekeloo entered a not guilty plea on the youth's behalf. Police said that after he was stabbed, Conner managed to run back home before he collapsed on the porch. An ambulance rushed him to a hospital, where he died Monday night. Lawhorn, meanwhile, ""left the playground then went to a nearby residence where he asked to use the phone,"" Kentwood Chief of Police Thomas Hillen said. ""I thought he was calling for his parents to come pick him up,"" homeowner Glen Stacy told CNN. He wasn't. ""He called 911,"" he said. Stacy described Lawhorn as ""calm and collected"" throughout, and that he told the 911 dispatcher, ""Hi, I just stabbed someone, please pick me up and come kill me, I want to end my life."" The boy then calmly handed back the phone with the operator still on the line, according to Stacy, and they waited for police to arrive. ""At no point did I feel threatened,"" he said. Stacy said that when the first officers arrived on the scene, they ran toward the playground, which was in the opposite direction. That prompted Lawhorn to raise his voice for the first time, according to Stacy. ""Hey! I'm over here!"" Stacy said he shouted. ""Let's do this. I'm ready,"" he said as he walked toward them with his hands on his head, Stacy said. A competency hearing will be held soon, according to police, but Becker has already predicted an outcome: ""My gut tells me they will go for an insanity plea,"" he said. One expert said that based on the circumstances and violent nature of the act, it would appear Lawhorn -- who turned 12 in March -- suffers from mental illness. ""The instrument in this case says something about his state of mind,"" said Dr. Charles Williams, a child psychotherapist at Drexel University in Philadelphia. ""It's easy to pick up a gun and shoot someone, but to stab someone repeatedly with a knife -- that's a very personal and very angry act from a psychological standpoint."" In Kentwood, a GoFundMe page was established Tuesday to pay for Conner's funeral. By Wednesday evening, 166 people donated more than $7,000 for the cause. Lawhorn is being held at the Kent County Detention Center. A preliminary hearing has been scheduled for August 13. Girl charged in Slenderman stabbing deemed incompetent .

"(CNN) -- The director of Iraq's largest hydroelectric dam shot down reports Monday that it had been seized by the radical Islamic State, saying Kurdish forces fended off an assault. Fighters with the Islamic State, formerly the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, were pushed back after gaining access to a housing compound for employees who work at the dam just north of Iraq's second largest city, Mosul, Abdul Khaliq al-Dabbagh, the director of the Mosul Dam, said. Conflicting reports about who was in control of the dam on the Tigris River began Sunday amid news of fierce fighting between Islamic State fighters and Kurdish forces, known as Peshmerga. A Kurdish commander told CNN on Sunday that ISIS had taken control of it, though employees remained at the dam. But al-Dabbagh said the Peshmerga held their positions until reinforcements arrived early Monday morning. ISIS -- known for killing dozens of people at a time and carrying out public executions, crucifixions and other acts -- has taken over large swaths of northern and western Iraq as it seeks to create an Islamic state that stretches from Syria into Iraq. The United Nations in Iraq warned that 200,000 civilians were trapped in dire circumstances after the Islamic State and associated armed groups ""seized control of nearly all of Sinjar and Tal Afar districts"" in the northern Ninevah province, including several small oil fields that border Iraq's Kurdish region. Most of the people who fled districts are minority Kurdish Yezidis, an ancient religious sect with ties to Islam, Christianity and Judaism. A large number have taken refuge in the Jabal Sinjar mountains, the United Nations said. Kurdish fighters battled ISIS in an attempt top retake Sinjar -- a small town inhabited by the Yezidi sect -- on Monday and have been engaged in house-to-house battles in some of the fiercest fighting since the fall of Mosul to the Islamic militant group in June, a Kurdish commander said. Both sides are using heavy weaponry, the source said. Fighting has also been reported in the border town of Rabia, with Syria-based Kurds joining the battle against Islamic State militants. Meanwhile, the head of the Kurdistan Regional Government, Massoud Barzani, told a group of Yezidi sect leaders that his government would liberate Sinjar, according to a report on the government's website. Barzani said the Kurds had been fighting without any help from the Iraqi government or the international community. The State Department said Sunday that it was ""actively monitoring the situation"" in Sinjar and Tal Afar, and said that the United States is supporting both Iraqi security forces and Peshmerga forces in the fight against the Islamic State. ""The assault over the past 48 hours on territories along the border of the Iraqi Kurdistan Region and focusing on towns and villages populated by vulnerable minorities, demonstrates once again that this terrorist organization is a dire threat to all Iraqis, the entire region and the international community,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Innovative music producer Phil Ramone, whose work with the major artists of the modern era won him 14 Grammys and prompted the nickname ""Pope of Pop,"" died Saturday morning in a New York hospital, his son, Matt, told CNN. The family did not immediately provide a cause of death. Ramone was 79, according to Billboard. ""What a great man, what a kind spirit, such an incredible producer,"" said Stevie Wonder, calling Ramone ""the star of stars behind the stars."" ""Truly a tragic loss for us on earth but what a wonderful blessing for heaven."" Ramone's collaboration credits are a Who's Who of the music industry: Burt Bacharach, Bono, Ray Charles, Bob Dylan, Aretha Franklin, Quincy Jones, Madonna, Paul McCartney, Paul Simon and Frank Sinatra, to name a few. Many of them responded to Saturday's news with sadness and praise. ""This is so shocking. I just performed for his tribute in December,"" Franklin said in a statement. ""Truly one of the great names in music has gone on, but the melodies will remain."" Said Billy Joel: ""I always thought of Phil Ramone as the most talented guy in my band. ... The music world lost a giant today."" Barbra Streisand recalled working with Ramone in 1967 when she did a free concert in New York's Central Park and noticed ""his brilliance at capturing sound,"" she said. They worked on the film ""A Star is Born"" and later the soundtrack to ""Yentl."" ""Phil had impeccable musical taste, great ears and the most gentle way of bringing out the best in all the artists he worked with,"" Streisand said. ""The monumental recordings he produced will endure for all time."" From prodigy to producer . A violin prodigy, Ramone began studying music at 3. At 10, he performed for Queen Elizabeth II. As he got older, though, his focus turned to helping others make the best music possible. He opened his own studio, New York's A&R Recordings, and developed a friendship with Atlantic Records' renowned engineer and producer, Tom Dowd. ""He was not only a great friend, but a mentor,"" Ramone said in 2005. ""... I owe him a tremendous amount. He shaped the way I worked."" There's no question that Ramone made his own mark -- across most all types of music, embracing the old and the new. A board member of the Grammy Museum at the time of his death, he worked across all genres of music and served as chair of the board of trustees of The Recording Academy. Ramone's collaboration with Ray Charles, Billy Joel and Paul Simon won a total of three album of the year awards, and Ramone won producer of the year (non-classical) in 1980, The Recording Academy said. But he never confined himself to one genre. Take, for instance, his work in Broadway and off-Broadway productions, including ""Chicago"" and ""The Wiz."" Then there are the songs and entire soundtracks he produced for films such as ""Flashdance,"" ""Ghostbusters"" and ""Midnight Cowboy."" And in television, he produced and supervised music for television specials such as the Oscars, Elton John at Radio City Music Hall, ""The Jim Henson Hour"" and ""The Muppets at Walt Disney World."" 'A musical genius and the most lovable person' Ask Ramone, though, and he'd tell you the reason he had so much success was because of the talent around him, which he worked hard to best showcase. ""It's all about the raw material,"" he told CNN in 2005 from his home in Westchester County, New York. ""You have to be prepared for anything that comes."" Still, while he might have deflected praise, there was no stopping it Saturday night. Elton John called Ramone ""a friend, a musical genius and the most lovable person."" James Taylor, too, praised both the producer -- calling him ""a pioneer"" -- and the person. ""He lit up any room he entered,"" Taylor said. Neil Sedaka said he was 16 years old when Ramone added the rhythm section to his demos, which became his first two records, ""Laura Lee"" and ""Snowtime."" ""He knew how to get the most out of the artists he worked with,"" Sedaka said. ""With his passing the record business lost one of the all time greats."" Quincy Jones knew Ramone, as a friend and collaborator, for more than 50 years. If Ramone wasn't by his side in the studio, ""It would seem like one ingredient was missing,"" said Jones, a legendary producer in his own right. ""Today we lost one of the true musicians, innovators and geniuses of the record industry,"" Jones said. ""His immense talents were only surpassed by the gigantic size of his heart."" People we lost in 2013: The lives they lived . CNN's Denise Quan and Todd Leopold contributed to this report.","Phil Ramone died Saturday at a New York hospital, his son says .

"(CNN) -- Your Internet won't be any slower than usual on Wednesday, but it might look like it is. Top sites on the Internet, including Netflix and Reddit, will be displaying a constant ""loading"" symbol -- the so-called ""loading pinwheel"" or, alternately, the Spinning Wheel of Death. It's part of a protest called ""Internet Slowdown Day,"" a push against the U.S. government's support for so-called Internet fast lanes. The Federal Communications Commission in May proposed allowing broadband providers to charge companies like Amazon and Netflix for prioritized access to consumers. The proposal is now open for public comment and could be changed before a final vote to implement it. As part of the Internet Slowdown Day protest, the websites will also include a prompt to contact your lawmakers about the FCC proposal. ""It's always hard to explain complicated topics to a lot of people, and the FCC made it harder by trying to fool the public into thinking their proposal was real net neutrality, when it was actually what the cable and phone lobbyists always asked for,"" said organizer David Segal, executive director of civil liberties group Demand Progress and a former Rhode Island state representative. Net neutrality refers to the principle that high-speed Internet providers should treat all types of Web content equally, which led to a set of rules the FCC approved in 2010, designed to keep the companies that hold the keys to the Web from playing favorites. 'Pay to play' on the Web? Net neutrality explained . Sites including Netflix, Reddit, Vimeo, Etsy, Upworthy and Digg plan to take part in this week's demonstration, which will last from midnight Wednesday to midnight Thursday. Broadband Internet providers, many of them cable companies, argue that as businesses providing a service, they have a right to charge websites. Netflix accounts for around a third of data consumption online during peak hours, and Internet providers say the company should therefore help foot the bill for delivery. But those fees would be easier to absorb for the Web's biggest, and richest, sites, activists say. Smaller, less profitable sites would have a tough time competing. Segal said altering the FCC plan is an uphill battle, but he's optimistic. ""We can never ever underestimate the power of cable and phone companies in D.C., but we definitely have a shot of winning,"" he said. ""We have the momentum and are building impressive support in the public, industry, and policymakers.""","Websites will participate in Internet Slowdown Day on Wednesday .

"Pittstown, New Jersey (CNN) -- When Chip Paillex started a garden with his 4-year-old daughter in 2002, he never imagined it would change the lives of thousands of people. That first year, they grew much more produce than their family could eat. Paillex did not want the excess going to waste, so he started giving it to friends and co-workers. Then he learned about others who needed it more. ""We saw a three-line article in the paper,"" Paillex remembers. ""It said, 'If you ever have extra produce, bring it down to the food pantry. Grow a row for the hungry.'"" Paillex and his daughter donated 120 pounds of produce that year. He knew the experience would provide some good lessons for her. But it opened his eyes, too. ""At first, I thought it was just that people were hungry,"" Paillex said. ""But then I realized that people were hungry for fresh fruits and vegetables."" Since then, Paillex has been helping to provide fresh produce for more than just his local pantry. His nonprofit, America's Grow-a-Row, now grows and harvests fruits and vegetables for people in need all over the state. ""New Jersey, the Garden State, is known for its produce,"" said Paillex, 47. ""(But) there's tons of produce throughout this state that, unfortunately, doesn't make its way to a lot of the people that are in need here."" Spreading the wealth . Paillex started the organization from his small plot, with help from family and close friends. Every weekday for almost four years, he worked in the garden from 5 a.m. to 8 a.m. before heading off to his full-time job. Then he gardened again until nightfall. In 2007, he left his corporate job to dedicate himself full time to the nonprofit. It has grown to 49 acres of farmland and almost 4,000 volunteers. To help distribute the hundreds of thousands of pounds of produce it grows each year, the group partnered with the Community FoodBank of New Jersey. They also collect excess from other farms and supermarkets in the area. The produce is donated to food banks all over the state. ""Our goal is to get everybody in the state -- whether it be a child or an adult -- to be able to eat healthy,"" Paillex said. ""It's not something that should be a luxury."" When Paillex learned about food deserts -- areas in the country that do not have access to healthy, affordable food -- he and his group set up farm markets to provide free fresh produce to residents of these areas. From July to November, the group holds its free farm markets in five cities in New Jersey, including Camden and Newark. Residents also receive healthy recipes for preparing the produce. The group's free farm markets have been a lifesaver for Imogene Thompson. Living on a fixed income, the 64-year-old had trouble getting the fresh food necessary for her health. ""I have diabetes and high blood pressure. Eating healthy is very important to me,"" she said. ""Some things that I need for my diet, a lot of times I can't afford, especially produce."" Thompson now goes to the group's farm markets in Jersey City, and things have turned around for her. ""I have lost some weight. My sugar is better controlled, and the vegetables and food is delicious,"" Thompson said. ""Without Chip, nobody around here would be eating fresh fruits and vegetables like we do."" Little farmers . For Paillex and his group, the work is about more than just feeding people. The goal also is to educate people of all ages about where their food comes from and why it is important. Paillex said recipients also return to volunteer with the group. ""There's a sense of community that comes out of this program,"" he said. The group's summer youth program introduces children from New Jersey's inner city areas to farming and healthy eating. For many of these children, it is their first time on a farm. ""They immediately are struck by the fact that food grows out of the ground,"" Paillex said. ""For them to be able to actually pull it out of the ground and harvest it and then bring it home to their families, that's huge."" America's Grow-A-Row has donated almost 3 million pounds of fresh produce, which has reached roughly 140,000 people. Paillex plans to expand the program to other states. ""To be able to put fresh food on someone's plate who's hungry that night,"" Paillex said, ""there's no greater feeling and no greater reward."" Want to get involved?

"Washington (CNN) -- The Phoenix VA, where dozens of veterans died waiting for care and were placed on secret wait lists, was in total ""chaos"" with patients needing urgent care and often unable to get it, officials from the VA's Inspector General's Office testified at a Senate hearing Tuesday. What's more, these officials said some 3,526 patients at the Phoenix VA still ""may be at risk"" for receiving poor urologic care, according to an ongoing investigation by the IG's office. The problems of very long wait lists for veterans and serious scheduling issues go well beyond Phoenix and exist in many VA facilities, Inspector General Richard Griffin and members of his staff told the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee. Nearly 70 VA hospitals or clinics have ""knowingly and willingly"" altered or manipulated their wait lists and schedules to obscure problems, testified Dr. John D. Daigh Jr., assistant inspector general for health care inspections. Tuesday's testimony confirmed investigations, reported throughout the past year by CNN, that focused on delays and deaths across the VA system. In May, following reports of patients dying while waiting for care at the Phoenix VA, VA Secretary Eric Shinseki was forced to step down. Robert McDonald was appointed this summer to helm the agency. Despite increased oversight, hundreds of thousands of veterans may still remain on wait lists, according to Tuesday's testimony. 'I am committed to fixing this problem' The VA system might need as many as 28,000 doctors and other medical staff to help fix the problems and provide proper and timely care to veterans, said McDonald, who also testified. ""I am committed to fixing this problem and providing timely, high-quality care that veterans have earned and that they desire,"" McDonald said. ""That's how we regain veterans trust, and that's how we regain your trust and the trust of the American people."" Tuesday's hearing was prompted by an IG report released late last month, examining the situation in Phoenix and also across the VA system. That report found 28 veterans who suffered ""clinically significant delays in care associated with access to care or patient scheduling."" And of those 28 patients, six died. In addition the report found 17 other ""care deficiencies that were unrelated to access or scheduling,"" and of those 17 patients, 14 died. The IG report at the heart of the hearing described what Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent who is chairman of the Committee on Veterans Affairs, called ""inexcusable"" practices in Phoenix. The report reviewed the cases of more than 3,400 patients and found 28 instances of clinically significant delays in care associated with access or scheduling. Of the 28, six were deceased. An additional 17 cases identified in the report were not related to access issues. A follow-up report specifically focusing on the hospital system's urology department is underway. 'Disappointment, frustration and loss of faith' ""This report cannot capture the personal disappointment, frustration and loss of faith individual veterans and their family members had in the health care system that often could not respond to their mental and physical health needs in a timely manner,"" said Griffin. ""Immediate and substantive changes are needed."" ""I said at the time of my confirmation hearing that I will put veterans at the center of everything we do at VA,"" said McDonald. ""So let me begin by offering my personal apologies to all veterans who experienced unacceptable delays in receiving care. It's clear that we failed in that respect."" Griffin estimated that only one-fourth of 93 facilities were not engaging in scheduling manipulation. ""The bad news is that on the other three-fourths, we're pretty confident that it was knowingly and willingly happening,"" Griffin said. ""And we're pursuing those."" The effects of the widespread wait list manipulation is still being felt. Navy veteran loses his nose waiting for treatment . McDonald said that as of August 15, the Veterans Health Administration had contacted more than 294,000 veterans and had decreased the electronic wait list nationwide by 57%. McDonald also noted in his testimony that lack of staff was a crucial problem. Internal data indicated a need for 28,000 new staff members, including doctors and other clinicians. A new recruiting push by the VA was underway, McDonald said. ""We are trying to demonstrate to young people studying in the medical profession that VA's where they want to work,"" McDonald said. Question: Is the report independent? Griffin faced questions about the independence of the report. Sen. Dean Heller, R-New Hampshire, implored Griffin about the report's findings and whether the VA had edited it. His questioning hinged on a line in the report that indicated that the delays in care could not be conclusively linked to the deaths. Heller asked whether that line was included in the draft of the report submitted for review to the VA. ""It was reported that a line was inserted,"" Heller said. ""And if you're the VA, this is the line you want inserted in that report."" ""There are many versions of a draft report,"" Griffin replied. ""The majority of the changes in our draft report came about as result of further deliberations by the senior staff of the Inspector General's Office. No one in VA dictated that sentence go in that report."" Scathing report slams veterans' care but says no definite link to deaths . Griffin explained that he hoped to have the results of the 93 additional site reviews completed by the end of the year. McDonald testified to numerous efforts underway across the VA system to decrease wait times and provide veterans faster, needed medical care. He told the senators there is a new push to have many changes made before Veterans Day in November.","Officials from the Inspector General's Office testify at a Senate hearing .

"Washington (CNN) -- Bernie Sanders wants you to know he's talking about the issues that Hillary Clinton is not. At the end of a winding answer to a question about how he differs from Hillary Clinton, the U.S. senator challenged the former secretary of state. ""If we do not get our act together to come up with public policy which expands the middle class, if we don't overturn Citizens United, if we don't move to public funding of elections, we are going to live in an oligarchic form of society,"" Sanders said. ""Now is Hillary Clinton going to say that?"" It was a candid moment and the closest the senator -- who is most known for being an independent who regularly targets Wall Street and money in politics -- came to a direct knock on Clinton's possible run at the presidency during an interview with CNN before his upcoming trip to Iowa. His comment about Citizens United referred to a 2010 U.S. Supreme Court decision that opened the floodgates for outside money in politics and ballooned the amount spent on campaigns. It was also something that the Vermont senator quickly realized didn't match his statement, ""I am not here to attack Hillary."" ""I know Hillary, I respect Hillary Clinton,"" Sanders said. ""I knew her when she was first lady, I certainly knew her as a colleague in the Senate. ""I don't know if Secretary Clinton is running for president and I have no idea what she is going to be campaigning on. But I do know what I believe and what I will be speaking about."" Sanders, who caucuses with Democrats, is trying to thread a needle. He is little known outside liberal circles, yet the two-term senator is openly considering a run at the presidency in 2016. He is making the trip to Iowa this weekend and will speak in New Hampshire in a few weeks. He is floating the idea of a run with journalists and political operatives and saying things like,""If I choose to run."" Yet Sanders doesn't want to openly talk about Clinton and says he would rather focus on his views on the ""political,"" ""economic"" and ""media"" establishments. He is attacking Clinton, something most Democrats aren't doing, but trying to say he isn't. Hillary Clinton to court Democratic women in September . Correct the Record, a pro-Clinton communications group, took issue with the idea that Clinton didn't address the issues Sanders had been addressing. ""Senator Sanders has a good point -- the American people always want a campaign that includes a spirited dialogue about the issues,"" said Adrienne Elrod, the group's communications director. ""But Hillary has spent her entire life turning talk into action, putting policies in place to make lives better for all Americans."" Coincidentally, Sanders' trip to Iowa this weekend comes at the same time Clinton will be making her first trip to the critical presidential caucus state in six years. Hillary Clinton to decide on 2016 run around end of year . Clinton, who is herself openly considering a run at the presidency, will be the headliner at the politically important Tom Harkin Steak Fry. Thousands of guests expect to listen to her speak, flip steaks and honor Harkin, the liberal senator who is retiring after 2014. Sanders, on the other hand, will not be at the steak fry. He will start the weekend with a speech at the Fighting Bob Fest, an annual meeting of progressive speakers in Wisconsin that honors Robert ""Fighting Bob"" La Follette, a longtime liberal senator from the Badger State. Following his speech, where aides expect him to articulate his liberal platform, Sanders will travel to Iowa for town hall-style events in Dubuque, Waterloo and Des Moines, respectively. For Sanders, who has done hundreds of town hall events in his home state, the Iowa events comes with pros and cons. Primarily, they allow the senator to get his name out there and gauge interest in him as a candidate. ""I want to find out what kind of support there is for a progressive agenda which takes to the needs of a collapsing middle class and the growing wealth and income inequality America,"" Sanders said. ""It is easy to give a good speech and get applause, it is not so easy to put together a grassroots movement of people who are prepared to fight for change."" But they will also offer a glimpse of his uphill climb. While Sanders speaks to small town halls, Clinton will likely be fawned over by thousands of supporters at the most political event of the year in Iowa. Sanders was clear to point out that he does know Harkin, the organizer of the steak fry, ""very well"" and was invited ""a couple of years ago to be the guest."" But Sanders sees a bigger positive for him in attending small events and offering a stark alternative to Clinton. ""I don't think anybody believes that anointment is a good idea, that anybody is quote unquote entitled to a nomination or any other position,"" Sanders said. ""I think what people in Iowa and through the country want to hear is a vigorous debate about the most important issues which impact their lives. It is not to say to somebody, 'Oh, thank you, you are going to be anointed as our candidate.'""","Sanders challenges Clinton to address issues he talks about in an interview with CNN .
""Now is Hillary Clinton going to say that?"" he asks after outlining part of his populist platform .

"(CNN) -- The Disney Channel's ""Girl Meets World"" will meet its eager audience in June. The cable network has announced that ""Girl Meets World,"" a spinoff of '90s comedy ""Boy Meets World,"" will have its official debut on June 27 following a four-hour marathon of ""Boy Meets World"" on June 15. ""Boy Meets World"" ran for seven seasons on ABC between 1993 and 2000, and starred Ben Savage and Danielle Fishel. The two actors played Cory Matthews and Topanga Lawrence, a pair of friends who later become love interests and eventually marry. The ""Girl Meets World"" spinoff has Fishel and Savage reprising their characters, except they're no longer the story's main focus. Instead, ""Girl Meets World"" follows the coming-of-age tale of Cory and Topanga's tween daughter, Riley (Rowan Blanchard). The couple also have a young son, Auggie, played by August Maturo. The new Disney series is expected to hit many of the same themes as ""Boy Meets World."" That show followed the mischievous adventures of Cory and his best friend, Shawn (Rider Strong), and ""Girl Meets World"" pairs Riley with a ""bold"" best friend of her own, Maya. And also like its predecessor, the central characters start off in middle school, where Cory Matthews works as the girls' history teacher. While the plot will focus on Riley and her friends, there will be no shortage of ""Boy Meets World"" characters in the spinoff. Rider Strong, William Daniels (Mr. Feeney), Lee Norris (Minkus) and the actors who played Cory's parents, William Russ and Betsy Randle, are all expected to appear. For fans who can't hold out until June, Disney's also offering the series premiere via its digital service, Watch Disney Channel, starting May 21 for verified subscribers. ""Girl Meets World"" will premiere June 27 at 9:45 p.m. ET/PT before moving to its regular time slot of 8:30 p.m. ET/PT on July 11.","The Disney Channel's ""Girl Meets World"" will premiere June 27 .

"(CNN) -- If this weekend's box office battle was a big-screen boxing match, it would have been the original ""Rocky"": grinning, glamorous Apollo Creed against little-known and less-regarded Rocky Balboa. No one expected that one to go the full 15 rounds, either. In this weekend's showdown, it was the established ""Gone Girl"" against newcomer fantasy action flick ""Dracula Untold."" ""Gone Girl"" held the title belt, but not by much: the adaptation of Gillian Flynn's best-seller earned roughly $26.8 million compared with ""Dracula Untold's"" $23.5 million. But ""Gone Girl"" seemed to have everything going for it, including big-name stars (led by Oscar winner Ben Affleck), critical acclaim and tremendous word of mouth. Estimated second-weekend ticket sales fell just 29%, compared with the 40% to 50% decline most box office champs suffer in their second week out. Unlike the champ, ""Untold"" seemed to have everything going against it. With the lead role held by Luke Evans, best known as the bad guy in last year's ""Fast & Furious 6,"" there was a lack of major stars. Then there was the consideration of competition: Horror movie ""Annabelle"" had opened the previous weekend, and unlike last year, most fright flicks are underperforming in 2014. And the reviews? Most critics put a stake through its heart, leaving ""Dracula Untold"" at a putrid 26% on RottenTomatoes.com. Yet when the dust settled, ""Dracula Untold"" was the weekend's top new movie. It's a fresh take on the Dracula legend: Evans plays Vlad as a heroic figure who's willing to do anything, including join the undead, to protect his family and his homeland. When you add in international ticket sales, the action-horror movie has already made back its $70 million budget. Newcomer ""Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day"" also had much going for it, making its debut with big stars (Steve Carell and Jennifer Garner) and a story based on a much-loved book (Judith Viorst's 1972 children's classic). While the live-action comedy knocked rival family film ""The Boxtrolls"" well down the chart, it also found itself sitting on the sidelines in third place. The weekend's other new movies, ""The Judge,"" starring Robert Downey Jr. and Robert Duvall, and ""Addicted,"" starring Sharon Leal and Boris Kodjoe, performed about as expected, debuting fifth and seventh, respectively. And after 2Â½ months, ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" finally fell out of the top 10. That said, people are still going to see the top-grossing movie of the year: It's up to $326 million domestic. Turns out we are all Groot. Weekend domestic box office estimates from Exhibitor Relations Co., with final numbers available Monday afternoon: . 1. ""Gone Girl"": $26.8 million ($78.3 million total) 2. ""Dracula Untold"": $23.5 million (debut) 3. ""Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day"": $19.1 million (debut) 4. ""Annabelle"": $16.4 million ($62.2 million total) 5. ""The Judge"": $13.3 million (debut)","""Dracula Untold"" was the weekend's top new movie .
But returning champ ""Gone Girl"" held the title belt .
Family comedy ""Alexander"" opened at No. 3 ."
"UNITED NATIONS (CNN) -- Russia and China vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution Friday that would have imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe's longtime president, Robert Mugabe, and 11 senior members of his government. Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe meets this week with Arthur Mutambara, an opposition leader. According to a draft of the resolution, the measure would have instituted a travel ban on Mugabe and others in his government, frozen many of their assets and imposed an international arms embargo on the regime. The measure received nine votes -- the minimum for it to pass. However, two of the five negative votes were from Russia and China, who as permanent members of the Security Council have veto power. One Security Council member abstained. The resolution was pushed by the United States after Mugabe ignored the Security Council's appeal to postpone the June 27 presidential runoff election. The vote initially was intended to be a runoff between Mugabe and opposition candidate Morgan Tsvangirai. But Tsvangirai withdrew days before, saying Mugabe's supporters had orchestrated a campaign of beatings, intimidation and murders against his supporters. With their votes, ambassadors for China and Russia said they wanted to give the rival political parties a chance to resolve the election matter on their own terms without undue interference from the Security Council. Representatives from Mugabe's party, the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF), have been meeting in Pretoria, South Africa, with the opposition Movement for Democratic Change this week. Tsvangirai said Wednesday the talks, which are being mediated by South African President Thabo Mbeki, are focusing on ""how to move forward."" Chinese Ambassador Wang Guangya said his nation believes the international community should allow the talks in South Africa on the Zimbabwe situation a chance to progress before imposing sanctions. Wang said the adoption of the resolution would ""unavoidably interfere with the negotiation process and lead to the further deterioration of the situation."" ""Many countries, including China, repeatedly called upon the Security Council to respect the position of the African countries on this question and give more time,"" Wang said. ""China has always maintained the best approach to solve a problem is negotiation and dialogue,"" Wang said. ""To use or threaten to use sanctions lightly is not conducive to solving the problem."" Wang's comments echoed those of Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin, who said the Security Council would have overstepped its responsibilities had it approved the resolution. ""Recently, in the positions of a number of council member states, we have seen an ever-more-obvious attempt to take the council beyond its chartered prerogatives and beyond maintaining international peace and security,"" Churkin said. ""We believe such practices to be illegitimate and dangerous, leading to a realignment of the entire U.N. system."" Churkin also noted that, had the resolution been approved, council members would have ignored appeals from the African Union to let the South African talks take place. He also accused the council of missing an opportunity to coordinate a response that would have ""promoted the success of the political dialogue"" in Zimbabwe. Speaking before the vote, Zimbabwean Ambassador Boniface Chidyausiku said his nation has been a victim of ""incessant meddling"" from the international community. Chidyausiku blamed sanctions already imposed on Zimbabwe for its underperforming economy and the suffering of its people. South African Ambassador Dumisani Kumalo also urged the Security Council to give the South African talks a chance to bring about a resolution. U.S. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad said the United States was disappointed at the veto. ""China and Russia have stood with Mugabe against the people of Zimbabwe ... for reasons that we think are not borne out by the facts on the ground,"" he said. ""The U-turn on the Russian position is particularly surprising and disturbing,"" he said, noting that a few days ago, the Russian Federation was supportive of a statement adopted at the Group of Eight meeting in Japan expressing ""grave concern"" about the situation in Zimbabwe. ""The Russian performance here today raises questions about its reliability as a G-8 partner,"" Khalilzad said. The draft resolution expressed ""deep concern at the gross irregularities"" during the presidential election, saying violence and intimidation before the runoff prevented ""free and fair elections,"" creating ""an environment that did not permit international election observers to operate freely before the June 27 vote."" The United Kingdom, which has been highly critical of Mugabe, was a chief supporter of the United States push for sanctions. France also supported the resolution. ""The Security Council has failed to shoulder its responsibility to do what it can to prevent a national tragedy deepening and spreading its effects across southern Africa,"" British Ambassador John Sawers said after the vote.  Watch the British Ambassador to the U.N. speaks about the failed resolution » . Sawers also questioned Mbeki's efficacy as a mediator in Zimbabwe's affairs. ""We have to be realistic. Those efforts have so far come to naught. The only one who has benefited to date is Mr. Mugabe,"" he said. After the vote, Chidyausiku thanked the council for heeding his call. ""Today we have seen reason,"" he said. ""I want to express our gratitude to the people in the Security Council who managed to see reason and refused to be intimidated or cowed into following the national interests of the U.S. and UK."" The Zimbabwean people, he said, are ""committed to resolve their differences.""

"(CNN) -- When faced with a dare on ""The Talk"" on Tuesday, co-host Sara Gilbert picked truth instead.

""I really do believe in facing your fears and doing things that make you uncomfortable,"" she explained, ""but I actually can't do the dare because I'm pregnant.""

"Jinan, China (CNN) -- I've eaten some unusual things on the road. There were salted Mopani worms in Botswana at the hotel buffet (black and squishy); sun-dried nsenene grasshoppers in Uganda (yellow and juicy); whole roasted goat in the desert in Mauritania (delicious), and chicken head and feet soup in Beijing (only unusual if you are not from China). Officially, my travel advice to you is this well-worn phrase: If you can't boil it, cook it or peel it, then don't eat it. But between you, me, and the screen, sometimes it's best to put the energy bars and canned nuts aside and feed your culinary curiosity. That's just what I was challenged to do when I visited a thriving cockroach farm in Jinan, China. But more on that later. An appetite for adventure . Some of my favorite travel experiences have been of eating street food or home-cooked delicacies that I have never heard of before. After 10 hours in the desert sun, chicken barbequed on a coal fire in Chad tastes like a Michelin-starred offering. And I don't know what the guy put into his pot of chicken and broth in the foothills of the Himalayas, but it was worth choking on the smoke from the stove inside his hut. There are pitfalls for the adventurous eater. I have yet to meet a journalist with a well-worn passport who hasn't had a bout or two of gut-wrenching giardiasis (I will spare you the details). And sometimes you do regret a culinary decision (goat-bile on the shores of Lake Victoria, I'm talking to you). Occasionally, it's best to say ""no"" -- so I declined the dried mice in Malawi skewered on a stick and offered by the side of the highway, despite the insistence of our producer. Which all gets me, in a roundabout way, to Wang Fuming, the kingpin of cockroaches in Jinan, China. Scuttling legs . Wang has a dream: To put roaches on plates and bowls throughout China as a high protein meal. ""I love these cockroaches, I feel very close to them,"" he tells me. In a tumble-down industrial district on the shabby outskirts of Jinan, Wang farms millions of cockroaches. Ten million before ""harvest time,"" he tells me. He keeps the roaches in warehouses with narrow corridors and hives made of cement roof shingles. Stepping inside is like a waking nightmare or a scene from the film ""Alien."" There's a strong smell of ammonia and the sound of scuttling legs. Wang breeds American cockroaches (actually, they're originally from Africa) and he sells them to pharmaceutical companies in China by the ton. They are usually ground and stuffed into pills and advertised as a cure for all manner of stomach, heart, and liver ailments. In recent years, they have become a staple in Chinese medicine shops here, promising wondrous results. Cockroach medicine is having something of a boom. Crunchy, with an aftertaste . But Wang prefers them fresh and wants me to try one, so he drags a gas stove into his office and throws a steel bowl full of roaches into peanut oil. He promptly scoops them out. ""Is that it?"" I ask. ""No, twice fried,"" he says, throwing them back into the oil. After which, Wang promptly starts tucking in. He really seems to enjoy it. ""I felt so much better after I started eating cockroaches,"" he says. Now, all that is left is for me to try one. Wang points out a suitable roach on the corner of the dish. ""Its wings have come off, so it's easier to eat,"" he says. I pop it in my mouth and chew -- American roaches are, unfortunately, too big to swallow whole. The verdict. They're crunchy, like a spindly overcooked French fry, and they leave an aftertaste that has serious staying power. I realize that roaches may not be the best way to convince you to be an adventurous eater, but think of them as the standard bearer. Or take Wang's word for it. ""If you don't try it, you will regret it for the rest of your life,"" he exclaims.","CNN's David McKenzie has tasted everything from worms to grasshoppers while on the road .

"(CNN) -- Since the disappearance of Amelia Earhart, no aviation search has garnered more attention than the loss of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. The disappearance has become the mystery of the century. It is baffling both to the public and to aviation experts alike, myself included. First, let's not forget to find compassion for the families and friends of the passengers on board this flight. Accident investigations are aimed at finding them an answer, at discovering the cause of such tragedies and at preventing them from ever happening again. Rather than delve into the numerous sabotage/terrorist theories, I'd like to focus on mechanical malfunction. Considering all the facts, or the accepted assumption of facts, a malfunction that overwhelmed the crew may still be a viable explanation. This makes the most sense to me, as a 30-year airline veteran. Opinion: Flight 370''s resting place is best clue . Piecing together all the current information as of March 24, I'll describe a chronological scenario. The scenario is pure speculation on my part, and I have included commentary at various points. 0. The captain utilizes a PC-based flight simulator and deletes some files. So what? My take: This is a hobby. The captain is passionate about flying. Did he fly only the 777 in the simulator? He could well have flown other types of aircraft in the simulator, for his own purposes. Regardless, he wouldn't require this device to execute a nefarious plot. An 18,000-hour captain already has all the resources, i.e. charts and manuals, including his own experience. 1. The captain completes a cell phone call prior to takeoff. Judging by the distance from the main terminal to the runway, this cell phone call was most likely made after pushback from the gate at Kuala Lumpur. Yes, this was a violation of the sterile period (during which extraneous activity outside of aircraft operations should not occur) and not quite up to professional standards but not a big deal. Most likely, the captain made the call while the airplane had been safely stopped on a taxiway. It does not imply malicious intent. As of this writing, information has not been released regarding the details of the phone call. 2. At 12:36 a.m., Malaysia 370 contacts the Kuala Lumpur tower and receives a clearance to hold short of Runway 32R at the departure end, my translation from a non-verified transcript. 3. At 12:40 a.m., Malaysia 370 receives clearance to take off. 4. At 12:42 a.m., Malaysia 370 receives a clearance to climb to 18,000 feet and is directed to the IGARI waypoint, approximately 300 miles away, the entry point into Vietnam's airspace. 5. Although the transcript timeline seems abridged, having eliminated communication with other aircraft that had to be on the frequency, it appears that the co-pilot reported the altitude level at 35,000 feet on three occasions. Apparently, this repeated report has caused concern. My colleagues will agree that the most diplomatic method to remind an air-traffic controller that you had requested a higher altitude would be to state your current altitude. It's a subtle hint in air-traffic control parlance. Maybe the original clearance was filed for a higher flight level than 35,000 feet. 6. At 1:07, ACARS (the Automatic Communication and Reporting System) gives what turns out to be its final report. Also at this time, it was alleged that an additional waypoint not on the original flight plan had been entered into the flight management computer. The implication is that someone in the cockpit had intent to veer off-course for nefarious purposes. I believe that if indeed a waypoint was entered -- and it seems difficult to verify with the ACARS no longer reporting -- it was entered as a means to identify an equal-time point. Such a point is a position on the route that indicates the flight is equal in time to two or more diversionary airports. It is a required dispatch calculation prior to departure but an optional entry on the flight management computer. 7. At 1:19, a Kuala Lumpur Center air-traffic controller instructs Malaysia 370 to contact Ho Chi Minh Center (Vietnam radar) on frequency 120.9. The co-pilot responds with the now-famous ""All right, good night."" Although the correct response would have been to repeat the frequency, the co-pilot was informal. Not a big deal. Crews that have flown that route know that the frequency doesn't change. It is printed on the en route chart. 8. At 1:21, the transponder ceases to send out its coded discrete signal that identifies the flight. Perhaps the beginning of a malfunction in the electronics and engineering compartment? 9. At 1:37, the automatic ACARS transmission does not give its 30-minute report. Had the problem become a full-blown emergency? 10. An undocumented report that a Narita, Japan-bound flight is asked by Ho Chi Minh Center to attempt contact with Malaysia 370. The Narita flight is approximately 30 minutes ahead but is unable to establish contact with Malaysia 370. This attempted ""relay"" would have been a typical procedure used by air-traffic control. Ho Chi Minh Center would have first attempted contact on the assigned frequency and then used the emergency frequency that all controllers and airlines monitor. There is cause for concern but no reason just yet to sound the alarm. 11. At 2:15, Malaysian military radar (disclosed one week after the disappearance) claims to have observed a primary target on the west side of the Malaysian peninsula, indicating that the flight flew a westerly course at some point after the last verbal transmission. In my view, the above timeline only includes what appears to be the most credible assertions. Subsequent to this timeline, reports of satellite ""pings"" and engine data being transmitted indicate that the airplane may have remained airborne for an additional five to seven hours. Without verification and true understanding regarding the implications of these reports, it is difficult to speculate. Coming together: Flight 370 search unites global community . In addition, raw data from another radar site indicated that the 777 may have climbed to an altitude above the airplane's certified ceiling and then quickly descended and climbed again. And now the most recent assertion has the airplane descending to 12,000 feet. If in fact the airplane descended to 12,000 feet, its fuel consumption would have been almost double that at the higher altitudes. In that regard, how did the airplane fly so far south into the Indian Ocean, as has now been announced emphatically by the Malaysian Prime Minister? Assuming the airplane did indeed continue to fly, here is a hypothetical scenario: . A smoldering fire began to affect the components in the electronics and engineering compartment. The fire was insidious, producing smoke at a slowly increasing rate. As components began to fail, the crew followed appropriate checklists until it was determined that the primary concern was to land the airplane. The captain entered the waypoint identifier for a diversionary airport into the flight management computer. The autopilot turned the airplane toward the diversionary airport, a southwesterly direction. In the meantime, the crew attempted to control an airplane that may have been losing portions of its electronic flight control systems. Primary flight displays on the instrument panel may have begun to shut down, making it difficult to interpret airplane attitude and airspeed. The crew donned their oxygen masks with the integral goggles, but toxic fumes, low visibility etc. eventually overcame them when the oxygen bottled was depleted due to the pilots both breathing rapidly in a high-stress environment and the mask switch most likely being selected to 100% at high pressure. A degraded autopilot continued to steer the airplane toward the diversion airport at an altitude selected by the crew. When the airplane reached the last waypoint -- the diversionary airport -- the flight management computer functioned as designed and kept the airplane on its last heading. Fuel exhaustion caused the engines to flame out one at a time. Operating on one engine for a brief period may have caused a turn due to the differential power that couldn't be compensated by a degraded automatic system. When the autopilot could no longer maintain the airplane at the selected altitude, it disconnected. The airplane would have begun a slow, erratic descent. When the last engine shut down, the ram air turbine would have deployed, providing both limited hydraulic power and limited electric power. Eventually, the airplane would have descended and crashed into the ocean. A lot of focus has been on the fact that the crew did not communicate the problem. Maybe they did attempt to declare a ""mayday."" Had the primary radios been destroyed by fire? Or more likely, the communication went unheard because the airspace where the malfunction occurred was just out of the range of normal VHF communications, in addition to being just outside Ho Chi Minh Center's radar. It is all pure speculation until the airplane is located. I'd like to keep an open mind. Regardless, perhaps I've explained some of the unexplainable. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Les Abend.","Pilot Les Abend: Evidence on Flight 370 is consistent with a mechanical concern .

All explanations are speculative until the plane's components are found, Abend says ."
"(CNN) -- Russia still has about 1,000 troops inside eastern Ukraine, a NATO military officer said Thursday, a week after Ukraine's government and pro-Russian rebels agreed to a ceasefire aimed at ending months of conflict. NATO also sees 20,000 more Russian troops aligned along the border, the NATO officer told CNN. He was not named according to standard practice in the organization. NATO believes that these numbers amount to a large and effective military force, the officer said. In addition to the troop numbers, NATO continues to see sophisticated Russian military equipment in Ukraine. NATO remains concerned and urges Russia to engage with the international community and Ukraine to find a political solution to the crisis, the officer said. Moscow has consistently denied allegations by Kiev and the West that Russia has troops in Ukraine, and that it has armed and supported the rebels. On Wednesday, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said some 70% of the Russian troops believed to have been in Ukraine had withdrawn back across the border, according to the national news agency Ukrinform. Information released by Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council on Thursday indicated that the rebel forces control a strip of eastern Ukraine running from the city of Luhansk down to the Sea of Azov. 'Very fragile' ceasefire . The truce was signed Friday after talks in Minsk, Belarus, between representatives of Ukraine, the rebels and Russia. But more substantive talks on issues, including the decentralization of power and constitutional reform in Ukraine, must still take place before a lasting resolution can be found. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Aleksandr Lukashevich told a briefing Thursday that the ceasefire was ""very fragile"" and that both sides must implement the framework agreed to in Minsk. ""There is mounting evidence of the Kiev government strengthening its military groups in different areas, regions; there are eyewitness reports to prove it,"" he said, ""though Ukrainian authorities keep on reassuring us that they're not planning a military operation."" Lukashevich said Russia was also surprised by NATO's announcement of plans to hold joint military exercises with Kiev in Ukraine later this year. ""This might cause the escalation (of the situation) and put the progress in peaceful settlement of the crisis in Ukraine under threat,"" he warned. New sanctions . A new round of European Union sanctions against Russia over its actions in Ukraine will come into force Friday, European Council President Herman Van Rompuy said Thursday. EU officials will review the implementation of the ceasefire before the end of the month, he said, after which the sanctions could be amended or lifted. The sanctions include tougher restrictions on Russia's access to EU capital markets; a ban on loans by EU companies or individuals to five major Russian state-owned banks; a ban on debt financing to three major Russian defense companies and three major energy companies; and an asset freeze and travel ban against 24 more individuals. This means 119 people in total are now subject to sanctions, while 23 entities remain under an asset freeze in the European Union. Russia has warned it will respond to any additional measures. In his remarks, Lukashevich said the deadly crash in July of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 -- which Kiev and the West believe was shot down from rebel-held territory using a Russian-made missile launcher -- was being used to justify the imposition of broad Western sanctions against Russia. A preliminary report into the crash released this week by Dutch investigators did not apportion blame for the crash but said the plane was brought down by ""high-energy objects"" from outside. The United States will join the European Union in implementing additional sanctions against Russia over its ""illegal actions in Ukraine,"" President Obama said Thursday. ""We will deepen and broaden sanctions in Russia's financial, energy, and defense sectors,"" he said. The administration will outline the specifics of the sanctions Friday. ""We are implementing these new measures in light of Russia's actions to further destabilize Ukraine over the last month, including through the presence of heavily armed Russian forces in eastern Ukraine. We are watching closely developments since the announcement of the ceasefire and agreement in Minsk, but we have yet to see conclusive evidence that Russia has ceased its efforts to destabilize Ukraine,"" Obama said. Aid convoy . Lukashevich also said there had not yet been a ""breakthrough"" allowing a new Russian aid convoy to start moving into Ukraine in the next few days. ""We hope that the delivery will be carried out with participation of Ukraine's border guards and customs officers as well as officials from the International Committee of the Red Cross,"" he said. ""We hope, however, that the coordination would not be dragged out."" A previous convoy carrying aid for civilians caught up in the fighting in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions was sent over the border by Russia without permission from Ukrainian authorities. The Presidents of Russia and Ukraine are ""broadly satisfied"" with the status of the ceasefire, Kremlin foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov told Russia's Interfax news agency on Wednesday.

"(CNN) -- ""The Mortal Instruments"" may not have taken off in theaters, but that doesn't mean it can't work on TV. According to The Hollywood Reporter, production company Constantin has hired a showrunner to help translate Cassandra Clare's popular young adult series to the small screen as a ""high-end drama."" The first adaptation of Clare's ""The Mortal Instruments"" was introduced in theaters to dismal results in 2013. ""The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones"" starred Lily Collins as a young woman who learns she's part of an ancient league of demon hunters, and performed poorly enough to put the hope of a ""Mortal Instruments"" franchise in jeopardy. It was not only pilloried by critics, but also earned just $31 million domestically -- not a good start compared to other blockbuster YA adaptations like ""The Hunger Games,"" which earned $408 million domestically for its first film, and ""Twilight,"" which earned $192 million. At first, production company Constantin was going to examine moving forward with additional movie releases of author Clare's novels, but it seems the company has now set its focus on TV. Unlike a theatrical release, which usually has a running time of one to two hours, a TV production would allow a more intricate and expansive telling of Clare's work. Constantin has reportedly tapped Ed Decter as showrunner, and has the goal of launching production next year.","""The Mortal Instruments"" could soon be a TV series .

"(CNN) -- Gleaming skyscrapers towering over upwardly mobile professionals and flashy cars cruising along brightly lit avenues; young urbanites zipping past manicured lawns to enter their luxury condos; state-of-the-art labs fostering tech savvy entrepreneurs' million-dollar ideas. A glimpse of Africa's urban future or utopian fantasies? The jury might still be out, but these are the snapshots of urban life being touted by international property developers who are announcing plans for new satellite cities and vast modern compounds across Africa. They are usually planned to be built from scratch on the edges of the continent's existing metropolises, many of which are creaking under the weight of growing populations and rapid urbanization rates. From the Konza technopolis outside Nairobi, to King City near the emerging port of Takoradi, Ghana, through the luxurious Eko Atlantic on Victoria Island in Lagos, these urban projects are designed to offer high-quality services and modern infrastructure. They're typically branded as smart and futuristic, combining leisure facilities, business opportunities and social amenities for their residents -- from schools and medical centers to shopping malls, theaters and restaurants. Out of touch? Yet not everyone is convinced. Critics warn that many of these new developments will only serve a tiny elite, exacerbating an already deep divide between the haves and have-nots. ""They are essentially designed for people with money,"" says Vanessa Watson, professor of city planning at the University of Cape Town. She describes many of the plans as unsustainable ""urban fantasies"" that ignore the reality of African cities, where most people are still poor and live informally. ""What many of these new cities are doing will result in the exclusion and the forced removal of those kind of informal areas, which quite often are on well-located land,"" says Watson. In some cases, entire settlements have been relocated and large plots of land have been cleared to make way for the proposed projects. Watch this: A new town, with few residents . Critics also bemoan a lack of adequate research to gauge the impact of some new developments on the local environment and economies. They point out the ""ghost town"" of Kilamba in Angola, a grandiose project often labeled as a white elephant. Built afresh outside the capital Luanda, Kilamba was designed to accommodate hundreds of thousands of people but remains largely empty due to its expensive housing and unfavorable location. But for others, these new developments have the potential to reshape Africa's urban future. ""Our objective is to provide the basic infrastructure, planning and necessary management framework in creating satellite cities that reverses the current trend of unplanned development and urban congestion in most of Africa's growing cities,"" says Tim Beighton, of Rendeavour, which is developing several new cities in Africa. Here, CNN takes a look at some of these bold projects. Tell us what you think about them in the comments section below. Konza - Kenya . Dubbed as ""Africa's Silicon Savannah,"" Konza Techno City is the Kenyan government's flagship mega project designed to foster the growth of the country's technology industry. The multi-billion dollar city, located on a 5,000-acre plot of land some 60 kilometers southeast of the capital Nairobi, aims to create nearly 100,000 jobs by 2030. It will feature a central business district, a university campus, urban parks and housing to accommodate some 185,000 people. Appolonia, King City - Ghana . Designed by Rendeavour, the urban development branch of Moscow-based Renaissance Group, Appolonia and King City will be located in Greater Accra and Western Ghana respectively. The mixed-use satellite cites are expected to accommodate more than 160,000 residents on land developed for housing properties, retail and commercial centers, as well as schools, healthcare and other social amenities. Rendeavour says that all baseline studies, master plans and detailed designs have been completed and approved, while basic infrastructure work in Appolonia is expected to begin in the third quarter of 2013. Eko Atlantic - Nigeria . Eko Atlantic is a multi-billion dollar residential and business development that will be located on Victoria Island in Lagos, along its upmarket Bar Beach coastline. Read this: Lagos of the future . The ambitious project is being built on 10 square kilometers of land reclaimed from the Atlantic Ocean. Eko Atlantic is expected to provide upscale accommodation for 250,000 people and employment opportunities for a further 150,000. Tatu City - Kenya . Also being developed by Rendeavour, Tatu City will span 1,035 hectares of land some 15 kilometers from Nairobi. It is designed to create a new decentralized urban center to the north of the bustling Kenyan capital. Construction work began last May and the whole project is projected to be completed in 10 phases by 2022. When finalized, the mixed-use satellite city is expected to be home to 77,000 residents. La Cite du Fleuve - Democratic Republic of Congo . La Cite du Fleuve is a luxurious housing project planned for two islands on the Congo River in Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo and one of Africa's fastest growing cities. Developer Hawkwood Properties plans to reclaim about 375 hectares of sandbanks and swamps to build thousands of riverside villas, offices and shopping centers over the next 10 years. It says that more than 20 hectares of land have already been reclaimed. Hope City - Ghana . Hope City is a $10 billion high-tech hub that will be built outside Accra, aiming to turn Ghana into a major ICT player. The planned hub, which is hoped will house 25,000 residents and create jobs for 50,000 people, will be made up of six towers of different dimensions, including a 75-story, 270 meter-high building that is expected to be the highest in Africa. Read this: Ghana's $10 billion tech city . Ghanaian company RLG Communications is financing 30% of the project, while the remainder will be funded by a wide array of investors and through a stock-buying scheme. Its sustainable facilities will include an assembly plant for various tech products, business offices, an IT university and a hospital, as well as restaurants, theaters and sports centers. Kigali - Rwanda . The capital and biggest city of Rwanda has launched an ambitious urban development plan to transform itself into the ""center of urban excellence in Africa."" Watch this: Kigali's vision for 2020 . The bold and radical 2020 Kigali Conceptual Master Plan includes all the hallmarks of a regional hub for business, trade and tourism. It envisages Singapore-like commercial and shopping districts boasting glass-box skyscrapers and modern hotels, as well as green-themed parks and entertainment facilities.

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama has had a tough year. Although he began in January well aware of the immense problems that second-term presidents have historically confronted, it still doesn't seem that he was fully prepared for what was to come. The past 12 months have found the president struggling to protect his domestic policies from attack and to maintain control of the national agenda. Obama began the year enjoying the glow of his reelection against Mitt Romney. The year ended with his approval ratings plummeting; more and more Americans reported that they didn't trust Obama. Many of the main items on his agenda -- tax reform, gun control, immigration reform, and climate change -- are languishing. What factors made this year so difficult? The toughest challenge that President Obama faced has been the continuing ruthless opposition he has encountered on Capitol Hill. Congressional Republicans have maintained their aggressive stance toward the administration, using the legislative process to achieve their objectives. The most tangible example of this strategy has been their threat to not raise the debt ceiling to force the president into several weeks of confrontation over the budget. Even as their own party approval ratings plummeted, Republicans displayed a fierce determination to move forward with their strategy. Part of the problem stems from the fact that House Republicans play to their activist base, which will shape the primaries in their safe districts, rather than to independent voters. Tea party Republicans control enough of the House Caucus to force the speaker into their corner if he wants to keep his job. Although Obama held his ground on the final outcome of the debt ceiling battle, the budget brinkmanship consumed a huge amount of valuable political time. If Congress passes the current budget deal, it will create a temporary pause in the budget wars, but the battles have already taken their toll . Republicans used other tactics as well. They stifled Obama's federal judicial nominations and executive appointments, until Senate Democrats became so frustrated that they changed the filibuster rules (a true sign of desperation in the upper chamber!). House Republicans refused to move forward with an immigration bill with bipartisan support sent to them from the Senate, and conducted many hearings about the president's health care program trying to find scandal in a story about poor implementation. That brings us to Obama's second challenge in 2013, one that did not come from his opponents but the failures of management and organization of his own administration. After his health care program had survived judicial and legislative challenge, all eyes turned to see what the Affordable Care Act would look like when the government launched the federal online health care exchange on October 1. The results were not pretty. The website was filled with problems. The system kept crashing when people tried to sign on. It gradually became clear that the site was not even prepared to disseminate the information about who purchased insurance to the insurers. Investigative stories soon revealed that high-level officials had been aware of these problems long before the web site went live, and failed to properly prepare. Two months later the administration was able to get the system running relatively smoothly, as far as we now know. But the embarrassment of the first weeks had its cost on American's confidence in the program, as well as in the President. Political scientist Theda Skocpol has reminded us that Social Security policymaker Wilbur Cohen, an iconic figure in the 1950s and 1960s, once said that Medicare was 1% inspiration and 99% implementation. In a toxic political atmosphere, Obama caused huge problems for himself with the way that he handled the 99% of the job. And Obama has continued to struggle in the politics of perception. This has been a weakness of this administration from the start of his first term. Obama is a politician who maintains an unending belief in rationality. He refuses to embrace the frenzied media environment where it is often difficult to tell fact from fiction. Since taking office, Obama has continued to hold firm to the idea that over time voters will pay attention to the facts, and that the candidate with the best argument will win. Sometimes, particularly on foreign policy, his outlook has proven to be correct. But on many other occasions he has seen how quickly the national conversation can shift as the president stood silent. When Obama persuaded Congress to pass an economic stimulus bill in 2009, the administration did little to sell the program. Even though it was a modest program, heavily weighted toward tax cuts rather than government spending, conservatives branded it as a failed big-spending program that did nothing for the economy. When Congress passed a health care program in 2010 that left the private insurance system fully intact and avoided anything looking like a national health insurance plan, the White House stood still as Republicans defined the bill as big government gone wild. It was especially important that the White House respond aggressively this year before the rollout, but it did not. The public never got fully behind the law, let alone understood it. The President has also allowed small stories to shift public discussion. Most recently, he delivered a major address on inequality in America. The speech was meant to outline an agenda for the rest of his presidency and provide a framework for the policies that he would pursue. Within a few days of the speech, however, many reporters had refocused on new pseudo-scandals, such as the revelation that Obama once lived with an uncle who was almost deported as a result of a drunken-driving arrest. Administration officials might rightly complain that these kinds of stories have little to do with the underlying issues facing the nation, but they still reflect the kind of media environment all presidents face. From marketing their programs to fighting back against smaller scandals, the President's team needs to do a much better job in the politics of information. In apparent recognition of this failing, the administration is adding John Podesta, Phil Schiliro, and Katie Beirne Fallon to the White House team. In the realm of national security, Obama also struggled in the face of the ongoing disclosures over the NSA surveillance program. Major leaks have revealed the extensive spying that the United States has undertaken within the United States and overseas, revelations that have angered many of the President's supporters who had believed he would do things differently than President George W. Bush. The one area where the president has experienced slightly more positive outcomes are in foreign policy. In confronting a series of crises -- including Syria's use of chemical weapons against rebels and Iran's nuclear buildup -- Secretary of State John Kerry has put in place a series of temporary deals that aim to curb these threats. Although the verdict is out on both of these, and each deal can backfire on the administration if they don't work out, for the time being the White House has calmed the storms. Obama's supporters should hope that the tough moments of the year turn into learning moments for the President, hardening him for the coming year and giving him a better roadmap about how to push for his agenda in the upcoming year. They might take some solace from President Ronald Reagan, who enjoyed some of his most important accomplishments in his final years in office -- the signing of the INF Treaty with the Soviet Union -- as well as President Bill Clinton, whose approval ratings skyrocketed in his final years. The good news for the president is that there is time left to win back public support and build on his record for the history textbooks. He also can gain some optimism from the fact that he is facing a deeply divided Republican Party whose approval ratings are even worse than his. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: President Barack Obama suffered many reverses in 2013 .

"(CNN) -- Congratulations, members of Congress: A new poll finds that you're not viewed as having the lowest ethical standards of any profession in the country! You edged out car salesman for that honor. Of course, you're viewed as the second worst profession in terms of honesty and ethics, but hey, savor this moment -- you've earned it. At least these are the findings of a Gallup poll released this week that asked people to rate ""the honesty and ethical standards of people"" in different professions. Besides Congress and car salesmen, also bringing up the rear in this poll are the usual suspects, among them lawyers, stockbrokers and bankers. Topping the list of professions we find most ethical were nurses, followed by pharmacists and doctors. Dentists came in lower, but I doubt that dentists are truly less honorable than M.D.s; it's just that dentists seem to enjoy causing us so much pain that this may be our way of paying them back. In reviewing the poll results, I am left with a few burning questions. First, how can car salesmen be viewed as less trustworthy than Congress? It wasn't the guys at the local Ford or Chrysler dealership who caused our government to lose its AAA credit rating. And they aren't the ones who can't agree on a budget deal while we collectively stare into the abyss of the ""fiscal cliff."" In fact, I have no doubt that a group of car salesmen could iron out a deal on the budget quicker than our recalcitrant Congress -- plus get us all to buy some undercoating for our cars to boot. But here are my bigger questions about this poll. Do we really care about the ethics of the people in these professions? Does it truly matter to us whether they are honest? If we actually did care about the moral fitness of Congress, why would we re-elect them to the tune of 91% in 2012? If honesty truly meant something to us, wouldn't we have voted out at least half of them? Even 25%? But no, when given a chance last month to vote out Congress, we sent home only 9% of those up for re-election. And let's look at lawyers, a profession consistently viewed as ethically challenged. Before I saw the light and became a comedian, I was a practicing attorney for about six years. I can tell you firsthand that my clients never, ever asked me about ethics. What did my clients always ask me about? How do we win -- be it a lawsuit or negotiations. (Followed by: How much is this going to cost me?) I even had clients tell me, in essence: I don't care what you have to do to win this case; win it, or I will find a lawyer who will. It was up to me to rein in my clients who wanted to go beyond what was ethically permissible. Let's consider stockbrokers, also a profession that wallows in the pit of perceived low ethics. If your stockbroker had a tip for you that was not illegal but was ethically ambiguous, would you execute the trade based on that info if it could make you a nice payday? Or what about your accountant? Would you support her recommendation to take a ""questionable"" deduction that would save you a nice chunk of money? Honestly, have you ever heard someone brag that their lawyer, accountant or financial planner was the most ethical, honest person they ever met? Unlikely. But I bet you heard people say things like ""My accountant is amazing at finding loopholes,"" ""my broker gets me great returns on my money every year"" or ""my lawyer is a killer."" We want the meat, but we don't want to know how the calf is forced to live in a crate or how the lobster is boiled alive. We want tender veal, tasty seafood, lawyers who win cases and brokers who make us money. We want results. But when a poll comes around about ethics, we are all of a sudden holier than thou. We scoff at others' apparent moral bankruptcy. We joke about their lack of ethics. We convince ourselves that we are ethically superior to them. Yet in the very same instance, we re-elect them to Congress. We retain them to represent us in legal proceedings. We hire them to manage our money. And when they do a good job, we recommend them to friends. So here are my real questions about this poll: Who really are the unethical ones here? Who truly deserves to be on the bottom of the list of honest people? Them or us? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","A Gallup poll says Congress has the second-lowest ethical standards of any profession .

"Fort Worth, Texas (CNN) -- An internet troll reviled for his pornographic posts on Reddit and recently revealed as a middle-aged software programmer told CNN that he made ""a huge mistake."" For years, 49-year-old Michael Brutsch hid behind the online screen name ""Violentacrez,"" creating hundreds of subforums on the user-generated website, such as ""Rapebait,"" ""Incest,"" ""Pics of Dead Kids,"" ""Choke a Bitch,"" and ""Rape Jokes."" ""Violentacrez"" has been banned from the site several times, although Brutsch still maintains a separate account. Last week, Gawker revealed the identity of ""Violentacrez,"" whose posts generated as many as 800,000 subscribers and triggered a debate about whether Reddit was criminally liable for the content of its forums. Reddit is a website where the popularity of posts -- and whether they are featured prominently on the site's main page -- is determined by registered users' votes. Days after the Gawker article, Brutsch agreed to talk exclusively to CNN on camera at a hotel room in Fort Worth, about six miles from his home. He said his employer fired him after the Gawker article. He had worked there for seven years. ""One of the problems that came around and bit me in the ass was that I didn't really think about what I was doing,"" Brutsch told CNN. ""And I didn't listen to people when they said, 'You really shouldn't do this.'"" Brutsch -- who is married, with a stepdaughter as well as a son and a stepson who are both in the U.S. military -- told CNN he started out posting ""mostly soft-core porn,"" such as ""pictures of naked girls, that sort of thing."" ""And as I'd find porn of different types, like if it was a picture of an African-American woman, I created a Reddit called 'Women of Color,'"" Brutsch said. ""If it was, you know, a woman with large breasts, I created a Reddit called 'Boobies.'"" Years ago, Brutsch created his most infamous Reddit forum called ""Jailbait"" -- images of teenage girls posted without their or their families' consent. He said it became so popular, drawing hundreds of thousands of page views, that Reddit gave him an award -- a gold-plated bobblehead doll ""for making significant contributions to the site."" In an email to CNN, Reddit said Brutsch had won a community vote for ""Worst Subreddit"" and Reddit now ""regrets having sent the trophy."" Reddit also said it banned Brutsch's ""Violentacrez"" account several times since last year, adding that it ""regret(s) not taking stronger action sooner."" Looking back, Brutsch said his actions ""were a huge mistake."" He claimed he was addicted to Reddit and could not stop himself. The biggest thrill Brutsch said he got ""was those meaningless Internet points,"" earned when ""Redditors"" voted for his posts. Now that he's lost his job, Brutsch told CNN he was sorry -- but he didn't say exactly what he was apologizing for. ""Well, I am to some degree apologizing for what I did,"" Brutsch said. ""Again, I was playing to an audience of college kids. And you know, when two years ago, when all of this was at its height, the audience was appreciative and supportive of the sort of gallows humor that I put out there."" Legal analysts are split on whether Reddit is breaking any laws by allowing its users to post such heinous images. Reddit stressed in its email to CNN that it ""follows all the legal requirements regarding illegal content, including reporting to the proper authorities. ""By its nature, moderators at Reddit have complete control over the subsections they start unless they violate site rules or the law,"" it said. CNN legal contributor Sunny Hostin said she believes the website is hosting ""borderline kiddie porn."" CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin noted that while the website may not be breaking any criminal laws, its claim that it cannot interfere with its posters because they are protected by the First Amendment is ""not true."" ""If I say something terrible to you on the phone, you can sue me -- you can't sue the phone company,"" Toobin explained on CNN's AC360 last year. ""A website is different. A website automatically exercises some control. You can see they have rules there. So the idea that they have no control over their posters, that's simply wrong."" Brutsch has not been charged with a crime. He was, however, questioned by police because of assertions that he had sex with his stepdaughter. He said it's not true.

"(CNN) -- UEFA president Michel Platini is confident German Chancellor Angela Merkel would attend the final of Euro 2012 in Ukraine -- if Germany reach the tournament's showpiece in Kiev on July 1. Together with European Union commissioners and several other Western politicians, Merkel has threatened to boycott the month-long tournament, which Ukraine is co-hosting with Poland next month, in sympathy with jailed Ukrainian opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko. ""I'm not worried about the situation,"" Platini told CNN in an exclusive interview ahead of Saturday's Champions League final between Bayern Munich and Chelsea in the German city. ""The politicians they are in their role and the Ukrainians they are in their role. I'm in my role and that is not to do politics, it's not to do religion and not to interfere in everything. ""That means they can say what they want -- we continue to organize the Euro. If Germany is in final of the Euro I would be sure that Madame Merkel would come to the final."" Such a scenario -- and it is very possible given Germany are one of the tournament favorites -- would represent something of a u-turn for Merkel given earlier this month she told the Bundestag, the lower house of the German Parliament, that in Ukraine and Belarus ""people are still suffering under dictatorship and repression."" No regrets . While admitting UEFA had taken a risk in giving Euro 2012 to Poland and Ukraine, Platini insisted he had no regrets about the European governing body's decision to award the tournament to the two Eastern European neighbors. ""Four years ago when all the slides were red, red, red, red, red -- stadium, roads, accommodation was red, red, red, red it was not easy. OK we took the risk but I say it was a good risk."" As well as dealing with the political fall-out from Ukraine's strained relationship with the West, UEFA is implementing a set of financial regulations -- Financial Fair Play (FFP) - that are designed to compel most teams to live within their means. The FFP rules apply now but will come fully into force in 2014. But this new stringent financial regime has raised the question as to whether UEFA would prevent a big-spending team like Manchester City, which has incurred large debts after spending up to $1.5B on winning the English Premier League (EPL) for the first time this season, from competing in the Champions League. ""I'm happy for them,"" said Platini, as he congratulated City on their title success. ""But they will know what we will do. And if they are in the Financial Fair Play they will play our competition but we will look at them like we will look at everyone else. ""We prepare everything with the clubs -- we gave them four years to prepare something for the future,"" added Platini. ""We will never go back."" Technology opposed . The former Nancy and Juventus midfielder and French captain, who led France when they won the European Championships in 1984, remains equally resolute in his opposition to FIFA's likely introduction of goal-line technology in the summer. The EPL wants to introduce goal-line technology as early as next season if football's rule-makers -- The International Football Association Board (IFAB) -- sanction its use in July. ""I'm against the technology,"" said Platini. ""If you say OK to goal-line technology, then it is offside technology, then penalty area technology, and we stop the football. I want human people -- it's easy. I understand the fans because they want justice but with an additional referee we have the same justice."" FIFA president Sepp Blatter has indicated he is in favor of goal-line technology and would like to see it in place for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, but Platini has not given up all hope that the Swiss may still change his mind. ""I am football, he is political."" said Platini. ""He changes his mind. He said last year in the IFAB never technology, never. This year he changed, he's says let's go technology. I hope next year he will say no technology."" Looking ahead to Saturday's showpiece event between Chelsea and Bayern, Platini insisted that that best two teams had reached the final, despite the widely held view that their respective semifinal opponents -- Barcelona and Real Madrid -- are Europe's strongest teams. ""Could be, but the result is there -- it's Bayern Munich against Chelsea. I didn't see Barcelona be better than Chelsea and I didn't see Real Madrid be better than Bayern in these games,"" said the UEFA president. Surprising season . ""Everything was surprising -- the non-qualification of some of the English teams to the second round, the fact that Chelsea and Bayern were not favorites for the semifinals and they beat Barcelona and Real Madrid. It has been incredible year for the legend of the cup."" Next season will be the 20th anniversary of the Champions League, which was formerly known as the European Cup. Asked to single out his favorite finals, Platini picked Liverpool's win over AC Milan 2005 and Barcelona's triumph in 2011. ""Istanbul, was an incredible game for Liverpool against Milan and last year's final between Barcelona and Manchester United was a great, great game with a great atmosphere at the stadium.""","Platini confident German Chancellor Merkel would attend Euro 2012 final if Germany playing .

In fall 1987, Brawley, who is African-American, was found disheveled inside a trash bag with racial slurs written across her body in Wappingers Falls, New York. Brawley, then 15, claimed she was kidnapped and repeatedly raped by a group of white men. In one of his first mainstream cases, activist Al Sharpton became Brawley's spokesman, staging rallies and calling for justice on her behalf. Sharpton fights different 'wars' When the case was brought before a grand jury, it concluded that Brawley had falsified the entire account. Pagones, who was an assistant district attorney, filed a civil suit that named Brawley, Sharpton and Brawley's lawyers as defendants. Sharpton has since paid his debt to Pagones. But Brawley, now 41 and a nurse living in Virginia, still owes Pagones more than $431,000. Pagones says he will forgive the debt if Brawley issues a personal apology and finally clears his name of all wrongdoing. ""Just tell the truth. That's all I'm looking for here. I have been battling this since day one, and it's really all about telling the truth,"" Pagones said. Calls to Brawley were not returned. CNN's Julia Lull contributed to this report.","Tawana Brawley claimed that Steven Pagones and others raped her in 1987 .

"(CNN) -- The renewal over the weekend of an accusation first made more then 20 years ago -- that Woody Allen molested his adopted daughter, Dylan, when she was 7 years old -- has spurred other relatives to line up on one side or the other of the complex family tree. Moses Farrow -- Dylan's brother, also adopted, and now a 36-year-old family therapist -- backed his father and blamed his mother, actress Mia Farrow. ""My mother drummed it into me to hate my father for tearing apart the family and sexually molesting my sister,"" Moses Farrow, 36, told People Magazine. ""And I hated him for her for years. I see now that this was a vengeful way to pay him back for falling in love with Soon-Yi."" He was referring to Soon-Yi Previn, whose relationship with Allen led to the breakup in 1992 of the film director's 12-year relationship with Mia Farrow, who had adopted Soon-Yi with composer Andre Previn. Soon-Yi Previn was 19; Allen was 56. They married in 1997. At the time, Mia Farrow accused Allen of having molested Dylan. The charge triggered a custody battle, with Allen going to court to get custody of both of their adopted children and Satchel, their biological son, who now calls himself Ronan Farrow. A police investigation of the allegations ended without charges against Allen. Ronan Farrow, 26, said in a tweet on Sunday that he backed Dylan Farrow. ""I love and support my sister and I think her words speak for themselves,"" he wrote. Dylan Farrow, now 28, resurrected the charge in a letter published in New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof's blog hours before the Writers Guild Awards ceremony, for which Allen, 78, had been nominated for best screenplay for ""Blue Jasmine."" He did not win. ""What's your favorite Woody Allen movie? Before you answer, you should know: When I was seven years old, Woody Allen took me by the hand and led me into a dim, closet-like attic on the second floor of our house,"" Farrow wrote. ""He told me to lay on my stomach and play with my brother's electric train set. Then he sexually assaulted me."" Kristof also wrote about it in his Sunday column. Moses Farrow said it never happened. ""Of course Woody did not molest my sister,"" he told the magazine, which said he is estranged from Mia Farrow and close to Allen. ""She loved him and looked forward to seeing him when he would visit. She never hid from him until our mother succeeded in creating the atmosphere of fear and hate towards him. The day in question, there were six or seven of us in the house. We were all in public rooms and no one, not my father or sister, was off in any private spaces. My mother was conveniently out shopping. I don't know if my sister really believes she was molested or is trying to please her mother. Pleasing my mother was very powerful motivation because to be on her wrong side was horrible."" Dylan has stuck to her story. ""This is such a betrayal to me and my whole family,"" she told the magazine in response to her brother's comments. ""My memories are the truth and they are mine and I will live with that for the rest of my life."" Allen lawyer Elkan Abramowitz told CNN on Tuesday that the matter was exhaustively investigated and authorities determined that Mia Farrow had coached Dylan Farrow. ""They also determined that the molestation did not happen,"" he said. He told NBC's ""Today"" on Tuesday that Dylan Farrow may have believed she was telling the truth when she leveled the accusation, but that she is acting on false memories implanted by her mother. Not true, Dylan Farrow told People. ""She never planted false memories in my brain. My memories are mine. I remember them. She was distraught when I told her. When I came forward with my story she was hoping against hope that I had made it up. In one of the most heartbreaking conversations I have ever had, she sat me down and asked me if I was telling the truth. She said that Dad said he didn't do anything. And I said, 'He's lying.'"" In turn, Moses Farrow accused his mother of having treated him badly when he was a child, People reported. ""From an early age, my mother demanded obedience and I was often hit as a child,"" he told the magazine. ""She went into unbridled rages if we angered her, which was intimidating at the very least and often horrifying, leaving us not knowing what she would do."" Dylan Farrow disagreed. ""I don't know where he gets this about getting beaten,"" she told the magazine. ""We were sent to our rooms sometimes."" She described Moses Farrow as ""dead to me,"" and praised their mother. ""My mother is so brave and so courageous and taught me what it means to be strong and brave and tell the truth even in the face of these monstrous lies."" Mia Farrow did not respond to a request for comment from CNN. But she tweeted on Tuesday, ""I love my daughter. I will always protect her. A lot of ugliness is going to be aimed at me. But this is not about me, it's about her truth."" Allen's sister, Letty Aronson, told the magazine that the director was devastated by the accusation. ""He feels very badly for Dylan, that she has been so poisoned by her mother."" Dylan Farrow described her family in different terms. ""We are brave and we are truthful and anyone who says anything otherwise does not know us."" Kristof, who described himself as a friend of Mia and Ronan Farrow, said Dylan Farrow is now happily married and living in Florida. CNN's Alan Duke, Chelsea J. Carter, Ralph Ellis, Carolyn Sung, Todd Leopold, Sarah Edwards, Michelle Hall, Nischelle Turner and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","Moses Farrow: ""This was a vengeful way to pay him back for falling in love with Soon-Yi""

"(CNN) -- Astronaut Scott Carpenter, the second American to orbit Earth, died Thursday, NASA said. He was 88. ""We have lost a true pioneer. I shall long remember him not only for his smarts and courage but his incredible humor. He kept us all grounded,"" said NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden. ""We will miss him greatly."" Carpenter was one of the original Mercury 7 astronauts chosen by NASA, which said he died from complications after a stroke. He was a backup pilot for John Glenn ahead of America's first manned orbital space flight in February 1962. Carpenter flew the second American manned orbital flight in May of that year. Flight time was four hours and 54 minutes, according to a NASA biography. Carpenter's spacecraft overshot its landing target by some 250 nautical miles, giving rise to fears about his fate. With Carpenter's death, Glenn is the lone survivor of the Mercury 7, which included Carpenter, Glenn, L. Gordon Cooper, Virgil ""Gus"" Grissom, Walter Schirra, Alan Shepard and Donald ""Deke"" Slayton. Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin was the first person to orbit Earth in April 1961. 'Pioneer' of inner and outer space . Carpenter was born in Boulder, Colorado, and attended the University of Colorado, where he studied aeronautical engineering. He retired from the Navy in 1969, after some two decades of service. Post-NASA, Carpenter explored underwater environments as an aquanaut in the Navy's Man in the Sea Project -- at one point living and working on the ocean floor for 30 days straight. He later served as director of the Navy's aquanaut operations. ""I still can't make up my mind whether I like outer or inner space better,"" Carpenter said last year -- adding with a smile, ""But there's a difference in glory."" Carpenter's memoir, ""For Spacious Skies: The Uncommon Journey of a Mercury Astronaut,"" was published in 2003. He also wrote two novels. ""He was one of the good guys and a good friend, a pioneer who made significant contributions to our country,"" said Dick Gordon, command module pilot for Apollo 12. People we've lost in 2013 .

"(CNN) -- Two members of Force India's Formula One team have left Bahrain after a petrol bomb was thrown at one of the marque's cars during an anti-government protest. A vehicle carrying four members of the F1 team became caught up in a demonstration on their way back to the team's hotel in the capital Manama after leaving the circuit where Sunday's Bahrain Grand Prix will be held. The build-up to the race has been dominated by fears that civil unrest in the Gulf kingdom could have an adverse effect on safety for both teams and fans. Last year's installment was canceled twice but the sport's governing body confirmed on Friday the race would go ahead as planned, despite tension on the country's streets. Bahrain circuit boss: Race not a big risk . Both the Force India team and local organizers -- the Bahrain International Circuit -- were quick to stress the team's vehicle had not been specifically targeted. ""The team was returning from the circuit last night,"" Force India press officer Will Hings told CNN. ""There was some disruption on one of the highways and the vehicle was momentarily brought to a halt in the traffic jam. ""After a few minutes the incident unfolded and our crew returned to the hotel. Nobody was hurt and we were not a target. The incident was happening as we arrived but we were not the target."" Hings confirmed that two team members had returned to the UK after the incident on Wednesday evening -- one who was in the car and one who was not. He added that Force India would continue to take take guidance from Formula One's governing body, the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). F1 chief Ecclestone: Sport and politics should not mix- . Most teams have maintained they are happy to race in Bahrain but one of Force India's drivers, Nico Hulkenberg, was quoted by BBC Sport as saying: ""We shouldn't have been put in this position."" At a demonstration on Monday in Al Dair, in the north east of Bahrain, many pro-democracy protestors carried anti-F1 slogans. More action is expected to be planned around the weekend's event. Bernie Ecclestone, the head of Formula One, has continually insisted that sufficient security measures are in place in Bahrain and that the sport had nothing to do with the politics of the country. A statement from the Bahrain International Circuit confirmed the incident had taken place but underlined that the Force India group had not been singled out for any violence. ""They drove through an isolated incident involving a handful of illegal protestors acting violently towards police,"" it read. ""During this incident a Molotov Cocktail landed in the vicinity of their vehicle. ""After approximately two minutes, the route was cleared and the vehicle carried on its journey. There were no casualties and eyewitness reports from the scene confirmed that their vehicle had not been targeted itself. ""The BIC would like to reiterate its confidence in the relevant Bahrain authorities in their ability to deal with such isolated incidents and can confirm that all the usual precautions are being taken around the track to ensure the level of security is maintained.""","Four members of Force India Formula One team caught up in Bahrain protest .

"Washington (CNN) -- A horse is a horse, of course, of course. That is, of course, unless that dancing horse belongs to the famous Romney family. Sports Illustrated Explainer: What's dressage? Rafalca, the dressage horse co-owned by Ann Romney, the wife of GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney, competed Thursday and will continue competition on Friday at the London Olympics; the horse is in 13th place after Thursday's competition. Ann Romney began riding horses when she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1998 and has said the sport has helped lessen the symptoms of the inflammatory disease. Horserace turns (almost) literal in London . Still, the Romneys' participation in the pricey prancing pony sport is causing conservatives consternation and liberals laughing fits. Both say the fussy filly is yet more proof that Romney, whose net worth is nearly $250 million, is out of touch with average voters. ""It fits into the narrative the Democrats are trying to put forward that he is wealthy and out of touch with the typical America,"" said Donald Gross, a political science professor at the University of Kentucky. The liberal group MoveOn.org pokes fun at the elegant equine in a 30-second television spot set to air in the battleground states of Nevada, Ohio and Pennsylvania and supported by a total ad buy of five figures. Looking a dressage horse in the mouth . The ad is told from the perspective of the horse. ""My name's Rafalca, the Romneys' dressage horse,"" the ad begins. MoveOn.org uses a poorly executed English accent as the voice of the Romneys' horse. ""You might have seen me execute 'leg yields' and 'flying changes,'"" the ad continues, using terms from the sport of dressage. ""How do I pull off such grace and athleticism while looking so good? Maybe it's because the Romneys spend $77,000 per year on my upkeep."" The ad comes to a grim conclusion, stating: ""After Mitt Romney repeals health care and ships your jobs overseas, I daresay your life won't be nearly as pampered as mine. After all, you're not one of his horses."" What Romney could learn from dressage . In mid-July, the Democratic National Committee briefly used video of the Romneys' Olympic-bound horse to portray the candidate as ""dancing around the issues,"" but later discontinued using Rafalca because it could be seen as offensive to the GOP candidate's wife. DNC to stop using Romney horse in attack videos . Such cheap shots reflect ignorance about the sport, said Stephan Hienzsch, executive director of the United States Dressage Federation. ""It's a bit misleading that the sport is as expensive or as elitist as people have made it out to be,"" Hienzsch said. ""It doesn't necessarily reflect on the entire sport."" Still, conservatives are mortified at what they see as the poor political strategy of having a horse participate in something that, according to the United States Dressage Federation, can cost upwards of $50,000 to compete at such a high level. ""I'm not sure why the horse has to be in the most upper-class hoity-toity Olympic event ever invented,"" conservative commentator Charles Krauthammer said on Fox News recently. ""It's unnecessary."" During the campaign, Romney has struggled to shake the image of a disconnected multimillionaire. Comments about NASCAR-owning friends and asides on owning more than one Cadillac certainly don't help matters, political experts say. Romney calls billionaire football team owners friends . In a Quinnipiac University/ CBS News/New York Times swing state poll released this week, more than 50% of voters in the battleground states of Pennsylvania and Ohio said they do not feel Romney ""cares about the needs and problems of people"" like themselves. More than 50% of voters polled in those two states said President Barack Obama cares about their needs and problems. While the candidate and his team are rooting for Team USA, it wouldn't be a bad thing politically if Rafalca fails to medal, said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics. ""This is one of these things where the candidate defers to his spouse even though the entire staff knows it's a bad idea. You don't have to be a political strategist to know this was not a good idea,"" Sabato said of the horse's Olympic debut this week. ""This is no Mr. Ed."" Winning a medal will ensure Romney is the butt of horse jokes for weeks to come. With Friday's dressage competition looming, there's still time to make political hay out of the matter. ""If I were the Romney campaign I'd be hoping the Romney horse finishes fourth,"" said Norman Ornstein, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. ""The audience for dressage is not huge, but if Romney's horse wins the gold medal that's a lot of attention."" CNN's Kevin Liptak and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.","Ann Romney's dressage horse made its Olympic debut Thursday .

"(CNN) -- Threats from al Qaeda operatives in Yemen increased in recent weeks and were a reason Yemen and the United States partnered in drone strikes and counterterrorism operations over the last several days, U.S. officials told CNN. ""There is an increased threat stream,"" said one senior U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. CNN has learned the United States believes there is intelligence potentially indicating specific targets in Yemen, including the U.S. Embassy there. Other possible targets include Westerners, as kidnap victims, and Yemeni government and military installations. Although several officials stressed the U.S. Embassy in Yemen is a constant target for terrorists, one U.S. source familiar with the latest information said at least one threat against the embassy was disrupted recently. A separate U.S. official was not aware of a recent specific threat on that embassy. The rise in threats from al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula -- known as AQAP -- continues, the sources said. The uptick is of particular interest to U.S. officials because it comes after a significant effort last year to disrupt a direct threat to the U.S. Embassy in Yemen, as well as other U.S. embassies, which led to several of them being closed around the world. Since the 2013 disruption and subsequent leaks to the news media about how AQAP communicates, the group has significantly cut back on its electronic communications, making it extremely difficult for authorities to track it, a separate U.S. official said. ""We have much less vision about what they are doing. We're not totally blind, but we are not 20/20. We're not even anywhere near 20/20,"" said the official. Sources emphasized the recent counterterrorism operation had been planned for weeks and was part of a broader effort to disrupt AQAP. At least 65 suspected terrorists were killed in assaults from both the ground and sky in southern Yemen this week. Many suspected al Qaeda militants, who survived the strikes in Abyan province, are fleeing toward Azzan in the south central part of the country, a town that could fall under the control of al Qaeda, according to a senior Yemeni government official. There is a lack of government and army presence in that area, that official said. The two military brigades currently in southern Shabwa province, which includes Azzan, ""can't try to follow those militants on the move and are preoccupied with securing the (liquefied natural gas) facilities,"" the official said. The official added that Yemeni authorities are on high alert and expecting ""imminent retaliatory attacks"" from AQAP.

"New York (CNN) -- A New York man dubbed the ""subway vigilante"" after he shot four youths in 1984 was released from jail Saturday on a charge of selling marijuana to an undercover officer. Bernhard Goetz, 65, was ordered freed on his own recognizance at an arraignment in Criminal Court, the Manhattan district attorney's office said. His next court date is December 18, the district attorney's office said. National attention followed 1984 shooting . Goetz was the subject of national attention when he shot four black teenagers on December 22, 1984, aboard a Manhattan subway car. The four said they were panhandling and asked Goetz for $5 to play video games. Goetz said he believed he was being robbed. Goetz, who is white, was acquitted of murder and assault charges in the shooting but was convicted of illegal possession of a weapon. He served less than nine months behind bars. The incident took place at a time when race relations were strained and crime levels were high in New York City. Arrest followed drug sting .

"Silverstone, England (CNN) -- It has taken over 20 years, but a woman was back on the track in the male-dominated world of Formula One . Unfortunately not for very long. Susie Wolff became the first female since 1992 to take part in an F1 weekend, but after just four laps at Friday's British Grand Prix practice session the 31-year-old Scot had to retire because of an oil pressure problem. ""It was a really tough day,"" a dejected Wolff told reporters at the historic Silverstone circuit, after her stricken car was hoisted back to the pits. ""But that's F1 sometimes. ""Although there has been a lot of media around my run, when it's just you in the car it's the best feeling. ""I felt very ready for today -- I knew in my head what I had to do, it was good to get that first run of a race weekend in the bag."" Wolff's best time of one minute and 44.212 seconds was set at the very start of the session and was not representative of her ultimate pace. Claire Williams -- deputy team principal of her father's eponymous race team and another strong female role model in the sport -- explained the team did not need to judge Wolff's driving abilities during her practice debut. ""That was heartbreaking really,"" said Williams. ""The rest of the team are so disappointed for Susie as she's put in so much effort and hard work and she's been subjected to so much scrutiny. ""It was nothing that she did, it was an issue with the car that we are investigating."" Williams' deputy team principal praised Wolff for her diligence ahead of the session. ""We don't have a question mark over her,"" Williams told the media. ""We're not running her to see how good she is, that's not what we're doing. ""She knows the car, she's done a lot of preparation in the simulator, she's spent a lot of time with the engineers and she's perfectly competent in the car without causing any hindrance to the team. ""She goes out there with her peers in a competitive situation."" Wolff, who competed for six years in the popular German touring car championship before joining F1, has been up against it both on and off the track. As the wife of Mercedes executive director Toto Wolff, who also owns just over 10% of the Williams team, she has had to bat away suggestions that she owes her opportunity behind the wheel to nepotism. ""I've always said he's my biggest supporter and also my biggest critic,"" said Wolff at Silverstone. ""He knew I had to go out there and do a good job today. He's also quite sad that I didn't get the chance to show it. He would have loved it if I'd have done the session and done a good job."" Williams' deputy team principal has also had to deny employing Wolff as the team's development driver was just a publicity stunt. ""It would be naive to say that having a female on board doesn't bring you commercial benefit but everybody knows that Williams is a serious racing team,"" she said. ""We're not only going to do something because it's a marketing gimmick or could bring us in a load of dollars. ""Susie hasn't bought in those dollars and we haven't had any expectation that she would. She has to deliver technically which she's done."" There was also support for Wolff from her British peers at Silverstone -- former world champions Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button. ""She's very, very talented,"" said Mercedes driver Hamilton, who raced against her in his junior career in karting and Formula Renault. ""It's really cool to see her in a Formula One car. ""I didn't race against many girls. Susie was one of the very few, if not the only one, I raced against. We shared a podium together a couple of times."" McLaren's Button added: ""She's already driven in a test this year and went very well. It'll be good to see her on track."" Wolff will get a second chance to make her mark in first practice at the next grand prix in Germany. ""I've still got one more shot at it,"" said the 31-year-old Wolff. ""So, head up high and look forward to Hockenheim. ""I didn't prove or show anything today. I really want to use that opportunity to show what I can do. ""To get into an F1 car is so difficult that you want to maximize it."" Asked why it had taken more than 20 years for a female racer to be given another opportunity in a competitive F1 session, Wolff told CNN: ""Firstly, if there is no role model out there doing it, for all the little girls who come to the tracks and watch on TV, if they don't see a girl on track then they're not inspired to want to do that themselves. ""That then leads to the second problem that there's not enough girls karting or starting at a young age. Interactive: CNN's guide to Silverstone . ""But sometimes in life you just need a chance, and I got that chance with the Williams team -- Frank and Claire gave me that big break."" Williams -- who grew up in motorsport's macho environment -- told CNN: ""I'm always a believer that it's up to individuals to come up and do it and that hasn't happened for whatever reason."" Giovanna Amati was the last woman to drive in the sport when she attempted to qualify for a race in 1992. The Italian was competing in an era of F1 when there were only 26 spots on the grid and more than 30 cars pushing for those places. Amati, driving for the Brabham team, attempted to qualify at three races but was not able to break through with a largely uncompetitive car. Of the seven women to join the F1 world championship, only two have ever qualified to start a race. The most prolific of these was Italian Lella Lombardi, who started 12 grands prix in the 1970s. Lombardi made history while driving with March at a difficult 1975 Spanish Grand Prix, becoming the only woman to register a point-scoring finish in a grand prix. The late Maria de Villota, who died in October last year, also began her F1 career along with Wolff when she was signed as a development driver by the Marussia team in 2012.","Susie Wolff became the first woman in 22 years to take to the track at an F1 grand prix .

"(CNN) -- It's an odd pairing, really, the gadget-obsessed tech giant from Silicon Valley teaming up with hip-hop super producer Dr. Dre and music mogul Jimmy Iovine. But late Thursday, reports surfaced that a $3.2 billion deal was in the works for Apple to scoop up Beats Electronics, the world's most popular maker of headphones and, more recently, the company behind a highly regarded music-streaming service. Neither side has confirmed the deal, though Dre came dangerously close in a new video in which he declared himself ""the first billionaire in hip-hop."" For fans of Apple, Beats, or both, the main question here is obvious: If the reports are true, what will it mean for me, the consumer? Here are some educated guesses. Deal ... or no deal? First of all, analyst James McQuivey, who follows Apple and other tech companies for Forrester Research, isn't convinced that the deal will really go down. ""Given Apple's historical tight-fistedness with the contents of its huge treasure chest, it wouldn't be surprising if the company backed away,"" he said in a blog post. But if it does happen, he speculates that it won't be simply about bringing the successful Beats under the Apple umbrella. Instead, Apple fans may get some new product no one is envisioning yet. ""I'd like to believe that (Apple) would team up with Beats to do something totally amazing and world-changing,"" he said. ""Because we need some world changing much more than we need Apple to return its hard-earned cash to investors in the form of more dividends. ""So even if Apple doesn't buy Beats after all, the fact that the company is shopping encourages some of us to anticipate what it could spend its hard-earned money on next."" Among projects McQuivey envisions are Beats being part of an Apple-created health-and-fitness monitor (considered likely after Nike essentially punted the future of its FuelBand) or providing the audio on a headset to compete with Google Glass. 'Smart' headphones . For audiophiles, the marriage would, in some ways, be an ironic one. Apple, whose iconic earbuds have been knocked for delivering subpar sound, could be joined by Beats headphones, which have received similar criticisms. ""It is a fair assessment, and I lay the blame squarely on executive management,"" said Tyll Hertsens, editor at audio website Inner Fidelity, referring to Beats. ""Their headphones had just way too much bass, as a general rule, and some models were particularly poor performers -- Solo and Solo HD. Build quality has gotten much better though; they're fairly well built headphones."" How Beats headphones changed the audio world . Apple has worked to address quality issues with its earbuds, which had begun going straight into the garbage, or at least storage, at the hands of many new iPod and iPhone customers. When their new-generation EarPods rolled out in 2012, Engadget reviewer Joe Pollicino may not have been damning them, but he certainly offered faint praise. ""The EarPods are possibly the best-sounding set of $29 earbuds you'll be able to find, but at the end of the day, that's not saying much,"" he wrote. Hertsens sees some things changing and something staying the same at an Apple-owned Beats. The well-established brand would remain intact to keep the ""young and/or impressionable"" buyers who are already fans. Meanwhile, Apple could tap into Beats' existing research and development and manufacturing knowhow to develop new products under the Apple name. He pointed to patents Apple has filed for things like biometric and spacial sensors in headsets, saying ""smart headphones"" from Apple could be on the way. ""In other words, Apple has a bunch of cool new ideas about putting sensors in headphones,"" Hertsens said. ""Beats gives them an instantaneous headphone development and manufacturing capability to kickstart the appearance of these new products."" HD downloads . But for all the talk about headphones -- Beats' flagship product and an accessory used with every Apple mobile device -- another potential product may have caught the eye of folks in Cupertino. Beats Music launched in January, riding a wave of music-streaming websites and apps that have begun changing the way millions of people consume music. Pay-by-the-song digital music services like iTunes have been ceding market share to streaming services like Spotify and Pandora, which offer access to millions of songs, often for free. Why everybody is building a Web music service . Revenues for subscription streaming services were up 51% in 2013, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI). Meanwhile digital downloads from services like iTunes fell 2.1%, the industry group said in its annual report. Apple's entry into the market, iTunes Radio, has failed to make much of a dent in the Unites States, where Pandora remains the dominant streaming service. The mobile-oriented Beats Music is just a few months old, but it's gotten high marks for its robust suggestion engine that considers factors as detailed as which songs make the user crank up the volume. Michael Lavorgna, of AudioStream.com, said a major push into streaming could coincide with Apple also offering higher-quality, 24-bit downloads. Direct sales from iTunes could become a more specialized market, wherein users would get the same sound quality they're used to getting by streaming. ""How many people will continue to pay for lossy (low-quality) downloads when they can stream millions of choices in the same quality for the cost of about one album download per month?"" Lavorgna asked rhetorically. ""This potential deal between Apple and Beats could very well spur Apple's move to HD downloads. If this deal happens, its safe to say we'll see a sea change in the market and a move away from lossy downloads. I say it's about damn time.""","Apple is reportedly close to buying headphone maker Beats Electronics .

"(CNN) -- Steven Pienaar will carry the weight of his country's expectations when he represents South Africa on home turf at this summer's World Cup. The midfielder was South Africa's Footballer of the Year in 2009 and plays for English Premier League team Everton. Piennar, 28, tells CNN's Inside Africa about growing up in a tough Johannesburg neighborhood, the responsibilities that go with being a professional footballer, and his hopes for the ""Rainbow Nation,"" and how he doesn't think the World Cup will go to an African team this year. CNN: You grew up in Westbury -- what kind of neighborhood is it? Steven Pienaar: It's famous for bad stuff. A lot of burglars and gangsterism -- and poverty. CNN: What were your options when you were young? What did people want to become at your age at that time? SP: When you're that age growing up in Westbury you look up to the drug dealers, because they are like your heroes. They drive fancy cars, with nice clothes. So you just want to be like them. But I had a strict mom and school was the first thing on my mind. She always wanted me to go to school and just focus on school. And soccer was always after school. CNN: What are your thoughts about the World Cup? SP: We have to go out there and show the world we're not in the World Cup just because we're hosting it. We have to show them we've got a spirit, the African spirit, in us and also the talent and the mentality to win games. And we have to go past the group stages. African football academy creates future stars . CNN: What does it mean to play in front of a local crowd? SP: It's an unbelievable feeling because when you hear the vuvuzela, it's like you're hearing an elephant. You feel that you're in Africa. It's also the noise of people, the excitement of other people when they sing and dance. It's touching. The game means a lot to them and for us playing for the country. It's a special feeling. CNN: Do you feel like you're part of the new South Africa? SP: Yes, I feel I am part of the new South Africa and all that is thanks to [Nelson] Mandela, of course, for changing it. If it wasn't for him, I don't think I would have been given the opportunity. He's changed a lot, and for me to be a famous football player -- I've got a lot of responsibility and I'm going to represent the country. CNN: If you didn't have the talent and determination you have, where would you be if you were back in South Africa? SP: That's a tough one. I'm not sure. I think if I didn't get opportunity to go to a soccer school, I think selling drugs -- something like that. CNN: Tell me more about the passion of Africans for football. Is it almost a religion? SP: It is, because the people hate losing. South Africans are a bunch of impatient people ... and it can make people put guns down just to come watch a game. That's how special the game is. I can't describe the way people are crazy about soccer. CNN: Do you think an African team can win the World Cup? SP: I'm more of a realist. I don't think it will happen in 2010, but it will be something special if an African nation can win it because it's on the continent. I think if it was somewhere in West Africa, with the heat, then you could have said an African nation could win. But in South Africa it will be winter, so it will be more in the favor of the Europeans. Hong Konger turns rugby passion into Rwanda vision . CNN: What has football taught you about life? SP: It can be a roller coaster. I've had a lot of downs in my career but hopefully now it's the turn to go up. But with injuries, that's the down part of it, and being away from your family -- the sacrifices you have to make. You must leave all of your family and friends behind and go away just to get a better living, to make sure your family get a better living. CNN: Do you think African players maybe have more people counting on them than, say, a player from Europe? SP: Definitely. As African players we know we have a big family back home [and if] one of the kids or cousins make it, you have to look after the whole family. You have to work for them. And of course, they're praying for you, for the blessings that you get. So you have to help the whole family to get a better life. CNN: How important is it to the sense of camaraderie that you're representing ""the Rainbow Nation""? SP: It is a rainbow nation and it's a mix of white, mixed race, black players. For us, when we're in camp, we're a family. There's a lot of jokes. We laugh a lot and there's always happiness in the team. The players are always singing and just having fun. That's what you want: A happy home we hope will bring results.","Steven Pienaar was South Africa's Footballer of the Year in 2009 .

"(CNN) -- Mariah Carey's 1997 album ""Butterfly"" holds a number of hits, including the smash singles ""Honey"" and ""My All."" But it's also the album on which Carey tucked an introspective and revealing song called ""Close My Eyes."" The powerhouse vocalist was honored by Broadcast Music, Inc. on September 7 for her songwriting, and she told CNN that the compositions she holds closest typically aren't the songs that became chart-toppers. Instead, her favorites are often lesser-known cuts from more obscure records. She cites ""Underneath The Stars"" from the 1995 album ""Daydream"" as well as ""Looking In"" and ""I Am Free"" from the same album as some of her favorites. Of big No. 1 hits such as ""Touch My Body"" ""We Belong Together"" and ""Hero,"" Carey said: ""I still love those songs,"" but added, ""I love the obscure songs because they're very close to my heart. Especially a song called, 'Close My Eyes' -- that's like my life story."" The down-tempo, piano-backed track paints a picture of a woman with a past -- ""I was a wayward child, with the weight of the world that I held deep inside,"" Carey sings. ""Life was a winding road, and I learned many things little ones shouldn't know."" But, like her new single ""Triumphant (Get 'Em),"" the chorus speaks of courage in the face of adversity: ""But I closed my eyes, steadied my feet on the ground, raised my head to the sky. And though times rolled by, still I feel like a child as I look at the moon. ... Maybe I grew up a little too soon."" While Carey didn't go into detail about the experiences that inspired that song, she did describe what led to the creation of ""Triumphant."" Carey said her husband, Nick Cannon, was going through some health problems around the same time her friend Whitney Houston died. ""There was just so much going on,"" she said. ""It was such an awful time. ... I don't even know how to express what was happening, but I had to express it through music in terms of going the opposite way, almost to encourage myself."" And by encouraging herself, she hoped to encourage others. ""I say, 'Stay triumphant. Keep on living.' That is what I wanted people to hear -- I wanted people who didn't have the strength. ... That's why I'm glad that I put this record out, because that's what it meant to me. And I was also singing what I would want to sing in an encouraging way to my kids."" Carey's twins with Cannon, Monroe and Moroccan, celebrated their first birthday in April. There's a good chance ""Triumphant"" will have the impact Carey's hoping for, as she's heard from fans how her songs have changed their lives. ""This (BMI Icon) award is so amazing because ... this is really about songwriting and there have been many times that people have told me throughout my career that: 'This song has changed my life,' 'This song helped me get through the death of a family member,' "" Carey said.

"(CNN) -- In the end it was the clown who had the last laugh. In 1973, England prepared for a crucial World Cup qualifier against Poland, a team hidden behind the Iron Curtain of communism which had provided little footballing resistance in the recent past. The East Europeans hadn't qualified for an international tournament since before the World War Two. Their players were unknowns, presumed inferior. England, on the other hand, had won the World Cup on the very same Wembley pitch they were about to play on just seven years earlier. It was a team of stars coached by Sir Alf Ramsay. It was to be a cake walk. Such was the mismatch that the iconic English coach Brian Clough dismissed Poland's goalkeeper Jan Tomaszewski as ""a clown."" ""Would you want him in your team every week?"" asked the man who led Nottingham Forest to successive European Cup titles. It was a phrase that followed Clough for the rest of his career. In front of 100,000 England fans, Poland held on to a 1-1 draw. ""The Clown"" had the game of his life and England failed to make it to West Germany 1974. In fact, they wouldn't reach another World Cup for close to a decade. Euro 2012: By the numbers . But for the Poles, the draw was the beginning of a story that saw the national team strut on the international stage for another 13 years, taking them to two third-place World Cup finishes with a group of one of the most talented, and unheralded, groups of players Europe has ever produced. ""I remember everything of this match that opened for Poland the door to the world's football,"" recalls Zbigniew Boniek, the legendary Poland and Juventus forward who watched the match as a 17-year-old aspiring footballer back home. ""I remember every action of the goalkeeper, the anger of the England team that wasn't able to win and the spectacular counterattacks."" Poland's qualification for the 1974 World Cup seemed to come from nowhere. ""Poland hadn't qualified for a World Cup since 1938; they had no recent history,"" explains Jonathan Wilson, author of ""Behind the Curtain,"" a book about football in Eastern Europe. ""They were just another bunch of Eastern Europeans to be beaten. England did have 30 chances, but the draw gave them (Poland) a boost of confidence. That momentum carried them on."" When Poland arrived at the 1974 World Cup, it was loaded with symbolism. It was hosted in West Germany just decades after Poland had been decimated by its Western neighbor during World War Two. While many consider the 1974 World Cup as the great coronation which announced the arrival of the Dutch and Rinus Michel's ""Total Football,"" Poland excelled with equal creativity. Racism overshadows Euro 2012 . While Tomaszewski went from clown to being considered one of the best goalkeepers in Europe, up front the Poles had the legendary Gzegorz Lato. He would go on to score eight goals, winning the Golden Boot along the way. They went all the way to the semifinals against West Germany. Poland lost that game 1-0 in treacherous conditions before winning the third-place playoff against the holders Brazil. ""I can remember one game where I've always maintained we beat a team which was fundamentally better than us. In fact, it was definitely the best team in the competition and still didn't win the World Cup. I mean Poland in 1974,"" the legendary Real Madrid and Germany defender Paul Breitner told FIFA's website. ""They had a better team at that World Cup than Germany, Holland, Brazil, or anyone else for that matter. The Poles had the best team in 1974."" ""It's a way of kicking the Dutch!"" laughs Wilson when asked about Breitner's comments, referencing the fierce footballing rivalry between the Germans and the Dutch. ""The Germans were still worthy winners. But could Poland have won the World Cup? Definitely. The game against West Germany could have gone either way."" Pulling the strings was legendary coach Kazimirez Gorski. Heavily influenced by the tactical revolution taking place in the Netherlands and the Soviet Union, he took Poland to the 1972 Olympics and won gold there, nurturing a fast, counterattacking team and bringing through players like Lato, Kazimierz Deyna and Wlodzimierz Lubanski. ""He seems to have been a very avuncular figure, a real father figure,"" explains Wilson. ""He actually involved them in the decision-making process. ""Communism needed a vigorous hierarchy, you couldn't questions things or speak spontaneously. But Gorski encouraged that, the balance of authority and respecting views."" One player who was brought into the Poland team by Gorski was Boniek. It was one of his final acts as coach. ""He is the symbol of Poland,"" Boniek told CNN. ""He was the first coach that made us believe (we coul)] rise to world levels. He was a hero and now that he's gone he has become a legend."" The 1978 World Cup in Argentina will always be tainted with the accusations of corruption leveled at the ruling Junta. Boniek too felt that Poland's cause wasn't helped by having to play the hosts. ""The Poland team of 1978 was the greatest Polish team of all time,"" he believes. ""(But) we ended up politically in a very difficult ground. Argentina played at home and for that reason it was very protected."" After a strong start, topping a group ahead of West Germany, Poland headed into the second pool phase where Argentina thrashed Peru 6-0. At the 1978 World Cup, the two top teams in each group contested the final and that controversial result, coupled with losses against the hosts and later Brazil, made it impossible for Poland to qualify. Yet the team bounced back for the 1982 World Cup in Spain where Boniek made his name, scoring a hat-trick against Belgium. Poland again finished third at what is today regarded as one of the greatest World Cups of all time. ""Let's say that the match against Belgium is my business card,"" says Boniek. ""We were compact, a great group. There weren't those champions of '74 and '78 but we played great football."" It was more than just football that was changing in Poland. The late 1970s and early 1980s saw the emergence of Lech Walesa, a Polish dock worker whose Solidarity trade union movement would rise from the Gdansk shipyards on the Baltic Sea and strike the first nail into communism's coffin. ""Communism had a great impact on the football,"" explains Michal Zachodny, a Polish football journalist and prominent blogger. ""Look at each (local) club and every single one of them was supported by a factory, local branch (of the Communist Party), police, army. It was very influential. It (football) was almost a fight between the authorities."" ""The communist regime always wanted to put its face on every sporting success,"" recalls Boniek. ""But we wanted to play football and so we weren't interested in this."" As communism's grip loosened in Poland, the national football team began to fade. Boniek's Poland did qualify fora fourth consecutive World Cup at Mexico in 1986 but lost heavily to England before being beaten convincingly by Brazil 4-1. They would not make another World Cup for 16 years. But their grace on the international stage during two golden generations of players will never be forgotten in Poland. In fact, for some like Zachodny it is not forgotten too often. ""The heroes of past years are remembered well,"" he says. ""Still the Polish media are matching the current squad, club teams and individuals to the ones that have graced the pitch 30, 40 years ago ... there is a spirit of the '70s and '80s that allows us to recall the glory and link to it at every occasion. Poles do that very often, believe me!"" But now Poland is preparing to host its first major international tournament since the fall of communism. For the Poles, Euro 2012 is something of a coming of age party, a chance to show the world it has moved on from its communist past. ""Poland is not becoming a leading European nation,"" says Boniek. ""Poland already is a (leading) European nation, 100%. For some aspects it could be a model for other nations."" All that has been missing has been a football team to match Poland's incredible political and economic growth of the past two decades. And maybe even the perpetually skeptical Poles have reason to hope. Whereas some of the last crop of top players decided to play for Germany rather than Poland -- such as Miroslav Klose and Lukas Podolski -- in Borussia Dortmund's striker Robert Lewandowski and captain Jakub ""Kuba"" Blaszczykowski the country has two players that would grace any team at the Euros. ""In the past Poland's football team was stronger, maybe because life for children is different. And also because they don't have the same tenacity that we had in the past,"" says Boniek. ""But in the end (to) win against Poland at home will be always very difficult."" When the Poland national team walk out on to the pitch at their stunning new national stadium in Warsaw on Friday, they will walk with the ghosts of the past in more ways than one.","Poland are co-hosting Euro 2012 and are keen to show they are a leading European democracy .
Their current football team is at a low ebb but they enjoyed a golden spell during the 1970s and 80s .
In 1974 their derided team gained a draw with England that sent them to the World Cup .

"Washington (CNN) -- A liberal advocacy group is blaming Republicans for the Ebola crisis in a new ad that will first air on TV in Kentucky next weekend. The Agenda Project released an ad online late Sunday that interlaces self-described ""disturbing footages of the Ebola outbreak"" with a mash-up of top Republicans -- including those tied up in crucial midterm contests and potential 2016 candidates -- saying the word ""cut."" The ad describes how the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention saw its discretionary funding cut by $585 million from 2010 to 2014 and the National Institute for Health has faced $446 million in cuts during the same period. The group plans to continue to play up public fears over the Ebola virus in the final weeks leading up to the midterms and will modify the ad with state-specific versions to hit Republican Senate candidates like Iowa's Joni Ernst and North Carolina's Thom Tillis who want to cut federal government spending, the group's founder and president Erica Payne said. Payne called the ad an ""indictment"" of Republican policies that have ""led directly to thousands of deaths overseas"" and said the ad is not ""sensationalized"" or ""aggressive."" ""People should be deathly afraid of Republican policies,"" Payne said in an interview Monday, adding that the link between the Ebola crisis and the Republican focus on cutting government spending is ""really straightforward."" Complete coverage of the Ebola outbreak . Responding to the ad, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee said the best way to fix the federal government is to remove ""Democrats from the driver's seat in the Senate."" ""It's odd in that the Democrats blaming Washington for Ebola have controlled Washington for the last six years,"" he said. Both the CDC and NIH were impacted by the sequester, across-the-board spending cuts that went into effect in 2013 when Republicans and Democrats in Congress could not come to an agreement on specific cuts that would offset the automatic slashing. The ad, ""Republican Cuts Kill,"" ties Republicans to the Ebola outbreak, which has killed more than 4,000 people in West Africa, but only one person in the United States. Payne said that there's ""no question"" that the Ebola death on U.S. soil would not have happened if Republicans weren't so focused on cutting government spending. ""These people's anti-government fever has reached such a level that it is damaging to our country's ability to deal with this kind of issue,"" Payne said. ""We're here because of them."" The ad, which the group said will make its debut on Kentucky airwaves this weekend, opens with a clip of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who would likely become majority leader if Republicans take back the Senate next month. ""Washington actually can cut spending,"" McConnell says at the start of the ad. McConnell isn't the only Senate contender featured in the ad. Reps. Bill Cassidy and Tom Cotton, who are vying to unseat the Democratic incumbent in Louisiana and Arkansas, respectively, also pop up in the spot. Ebola becomes an election issue . Pat Roberts, the senator from Kansas who is facing independent businessman Greg Orman, also flashes across the screen. The group plans to expand the ad to high airwaves in Senate races in South Dakota, North Carolina, Iowa and Kansas, Payne said. And the liberal group also attacks potential 2016 presidential contenders, with Govs. Rick Perry and Chris Christie, Sens. Rand Paul and Marco Rubio as well as Reps. Paul Ryan and Michele Bachmann making an appearance alongside clips documenting the Ebola outbreak. Paul's spokesman, Brian Darling, blasted the Agenda Project for being ""a shadowy group of progressive political hit men"" and said they ""should be ashamed of themselves for blaming a whole political party for the Ebola virus."" The organization itself is no stranger to controversy having been behind the 2011 ad that appears to show Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) pushing an elderly woman in an wheelchair off a cliff. The ad isn't the first time midterm politics have gotten an injection of Ebola. Republican candidate for Senate in New Hampshire Scott Brown also used the deadly disease to attack incumbent Sen. Jeanne Shaheen for not securing the U.S.'s southern border. GOP stokes border fears over Ebola, ISIS . Tillis also said the U.S. should tighten border security to prevent an Ebola outbreak in the U.S. in a debate last week against Sen. Kay Hagan. Arkansas Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor also made Ebola the focus of an ad attacking his challenger, Rep. Tom Cotton, for voting against a pandemic preparedeness bill. (Cotton actually voted for the final version of the bill.) Sen. Bob Casey, a Pennsylvania Democrat, said Monday on CNN the public health system needs more resources to confront Ebola and that Congress should have never cut public health funding over the last several years. ""Especially when it comes to public health, sequestration is a bad idea and should be repealed,"" Casey said. ""Congress has to take responsibility for a program that needs a lot more funding."" Democratic senator can't judge Obama's Ebola handling . Congress will debate and vote on the budget for the next fiscal year in the coming weeks, which Casey called ""an opportunity in the Congress to get this right."" He is calling for adding at least $120 million to the public health budget. Rep. Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat from Maryland, also linked spending cuts and the Ebola outbreak in an interview with CNN on Thursday. ""There's no doubt the deep health care cuts that we've seen have made it more difficult to respond in a rapid and comprehensive way to the Ebola outbreak,"" Van Hollen said. ""The cuts they've seen in past years, they were like eroding the foundation and it clearly meant that they were starting from behind,"" And Anthony Fauci, director of the NIH's National Insitutte of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said during a recent Congressional hearing that spending cuts have had ""a significant impact on us"" that has ""eroded our ability to respond in the way that I and my colleagues would like to see us be able to respond to these emerging threats."" Ashley Killough contributed to this report.","The liberal advocacy group mixes footage of the Ebola outbreak with Republicans saying the word ""cut"".

"(CNN) -- The heatwave may have passed at the Australian Open but in its place came shockwaves as women's title favourite Serena Williams crashed out. The American world No.1 melted under pressure from resurgent Serbian Ana Ivanovic in the fourth round Sunday. Williams, who was chasing a sixth Australian Open crown and an 18th career grand slam, blamed the shock 6-4 3-6 3-6 defeat on an error-strewn display. ""I made a tremendous amount of errors, shots I missed I normally don't miss, I haven't missed since the Eighties,"" Williams told reporters. ""I'm just not used to missing those shots. ""I just made way, way, a lot of unforced errors. ""I know for a fact I can play so much better than what I did today, so with that, knowing that, I'm not disappointed or anything. I just know that I can play ten times better."" Williams refused to blame a back injury for her defeat although the 32-year-old did reveal that she had considered quitting the opening grand slam of the year before her match against Ivanovic. ""I almost pulled out,"" explained Williams, who last lost a match in August. ""I'm such a competitor. I mean, I probably should have. ""Maybe I wasn't the best physically, but that had nothing to do with it. I don't want to blame anything. ""I feel like Ana deserves all the credit. I feel she played unbelievable today. "" Victory for Ivanovic is a major boost for the 2008 French Open champion who is trying to get her career back on track after several seasons plagued by big-match nerves, serving troubles and a series of injuries. The 26-year-old told CNN's Open Court last month that she had effectively pressed the re-set button ahead of the 2014 season, swapping British coach Nigel Sears for new coach and hitting partner Nemanja Kontic. ""I've been working really hard,"" said Ivanovic, who last reached a grand slam quarterfinal at the 2012 U.S Open. ""I have a new team with me since Wimbledon and it's a Serbian team for me for the first time."" The restructure appears to be working as Ivanovic won a warm-up tournament in Auckland -- incidentally beating Venus Williams -- before notching up her first-ever win over Williams' younger sister Serena. Asked by reporters in Melbourne what the difference was between this match and her previous encounters with Williams, she said: ""Well, I actually believed. I had some confidence coming into today's match. ""This victory means so much to me. All the hard work, it's paying off. ""I had very tough fourth round matches in a grand slam, and this was probably the toughest of tough. I just went out there to play. I had nothing to lose. ""To have that victory, you know, it's amazing. We all know what kind of champion she is.""

"(CNN) -- Some of Europe's best footballers will be missing in Poland and Ukraine this month, as the effects of another grueling season takes its toll. The English Premier League, the only one of the continent's major divisions not to have a winter break, is particularly brutal in its demands on players, with research by UEFA indicating that EPL stars are four times more likely to be injured in the last three months of the campaign than those elsewhere. With so many matches being played -- and at such physical intensity -- perhaps player burnout is inevitable before a major championship such as Euro 2012 even starts. But is it? What if coaches and medical staff had a way of tracking players' fitness, allowing them to be rested before injury occurs? One leading sports scientist, Dr. Craig Duncan, has come to the conclusion that soft-tissue injuries -- such as those suffered by England's Frank Lampard and Gareth Barry -- can be prevented if players wear global positioning systems (GPS) during matches. A satellite-based positioning system owned by the US Department of Defense, GPS can measure how intensely players are working by tracking their position on the field. A study of two international rugby union players, which was published in 2011, concluded that ""GPS data provides important performance indicators, assists in the development of conditioning and training protocols, as well as injury management."" In Australia, where Duncan is based, the tool is permitted in rugby league and rugby union as well as Australian Rules football. However, according to football's ruling body FIFA, ""GPS systems are not a part of the players' basic equipment"" -- even though the system is used by clubs and international teams in training. However, arguably it might be in FIFA's financial interest to permit the use of GPS given that it recently committed $75 million to an insurance policy to pay clubs a maximum annual payout of $9.7 million per player injured while on national team duty, with clubs paid a daily maximum of $27,000 a player. ""Football needs to legalize its use to enhance player welfare,"" Duncan, who is head of human performance at soccer club Sydney FC, told CNN. ""It's in the interest of clubs, fans, players and the game itself that we do everything possible to maximize the performance of the player while doing our best to minimize the risk of injury."" Half the size of a mobile phone, a GPS unit can be comfortably worn on the upper back by players. Duncan wants FIFA to allow the use of GPS to enable managers to track how their players are coping -- and if they are working too hard, to replace them. ""We have substituted players in preseason when these numbers start getting outside normal zones and also to monitor loads in training to ensure injuries are prevented,"" said the Australian. Duncan believes GPS has played an important role in significantly reducing injuries at Sydney FC. ""As with any prevention initiatives it's hard to say how much we have prevented but I will say we have reduced injury rates at my club by over 60% this year due to careful monitoring. ""If we could use it in games I do think we could prevent more as many injuries are fatigue related. However I also realize many managers would not make subs based on this."" His fears are backed up by the head of fitness and conditioning at English club Liverpool. Darren Burgess -- another Australian -- remains unconvinced by Duncan's argument, insisting that analysis systems such as Prozone provide more than enough data during the week to measure players' workload. ""I'm not sure you would ever get to the stage where a coach would make a substitution based on a player's workload -- and I'm in the coach's camp on that one,"" said Burgess. He also believes here could also be reliability problems with GPS because major stadiums like Anfield might interfere with the satellite signal. Question marks have also been raised about GPS accuracy and variability, but Duncan insists that if you are aware of the error range and it is consistent, you will be able to know when a player is outside their desired limits . ""I have used it in a number of stadiums without issue and it is used every week in Aussie rules, rugby union and rugby league,"" he said. Exercise physiologist Raymond Verheijen, who is working with the Russia national team during Euro 2012, believes as many as 80% of injuries are preventable. He has long argued that fatigue due to overtraining is the cause. The Dutchman recently published a study demonstrating that teams playing every three days are substantially disadvantaged by player fatigue. The study, which looked at 27,000 matches, showed that teams playing after just two days' recovery against opponents who had enjoyed at least a three-day gap were found to be 39% less likely to win at home and 42% less likely to win away. Where both teams had just two days' rest, the away team suffered more, showing a 26% reduced likelihood of victory. The FIFA insurance program starts after the European Championship in Poland and Ukraine, with UEFA providing insurance for the 16-team event and all national team matches involving players who play in Europe until September 1. Part of Duncan's reasoning is based on his belief that not enough money is being spent on protecting on a club and country's most valuable assets -- the players. ""I've seen estimates that the total English Premier League wage bill is $2 billion and I would say less than 1% of that is spent on maintenance of these players through the use of sports medicine and sport science,"" Duncan told CNN. ""It's just not good business. People spend a greater percentage on maintaining a $30,000 car but for some reason commonsense thinking is removed in professional sport."" British company Optima-Life is working with the Firstbeat Technologies -- a Finnish firm that has developed a heart-rate analysis product. Optima-Life's chief executive Simon Shepard says stressed footballers need to get away from thinking just about training and then playing matches. ""There is a real area of excitement that people are starting to understand the multiple demands of being an athlete,"" said Shepard. ""It's not just about the training that you do for 20 hours a week. What is the player doing for the other 148 hours of the week? How are they coping with the demands of travel, media and social relationships? ""So sports teams have the challenge of making sure that athletes take ownership of looking after themselves for 24 hours a day. ""In fact that is not just true of sports people, it also applies to business people."" Although FIFA rules do not permit the use of GPS, a spokesman for the world governing body did point out that on page 65 of the laws of the game it states: ""A player may use equipment other than the basic equipment provided that its sole purpose is to protect him physically and it poses no danger to him or any other player. ""All items of clothing or equipment other than the basic equipment must be inspected by the referee and determined not to be dangerous."" Theoretically that might allow clubs or national federations the scope to request that FIFA allows players to use GPS in a game -- and arguably navigate a route to injury prevention.","FIFA rules do not allow the use of GPS during football matches .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Furniture made infamous by crime scene photos shown in the trial of Michael Jackson's doctor go on the auction block in Beverly Hills Saturday. The table where Jackson's sedatives sat and the rug on which paramedics tried to revive him are among more than 500 pieces of fine art and home furnishings that filled Jackson's rented mansion, the house where he died on June 25, 2009. Julien's Auctions has been careful not to call it a Michael Jackson auction out of legal and public relations concerns, instead marketing it as by the mansion's now-famous address -- 100 North Carolwood Drive. Jackson did not own the beds, chairs, clocks, paintings, dishes and other items, but their value may skyrocket because of the personal touch added by the pop icon and his children in the months before he died. Without the connection to Jackson, the property might bring $400,000, Nolan said. But with it ""the sky's the limit,"" Julien's Executive Director Martin Nolan said. A chalkboard left behind in Jackson's kitchen may have cost a few hundred dollars, but what his children wrote on it makes it a very valuable object, Nolan said. The note, handwritten on the black board attached to a 26-inch-tall ceramic rooster, reads ""love Daddy/ I (heart) Daddy/ Smile it's for free."" It sat in the kitchen where, according to testimony in the trial of Dr. Conrad Murray, Jackson would eat lunch each day with Prince, Paris and Blanket Jackson. It was not known which child wrote the chalk note, but Nolan said his research suggested it was from Paris, who was 11 when her father died. Another striking piece is Victorian revival style armoire from the Jackson's master bedroom. On the mirror, presumably where Jackson looked each day as he dressed, is a handwritten message of inspiration: ""Train, perfection March April Full out May."" The wax-pencil note is significant, considering that Jackson was battling the calendar as he prepared for his ""This Is It"" concerts set to premiere in London in July 2009. Dr. Conrad Murray's defense lawyers argued during the trial that the intense pressure on Jackson to rehearse for the 50 shows put him in a desperate fight for sleep, which led to Dr. Murray administering the surgical anesthetic propofol nearly every night in the last two months of his life. Julien's Auctions backed away from selling the bed in which Jackson received the fatal dose of the propofol after a personal request from his mother, Katherine Jackson, Julien's Executive Director Martin Nolan said. The auction house's recreation of the bedroom where Jackson died -- euphemistically called ""the medicine room"" by the company -- features a bed-sized memorial covered with love notes from Jackson fans instead of the death bed. The nightstand seen next to the death bed in coroner's photos, bearing numerous bottles of sedatives and other drugs, is for sale. the ""French occasional table"" is listed for between $300 and $500. The room-size oriental rug that covered the floor where Jackson was placed when paramedics tried to revive him is listed in the auction catalogue for between $400 and $600. The couch and chairs where Jackson likely sat with show producers worried about his health in the days before his death are for sale. One chair in Jackson's bedroom has a stain which Nolan suggested was make up spilled by the star as he sat in front of a mirror. None of Jackson's relatives have expressed an interest in any of the items, Nolan said. He pointed out that they had a chance to take whatever they wanted from the house in the months after his death. The notes and posters brought to the auction house by Jackson fans and placed on the ""medicine room"" memorial will be sent to Jackson's mother and children, he said. Jackson's relationship with Julien's turned sour in the last months of his life when he filed a lawsuit to stop the sale of furnishings from his Neverland ranch. The singer sued the auction company, claiming he did not authorize the sale of items that were removed from Neverland after he sold the ranch. The suit was settled in April 2009 when Julien's canceled the auction and later returned the items to Jackson.","Auction includes a chalkboard love note from Jackson's children .

"(CNN) -- Once upon a time there was a galaxy of stars which burned bright in the ""Big Apple"", a trio of world champions who played football from another planet and sparked a U.S. love affair with the beautiful game. The star-spangled North American Soccer League (NASL) and the New York Cosmos, for a brief time, helped football take off on the other side of the Atlantic. Pele, widely regarded as the finest footballer of all time, his fellow Brazilian Carlos Alberto and German great Franz Beckenbauer formed the formidable spine of the New York Cosmos -- the most-celebrated team in U.S. soccer history. ""Before joining the Cosmos I was playing for Flamengo in Brazil,"" Carlos Alberto, who left Flamengo to join the Cosmos in 1977, told CNN. ""We'd read in the newspaper everyday how successful football was in New York. ""Every game they broke records for people at the game, 75,000, 77,000, 78,000... I thought, I can't miss out on this!"" A crowd of 73,064 watched on at Giants Stadium as the Cosmos beat the Seattle Sounders in August 1978 to win a second consecutive Soccer Bowl, the NASL's championship match. But by 1984, the team built around Pele, Carlos Alberto and Beckenbauer, along with the NASL, had sunk into a blackhole of obscurity. ""The Cosmos means a lot to me,"" reflected Carlos Alberto, who played 100 times for the club in two separate spells. ""I had great moments during the six years I was in New York. We contributed a lot to bringing football, soccer to the States. ""I loved New York. My dream today is to see the new New York Cosmos come back and be a great success."" His dream could be about to come true. After nearly three decades in the dark, the fabled name of the Cosmos is staging a reawakening in the city that never sleeps. This week Pele stood alongside the Cosmos' latest Brazil-born star Marcos Senna to turn the top of the Empire State Building green and announce the club's return to competitive action. An August 3 fixture against the Fort Lauderdale Strikers in a relaunched NASL will be the Cosmos' first league fixture since September 15, 1984. The latest incarnation of the NASL is an eight-team competition, which is unrelated to the U.S.'s current leading football competition Major League Soccer (MLS). ""I think the potential is enormous,"" the Cosmos' COO Erik Stover told CNN. ""Everybody remembers the Cosmos and everybody has a story about it. We certainly have the potential to do that again."" The club was refounded in 2010 and a host of former stars have aligned to boost the returning team's profile. The Cosmos are once again competing in the NASL, which has been up and running as an eight-team league since 2011. The league has the enviable task of matching MLS, which was established as part of the U.S.'s successful bid to host the 1994 World Cup and has housed star names like David Beckham and Thierry Henry. Stover knows more than most about creating a New York soccer success stories. For three years the Pennsylvanian worked at the city's biggest Major League Soccer (MLS) franchise the New York Red Bulls, helping the club move into the purpose-built, 25,000-seater Red Bull Arena. He plans to repeat the trick for the Cosmos with plans already in place for a $400m stadium complex in Belmont Park area. Stover also played a part in bringing Thierry Henry, a world and European champion with France, to the States from Barcelona in 2010. While the Cosmos' history is littered with stellar names, the modern-day team are starting from humble beginnings -- namely the Matchroom Stadium in London. It is home to third-tier English club Leyton Orient and the venue for a key exhibition match for coach Giovanni Savarese's newly-built team. The Cosmos lost 2-1. ""We're very careful to say this is not 1977, this is not 77,000 at Giants Stadium, we don't have Pele and Beckenbauer,"" Stover replies when asked about the task he faces in trying to live up to the Cosmos' stellar past. ""We have a good squad and we play good soccer and we will grow from there. It needs to be built up, we can't start at that level overnight."" But the Cosmos have been able to recruit one player whose caliber is undeniable. Senna enjoyed a successful career in Europe with Spanish club Villarreal, helping the team reach the 2006 Champions League semifinals. The midfielder also represented his adopted homeland at international level and he was a key member of the Spain team which won Euro 2008 and kick started La Roja's recent period of dominance. The Cosmos' legacy is built on the recruitment of players like Senna and Pele, but Stover has more realistic goals this time around. ""Marcos is obviously a great player and a recognizable star,"" he explains. ""I think that's the type of player we're looking for. ""We also know that we have to have a sustainable model. We can't over spend, we can't bring in 11 superstars right now, that's not going to do anybody any good. We like our roster now and we like who we are, every team is always evolving."" Carlos Mendes is one of Senna's new teammates and a genuine New Yorker. The defender boasts a respectable pedigree within U.S. soccer and is a veteran of six years with the Red Bulls. Despite the weight of history on his new team's shoulders, Mendes is relishing the chance to represent a club with such an illustrious name. ""It's an honor,"" insists the 32-year-old. ""We can never duplicate that. You're never going to match that team, some of the best players in the world. ""Hopefully we can play attractive soccer, something the fans can be proud of and we can bring some championships back to New York. That's our main focus starting August 3."" Mendes is part of a team which has been brought together in little over two months by the Cosmos' hierarchy, with coach Savarese at the heart of the effort. The Venezuelan was a journeyman striker in the MLS, best known for a prolific two-year spell with the New York/New Jersey Metrostars between 1996 and 1998. He has a team at his disposal which boasts a European champion, but also contains players looking for a second chance at a football career. ""We are very satisfied with what we're building right now, with the players and the family we're creating at the New York Cosmos,"" says the former Venezuela international. ""I'm having fun. I think this is a great job, with a great organization with a great name. We don't have time to think about pressure, we just have to keep working and make sure we build a new future."" What the future holds for the Cosmos is uncertain. Could the club one day join the Red Bulls in the MLS? ""It's possible,"" answers Stover. ""We don't know. There are no discussions right now. There's no animosity between the groups. ""We just do things one way and MLS does them differently. You never know how things will grow and change over time."" After 30 years in the doldrums, the New York Cosmos are happy enough just being back on the field.","The New York Cosmos return for the first time in 30 years on Saturday .

"TBILISI, Georgia (CNN)  -- The number of people displaced by the warfare in Georgia is approaching 100,000 and the figure could rise, the U.N. refugee agency said Monday. Thousands of people have been displaced by the worsening conflict in the region. International agencies and nations were working to help thousands of people fleeing violence in war-ravaged Georgia, where 275,000 previously displaced people, refugees, stateless people and returnees had been living even before hostilities broke out last week between Georgia and Russia. ""It's a very fluid situation,"" said Ron Redmond, a spokesman for the U.N. high commissioner for refugees. Georgia proper is a particular problem because some of the people who fled to Gori in Georgia from South Ossetia when the conflict began found themselves in a conflict zone and had to go somewhere else. The numbers Redmond cited were as of Sunday. He said about 56,000 people have fled in and around Gori. Many displaced people are headed to Tbilisi, where people are staying with relatives and acquaintances or at facilities available for the displaced.  Watch U.S. and Russia clash » . The UNHCR said in a written statement that Georgian officials believe ""a few thousand have fled south into Georgia proper from South Ossetia, but a registration must be carried out to get an exact figure."" When UNHCR and World Food Program officials traveled to Gori on Sunday, they determined about 80 percent of residents had left the city, which appeared largely deserted. About 30,000 people from South Ossetia headed to North Ossetia in Russia, Redmond said, citing Russian numbers. He said many women and children are showing up without husbands and fathers, indicating many families have been separated. Many of the uprooted are ""extremely distressed,"" he said. They are staying in schools and other public buildings. Those in schools will have to leave by September and ""there's some concern about where they are going to."" ""It's assumed that many will probably go back"" to South Ossetia, Redmond said. At the same time, he said, ""There's been heavy destruction. Many may not have anything to go back to."" Redmond said more displacement is possible because hostilities are continuing in the area. The World Food Program is providing food assistance to displaced people. It said the aid work is perilous because of what the agency says are ""continuing Russian air raids."" Over the weekend, the agency ""provided a 10-day food ration to more than 1,900 displaced people living in shelters"" in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, and said more distributions were taking place Monday. ""The number of people in need of our help is rising by the hour,"" said Lola Castro, director of the WFP for Georgia. She said around 2,750 displaced people had been registered in Tbilisi, and others ""were living with relatives or in unofficial shelters."" UNHCR is working to help civilians fleeing the war zone in and near the disputed region of South Ossetia, where Russian and Georgian troops have been fighting, and is providing humanitarian relief. Over the weekend, the UNHCR and associates passed along aid to ""300 vulnerable Georgians from South Ossetia who had been transferred from Gori to Tbilisi."" ""The agency also provided tents and other supplies to partners in Gori for use by the displaced, if necessary,"" the UNHCR said. The UNHCR said it is starting an ""emergency airlift of relief supplies to bolster its stockpiles of humanitarian aid in the Caucasus region."" High Commissioner Antonio Guterres authorized $2 million from UNHCR's emergency reserve for ""possible immediate new needs in the region"" and said more staff is being deployed. The first airlift flight is to tote 20,000 blankets and other aid items from UNHCR's central emergency stockpile in Dubai to Georgia overnight Monday. Another flight is planned for Wednesday from Copenhagen, Denmark. There will be humanitarian supplies for up to 30,000 people in both flights. The UNHCR is planning to provide ""basic non-food aid items and temporary shelter where required, and has already activated the replenishment of stocks from its central emergency stockpile."" ""Our main concern as the U.N. refugee agency is with the safety of the civilians, both displaced and non-displaced, and with humanitarian access with the possibility for us to help those in distress, especially the uprooted,"" said Antonio Guterres, the U.N. high commissioner for refugees. ""We have mobilized our financial resources and our humanitarian resources. Airlifts are starting with relief items to be able to help people. But we need to be able to get to them."" Guterres said he was pleased with the news that ""humanitarian corridors"" will be established and said UNHCR is ""ready to provide immediate humanitarian support to Georgian or Russian authorities."" Both Russia and Georgia mentioned plans for such corridors -- one to North Ossetia in Russia and one to Georgia. The ICRC said a surgical team will be arriving in Georgia on Tuesday ""to reinforce local surgical staff, in particular those working at Gori's civilian hospital. The Norwegian Red Cross is sending a field hospital to help treat people who have been wounded in Georgia."" That would include those in the South Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali. ""Over the past few days the ICRC has been able to visit hospitals in Alaguir, Ardon and Vladikavkaz, in the Russian Federation, and in Gori, Poti and Senaki in Georgia,"" said Dominik Stillhart, the organization's deputy director of operations. ""It's still too early to say how many people have been killed or injured by the fighting, but our visits to these hospitals confirm that local medical facilities are dealing with a large number of wounded and dead."" The ICRC is hoping to distribute blankets, hygiene materials and cooking pots, and restore access to drinking water in Tskhinvali. The group plans to work with the Russian Red Cross in North Ossetia and provide emergency aid for families. The group is preparing to airlift 15 tons of medicines and medical supplies to treat injured people. The ICRC plans to send material ""for a water-treatment plant and distribution tanks capable of holding safe drinking water for around 20,000 people.""

"(CNN) -- Victor Cruz had no idea what he would say to a family dealing with unthinkable grief. He just knew he had to be there. That, on this emotional day, was enough. The star New York Giants receiver drove to Newtown, Connecticut, this week to meet with the family of Jack Pinto, one of the 20 children killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre. The 6-year-old boy had been buried a day earlier, wearing the No. 80 jersey of his favorite football player. Cruz didn't have any speech prepared. He came to deliver a pair of cleats he had worn two days earlier when the Giants lost to the Atlanta Falcons -- he had scrawled the words ""Jack Pinto, My Hero"" on one and ""R.I.P. Jack Pinto"" on the other -- but mostly he was there to offer support. He listened to the family talk about Jack, sitting in the same chair where the boy's father watched the Giants beat the Patriots in the Super Bowl 10 months earlier. He played the Madden football video game with the kids, quickly discovering that being there was more important than anything he could say. ""I was a little nervous,"" Cruz said. ""I just didn't know how I was going to be received. You never know, when they're going through something like that, how it's going to go down. Once I got there and I saw all the kids there with my jersey on, the family ... the family was outside, and they were still pretty emotional, crying. I saw how affected they were by just my presence alone."" We hear a lot about the ""power of sports,"" and usually, that phrase is little more than a clichÃ©. But as 2012 comes to a close, there were plenty of examples of athletes using their popularity and influence to make a difference in their communities and beyond. Strangers inspired to honor Newtown victims . There were the New York Mets players, past and present, who rallied around a team employee named Shannon Forde. The media relations director and young mother was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer, so the team organized a massive charity dinner and auction. Up for bids: pitching lessons with former Cy Young Award winners Dwight Gooden, Johan Santana and R.A. Dickey; hitting lessons from Mets third baseman David Wright; and signed bats from Yankee stars Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez. There was the story of the New York marathon, canceled in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. With nowhere to run, thousands of athletes instead spent the weekend in the hardest-hit areas, unloading supplies at shelters or helping to clean up wrecked homes. Some had seen a lifelong dream washed away but instead accomplished something even more fulfilling. There were the Indianapolis Colts players and cheerleaders who shaved their heads to support cancer research. The team's head coach, Chuck Pagano, was forced to leave the team after he was diagnosed with leukemia. In the months that followed, the team raised more than $250,000, and several local businesses also held successful fundraisers. And then there was the support after the Newtown tragedy. Tennessee Titans running back Chris Johnson wrote the names of all 20 young victims on his cleats and then scored on a 94-yard touchdown run. Jeter, the iconic Yankees shortstop, called the family of teacher Victoria Soto, who hid her students in a bathroom and died trying to protect them from shooter Adam Lanza. Simple gestures like these can't make the pain go away. But Giants head coach Tom Coughlin might have summed up their potential impact the best when he talked to Cruz about his trip to Newtown: ""That family will remember that all their days. And hopefully, some of their grief might at least temporarily be spent in being able to embrace Victor Cruz."" Cruz first heard that one of the victims at Sandy Hook Elementary was a fan through his Twitter feed. He spoke to the Pinto family on Saturday night from his hotel room in Atlanta, making a promise to the boy's 11-year-old brother, Ben, that he would stay in touch. So on Tuesday, the Giants' off day, he drove with his fiancÃ©e and 11-month-old daughter to keep that pledge. He played football in the front yard with some of the other kids in the neighborhood, . ""We got to smile a little bit, which was good for them,"" Cruz said. ""It was a time where I just wanted to be a positive voice, a positive light in a time where it can be really negative. They're a great family, and they're really united right now, and it was good to see. ""We reached out to them, and we exchanged information, so we're going to try as much as we can to keep in contact. Just little things, just to say hello a couple months from now, years, and just say 'How you doing?' and stuff like that, just to see how they're doing from time to time."" Sometimes, the little things can show that the ""power of sports"" is more than just a clichÃ©.

"(CNN) -- Pesach Sommer, 42, is an eight-time marathon runner. He's completed at least 10 half-marathons and lost count of the number of 5Ks and 10Ks he has run. His track record isn't bad, considering he only started running in 2007. That was when he finally went to the doctor. He knew he was overweight at 250 pounds: 100 pounds overweight, to be exact. But what really got his attention was when the doctor told him he had type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is usually a byproduct of obesity; extra fat on the body makes it hard for your system to produce enough insulin to keep blood sugar levels at a normal level. It is a reversible condition. ""It was my come-to-Jesus moment,"" the rabbi said. At the time, he was a father of five and knew that he had to do something or his wife would end up a widow and a single parent. The fear first hit Sommer when he marked the anniversary of his father's death. That year of mourning was stressful, driving him to become an emotional eater who packed an additional 30 pounds onto his already heavy frame. His father had been a chronically stressed smoker with type 2 diabetes, and Sommer knew he was following in his father's footsteps. Yet he was in denial about it until that doctor's appointment. The doctor told him that he had to lose weight and that he would have to prick himself every day to check his blood sugar. Squeamish about blood, he knew ""that was not going to happen."" So in June 2007, he bought a stationary bike and started pedaling while watching episodes of the TV show ""24."" He started riding it for an hour a day. If each episode's cliffhanger was good enough to hook him to the next episode, he'd keep going for as long as he was watching. He also changed what he was eating. ""Little by little, I started to cut out everything bad for me,"" recalled Sommer, of Passaic, New Jersey. He stopped eating desserts and started eating fruits and vegetables. Then he cut out processed sugar. He had dieted before but never successfully. This time was different: He was seeing results, so he stuck to it. He was still eating three meals a day but choosing his love of life over his love of food. Sommer spent the summer of 2007 working in a camp. He walked everywhere, which allowed him to shed a noticeable amount of weight. ""As the pounds melted away and Pesach added a new hole to his belt to make it tighter, it was a celebration,"" his wife Rochie says. One morning, he told Rochie he wanted to run a marathon. The very next day, he was approached by someone offering a training program for a race that was four months away. Certain it was meant to be, he registered to run the half-marathon. Looking back, he concedes he might have been a little delusional to think he could run a half-marathon simply because he had been riding a stationary bike and had lost a little weight. ""When I started to run, I just had to run for one minute, and I was out of breath. I wondered, what did I just get myself into?"" But he forged ahead and noticed the weight was coming off faster, at a rate of about 2Â½ pounds per week. He signed up for a 5K race before the half-marathon and finished. What's more, he realized he liked running, not only because it helped him lose weight but because it was a stress reliever. ""I love the freedom to be out there and think about what's going on, what's important for me."" By the time he ran that half-marathon, Sommer had lost about 75 pounds. He was sleeping better, had more energy to play with his children and was more productive at work. Almost immediately, he signed up for another one. Then he signed up for a full marathon. He ran the 26.2-mile race in January 2008. By May 2008, he had reached his goal weight of 150 pounds. Now, marathons are his love. Running has also become a family affair; five of his eight children have run with him at various races. ""The message of good eating and good healthy living makes an impact on the entire family,"" Rochie says. ""When Pesach qualified for Boston... I booked a hotel for all of us six months in advance to make sure we would be there to cheer him on."" Sommer says he used to joke that he traded an eating addiction for a running addiction, but there is some truth to it. Running used to define him. Nothing stopped him from pounding the pavement, be it a storm outside or a storm of a different sort brewing at home. Now, when he's training for a race, he runs 20 to 40 miles a week and says that's the right balance for his health and his family. When he's not training, he cuts back on his mileage. When it comes to food, his key is planning. He decides what he is going to eat before he comes to the table and walks away after he has it, whether he feels full or not. He asks himself why he is eating, to figure out whether he is really hungry or just eating for enjoyment. The strategy has worked: He's lost 100 pounds since that doctor's appointment in 2007 and kept it off. He's wearing clothes he says he never could have imagined he'd fit into; his waist is the size it was when he was in seventh grade. Although the physical results are nice, Sommer says there is also a psychological and emotional lift, too. He feels much more in control of his life. People often ask him for a magic way to melt away the pounds. He advises them to exercise three to four times a week and change their eating habits. Anyone can do it, he says. ""You have to be honest with yourself. If you love eating and that's more important than losing weight, then eat.""","Pesach Sommer lost 100 pounds after a doctor told him he had type 2 diabetes .

"(CNN) -- You probably heard the story. It is, after all, so last week. A wealthy banker goes out to lunch with a colleague. The banker disdainfully leaves a 1% tip on a $133 bill with the message, ""Get a real job."" The colleague, who runs a blog called ""Future Ex-Banker,"" takes a picture of the receipt, which then goes viral -- first on Eater.com, then on Twitter and Facebook, soon everywhere (including CNN). It was a hoax, however, though it took a few days before the restaurant found proof the original receipt had been Photoshopped. By that time, despite some disclaimers along the way, the bill had become water-cooler gospel and left outrage in its wake. So it goes on the Internet, where errors, mistakes and knee-jerk reactions can be let loose at the click of a button. CNN Photos: Our mobile addiction . Sure, it's been that way since your grandmother e-mailed you the story about the Nieman-Marcus chocolate-chip cookie recipe. But in an increasingly connected world where social networking has made us all news sources, that means missteps and misinformation get issued -- and repeated -- more quickly than ever. Gabrielle Giffords is declared dead, Chris Brown lets fly with profane rants, and it all makes the rounds before anyone has time to think. ""There's never been such pressure to speak before one knows,"" says science writer James Gleick, who traced the increasing speed of society in his book ""Faster"" and the deluge of data in last year's ""The Information."" There's always been a desire to gather and disseminate news, he points out, ""but never until now has it been global and instantaneous."" We want information, but more than that, we want it quickly -- and thanks to smartphones, which now comprise the majority of cell phones in the United States, we're never far away from the latest bits of media. Moreover, with cellular companies promoting blazing ""4G"" speeds and trying to expand their networks, it's harder and harder to be out of touch -- and easier and easier to give in to the twitch of the clicker finger. And accuracy? Speed rules, baby. Even when your phone attempts to helpfully AutoCorrect a hastily written text, the result is as often mocked as appreciated. So much for patience. We want the world to listen, and we want it now. ""Everyone now has a global platform on which they can shout their opinions and voice their beliefs,"" says Frank Farley, a psychology professor at Temple University and former president of the American Psychological Association. But people haven't become more cautious about putting words out there, he adds -- even if they're wrong. ""There's an old economic principle, that bad money drives out good,"" he says. ""One thing that worries me is that bad information is driving out good."" Me first! Of course, the desire to be first, even at the risk of being wrong, is nothing new. But social networks and real-time Internet portability have combined to spawn errors and reactions at an increasingly breakneck pace, particularly on Twitter, which -- with its brevity and scope -- makes it easy to disseminate clickbacks and comebacks in 140 characters or fewer. Many errors are minor. Actor LeVar Burton, mistaking Twitter's private and public spheres, accidentally released his phone number to the entire Twitterverse, then backtracked with a joke. Celebrity rumors roar through all the time, causing quick kerfuffles as they're checked and then dismissed. Others, however, are more dramatic. Last month controversial hip-hop singer Chris Brown posted a defiant message after the Grammys -- a tweet that didn't go over well. Soon afterward, Brown (or his handlers) deleted all evidence of his Twitter tantrum, but not before bloggers had grabbed screen shots of the offending missives. Several news services initially tweeted that Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords had died in the Tucson shootings last year. When Giffords was confirmed to be alive, some deleted their early posts. Actor Ashton Kutcher, who has close to 10 million Twitter followers, tweeted a protest of Penn State coach Joe Paterno's firing -- before realizing why Paterno was being let go. Kutcher later apologized, deleted his earlier messages and finally put his Twitter account under the control of his publicists. Wrong or right, speed is exciting, says Gleick. ""The fact is, we love this fast pace. We're exhilarated by it,"" he says. ""We're happy to be able to reach in a pocket and press a button or speak to our device and instantaneously get an answer to a question -- even if we know that the answer is not 100% reliable."" And being first (or, to many Internet commenters, ""First!"") is even better: the ""primacy effect,"" it's called in psychology. We tend to remember the first items in a series more than later entries. With speed of the essence, some websites have built a following by trafficking in rumors and uncertainties. In tech, of course, there are any number of sites devoted to all things Apple, which seize on the smallest bits of information, then watch as the unconfirmed reports get picked up by larger tech sites until they go mainstream. The sociologist Erving Goffman observed that people have ""front-stage"" and ""backstage"" presentations of themselves -- the former a polished form intended for public consumption, the latter raw and unedited. ""I think there's more and more of the backstage leaking into day-to-day conversation,"" says Ron Bishop, a pop culture professor at Drexel University. That's not necessarily a bad thing. For corporations such as Apple, an outburst of rumors certainly creates (or maintains) interest. The availability of smartphones encourages citizen journalism. And the ability to post quickly means that misinformation can also be corrected quickly, often after the Twitterverse flags an error. Truthyness . The flip side, however, plays off Farley's concern that bad information will drive out good. ""You can do a fast correction, but it hardly ever has the value of the original,"" he points out. Social networks are also useful in spreading propaganda and disinformation, observes Filippo Menczer, a professor of informatics at Indiana University. It's the latest twist on unwittingly forwarding viruses via e-mail. Menczer, who directs IU's Center for Complex Networks and Systems Research, has helped develop Truthy, a system to analyze Twitter posts that he was inspired to set up after the 2010 Massachusetts special senate election. An activist group created several fake Twitter accounts and put out misleading claims about one candidate; thousands of followers retweeted the information. Though Twitter quickly disabled the accounts, the information was spread widely enough to rank highly in Google results. Truthy attempts to find out who's responsible for the initial message, how it has been spread and determine if the message is true. There are some tip-offs, Menczer observes, such as if the initial message comes from a now-inactive account or one with a suspicious name. (In the case of the 1% receipt, the ""Future Ex-Banker's"" blog was inactive by the time other sites started sniffing around, though it was thought that he was remaining anonymous for less suspicious reasons.) Americans may associate such disinformation campaigns with domestic politics, but they have also taken root overseas, Menczer adds. As social media has become a key tool in quickly spreading the word about meetings and protests -- such as the world saw during the Arab Spring -- it can also be used against such efforts. During Russia's current election campaign, for example, fake accounts posted inaccurate information, making it very difficult for protesters to coordinate through social media, he says. Given the rush of information on the Web -- and that ever-itchy clicker finger -- the best strategy may be a little self-control, says Temple's Farley. Though, he adds, it's not easy, particularly with a generation that has come of age with the latest technologies and thinks nothing of not thinking. ""In this world of hyper-stimulation, how do you develop kids who are reflective, who can think before they act?"" he says. ""That's going to be extremely important going forward, because there's so much opportunity for stimulation."" Better to take a breath, have the facts straight -- or risk adding to the flood of error. It's a truism that certainly predates the Internet. ""A lie can travel halfway 'round the world while the truth is putting on its shoes,"" Mark Twain once said. Hmm. Or did he?","Thanks to social media, missteps and misinformation get repeated more quickly than ever .

"(CNN) -- It took a little longer than most people expected but MotoGP whiz kid Marc Marquez wrapped up a second world title in Japan. The 21-year-old finished runner-up behind compatriot Jorge Lorenzo -- and crucially ahead of the legendary Italian Valentino Rossi and Dani Pedrosa -- to take an unassailable 82-point lead in the championship with three rounds to go. The landmark means Marquez beat Mike Hailwood's record, set in 1963, to become the youngest ever rider to win consecutive titles. But perhaps more importantly for his Repsol Honda team, he did it at Motegi. This track is sacred ground for Honda. The Japanese giants designed and built the track; it is where they test their cars as well as their bikes, and it also houses Honda's museum. As such, the pressure to perform here is intense. Perhaps because of this, no Honda rider had ever managed to clinch the championship here -- until now. In the end it was an efficient performance from the reigning champion, but there was no sense of inevitability. Rossi blasted into the lead, while a muscular pass from Lorenzo saw Marquez fall back to seventh place on the race's first corner. The champion fought his way up to fourth on the second lap, but Lorenzo looked to be a man on a mission, first breaking the lap record and then ducking past his Movistar Yamaha teammate Rossi on lap five to take a lead he would maintain to the line. For Marquez the key was to finish ahead of Pedrosa and Rossi, and gradually he settled into the task. Easing past his fellow Spaniard, he then closed the gap on the Italian. After 14 laps he finally caught him, but his first attempted pass saw the wily Rossi immediately bite back to retake second. A lap later though and Marquez took advantage of the Honda's superior cornering to slip inside the Yamaha's line. It was all he needed to do, and the remaining eight laps saw him cement his place and cross the line in comfort. The sea of red-clad Marquez fans in Motegi's packed stands erupted. Marquez had talked before about the burden of expectation as his season unfolded, and he appeared as relieved as he was delighted to finally seal the title. ""Two years in MotoGP, two titles. It's incredible,"" Marquez told reporters. ""I couldn't have imagined it. ""Maybe to people it looked easy because I am always smiling and always happy, but also I feel pressure."" Lorenzo's victory, his second in two races, equals five-time world champion Mick Doohan's record of 54 grand prix victories, moving him up to him up to joint fifth place in the all-time winners list. But his return to form has come too late for him to threaten Marquez for the championship. ""We are happy for Marc that he won the title,"" he said. ""This year he was the best in general, so we want to say congratulations."" Rossi, enjoying something of an Indian summer to his career back at Yamaha, also congratulated the young champion: ""I have to say that he deserves this championship. He worked well and was the stronger man this year."" Samurai celebrations . MotoGP is a sport that thrives on spectacle, and Marquez had saved a special treat for his fans at the checkered flag. A man in full samurai costume, flanked by two women in geisha dresses, appeared on the track side gravel through a red smoke of fireworks. The samurai handed Marquez a sword, with which the champion cut the string of a balloon bearing the number one. A geisha then handed him a gold helmet, which he donned to perform his lap of honor. It was a fitting celebration for a truly extraordinary rider. Sibling rivalry? Since the end of Marquez's record equaling winning run in Brno the MotoGP championship has seen different winners and tight contests, which will have relieved the Spaniard's rivals as well as the sport's administrators. He is still one win short of equallng Mick Doohan's record of 12 wins in a season, but Doohan himself warns that the period of Marquez domination may have just begun. ""He's lifted the bar quite substantially this year,"" the Australian told BT Sport. ""Last year he moved it, this year he's added to that. For someone to take away this dominance -- it's either Lorenzo or another guy coming through, and at the moment who's that?"" It is not an easy question to answer, but contenders are out there. And there may be one very close to home. It was a double celebration for the Marquez family as younger brother Alex snatched victory in the Moto3 class. The junior sibling leads that championship; the prospect of the brothers fighting for future titles in the premier class is a mouth watering one.","Marc Marquez defends his MotoGP crown with second place in Japan .

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Reports of at least 150 Muslims killed in recent religious clashes in Nigeria should be investigated, a human rights group urged Saturday. Witnesses told Human Rights Watch that armed men attacked Kuru Karama in central Nigeria on Tuesday, ""killing many as they tried to flee and burning many others alive,"" the international organization said Saturday. The assailants targeted Muslims, reportedly killing at least 150, Human Rights Watch said. Community leaders from Jos, a city about 19 miles north of Kuru Karama, and journalists told the organization that later in the week they saw dozens of bodies lodged in wells or sewage pits. The bodies of 121 people, including 22 children, had been recovered, the organization said. Most of the homes in the town were burned down, along with three mosques, the group said. Those interviewed by the group said they thought the attackers were Christian, Human Rights Watch said. But even Christians were not spared. When a Christian pastor tried to stop the attacks he was beaten, a Muslim imam told the group. Human Rights Watch called on Vice President Goodluck Jonathan to open a criminal investigation into the deaths based on the reports the groups said were credible. Officials are still tallying death figures in the latest round of violence, said H.A. Angulu, director of public communications for the Ministry of Information and Communications. ""Yes [the clashes] occurred, but I cannot confirm any numbers,"" he told CNN. ""At this time the government is still compiling figures of those people affected and of those displaced in Jos. They are accounting for the deceased and missing. At this time I cannot confirm the number of dead."" Earlier this week, dozens were reportedly killed in clashes in Jos. Angulu did not specifically address the reports about Kuru Karama. On Thursday, Jonathan declared in a televised address that the attackers in the state of Plateau would be held accountable, according to Human Rights Watch. Police were called to end the attacks, but they did not, the group reported witnesses as saying. Hundreds have died in clashes between Christians and Muslims in central Plateau state in the past decade. The most populous country in Africa, with a population of more than 150 million, Nigeria is almost evenly divided between Muslims and Christians. With more than 78 million Muslims, it has the sixth largest Islamic population in the world, according to a study last year by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life. A curfew was imposed Tuesday -- the same day as the reported attack in Kuru Karama -- in Jos after violence flared up there following unrest on Sunday. A local activist said 69 people had been killed and about 600 injured in the most recent outbreak. Thousands more were displaced, seeking shelter in military and police headquarters, said Sani Shehu of the Civil Rights Congress in Jos. There was no independent confirmation of Shehu's figures. It is unclear what sparked the latest violence. In November 2008, at least 700 Nigerians died in Christian-Muslim riots that followed a disputed local election, Human Rights Watch reported. CNN's Andreena Narayan contributed to this report.","At least 150 Muslims reported killed in Christian rampages .

"Washington (CNN) -- The head of the Environmental Protection Agency's office in Dallas has resigned over comments he made in 2010 that became the focus of political condemnation last week. EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said Monday that she accepted a letter of resignation from Al Armendariz. ""I respect the difficult decision he made and his wish to avoid distracting from the important work of the agency,"" Jackson said in a written statement. In the letter dated Sunday, Armendariz said he regrets his comments, adding that they did not reflect on his work or the work of the EPA. The controversy erupted last week when a video surfaced showing Armendariz saying in 2010 that his methods for dealing with non-compliant oil and gas companies were ""like when the Romans conquered the villages in the Mediterranean. They'd go into little villages in Turkish towns and they'd find the first five guys they saw and crucify them."" Sen. James Inhofe's office told CNN it uncovered the video while preparing for a blistering half-hour Senate floor speech that Inhofe delivered Wednesday. In the speech, the Republican from Oklahoma criticized the Obama administration's energy policies and cited Armendariz in particular. ""His comments give us a rare glimpse into the Obama administration's true agenda,"" Inofe said. After the video went viral, Armendariz quickly issued an apology. But Inhofe rejected the apology, and the White House and EPA dissociated themselves from the administrator's remarks. ""Administrator Armendariz apologized yesterday for his 'poor choice of words' when he admitted that EPA's 'general philosophy' is to 'crucify' and 'make examples' of oil and gas companies, but he did not apologize for EPA's actions towards its apparent crucifixion victims,"" Inhofe said. ""Take the word 'crucify' out of Administrator Armendariz's statement and nothing has changed: You still have a rogue agency following through on President Obama's 'general philosophy' to increase the price of gas and electricity,"" Inhofe added. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters Thursday that ""the official's comments are inaccurate as a representation or characterization of the way the EPA has operated under President Obama."" In a statement posted on its website, the EPA said it was ""deeply unfortunate that in a 2010 video an EPA official inaccurately suggested we are seeking to 'make examples' out of certain companies in the oil and gas industry."" Armendariz was on a leave of absence from his job as a professor at Southern Methodist University while he served with the EPA. He was appointed by Obama in 2009. The remarks surfaced at a critical time for Obama's re-election campaign. The administration's energy policies have been targeted by critics, including Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, who blame the president's policies for higher oil and gas prices. On Friday, a letter signed by the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Republican members requested clarification of Armendariz's enforcement strategies and policies while leading the agency's Region 6 office. The committee said it ""will use all authorities at its disposal to ensure Armendariz's attendance"" at an upcoming hearing. CNN's Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","The 2010 comment by Al Armendariz drew protests from Republicans .

"New York (CNN) -- The conviction of a former New York police officer for conspiring to kidnap, torture, cook and eat women has been overturned by a federal judge, who ruled that the evidence against him amounted to ""fantasy role-play."" Gilberto Valle, who has already served 21 months in jail and faced life in prison on the kidnap conspiracy conviction, did not say a word when he appeared in a federal courtroom Tuesday. He smiled and waved at relatives in court. One woman, in tears, said before the hearing, ""He's coming home today."" Prosecutors said they will appeal the decision, and bail for Valle was set at $100,000. He could be released as early as Tuesday. Defense attorney Julia Gatto said the decision backed up her assertion that Valle is ""guilty of nothing more than very unconventional thoughts ... We don't put people in jail for their thoughts. We are not the thought police and the court system is not the deputy of the thought police."" ""Gil Valle has been in jail for almost 21 months, seven months of that were in the indescribable hell that is solitary confinement, all for a crime that he didn't commit,"" she said. Valle was ordered to undergo a mental health evaluation, and to surrender travel documents and weapons. U.S. District Court Judge Paul Gardephe also ordered GPS home monitoring for the defendant. ""The evidentiary record is such that it is more likely than not the case that all of Valle's Internet communications about kidnapping are fantasy role-play,"" Gardephe said in the 118-page opinion released Monday night. Valle's lawyers argued at his trial last year that the former police officer's e-mails and online postings were just that -- ""fantasy role-play"" and ""dark improv theater."" But prosecutors said he was ""deadly serious."" In his decision, Gardephe ruled that ""once the lies and the fantastical elements are stripped away, what is left are deeply disturbing misogynistic chats and emails written by an individual obsessed with imagining women he knows suffering horrific sex-related pain, terror and degradation."" ""Despite the highly disturbing nature of Valle's deviant and depraved sexual interests, his chats and emails about these interests are not sufficient -- standing alone -- to make out the elements of conspiracy to commit kidnapping,"" he added. The trial evidence provided by prosecutors was not ""sufficient to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that Valle entered into a genuine agreement to kidnap a woman, or that he specifically intended to commit a kidnapping."" Valle also was found guilty of illegally accessing a federal law enforcement database. The database, which Valle was trained to use and had access to as a police officer, helped him research potential victims, prosecutors said. No one was kidnapped, but the jury did see what prosecutors said were detailed plans to carry out a plot. Valle, a six-year NYPD veteran, was convicted after prosecutors presented evidence such as a document found on his wife's laptop titled ""Abducting and Cooking Kimberly -- A Blueprint."" The same document listed ""materials needed,"" which included a gag, rope, chloroform and a tarp for the trunk. The FBI never found any of these items in Valle's possession. According to trial evidence, he communicated online with three co-conspirators on the Dark Fetish Network, prosecutors said. At trial, Gatto called Valle's conduct ""pure fiction"" and ""make-believe."" ""He is anxious to get home to his family, the people who supported him through this whole ordeal,"" she said of her client on Tuesday. ""I am sure he is very relieved, very tired. Prison has been hard... He has to pick up the pieces of his life.""

According to Parks' representative, the mom of two has ""retained an attorney with the intent of amicably ending her marriage."" The news comes a month after Nida reported to prison to begin an eight-year federal sentence for a fraud conviction. The reality star pleaded guilty in May to charges in a fraud scheme that federal prosecutors say stole millions of dollars from at least 50 people over four years.

"(CNN) -- Listen carefully at the corner of Trade and Tryon streets in uptown Charlotte, and you'll hear the sounds that make the Queen City one of the country's best-kept secrets. The laughter of old men playing chess in a courtyard. The music from Alive after Five, a weekly summer outdoor concert series that draws hundreds of young professionals looking to loosen their ties and unwind after work. The roar of the fans at Bank of America Stadium, where Panthers quarterback sensation Cam Newton has just breathed life into a good-as-dead team. iReport: Share photos and tips for Charlotte . The drone of the ever-present street sweeper, keeping the city as sparkling as its skyscrapers. The soft breeze rustling the blooming trees of spring. The silence on a hot summer day when most Charlotteans flee the city for the cooling relief of Lake Norman, just 20 minutes north. I last stood at that intersection in the center of the city more than two years ago, right before I moved to Atlanta. I thought foolishly then that I needed a bigger city. The truth is, I've never missed Charlotte more. iReport: Share photos and tips for Tampa . The people . I grew up in Northern Virginia, which -- if you're from the D.C. area -- you know is not really the South, despite its geographical location below the Mason-Dixon line. Southern, I am not. I take my tea unsweet, still haven't acquired a taste for collards and find it physically impossible for my mouth to form the word ""y'all."" So why did I fall in love with Charlotte, North Cackalacky? A former colleague of mine at The Charlotte Observer once wrote that the best icebreaker question in Charlotte is, ""Where are you from?"" The region, with 1.8 million residents, is teeming with newcomers, making it a melting pot of accents and cultures. City smackdown: New York vs. Los Angeles . In my group of friends, we hailed from Iowa, Indiana, New York, Boston and Michigan. Out of all of us, only one was part of the increasingly endangered species known as native Charlotteans. A big part of the draw is Charlotte's banking institutions. The city is home to Bank of America, and Wells Fargo's East Coast offices are headquartered there. But the mild year-round weather and its proximity to the beach and the mountains -- Charleston's just three hours away and Asheville a mere two -- are what entice people to lay down roots. Destination USA: Miami beyond the beaches . The food . The diversity of Charlotte's residents makes for an equally eclectic restaurant scene. My favorite Indian restaurant to date is Copper, in the streetcar suburb of Dilworth. When I crave a burger, I immediately think of Bad Daddy's Burger Bar. On a cold winter night, nothing warms you up like the chicken and dumplings at Dish in the funky neighborhood of Plaza Midwood, where tattooed and pierced waiters serve up comfort food with a side of sass. Have a sweet tooth? My mouth still waters at the thought of the salted caramel brownies at Amelie's French Bakery in the NoDa (North Davidson) Historic Arts District. Open 24/7, the Parisian-style bakery is typically filled with local entrepreneurs and college students sipping coffee and munching on pastries over their laptops. I could begin a debate about how Eastern North Carolina-style barbecue is superior to all others, but that's another column. Instead, if you're in Charlotte, get a pork barbecue plate at Bill Spoon's, a local institution in south Charlotte since 1963. When its namesake owner died in 2007, it prompted an outpouring of condolences from the community. Spoon's grandson still operates the restaurant, keeping up Bill's legacy of good 'cue and better service. And finally, no visit to Charlotte is complete without stopping at Price's Chicken Coop for the best fried chicken you will ever eat. Walk across the street and grab a spot on the grass to savor the crispy decadence: There is no seating inside, and lines form long before the noon lunch hour. At your first bite, you'll realize why actor-singer Lenny Kravitz said recently that the thing he misses most about filming ""Hunger Games"" in Charlotte is Price's chicken. North Carolina lures 'Hunger Games' fans . The lifestyle . I lived in Charlotte for five years, two of which were spent covering the city's nightlife and entertainment scene for the newspaper. As part of my job, I attended concerts, took in touring Broadway plays, sipped cocktails at almost every local watering hole, partied with NASCAR drivers and Panthers players, and rubbed elbows with the city's leaders at high-end charity events. Since I've left, the number of attractions has grown even further, with the opening of the NASCAR Hall of Fame and a four-venue arts complex comprised of three museums and an intimate theater.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- From ""Gladiator"" to ""The Lion King"", ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" to ""The Simpsons,"" film composer Hans Zimmer's versatile and imaginative scores have added aural color, light and shade to the on-screen action. Composer Hans Zimmer, interviewed by CNN's Screening Room . Nominated for an Oscar seven times (he won for 1995's ""The Lion King""), Zimmer had just two weeks of formal music lessons as a child. He worked as an assistant to film composer Stanley Myers in London where he learnt ""how to wrestle an orchestra to the ground"" while making the coffee. That led to a job with Myers on Nic Roeg's epic ""Eureka"" -- and the rest is film history. CNN's The Screening Room talked to him about the magic that music can bring to the movies. ................................. CNN: What is the reality behind the glamour of working as a film composer? Hans Zimmer: It's an industry that relies so heavily on the idea that I will wake up tomorrow morning with a great tune in my head. This usually doesn't happen, so it's a whole industry based on the fallacy that we, the filmmakers, will actually come up with some good ideas and meet our deadlines, when really we sit in our rooms by ourselves and knock our heads against the wall until something happens. Most of my ideas are terrible and occasionally there's a glimmer of hope and a decent tune comes out; but to make a movie you have to rely very heavily on the creative input of everyone else. I love speaking with the editors, hanging out with the director and whoever. The movie shapes itself through these conversations. CNN: Which comes first, the music or the film? HZ: It changes all the time. You grab a fragment of something to start an idea with; tiny ideas. It's a complete hodgepodge of ways of sneaking up on the beast. For instance, on ""Pirates 3,"" a lot of the music was written while Gore was shooting or before he went off shooting the movie. Finally, I moved the whole studio to Disney's cutting rooms because being in the same space as the movie makes a difference and part of what I should do is try to inspire the production. With ""The Simpsons,"" I thought, ""Hang on a second, they've been around for years but none of the characters have any themes really."" So I was just noodling around. I try to understand my characters. Why are they like this? And why would I find it even remotely compelling to watch a story about a weird character like this and what's funny about it? And after all this semi-intelligent talk it really comes down to flailing around and hoping that some of those notes make sense and that they can tell a story. CNN: Your score for ""Gladiator"" really stands out. What inspired you on this film? HZ: It started off with Ridley phoning me. He goes, ""I'm going to be shooting this big battle scene south of London. Why don't you come over and we'll have a chat?"" And I'm driving through this wood and I get to a dirt track; and it's a miserable day, only the way England in November can be. Suddenly I'm in this Roman encampment with these beautiful tents and in the background there are guys just killing each other with swords in the mud. It's a big battle scene and it's grubby as hell, but Ridley and I are having this meeting in the Marcus Aurelius tent set and he's got this beautiful bed in there with a mink throw on top of it and it's all purple and red and silk and there are all these amazing marble busts. I started thinking about antiquity and about going to Rome and seeing these fantastic artifacts which enrich our life nowadays, and how it was really all built on the blood and sweat of slaves. And I thought, ""How benign, how wonderful. We see these sculptures and we forget how people have suffered for this."" I thought, ""I want to find the most benign, banal music and sort of savage it up and make it our battle music."" I thought of Viennese waltzes. So all the battles are scored with these Viennese waltzes. CNN: Is your relationship with the director the key to getting the score perfect? HZ: Yes, there has to be an element of friendship and trust and at the same time an element of give and take. A director can be in control on pretty much everything: he can rewrite lines in the script; he can act a little for the actors; he can look into the camera and adjust all that. But when it comes to music, it's tricky territory: what's he going to say to me? C major to F major? That would be good here? It's meaningless, so the conversation becomes different. You want to take their vision, whatever it is, beyond what he had. CNN: How do you find sounds? HZ: I go there. With Ridley's ""Black Hawk Down,"" I sent Mark Stridenfeld, who's now composing Ridley's new film, out into the desert to these villages to see what they play. I told him, ""See if you can buy any instruments or record some of the stuff."" Mark came back with a plethora of weird instruments which we then had to wonder, 'Do you blow into this or do you hit it?' I've spent a lot of time going to Africa and recording indigenous instruments or choirs or whatever. Anything can become a musical sound. The wind on telegraph wires is a great sound; get it into your machine and play it and it becomes interesting. CNN: Describe the moment of playing your first musical sketches to a director. HZ: Terror. You can't defend it and it's very simple: however it lands, this thing that you have slaved over, if it doesn't resonate; if it doesn't communicate, you gotta start again. It's -- I'm hedging around having to say the sentence because it sounds pretentious -- you write stuff from your heart. When you play anything for anybody for the first time it's terrifying because you're letting them having a look at a very vulnerable part of you. CNN: You have to be such a chameleon as a composer. HZ: I love ducking and diving. I did ""Black Rain"" and ""Driving Miss Daisy"" in the same month. I finished ""Pirates,"" had one day off and got into ""The Simpsons"" and it's a very different language. And I think that's what keeps it interesting; certainly for me. CNN: Tell us a bit about the relationship between a movie score composer and a songwriter, for example Elton John in ""The Lion King."" HZ: This was pretty early on in my career. I'm a huge Elton fan and always was. Elton had done these piano demos. I took the first one, 'Circle of Life,' and made up my mind there were two ways I could approach it: I could either be really respectful of Elton's notes and what he had done, and very slavishly try to orchestrate it, or I could try to make it my own, usurp it, throw my stuff at it and go crazy, which is pretty much what I did. Then they had to show it to Elton and I'm sitting next to him, pretty nervous -- and on the CD you get Elton's version and my version and you can see how radically different they are -- and the great thing about him is he's so secure in his artistry as a songwriter that he loved it. And it was the beginning of a very good friendship. CNN: Are there particular challenges working on animated films as opposed to live action films? HZ: With animated film you have to create the sonic world; there's nothing there. You get to color things in more and you're allowed to overreach yourself a little bit more and it's great fun. CNN: You've also mentored a number of others. Why is that important for you? HZ: When I first started working here I noticed there was the A-list and then no one else got to work, and the A-list was pretty small. The other thing that really bugged me was that people who had an enormous amount of talent didn't get to do these movies 'cause they couldn't get hold of the technology. And I thought 'hey I have a studio' and these are my friends. So I let them have access to the tools and let people hear their music; simple as that. CNN: When do you think a score works best as opposed to a soundtrack of pre-existing songs? HZ: It depends. ""The Graduate"" must be the best use of songs ever in a movie; it adds a layer to the movie you wouldn't ever get from a score. ""The Mission Law,"" ""Chariots of Fire,"" ""Lawrence of Arabia"" -- I can't imagine those movies would have worked as well with just a bunch of songs put into them. It doesn't matter how good they are. They serve different purposes. Songs come with baggage. A score usually doesn't -- a score is strictly for that moment in time. CNN: What distinguishes a great score from a good score? HZ: There are very few great scores. I can think of a handful: ""Once upon a time in the West,"" Randy Newman's score for ""Avalon,"" ""Brazil,"" Michael Cayman's score; just using one song and creating a whole world out of it. ""Lawrence of Arabia."" The movie and the score are truly one and it gives you an incredibly complete experience. They are of a musical quality; they transcend background music. They have a point of view, they have a great tune attached to them and incredible craftsmanship. E-mail to a friend .","Hans Zimmer's scores include ""The Lion King"" and ""The Simpsons Movie""

"(CNN) -- Sounding as much like a Western leader as a Middle Eastern one, Iran's president is denouncing ISIS in strong terms, but even in firm opposition he's hardly embracing the U.S.-led military effort intent on destroying the extremist group. Hassan Rouhani, in an interview with NBC News, characterized ISIS's recent beheadings of three Western captives are offensive to all people, including Muslims like himself. ""They want to kill humanity and, from the viewpoint of the Islamic tenets and culture, killing an innocent person equals the killing of (all) humanity,"" Rouhani said of ISIS militants, according to the translation on NBC's website. "" ... The killing and beheading of innocent people, in fact, is a matter of shame on them and a matter of concern and sorry for all ... mankind."" The only relevant thing about the victims is that they were innocent, not their nationalities or religions, according to Rouhani. The three killed were British aid worker David Haines and American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff. Sotloff was Jewish and had dual citizenship with Israel. ""Who can really tolerate to see an innocent person be executed?"" said the Iranian president. ""It doesn't make any difference, from our viewpoint, if the person is Muslim, Jewish, Christian or (a) follower of any other religion. It is not important to us ... which nationality he belongs to."" Rouhani's position on ISIS isn't entirely new or unexpected. The group is made up of Sunni Muslims aiming to create a vast caliphate in the region under its strict, distinct version of Sharia law. Iran consists predominantly of Shia Muslims, and it could find itself under attack if ISIS militants move east from Iraq into its territory. Iran isn't alone in its stance on ISIS. U.S. President Barack Obama has been active in his opposition to the group, ordering airstrikes targeting ISIS in Iraq and promising similar air attacks on the group in Syria. In his NBC interview, Rouhani did not appear supportive or impressed with Washington's plan to form a coalition -- one which he called ""ridiculous"" -- or its using airstrikes, rather than ground forces, to combat the ISIS threat. Obama, Kerry: No U.S. troops to be sent into combat . The Iranian president asked rhetorically if the United States, by conducting airstrikes but refusing to put its own troops into battle, is ""afraid of their soldiers being killed in the fight they claim is against terrorism."" ""If they want to use planes and if they want to use unmanned planes, so that nobody is injured from the Americans -- is it really possible to fight terrorism without any hardship, without any sacrifice?"" he added. Rouhani then made an apparent allusion to possible airstrikes against ISIS in Syria -- something that U.S. officials would be done without coordinating with the government of President Bashar al-Assad. Washington has backed moderate opposition forces working to oust al-Assad; Tehran, meanwhile, is an ally of the embattled Syrian leader. ""Maybe it is necessary for airstrikes in some conditions and some circumstances,"" Rouhani told NBC's Ann Curry. ""However, airstrikes should take place with the permission of the people of that county and the government of that country."" Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, told state-run Press TV that Iran turned down an invite from Denmark Foreign Minister Martin Lidegaard to join the U.S.-led alliance to fight ISIS. Shamkhani surmised Wednesday that one of this coalition's chief goals is to protect Israel and that Tehran doesn't believe it will be effective. ""The alliance ... for confronting this terrorist group is an effort to forge safe borders for the Zionist regime rather than bring about regional stability and security for the oppressed people of the (Middle East),"" he said.","NEW: Rouhani on U.S. strikes: ""Is it really possible to fight terrorism without ... sacrifice?""

"DENVER, Colorado (CNN)  -- Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton likely will release her delegates to Sen. Barack Obama, a Democratic official said Sunday, the eve of the Democratic National Convention. Sen. Hillary Clinton will meet with her delegates on Wednesday before that night's roll call, a spokesman says. Also Sunday, the Democratic Party decided delegates from Michigan and Florida -- states that had been penalized for moving their 2008 presidential primaries to January -- will get full voting rights at the event. The moves answer some questions that lingered ahead of the convention, which starts Monday in Denver. Clinton, who suspended her presidential campaign in June after Obama secured enough delegates to win the party's nomination, will meet with her delegates at a reception in Denver on Wednesday afternoon -- before that evening's delegate vote on the nominee, said a Democratic official who asked not to be named. ""[The reception is] an opportunity for Sen. Clinton to see her delegates -- many for the first time since the primaries ended -- thank them for their hard work and support and most importantly, to encourage them to support and work for Sen. Obama as strongly as she has, in order to elect him in November,"" Clinton spokesman Philippe Reines said. Because Clinton suspended her campaign instead of dropping out, she kept the pledged delegates she earned in the primaries and caucuses. Earlier this month, Obama's campaign said it agreed to put Clinton's name in nomination at the convention ""in recognition of the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nation's primary contests."" Watch a preview of the convention . Clinton already has urged the 18 million people who voted for her in the primaries to get behind Obama. Meanwhile, the Democratic National Committee unanimously voted to end sanctions against Florida and Michigan. The party initially stripped Florida and Michigan of their delegates for holding presidential primaries earlier than the party had wanted. However, in late May, the DNC's rules and bylaws committee voted to reinstate the delegates but give them each a half-vote. Sunday's decision gives the delegates a full vote at the convention. Ending the sanctions had been a goal of Clinton, who won Florida and Michigan in her unsuccessful bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. Obama endorsed lifting the sanctions after Clinton's withdrawal from the race. Between Monday's convention opening and Thursday night's acceptance speech by Obama at Denver's Invesco Field, delegates are expected to ratify his nomination and that of his vice presidential pick, Sen. Joseph Biden, another former primary rival. Obama faces Republican Sen. John McCain in November in the contest for the presidency. McCain's campaign has poked at the old Obama-Clinton splits with a campaign ad claiming Clinton was passed over for the No. 2 spot because she was too honest about Obama's perceived weaknesses. ""The truth hurt, and Obama didn't like it,"" McCain's ad says. But Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. of Illinois, an Obama supporter, told CBS' ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday: ""This campaign is not about Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton."" ""His campaign is about George Bush and four more years of George Bush under John McCain,"" Jackson said. ""That message is going to echo clearly from this platform."" A new CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll released Sunday night showed that Obama's lead over McCain has evaporated. Forty-seven percent of those questioned are backing Obama, with an equal amount supporting McCain. Taken after Biden's selection, the poll showed that the number of Clinton Democrats who said they would vote for McCain increased 11 points since June, enough to account for most of the support McCain gained. Clinton fared better than Obama among working-class voters in many states during the primaries. Obama on Sunday suggested the convention would help give those voters ""a sense of who I am."" Obama said he hopes voters will conclude that he is ""sort of like us. He [Obama] comes from a middle-class background. He went to school on scholarships, he had to pay off student loans. He and his wife had to worry about child care."" ""You'll find out: 'He's pretty much like us,'"" Obama told supporters about himself, while campaigning in Wisconsin on his way to Denver. Obama hammered at McCain on the economy and on McCain's perceived strong suit, national security. Obama told supporters at a barbecue in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, ""The Republican track record on national security has not been particularly good."" ""My job in this campaign is to explain that talking tough and acting dumb is not a way to keep you safe and secure,"" he said. ""We need somebody who talks tough, who's going to act smart and be tough. That's how we're going to look after the safety of the American people."" Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, viewed as a potential McCain running mate, said Obama's decision to pick Biden -- the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee -- was an acknowledgment that Obama lacked to national security chops to be president. ""I don't think he's ready to be president. And when you're commander-in-chief, you shouldn't be having to select a mentor to help you with that role,"" Pawlenty told CNN's ""Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer.""

"FORT COLLINS, Colorado (CNN) -- The Colorado couple accused of carrying out a bizarre hoax involving their son and a huge balloon is ""not running from the law"" and deserves the presumption of innocence, their attorney said Monday. Richard Heene has told reporters that a runaway balloon incident involving his son was ""absolutely no hoax."" ""The sheriff having a press conference saying that they're guilty does not make them so,"" David Lane told CNN's ""American Morning."" Authorities say the event -- in which the tearful couple claimed their 6-year-old may have been trapped in the flying-saucer-like contraption floating through the air -- was staged. Richard and Mayumi Heene had met in a Hollywood acting school and pursued fame for their family in the world of reality TV, Larimer County Sheriff Jim Alderden said. Lane, asked Monday by CNN about his client's state of mind, said it was ""what you would expect someone's state of mind to be after law enforcement searched your house, seized your property, held a press conference announcing you're about to be charged with felony criminal charges. Your state of mind would be rather upset and you would feel somewhat under siege, which is exactly how the family feels at this point.""  Watch how attorney says family is dealing with hoax allegations » . During the incident Thursday, as millions worldwide watched live TV coverage of the contraption floating above northern Colorado, authorities did not pick up on any deceptive behavior, Alderden said. But that night, during an interview with CNN's ""Larry King Live,"" the boy, Falcon, gave authorities an ""Aha! moment,"" Alderden said. ""You guys said we did this for the show,"" Falcon said in the interview, when his father asked him why he had not come out from hiding when his parents were looking for him.  Watch how boy explain balloon incident » . Richard and Mayumi Heene said their son was simply confused. But authorities enacted a ""game plan"" of getting the truth, Alderden said. The plan included misleading the media on Friday when Alderden said authorities still believed the incident was not a hoax. They wanted to keep the couple's trust, Alderden said. Investigators pursued separate interviews and polygraph tests with the Heene parents Saturday, then searched the couple's home early Sunday for computer records, phone records, video recordings, and other potential evidence, Alderden said. ""The sheriff put both of them on a box, and they have not shared with us whether or not they passed or failed,"" Lane told ""American Morning"" on Monday. Polygraphs are not admissible in court, Lane added. Alderden said that under Colorado law, authorities cannot announce whether polygraph tests were taken -- only that authorities pursued them. The sheriff, at Sunday's news conference, said the investigation was still under way and that charges would likely soon follow, including for several felonies: conspiracy, contributing to the delinquency of a minor and attempting to influence a public servant. The family will likely also be charged with filing a false police report, which is a misdemeanor, Alderden said. He added that authorities plan to seek restitution for the expenses incurred in the wild goose chase for Falcon. Since authorities aren't required to share evidence until charges are actually filed, Lane said he could not lay out the Heenes' defense. ""Until that point... I'm shooting in the dark,"" he said, adding, ""If they have probable cause to make an arrest, then make an arrest and give me the evidence."" iReport.com: ""Outraged"" over balloon hoax . Alderden, speaking at a news conference Sunday, said authorities are concerned about the safety of all three Heene children, ages 6, 8, and 10. Authorities spoke with Mayumi Heene about domestic violence and the children's safety, Alderden said. ""But we didn't have enough that would allow us or Child Protection Services to physically take the kids from that environment."" There was a 911 call from the home earlier this year that led authorities to a ""suspicious circumstance"" that Alderden said may have involved ""domestic violence, perhaps against the wife."" Lane told CNN affiliate KMGH on Sunday that he has ""no reason to believe they're anything but loving parents."" iReport.com: ""Balloon boy saga is symptom, not disease"" Speaking to CNN Monday, Lane said the Heene children had been in his office Sunday, and that by his own observations as a father of three, ""They seem to be perfectly, normal, happy, well-adjusted kids that are being insulated from this process as much as possible."" During a round of live TV interviews Friday morning, Falcon had been sick, which many speculate was because he was so upset over the incident. One of the questions that remains unanswered is where Falcon was as the balloon flew overhead. On Friday, Alderden said it had been determined that the boy was hiding in an attic in the garage. Now, authorities are unsure. Alderden said the boy may not have even been in the home.  Watch how boys was supposed to be in balloon » . The Heenes have previously appeared on the ABC program ""Wife Swap."" Richard Heene also chases storms, brings his family along and takes videos.

Heene has been described as a meteorologist, but his education ended at the high school level, Alderden said.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Science fiction author Ray Bradbury, whose imagination yielded classic books such as ""Fahrenheit 451,"" ""The Martian Chronicles"" and ""Something Wicked This Way Comes,"" has died at 91, his publisher said Wednesday. Bradbury was a writer of perils, possibilities and wonder . Bradbury ""died peacefully, last night, in Los Angeles, after a lengthy illness,"" HarperCollins said in a written statement. Bradbury's books and 600 short stories predicted a variety of things, including the emergence of ATMs and live broadcasts of fugitive car chases. Sci-fi legend Ray Bradbury on God, 'monsters and angels' ""In a career spanning more than 70 years, Ray Bradbury has inspired generations of readers to dream, think and create,"" the statement said. ""A prolific author of hundreds of short stories and close to 50 books, as well as numerous poems, essays, operas, plays, teleplays and screenplays, Bradbury was one of the most celebrated writers of our time."" Overheard on CNN.com: Ray Bradbury was 'very down to Earth,' or maybe Mars . Bradbury wrote the screenplay for John Huston's classic film adaptation of ""Moby Dick."" He adapted 65 of his stories for television's ""The Ray Bradbury Theater"" and won an Emmy for his teleplay of ""The Halloween Tree."" Top five Bradbury films . ""In my later years I have looked in the mirror each day and found a happy person staring back."" he wrote in a book of essays published in 2005. ""Occasionally I wonder why I can be so happy. The answer is that every day of my life I've worked only for myself and for the joy that comes from writing and creating. The image in my mirror is not optimistic, but the result of optimal behavior."" Favorite quotes from Bradbury's 'Fahrenheit 451' Bradbury's death brought immediate reaction from his literary and film peers, as well as the White House. ""For many Americans, the news of Ray Bradbury's death immediately brought to mind images from his work, imprinted in our minds, often from a young age,"" President Obama said. ""His gift for storytelling reshaped our culture and expanded our world.

"London (CNN) -- British archaeologists have discovered the 1,000-year-old boat burial of a Viking warrior in the Scottish Highlands. The man was laid to rest inside his boat, surrounded by valuable items including an ornately-decorated sword, a shield, a spear and an ax -- all of which suggest he was of high status. Experts say the find -- the first fully intact grave of its kind on the UK mainland -- may be part of one of the country's most significant Viking sites. ""A Viking boat burial is an incredible discovery,"" said project co-director and archaeologist Dr Hannah Cobb, from the University of Manchester. ""But in addition to that, the artifacts and preservation make this one of the most important Norse graves ever excavated in Britain."" Archaeologists from several universities have spent the past six years carrying out digs at a number sites on the remote Ardnamurchan Peninsula, on Scotland's west coast. They are aiming to trace the whole history of the area, from the first traces of human habitation 6,000 years ago to the present. Previous excavations nearby have uncovered a Neolithic tomb, a Bronze Age monument, and a 19th century site linked to the Highland Clearances. But Dr Oliver Harris of the University of Leicester, one of the project's leaders, said the boat burial was ""the best of the bunch."" ""It's absolutely fantastic -- the find of a lifetime,"" he told CNN. ""It is very rich, very old, the sort of thing I dreamed of excavating as a boy."" Other grave goods found with the Viking included a knife, flints, a bronze ring pin from Ireland, a whetstone from Norway, and items of pottery from the Hebrides. The team also excavated hundreds of metal rivets, which would have held together the Viking's boat -- the wood of which had rotted away over the centuries. Harris said the objects gave tantalizing clues to the identity of the man buried at Ardnamurchan. ""Of course, we will never know his name, or anything like that, but we can tell he was an important figure, a man of very high status, and somebody with international connections, links to lots of different places, but also to the local area,"" he said. The archaeologist said he and the rest of the team planned to return to the site again next summer to carry out further investigations. ""This was just one burial, but it is part of a much larger story,"" he said. ""There are many more questions to answer. We want to find out if there are others, or if people were living in settlements nearby, so we will be back there next year.""","Viking boat burial found at Ardnamurchan in the Scottish Highlands .

"(CNN) -- Joe Palese took his first yoga class in the 1990s, right as the practice began gaining in popularity in the United States. ""They didn't even have any yoga mats,"" he said, recalling the New York sports club that offered the class. It wasn't until Palese started taking classes at yoga studios that he realized a lot of the previous sessions were ""watered down"" versions of yoga. The loose interpretation wasn't bothersome; yoga by definition is a diverse practice with more than a dozen different styles. But as Palese remembers, some of the poses the inexperienced teachers were demonstrating were simply not right. ""The instructors were cool people, and they'd play good music, but students didn't know they were being taught poorly,"" said Palese, who became a yoga instructor himself 14 years ago. And, according to author and New York Times science writer William J. Broad, some of the common yoga poses can cause serious injuries like nerve damage, torn cartilage, and strokes, among others. An article adapted from Broad's upcoming book on yoga featured in the New York Times Sunday Magazine earlier this month with the title ""How Yoga Can Wreck Your Body,"" sparked a lively debate within the yoga community about how to keep practitioners safe. In the article, Broad noted that yoga is a ""free-for-all"" with ""no hierarchy of officials or organization to ensure purity and adhere to agreed-upon sets of facts and poses, rules and procedures, outcomes and benefits."" Broad is correct -- there isn't a government oversight committee dedicated to yoga practice. And that's because many practitioners prefer it that way. ""Yoga comes from India. Things are not uniform by tradition,"" said Gyandev McCord, who has taught yoga for 25 years. In an effort to provide a common ground for the diverse practice of yoga, a group of seasoned yoga practitioners -- ""yogis"" -- came together in 1999 to form the Yoga Alliance, a nonprofit organization whose sole purpose is to create minimum standards for yoga teacher training. Fearing government or insurance companies might step in and start calling the shots, the alliance set forth to self-regulate, said McCord, who is the co-founder and vice chairman of the organization. It is for yogis, by yogis. After all, McCord said, those ""who don't understand the landscape of yoga aren't qualified"" to regulate the standards for teaching. Anyone trained by schools registered with the Yoga Alliance completes 200 or 500 hours of training, based on the following five principles: yoga techniques, including poses, breathing and meditation; general teaching methodology; anatomy and physiology; yoga philosophy and ethics; and training, practicum, and supervised teaching, in which senior instructors observe trainees to identify and correct any issues. McCord said the five principles allow for ""a lot of wiggle room,"" and aim to protect and promote the teacher's individuality. Once trained, the instructors are certified by their school and their names are listed on a registry that informs the public of teachers in their area who have completed the minimum standards for yoga instruction. Yoga Alliance-trained teachers may also use the trademarked ""RYT"" -- registered yoga teacher -- behind their name, indicating they've completed the required hours. Not all members of the yoga community are on board with this approach, however. Leslie Kaminoff, co-founder of the Breathing Project, a nonprofit that provides continuing education to yoga practitioners, disagrees with yoga regulation of any kind. He believes in a free market approach to regulations for yoga teacher training. ""Yoga is about freedom,"" he said, ""The market place is the ultimate quality control."" Yoga instruction, he said, is about a relationship between a teacher and a student. If a teacher is trained to teach yoga on the Internet or by a DVD at home and the student is fine with it, it's really nobody's business. McCord said he has no problem with that approach. ""It's not illegal to teach without training as a teacher,"" he said. But Palese is more wary. He believes that learning how to align properly is something that needs an ""expert eye,"" one that can't be achieved by watching a DVD. ""Anyone can tell you what to do, it's explaining how to do it,"" he said. And that is what separates effective teachers from the rest, according to Palese. ""It's alignment with awareness,"" he said. Palese trains teachers at a studio where he teaches in suburban Atlanta. His 200-hour training class meets one weekend a month for 10 months, a long stretch of time imperative to the teaching process. ""You need time for information to settle,"" Palese said. Since yoga instruction is far more complex than just leading students to do poses, Palese said he reserves the right to extend the training past 10 months if needed. He wants to give his new teachers whatever time they need to assimilate the information so that they can feel confident teaching others. ""It's the integrity and the awareness that the teacher brings to class that is most important,"" Palese said. Palese said successful teachers are committed to the safety for their students and will provide suggestions for modification, as well as props like belts, blankets and blocks to make those modifications. A willingness to adapt the practice for different audiences and environments helps too. ""I've taught yoga in the oddest of places,"" he said. Good teachers ""can teach yoga in an auditorium, a prison, a hospital."" They ""can transform the whole thing just by who they are.""","A recent New York Times Magazine article created shock waves in the yoga community .

"Washington (CNN) -- Republicans are taking aim at America's oldest senior citizens group, AARP, in the wake of a GOP-authored report that they contend exposed ""the conflict between AARP's drive for profits, the best interests of its members and the organization's tax-exempt status."" Democrats counter that the attacks are based on the organization's support of President Obama's health care reform bill. ""The facts suggest that AARP has strayed from its core mission,"" Rep. Wally Herger, R-California, chairman of the House Ways and Means' health subcommittee, said at a hearing Friday. He was one of those who released the report, titled ""Behind the Veil: the AARP America Doesn't Know,"" this week. ""The facts show that AARP no longer operates like a seniors advocacy organization. Instead it more closely resembles a for-profit insurance company,"" he said. Herger's subcommittee is now challenging AARP's tax-exempt nonprofit status, looking into how the AARP does business and pointing to the organization's profits from the sale of insurance and other products. The organization made nearly a third of its $1.4 billion budget through insurance sales in 2009, American Public Radio's Gregory Warner told the panel Friday. Rep. Charles Boustany, R-Louisiana, also argued Friday that the AARP has strayed from its original mission of protecting seniors. ""Contributions to the AARP Foundation between 2002 and 2009 grew by only 11%, or about $3.1 million. And funding of the legal counsel for the elderly actually decreased by about 9%,"" Boustany said. ""The parts of AARP that fulfill its original purpose seem not to be sharing in the bounty that has come to AARP from its insurance-related business activities."" Democrats counter by pointing out that Republicans welcomed AARP's 2003 support of the GOP push for Medicare reform, saying there were no such questions or hearings back then. Some members called the hearing ""political payback"" for AARP's support of Obama's health care reform efforts. ""We should see this for what it is,"" said Rep. Pete Stark, D-California, ""a waste of government time, and a vindictive attempt to settle a political score."" The hearing ""amounts to nothing more than a political witch hunt to punish an organization that spoke out in favor of health reform,"" he said, adding that the Republicans aim is ""to discredit AARP in the minds of seniors."" ""Before they announce a budget that will devastate Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid, they would like to silence AARP,"" Stark said. Barry Rand, AARP'S CEO, told committee members that the organization has been nothing but transparent, in contrast to the ""Behind the Veil"" report's implication that the organization had an ulterior motive for supporting health care reform. The report concluded that the AARP stands ""to make upwards of $1 billion over the next 10 years as a result of the new health care law through the sale of their endorsed-Medicare insurance products,"" according to a news release from Herger this week announcing the release of the report. ""We post on our website our annual reports, financial statements, IRS Form 990 tax returns and detailed breakdowns of our revenues and expenditures,"" Rand said. ""This is why we are surprised and disappointed both by the title and substance of the report."" He said there is no veil and the organization disagrees with all of the conclusions reached in the ""one-sided report."" ""First, we reject the allegation that our public policy positions are influenced by our revenues. Our policy positions are set by our all-volunteer board of directors based on the needs of our 50-plus population,"" he added. And Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr., D-New Jersey, noted that ""the sixth-largest social welfare organization"" with the type of nonprofit classification AARP has ""is a tax-exempt race track and casino which operates in Iowa."" ""I'm sure you'll help me understand why a race track and a casino are more deserving of this classification, because that's what you're getting at,"" he said. Former GOP Rep. Billy Tauzin, once the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, admits that attacking the AARP is risky. ""A perceived attack on AARP could easily backfire, giving Democrats an opportunity they could quickly use to paint themselves as the party best positioned to protect seniors in the future,"" he wrote in a Politico opinion piece. ""At the end of the day, I suspect AARP is likely to meet any reasonable test for non-profit status,"" he added. ""After all, it has no stock, pays no dividends and uses the profits it makes from sales and licensing to fund tax-exempt programs which assist seniors.""

"(CNN) -- ""What good does it do to be able to eat at a lunch counter if you can't buy a hamburger?"" Martin Luther King Jr. asked almost 50 years ago. As we celebrate King's birthday, recall the historic struggle for equality and reflect on the progress we've made, we can't forget that a basic tenet of the movement King represented was one of economic security. For millions of American women and their families -- especially women of color -- the aspiration of equal rights coupled with full economic opportunity is far from realized. On MLK Day, helping the unemployed is a moral issue . Today, one in three Americans lives at or below the poverty line, and almost 70% are women and children. That's 42 million women inching along poverty's tightrope. The number of working poor struggling to lift themselves into the middle class is steadily increasing, with the worst poverty rates falling on black and Latina women. A new report just released, The Shriver Report: A Woman's Nation Pushes Back from the Brink, illuminates this economic plight that is seizing millions of American women but is frequently overlooked in our national discussions about poverty and inequality. Women represent nearly two-thirds of minimum wage workers, concentrated in jobs that tend to be labor-intensive. They go without paid sick days or access to affordable child care. Moreover, women across the spectrum continue to earn less than men no matter the education level, profession or position -- a wage gap that is more like a gulf for women of color who earn 55 to 65 cents on the dollar compared with white men. To fight poverty, start with women . Add to this picture that 40% of our nation's households with children rely on women as a primary or sole source of income, and it becomes easier to understand why it is so hard for many families to get ahead. What's clear is that the American family has changed. No longer are we a ""Leave It to Beaver"" nation. Only one in five families today has a parent in the workforce and another who stays at home with the kids. Women are increasingly primary breadwinner and primary caregiver, and the nation has not kept pace with this reality. Our approach to families, in public policy and in the workplace, is decidedly 20th century. We need to push forward a 21st century policy agenda that acknowledges women are playing these critical dual roles. The greatest MLK speeches you have never heard . For starters, it's past time we adopt nationwide paid family leave and paid sick day policies -- now standard in most developed countries -- so that women don't have to make the impossible choice between providing needed family care and feeding the family. We also need to close the gender wage gap, which would cut the poverty rate in half for working women and their families and add nearly a half trillion dollars to the national economy. Raising the minimum wage would provide women who labor in jobs caring for others' families with greater economic resources to care for their own. Access to quality, affordable child care not only allows mothers to work all year, it also gives them the chance to further their education, which is a key gateway to the middle class. Legislation has been proposed in Congress on all of these issues, so the time to act is now. As we chart the course for the next generation of change, addressing the economic crisis facing women -- particularly low-income women and women of color -- must be front and center. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Maya L. Harris.","On MLK Day, Maya Harris argues that economic justice for women is key today .

"(CNN) -- Late to work this morning? Forget those excuses about traffic jams and Halloween hangovers. You might be able to blame your iPhone. Reports from Europe suggest a bug in the iPhone's alarm app caused it not to adjust to the end of Daylight Saving Time in that part of the world. Consequently, people in Europe were tweeting like crazy about waking up an hour late because of the apparent bug. ""A whole hour of peace and quiet in the office this morning without any iPhone users courtesy of Apple,"" wrote a Twitter user named jamiei.. A user named garrettc wrote: ""Daddy, do you remember where you were during the great iphone alarm calamity of 2010?"" ""No son, I was asleep"" Daylight Saving Time ended on Sunday in Europe, causing clocks to reset to an hour earlier. Reports suggest recurring iPhone alarms did not adjust to the new time. The time change does not go into effect until November 7 in the United States and no alarm-clock problems have been reported here. Earlier in October, websites in Australia reported an iPhone software bug caused alarms to go off an hour earlier than expected. The blog Engadget writes about a way to trick your alarm into going off at the correct time: . ""Deleting and re-adding the alarms will NOT fix the issue. We've now tested a number of scenarios under iOS 4.1 for ourselves. The bug appears when using a repeating alarm for anything other than 'every day.' So for example, your alarm will go off an hour late if it's set for 'weekdays' or 'weekends' or every 'Monday.' The following alarms are not affected by the bug: . ""An alarm that doesn't repeat (repeat set to 'never') An alarm set to repeat 'every day'"" The blog TheNextWeb says Apple should announce a software fix: . ""We imagine Apple engineers will be working overtime to get this fixed before daylight saving time hits the USA next weekend."" Apple did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment. The glitch highlights what appears to be a trend of people using their phones to wake themselves up in the morning -- instead of using traditional alarm clocks. That may not come as a surprise since people seem to use their phones to do almost everything these days -- from browsing the Web to planning pregnancy.

"(CNN) -- The United States is an exceptional country. On this, almost all U.S. politicians agree. And millions of Americans, do too, according to recent polls. More than three centuries after John Winthrop first preached that the new Massachusetts Bay colony would be a ""city upon a hill,"" Presidents John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan both reiterated his admonition that ""the eyes of all people are upon us."" For President Barack Obama, the United States is ""not just a place on a map, but the light to the world."" This broad agreement on American exceptionalism is often overlooked. This is especially so for conservatives, who now demand allegiance to the idea and chastise Obama, despite all evidence to the contrary, for not believing sufficiently in the exceptional nature of the country he leads. Exceptionalism is a flashpoint in American politics today not because the claim is contested, but because conservatives and liberals hold differing views of what makes the United States exceptional. These differences are at the core of our current fights over foreign policy. Conservatives believe the United States is exceptional because its people are inherently good. And we are. By and large, Americans are upstanding, moral individuals who instinctively support noble policies in our relations with other countries. Nonetheless, conservatives are much more likely than liberals to believe that American values and culture are superior to those of other nations. In a recent Pew Research Center poll, 63% of conservatives believe our culture is superior to others, compared with just 45% for moderates and 34% for liberals. Although the decline in overall support for this view of cultural superiority from 60% in 2002 to only 49% today received the headline attention, the dispersion across political ideologies is perhaps even more important. For conservatives compared with liberals, American exceptionalism rests in large part on a belief in the country's superior culture and values. This conservative version of ""America the exceptional"" was on full display among the Republican candidates in the recent CNN debate on foreign policy. Conservatives expect other countries to recognize the inherent goodness of the American people and the foreign policies produced by our government, and to accept our international leadership because of our self-evident virtue. Indeed, many conservatives call for a foreign policy that is free of constraints by the United Nations or other multilateral institutions precisely because they believe accommodating the desires of other countries would limit our ability to act on our goodness. It is striking that the most avid proponents of an assertive unilateralism in which other countries are expected to trust us -- and our government -- simply because we are good are the same conservatives who so distrust government at home. In the words of Reagan, endorsed by all the current major Republican candidates, ""government is the problem, not the solution."" In relations with other countries, however, many conservatives argue that the goodness of the United States will be translated directly into action. Economic or social policy at home may be distorted and even captured by ""special interests,"" but foreign policy remains pure and reflects the high morals of the American people. How government can be ""the problem"" in domestic policy and untainted in its actions toward others is never addressed. Liberals see the United States as exceptional because of our principles of limited government, embedded in the Constitution. Accepting that inherently good Americans often have different ideas of what goodness means, liberals celebrate our system of checks and balances. Although few liberals believe in the cultural superiority of the American people, 73% of Democrats in a 2010 USA Today/Gallup poll believe that its ""history and its Constitution"" make the United States ""the greatest country in the world."" This is the view of American exceptionalism held by Obama. As he stated in a 2009 news conference in Strasbourg, France, ""I think we have a core set of values that are enshrined in our Constitution, in our body of law, in our democratic practices, in our belief in free speech and equality, that, though imperfect, are exceptional."" Contemporary liberals support a larger, more activist role for government at home and abroad because they trust that the competing branches of government will limit the influence of what James Madison called ""factions."" Expecting the government to usually ""do the right thing"" because of its institutional constraints, liberals are more comfortable giving it a larger role in our lives. Liberals extend the principles of limited government to the international arena. Believing that a leader needs followers, and that followers will only follow if the leader can be trusted, liberals embrace multilateralism. It is only by creating opportunities for other countries to voice their preferences and to shape American policy through joint decision-making that other countries will accept the unique leadership status of the United States, they believe. In this view, the United States can and should welcome limits on its freedom of action abroad -- just as it does at home. According to the Pew Research Center poll, 57% of liberals believe the United States should get United Nations approval before using military force, while only 38% of conservatives say this is an important step. These competing views of exceptionalism mean that too often Americans talk past one another. Although most of us agree that the United States is exceptional, we do so for very different reasons. Exceptionalism has become a conservative trope, a rhetorical tool with which to challenge the nationalism of liberals. Focusing more on values, a strong majority of Republicans in the Gallup poll report that they do not believe Obama thinks the United States is exceptional, whereas an overwhelming majority of Democrats believe he does. Rather than painting liberals as unpatriotic, conservatives should hold up a mirror to their own view and reflect on the contradiction. How they can believe that the will of the people is always distorted at home but flawlessly translated into policy abroad is, well, exceptional. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David A. Lake.","Belief that America is an exceptional country is widely shared in the U.S.

"Washington (CNN) -- Hakimullah Mehsud, a key leader of the Pakistani Taliban, has been charged for his alleged involvement in the killings of seven U.S. citizens at an American military base in Afghanistan in 2009, the U.S. Justice Department announced Wednesday. A $5 million reward is being offered for information leading to the capture of Mehsud and another top Pakistani Taliban leader, Wali Ur Rehman, U.S. officials announced. A complaint listed two criminal charges against Mehsud. ""We support any lawful means to hold this terrorist accountable for what he's done,"" CIA spokesman George Little said Wednesday. ""The announcement today is part of that."" A U.S. official said the criminal charges are meant to deal with Hakimullah if he's captured, and added, ""He can face justice in other ways, too. That hasn't changed."" The ""in other ways"" comment was a backhanded reference to CIA Predator missile strikes in Pakistan, which have killed a number of suspected al Qaeda terrorists and other extremists. The group -- which was declared a terrorist organization by the United States -- is believed to be responsible for terrorist acts, including the December 30, 2009, suicide attack on a CIA base in Afghanistan and the attempted Times Square bombing earlier this year. A criminal complaint unsealed Wednesday details the U.S. government's case against Mehsud. All the victims were killed by a suicide bomber, a Jordanian national named Humam Khalil Abu Mulal al-Balawi, at a U.S. base near Khost, Afghanistan. The attack killed five CIA officers, two private military contractors working for the CIA, and a member of Jordanian intelligence. Also killed was the base chief, Jennifer Matthews, a 45-year-old mother of three. U.S. officials believe Mehsud was working with al-Balawi in planning the attack as well as planning the failed bombing attack in Times Square in May. The counts against Mehsud include conspiracy to murder a United States national while outside the United States and conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction against a national of the United States while outside the United States. Mehsud is believed to be the commander of Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, which a U.S. official described as a ""Taliban-inspired alliance of Pakistan-based Sunni tribal militants."" The group claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing as well as the failed attempt to bomb New York's Times Square. FBI Investigators are piecing together their case based on interviews with survivors of the Afghan attack and details gleaned by combing through personal items left behind by the victims. It is believed that al-Balawi was working with Jordanian intelligence as a double agent, offering information to Jordanian and U.S. intelligence officials on the aftermath of drone attacks while garnering enough support and trust to carry out the suicide attack. Witnesses told investigators that Al-Balawi was welcomed on the base in December before he exited the right side of the vehicle, reached under his clothing and detonated the device he had strapped to his body. After the attack, a previously recorded video was released of Mehsud and al-Balawi together talking about the attack. The U.S. government listed the Pakistani Taliban as a foreign terrorist organization, indicating its intent on going after terrorists one way or another. ""We have no higher priority than bringing to justice terrorists who kill Americans serving and working abroad,"" said U.S. Attorney Ronald C. Machen, Jr. in a news release. ""We will continue to use every tool at our disposal to seek justice for the victims of this heinous arrack."" Complaints generally list the address of the accused. In this case, the accused's address reads ""Federally Administered Tribal Area of Pakistan."" And therein lies a problem. Serving an arrest warrant against a suspected terrorist living in the tribal areas will be difficult. But the United States has added a financial incentive by offering the $5 million reward for information leading to the capture of Mehsud and Ur Rehman, another leader of the group. CNN's Pam Benson contributed to this story.","Hakimullah Mehsud linked to deaths of 7 in 2009 at Afghan base .

"Schonau, Germany (CNN) -- A former teacher with no formal business qualifications, Ursula Sladek cuts an unusual figure as the head of a major electricity company. But then her company, the Schonau Power Supply (EWS) -- based in the hills of a remote German town -- is not your typical electricity supplier. Founded by Sladek and a few friends in 1991, EWS is a citizen-owned co-operative that powers 120,000 homes across Germany, using only sustainable energy supplies. Today, following the nuclear explosion in Fukushima and Germany's subsequent commitment to end its reliance on nuclear power over the next decade, EWS is enjoying rocketing demand, and expects to provide for a million homes by 2015. Not bad for a self-professed housewife, who wrest control of her local electricity grid from the nationwide energy provider. Sladek's story starts in 1986, in the wake of the Chernobyl disaster. Although her home in Schonau was over 2,000 kilometers away from the nuclear plant explosion, traces of radiation had still managed to infect the local wildlife. ""At first we thought: What can the children eat? Can they play outdoors,"" she recalls. ""And we still have this now, when you go into the forest, the mushrooms are still polluted; the wild boar is still polluted ... 25 years after Chernobyl, that is still here."" Sladek, a mother of five, established ""Parents for a Nuclear Free Future"" -- a regional organization aimed at promoting alternatives to nuclear energy. At the time, Sladek believed that KWR, the power company responsible for providing her town with its electricity, could be persuaded to invest in sustainable supplies and even help its people reduce their reliance on the grid. She was wrong. ""They told us: 'You want to save energy? We sell energy. That's our job. We'll not help you.' We learned that neither the government nor the energy supplier would do anything."" It was exactly this response that spurred Sladek and others living in Schonau into what they did next. ""We never thought about overtaking a grid and doing what we're now doing,"" says Sladek. ""Their attitude was the reason why we wanted to."" And so, when KWR's licence to operate the power grid came up for renewal in 1991, Sladek and her group created their own power-company and launched a local petition to convince the town council and the population to let them manage it cooperatively. After many years and battles, in 1997, EWS had raised enough money -- about â‚¬2 million -- to buy the contract to supply Schonau with non-nuclear electricity. Collectively owned by 1,000 citizens, the company gets all its energy from green sources, mainly hydropower operations, but also including solar panels and wind turbines. Some homes even have small co-generation systems that produce domestic heat as well as electricity that can be sold back to the grid. So do EWS customers pay a premium to keep a clean and green conscience? Nope. In fact, according to Sladek, they pay less. ""We're offering (electricity) even cheaper than companies which supply their customers with nuclear power or with coal power,"" she says. ""That is because we don't want to gain as much money as the others do. Of course, we have to gain money as well because we have people who work for us ... But we just don't want to gain as much ... that's not the reason why we do (it)."" Indeed, the company's shareholders receive small dividends, as well as an income from any home-generated power they put back into the grid, but the rest is reinvested into new renewable energy projects and into training and supporting communities who want to run their own green energy companies. It's for these reasons that Sladek was named European winner of the 2011 Goldman Environmental prize, often cited as the ""Nobel for the environment,"" in April of this year. Not many energy barons can boast one of those.","Ursula Sladek created Germany's first co-op-owned renewable power company .

"(CNN) -- Opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline, which would move crude oil from the Alberta oil sands in Canada to refineries on the Gulf Coast if approved by President Barack Obama, has long relied on questionable information about our project and the Canadian oil sands. A CNN op-ed by Tom Steyer has made some claims that need to be disputed. He and other opponents insist oil transported by Keystone XL is destined for export. Nothing could be further from the truth. The reality, as TransCanada Corp. CEO Russ Girling has said, is not a drop of the oil transported through Keystone would be exported -- period. When he was asked at a news conference whether Keystone oil would be exported, Girling said: ""Not a chance. Not in my lifetime. I have talked to every one of our customers, both producers and refiners, I've asked them the question again: 'Do you have any intent of shipping any of this crude oil offshore?' And the answer is absolutely not."" Opponents also say the pipeline is not safe for the environment, but the undeniable reality is the science demonstrating Keystone XL is a safe and environmentally responsible project. The State Department's final supplemental environmental impact statement is a culmination of more than five years and contains 20,000 pages of analysis, with input from more than two dozen state and federal agencies. The environmental and market issues have been exhaustively reviewed and concerns debunked. The impact statement explicitly states that building Keystone XL is unlikely to significantly impact the rate of extraction in the oil sands based on expected oil prices, oil-sands supply costs, transport costs and supply-demand scenarios. Nor will Keystone XL affect ""the continued demand for heavy crude oil at refineries in the United States ..."" And when it comes to producing heavy crude, the State Department impact statement recognizes that only oil sands production trends downward on carbon intensity. Canada emits just 2% of global greenhouse gases, and the emissions from oil sands contribute 0.16% to global emissions. For context, three coal-fired power plants in the United States emit more greenhouse gases than the entire oil sands industry. With regard to rail, the impact statement was abundantly clear that the expansion of rail facilities will be able to transport the capacity of Keystone XL and then some. Nearly 1.2 million barrels per day of rail loading capacity, about 1.5 times the size of Keystone XL, will be available to move Canadian crude oil to markets by the end of 2015. The latest U.S. Energy Information Agency energy forecast shows the United States will import millions of barrels of oil for decades during its transition to a lower carbon future. The responsible thing to do for the environment, the economy and the public is to build the safest, most efficient infrastructure to transport it. At TransCanada, we're investing billions of dollars in renewable and emission-less energy sources in North America, including wind, solar, hydro and nuclear power to bring clean energy to millions of homes across the continent. We're also focused on upgrading U.S. energy infrastructure so that during the transition, the United States can get more of its oil from a trusted ally: Canada. That's the responsible path forward and why Keystone XL continues to enjoy strong public, congressional, labor and business support -- and why this project continues to be in the United States' national interest. We urge Obama to give a green light to the Keystone. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Alexander J. Pourbaix.","Alexander Pourbaix says opponents are wrong on Keystone XL pipeline .

"(CNN) -- I wear the burqa for the simple reason that I am a Muslim and the Koran says that I must wear the full veil in order to be modest. I am proud of my Muslim faith and my modesty. I am proud to follow God's law. Nobody ever forced me to wear the full veil and I have been wearing it for around 10 years now. In fact, very few of my friends actually wear one. There are, of course, situations in which some men force their wives or daughters to wear the burqa but, believe me, these cases are a very, very small minority. For those of us who are believers, we just want to do God's will and live by the sacred text, so what any man says has nothing to do with that. I am testament to that as I don't have a husband and I practice my religion freely, that's why I'm always shocked when people say it's the husband who forces his wife to wear a burqa. It is actually the case that a lot of men in France do not wish their wives to wear the full veil because when they go out, they are insulted or attacked and their husbands don't want them to be put in that situation. I first started wearing the full veil when I was a teenager but I stopped for a while because when you're young, you don't want to be set apart, you want to look like everyone else. But later after seeing what was happening with terrorist attacks involving Muslims all over the world, I decided to become more conscious and find out more about my faith. In the process, I found myself becoming more spiritual and decided to start wearing the burqa. Now, my liberty is being threatened with this law proposed by the French government. If this law is passed, it will be a great injustice. It is very unfair that they are even considering this law. Perhaps the French authorities are terrified that women will start dressing like this, despite evidence to the contrary. Why am I, as a Muslim woman, targeted unfairly, when there are less than 2,000 of us in France who wear the burqa? Where is my freedom of clothing or expression? France prides itself as a country that upholds the rights of man but where are my rights? Why am I not free to wear what I want? Many cite security reasons because they can't tell who is under the veil. But myself and a lot of women who wear the burqa are always happy to identify ourselves when asked. In the past, I have taken off my veil when it is asked of me -- as long as it's a woman who does it. My religion demands that I cover my face in front of any man who is not either my brother, father or husband. I have been wearing the veil in France for years and it has never been a problem, I use public transport like everyone else and I've never had any problems. Although, it can be quite strange when I'm on a bus for example and people say to me: 'You poor thing, we feel sorry for you.' And I wonder exactly why they feel sorry for me. I'm very happy wearing the veil and it makes me spiritually fulfilled as I'm practicing my religion, so I don't really see it as anything to pity me for. I really believe that France is scared of Muslims, which is the motivation for this law, but people shouldn't generalize as not all Muslims are the same. Yes, some have done terrible things, but it is done in the name of man, never in the name of God. I, as a French Muslim woman, have nothing but love in my heart towards all people. And whatever the outcome, if France succeeds in banning the veil on its streets, I will never take mine off. My freedom means a lot to me and if this law is passed, I would rather move to another country where I can worship in peace. I obey the laws of God not the laws of man.

"DONGSHIGU VILLAGE, China (CNN) -- As Christian Bale approached an impromptu checkpoint leading to this tiny village in eastern China, four men blocking the narrow path started marching toward him in menacing unison. ""I am here to see Chen Guangcheng,"" the ""Dark Knight"" actor said and I translated, with correspondent Stan Grant and cameraman Brad Olson next to us. ""Go away!"" the plainclothes guards barked, pushing us back. Amid the scuffling and yelling, dozens more guards in olive-green, military-style overcoats -- and two gray minivans -- emerged from the other side of the checkpoint, all coming toward us. ""Why can I not visit this free man?"" Bale asked repeatedly, only to receive punches from guards aiming for his small camera as they tried to drag him away from the rest of us. As we retreated, I recognized the ringleader -- the same burly man who had hurled rocks at the CNN team 10 months earlier to force us out of the same location. A precarious scene ensued Thursday as one of the gray minivans chased our car at high speed on bumpy country roads for some 40 minutes. When the dust settled, we counted a broken car, a damaged camera -- and a Hollywood star disappointed at -- but not shocked by -- his failure to see a personal hero. ""What I really wanted to do was to meet the man, shake his hand and say what an inspiration he is,"" Bale said. The man, 40-year-old Chen Guangcheng, has been confined to his home along with his wife, mother and daughter, and watched around the clock by dozens of guards since he was released from prison in September 2010. A local court had sentenced him to more than four years in prison for damaging property and disrupting traffic in a protest. Blind China activist recovers amid call for his release . His supporters maintain authorities used trumped-up charges to silence Chen, a blind, self-taught lawyer who rose to fame in the late 1990s thanks to his legal advocacy for what he called victims of abusive practices by China's family-planning officials. Bale first learned about Chen through news reports, including our coverage in February, when he was in China filming ""The Flowers of War,"" a wartime drama set in 1930s Nanjing in which he plays a mortician trying to save a group of schoolgirls from the clutches invading Japanese soldiers. Blind lawyer makes Chinese officials jittery . The injustice faced by the activist and his family stirred such strong emotions in Bale that, upon hearing his impending return to China to promote the movie, he decided to do something unusual to raise the international awareness of Chen and thereby to turn up the heat on the Chinese government. ""This doesn't come naturally to me, this is not what I actually enjoy -- it isn't about me,"" he explained during our eight-hour drive from Beijing to the eastern city of Linyi, where Chen's village is located. ""But this was just a situation that said I can't look the other way."" Known to be a media-shy celebrity, Bale reached out to CNN and invited us to join him on his journey to visit Chen. In the car, he lamented the American public's lack of knowledge on Chen's case, despite senior U.S. officials' increasingly vocal support for his freedom. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Gary Locke, the American ambassador to China, have both championed Chen's cause. Bale appeared a little surprised to learn that Relativity Media, which produced his 2010 Oscar-winning ""The Fighter"" and recently filmed a comedy in Linyi, was accused by activists of cozying up to the same officials who ordered Chen's detention and torture. The studio has issued a statement denying the allegation. Although China's state media has largely ignored the story, Chen's plight has spread online and outraged a growing number of Chinese ""netizens."" Many have tried to visit Chen, and activists say nearly all would-be visitors have been turned back, often violently, by plainclothes police and local thugs. ""I'm not brave doing this,"" Bale emphasized. ""The local people who are standing up to the authorities, who are visiting Chen and his family and getting beaten or detained, I want to support them."" As our car sped toward Beijing in the dark, Bale wondered aloud if he would never be allowed back -- a prospect he is prepared to accept -- even as ""The Flowers of War"" became China's official entry into next year's Academy Awards. ""Really, what else can I do to help Chen?"" he kept asking as the clock struck midnight, with his latest movie -- partially funded by the state -- about to open nationwide in China.","Christian Bale is in China to promote a new movie filmed there .

"South Hadley, Massachusetts (CNN) -- As a co-author of an American history textbook that was effectively banned in Texas eight years ago, I get a strong feeling of déjà vu all over again as I follow the state's latest curricular wars. Historians and teachers have reason to be deeply concerned over the latest actions taken by the Texas Board of Education regarding social studies curriculum standards. The board has moved aggressively to put its hard-right conservative stamp on what students need to learn about the American past. Among the changes made by the board was the elimination of Thomas Jefferson from a list of thinkers who had inspired revolutions around the world. Conservatives object to Jefferson's support for a clear separation of church and state. This trend is troubling in terms of the writing and the teaching of U.S. history. In 2002, the school board, egged on by well-funded conservative organizations, excluded ""Out of Many: A History of the American People,"" ostensibly for an offensive passage discussing prostitution on the Western frontier. But the real reason became clear as that dispute played out, and I think that it helps explain what's happening today. Many conservatives are simply unwilling to accept how much the writing and teaching of American history has changed over the past 40 years. They want an American history that ignores or marginalizes African-Americans, women, Latinos, immigrants and popular culture. Rather than genuinely engaging the fundamental conflicts that have shaped our past, they prefer a celebratory history that denies those fundamental conflicts. Conservative textbook activists believe that somehow what they call the ""revisionist"" history of recent decades needs to be ""balanced."" Hence their insistence that, for example, textbooks stress the superiority of American ""free enterprise"" -- they think the word ""capitalism"" is too negative. And they insist books stress, as school board chairman Don McLeroy put it, that ""America was built on Biblical ideals."" What's wrong with this picture? For one thing, the process itself undermines the hard work, research and professional judgments of teachers and outside experts who toil to come up with a coherent curriculum. This year, the Texas board approved more than 100 amendments to the 120-page curriculum standards affecting history, sociology and economic classes. Instead of acknowledging that genuine disagreements over interpretation and emphasis are the lifeblood of history, they reduce it all to a cartoonish process of correcting perceived ""bias."" This is a terrible trivialization of history, contributing to the dumbing-down of what students learn. If we want to equip our students with analytical skills, the tools that allow them to become critical thinkers and better citizens, then we need to expose them to a greater variety of often conflicting sources: primary documents, biographies, monographs, films and so on. We need to acknowledge there's no such thing as history with a capital H. There are only individual men and women who struggle to make sense of some aspect of the past, bringing our own passions, preconceptions and points of view to our writing. American history looks a great deal more inclusive, capacious, contentious and messy than it did a half century ago. That is because contemporary events always affect how we understand the past. Thus, the civil rights movement led to an explosion of innovative and groundbreaking scholarship on African-American history. Similarly, there was very little attention to the historical experiences of women before the feminist upsurge of the 1970s. The antiwar movement and New Left of the 1960s and '70s prompted major reconsideration of the history of American foreign relations. The environmentalist movement has inspired a broad rethinking of the nation's relationship to the land and natural resources. Much recent historical writing has confronted some of the more painful and difficult aspects of our past, such as the grim realities of American apartheid and the powerful influence of white supremacist thinking. But does this sort of work somehow demean America, as conservative critics charge? Perhaps, if your goal is to reduce the study and teaching of history to a kind of pseudo-patriotic cheerleading. But I believe we have an obligation to present our students with inconvenient facts, to make them uncomfortable and to teach them how to assess competing interpretations of our past. Future historians may look back at the Texas textbook wars as a prime example of how contemporary political movements shape how we engage history. I can't think of a better example of that than the current campaign waged by conservatives to remove ""bias"" from textbooks. Their success threatens to impoverish our students, teachers, and classrooms. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Daniel Czitrom.","Daniel Czitrom co-wrote an American history textbook banned in Texas eight years ago .

"(CNN) -- When a Phoenix teacher, way back in 2004, offered four students the option of learning marine science through textbook lessons or by building an underwater robot, the students chose the hands-on approach. It was a decision that revealed the power of experiential learning and created the opening scene for a Hollywood script. ""I had nothing to do. I felt like a loser,"" one of the students, Lorenzo Santillan, told an Arizona newspaper in 2008. Without the robot club, ""I would have probably just dropped out of high school."" In fact, all four students graduated from high school. ""All these kids have taken what they've learned and decided that they can be leaders in their community,"" the robotics teacher, Fredi Lajvardi, says in a new documentary film, Underwater Dreams. The film tracks four Hispanic students who started the robotics team at Carl Hayden High School in Phoenix, a decade ago. Working under gifted teachers, the guys build an underwater robot, nicknamed Stinky. The fun starts when they enter a national competition that pits their machine against robots from both high school and college teams. No need to spoil the finish. It's enough to say that the tale, with a tampon prominent in the construction of the robot, inspired a long-form piece in WIRED magazine, a new Hollywood feature starring George Lopez and Marisa Tomei, and the documentary film. As part of a deal with NBCUniversal and AMC Theatres, ""Underwater Dreams"" opens Friday, July 11, in Los Angles and New York, before rolling out to other cities. Underwriters include the Bezos Family Foundation, The Laurie M. Tisch Illumination Fund and the Virginia Piper Charitable Trust. While ""Underwater Dreams"" is a compelling tale about four kids who beat the odds, it carries a larger message about education reform. The need for reform is straightforward. In this century, economic growth depends on jobs for which Americans are not sufficiently trained, at least as compared to other countries. Absent reform, according to the The Jobs Council, U.S. firms will struggle to fill positions that require technical skill. How to implement reform is the sticky part. Reforming education means altering how teachers teach. When I took algebra, chemistry and physics, my teachers stood at the front of the classroom and lectured. If I learned anything, I learned by listening. Today, there is a belief that students learn more by doing. Sounds simple enough, but it's a challenge to reorganize instructional budgets, train new teachers, retrain veteran teachers and bring students and parents along. Instruction ends up looking different than your father's science class, as evidenced by the robotics poetry class offered at one innovative Pennsylvania middle school. ""Underwater Dreams"" adds weight to the argument in favor of hands-on, experiential learning by proving that it can be accomplished in a tough setting, without lots of new resources. The lesson is especially critical for STEM education -- science, technology, engineering and mathematics -- where we must set learning on fire for children who may otherwise disengage from school. I first heard about the Hayden robotics program shortly after the now-famous underwater competition, when the foundation where I work began making grants to support programs at the school. The students saw they could accomplish more than they ever could have imagined. Whether they went on to become an Army paratrooper like Oscar Vazquez or a chef, as Santillan has done, their high school experience helped. ""With robotics, the kids fell in love with building, pure and simple,"" ""Underwater Dreams"" filmmaker Mary Mazzio told me in an e-mail. ""They loved the kinesthetic learning of how things worked. Although they didn't call it engineering, that is what they fell in love with. Oscar first learned to make a catapult for Halloween -- and they concocted a giant catapult right out of Joan of Arc -- and had pumpkins smashing everywhere. He fell in love."" From the film, I was struck by Dean Kamen's remarks on the need to develop talented young people. An inventor whose creations include the Segway, Kamen is also founder of FIRST robotics, which enables more than 350,000 students to build robots annually. I called Kamen to ask him whether the kids in ""Underwater Dreams"" represent a fluke, or whether all students could flourish this way. ""You didn't find two needles in the haystack,"" Kamen said. ""You found a stack of needles. They are all sharp. All they needed was a little guidance, a little support."" Let's hope the release of ""Underwater Dreams"" leads to more schools uncovering more of these needles.

"(CNN) -- And then there were two. Sunday's showpiece European Championship final in the Ukrainian capital Kiev pits holders Spain against Italy, between them the winners of the last two World Cups. Spain are on the brink of creating soccer history; never before has a country won three major international football tournaments in a row and the Spanish, who won Euro 2008 and the 2010 World Cup, now have the chance to earn a place in the record books. Before the Euros, former Barcelona and England striker Gary Lineker said ""La Furia Roja"" were just one trophy away from greatness. ""If they won three tournaments in a row, something no other team has done, you would have to put them up there among the all-time greatest teams,"" said Lineker, who helped England reach the World Cup semifinals in 1990. Spain reach Euro 2012 final after shootout victory . Vicente del Bosque's side enjoyed huge good fortune in Wednesday's semifinal against Iberian neighbors Portugal, winning 4-2 in a penalty shootout after a 0-0 draw, with Cesc Fabregas scuffing the decisive spot-kick as it hit the inside of the post and rolled along the goalline before creeping into Rui Patricio's net. Fabregas' penalty can perhaps be seen as a symbol of Spain's unconvincing performances at Euro 2012 so far, which have left a large proportion of the watching public unsatisfied as they struggled to break down packed opposition defenses. The end of a love affair? For all their possession (Spain have enjoyed around 67% of the ball in their five matches), there has been frustration that they have neither moved the ball around quickly enough nor created enough goalscoring chances, instead wearing the other team down by making their players chase shadows before waiting for a mistake. Whisper it quietly, but some have even labeled Spain's previously much-feted tiki-taka style of play ""boring"" and claimed it is currently a more defensive tactic than offensive -- an argument perhaps backed up by the fact that Spain have now not conceded a knockout-stage goal in any tournament since the 2006 World Cup, a run of nine matches and a remarkable 900 minutes of action. Against Italy in the group stage and France in the last eight, Del Bosque even picked a starting XI without a single striker -- a tactic designed to help Spain keep the ball better and lure the opposing defense out so they could get in behind. It hasn't worked flawlessly, but they have churned out results regardless. Beautiful football might be what people demand, but results are what Del Bosque deals in first; since taking over from previous coach Luis Aragones following Euro 2008, the 61-year-old has led the national team to an incredible 50 wins from 59 matches. Midfielder Andres Iniesta, who scored the winner in the 2010 World Cup final, says Spain aren't bothered by the ""boring"" tag. The 27-year-old instead focuses on the positives of their possession-based game. ""When a team wants to attack and comes up against an opponent that sits back and tries to close the space and not try to create its own chances, that's not always the football you want to watch,"" said Iniesta. ""It's easy to forget that only a few years ago this style is what changed the story of Spain."" A change in mentality . It is a story that began at Euro 2008 -- and really, truly began with Spain's quarterfinal penalty shootout victory over Italy in Vienna, a match that defender Gerard Pique looks back on as the turning point. ""I think it changed the mentality of the national team,"" said the Barcelona star. ""Before, Spain played to avoid losing -- but afterwards they played to win."" Italy were the World Cup champions at the time and favorites to go through, but it is perhaps not as well remembered that they were missing the suspended Andrea Pirlo, who has been in such glorious form at this tournament. Pirlo, let's not forget, was also injured at the 2010 World Cup and played only 34 minutes in their final group game game as Italy crashed out at the first hurdle following draws with Paraguay and New Zealand and a 3-2 defeat at the hands of Slovakia. But the 33-year-old midfielder is enjoying a stunning renaissance in his career. A year ago he was discarded by AC Milan after 10 years of service, but signed for Juventus and led ""The Old Lady"" to the Italian league title before showcasing the full range of his majestic talents for the world to see in Poland and Ukraine. If Italy were besieged by the storm of another match-fixing scandal in their domestic game brewing prior to Euro 2012, Pirlo provided the steady hand on the tiller to sail the ship into calmer waters. With hardly a hair out of place and rarely breaking into a sweat, the masterful Pirlo has dictated the knockout matches against England and Germany with breathtaking class, providing an exhibition in how to create space and pass the ball both of the long and short variety. The master and the maverick . When looking long, Pirlo has often sought out Mario Balotelli, the maverick Manchester City striker who is as well-known for his controversial lifestyle away from football as his performances on the pitch -- something which may change after his monumental two-goal showing against the much-fancied Germans in the semifinal. Balotelli double sends Italy through to Euro 2012 final . Balotelli went into Euro 2012 considered a talented liability, as capable of moments of madness as those of brilliance, but he powered home a header to give Italy the lead and then crashed a stunning second into the top corner from 18 yards. Even Germany keeper Manuel Neuer had to applaud the 21-year-old's chutzpah. ""Tonight was the most beautiful of my life -- but I hope that this Sunday is even better,"" said Balotelli in the aftermath. ""Along with Spain, we are the two best teams in the tournament. We are the only side to have scored against Spain so far. We proved that we are equal to them, if not more, and we want to win."" Whoever wins on Sunday, it will provide a fairytale finish to a competition that has surpassed all expectations. Scare stories . The buildup to the first major football tournament behind the old Iron Curtain in eastern Europe was dominated by scare stories: the transport infrastructure wasn't ready; there weren't enough (affordable) hotels for supporters to stay in; racism was a widespread problem in both host countries; foreign fans would not be welcomed in many of the host cities, and so on. Yet most of the fears have been unfounded. Yes, there have been issues with supporters that European football's governing body UEFA has had to deal with, and member associations have been fined for specific incidents of failing to keep their fans under control. Some of the magnificent stadia have not been full for every game, but that is probably down to the fact that Europe is going through difficult economic times right now and Poland and Ukraine are further away than most host nations have been, resulting in increased traveling costs. But by and large, Euro 2012 has been an unqualified success. The group stage matches were full of attacking intent and fine goals and the knockout stages have produced two penalty shootouts of unbearable tension, not to mention Italy's awesome destruction of Germany. Referees have let games flow and kept the card count down, and the players have responded by concentrating more on their football and less on feigning injury and trying to artificially gain their team an advantage. Everywhere you looked, there was a story: Andriy Shevchenko gave the Ukraine people a memory they will never forget with two goals to see off Sweden; Greece put their country's vast financial problems aside to qualify from Group A; the much-fancied Netherlands went back home with tails between legs; and then there was Spain and Italy, quietly working their way through the tournament. Sensational scoring . With 30 of the 31 matches played we have seen only three red cards -- two of which came in the opening game as Poland drew with Greece -- and there have been 21 goals scored from headers, which at 29% of the total 72 stands way higher than at any previous Euros. Wonderful goals have crashed in with regularity, from the acrobatics of Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Balotelli to the gorgeous flick of Danny Welbeck, the emphatic volleys of Sami Khedira and Marco Reus to the unstoppable rocket shots of Jakub Blaszczykowski and, again, Balotelli. And then there was Pirlo's ""Panenka."" With England leading Italy 2-1 after the first two penalties in Sunday's quarterfinal shootout, Pirlo produced a moment of genius to change the momentum entirely in Italy's favor. He watched the England keeper buzz around on the line trying to put him off, before coolly chipping the ball -- a la Antonin Panenka in the 1976 European Championship final shootout -- delicately into the net after Joe Hart had dived early and erroneously to his right. England missed their next two penalties and Italy triumphed. ""Hart seemed to be very confident in himself. I needed to do something to beat him and it seemed to be a psychological blow,"" said the unflappable Pirlo. England boss Roy Hodgson added: ""The cool, calculated way Pirlo chipped it, that is something you either have or you don't have as a player."" The watching football world swooned, and Pirlo produced his second successive man-of-the-match display to help Italy slay Germany in the semis and continue the Azzurri's amazing record of never having lost a competitive game to ""Die Mannschaft."" On Sunday, Cesare Prandelli's team can keep another record intact: that of a country never winning three major international tournaments in a row. Spain are potentially 90 minutes away from sporting immortality. A captivating conclusion to Euro 2012 lies in wait.","Holders Spain to meet Italy in Sunday's Euro 2012 final in Kiev .

"(CNN) -- The new anti-smoking campaign launched by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is a smart move. This is the largest nationwide advertising effort the CDC has ever launched to combat tobacco addiction. By spending $54 million and playing stark and graphic advertisements throughout the country, the government hopes to drive home the message that smoking is harmful and that there is help for those who want to quit. Smoking and second-hand exposure to it is the leading cause of preventable death and chronic disease in the United States. Smoking-related illnesses, like cancer, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, account for a very large proportion of costs on our health care system and economy. Anti-smoking symbol reveals 'worst moment' Various communities, state and federal agencies have tried to educate the public about the adverse health effect of smoking by implementing smoke-free environmental policies, raising taxes on tobacco products, pushing out mass media campaigns and adding school programs. However, the tobacco industry easily outspends them and the combined campaign efforts of the American Cancer Society, the American Lung Association and the American Heart Association. With its ability to avoid regulatory restraints on its marketing strategies, the tobacco industry has considerable clout. And it would do everything it takes to beat back government policies that threaten its continued recruitment or retention of smokers. In 2009, Congress passed a law that would allow the Food and Drug Administration to add warnings about smoking on cigarette packages, including a 1-800-QUIT-NOW hot line for smokers who want help with quitting. When the Food and Drug Administration required that tobacco companies put stronger graphic warning labels on cigarette packages, the industry sued, citing infringement of the First Amendment. The court ruled in February that the government cannot require tobacco companies to use stronger labels. Given the legal setback, the question is whether the government can still somehow fulfill the legislative mandate, which was already compromised by lobbying that forced, for example, the omission of menthol from the banned additive substances in tobacco. (As a result, the tobacco industry can continue exploiting new smokers, especially minority groups, with soothing menthol cigarettes that would otherwise be less appealing to smoke.) With the congressional mandate in limbo, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's initiative comes at just the right time. By launching this campaign on television, in print and on the Internet, it is making up for what the FDA cannot do at this point. As states and communities are hard hit by declining budgets, fighting Big Tobacco demands not only commitment, but also creativity and ingenuity. Perhaps one day, our courts will allow the government to add graphic warning messages about smoking on tobacco products. Other countries, such as Canada and Australia, have instituted those kinds of labels and have seen an effective reduction in smoking. America should take heed. Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion .

"Washington (CNN) -- Labor unions must give nonmember workers ""fresh notice"" of unplanned increases in fees or assessments -- money that might be used for political purposes -- the Supreme Court ruled Thursday. The justices said those nonunion workers must be allowed to make an informed choice about how those kinds of fees are spent, allowing them to object and obtain a rebate. The 7-2 decision is a victory for Dianne Knox, a California state employee, who sought to opt out of a $12 million assessment imposed by the Service Employees International Union Local 1000. She did not belong to SEIU, unlike most of her fellow government workers. State law allows unions to charge nonmembers annual dues -- called ""fair share fees"" -- to help support the collective bargaining efforts on behalf of all government workers, including the majority of workers who belong to the SEIU. At issue was whether nonunion employees may be constitutionally required to pay special fees to a union to help cover things like political spending on ballot measures. After two ballot measures were added in a special state election in 2006 , the union decided to impose a 25% supplemental, separate, and temporary increase in fees to ""build a political fight-back fund."" The money, said officials, would be used ""for a broad range of political expenses, including television and radio advertising, direct mail, voter registration, voter education, and get-out-the-vote activities in our work sites and in our communities across California."" The high court noted nonunion members were not given a choice on whether they would ""opt in"" and pay into this special fund, and the money was taken directly out of their paychecks and pensions. About 28,000 current and former workers who were not members of SEIU sued, and the high court supported them. ""This aggressive use of power by the SEIU is indefensible,"" wrote Justice Samuel Alito. ""We see no justification for the union's failure to provide a fresh ... notice"" of the special fee, whether it involves political activities or not.. ""When a public-sector union imposes a special assessment of dues increase, the union must provide a fresh ... notice and may not exact any funds from nonunion members without their affirmative consent,"" Alito added. The high court in past cases has ruled nonunion public sector workers cannot be forced to pay for union activities not directly related to collective bargaining. That would include many kinds of political lobbying and advertising. Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg agreed with their more conservative colleagues that fair notice must be given for nonmembers to opt out of pure political lobbying by unions. But they said the majority went too far by ruling that the requirement applies to other kinds opt-out fee collections as well, which they said was never argued or briefed by the opposing parties. In complete dissent were Justices Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan. ""If the union's basic administrative system does not violate the Constitution, then how could its special assessment have done so,"" asked Breyer, who delivered his dissent from the bench, a rarely exercised privilege. ""I do not believe the First Amendment requires a second objection opportunity to those nonmembers who did not object the first time."" The case is Knox v. Service Employees International Union (10-1121).","Labor unions must tell nonmember workers about new fees for political purposes .
The court's 7-2 ruling is a victory for a California state employee .

"(CNN) -- ""There is a nasty bug going around,"" wrote Kelly Ishmael on her blog back in January. ""A lot of my friends have been bitten by it and it is highly contagious."" Indeed, it is contagious -- particularly among women. Some might call it addictive, even. Nevertheless, no, this article doesn't belong in the health section. Because the bug that's infected Ishmael, her friends and thousands of women around the world is called Pinterest. And there's no known cure. Pinterest, for the uninitiated, is a highly visual website that lets users collect -- or ""pin"" -- items from around the Web. The main thing that separates it from older social bookmarking sites, such as del.icio.us, is its emphasis on images. And it's that visual interest that makes Pinterest -- created by three men, by the way -- so popular among women, whether they're planning a wedding or looking for a craft to try with their girlfriends. Pinterest grew 400% from September to December last year, and the site's users are about 58% women. Why the appeal? Pinterest user and social media consultant Colleen Pence thinks she knows the answer: . ""Everything on Pinterest looks so appealing, so gorgeous, so effortless,"" she wrote on CNN iReport. ""And somehow merely viewing these amazing things makes us feel that we can elevate ourselves and -- heck -- our lives to that level of sophistication, creativity and beauty if only we could make/wear/cook/say/invent those things too."" Pinboards, then, serve as inspiration for those who create them. But do those beautiful boards result in any real-life change or creativity? Pence is skeptical, and even Pinterest addict Ishmael admits that she usually spends more time pinning than doing. ""The problem with Pinterest, though, is that I spend a lot of time pinning, pinning, pinning and not enough time trying, trying, trying,"" she wrote on her blog. So she decided to challenge herself with a venture she's calling 52 Weeks of Pinspiration, during which she'll try out a different Pinterest-inspired project each week and blog about her experience and results.","Pinterest is a rapidly growing, highly visual online ""pinboard""

"(CNN) -- One person has come to the United States and come down with Ebola here. Authorities want to keep it that way. To that end, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Wednesday beefed-up measures at five of America's biggest, busiest airports aimed at preventing the deadly virus' further spread. While talk about preventing Ebola's spread abounds everywhere from coffee shops to TV news, this intervention won't affect a lot of people. It applies only to about 150 people a day, by CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden's estimate, arriving in the United States after having recently traveled from Ebolva-ravaged West African nations of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. These travelers will get special treatment, including having their temperature taken and answering questions about whether they've been exposed to anyone with Ebola. The idea is to stop anyone with warning signs from getting past the airport gates, and into the U.S. public, before they can possibly spread the virus any further. But, Frieden cautioned, this isn't some sort of magic solution. U.S. officials will likely discover some people have fevers or have had contacts with Ebola sufferers, only to find out they don't have the virus. Someone can still unknowingly come to the United States and show no signs of it, since it can take up to 21 days for someone to feel sick. Plus, there are more ways than ever for people to cross communities, cross borders, cross oceans and spread a virus like Ebola. ""We are stepping up protection for people, (and) we will continuously look at ways that we can increase the safety of Americans,"" Frieden told reporters. ""(But) whatever we do can't get the risk to zero here in the interconnected world that we live in today."" Can you catch Ebola on a plane? New policy in place of 5 of America's busiest airports . Some of the measures to halt Ebola's spread are already happening -- in West Africa. The U.S. government has been involved in efforts at international airports in the hardest-hit nations to question travelers about their health and exposure to Ebola, as well as take their temperature using what Frieden describes as FDA-approved devices. During those screenings, 74 people with fevers and three more with other symptoms were stopped from boarding planes, according to Frieden. None of those are thought to have Ebola, something the CDC director attributed to the fact that high temperatures also are a symptom of malaria, a common ailment in Africa spread by mosquitoes, but not person-to-person. The U.S. process for now will be in effect in only five airports -- where 94% of all travelers from West Africa enter the United States. It will start Saturday at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, which has nearly half of all such passengers. The same thing will roll out next week at Dulles International Airport outside the nation's capital, Newark Liberty International Airport in northern New Jersey, O'Hare International Airport in Chicago and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. Here's how it will work. It starts with U.S. authorities identifying anyone who'd recently been in West Africa, whether they flew in directly or via a connecting flight. Alejandro Mayorkas, deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, explained that ""we have in our screening capabilities the ability to identify individuals traveling not only with respect to the last point of departure but the point of origin."" ""So ... we can, in fact, identify the full journey of the individual arriving in the United States,"" said Mayorkas. Customs and Border Protection -- the federal agency charged with safeguarding U.S. borders and airports -- will take the lead, escorting pinpointed travelers to a what Mayorkas called a ""quarantine station."" There, they will be asked questions about their health and possible exposure to Ebola, something that might tip off authorities that they might pose a risk. These CBP officers, who won't be wearing any masks, will also place a non-contact thermometer over travelers' foreheads to take their temperature, since having a fever is one symptom of Ebola. If there are any red flags, the person will be evaluated by a CDC public health officer on site. He or she will then be given the OK to go, taken to a hospital or be referred to a local health department for monitoring and support. Complete coverage on Ebola . All passengers who fly from West Africa will be given information about how to monitor themselves for possible symptoms, will be asked to log their temperature daily and be asked to provide their contact information to authorities. Debate if more travel restrictions necessary . The only person to be diagnosed with Ebola in the United States, Thomas Eric Duncan, died Wednesday in a Dallas hospital. Duncan traveled from Liberia, via Belgium, before arriving in Texas on September 20. It's not likely the stepped-up screening would have affected him, according to Frieden, because he didn't appear to show signs of the virus until a few days after his arrival. Ebola patient dies in Texas . There are many more like him, people who have spent time in West Africa and been exposed, whether they know it or not, to the disease. Frieden called the outbreak ""unprecedented,"" given how quickly its spread through the regions. According to the World Health Organization, more than 800 people have been infected with Ebola and at least 3,800 have died. Authorities have said the actual numbers are probably much higher, because many people may have died before authorities firmly identified Ebola as a cause, and others -- like Duncan -- may have the disease without knowing it or reporting it to officials. And things aren't getting any better. According to a WHO update released Wednesday, ""the situation in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone continues to deteriorate, with widespread and persistent transmission of (Ebola)."" This alarming trend -- and the fact that there's been at least one person to bring Ebola unknowingly into the United States -- has spurred some calls to stop on all travel into the United States from West Africa so long as the virus is spreading. Sen. Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat, has publicly urged Secretary of State John Kerry to suspend U.S. travel visas of those from the affected region for any ""unnecessary travel"" and not to issue new visas. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, a prominent civil rights leader who has served as a spokesman for Duncan's family, argued that such measures will hurt the economies of longtime American allies such as Liberia. ""We should quarantine the disease, not quarantine nations and not quarantine airline flights,"" the civil rights leader said. ""We should not panic."" Frieden, the CDC director, also spoke against such a ban, arguing that severe travel restrictions will create more problems than they solve. ""It makes it hard to get health workers in, because they can't get out,"" he said. ""If we make it harder to respond to the outbreak in West Africa, it will spread not only in those three countries (in West Africa hit hardest by Ebola) but to other parts of Africa and ultimately increase the risk here"" in the United States.""","New airport screening measures will affect travelers from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone .

"(CNN) -- The phone calls keep coming in as family and friends plead with Laura Libman, asking her not to go to Mexico. Community health workers, or promotoras, in El Reparo, Mexico, take patients' blood pressure. But the founder and CEO of the Arizona-based Tia Foundation, a nonprofit that strives to bring health care solutions and strategies to rural Mexico, can think of no more important time -- what with the swine flu scare -- to take the journey. ""Our job is to go down when people are sick and not stay here and be afraid,"" she said from the Phoenix area. ""It's our mission, and I have to do it."" The World Health Organization says cases of swine flu have been confirmed worldwide, in countries that include the United States, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and Israel. But Mexico has appeared to be the epicenter of the swine flu outbreak, with health officials saying the virus may have caused more than 150 deaths and roughly 2,500 illnesses there. And that fact is increasingly scaring off prospective travelers to the country. The Tia Foundation -- ""tia"" means aunt in Spanish -- targets the poorest of villages, places that generally lack basic health care facilities, not to mention vehicles to get to hospitals hours away, and where the people, often unschooled and malnourished, are more susceptible to disease, Libman said.  Watch answers to swine flu questions » . Through a partnership with the community medicine program at La Universidad Autónoma de Guadalajara, the 3½ -year-old foundation trains local health care workers who are chosen by villagers and arms them with medical kits and medicines so they can take care of their own. ""It's a great help ... a 50/50 partnership,"" said Francisco Casteñeda Rico, the doctor in charge of the community medicine program, which has been reaching out to rural communities for more than 30 years.""We can do it without Tia, but with the help [the funding, promotion and supplies], it comes out better."" Of the 98 health workers who have been selected and trained, all of them are women, Libman said. This is because they're seen as caregivers and also because many men leave to find work, she explained. But Libman, 45, added that ""an unintended but extremely positive outcome"" has been the ""creation of female leadership"" and empowerment. Kathy McCraine, a freelance journalist and photographer, saw evidence of this when she traveled in 2007 and 2008 to Mexico to write a story for Thunderbird Magazine, a publication for alumni of the Thunderbird School of Global Management, which Libman attended in Glendale, Arizona. She spoke of the confidence women exuded while taking charge and helping others. McCraine fell in love with the foundation and ended up donating a $500 medical kit to one of the health care workers, or promotoras, after she graduated from the intensive week of training. The recipient, McCraine remembered, ""just felt that people respected her more. She was able to do something for her community, and that made her really proud."" Collectively, the promotoras, who are not paid, are helping serve 30,000 to 50,000 people, Libman said. They're doing everything from delivering babies and suturing wounds to treating infections, checking blood-sugar levels and teaching the importance of simple hand-washing. The next village project is set to launch May 18 in the state of Jalisco. Libman said she'll probably head down May 8, as she also is on a mission to hire a medical director for the foundation. She usually travels with foundation interns but, because of the swine flu scare, cannot bring them this time around ""for liability reasons,"" she said. Nicole Ostrofe, a 23-year-old Thunderbird student and a summer intern who just started this week, found out only Tuesday that she wouldn't be going. She was crushed, as she was really hoping to do field work and give back to the region where she studied abroad during her undergraduate years. ""It's been a total up and down,"" she said. ""Congratulations, you got the internship! By the way, you can't go to Mexico."" In her place, a former intern, Wynona Heim, may go along as a volunteer -- someone free to sign a liability release -- to help with all that needs to be done. Is she at all concerned about the swine flu? ""I have two young children, but right now Jalisco has no outbreaks,"" said Heim, 31, who's keeping a close watch on developments. ""Plus, I'd be surrounded by doctors. Can you get any safer?"" For her part, Libman's worry is that her flight may be canceled. If it is, she said she's prepared to hop in her car and drive if she has to. ""The only way we're going to cancel the project is if the university brigade,"" the team of medical students who train villagers, gets ""called out to treat people in an emergency,"" she said. ""It's going to be a day-to-day, hour-to-hour decision over here as to whether we'll be able to do our work."" She is hopeful, though, that the next wave of training will kick off as planned -- especially now, as concerns about swine flu sweep through Mexico and the remote villages remain the most underserved. ""I hope the State Department doesn't take any other steps that'll hinder organizations like ours,"" she said. And to those who remain concerned about her plans and her personal safety, she said this: ""I could just as easily be hit by a bus here. ... Do you tell Doctors without Borders they shouldn't go to a place that has armed conflict?""

"(Mental Floss) -- Are you thinking of getting a graduate degree, but want something with a narrower focus than an MBA or a JD? Schools around the world offer all sorts of incredibly focused graduate degrees to students who are trying to break into very specific fields. Here's a look at a handful of programs you might not have known about. 1. The Beatles, Liverpool Hope University . Anyone can listen to the Beatles' records, but it takes a special kind of fan to pursue a master's degree in the Fab Four. Last March, Liverpool Hope University announced that during the 2009-10 academic year it would begin offering a first-of-its-kind masters degree in a field of study it dubbed ""The Beatles, Popular Music, and Society."" The program consists of two night classes per week for an academic year and focuses on everything from the band's songs to the influence of their fashion on youth culture. Really, the only way to top this degree would be to get a doctorate in Rolling Stones-ology. 2. Thanatology, Hood College . At first it may seem a bit odd that a person would want to get a Master of Arts in Thanatology, or the academic study of death, but Hood College offers the course of study to prepare students for work with terminally ill patients and the bereaved. Graduates of the program leave with a greater understanding of death and the grief process, which gives them a specific set of skills they can take to work in hospices, hospitals, or nursing homes. 3. Puppetry, University of Connecticut . If you're an aspiring puppeteer in search of a master's degree, you've got one choice: the University of Connecticut. UConn has been offering classes in puppetry since 1964, and the school now says it's the only institution in the country that offers MA and MFA options for puppet arts. Courses like ""DA 5601: Marionette Construction"" would be sure to make you the envy of any friends slogging through more mundane coursework in their own grad programs. Mental Floss: 9 muppets kicked off Sesame Street . 4. Homeland Security, Fairleigh Dickinson University . Want to spruce up your resume for a job in homeland security? If you've got an Internet connection, you can earn a Master of Science in Homeland Security (MSHS) from Fairleigh Dickinson University. The degree requires 12 courses, including core classes like ""Weapons of Mass Destruction/Terrorism Awareness."" 5. Recreation Administration, California State University Long Beach . California State University Long Beach offers a Master of Science in Recreation Administration through its Department of Recreation & Leisure Studies. According to the program's Web site, it ""helps prepare professional personnel who can contribute to the development of a philosophy of leisure"" and ""are competent managers of private and public agencies and programs."" 6. Fire Protection Engineering, Worcester Polytechnic Institute . Yes, this one's a niche, but it's one we're all glad exists. Worcester Polytechnic Institute offers grad degrees in fire protection engineering that include coursework like ""FPE 575: Explosion Protection"" and ""FPE 554: Advanced Fire Suppression."" 7. Parapsychology, Coventry University . If you're interested in scientifically studying the existence of psychic abilities and life after death, England's Coventry University has just the program for you. According to the school, its distance-learning MSc in Parapsychology ""provides a thorough empirical, theoretical and methodological introduction to the controversial field of parapsychology."" Whether or not you believe in ESP, you've got to admit a course title like ""Extrasensory Perception and Psychokinesis Research"" sounds a lot more interesting than many graduate classes. Mental Floss: 11 unusual college majors . 8. Anime, Tokyo University of the Arts . Tokyo University of the Arts offers a course of graduate study in anime that evaluates existing work while also challenging its students to create innovative new animations of their own. 9. Lighting Design, Parsons the New School for Design . Parsons the New School for Design claims that it offers the only architectural lighting program focused ""primarily on design and social practice."" Students learn about ""the intellectual, aesthetic, and technical aspects of lighting"" in order to design better-lit spaces. 10. Gastronomy, Boston University . Boston University offers a multidisciplinary Master of Liberal Arts in Gastronomy that offers students a chance to study ""the role of food in historical and contemporary societies from a variety of perspectives."" The program draws from arts, humanities, and social science departments to help students flesh out their understanding of foods. If you love food, this sentence from the program's Web site has to make your mouth water a bit: ""The program offers special emphasis on experiential learning through hands-on culinary arts laboratories and wine studies courses."" Mental Floss: 10 foods that (thankfully) flopped . 11. Wood & Paper Science, North Carolina State . North Carolina State University's College of Natural Resources offers a variety of masters and doctoral programs through its Department of Wood & Paper Science. According to the program's Web site, students' coursework can included classes on such specific topics as wood-moisture relations and lumber drying, paper physics, and wood tool design, performance, and wear. 12. Sequential Art, Savannah College of Art and Design . Savannah College of Art and Design offers students the chance to get their MFA in sequential art. What exactly is sequential art, though? It includes comic books, graphic novels, storyboards, and children's books. The program gives students the chance to take some pretty specific coursework, including electives on Manga and superhero comics, comic strips, and advanced writing for comics. 13. Appalachian Studies, Appalachian State . Appalachian State University offers masters degrees through its Centers for Appalachian Studies. Students in the interdisciplinary program can concentrate on Appalachian culture, sustainable development, or Appalachian music. The program also offers students a chance to study abroad in Wales for a comparative analysis of Wales and Appalachia, including a look at Welsh migration patterns to Appalachia.

"(CNN) -- I'm no stranger to the kind of dehumanized violence we saw happen in a Colorado movie theater earlier this summer. As a hostage negotiator, I've been held hostage myself four times in the line of duty. That's never a comfortable place to be, but I kept in mind that the success rate of hostage negotiators is as high as 95% and I knew why. Hostage negotiators are successful because they build trust through dialogue. That dialogue changes the mindset of the hostage taker so he will surrender his weapons and hostages, even though he is aware he will probably go to prison. In essence, the hostage negotiator becomes a ""secure base"" to the hostage taker. A secure base provides a sense of safety and stretch, just as a parent, grandparent, or caretaker provides their child both protection and encouragement to go out and explore and take risks. Today, I work mostly with corporate leaders instead of hostage takers. In my book ""Care to Dare"" I define a secure base as ""someone or something that gives protection or sense of protection, inspires or brings forth energy within an individual."" With this inspiration and energy, individuals step out of their comfort zones and strive to fulfill their untapped potential. I believe this quality is the single most important criterion for delivering sustainable high-performance leadership. See also: Want be a leader? Act like one . Many hostage takers have few secure bases in their lives. Hostage taking is always preceded by a loss or a series of losses. The most dangerous hostage taker is the person who has no attachments and refuses to talk. However, when a hostage negotiator offers hopes, options, and positive solutions by gaining the trust of the hostage taker, he or she can become a secure base. To become a secure base to my hostage takers meant caring about them as people and gaining their trust to explore positive solutions both for them and their hostages. Once I understood the motivation behind the hostage taking, I could begin the search for options. By tactfully leading the way and while acting as a ""secure base,"" I was able to disarm my four hostage takers without force. Each time, I survived precisely because I cared for the person who had a weapon trained on me. That process involved creating a relationship -- an emotional bond -- with the hostage taker. Neuroscience explains why this bonding works. The human brain has one goal: to survive. That's why humans are always searching for the negative and instinctively act defensively. However, when a secure base creates a bond, the resulting sense of protection lets the brain shut down its defensive focus. Then the brain can look for positives and opportunities. James Holmes, the accused shooter in the Aurora mass murder, is a typical example of a ""loner"" who has no secure bases or recently lost them: his university position as student, his identity, his apartment, his girlfriend, his father, to name just a few. As someone with extensive experience with severely troubled people, I see his lack of secure bases as a key contributing factor to his alleged crimes. These days, I am a professor of leadership and organizational behavior, yet I still focus on the most basic human needs that drive behavior. If leaders are not secure bases to their employees, employees cannot trust them and they will be defensive and even feel like hostages. Gallup studies show extremely low rates of employee engagement: 7% in France, 12% in Germany, 17 % in the UK, and 28% in the United States. The major finding was that high engagement was connected to high emotional care from the immediate boss -- a boss who became a secure base. When caring was present, the employees would ""dare"" to take risks and stretch themselves to achieve great things. This winning combination of caring and daring not only shuts down defenses, it can also unleash extraordinary potential. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of George Kohlrieser.","As a former hostage negotiator, George Kohlrieser has been held hostage four times .

"(CNN) -- What I learned is what we all forget: It's more than a game. It's easy to lose that understanding with a sport as popular, profitable and money-grubbing as football. This Saturday, TV screens will be filled with college conference title games -- even as universities race each other to new conferences in search of a higher bidder. On Sundays, the NFL's cool efficiency can look more bloodless than its own video games, as if the real thing was now just a parlor game to bet on. But high school football remains the sport's origin story. Despite its own set of perversions, especially during recruiting season, it's still mostly a hyper-local, myth-making phenomenon that defines small towns, suburban communities and urban pockets across the country. Photos: 75 amazing sports moments you missed this year . Two seasons ago, I spent a year in Valdosta, a quaint outpost of about 54,000 in deepest South Georgia, to write a book about that phenomenon. I embedded for a season with players, coaches, boosters and families to chronicle the rise, fall and hoped-for resurrection of the winningest high school football program in America. Under two era-spanning coaches, Valdosta High won 23 state championships and six national titles. It won so often, for so long, that it could lose every game for the next 65 seasons and still have a record above .500. But Valdosta hadn't won the state title since 1998, the longest drought in its 100-year history, and was on its fourth coach in nine years. Like much of the rest of the country, it seemed, Valdosta was at a crossroad. This was a place that once held the funeral for one of its most revered coaches inside the football stadium, where nearly 8,000 mourners gazed out at an open casket set on the 50-yard line. The current coach holds his weekly radio show inside a barbecue palace called The Smokin' Pig, run by one of the 21 former Wildcats descended from the same O'Neal. Season tickets are passed down in wills, if they're passed down at all. During a wake a couple years ago for one longtime fan, six tickets for the next home game were spotted in the open casket. But stuff like that can be written off as garden variety, Southern Gothic eccentricity. The players wanted to talk to me about why they went out there on Friday nights and what football meant to them. That's when the game's mysterious inner world really opened up. This wasn't the sport of luxury suites, beer commercials and wardrobe malfunctions at halftime. This was football as muse, lifeline, God's will and cultural imperative. This was the chance for some kids who'd already run out of chances to let out one loud, lasting yelp into the wilderness -- a way to show everybody in town who they were, what they were capable of, why they mattered. ""A poet uses a pencil to express himself,"" senior running back Phillip Moore tapped onto his Facebook page from his phone before one game, ""but ima football player so i use 9.5 pair of nikes on turf."" For Reggie McQueen, a defensive back and aspiring rapper, taking the field on Friday nights allowed him to watch his parents smile, talk with a dead aunt, and play a little ball beside his murdered cousin. As he and his swaggering teammates entered 11,000-seat Bazemore-Hyder Stadium (named for the school's two late, iconic coaches), the stage-lit carpet inside morphed into a fantastical world unlike anything he lived in the rest of the week. The first person he usually spotted in the stands was his mother, who had Reggie when she was 14, standing and clapping and smiling. Then somewhere nearby he'd find his father, divorced and remarried, and who Reggie mostly remembers as being in jail. Now a landscaper and a preacher, he stood and cheered for his son, too. Then came the game. Crouching in the defensive backfield before each play -- dreads spilling from his helmet, tats stamped up and down both arms -- Reggie often talked aloud to his dead cousin, gunned down a year earlier in a shootout at a public housing complex across town from the one where Reggie and his mother then lived. ""What would you do, Junior?"" he'd say, as if his cousin was a teammate crouched beside him. Or: ""This is a big one, Junior. Let's fly!""Or he'd talk to a long-dead aunt who lived with Reggie and his mother, the light of young Reggie's life before she was murdered. The crime went unsolved until after the funeral, when police returned to her grave, dug up her coffin and found the gun used to kill her hidden beneath her corpse. Their deaths still weighed heavily on Reggie, and the football field felt like a secure, supportive place to work some of that out. Life was hard. Football was easy. ""I got a lot of people who aren't here on my back,"" Reggie told me one night. ""On Friday night, they're living through me. ""On the field, it's my own world,"" he went on. ""It's a place where I can be myself. I don't have to worry about anyone fussin'. My parents come to games and I see them smile and clap their hands and stand up -- stuff like that doesn't happen at home. At home, there's always bills to pay. A tragedy. ""That's why I'm not just playing ball,"" Reggie continued. ""It's more than a game. It's what I live for. When people see ballplayers, they think it's just something they do. I'm there because I love to be there. On the field on Friday night, I'm doing something that loves me back -- I love it and it loves me back."" The game also gave Reggie another thing he couldn't find anywhere else: a taste of immortality, no small thing on the disposable streets where he grew up. Reggie gave me a tour one night of the Ora Lee West projects he'd lived in until his mother saved enough money to move them out. He still has relatives there and visits all the time. We left an aunt's apartment around midnight, and as we walked back to my car Reggie spotted a group of guys loitering on a corner a block away. That used to be Reggie. It wasn't anymore. Football made him want something beyond that corner. ""I seen people standing on that same corner all my life,"" Reggie said. ""You can Google me. You can't take anyone on this street and Google them. But you can Google me."" Like Reggie, teammate Malcolm Mitchell also learned to love the game in high school, and it loved him back, too. But while Reggie's last football game as a player was his last game as a Wildcat -- he raps full time now under the stage name Jim Rock -- Malcolm has gone on to star at wide receiver for the University of Georgia. His future looks limitless. Yet he's already tasted immortality, too. Malcolm blossomed into a head-turning athlete his final season at Valdosta -- he wanted to quit his sophomore year until his mother talked him out of it -- and was wooed by schools across the Southeast, including Alabama and Florida. That last high school season, he told me about a voice in his head when he took the field, how it told him to anticipate something before it happened, and what to do when it came about. He said the voice had never been louder or more distinct than it was that year. He'd given up trying to figure out what it was. He was just going with it. ""I want to say it's God telling me that something's going to happen,"" he tried to explain, ""but it's something telling me."" Whatever it was, it worked. Malcolm broke Valdosta's three-decade-old record for most catches in a season. The previous record holder was Stan Rome, widely considered the greatest athlete in Valdosta's history. Stan went on to become an NFL wide receiver, as well as the father of Jay Rome, another highly recruited Wildcat and now Malcolm's teammate and roommate at Georgia. ""I got my way into the museum -- into the history books,"" Malcolm said one afternoon after that season. ""I got to the point where I'll always be remembered. Maybe if I make it to the NFL it'll be bigger than this. Maybe if I make it to the Hall of Fame. But right now, people will remember me for this no matter what."" We talked a little more that afternoon about the Voice; Malcolm detailed the dialogues that ran through his head during a half dozen critical plays that season. I then mentioned Reggie's on-field conversations with relatives from the beyond. Malcolm just smiled. He didn't find any of it weird or unconventional. ""For an athlete who loves to play the game, it happens more than you know,"" he said. ""We're not just running around."" I knew that. Just forgot.","Author documented a season with the winningest high school football program in America .

"(CNN) -- She calls herself ""Diana, the Hunter."" Authorities say the elusive woman has killed at least two bus drivers in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. According to the Chihuahua state attorney's office, the unidentified woman, with either hair dyed blond or wearing a blond wig, shot and killed a city bus driver identified as Jose Roberto Flores Carrera, 45, on August 28. Another bus driver, Fredy Zarate Morales, 32, was killed the next day. In both cases, officials say, ""Diana, the Hunter"" boarded the buses and shot the drivers point blank. After the second shooting, several media outlets in Ciudad Juarez reported receiving an e-mail from a sender claiming to be the killer. In the e-mail, she calls herself ""Diana, the hunter of drivers."" She reportedly says in the e-mails that her motive is retaliation against bus drivers who have raped vulnerable women, especially those who work in the ""maquiladoras,"" or foreign assembly plants (mainly American) on the Mexican side of the border. ""I'm an instrument that will avenge [the attacks against] several women,"" the e-mail is reported to say. ""We seem weak to society, but we're truly not. We're courageous and, if they don't show respect to us, we will make them respect us by our own means. We women of Juarez are strong."" Arturo Sandoval, a spokesman with the Chihuahua state attorney's office, told CNN the end doesn't justify the means. ""Nobody can take justice into their own hands,"" Sandoval said. ""If she was a victim of a bus driver or knows someone in that situation, she has to report it and let authorities do their job."" The Chihuahua state attorney's office released a sketch of the suspect Wednesday and asked for the public's help to catch her. ""The sketch was done after interviewing more than 20 people who witnessed the homicides and who gave us very valuable information for this investigation,"" authorities said in a statement. According to local media reports, citing official sources, authorities know the perpetrator is a woman because she yelled at the second victim before shooting him: ""You guys think you're real bad, don't you?"" The slayings have terrorized many bus drivers, especially those operating Route 4, also known as the Yellow Route, which serves main thoroughfares and downtown Ciudad Juarez, a city of 1.5 million located across the border from El Paso, Texas. Thirty drivers normally cover the route, but many have decided not to show up for work since the second slaying. Julian Vazquez, a bus driver on the same route, is one of those still behind the wheel, although he admits he's afraid. ""There's only about 50% of us working,"" Vazquez told CNN. ""We're full of fear after learning this person killed two of our colleagues and nobody has any clue."" This situation has left hundreds of riders stranded. Others have been forced to look for transportation alternatives for their daily commute. ""Of course we're afraid,"" commuter Maria Banuelos, said. ""We fear that the driver might be attacked or that I will be in harm's way, but we still have to get to our destination."" Ciudad Juarez gained international notoriety in the late 1990s and early 2000s after a wave of slayings involving women. The victims, mainly young, single women, would disappear, their bodies later found in shallow graves in desert areas around the arid city. According to an Amnesty International report, 370 young women and girl were killed in Ciudad Juarez between 1993 and 2005. Most of the slayings remain unsolved. Mexicans are very familiar with La Diana Cazadora, as it's known in Spanish. A stone monument of the Roman goddess, nude, long-haired and holding a bow, stands on Mexico City's Reforma Avenue, a major thoroughfare. A replica was erected in Ciudad Juarez. Journalist Edgar Roman in Ciudad Juarez contributed to this report.","Two Ciudad Juarez bus drivers were slain last month by an unidentified woman .

"(CNN) -- Last summer an EF3 tornado ripped through my town, Monson, Massachusetts. There is a very particular feeling of vulnerability you experience in such a violent storm. You crouch in a dark basement, the windows explode inwards, and you have no idea if the groaning beams will hold. We had no directly storm-related deaths in Monson, despite the rarity of a tornado in our region. We were prepared, whether through federal programs or memory of the movie Twister, to shelter and ride out the storm. The tornado took its toll -- more than 270 homes in Monson sustained damage. My own was rendered unlivable, our family displaced for a year. We weren't ready for recovery, however. During a painful period, our community learned how to manage volunteers and donations, track data, apply for grants and request aid through official channels. We bumbled through the early days, doing things wrong and wasting time. Eventually a system emerged, coordinated largely by the First Church of Monson and a few dedicated local volunteers. But why did we have to build that system on our own? Though we were prepared to survive the storm, why hadn't someone prepared us for recovery? Baffled by the acute lack of community recovery tools, my sister and I decided to build them. We put together a team and built an in-kind resource management system for untrained local organizers. We have been working with communities and emergency managers across the country to deploy the system through our company, Recovers.org. TED.com: The oil spill's unseen culprits, victims . Most disaster preparedness programs concentrate on preparing residents to take care of themselves and their families for the first 72 hours following a disaster. A less frequent focus is how to prepare local residents to take care of their communities during the months and years of recovery that will follow. Organizing at the local level does not require a membership card -- there are things each of us can do locally to speed recovery. In the first few days post-disaster, scores of organizations will sweep in and out of an affected area, assessing damage, providing emergency aid, mobilizing teams of volunteers. In most areas, however, there is an often-overlooked community response working alongside these organizations. These folks are usually poorly equipped and hastily organized. Their qualifications? They live here. They were here before the aid. They will be here meeting needs when everyone else goes home. Disaster recovery is changing in the United States. While large aid organizations like the Red Cross and Salvation Army can mobilize massive amounts of crucial resources, they often do not manage spontaneous donations, track local volunteer hours, or stay long term. It is the local church, or library, or the city manager that ends up matching those with needs with aid long term. They do it on Post-It notes, or Facebook, but they get it done. Ordinary people (read: you) are realizing that they are both allowed and are needed to respond. TED.com: Reporting crisis via texting . Community-powered recovery is simple, and it happens everywhere. I point to tornado recovery in Joplin, Missouri; the Broadmoor neighborhood in New Orleans following Katrina; and the small town of Forney, Texas, after an EF3 tornado. In each area, local efforts were instrumental to overall recovery. The problem here is one of planning: Each of these community efforts was seat-of-the-pants, as they'll readily admit. If community in each case was such an integral part of the recovery, why weren't they written into the plan? Beyond local labor, the most neglected facet of disaster recovery is local data. Outside aid organizations usually activate their own resources and trained volunteers. They will often turn away spontaneous untrained volunteers or unsolicited donation items. Unfortunately, this also means that unless local organizers are efficiently using these resources, they go to waste. After a disaster, you normally have roughly seven days (fewer in small disasters) of media interest in which you can collect aid. If you don't have a system for recording the names and contact information of people who would like to donate or volunteer until Week 2, you've missed out on perhaps 50% of all resources that will ever be reported. To aid your community, you have to plan ahead, not just for the first 72 hours, but for the next few years of needs. TED.com: What's left to explore? As we begin to respond to the damage from Hurricane Isaac, these are things to keep in mind. New Orleans has seen this before, and has systems in place to accept volunteers and donations. Recovery from Isaac will not be easy, but it will be much faster because they are ""prepared"" to handle resources. Here are a few tips for getting involved at the community level: . Community Organizers: . • Get smart: It is not as simple as setting up a shade tent, or just directing people where to go. Sending a 17-year-old into the woods with a chainsaw is asking for a lawsuit. If you are going to get involved with recovery, you have to do so responsibly, with the safety and well-being of both survivors and volunteers as your priority. • Get a system: Speak to your area's emergency manager about what kind of information they will need you to collect. If they need to know how many hours were worked on Carpenter Street, you need to be tracking that information! • Use the web: But don't expect everyone to. You may be a Twitter whiz, but you need to be prepared to spread information on a regular web page, paper, or by word of mouth. You can help your emergency manager by spreading their information through your social media stream. Affected Households: . • Document everything: from photos of the damage, to the names of the caseworkers you speak to in different organizations -- and keep records of what is going on. • Look for help proactively: Many homeowners spend out insurance money on things like toiletries, while boxes of donated goods sit unused in local churches. Volunteers: . • Don't be a hero: Your intentions are good, but no one on the ground in the affected community is ready for you in the first 72 hours post-disaster. If you show up too early, you could even be endangering yourself. • Stand and be counted: The dollar value of hours you work can count toward the amount of aid FEMA grants the community. If you want to volunteer, make sure you are working with an organizer that tracks your hours. Donors: . • Listen before you bring: Are you trying to donate a refrigerator? Does the church you're bringing it to really have space to store it until it is needed? Call ahead and ask what is needed, or check out local information pages. • Protect yourself: If you post what you would like to donate publicly, everyone sees it. For example, you may have just informed the world that you have an extra big screen TV and fine china lying around in your basement. Find a local organization that needs the items and donate through them.

"New York (CNN) -- New York's Court of Appeals ruled Thursday that New York City's ban on large sugary drinks, which was previously blocked by lower courts, is illegal. ""We hold that the New York City Board of Health, in adopting the 'Sugary Drinks Portion Cap Rule,' exceeded the scope of its regulatory authority,"" the ruling said. Christopher Gindlesperger, a spokesman for the American Beverage Association, praised the ruling. ""We are pleased that the lower courts' decisions were upheld,"" he said in a statement. ""It would have created an uneven playing field for thousands of small businesses in the city and limited New Yorkers' freedom of choice. With this ruling behind us, we look forward to collaborating with city leaders on solutions that will have a meaningful and lasting impact on New Yorkers and families across the country."" Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg had pushed for the ban on sugary drinks larger than 16 ounces as a way to fight obesity and other health problems. In a statement, Bloomberg's successor, Mayor Bill de Blasio, expressed disappointment with the decision.

"(CNN) -- The only criminal charge to come out of the academic fraud scandal at the University of North Carolina has been dropped. Orange County District Attorney Jim Woodall announced on Thursday that ex-professor Julius Nyang'oro would no longer be facing a felony fraud charge. He was accused of taking money to teach classes that didn't exist. Woodall said the decision was based on Nyang'oro's cooperation, both with the criminal investigation, which is over, and the university-sanctioned investigation being done by former federal prosecutor Ken Wainstein. Wainstein was hired this year by UNC to do another internal investigation, since past investigations pinning the sole blame on Nyang'oro have not satisfied questions and curiosity from the community and from critics of UNC who think the scope of the fake classes was much bigger than UNC admits. The so called ""paper classes"" scandal involves hundreds of classes that never met and required little work, and even though many athletes were enrolled in them, UNC and the NCAA have been criticized for saying the issue had nothing to do with athletics. That all makes the cooperation of Nyang'oro a game-changer in the quest to find answers, and Woodall said last week that is the reason he had been considering dropping the charges. He said he felt it was better for the community to understand who else knew about the fake classes and who created them than it was for one professor to be punished criminally. ""Even though it's a noncriminal investigation, that is more important than this,"" Woodall said, referring to Wainstein's review. Nyang'oro's cooperation also led to the NCAA announcing it would reopen its investigation into academic fraud at UNC. It previously had found no athletic scandal. But in the last few months, a flurry of reporting has called that into question. Several athletes have said they were pushed into the fake classes by athletic advisers, and whistle-blower Mary Willingham has said that many star athletes were kept eligible by taking the classes. ""That's not just Julius Nyang'oro,"" Willingham said. ""It's what we, the university, used to keep athletes eligible and that just is the truth."" Willingham was a UNC employee who told reporters about the classes. She has since quit her job and filed suit against the university. Wainstein said Nyang'oro's cooperation has been very valuable. ""He has answered all of our questions regarding the academic and athletic dimensions of the irregular courses offered in the department of African and Afro-American Studies, and he has provided important insights and information we would otherwise not have received,"" Wainstein said. Wainstein said last week that his team has so far collected 1.5 million e-mails and documents, talked to 30 people in the athletic-academic areas of UNC and is looking at athlete transcripts going back to the 1980s. That's something no other UNC investigation had done. ""UNC is the mother of all academic fraud violations,"" said Gerald Gurney, president of the Drake Group for Academic Integrity in College Sport. ""...Theres no doubt in my mind about cooperation of friendly faculty and the cover-up and the excuses of this kind of behavior that has gone on in the university. ... It's egregious. ""It's quite likely that if it is shown that this is a long-term systematic scheme on the part of the university that UNC will need to vacate wins,"" Gurney said.

"(CNN) -- Two 5-year-old boys, one with autism, were having some friendly playtime when they had a communication breakdown. One boy didn't respond to the other and walked away. The ignored kid got frustrated and pushed over a small staircase, causing the first boy to fall. Their speech therapist, Jordan Sadler, decided to address the issue by recreating it in an iPad app called Puppet Pals. She restaged the scenario as a movie, even taking photos of the room for the background and of the kids for the characters. Using the app to show an instant replay of the scuffle, Sadler and the kids identified what went wrong and then recreated the scene, this time making better decisions. Creating custom stories to help kids learn communication skills or understand complex situations is just one of the ways parents, therapists and educators have taken advantage of tablets to work with kids with autism. How do you communicate with a loved one with autism? Tablets as tools, not miracles . When the iPad made its debut in 2010, it was hailed as something of a miracle device and there was a rush among parents of kids with autism to get the $499 gadget. ""They were throwing them at their kids expecting miracles, but it didn't happen. The reason is they are tools, not miracles,"" said Shannon Rosa, an author and former educational software producer who has written about using tablets with her own son, Leo, who has autism. ""I think a lot of parents now are more realistic about the level of support that is needed to help kids use them."" Four years later, tablets still play a big role in the autism community. But the expectations for the technology have come down to earth a bit. Now app creators, autism educators and parents are exploring new ways of using tablets and apps to work with the 1 in 68 kids in the U.S. with autism. They've had time to discover what works best for kids with autism when it comes to tablets. The uses vary from child to child, and often the best apps aren't even created with kids with autism in mind. Rosa said it allows her son, now 13, to think visually, to interact with content directly without the cognitive hurdle of a mouse, and it breaks complex concepts up into more easily understandable chunks. Siri is even helping him with articulation. The tablet has also given him more independence. Leo used to have a really hard time figuring out what to do with himself when someone didn't structure his day for him. Now he can use the iPad on his own and have a good time independently. Rosa, though, like many parents, is careful about letting her son have too much screen time. Sadler gives iPad workshops all over the country, teaching people about the most effective ways to use the device. She tries to move parents away from using mobile devices as a reward, letting children just play games or watch YouTube videos. She encourages parents to seek out dynamic apps that can help with the core challenges of autism while also being fun. ""It's really important to learn and improve social communication skills,"" said Sadler. ""But it has to be something that grabs them."" Mixing laughter and lessons . Flummox and Friends is a hybrid of an app and a TV show for kids on the autism spectrum that seeks to be more than just educational or just entertaining. Released on the iPad in April, it's a live-action comedy show that aims to educate children by being entertaining, not condescending. The main characters are inventors and their friends, and they're written so children with autism can relate to them. They find themselves in tricky situations that they need to invent their way out of. The idea is to teach social and emotional skills through funny plots. Using pop-up prompts, the app sets up situations that kids with autism may have trouble with, such as anticipating someone else's perspective, managing someone else's emotions, and being flexible instead of being rigid. A scene might show some of the ways communications can break down, then walk the viewer through ways to fix the problem. ""Typically, how this stuff has been taught is giving kids scripts saying, 'Say this when you meet someone,'"" said the show's creator, Christa Dahlstrom. ""It's kind of suggesting (they) aren't doing this right and need to be normal."" Flummox and Friends is geared more toward acceptance, and Dahlstrom is interested in working with the kids whose minds are wired differently, not correcting them. The app reflects a larger shift in the community away from ""fixing"" autism to accepting and embracing it. ""(Technology) can make a profound difference to the kids with autism, but it's not like it's a cure for it,"" Dahlstrom said. ""You've got to stop thinking of this as a parental problem."" Dahlstrom, who has worked in learning design her whole career, has observed firsthand how her own 10-year-old son with autism learns and what he struggles with. She noticed that he tends to open up when people are laughing, having fun and quoting TV shows. After realizing comedy could be a great tool for reaching children with autism, she started a Kickstarter campaign to raise money for the first Flummox and Friends episode. The show is meant to appeal to 6- to 12-year-olds, which is a slightly older audience than most autism apps. ""In terms of apps for kids with autism and special needs, there's a lot of stuff for preschoolers. There's not as much when you start going up to an older audience, especially when it comes to social skills,"" she said. The multi-purpose rectangle . Tablets have replaced a number of other tools for parents and educators, including handmade visual aids, expensive communication devices and, increasingly, TVs. The gadgets are a more affordable alternative to the dedicated augmented-communication devices some nonverbal kids use to communicate. Those can cost between $6,000 and $8,000, but with a tablet, kids who aren't speaking can use voice-output apps instead. Teachers and therapists no longer have to slog through the mundane task of making visual tools. Making cue cards is a common technique when working with nonverbal children, but it requires taking photos, uploading them to computers, printing them out, laminating them, adding some velcro and sticking them on boards. The addition of a camera in the second version made the process even easier. ""It really sort of took us out of the dark ages in terms of how quickly we could make visual supports for the kids and how quickly kids could access what they wanted,"" said Sadler. One thing that makes Flummox and Friends unusual is that it is a fully scripted TV show delivered as an app. Tablets give kids much more control than they have with a TV. They can hold a tablet in their hands and have a more intimate experience with a story or game. Watching clips and shows repeatedly is common among children with autism, and with tablets they can rewatch favorite segments over and over. ""We've really started to see children's media migrate from the TV screen to the iPad,"" said Dahlstrom.","Four years after iPad debuted, the autism community is still exploring how to use tablets .

"(CNN) -- After months of turmoil in Europe's financial markets, Greece has an opportunity to do something that just a few weeks ago would have seemed incomprehensible -- knock Germany out of the Euro. Not the single currency, of course, but Euro 2012 -- the competition that pits the continent's best soccer teams against each other. Friday's quarterfinal clash is being heralded as the ultimate grudge match after months of wrangling over the future of Europe's economy, and Germany's insistence on sweeping austerity measures in Greece after providing the bulk of its bailout money. Though the recent rivalry has been provoked by matters of finance, the suffering endured during Nazi occupation in World War II has left many Greeks with strong anti-German feelings. It is far from the first time political and sporting lines have become blurred, even in the current European Championship tournament. Economic turmoil has 'affected' Greece at Euro 2012 . Poland's group match with Russia last week provoked running battles on the streets of Warsaw as fans from both nations transported historical tensions to the modern day. Fighting started after city officials sanctioned a Russian national day march before the game. Joseph Stalin's Russia occupied Poland shortly after the outbreak of World War II, and the Communist regime's influence extended for many years. Even inside the National Stadium last Tuesday, away fans unfurled a banner that read ""This is Russia"" -- infuriating Polish supporters. Perhaps the most notorious case of football fanning the flames of political dispute came when a World Cup qualification clash between Honduras and El Salvador sparked a four-day war in 1969. The Latin American neighbors had been at odds over issues of migration and land reform, and the two legs prompted angry clashes between fans. Greece star focused on football . This, in turn, led to skirmishes on the border before Salvador launched bombing raids. Four days later a ceasefire deal was clinched. At the World Cup in 1998, the United States and Iran met in a combustible fixture that those involved claimed did more for relations between the two countries than 20 years of infrequent political dialogue. A 2008 clash between North and South Korea had to be contested in China after the North refused to play its neighbor's anthem or fly its flag before the World Cup qualifier. After the return game in Seoul in 2009, the South's victory was followed by the North's accusations of tactical food poisoning. Perhaps the most politically-charged games of football ever to take place came in 1974 when East Germany met West Germany at the World Cup. The nation was still divided after World War II, and proved the staging post for years of Cold War tensions between Russia and the West. East Germany forward Jurgen Sparwasser scored the only goal of the game but West Germany had the last laugh, going on to win the tournament on home soil. Germany's games against the Netherlands also prove to be a hotbed of hostility, which has its roots in World War II and Nazi occupation. Former Dutch coach Rinus Michels summed up the rivalry between the two nations prior to their 1974 World Cup final clash when he said ""football is war."" Midfielder Willem van Hanegem went one step further, reportedly saying: ""I don't like Germans. Every time I played against German players. I had a problem because of the war."" War was also the backdrop for England's meeting with Argentina in the 1986 World Cup, coming just four years after the countries had finished fighting in the Falklands Islands. The match was immortalized forever by Diego Maradona's handball goal, which he later said was scored by the ""Hand of God."" He claimed in his autobiography the goal was revenge for the Falklands conflict in 1982, when Britain bombarded the islands after Argentina's invasion and occupation of the disputed territory. The fledgling nations of Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina clashed on the pitch and in the stands when they met in 2008 just a few years after the end of a brutal war. And in North Africa, a World Cup playoff between Egypt and Algeria in 2009 saw both nations recall their ambassadors when team buses were stoned and fans repeatedly clashed on the streets.

"Washington (CNN) -- In the battle for the Senate, nine races will play a role in determining the balance of power. Democrats currently hold six of the seats while Republicans hold the other two, meaning that the Democrats must defend their territory -- a difficult task in a midterm election with a Democratic president who has low approval ratings. Here's a short synopsis of the key races that Democrats are working to keep in their hands: . Alaska: Sen. Mark Begich is another freshman senator who is facing a difficult road to reelection. He won his last race by fewer than 4,000 votes in the red state. He is distancing himself from President Barack Obama and touting his pro-energy credentials. He could face one of three Republicans. Their primary is August 19. Arkansas: This is one of the most Republican states in the country. President Barack Obama received only 37% of the vote in 2012 and Sen. Mark Pryor is locked in a race with Rep. Tom Cotton, a Republican backed by both conservative and establishment elements of the Republican Party. Louisiana: Since her first Senate race in 1996, Sen. Mary Landrieu has had a tough road to election. Now running for her fourth term, Republicans are still trying to unseat the centrist Democrat. This year she will face off against one of several Republican challengers, including Rep. Bill Cassidy, who is considered her biggest threat. Louisiana runs its elections a little differently. November 4, Election Day for the rest of the country, is considered Louisiana's primary. And if no candidate receives 50% of the vote, a runoff takes place December 6. Michigan: Long-time Sen. Carl Levin is retiring, giving Republicans their first chance to take a seat in Michigan since 1994. Republican Terry Lynn Land is staging a competitive race against Democratic Rep. Gary Peters. House and Senate key races to watch . Montana: Cook Political Report categorizes this race as ""lean Republican."" Sen. John Walsh is running as an incumbent, appointed to the seat after Max Baucus left to become ambassador to China, but that status is thin in the conservative state as he's only been in office since February. Rep. Steve Daines is the likely Republican candidate. North Carolina: Sen. Kay Hagan is running for her second term. It's still unclear who she will face in the November election as Republicans are battling it out for that party's nomination. But her likely challenger is state House Speaker Thom Tillis. While she will have to run against her Republican opponent, she also will have to run against her public perception as she faces approval ratings of only 35%, according to an April 8 High Point University/University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill poll. Iowa: Sen. Tom Harkin's retirement opens the seat up to a possible Republican win. Rep. Bruce Braley will be the Democratic candidate and the Republican field is crowded. But if no GOP candidate obtains 35% support in the primary, then the candidate is chosen by a conservative state convention. Republicans are also playing in Colorado and New Hampshire, which means they have multiple paths to retaking the Senate. But Republicans are defending two key seats that could make it more difficult for them to pick up the majority. Kentucky: Republican leader Mitch McConnell is in the race of his life. He is being attacked by the tea party wing of the party with a challenger, Matt Bevin, who he's likely to beat in the May 20 primary. Then Democrats have a legitimate chance in the red state with their candidate, Alison Lundergan Grimes. Georgia: The current Republican senator, Saxby Chambliss, is retiring, leaving his seat vulnerable. Michelle Nunn comes from a family steeped in Georgia politics and is proving to be a viable Democratic candidate in this red state. Over on the GOP side, the candidates are beating each other up in a contentious primary and pushing each other further to the right, which could leave the primary winner bruised and too extreme for a general election electorate. Additionally, primary candidates must win more than 50% of the vote to avoid a runoff. With the crowded field, a runoff is possible, adding another challenging element to Republican efforts to keep this seat.

"(CNN) -- Concerns about the Ebola virus were heightened Sunday when a health care worker in Texas had a positive preliminary test for the disease. The worker's case marks the first known transmission of Ebola in the United States and the second diagnosis in the country. With developments pouring in from all corners of the world, here's what you need to know to quickly get caught up: . U.S. CASES . New case in Texas: . A person who helped to treat Thomas Eric Duncan may be the first person to contract the disease while in the United States. The health care worker from Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital tested positive in a preliminary test Saturday after reporting a low-grade fever Friday. The CDC is working to confirm the diagnosis. CDC head says protocols work: . Dr. Tom Frieden, the director of the CDC, told reporters Sunday that the health care worker who appears to have contracted in Ebola was infected because of a breach in protocols. He mentioned that one of the times that people working in protective clothing are at risk is when they are taking off their gear, but he said CDC investigators are working to determine what happened. ""The protocols work. ... But we know that even a single lapse or breach can result in infection,"" he said. NBC cameraman's condition improving: . Doctors at a Nebraska hospital are pleased with the progress being made by NBC cameraman Ashoka Mukpo, who contracted Ebola while working in Liberia. Mukpo, an American citizen, is receiving an experimental drug called brincidofovir, or CMX001. ""With the Ebola virus, you never relax completely, but we think he has made great progress,"" said Dr. Phil Smith with The Nebraska Medical Center, where Mukpo is being treated. Earlier, Smith had said that Mukpo's condition had ""slightly improved."" ""He's been taking in some fluids and drinking Gatorade. But everyone needs to be reminded that this is still a very serious illness we're dealing with and no one has a lot of experience treating it,"" Smith said. Meanwhile, the NBC crew that had been with Mukpo -- and had made an agreement to voluntarily self-confine themselves -- apparently broke its word. ""Unfortunately, the NBC crew violated this agreement and so the Department of Health Friday evening issued a mandatory quarantine order to ensure that the crew will remain confined until October 22,"" the New Jersey Department of Health said in a statement. ""The NBC crew remains symptom-free, so there is no reason for concern of exposure to the community,"" it read. Massachusetts patient exhibits possible Ebola symptoms: . A patient who has been to Liberia presented himself Sunday at a medical center in Braintree, Massachusetts, complaining of headache and muscle aches. ""Out of an abundance of caution, we immediately notified authorities and the patient was securely removed from the building and put into an ambulance now headed to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. The building was closed briefly but has now reopened,"" Ben Kruskal, chief of infectious disease at Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates, said in a statement. Lab samples have to sent to the CDC for Ebola testing, said Kelly Lawman, spokeswoman for Beth Israel Deaconess. The medical center later issued a statement that said the patient does not appear to be at high risk for Ebola, and the likelihood the patient has the disease is ""extremely low."" New travel screening: . Five of America's biggest, busiest airports are beefing up measures. On Saturday, people arriving from the three nations hardest hit by Ebola started getting special screening, including having their temperature taken, at New York's JFK airport. ""That screening went smoothly,"" Frieden said Sunday. ""There are a lot of lessons being learned through that to make sure that screening goes smoothly for passengers, other passengers."" Washington's Dulles, Newark, Chicago's O'Hare and Atlanta international airports will begin screening Thursday. Cuban doctors train, then fight Ebola in Africa . WEST AFRICA . No relief in sight: . The number of deaths attributed to the current Ebola outbreak has climbed to 4,033, the World Health Organization reported Friday. The tally brings the total number of confirmed, probable and suspected cases of Ebola to 8,399. The numbers were reported from Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Spain and the United States. Complete coverage on Ebola . U.S. troops arrive in Liberia: . A group of 90 U.S. Marines and airmen arrived in Liberia on Thursday to help Ebola response efforts, along with four V-22 Osprey aircraft and two C-130 transport planes. Their arrival brings the total number of U.S. troops deployed in Liberia to 334, military spokesman Lt. Col. Dave Doherty said. There are more coming. In late October, 700 troops from the 101st Airborne Division are scheduled to deploy to Liberia. U.S. troops battle invisible enemy in Liberia . IN OTHER COUNTRIES . Spain Ebola patient has no significant change in condition: . Teresa Romero Ramos, a nurse's assistant in Spain who is the first person to contract Ebola outside Africa, ""is conscious and talking"" but was in ""stable but serious"" condition Saturday after taking a turn for the worse earlier in the week. She has been treated with the anti-influenza drug Avigan, hospital sources with knowledge of the case said. Sporadic infections unavoidable, the WHO says: . Sporadic Ebola infections will be unavoidable in some European countries because of direct travel from their hubs to hotspot areas in West Africa, the World Health Organization said Wednesday. But the risk of spread, it said, is avoidable and extremely low. United Kingdom: . The UK's Heathrow and Gatwick airports and Eurostar railway terminals will begin screening passengers arriving from Ebola-affected Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, a government spokesman said. Screening will involve assessing passengers' recent travel history, who they have been in contact with and future travel arrangements, as well as a possible assessment performed by medical personnel. CNN's Steve Almasy, Joe Sutton, Ray Sanchez, Greg Botelho, Alexander Felton, Khushbu Shah, Saskya Vandoorne, Richard Quest, Brent Swails and Nima Elbagir contributed to this report.","NEW: Massachusetts patient does not appear to be at high risk for Ebola .

"(CNN) -- Lake Urmia in Iran used to be a site to reckon with. Twenty years ago, it ranked as the sixth largest saltwater lake in the world, and the largest in the Middle East. Tourists would revel in the lake's buoyancy (like the Dead Sea, the salt level made it impossible to sink), and the flocks of flamingos, pelicans and yellow deer that once inhabited the surrounding areas. Today, Urmia is a shadow of its former self. Decades of poor water management, aggressive agricultural policies and drought have rendered it almost completely dried up (according to the United Nations Development Program, the lake has shrunk by two-thirds since 1997). Rusted boats lay abandoned in what is now essentially a giant salt flat. The tourists are long gone, as are many of the animals that once called the lake home. ""It's like seeing a scene from a different planet. I saw caterpillars and bobcats taking salt from the dead body of the lake,"" recalls Gary Lewis, the United Nations Resident Coordinator in Iran. ""It's a testament to how rapidly we can break something."" It's a problem that President Hassan Rouhani is aware of, and one he wants to fix. Last month, he agreed to spend $500 million in the first year alone of a ten-year recovery plan (the total bill is $5 billion). ""If the lake dries up, this kind of threat will not be comparable to any other threat,"" he said in a public statement in January. It's not an overblown statement. According to experts, Iran is on the brink of a water crisis. ""In the year 1956, the per capita water available in Iran was 7,000 cubic meters. Today, it is 1,900 cubic meters. In the year 2020, it is likely to be only 1,300 cubic meters,"" says Lewis. The estimates fall far short of the 30 million cubic meters he believes will be needed to accommodate the burgeoning population -- which could reach 90 million in the next decade. Shortages are cited throughout the country, not just at Lake Urmia, but in the Hamoun Wetlands in the east of the country -- a one-time oasis surrounded by fishing villages that has since dried up. In 2012 alone, the Hamoun water crisis sent 600,000 environmental refugees into the north of the country. Lewis worries that as water shortages become the norm, not only will Iran face repercussions to the economy and public health, but that it will start to have a knock-on effect on the Middle East as a whole. ""People are vulnerable when they migrate. When they come crashing into someone else's neighborhood, they become a threat to those people's economic security. Add in ethnic or linguistic differences, and that can be a real source of conflict,"" he says. A new Iran? Iran is doing more than throwing money at the problem. In March, Iran's Department of Environment, together with the UNDP, held a conference with hundreds of international experts on how to solve Iran's water shortage problem, and ultimately approved 24 separate projects. ""When Rouhani took power, in the first government meeting, he ordered the formation of a special group to save Urmia and the other dying wetlands,"" recalls Naser Agh, a professor at the Artemia and Aquatic Animals Research Institute at Urmia University, and a member of the steering committee of the Lake Urmia restoration program. The mission to save the lake is complex, and Agh admits that even in ten years, it will only restore Urmia to half its original size. ""No single measure can help the lake. Lots of things have to be done at the same time,"" he says. The influx of money and manpower demonstrates a sizable shift in how the new administration is addressing the problem -- partly, in that they're willing to address it at all. Thus far, Iran's environmental record has been pretty poor. The country is the world's ninth top producer of greenhouse gasses, according to according to the US Energy Information Administration, and is home to the world's eighth most polluted city. ""The past government would say we needed to save the lake, and would even form a national committee and ministers would come together, but there was never a budget, and without a budget, you can't do anything,"" says Agh. ""This new government is very different. They also approved a large amount of money, so it can really help save the lake.""","Lake Urmia was once one of the world's largest lakes .
Over the last 20 years it has almost completely dried up .
Iran's water crisis puts security, the economy and public health at risk .

"(CNN) -- The bad news kept piling on the National Football League on Wednesday with the arrest of an Arizona Cardinals player. Police in Phoenix arrested Jonathan Dwyer after practice on multiple allegations of felony assault. It was the latest public relations blow for the most popular sports league in America, which has been the subject of public scorn and scrutiny after half a dozen players recently got into trouble or were disciplined. Here is a quick look at those players and their travails. Adrian Peterson . One of the top players in the NFL, he left the Minnesota Vikings on Wednesday to deal with child abuse accusations in Texas. Peterson had been deactivated by the Vikings and missed Sunday's game, then reactivated Monday. But the team said it needed to correct its mistake and deactivated him again. Peterson then took a leave of absence and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell placed him on the exempt list, which gives the team the opportunity to continue to pay him while he deals with his legal issues. At no point has Peterson been suspended. Greg Hardy . The Carolina Panthers' defensive star also took a leave of absence because of legal troubles. As with Peterson, Hardy will be paid while he is away from the team. Hardy was convicted by a judge in July on misdemeanor assault charges. He asked for a new trial in front of a jury, which is scheduled for mid-November. Hardy played one game then was deactivated as the outrage against the NFL grew over how it was dealing with domestic violence issues. He has proclaimed his innocence of the charges, which were filed after police said he assaulted his then-girlfriend and threatened to kill her. He was sentenced to 18 months probation and a 60-day suspended . Jonathan Dwyer . The most recent player to be arrested, the running back is alleged to have assaulted a 27-year-old woman and an 18-month-old child. A Phoenix police spokesman, Sgt. Trent Crump, said it would be reckless to identify the victims. Dwyer, 25, was spending Wednesday night in the Maricopa County jail and the Arizona Cardinals deactivated him. He won't be able to take part in any team activities, if he is released from jail. Crump said two incidents were reported by neighbors in July. The woman didn't allege any violence until last week when she called from another state, where she had moved with the child. The most serious of six charges were three counts of assault, one of which caused a fracture. Dwyer was being held in the Maricopa County Jail and couldn't comment. CNN's attempt to reach his agent was unsuccessful. Ray Rice . The running back without a team is appealing his indefinite suspension by the league. While Rice has called punching his future wife in the head and knocking her out ""inexcusable,"" he is seeking to have the opportunity to play in the NFL again. The players' union has complained that Rice didn't receive due process from Goodell, who suspended him in June to a two-game ban, then increased the penalty to an indefinite suspension. That came earlier this month after TMZ Sports posted a video that showed the punch. Rice was three days away from completing the original suspension when the indefinite ban was handed down and when the Baltimore Ravens terminated his contract. Ray McDonald . Three days after Goodell created a new NFL policy against domestic violence on August 28, San Francisco 49ers defensive tackle Ray McDonald was arrested on an accusation of felony domestic violence. The new policy imposes a minimum six-game unpaid ban for first-time offenders and up to a lifetime ban for second-time offenders. No charges have been filed in the incident involving McDonald. Neither the team nor the league has levied any discipline in the case and the starter at left defensive tackle played the first two games of the season. Quincy Enunwa . The Jets practice squad player's arrest went practically overlooked outside of the New York area. According to USA Today's ""NFL Players Arrests"" tracker, he was arrested September 4. Enunwa was charged with simple assault after a woman told police he pulled her off a bed at a hotel, causing her a head injury, ESPNNewYork.com reported. He pleaded not guilty, ESPN said, adding that the player was still practicing with the team.","The National Football League has seen several of its players appear in mug shots .
Two of those players took leave on Wednesday .
The day also brought another arrest in a new domestic violence investigation ."
"(CNN) -- A Florida man shot and killed his daughter and six grandchildren Thursday afternoon in the small north-central Florida town of Bell in what authorities called a murder-suicide. Gilchrist County Sheriff Robert Schultz identified the shooter as Don Spirit, 51, and the daughter as Sarah Spirit, 28. The sheriff told reporters the children -- three boys and three girls -- ranged in age from 3 months to 11 years. The sheriff wouldn't disclose what kind of firearm was used. Schultz said Don Spirit, who called 911 around 4 p.m., killed himself after a deputy arrived on the scene. The deputy found the bodies inside the home. Deputies had previously responded to calls from the home, owned by Spirit, on ""numerous"" occasions, officials said. Spirit had a criminal history, Schultz said, without elaborating. The sheriff said the news would devastate the county, which has about 17,000 residents. ""We're all family here,"" he said. In 2003, the Orlando Sentinel reported that Spirit was sentenced to three years in prison after he accidentally killed his son Kyle in a hunting accident two years prior. Spirit was charged with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and pleaded guilty, the newspaper reported at the time. Florida criminal records show Spirit was released from prison in February 2006. Bell is about 30 miles west of Gainesville. Florida community reels after mom kills son, daughter, self .

"(CNN) -- Before most Americans had heard of Devyani Khobragade, Indian officials were already giving the world's superpower a good drubbing. Politicians from left and right refused to meet with a visiting U.S. congressional delegation in New Delhi as uproar over the Indian diplomat's arrest and strip search consumed all of India. Here's what Narendra Modi, a leader from the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party, tweeted: . ""Refused to meet the visiting USA delegation in solidarity with our nation, protesting ill-treatment meted to our lady diplomat in USA."" So how is it that one diplomat's troubles resulted in a massive international row between the world's most populous democracy and its most powerful one? Why is the arrest of one woman threatening to seriously damage warm relations between the two allies? ""There is a lot of protest in India. I personally believe they are politically motivated,"" Aseem Chhabra, a columnist for Mumbai Mirror newspaper, told CNN. ""We have elections coming up in May."" Chhabra pointed to the refusal to meet with the U.S. delegation as political grandstanding. ""Clearly this becomes an election statement: 'Look, we are standing up against the U.S.,'"" Chhabra said. Indian External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid told parliament that there were larger issues at stake. ""It is no longer about an individual. It is about our sense of self as a nation and our place in the world,"" he said to usually bickering politicians who have displayed rare unity on this incident. Khobragade, India's deputy consul general in New York, was arrested and strip-searched last week on charges of visa fraud related to her treatment of maid and nanny Sangeeta Richard. India claims U.S. marshals overstepped their bounds in their treatment of a diplomat. Indian officials retaliated quickly by removing security barriers outside the U.S. Embassy in Delhi and revoking diplomatic identification cards. People took to the streets to protest what they perceived as American bullying. U.S. authorities claim their job is to uphold the law and hold violators accountable, no matter who they might be. Indian diplomat: Does she have immunity? This is not the first time an Indian official has had an encounter with American law. In recent years, former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam was told to remove his shoes at airport security. Indian Ambassador Meera Shanker got a pat-down, and India's permanent representative to the United Nations, Hardeep Puri, was detained after he refused to take off his turban, also at an airport. Not much was made of those incidents. But this time, the consensus is that a lot of people may be spewing hyper anti-Americanism for pure political gain. Such sentiment has existed in India since the days following independence in 1947 and the country's formation of a strong alliance with the Soviet Union. ""There's a Cold War legacy when India was at odds with the United States over a range of issues,"" said political scientist Sumit Ganguly. The Cold War residue surfaces from time to time. And this seems to be one of those times -- when that particular message is playing well. A patriotic stance abroad is helping drum up support for politicians at home before critical parliamentary elections in May, said Ganguly, affiliated with the School of Global and International Studies at the University of Indiana. ""All of these people are trying to demonstrate how tough they can be, how nationalistic they can be, how concerned they are about this woman,"" he said. ""They are engaged in high drama. If Narendra Modi says it's terrible, then Rahul Gandhi has to say it's despicable."" Gandhi, a leader of the ruling Congress Party, is a potential prime ministerial candidate. At the heart of this case is diplomat Khobragade's treatment of Richard, her maid and nanny. It's an issue that has been trumped -- perhaps intentionally -- by the politics swirling about this case, Ganguly said. Court documents show that Khobragade lied in a visa application, promising to pay her domestic helper minimum wage of $9.75 an hour even though the actual salary was much less -- $3.31 an hour. Khobragade allegedly instructed the housekeeper to say she would be paid the higher rate and not mention her actual pay. Opinion: What about the nanny? Domestic workers are often underpaid and abused in India, and human rights advocates have been frustrated that the focus of the Khobragade scandal has been on politics rather than the alleged crime. ""Something we don't want to talk about or think about is how we treat domestic workers. For God's sake, we treat them like chattel,"" Ganguly said. ""This is a national shame we have not confronted."" In the meantime, global observers worry about the widened rift between India and the United States. Nicholas Burns, former U.S. undersecretary for political affairs, considers India one of American's most important allies. ""Hopefully this can be diffused so we can go back to working on the very important issues on our agenda,"" he said. Ganguly said Indians need to check what he views as their overreaction. ""It's very poorly thought out. This is the most foolish and petulant behavior,"" he said. Ganguly said he feared the Khobragde incident has the potential to be quite damaging. ""I think U.S. patience will run out at some point,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- India and the United States have become embroiled in a full-scale diplomatic row involving the case of Devyani Khobragade, an Indian diplomat who was arrested last week and charged with visa fraud by U.S. authorities. Prosecutors claim she imported and employed an Indian housekeeper to whom she paid only a small fraction of her promised wages. After Khobragade's arrest, she was strip-searched in a private setting by a female U.S. marshal. This in particular caused a firestorm of criticism in India, though prosecutors and police claim all standard procedures were followed and that Khobragade was even given special considerations due to her diplomatic status. OPINION: U.S. actually owes India apology over strip-search . While the courts will eventually resolve the welter of claims and counterclaims -- even the most basic facts in the case are currently in dispute and the diplomat's attorney says the charges are false -- it is clear that this arrest was the result of an investigation lasting several months. Given the sensitivity of arresting a diplomat representing a major U.S. ally, it seems likely that prosecutors feel that the case against Khobragade is very strong. However, even without being able to determine Khobragade's guilt or innocence with respect to the charges, l'affaire Khobragade shines an unflattering light on several elements of India's diplomacy and its politics of privilege. First, whether or not the charges and manner of arrest were proper, the intemperate reaction of the Indian government in response shows that, despite its status as an aspiring great power, India still frequently lacks the maturity on the world stage to behave like one. In the wake of the arrest, India announced a number of steps against U.S. diplomats, including revoking government-issued IDs for U.S. diplomats in India, stopping the U.S. Embassy from importing most goods, and most provocatively removing a concrete security barricade at the U.S. Embassy in Delhi. The sensitivity of such a threat to the embassy cannot be taken lightly, and the willingness of the Indian government to take such a step indicates a situation in which politics has run roughshod over any sensible understanding of diplomacy. Even if India feels its diplomat was ill-treated, a responsible power does not inflame the situation, especially against an ally that happens to be the world's most powerful country. There are many ways to show displeasure without putting the safety of American diplomats at risk. And there are more important moral and political issues that India has to address with the U.S. that do not involve, if the charges are true, vindicating the inalienable right of India's diplomats to illegally import and underpay domestic servants. Meanwhile, Khobragade and her father, a retired senior civil servant in the elite Indian Administrative Service (IAS) have gone on a PR offensive, with Mr. Khobragade charging, ""It is nothing but a racial bias. It is simple and clear racial bias to harass the Indians."" In light of such claims, which were frequently echoed in the Indian media, it bears mentioning that the U.S. attorney who brought the case, Preet Bharara, is himself a native of India, and he has strongly defended the action. In addition to the Indian government's extremely provocative steps, the treatment of the case by most of the Indian media has also shown a substantial moral blind spot: Few members of either the commentariat or the political class, neither of whom were short on outrage over Khobragade's treatment, seemed to evince much sympathy for the maid in question, who, if prosecutors are believed, has been the victim of a crime, not the perpetrator of one. Quite to the contrary, according to Indian media reports, the maid's family in India were threatened when she made her initial complaint and eventually were temporarily brought to the U.S. to assure their safety during the prosecution. The deafening silence in the maid's defense, in favor of a full-throated defense of an alleged criminal of the higher social class, tells a sad story about the reality of power and privilege in India that will be familiar to many foreigners who have spent substantial time in the country. Indian politicians play frequent lip service to the ""aam admi"" or common man, but the Indian press is daily filled with accounts of horrific mistreatment meted out by upper-class Indians against India's ""common citizens"" (for example, just last month a member of India's parliament was arrested for beating a servant to death -- allegedly over the quality of her dusting). In that context, it is worth noting that this is not the first recent case of alleged abuse of domestic servants at India's New York Consulate. In 2011, a member of the household staff sued India's consul general in New York, accusing him of forced labor. He denied the accusation; the case was subsequently settled but the terms of the settlement do not appear to be public. Less than a year later another Indian maid won a similar case against the consulate's former press and culture counselor. In that case, according to the Christian Science Monitor, ""the Indian diplomat has refused to pay the amount, a position supported by an Indian court."" The ultimate disposition of the Khobragade case is uncertain -- perhaps U.S. prosecutors will have been found to have made a catastrophic blunder. But no matter what the result in the court of law, the case shines a disturbing light on the politics of privilege in India -- and on the ability of the Indian government to conduct diplomacy befitting a great power, one that seeks to ease tensions with allies over disagreements rather than needlessly inflaming them.

"(CNN) -- Erick Munoz wants to see his wife's wish fulfilled this holiday season, but it's one that carries ethical and legal challenges: To be taken off of life support. Marlise Munoz, 33, is in serious condition in the intensive care unit at John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth, Texas, hospital officials said. She is unconscious and on a ventilator, her husband told CNN affiliate WFAA, but she wouldn't have wanted her life sustained by a machine. ""We talked about it. We're both paramedics,"" he told WFAA. ""We've seen things out in the field. We both knew that we both didn't want to be on life support."" Complicating an already difficult situation is that Munoz is also pregnant, about 18 weeks along, WFAA reported. Texas state law prohibits withdrawing or withholding life-sustaining treatment from a pregnant patient, regardless of her wishes. Patients can indicate their future wishes about medical treatment, in the event that they are unable to communicate them, through forms called advance directives. But in Texas, under the Health and Safety Code, such a form includes the provision ""I understand that under Texas law this Directive has no effect if I have been diagnosed as pregnant."" Erick Munoz told WFAA doctors said his wife may have suffered a pulmonary embolism, which happens when blood clots travel to the lungs from elsewhere in the body. They do not know how long the baby went without nutrients and oxygen. The hospital would not release specific details about Marlise Munoz's condition, but officials said the hospital would follow Texas law regarding care during pregnancy. Christmas Eve battle over girl on life support . ""We have a responsibility as a good corporate citizen here in Tarrant County to also provide the highest quality care we can for all of our patients,"" said J.R. Labbe, vice president of communications and community affairs for JPS Health Network, in a statement. ""But at all times, we will follow the law as it is applicable to health care in the state of Texas. And state law here says you cannot withhold or withdraw life sustaining treatment for a pregnant patient. It's that clear."" The husband and wife, both paramedics in the Tarrant County area, have a 14-month-old son named Mateo. Erick Munoz and Marlise Munoz's mother did not immediately respond to requests for comment from CNN. Erick Munoz found his wife unconscious on November 26, around 2 a.m. He performed CPR on her and then called 911, WFAA reported. Since that day, the pregnant woman has been on life support, her husband said. Tests have shown that the fetus has a normal heart beat, he said. At 24 weeks, doctors may know more about when the fetus can be taken out, Munoz's family told WFAA. Doctors have also discussed the possibility of taking the fetus to full term. He told WFAA that his wife had said she would not want to be kept alive by machine, and said he has reached ""the point where you wish that your wife's body would stop."" Munoz wears his wife's pink and blue bracelets on his wrist, WFAA reported. Her wedding ring is on his pinkie. When Munoz walks in the door, he said his son Mateo is waiting for his mother to show up. ""You can see it in his eyes,"" Munoz said.","Marlise Munoz fell unconscious on November 26 .

"(CNN) -- Tourist traps -- overcrowded, over-hyped and, of course, overpriced. Yet we keep going. By the millions. Why? Because however one bad experience may make us feel about them, they're awesome. That's why they get overcrowded in the first place. That's why, as Yogi Berra supposedly once said of popular St. Louis restaurant Ruggeri's: ""Nobody goes there anymore. It's too crowded."" Professional globetrotter Gary Arndt perhaps sums it up best when he says, ""I had a horrible time at the Pyramids, but I'd go back and recommend people go because ... they're the Pyramids. Some places you just have to suck it up and go visit."" Here are eight over-popular places that are well worth a visit anyway -- and a few tips for avoiding the scrum, if you really have to. Share your picks for most-worth-it tourist traps in the comments. 1. Taj Mahal (Agra, India) It's one of India's most popular sights, attracting 3 million visitors a year -- which automatically puts it on many tourist's verboten list. More fool them: they're missing a World Heritage Site that really lives up to the hype. At sunrise or sunset the crowds are slimmest and the building is at its most photogenic. Travel writer Jodi Ettenberg picked the dawn hours of a rainy day for her visit, when most tourists would stay in bed. National Geographic Traveler of the Year Shannon O'Donnell took a different approach. ""I went on a sunny day and still had a wonderful visit,"" says O'Donnell. ""The site is just as popular with Indian tourists, so it was fun to interact with the families."" 2. The Acropolis (Athens, Greece) Ruggedly modern Athens may be a culture shock to those expecting white marble and togas at every turn, but for many the most jarring experience awaits at the ticket barriers to the Acropolis, complete with security guards and a sea of visitors. The climb up is hot and crowded -- but at the top, you'll see why a million people do this every year. This is Athenian culture refined and placed on a pedestal 150 meters high -- in every sense, it's the heart of Athens and maybe even of Greece. The country's monuments have endured thousands of years of warfare, stone theft, punishing heat and, in one dramatic incident, an exploding ammo dump -- but they're still here. Be inspired by that, grit your teeth and brave those crowds. It's worth it. Alternately ... If you're looking for the best view in the city, head northeast and climb Lykavitos Hill. From its peak (at 277 meters, the highest point in the city), you'll be looking down onto the Acropolis, and the rest of the view will punch the breath out of you. 3. London Underground (UK) Canned sardines would gloat if they ever saw the twisted, conjoined bodies scrapping for pockets of air during rush hour on London's Tube service. During tourist season, it can get spectacularly horrible. There are tricks and shortcuts to avoid bottlenecks, including going up to street level and walking to the next station. Alternative Tube maps have become an art form (like the incredible Wonderground map) and the network's history is fascinating. If you need an excuse to explore, there's the Tube Challenge -- visiting all 270 stations in 24 hours. 4. Khao San Road (Bangkok) Online reviews of Khao San can be damning: ""Meh, lots of drunk backpackers, tacky, noisy and crowded."" Dubbed by Susan Orlean as The Place To Disappear, it's usually raucous and requires a particular mindset to enjoy. It's a tourist trap -- but not an unwelcome one, according to the average review on TripAdvisor. People visit Khao San because it's thrillingly chaotic -- the noise and the crowds are the price of that excitement. They're usually a bargain. Alternately... Too much chaos for you? Look to the surrounding streets. While food on Khao San itself has a reputation for being underwhelming and overpriced, writer Mark Piano found a wealth of Lebanese and Israeli food nearby, including the well-reviewed Shoshana, the ""cheapest and best hummus I've found in town."" 5. Sacre Coeur (Paris) Acting as Paris's own Acropolis is the Basilica of the Sacred Heart of Paris, better known as Sacre Coeur, high above the city on the hill of Montmartre. Consecrated less than a century ago, it's the city's must-see symbol of unity and renewed confidence -- and yet the approach to it is plagued with Paris's worst tourist scams, including the Paris String Trick. Disheartening? Of course. Avoidable? Absolutely. ""Most visitors take the same route,"" says travel blogger James Feess. ""They get off at the Anvers metro stop, walk through the gauntlet of tacky souvenir shops on Rue de Steinkerque, take the funicular up to Sacre Coeur, walk to the Place du Tertre to see the artists selling their original paintings and finally walk back down the hill to see the underwhelming Moulin Rouge. ""Venture outside these few areas and you'll find a whole different world of quintessential Parisian cafes, tree-lined streets, private gardens, hidden alleyways and boulangeries that most tourists never see. "" 6. Stonehenge (UK) Ah, Stonehenge. These days you're unlikely to step between the stones unless you're allowed special access (say, you're Doctor Who). Most visitors have to walk around the outside -- and yet that's enough. It's the crowning monument in a staggeringly archaeology-rich landscape. It's also changing dramatically. A new Â£27 million ($45 million) visitor center opened in December 2013, and as with many new arrivals it's suffered a few teething problems. This is the most famous prehistoric monument in England, perhaps in the world -- and we still don't know what it was for. Alternately ... Twenty miles to the north, Avebury's stone circles has no admission fee and gets a quarter of the annual visitors. The stone circles are a short walk from West Kennet Avenue and other stunning prehistoric monuments. 7. Christ The Redeemer (Rio de Janeiro) It's the most famous sight in Brazil, it's stunningly beautiful and it has a remarkable history. Of course you need to go. Even if the area around the 98-foot-tall statue is almost always heaving with visitors. ""Most of the photos you'll have seen are likely to have been taken by photographers in helicopters who can find the space they need for the shot without the crowds,"" says travel photographer Laurence Norah. ""If you want to avoid the crush, go on a weekday rather than the weekend and perhaps pick a day that isn't totally clear. ""The morning is better for photos of the statue, as the light is on him, whilst the afternoon and evening offers better light across Rio."" 8. Grand Canyon (Arizona) If North America's Natural Wonder Of The World is your destination this year, don't waste your visit on a whistle-stop trip to the edge. That's how most people experience it, and it's a poor way to do this 17-million-year-old landmark justice. To avoid the beaten track do as the wisest local guides suggest -- book a few days and venture below the rim -- best to go out of season, as the canyon floor can be unbearably hot (39C/102F) during summer.","Rio's most famous landmark, Christ the Redeemer, is usually heaving with visitors. So what?
It's worth booking a couple days at the Grand Canyon rather than peering over the edge and leaving .
Choosing a weekday over weekend or early morning over midday can spare you crowds at big attractions ."
"Manila, Philippines (CNN) -- Philippine police have identified the U.S. Marine suspected of killing a transgender woman in a hotel. Private First Class Scott Pemberton will soon be formally charged with murder, Philippine National Police Senior Superintendent Wilben Mayor said Tuesday. The Marine was being held on a warship after the death of the transgender woman in an Olangapo hotel room. Police identified the deceased as 26-year-old Jeffrey Laude, also known as Jennifer. Her naked body, which showed signs of strangulation, was found with her head in the toilet shortly after midnight Sunday, according to a police report of the incident. A witness at the hotel reported seeing Laude with an ""unidentified white male foreigner"" with a ""marine style hair cut"" entering the room together. Another witness told police the two had been seen together at a nearby disco club. Because no charges have yet been filed, U.S. officials have not identified the Marine, who is assigned to 2nd Battalion, 9th Marines out of Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. ""The Marine Corps is working closely and cooperating fully with the Philippine National Police to ensure a thorough investigation is completed and due process of law is followed,"" Col. Brad Bartelt, spokesman with the U.S. Marine Corps Forces, Pacific, said in a statement. Three other Marines from the same unit have been identified as potential witnesses, the Marine Corps Times newspaper reported, citing an internal Navy memo on the incident. They are being held.

"(CNN) -- It's a good summer for piers. Ryde Pier in the UK just celebrated its 200th birthday, and New York's historic Pier A will reopen any time now (we're told), after decades of neglect and a multi-million dollar revamp. The structure, first opened in 1886 and now listed on the National Register of Historic Places, closed to the public in 1960 but will soon host a visitor center, an oyster bar and a fine dining restaurant. If you can't get to these icons of jetty-hood though, there are plenty of other spectacular piers to travel for. Umhlanga Pier (Durban, South Africa) This pier isn't just a place to grab a great photo -- it's an extension of an underground culvert that helps disperse excess storm water from the land into the ocean. The distinctive whale bone structure won the South African National Award for Outstanding Civil Engineering Achievement. Length: 80 meters. Opened: 2007. Contains: Storm water disposal channels. Cost: Free. Rotonda a Mare (Senigallia, Italy) Rotonda a Mare (""circular pier"") had additional purposes during wartime, serving as a military warehouse during World War II. The pier was built in 1923 but closed in 2005 for renovations. It reopened a year later, with a beautiful sea-themed mosaic by Enzo Cucchi adorning the entrance. Opened: 1923. Contains: A concert hall. Cost: Free. Clevedon Pier (Somerset, UK) Late English poet Sir John Betjeman described this pier as ""the most beautiful pier in England."" It was built in 1869 as a departure point for paddle steamer excursions, and is the only fully intact, Grade 1 listed pier in the UK. The supports were constructed using metal taken from Isambard Kingdom Brunel's South Wales railway. Length: 312 meters. Opened: 1869. Contains: Art gallery and gift shop. Cost: $1.60 for children, $3 for adults. Kastrup Pier (Kastrup, Denmark) This unusual pier contains a structure that encircles an outdoor swimming area, allowing visitors to take a dip without the risk of being washed out to sea. The pier is made from azobe wood, which is resistant to sea water and at night up-lighting emphasizes the beautiful curved wooden walls and illuminates the swimming area -- and the skinny dippers who reportedly frequent it. Length: 100 meters. Opened: 2004. Contains: A swimming area and diving platform. Cost: Free. Huntington Beach Pier (California) With a length of 560 meters, this beautiful Californian pier is one of the longest on the U.S. west coast. During World War II it doubled as a submarine lookout post, with machine guns positioned at the end. If you don't live nearby, you can check out the view from the pier at any Hollister store -- footage recorded by cameras at the end are shown on screens inside. Length: 560 meters. Opened: 1914. Contains: A diner and shops. Cost: Free. Los Muertos Pier (Puerto Vallarta, Mexico) This 328-meter-long pier was designed by architect José de Jesús Torres Vega and opened in 2013 as part of a scheme to regenerate Puerto Vallarta. Construction costs totaled $2.4 million. The pier is especially popular with couples; historically, Los Muertos is one of Puerto Vallarta's most romantic areas, despite the name's distinctly unromantic translation: Los Muertos means ""the dead."" Length: 328 meters. Opened: 2013. Contains: A landing dock and sculpture. Cost: Free. Scheveningen Pier (Scheveningen, Holland) Scheveningen pier stands out because of its unusual construction, which comprises four island-type sections and upper and lower areas. The structure, the longest pier in the Netherlands, was built in 1959 and purchased by hotel firm Van der Valk Hotels for the symbolic price of one guilder ($0.50) in 2001. Length: 382 meters. Opened: 1959. Contains: Restaurant, casino and a children's funhouse. Cost: Free. Brighton Pier (Brighton, UK) Brighton's only remaining pier (the rest have burned down) has had starring roles in ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,"" the 1970s British TV series ""The Persuaders"" and Ralph Fiennes' drama ""The End of the Affair."" An unusual fact? If Usain Bolt maintained his 200 meter sprint record for its entire length, it would take him 50.36 seconds to reach the end. Length: 524 meters. Opened: 1899. Contains: A theme park, shopping arcades and amusement arcades. Visitors per year: 4 million. Cost: Free. Busselton Jetty (Busselton, Australia) This is the longest pier in the Southern Hemisphere. A railway runs along its length and it's the only pier with an underwater observatory at the end. Prior to the Commonwealth Games in 2006, the Queen's baton -- the Commonwealth equivalent of the Olympic torch -- was taken to the observatory and carried underwater by a diver. Length: 1,841 meters. Opened: 1865. Contains: An observatory. Cost: Free.

"(CNN) -- Werewolves are usually the stuff of B-movies and bad novels, but last year British author Glen Duncan did the unthinkable in literary circles, crafting a howling good tale out of the weary werewolf myth. The result was the best-selling thriller ""The Last Werewolf."" Critics and readers happily devoured the darkly comic novel. In the book, Jake Marlowe, a 200-year-old lonely lycanthrope, believes himself to be the last of his kind until he meets Talulla Demetriou. It's your classic tale of boy meets girl, except this pair turn into werewolves, battle vampires and fall in love. While their relationship came to a tragic and bloody end, Demetriou returns in Duncan's eagerly awaited sequel, ""Talulla Rising."" Hitting bookshelves this week, the supernatural story picks up soon after where ""The Last Werewolf"" left off. Talulla is grieving the loss of her werewolf lover; she's on the run and about to give birth to Jake's child, under a full moon no less. To give away any more would spoil the surprise for fans, but suffice to say Talulla turns into a monstrously protective mother. Adventurous readers who are looking for a break from the usual beach read should consider this alternately horrifying and humorous, imaginative and energetic novel. CNN recently spoke to Duncan by telephone from his London home about the new book. The following is an edited transcript: . CNN: What was the spark that led you to write ""The Last Werewolf"" and ""Talulla Rising""? Duncan: A combination of mercenary pragmatism and drunken inspiration. After seven novels which, though well-received, hadn't made paying the bills any easier, I decided to write something my agent could sell as a book with commercial potential. Cut to New Year's Eve 2009. A party, friends, everyone drunk. We've had the forced-down champagne and abused fireworks on the roof terrace, and are now taking stock of what we've done in the last year -- and what we plan to do in the new one. Pretty much ex nihilo I said: ""I'm going to write a novel about the last surviving werewolf."" The idea met with feeble unanimous approval. So I woke up the next morning and started work. CNN: Talulla is such a compelling character, was there a big difference between writing her voice and Jake? Duncan: Yes. Jake is just me. Or, rather, me in his predicament: not very difficult to write. With Talulla I didn't have the crutch (ahem) of my own gender and personality to lean on. There's no way of knowing if the imaginative projection is a success except in so far as readers find Talulla a convincing female. Let's see. CNN: How did you develop the werewolf mythology behind your story? Were there traditional elements you wanted to keep, change or explore further? Duncan: I just kept the parts of the traditional mythology I liked, or that served my thematic purpose, and ditched whatever I didn't. Death by silver, I liked, so it was in. Ditto visceral antipathy to vampires. Some versions of the myth allow for the lycanthrope's voluntary metamorphosis -- but that's not as rich a moral quandary as being forced to change, whether you like it or not, every full moon. Watch Glen Duncan read an excerpt from ""Talulla Rising"" CNN: Do you have a favorite werewolf story and why do you think they have appealed to readers for so long? Duncan: I've never read a werewolf story in my life, but my favorite werewolf movie is, of course, ""An American Werewolf in London."" (Closely followed by the brilliantly mad ""Dog Soldiers."") Myths of metamorphosis are as old as the human ability to tell stories, and survive because they express something fundamental to the psyche. In the case of werewolves, the fear of the beast within, and the desire to be liberated into it. CNN: You've unleashed your writer's id in these novels. There's lots of sex and violence, definitely not for the faint of heart. Was it fun to write? Duncan: For me writing a novel isn't fun, no matter how much sex and violence it contains. It's satisfying, yes, to get something right at the level of the sentence, and it's fun to have finished writing the thing. ... But the actual writing? No. It's agony, every day, an endless search for reasons to not start writing. I wish it were otherwise, but there you are. CNN: What would you like readers to take away from ""Talulla Rising""? Duncan: The feeling of having just read the best werewolf novel (along with its predecessor) the world has yet produced -- what else? Or, more reasonably: It's not so different for girls after all. CNN: Is there anything you've read recently that inspired you? Duncan: I'm not reading much contemporary work at the moment (not until the third werewolf book's done, in fact), but I'm a couple of hundred pages into ""Don Quixote"" -- which is absolutely hilarious. That'll last me through summer. Especially if it's an English summer. CNN: Without giving too much away, it feels like you've set things up quite nicely for a trilogy. Any hints you can give us about your next novel? Duncan: Impossible without spoilers. But multiple narrators -- including a vampire -- and a myth of origin for werewolves. Sex, violence, jokes, philosophy, love, death. Business as usual. Read an excerpt from ""Talulla Rising""","Glen Duncan releases his second werewolf novel this week: ""Talulla Rising""
Duncan got the inspiration for the series during a drunken New Year's celebration .
The novelist predicts his next book will feature: ""Sex, violence, jokes, philosophy, love, death."""
"Las Vegas (CNN) -- Like most people who visit Las Vegas, Hillary Clinton had an interesting few hours during her time on Monday. She met a legendary boxing promoter at a fundraiser that was held down the hall from a wedding. And she crossed paths with an uber-GOP moneyman at a dinner with 900 of Nevada's biggest philanthropists and donors, where Clinton was presented with a pair of ""running"" shoes. All in an odd days work for Clinton as she tours the nation for a combination of paid and political speaking engagements. Clinton ended her night keynoting a fundraiser for the University of Nevada-Las Vegas Foundation, where the former secretary of state collected a $225,000 paycheck for a speech that touted the need for more access to higher education. Clinton: 'Is that a marijuana plant?' ""More needs to be done,"" Clinton said of making higher education available. ""Higher education shouldn't be a privilege for those able to afford it. It should be an opportunity widely available for anyone with the talent and determination and ambition to learn."" While the event was trumpeted as a night with Hillary Clinton, the gala was also a forum to honor Sheldon Adelson, the controversial casino magnate who operates numerous casinos in Nevada and overseas. Adelson, who was honored on Monday for his $7 million commitment to UNLV's hotel college, dished out millions of dollars to Republican presidential hopefuls in 2012 and is expected to do the same in 2016. Adelson and Clinton met backstage before the former first lady's speech and, according to Clinton, joked about their differences. ""Sheldon said to me 'Gee, I wish they paired me with you to ask the questions, we could have a really (good) debate,"" Clinton said to laughs from the audience. Clinton wasn't exactly effusive in honoring Adelson's donation to UNLV at the top of her speech, though. While she heralded others work for UNLV, she said the casino magnate's ""work in this community... was also honored"" tonight. Clinton's message, like during most speeches, struck a bipartisan tone. ""I think it is time we get back to working together again,"" Clinton said. ""And that we do it in spirit of openness and understanding that we may have different views... but we are Americans and most importantly we have to be on the American team."" Clinton was also interviewed on stage Monday by Brian Greenspun, the publisher of the Las Vegas Sun and Bill Clinton's college roommate. Greenspun, who referred to Clinton as a ""friend"" on stage, kicked off their conversation by presenting Clinton with a pair of running shoes. The newspaper publisher was clear to point out that his wife bought the shoes ""in the section that said running shoes,"" a reference to Clinton's likely run for the presidency in 2016. Clinton's appearance at UNLV was controversial when it was announced over the summer because the university foundation was paying Clinton at the same time that tuition was being raised for students. On Monday, event organizers argued that the fee was worth it because the event would raise more money than the foundation would spend. Clinton started the day in Colorado, where she headlined a closed fundraiser for Sen. Mark Udall, who is running for re-election. The pair also visited a local coffee shop and joked about the designs at the top of their lattes. ""Look at you, you got like a plant,"" Clinton said to Udall. ""Is that a marijuana plant?"" Clinton joked, referring to Colorado's recent decision to legalize marijuana. Her first event in Las Vegas was headlining a fundraiser for the Reid Nevada Fund, a joint fundraising agreement between the Nevada Democratic Party and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's reelection campaign. The event was well attended by a who's who of Nevada Democrats and big-money donors in the Silver State. Representatives Dina Titus and Steven Horsford attended the $10,000-a-person VIP event. Roberta Lange, chairwoman of the Nevada State Democratic Party, also attended, as did Peter Palivos, a controversial philanthropist and Reid donor. But by far the most colorful attendee was Don King, the legendary boxing promoter. ""I have been a supporter of Secretary Clinton for a long time,"" King said as he walked into the event. ""She is a dynamic woman, and I am a fighter for woman's rights."" King sported a jean jacket decorated with stars and stripes. He carried with him both an American and Israeli flag and was trailed by both a still photographer and a videographer -- paid for by him -- who said they were making a documentary about his political life. As for whether he supports Clinton running for president in 2016, King would not say, though he did say she ""would be a fighter from the womb to the tomb."" As attendees left the Reid fundraiser and headed to the UNLV event, the sharply dressed couples passed a small ""wedding in progress"" at the Aria Hotel and Casino chapel. Only in Vegas.","Hillary Clinton met GOP uber-donor Sheldon Adelson backstage at event .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Celebrities who have been caught using drugs or frequenting prostitutes have been banned from China's airwaves, according to state media, as a national crackdown on vice widens. The order was issued to media outlets by the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television, China's media watchdog, according to the state-run China Daily. It said that entertainers who broke the law would not be invited to appear on shows, and that their previous work should not be aired. The ruling applies to TV and radio shows, films and advertising across multiple platforms. The ban would help ""spread positive energy"" and ""create a positive environment"" on media platforms, the watchdog said in its statement. The announcement comes as China's government pushes ahead with a war on drugs, gambling and prostitution. In February, police raided 2,000 establishments and detained more than 900 people in Dongguan, a southern Chinese city that had gained a reputation as ""sin city"" for its thriving sex industry. And last month the Ministry of Public Security announced a new round of crackdowns on the production and sale of drugs in 108 cities, China Daily reported. Celebrity busts . A number of celebrities have been caught up in the raids. In August, 32-year-old actor Jaycee Chan, the son of screen legend Jackie Chan, was arrested alongside 23-year-old Taiwanese actor Kai Ko in Beijing on drugs charges. Both tested positive for marijuana. Singer Li Daimo was sentenced to nine months in jail for hosting a crystal meth party at his home, according to the China Daily, while screenwriter and novelist Chen Wanning, known as Ning Caishen, was detained for possessing and using methamphetamine. In August, management agencies representing entertainers in Beijing signed an agreement with authorities banning drug use from the industry, and pledging to drop stars who broke the law. News of the ban spread quickly on Chinese social media. On one unofficial poll on the Twitter-like Sina Weibo service, 84% of respondents supported the ban, while 16% were opposed. ""Artists have a broad influence. (Their behavior) will have a bad influence on juveniles, especially their fans. So I think this is great,"" wrote Weibo user @Xiaomanzu. Others disagreed. ""Whether (they) can return to showbiz should depend on the market... Enforcing the ban is totally acting like a dictator,"" wrote @Miamia_wodexingxingkai.","Celebrities who use drugs or prostitutes are banned, says China's media watchdog .

"(CNN) -- MotoGP world champion Jorge Lorenzo overcame a collision with a seagull to set a lap record in qualifying for Sunday's Australian Grand Prix, but will face a new challenge in the race itself. Due to concerns over safety on the new surface at Victoria's Phillip Island circuit, officials have decided to cut the event to 26 laps and require a mandatory change of bikes for the first time in the history of motorcycling's elite division. The MotoGP website reported after Saturday's qualifying, which Lorenzo topped ahead of rookie championship leader Marc Marquez, that tire supplier Bridgestone could not guarantee the safety of its rear slicks beyond 14 laps. ""Every rider will be required to enter the pits and change to their second machine with fresh tires at least once during the race,"" the statement said. ""No rider is permitted to make more than 14 laps on any one slick rear tire."" Lorenzo, who trails Marquez by 43 points, needs to finish at least second to take the title race into the final two events of this season in Japan and their native Spain. The two-time MotoGP champion will head his 20-year-old Honda rival and Yamaha teammate Valentino Rossi on the front row of the grid, having beaten Casey Stoner's 2008 lap record on Saturday. He had set an early leading time despite having a seagull stuck in his front fork after colliding with the bird, but needed to come back after pitting to reclaim pole position from Marquez with a sizzling lap of one minute 27.899 seconds. ""I had an impact with a bird on the first few laps on the bike, luckily we could take it off and I could make a second attempt without a passenger -- maybe because of this I went a little bit faster and was able to make pole position,"" said the Mallorcan, who sealed last year's title at Phillip Island but has only won at the circuit in 250cc racing. ""I'm very happy because I pushed to the limit to make the lap and I made a very good time. We have some problems with the tire because the new asphalt makes a lot of graining. If we can make a good start we will try to get away at the beginning."" Marquez is seeking to become the first rookie to win the title since American Kenny Roberts in 1978. ""The goal today was to get a front-row start, and we achieved it,"" he said after clocking 1:28.120 and confirming his status as the best overall qualifier this season.

"Billings, Montana (CNN) -- His lenient sentence and the judge's comments about his victim sparked national outrage and protests. On Thursday, Stacey Rambold, an admitted rapist, will be released from incarceration after just 31 days. The former high school teacher is set to walk out of the Montana State Prison in Deer Lodge at 9 a.m. (11 a.m. ET). He won't be a free man exactly; he's on probation for the next 14 years, 11 months. The victim's mother is hopeful that will change. ""(Judge G. Todd Baugh) made a mistake and I'm disappointed, (31) days, that's outrageous, but the Montana Supreme Court stepped in. Hopefully they'll make it right,"" said Auliea Hanlon, whose daughter, Cherice Moralez, committed suicide before Rambold went to trial. Prosecutors have appealed the sentence -- saying it is illegal -- to the high court. Before suicide, raped Montana teen loved outdoors, poetry . Activists file formal judicial complaint . On Tuesday, the Montana and Pennsylvania chapters of the National Organization for Women and an activist group called Ultraviolet filed a complaint with a judicial review board, CNN affiliate KULR reported. More than 140,000 people signed accompanying petitions, the groups said. ""If we can't get him removed from this, there is something wrong with the system, and I know people in the state will work to not get (Baugh) re-elected (next year),"" said Marian Bradley, president of Montana NOW. The case drew widespread attention when Baugh imposed a one-month sentence on Rambold and made controversial comments about the victim, saying she ""seemed older than her chronological age"" and she was ""as much in control of the situation."" Rambold admitted raping the girl in 2008 while she was 14 and he was her teacher at her high school. Moralez took her life shortly before her 17th birthday. The judge later apologized for his comments, and earlier this month tried to revisit his sentence. But the state Supreme Court barred him from a new ruling, saying he didn't have the legal standing to change a sentence. Baugh said he didn't realize at first that the minimum sentence should have been two years. Baugh's secretary said Wednesday the judge had no comment on Rambold's release. Hanlon told CNN's Anderson Cooper that she wants to avoid Rambold. ""I never saw him until we were in a courtroom all those years,"" she said. ""I hope I never see him (again)."" Defense attorney Jay Lansing had no comment on the case, but has said his client contends the sentence imposed is lawful and appropriate. The legal process . With Cherice's death, the prosecution entered into what is known as a ""deferred prosecution agreement"" with Rambold. This meant that all charges against Rambold -- who admitted to one of the rape charges -- would be dismissed if he completed a sex-offender treatment program and met other requirements. One of them was to have no contact with children. But the ex-teacher fell short of the agreement and prosecutors asked Baugh last month to sentence him to 20 years. Baugh ruled Rambold's infractions weren't serious enough. ""He made some violations of his treatment program,"" the judge said. ""They were more technical and not the kind you would send someone to prison for."" Hanlon said the pain of her daughter's death hasn't faded. ""I think we just get used to it, so we don't cry every day,"" she said, but the tears still came. Opinion: In Montana, a case study in rape culture .

"(CNN) -- A Florida man charged with murder in the fatal shooting of a teenager amid an argument over loud music at a gas station pleaded not guilty Monday. Michael Dunn, 45, entered his plea during a hearing Monday morning at the Duval County, Florida, jail. Dunn told investigators he fired at a car in which Jordan Davis, 17, and three of his friends were sitting because he felt threatened by them. No guns were found inside the teens' car, the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office said. The case against Dunn, who has been jailed without bond since the November 26 shooting at the Jacksonville, Florida, gas station, has been compared to the ""stand your ground"" case in which George Zimmerman is charged with killing Trayvon Martin. Similar to Martin, Davis was an African-American teen. Dunn, indicted on a first-degree murder charge last Thursday, is no ""vigilante"" but did feel threatened and shot out of ""self-defense,"" his lawyer said two days after his arrest. ""There are no comparisons to the Trayvon Martin situation,"" said Robin Lemonidis, Dunn's attorney. ""He is devastated and horrified by the death of the teen."" Dunn told authorities that he had asked the teens to turn down the blaring music coming from their vehicle, which was parked next to his as he waited for his girlfriend to return to the car. He heard threats from the teens, Dunn told police, and he felt threatened and thought he saw a gun in their car. He grabbed his gun and fired at least eight shots, authorities said. ""It's about loud music and it's also about anger, about having a concealed weapon in your car, knowing you have it and feel bold enough to use it because you're being shielded in the state of Florida,"" Jordan Davis' father, Ron Davis, told CNN. ""They tell you if you have a concealed weapon, these are some of the things you can do. If you feel you're threatened in any way, then you are allowed to use your weapon.""

"(CNN) -- When all you've got is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. In business, that hammer is money and the nail is employee productivity. Employees at most companies are offered higher salaries or year-end bonuses in exchange for better output. Businesses better get some new tools quickly, because this hammer is not enough to get the job done. Countless employees are unhappy, reporting that they only work for the money and yet would trade a raise for a better boss and work environment. This is not a recipe for long term success. Anyone who wants to motivate employees needs to understand what motivates people in general. People certainly want more money so they can afford more of life's indulgences and have some protection against life's inevitable hazards. But that is only part of the story. In my new book, ""Social: Why our brains are wired to connect,"" I suggest that our brains are wired with another set of motivations, social motivations, that are just as fundamental as those that guide us towards physical pleasures and away from physical pains. When we are socially rejected or threatened, we feel a kind of social pain, which activates the same brain regions that register the distress of physical pain. Taking Tylenol even reduces the brain's response to social pain. On the flip side, fair treatment, praise from others, and even the opportunity to help someone in need are all socially rewarding and activate the brain's most primitive pleasure centers. Because infants depend on these social motivations in order to receive the care they need to survive, these urges are built into our operating system and stay with us for a lifetime. This has serious consequences for the workplace. If companies do not create socially rewarding environments, it is sure to affect the bottom line. One study found that individuals who were made to feel rejected scored 15% lower on an IQ test. We can understand why someone who just broke their leg would score lower -- how could they possibly focus when experiencing intense pain? Yet, the same is true of social injuries because all pain grabs our attention leaving less attention for other important things. In contrast, praising employees may have many of the same motivational consequences as giving a raise, but at little cost to the company. One study has found that employees were willing to give up almost $30,000 in yearly salary to be recognized for high praise at work. Another study found that when employees were able to see firsthand how their work was helping others, their productivity more than doubled. Being reminded of how their work was advancing their own careers had no effect. Of course, we don't just blindly seek out social connection. We have powerful mind reading abilities that help us pursue these connections more successfully. We understand the meaning of a sly smile or a furrowed brow and sarcastic humor is not lost on most of us. We are masters of moving from others' visible signs to the invisible thoughts, feelings, and goals motivating other people. This mind reading ability allows us to work well in teams together by predicting the needs of others around us and acting accordingly. Even though thinking about the physical world and thinking about the mental worlds of other people don't really feel like profoundly different kinds of thinking, recent brain imaging has shown that there are separate brain systems for these two kinds of thinking. In fact, the brain regions supporting social and analytical thinking mostly function like a neural seesaw such that when one increases in activity, the other decreases. This presents a problem in the workplace because we place such a premium on analytical thinking; we typically promote analytical problem solving at the expense of social problem solving, even though both are critically important. Creating strong social networks in a company affect the bottom line just as much as the analytical abilities and training of the people within those networks. Nowhere is the importance of social thinking more evident than in our leaders. A large recent survey found that leaders who are rated highly on being analytic and results focused are unlikely to be seen as great leaders, but if those same leaders also possess strong social skills, their chance of being seen as a great leader skyrockets. It is then deeply troubling to find that only the tiniest fraction of leaders are seen as possessing both kinds of skills. Money matters in the workplace -- there is no denying it. But money isn't the only thing that matters. Our brains are built for connecting and as more companies begin to recognize this, the positive changes they bring to the workplace will help employees to work smarter, happier, and more productively. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dr Matthew Lieberman.","Human brain is rewarded for connections with others, writes Dr Matthew Lieberman .
Social pain is just as valid as physical pain, according to Lieberman's new book .

"(CNN) -- It's a problem which is there in black and white. There are 92 professional clubs in the English Football League -- but just two of those are led by black managers and according to the latest English Football Association report, while there are only 15 black or ethnic minority coaches working across the professional game. It is a damning statistic which shames English football and the FA's chairman Greg Dyke says that must change with the FA currently discussing the merits of the Rooney rule which is used in the NFL as a way of bringing more black or ethnic minorities into the sport. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho recently said ""there is no racism in football"" but Dyke, who took over from David Bernstein in July 2013, is concerned about minority representation saying English football must implement its own Rooney rule. ""It has to happen,"" Greg Dyke, chairman of the FA told CNN, referring to the rule, which was introduced in the U.S. states to ensure teams should interview at least one black of ethnic minority candidate. In the U.S. the number of black assistant coaches working in NFL rose from 14 in 1980 to 199 out of 610 in 2012 -- a rise of 32.6%. Some 25 years ago, there was only one black head coach, Art Shell, who managed the Oakland Raiders, while now there are currently four with Lovie Smith, Mike Tomlin, Jim Caldwell and Marvin Lewis all leading the way. But English football has not progressed with one former player, Sol Campbell, complaining that he would have to move abroad to pursue coaching opportunities because of the ""archaic"" attitudes towards black coaches. ""You go anywhere in the country to watch football now and there's a disproportionate amount of ethnic minorities and yet why are they not coming through the game?"" pondered Dyke. ""We've got an inclusion group looking at whether the Rooney Rule would work. We apply the Rooney Rule when we're applying for coaches. You need to know it's going to work."" Rio Ferdinand, the former Manchester United and England defender, has advocated such a system and Dyke, has not discounted it. ""There's no point saying if you're going to interview five people with one from an ethnic minority if they're never going to get the job,"" he added. ""That's damaging. You need to know it's going to work which is why you have to get more coaches through."" The lack of leading Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) coaches working in English football is just one problem facing Dyke and his commission. Lagging behind European rivals . By the sound of it English football is effectively broken. According to the latest report, there are only 205 English coaches with a UEFA pro-licence, the top qualification, compared to 2,353 in Spain and 1,304 in Germany. Even lower down the ranking, Italy boasts 37,742 coaches with a 'B' licence compared to just 9,548 in England -- the lowest out of the five top leagues in Europe. While the FA says there are 50,000 coaches active in England, 39,000 of those do not possess qualifications above the Youth Award 3 -- the level below the 'B' licence. ""We're miles behind, miles behind,"" said Dyke when commenting on coaching. ""We're miles behind on coaching and facilities. Can we catch up? Yes, but it will take five or 10 years."" The latest proposals would involve the FA set up a coach education organization which will be led by a new head of education who will sit on the governing body's executive. The FA plans to build 'football hubs' in 30 different cities across England including London, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield with £230 million being invested in the project over the next five years, though bear in mind the Dutch FA is plowing €1 billion ($1.3 billion) into their domestic game every year. The hubs will boast state of the art facilities including 3G artificial pitches which are widely used across Europe with Germany boasting 3,735 such surfaces compared to just 639 in England. England has one synthetic pitch for every 42,000 people according to the FA report, while the Netherlands has one for every 13,000 -- a significant advantage for the development of young players. Each hub will also have floodlights, changing rooms, a classroom and changing facilities all of which will be cared for by a local body. There are also plans in place to increase those holding the very top coaching qualification to 300, while taking the number of Youth Award Level 3 coaches from 800 to 3,000. ""One of the criteria when we are setting up these coaching courses is that we want to get more people through it so we get more coaches,"" said Dyke. ""It's their job to analyze the constraints why people aren't coming. Is it that there isn't enough supply? Is it cost? Time? ""If you're an ex-Premier League footballer then cost doesn't matter. Therefore do you approach it by reducing the cost or by putting aside a fund for those who can't afford it?"" Leagues apart . While the FA counts every penny in its budget, the Premier League posted revenues of over £3 billion ($4.8 billion) last June, according to financial analysts Deloitte. The Premier League has already secured a domestic television deal worth over £3 billion which lasts until the end of the 2016 season, while foreign broadcasters have paid £2.3 billion for the same period. But have those riches damaged the English game with young domestic talent often not being the opportunity to shine with big money being spent on overseas stars? According to the latest figures from the FA, Premier League starts made by English players were recorded at just 32%, while the figure for those at the top six clubs have decreased from 28% to 25%. That figure was at 69% two decades ago. During the last transfer window, which ended on August 31, Premier League club spent a record £835 million on players. The drought of young English talent has had a knock on effect with the national team suffering with the country not having reached the semifinals of a major tournament since 1996. Speaking at the Leaders Conference in London earlier this week, Christian Seifert, the chief executive of the German Bundesliga, said the sheer amount of money within the Premier League was having a negative effect on player development. He said: ""If you have so much money compared to us ... and you can afford nearly every player around the world, how motivated are you to put the cards on young players who need one or two years?"" Seifert claims that the success of the German national team, which came following a through review of the country's failings during the dire 2000 European Championship campaign, benefited from the relationship with the nation's FA and the Bundesliga. Dyke concedes that the FA cannot help transform the fortunes of English football alone -- he knows that without the cooperation of the Premier League, England could remain in the international wilderness without a supply line of fresh, young talent. ""The trouble is that because we're the richest league in the world, they've got enough money not to worry about bringing kids through,"" said Dyke. ""The average Premier League manager reign lasts a year. So, he's not going to do think about the five-year development, he's going to think about how to save his job. ""He can save his job by going to Belgium and buying a 22-year-old who has already played 200 games at a decent level. ""No we can't do it without the Premier League, but the Premier League and the clubs recognize the issue. ""At some stage, some of the owners of the clubs are going to say, 'I'm spending six or seven million on an academy and getting nothing out of it. ""It needs money and they've got money. I think they'll contribute as long as other people contribute."" Read more: FIFA's sexism own goal?

"(CNN) -- UK lawmakers have voted in the House of Commons to recognize Palestine as a state ""as a contribution to securing a negotiated two state solution."" The motion was backed overwhelmingly Monday by 274 votes to 12. However, fewer than half of the 650 MPs in the House of Commons took part in the debate. The motion passed was, ""That this House believes that the Government should recognise the state of Palestine alongside the state of Israel, as a contribution to securing a negotiated two state solution. The measure is mainly symbolic and is not binding on the government. However, it lends added weight within Europe to calls for Palestinian statehood. Ten days earlier, the new government in Sweden said it would recognize a Palestinian state. ""A two-state solution requires mutual recognition and a will to coexist peacefully. Therefore, Sweden will recognise the State of Palestine,"" said Prime Minister Stefan Lofven in his first statement of government policy. 'Not a gift, but a right' The UK vote came after five hours of debate in the House. Former Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, of the Conservative Party, told MPs that during his time in office in the 1990s, the United Kingdom committed ""for the first time to a two-state solution with a Palestinian state."" ""I have never wavered in that view and I believe that the earlier that state comes about the better, both for the Palestinians and for the Middle East as a whole,"" he said. Shadow foreign minister Ian Lucas, of the opposition Labour Party, said the motion would be supported by his party but that the timing and manner of deciding whether to recognize Palestinian statehood was a matter for the current coalition government. ""It will be decided by Labour in government if the decision has not been made by this government before Labour comes to power,"" he said. The next general election will be held in May next year. ""We fully support two states living side by side in peace, recognized by all their neighbors. We are clear that Palestinian statehood is not a gift to be given, but a right to be recognized,"" he said. U.N. vote . The UK government's official goal ""is a negotiated two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, resulting in a secure and universally recognised Israel living alongside a sovereign and viable Palestinian state, based on the borders of 1967, with Jerusalem the future capital of both states, and a just, fair and agreed solution for refugees."" In 2012, the United Nations General Assembly voted to grant the status of ""non-member observer state,"" similar to the Vatican, giving Palestinians a certain implicit degree of statehood recognition. However, a Palestinian bid in 2011 for recognition as a full member of the United Nations failed. It became apparent that the bid was not going to receive the requisite nine of 15 Security Council votes, and the United States promised to veto it if it came to a vote. CNN's Lindsay Isaac contributed to this report.","UK lawmakers vote to recognize Palestine as a state after a debate in Parliament .

"(CNN) -- A former death row chef says he will pay for and cook every last meal for condemned inmates himself, after Texas announced it was stopping the tradition. ""We should not get rid of the last meal,"" said Brian Price, an ex-convict who spent a decade in Texas preparing last meals for the condemned. ""Justice is going to be served when this person is executed, but can we not show our softer side? Our compassionate side?"" Last week's audacious last meal request by killer Russell Brewer was the last straw for some in Texas. Brewer was executed September 21 for his role in the infamous racially motivated 1998 dragging death of James Byrd Jr. His last meal request was for two chicken-fried steaks smothered in gravy with sliced onions, a triple-meat bacon cheeseburger, a cheese omelet with other ingredients, a large bowl of fried okra with ketchup, three fajitas, a pint of Blue Bell ice cream and a pound of barbecue with a half-loaf of white bread. Just for good measure, Brewer added a slab of peanut butter fudge with crushed peanuts, a pizza and three root beers. Then he ate none of it. Not a bite. ""Enough is enough,"" said Texas state Sen. John Whitmire, a day after the execution. ""It is extremely inappropriate to give a person sentenced to death such a privilege -- one which the perpetrator did not provide to their victim."" Texas prison officials agreed with Whitmire, immediately halting the tradition of letting an inmate about to be executed choose the menu for his or her last meal. ""Texas has always been coldhearted about these type of things,"" said Price. ""Not to minimize these crimes, the majority of them have earned their place at that dinner table. But with my offer it would not cost Texas taxpayers anything."" Price said he knows all too well the angst some in Texas may feel about baking cakes or grilling steaks for the perpetrators of some of the most heinous crimes in the state. Price dealt with the same feelings years ago during a 14-year prison term for assault. His job in the facility included cooking meals to fill the sometimes extravagant requests of men who were about to be executed. ""I used to research the crimes and wonder, 'How could I prepare a meal for this guy?'"" Price said. Price had little empathy for the convicts on death row until he had a conversation with Manny Lopez, an inmate who was tasked with cleaning the death chamber after executions. ""Manny told me that cleaning the blood off the gurney did not affect him,"" Price said. ""He said what got to him was washing the handprints, smeared lipstick, tear stains off the windows of the witness room where the man's family was watching him die."" Price said he began to imagine if the people on death row were his family members. ""I would just act like it was my brother who was going to be on that gurney, and then I would cook,"" Price said. He wrote about his experiences and the almost 200 meals he prepared in a book titled ""Meals to Die For."" Since leaving prison he has opened a restaurant and married. He says he thinks about his conversation with Lopez often and he really wants to keep the tradition of a last meal alive. But it seems that Texas will not take Price up on his offer. ""While we appreciate Mr. Price's offer, it's not the cost but more the concept that we're moving away from,"" said Texas Department of Criminal Justice spokesman Jason Clark.","A recent large, uneaten death row meal pushed Texas officials to end the last meal tradition .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Rich Cronin of the 1990s boy band LFO has died, his bandmate told CNN Wednesday. Cronin, who fought a long battle with leukemia, was 36. The band is best known for its top 10 U.S. hits ""Girls on TV"" and ""Summer Girls,"" with Cronin writing the latter. Cronin was diagnosed with leukemia in 2005 and underwent chemotherapy, said bandmate Brad Fischetti. The leukemia returned in 2007 or 2008, and doctors treated it with a stem cell transplant, Fischetti said. Cronin suffered a stroke, an adverse reaction to the treatment, and was left with severe pain in his leg, according to Fischetti. He did not know whether Cronin was battling leukemia again when he died in a Massachusetts hospital Wednesday, he said. The trio had a monster hit with its debut album, LFO. ""Summer Girls,"" from the album, was the group's highest charting song and was nominated for a Billboard Music Award. In 2009, the trio reunited for a summer tour. Fischetti said he and their third bandmate, Devin Lima, gave Cronin the large back bedroom of their tour bus so he could rest up for the shows. ""We had the best time ever,"" Fischetti said. ""He never thought he'd be on stage again."" He said Fischetti told him recently he was having some trouble walking. When Fischetti sent Cronin a text message last week to wish him a happy birthday, he did not get a reply -- which he said was uncharacteristic. He found out Wednesday morning that Cronin had died. He chuckled that some media outlets have been reporting Cronin's age as 33. ""Rich liked to play with his age,"" he said.","The trio is best known for its song ""Summer Girls""

"(CNN) -- Carl Fields flips through hundreds of job applications he's filled out during the last 20 months of unemployment. ""I feel that I am going to get a job,"" he says. ""I just feel it in my bones and my spirit that I am going to get a job. ... It's just a matter of when."" Fields, 59, is an African-American in Plainsboro, New Jersey, with a bachelor's degree who has been unemployed since February 2009. He was let go from his job as a vice president at a large insurance brokerage firm. He had worked there for more than 25 years. He is also a devout Christian with an enormous amount of faith that he soon will be employed again. Unfortunately, there are a slew of statistics that suggest his optimism may be unwarranted. ""It's been a devastating recession for American society. We haven't seen unemployment rates like this since the '40s or around the Depression,"" says Melvin Oliver, co-author of ""Black Wealth/White Wealth: A New Perspective on Racial Inequality."" ""For African-Americans, it's been a tsunami. It's been just a catastrophic event."" For black male college graduates 25 and older, the unemployment rate is 7.8 percent, as of August, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It's 4.4 percent for white male college graduates older than 25. The unemployment rate for whites was 8.7 percent in September, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. For blacks, it was 16.1 percent. The difference is often explained by a lack of college education among many blacks. But even college-educated blacks are unemployed at a higher rate than whites. ""The college-educated black population is still predominantly in government jobs, which we've seen a lot of cutbacks,"" Oliver says. ""They're predominantly in the retail sector and they're in parts of the corporate sector that are the first to go. And this is one of the issues that we have: that our highly educated African-Americans are still getting trained in areas that are most vulnerable in the economy. They're not the dynamic, growing parts of the economy."" The unemployment rate doesn't tell the whole story. The Labor Department also issues an employment-population ratio, which tracks what percentage of a given population is employed. A little more than 64 percent of black males were employed in December 2007 when the recession began. By last month, that figure had dropped to 56.9 percent. While not all of the people represented in that drop are involuntarily out of a job, a significant portion are. Economist Julianne Malveaux says the employment-population ratio represents ""families that are not accumulating [wealth]. These are families that have children who are going to college. And they're saying, 'I can't help you. I don't have anything for you.' "" That's the case for Fields and his wife, Lynette Clark Fields. Cameron Clark, the youngest of their children, was attending Morehouse College until last spring. He had to leave, partly because his grades were poor, and partly because the Fieldses didn't have the money for him to stay. ""The financial condition of this family says we can't afford you to [be] back at Morehouse. We cannot afford that level of tuition. It just cannot happen,"" Carl Fields says. Clark is now in community college, and his grades are better. He hopes to return to Morehouse soon. ""When my blessing comes through, then there will probably be a blessing extended to Cameron to go back,"" Fields says. ""We're not sure when that will be."" Fields' next ""blessing"" may not be as profitable as his last job. A Gallup Poll says that ""underemployment"" for blacks was 28.3 percent in May. That means more than a quarter of employed blacks are working for less money at jobs beneath their skill or education levels. Fields says he realizes and accepts that he may not ever work in a job at his skill level ever again. Every day he goes to the library to surf the job boards and fill out applications. ""Not all of those are in my career discipline,"" he says, nodding to the jobs pulled up on a computer screen. ""It doesn't really matter. ... I've been out of the picky mode for quite some time."" This former vice president has recently applied for positions as an administrative assistant and warehouse clerk. One version of his résumé leaves off his vice president title so that employers don't automatically weed him out as ""overqualified."" In addition to the online applications, Fields has attended more than a dozen job fairs, but he says he leaves every one feeling frustrated. ""I go despite the results because I never know if the next job fair is going to be the one where that job, the next career will come from. It causes me to keep going,"" he says. In the end, it may be his faith -- or at least his church -- that leads to a job. When Fields' influential pastor, the Rev. Buster Soaries, found out he was looking for work after more than a year and a half, the minister asked some of his more connected members to put some feelers out for Fields. That hasn't yielded Fields a job ... yet. But he says he's still hopeful.","Carl Fields, 59, is an African-American with a college degree who has been unemployed for a year and a half.
He is one of many black males unemployed, which statistics show are almost double the number of white males.
Fields is also looking to his church for not only spiritual guidance but help in finding a job, too."
"Los Angeles, California (CNN)  -- Erykah Badu shed her clothes as she walked along a Dallas, Texas, sidewalk until she was nude and then fell near where President Kennedy was assassinated. The result was a controversial video, released Saturday, for her song ""Window Seat,"" which Badu said was ""shot guerrilla style"" with no crew and in one take March 17. Children could be seen nearby as Badu stripped in Dealey Plaza, a popular tourist spot since Kennedy's 1963 assassination. The singer's management did not immediately respond to request for comment, but Badu responded to the controversy via Twitter. She tweeted that ""there were children there. i prayed they wouldnt b traumatized."" Badu will not face indecent exposure charges for shedding her clothes on the Dallas, Texas, sidewalk, a Dallas Police spokeswoman said. Although children were nearby, no one filed a complaint against Badu after the March 17 incident, Dallas Police Senior Cpl. Janice Crowther said. ""But if we had had a call and would have caught Ms. Badu in the act of walking down the street taking her clothes off, she would have been charge with a Class B misdemeanor,"" she said. The R&B singer said she was making a statement against ""groupthink,"" which she tweeted was an ""unwritten rule"" that ""i will not express my true opinion if it opposes those i love and fear."" Some fans sent tweets praising Badu's artistic vision. One fan tweeted to Badu on Sunday: ""thank you, because your being brave, i no longer feel afraid to say what i really feel."" The video opens with a November 22, 1963, radio broadcast describing Kennedy's motorcade turning onto Elm Street seconds before fatal shots were fired. In the video, Badu is behind the wheel of a 1965 Lincoln Continental, parked along Kennedy's route. A single camera focuses on her as she walks toward Elm Street and the book depository where Kennedy's assassin fired his rifle. Badu tweeted that ""i was petrified while shooting this video ... but liberation began to set in. i conquered many fears in that few moments."" She said she was ""too busy lookin for cops"" to be embarrassed by her nudity. ""i been naked all along in my words actions and deeds. thats the real vulnerable place,"" she tweeted. The video does not include shouts from people off camera, she said. ""they were yelling, 'THIS IS A PUBLIC PLACE : YOU OUGHTA BE ASHAMED : PUT YOUR CLOTHES ON : DAMN GIRL! etc,"" Badu tweeted. More than a dozen people stood along the plaza's ""grassy knoll"" when Badu took off the last piece of clothing. ""the people caught in the shot were trying hard to ignore me,"" she tweeted. As she reached the spot where Kennedy was first struck by a bullet, the crackle of a gunshot is heard and Badu's head snaps back and she falls to the ground as if dead. Badu said when the camera stopped ""we ran."" The singer was born in Dallas, where she is raising her three children -- ages 1, 5 and 12 . She tweeted to fans about her 5-year-old daughter's response when told of her plans for the video: ""she looked at me with a blank face and replied ok mama can i have another pudding?"" The video was released days before the singer's next album, ""New Amerykah Part Two: Return of the Ankh,"" hits record stores. The single ""Window Seat"" is at No. 28 on Billboard's R&B/hip-hop chart.","Singer Erykah Badu strips in controversial video for her song ""Window Seat""

"(CNN) -- What kind of people spend thousands of dollars transforming their front yard into a landscape of tombstones and singing skeletons, complete with a haunted maze and ""Bone Yard Band,"" in the name of Halloween? A retired kindergarten teacher and his cooperative wife, of course. At this time of year, however, Gary and Mary Server are known to neighbors as ""Scary Gary"" and ""Bloody Mary."" Now in its eighth year, Haunted Hollow is a local attraction in Clarence Center, New York, making it one of many homegrown spooky houses to pop up across the country this Halloween season. With professional haunts costing more than $20 per person in some places, proprietors of homemade affairs say they are hosting more and more visitors each year. ""Scary Gary"" and ""Bloody Mary"" don't ask for money to enter Haunted Hollow, but they accept donations, which they give in full to the Women and Children's Hospital of Buffalo. Two years ago, they raised more than $5,000, Gary Server said. ""My wife and I love Halloween. Also, since I enjoy children so much and they have been such a large part of my life as a teacher, it makes Halloween even more enjoyable to do something for them,"" he said. ""We call it 'family frightful.' We don't do gore or blood. It's a chance for families to spend old-fashioned, quality time together. What's better than that?"" It's not unusual for families to spend hours exploring Haunted Hollow, because there's so much to see, he said. There's an hourly light show and a graveyard of 100 tombstones, ghouls and monsters named for their grandson, Josh. A homemade hearse contains a ""Bone Yard Band"" of animatronic singing skulls. A crowd favorite, Victor the Talking Skeleton, communicates to visitors from his cage with the help of a remote microphone and an infrared camera monitored by one of Server's buddies from his living room. Do-it-yourself Halloween decorating 101 . A maze in the four-car garage leads you to a caged ""insane asylum"" of fright flick favorites including Michael Myers, Freddie Kruger and Jason. CNN iReporter Deanna Rodrigues visited Haunted Hollow last Saturday with her 4-year-old son and spent nearly two hours exploring. Her son's favorite attraction was the garage maze, which has an electric chair that rattles and groans and lets off smoke when you sit on it, she said. ""He had a good time. He didn't want to leave,"" she said. ""Real live ghouls roam around the stand behind bushes and 'boo' you."" It's a large undertaking to set the scene for thousands of visitors each year. Dozens of friends pitch in and they get a little help from students who volunteer for high school credit, which is why they do it every other year, Server said. ""It's really a lot of fun but we do it every two years because it's much work. It takes us three months to get ready,"" he said. Kimberly Stegman and Andrew Adkins of Springdale, Ohio, also take several months to prepare their House of Hell, a graveyard of zombies and monsters that has grow in size over the past eight years. Each year brings more visitors, Adkins said. About 300 visitors came by last weekend, not including the retirement home bus and hayride that passed by. The house on Glen Sharon Road has also become a local legend. iReporter Greg Reese made a point of visiting Saturday after missing it last year. As he pulled his car up to the house, he was greeted by a chainsaw-wielding Jason from the movie ""Halloween."" ""Others down the street are starting to dress up their house because of the response,"" Reese said. ""He obviously takes a lot of time on the creatures."" The couple don't charge visitors a fee to view the collection of 17 zombies and monsters, each of which Adkins makes by hand. This year's new addition: the infamous scene from ""The Exorcist"" of the possessed young girl strapped to a bed. It was simple, really, he said. A nurse friend gave him a gown and scrubs for clothes, and he made the body out of packing foam and the bed from wood left over at work. ""The thing that cost the most was the mask of her face, which I found online. But I didn't like how it looked so I painted over it to make it look better,"" he said. It's a true labor of love that goes back to childhood, when he'd construct his own tombstone decorations of cardboard for his mother's home. ""I love Halloween, it's just like Christmas,"" he said. ""As much as I like Halloween and horror movies, I'll keep doing it until I can't anymore. I have more space in the backyard so I'll probably end up there next year.""","Homeowners take joy in transforming property into Halloween attractions .

"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- The United States is banning the importation of four species of snakes and their eggs, the Interior Department announced Tuesday. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar announced the ban -- which covers the Burmese python, the northern and southern African pythons, and the yellow anaconda -- at a news conference at Everglades National Park in South Florida, where non-native snakes have become a serious problem. Park officials called the announcement a great first step for the park's ecosystem. ""We are very happy to see this finally in place,"" said park spokeswoman Linda Friar. ""The python has continued to be an increasing challenge in management and we are hoping this will help us get a better handle on this species."" The biggest threat to the park is the non-native Burmese python. It is believed that the snakes were originally pets that found their way into the park. The Everglades, known as the river of grass, is a vast area with a climate perfect for the pythons to hide and breed. And breed they do: The largest clutch found in the Everglades was 83 eggs. ""We think there are tens of thousands of snakes (in the park),"" said Friar. The snakes prey on native wildlife such as the endangered Key Largo wood rat and the endangered wood stork. The largest prey, Friar said, was a 76-pound deer that was found in the stomach of a 16-foot python a few months ago. The ban will not affect people who currently own these four species of snakes, other than prohibiting the transportation or selling of the animals across state lines. The ban should be in place by the end of March, when the snakes will be included under the Lacey Act. The act is designed to stop illegal trafficking of specified wildlife, fish and plants. A felony violation of the Lacey Act can bring a five-year prison sentence and a $250,000 fine. Although the ban should put a stop to additional pythons entering the country, officials say it will not solve the snake problem in the Everglades. ""We still have to look at improved management and removal to better protect our habitat,"" Friar said.","Interior Department announces ban on importing four non-native snake species .

"London (CNN) -- Dan Brown's ""The Da Vinci Code"" encouraged amateur ""symbologists"" everywhere to scan their favorite paintings for secret codes -- but the practice has been going on for centuries. From the inscrutable prehistoric cave drawings inside the Chauvet Caves in Southern France to the abstract paintings of Jackson Pollock, artists have kept the intentions and significance of their work close to their chests. Famously opaque paintings include Bronzino's 1545 work ""An Allegory with Venus and Cupid,"" which contains allegorical figures even scholars aren't able to decipher. Still, historians often discover hidden images, symbols and texts in works of art. CNN World's Treasures selects examples of such discoveries -- some reputable, others outlandish. 'Twentieth Scene of the Life of St. Francis,' Giotto di Bondone . The latest example is the discovery of a profile of the devil, secreted in this fresco by thirteenth-century Italian artist Giotto di Bondone at the Basilica of Saint Francis in Assisi. Italian art historian Chiara Frugoni discovered the hook-nosed, smirking devil hidden in the swirls of a cloud. She believes it refers to the Medieval belief that devils would appear in the clouds to arrest the soul's ascent into heaven. 'Mona Lisa,' Leonardo da Vinci . Leonardo da Vinci's painting of an enigmatic smiling woman has been a source of intrigue for years. In 2010 the president of Italy's National Committee for Cultural Heritage, Silvano Vinceti, was convinced he had discovered letters and numbers embedded in the eyes of the portrait, which he found after digitally magnifying it. Initially, Vinceti's discovery of the letters L and V was taken as proof of the well-worn theory that the ""Mona Lisa"" is in fact a portrait of da Vinci himself. Vinceti then arrived at the conclusion that it was a painting of one of da Vinci's male associates, though other art historians have been quick to debunk the idea. 'Battle of Marciano,' Giorgio Vasari . This fresco in the Hall of Five Hundred in Florence's Palazzo Vecchio is believed to hold the key to a long-lost work by Leonardo da Vinci. Art diagnostic expert Maurizio Seracini is convinced that da Vinci's fresco ""The Battle of Anghiari"" lies behind ""The Battle of Marciano."" Writer and painter Vasari, a great admirer of da Vinci's, wrote about him beginning work on the fresco but abandoning it part of the way through due to technical problems. On a tiny painted green flag in Vasari's fresco are the words ""Cerca, trova"" -- in English, ""seek and you shall find."" Seracini is hoping to use forensic techniques to get behind Vasari's fresco and see whether ""The Battle of Anghiari"" really does lie behind it. 'Sistine Chapel,' Michelangelo . Michelangelo's sublime Sistine Chapel at the Vatican in Rome received a thorough restoration and cleaning towards the end of the twentieth century, revealing this Renaissance masterwork in all its colorful, complex glory. But according to Roy Doliner, co-author of the book ""The Sistine Secrets: Michelangelo's Forbidden Messages in the Heart of the Vatican,"" the restoration also revealed some seditious and previously unnoticed communications. One discovery was of a painting of a young Jewish man, Amminadab, wearing the sign of persecution prevalent at the time in Italy on his clothing, and apparently making a rude hand-gesture directly over where the Pope's throne would have been. Another discovery was of two Jews in the inner circle of the elect in the towering ""Last Judgement"" -- ""total blasphemy for the 1500s,"" according to Doliner. It is his belief that Michelangelo was secretly preaching ideas of acceptance during a time of religious intolerance. 'The Last Supper,' Leonardo da Vinci . One of the more outlandish theories about this work (which featured as the central clue in the plot of ""The Da Vinci Code"") is that the undulating composition of the disciples' hands and the bread rolls on the table correspond to musical notes on a stave. Strung together, the tune supposedly resembles a requiem -- a song for the dead. Leonardo was a talented musician in addition to his other great talents; perhaps a musical painting isn't entirely out of the question? 'The Supper at Emmaus,' Caravaggio . Caravaggio's 1601 painting ""The Supper at Emmaus"" may not have a hidden message that we know of but it does contains subtle symbols hinting at the identity of the mysterious, beardless man at the table. An important clue is the shadow of a fishtail coming off the bowl of fruit magically hovering at the edge of the table, a just-visible sign that the man at the table is Christ, the fisher of men. Another is the way all lines, like those in ""The Last Supper,"" point to the beardless man at the head of the table -- Christ, in disguise.","Symbols and hidden messages often discovered in historical paintings -- some credible, others less so .

"(CNN) -- Polygamy is back in the headlines. Last week, a federal judge in Utah struck down part of the state's anti-polygamy law as unconstitutional, although he kept the ban on possessing more than one marriage license at a time. Fans of the ""Sister Wives"" reality TV stars, who filed the suit, are rejoicing in the news. At the other end of the spectrum, TLC debuted its newest docuseries, ""Breaking the Faith,"" which tells the dark story of women and children trying to escape from the practice. Another lawsuit filed by the Department of Justice alleges that polygamous clans are secretly running the show in Utah and Arizona townships, manipulating the political process from behind the scenes. And in Texas, the Attorney General's Office is inching closer to seizing a massive polygamous ranch. Across the country, angry citizens are calling for the government to follow its own laws and crack down on polygamy. Meanwhile, celebrities like Akon and various news outlets encourage people of all ages to reconsider plural marriage. What competing narratives about polygamy in America reveal is that whether or not a white-washed, clean-cut version of plural marriage could in theory legally exist, in practice it does not, and what states like Utah, Arizona and Texas actually have is an unregulated, dangerous and harmful situation, where the strong prey upon the weak and helpless. The time has come to address this discrepancy. When the Supreme Court struck down the federal Defense of Marriage Act in U.S. v. Windsor in June, opening the door to federal recognition of same-sex marriage, it also set the stage for a discussion of plural marriage. DOMA defined marriage as ""a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife."" While DOMA obviously prohibited same-sex marriage (by requiring that a marital unit consist of a man and a woman), it also enshrined the prohibition against polygamy, by requiring that such a union be between only one man and one woman. Even before Windsor the Supreme Court had declared morals-based legislation invalid, renewing interest in polygamy. But in calling DOMA definitions unconstitutionally restrictive, the court, perhaps unwittingly, also struck down the federal numerical limitation in a marriage, immediately re-opening the possibility of plural marriage at the state level. Activists have taken note, and are only getting louder. But despite the strength of any legal arguments, and the voices of a few, plural marriage is still a crime, and public opinion remains strongly in favor of the ban. Studies show that it tends to create abusive relationships antithetical to family values. Co-wives who lose favor are pushed aside for new and often younger rivals; left to fend for themselves and their children with dwindling resources and support, they are exploited by emotionally detached husbands. Advocates say the harms are not intrinsic to the practice; they do not support underage or coercive relationships. They challenge us to crack down on abuses in general, irrespective of marital model. Polygamy might not be inherently evil, which is why we need purposeful debates. But unlike traditional marriage, it has never been effectively regulated and so people, especially women and children, have suffered. The real beauty of last summer's ruling is that it not only opened the door for polygamy, it also established a framework. Same-sex relationships that were only decriminalized in earlier cases were finally given legal recognition in Windsor. If there is to be a change in status quo -- if we as a nation decide that polygamy cannot or should not be illegal -- then going straight from criminalization to full recognition is both the correct legal answer and necessary to assuage public fears. Decriminalizing polygamy would only make abuses even harder to catch. But following Windsor's lead and allowing these relationships to be recognized could instead bring them into the light. Recognition would enable law enforcement to crack down on abuse; allow an independent civil authority -- a town clerk or justice of the peace -- to express concerns about and even refuse to approve an inappropriate marriage. It would help prosecutors overcome the evidentiary hurdles inherent in prosecuting related crimes. Unlike decriminalization, legalizing and regulating polygamy cuts to the heart of policy concerns. Morals-based legislation has been unconstitutional since 2003's Lawrence v. Texas, and so we cannot just continue ignoring the polygamists' clamor for acceptance. But the practical policy solution -- awarding those formerly banned relationships rights, and with those rights accompanying duties and responsibilities, which will be monitored -- was only handed down last summer. A clean-cut version of American polygamy does not currently exist, but under Windsor, perhaps, we could actually build it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mark Goldfeder.","A judge in Utah struck down part of the state's anti-polygamy law as unconstitutional .
Mark Goldfeder: In practice, polygamy exists even if legally it is not recognized .
He says U.S. needs to address polygamy, possibly find a way to make it legal .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Promoters yanked the rock band KISS from the Michael Jackson tribute show Tuesday after fans called their attention to negative remarks KISS leader Gene Simmons made about the pop star in the weeks after his death. The reversals came a day after Katherine Jackson appeared live on CNN to announce the addition of KISS to the lineup for ""Michael Forever: The Tribute Concert,"" scheduled for October 8 in Cardiff, Wales. ""We have listened to Michael's fans and are grateful to have been alerted to these unfortunate statements by Gene Simmons,"" Global Live Events CEO Chris Hunt told CNN Tuesday. Fan clubs appeared in open revolt against the tribute show after promoters added the group. Fan websites pointed to published interviews in which Simmons spoke about his suspicions that Jackson, who was acquitted of child molestation in 2005, was a pedophile. The executors of the Michael Jackson estate also spoke out late Monday, sending a letter to the promoters saying they were ""especially disappointed"" by the announcement that KISS was in the show. The estate asked promoters to provide an explanation. ""As I am sure you are aware, Mr. Simmons has made numerous disparaging public comments about Michael Jackson after his passing,"" estate lawyer Howard Weitzman wrote in the letter obtained by CNN. He called media coverage of the controversy ""extraordinarily embarrassing."" The estate, which has not sanctioned the event, also questioned the promoters' promise to share profits with charities and a provision in the terms of the ticket sale that so long as 50% of the billed acts show up there would be no refunds,. ""It is a concern to us that loyal Michael Jackson fans will pay for tickets and not receive full benefit for their purchase, nor will they be able to get a full refund if certain artists they paid to see cancel their participation,"" the letter said. The promoters replied Tuesday morning. ""Under the circumstances we fully agree that even though KISS is a band Michael admired, we have no choice but to rescind our invitation to them to appear in our tribute concert,"" Hunt said. Promoters, who had hoped the addition of the legendary group would bolster their lineup, said they were unaware of Simmons' statements when they booked KISS for the show. ""We offer our sincerest apologies to Mrs. Jackson and the family for this oversight. Our primary concern must be to do justice to Michael's memory, and to put on a tribute that the family and the fans will find suitable and fit for a King, our King of Pop,"" Hunt said. Simmons' comments were well-known among many Jackson fans. Fan websites quickly posted scathing objections after Monday's announcement. ""In the days following Michael Jackson's death, Gene Simmons has made slanderous, derogatory comments about Michael and his children,"" the fan site United For Michael Jackson's Legacy said. ""It is quite ironic that Simmons has now agreed to himself pay tribute to the man he called a child predator."" The fan website MJ4Justice was one of several calling for a boycott of the show. ""Either they don't have access to computers, telephones or do not know how to use GOOGLE,"" MJ4Justice said in an online statement. ""But, There is NO excuse for the Tribute organizers NOT to know Gene Simmons should not be part of any Michael Jackson Tribute Event."" Global Live Events executives appeared with Jackson matriarch Katherine Jackson on CNN Monday to announce the signing of KISS. ""I know he would be very excited about KISS,"" Michael Jackson's mother said. But within minutes, their tribute's Facebook page was filled with negative fan reactions. ""This is a complete disgrace,"" wrote one fan. ""You can kiss your audience goodbye folks. I doubt whether any self-respecting fan will pay a penny to see that man after the comments he made about Michael. I'm shocked this act was even considered."" The KISS controversy overshadowed other announcements that promoters expected would gain fan support for their show, including word that many of the musicians who played in Jackson's touring band for the past two decades would reunite as the show's house band. Kevin Dorsey, who served as musical director for several Michael Jackson tours, will direct the show. Other acts signed for the show include Christina Aguilera, Leona Lewis, Smokey Robinson, Cee Lo Green and JLS. Alternative rock band Alien Ant Farm and British R&B singer Craig David are also on the bill. Members of the Jackson family set to take the stage include ""the next generation of Jacksons"" and 3T, which consists of Tito Jackson's three sons, the promoters said. It is also expected that one or more of the three Jackson sisters -- Janet, La Toya and Rebe -- will perform. It appeared unlikely the tribute stage would be the scene for a reunion for the surviving members of the Jackson 5. While Jackie, Tito and Marlon support the concert, brothers Jermaine and Randy have publicly objected to the show being held at the same time as the trial for Michael Jackson's doctor. ""While we wholeheartedly support the spirit of a tribute that honors our brother, we find it impossible to support an event that is due to take place during the criminal trial surrounding Michael's death,"" Jermaine and Randy Jackson said in a joint statement last month. Dr. Conrad Murray's involuntary manslaughter trial is scheduled to begin in September and is expected to continue through October. ""The trial is very important and I can understand how Randy and Jermaine feel, but it's been two years,"" Katherine Jackson told CNN Monday. ""I thought it was a good idea; I'd like to keep Michael's legacy alive."" Katherine Jackson plans to attend the trial, although she will miss some days to fly to Wales to attend the show with Michael Jackson's children, she said. ""It will be on a Saturday when the courtroom is dark,"" said Paul Ring, a Global Live Events executive. Fans can get tickets through a two-step process. They must first ""register their interest for tickets"" online at http://www.michaelforevertribute.com/. A lottery then will decide which fans will be e-mailed invitations to complete the ticket purchase. The concert in the Wales Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, which seats 75,000 people, will be at least four hours long, Global Live Events CEO Chris Hunt said.","NEW: ""We have listened to Michael's fans,"" the promoter says .

"JAKARTA, Indonesia (CNN) -- Responsible for shaping modern Indonesia, Haji Muhammad Suharto was known as the ""smiling general,"" but his legacy as one of the great Cold War era strongmen was built on corruption and a reign of violence that left hundreds of thousands dead. Suharto died after being admitted to hospital suffering from anemia. He died on January 27 in hospital at the age of 86 after being treated for liver, heart and lung disease. He had been admitted to hospital on January 4 suffering from anemia. He had already been weakened by strokes in recent years that gave him brain damage and impaired speech but prevented him from being put on trial. Suharto rose to power by crushing an alleged communist uprising in 1965 after his political rivals were mysteriously eliminated. His iron-fist rule went unchallenged until widespread protests in 1998, when his downfall ushered democracy into the world's fourth largest nation. Born into a poor rice-farming family on Java island in 1921, Suharto received military training first in the Dutch colonial army and then in a collaborationist unit set up by Japanese occupiers in World War II. He later joined the Indonesian army that resisted Dutch efforts to regain control over its former colony. After Indonesia became independent in 1949, Suharto climbed the ranks as a favorite of founding President Sukarno, eventually becoming a five-star general. A murky military rebellion in 1965 saw his fellow senior officers killed, allowing Suharto to assert his control of the armed forces before easing Sukarno from power. It was during that period that Suharto embarked on a nationwide purge of alleged communists overseen by his powerful military. Human rights groups estimate anywhere between 500,000 to a million people were killed. Although Indonesia is still struggling to come to terms with the bloodletting and graft of the Suharto era, many ordinary people also remember the drastic improvements in quality of life experienced under their ""father of development."" Before financial meltdown put the brakes on the country's booming economy, Western-educated financial experts helped transform Indonesia from a Southeast Asian backwater into a key regional player, replete with gleaming skyscrapers and soaring toll roads. But the price of success was high. In 1975, his troops invaded the territory of East Timor -- with the tacit support of Western allies keen to prop up an anti-communist leader. The ensuing occupation lasted more than two decades and killed more than 100,000 people, according to human rights groups. His aim was to keep the sprawling Indonesian archipelago together. Separatist rebellions were quickly crushed, while democratic elections were rigged to re-elect Suharto year after year. Political opponents were routinely kidnapped and tortured. As billions of dollars of foreign investment poured in to oil-rich Indonesia's transformed economy, huge sums were siphoned off by Suharto's cronies and family, who became lavish spenders in a poor country -- oblivious to growing resentment among its 210 million people. The Asian financial crisis of 1997 plunged Indonesia into economic free fall and unleashed a wave of anti-Suharto violence. Students led a massive popular uprising, storming parliament, before the dictator finally stood down in May 1998. In his final years, Suharto lived to witness the dismantling of his regime. Far-flung regions, once subdued by force, erupted into violence. East Timor gained independence in 2002, and two years later Indonesians appointed their first democratically elected president. Many hoped Suharto's wrongs would be exposed in court. Instead, his children were prosecuted. Tommy Suharto, the youngest and the most flamboyant, was jailed for corruption. Suharto himself never stood trial. Indonesia's Supreme Court decreed that the former strongman, who suffered from strokes and heart problems in his final years, was permanently ill and unfit to stand trial. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- An Alabama judge on Thursday abruptly dismissed the murder case against a man accused in the scuba-diving death of his newlywed wife off Australia's coast. The decision from Judge Tommy Nail came near the end of the second full week of David Gabriel ""Gabe"" Watson's trial in Birmingham. According to Ken Glass, the judge's judicial assistant, Nail dismissed the case ""after the state rested its case against Gabe Watson (and) the defense filed a motion for a judgment of acquittal due to a lack of evidence."" ""I'm going to grant the defendant's motion for acquittal. This case is dismissed,"" Nail said, prompting an outburst of applause in the courtroom. Afterward, a visibly emotional Watson put his face in his hands, then began hugging people around the room. His 26-year-old wife, Tina, died October 22, 2003, while the pair were diving at a historic shipwreck off the Great Barrier Reef -- some 9,000 miles from Birmingham, where the two had wed 11 days earlier. His father, David Watson, called the entire situation ""terrible, it's tragic,"" while expressing satisfaction with the judge's decision. ""I'm just thrilled for Gabe, and I just hope everybody can begin to heal, get their lives back together,"" said David Watson, calling his son a ""good kid."" Prosecutor Don Valeska said ""this case is over forever,"" since there is no appeal possible. ""I strongly disagree with him,"" Valeska said of Nail. ""I'm just extremely stunned, and I'm at a loss for words."" That sentiment was echoed by Tommy Thomas, Tina's father, who said ""we're very disappointed"" by Nail's decision. ""There just seems to be a lot more protection for the accused than there does consideration for the victim, which in this case was Tina,"" Thomas said. After his wife's death, Watson returned from Australia -- where media dubbed him ""The Honeymoon Killer"" -- to the United States and remarried five years later. That same year, in 2008, he pleaded guilty in Australia to criminally negligent manslaughter and subsequently served 18 months in prison in that country. In October 2010, an Alabama grand jury indicted Watson on two counts -- murder for pecuniary gain and kidnapping where a felony occurred. Those charges were based on the premise that Watson hatched the plot to kill his wife while in Alabama. The doctrine of double jeopardy -- which says that a person cannot be tried or punished twice for the same crime -- did not apply because two separate sovereigns, a state government and a foreign government, were seeking to prosecute, said John Lentine, a Birmingham criminal defense attorney and law school professor. After his sentence was complete, the Australian government held Watson for a short time in immigration detention in light of its policy of not extraditing anyone who might face the death penalty. Australian authorities deported him back to the United States after getting assurance from U.S. authorities that ""the death penalty would not be sought, imposed or carried out,"" said Sandi Logan, a spokesman for the Australian Department of Immigration and Citizenship. Watson was then arrested, in November 2010, in Los Angeles. In the opening arguments of Watson's U.S. trial earlier this month, Assistant Attorney General Andrew Arrington told jurors that Watson had changed his story on what happened several times. The prosecution also alleged that Watson had expected to gain about $210,000 in insurance and death benefits due to his new wife's death. ""This whole case ... is about murder and gain,"" Arrington said. But defense attorney Brett Bloomston said that Tina's father was the beneficiary on her workplace insurance policy. Watson filed for some expenses from a travel policy, but it was denied on a technicality, Bloomston said. His client did sue an insurance company when it denied him an accidental death benefit, the attorney said. ""Gabe never stood to gain anything from Tina's death; he lost,"" said Bloomston. The defense argued that Tina Watson was wearing too much weight with her suit when she died, and that a strong current, her relative diving inexperience and a pattern of anxiety during dives were contributing factors. During the trial, Judge Nail spelled out what he believed were the basics of the prosecution's case -- that Gabe Watson had schemed in Alabama to kill his new wife. ""The defendant buys an engagement ring. He gives it to his future bride. He marries her. He plans a trip halfway around the world that's paid for by him or his family,"" Nail said. ""And he did all of that, and planned it all here, so he could go over there and kill her so he could get the same engagement ring he purchased?""

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Three bombs Wednesday in Baghdad struck the convoy of the Polish ambassador to Iraq, wounding the diplomat and killing three others in the entourage, including one of his bodyguards, authorities said. Iraqi soldiers inspect the site of a Baghdad blast that injured the Polish ambassador Wednesday. In addition, the explosions killed two Iraqi civilians and wounded 11 others in the downtown Karrada neighborhood. The convoy's three sport utility vehicles -- all bearing Polish flags -- were hit in the blasts, an Iraqi Interior Ministry official said. The ambassador, Gen. Edward Pietrzyk, was evacuated from the scene by a helicopter from Blackwater USA, the security firm that protects U.S. diplomats, a source told CNN. The deputy chief of the Polish mission said Pietrzyk was released Wednesday afternoon from a U.S. military hospital and was to be taken first to Ramstein Air Base in Germany and then to Poland for further treatment. Officials said the diplomat had a leg wound and suffered burns in the attack. Watch video from the scene of the attack » . The deputy said the U.S. military was handling the investigation. He said he was initially told two or three car bombs were involved. ""The terrorists opened fire after the bombing and our guys returned fire,"" he said. ""We expect the government of Iraq to find those responsible for this deliberate attack and punish them."" Iraqi officials said the strike targeted the convoy, but it was unclear if it was an assassination attempt on Pietrzyk. But the deputy chief of mission was unequivocal, saying, ""In my view it was a deliberate attack to kill."" The blasts were powerful: News footage showed the charred SUVs, a helicopter landing on a rubble-strewn street, heavily equipped soldiers escorting a bandaged man into the craft and a chopper flying away. After the blast, U.S. troops swiftly moved into the area and sealed it. The Americans assisted with evacuation and medical support, said Mirembe Nantongo, a U.S. Embassy spokeswoman in Iraq. Ryan C. Crocker, U.S. ambassador to Iraq, and Gen. David H. Petraeus, the top U.S. commander in the country, condemned the attack. ""Poland has been a strong and steadfast ally here and around the world, and we commend its commitment to a stable and secure Iraq,"" they said in a joint statement. Poland has had a strong presence in the U.S.-led coalition, and its military commands the Multi-National Division-Central South region. Warsaw has a contingent of about 900 troops in the country, according to the Brookings Institution's Iraq Index. Twenty-one Polish troops have died in the Iraq war. In 2004, insurgents attacked the Polish Embassy in Baghdad, but no one was injured. Also Wednesday, Adm. Michael Mullen landed in Baghdad after taking office this week as chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Pentagon officials said. Mullen will spend a week in Iraq and Afghanistan, officials said. Aides said the trip is aimed at giving Mullen an immediate assessment of the situation in both conflicts. In a message to U.S. troops after taking office Monday, he said, ""I know the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are taking a toll on you and your families. ""They are taking a toll on our equipment, our systems, and our ability to train as well. I worry, quite frankly, that they are taking a toll on our readiness for other threats in other places."" Later on Wednesday at least three civilians were killed and seven others were wounded when mortars slammed into two residential neighborhoods in central Samarra, north of Baghdad, police said. The mortars appear to have been targeting a nearby Iraqi army base, police said. In a separate incident, in the town of Ishaqi, 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of the capital, an Iraqi police officer was killed at noon Wednesday by unidentified gunmen as he was leaving the police station. Also, a car bomb explosion in an eastern Baghdad commercial district killed at least one Iraqi civilian and wounded four others Wednesday, an Interior Ministry official said. Meanwhile, a U.S. military commander in Iraq maintained Wednesday that a man arrested last month by American forces in the Iraqi Kurdish region is a key operative from the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' Quds Force. Maj. Gen Kevin Bergner dismissed Iranian claims the man is a businessman. Bergner said Mahmoud Farhady, arrested September 20 in Sulaimaniya, has been in charge of the Zafar Command, one of three units of the Ramazan Corps of the Quds Force. The U.S. military has accused Quds Force agents of training and equipping Iraqi insurgents, an allegation Iran repeatedly has denied. In Washington, Iraq's national security adviser met with top Bush administration officials on Tuesday and Wednesday, according to one of his aides. Mowaffak al-Rubaie conferred with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on Tuesday and was to meet with Vice President Dick Cheney on Wednesday, the aide said. Al-Rubaie and Rice discussed the training of Iraqi security forces, the role of private security companies and the Iraqi neighbors conference to be held in November. E-mail to a friend .

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- The operators of two vessels involved in the ""duck boat"" accident on the Delaware River two summers ago have reached a $17 million settlement with the victims and the families of the two Hungarian students who died that day. The families of the Dora Schwendter and Szabolcs Prem will split $15 million, and nearly 20 other victims who involved in the accident will split $2 million. Schwendter, 16, and Prem, 20, died on July 7, 2010, when a sludge barge towed by a tugboat plowed into the disabled, 33-foot ""Ride the Ducks"" tour boat they were riding on the Delaware River, plunging the amphibious vessel and its 35 passengers and two crew members underwater. Their families filed wrongful death lawsuits against K-Sea Transportation of East Brunswick, New Jersey, which operated the tugboat guiding the barge along the river, and Ride the Ducks of Norcross, Georgia, which operated the tour boat. Ride the Ducks issued a statement saying it is ""glad to bring closure to this sad chapter"" and expressing sympathy, noting that ""as parents ourselves, we are sorry for what they have experienced."" On the second day of a federal trial that began Monday, U.S. District Judge Thomas O'Neill, who presided in the nonjury trial, halted the proceedings and told the parties in the case to work out a settlement. The parties negotiated from noon Tuesday to late Wednesday afternoon. It was not disclosed how the payment of the settlement would be divided by the two companies. A lawyer representing the families of the two victims said the decision was a wake-up call for the transportation industry. ""To lose an only child is a parent's worst nightmare,"" said Robert Mongeluzzi from Saltz, Mongeluzzi, Barrett & Bendesky law firm. ""They still remain in search of closure, but they wanted us to find out what happened and make sure it didn't happen again."" During his opening statement, Mongeluzzi played a video clip of the accident that showed Schwendtner throwing a life preserver to Kyle Burkhardt, the duck boatÂ¹s first mate. ""Sixteen-year-old Dora Schwendtner throws her life preserver to Kyle Burkhard to save his life. And, because of the defendants' failures, she lost hers,"" Mongeluzzi said. In testimony Tuesday, Kevin Grace of Waterloo, Illinois, who was aboard the duck boat with his 9-year-old daughter when it was struck, described the chaos of that day as ""the most horrific thing"" he had ever witnessed. ""The initial impact came with loud screams and cries from the rest of the people on the boat,"" Grace said. ""As I got near the window, the boat turned and pitched, and the river rose up and just swallowed us."" He added that he was unable to secure a life jacket on himself and only managed to get one over his daughter's head. ""The only thing I could do was reach up and grab a handful of hair and just hold on,"" he said. ""Under no circumstances was I going to let go. Her lifeline was my hand on her hair."" ""It was like being a washing machine with a bunch of strange objects, shoes and clothes and people people flailing underwater,"" he said. The distracted tugboat pilot who crashed the barge into the sightseeing craft is serving time in federal prison for his criminal conduct associated with his role in the accident, federal prosecutors said. Matthew R. Devlin, 35, of Catskill, New York, pleaded guilty on August 1, 2011, to one count of misconduct of a ship operator causing death, and was sentenced to a year and a day. In addition to the prison time, he also will spend three years on supervised release. Devlin admitted that he was distracted by his cell phone and laptop for an extended period of time before the collision, that he piloted the tug, the Caribbean Sea, from its lower wheelhouse where he had significantly reduced visibility, and that he did not maintain a proper lookout or comply with other essential rules of seamanship, according to federal prosecutors. He also surrendered his Coast Guard-issued license as a mate, according to federal prosecutors. Based on federal sentencing guidelines, Devlin could have received up to four years in prison.

"Des Moines, Iowa (CNN) -- Coming off a barely-there victory in the Iowa causes, Mitt Romney vowed Wednesday he will continue to focus his campaign on defeating President Obama, rather than Rick Santorum. Sixth-place finisher Michele Bachmann, meanwhile, scheduled a news conference for 11 a.m., ET, fueling speculation that she will withdraw from the race. Santorum virtually tied Romney Tuesday in the nation's first nominating contest, coming in second by only eight votes in what appears to be the closest-ever margin of victory in a Republican presidential contest, the state Republican Party said early Wednesday. ""Of course, people are going to ask us about the differences on our positions on issues and backgrounds and so forth,"" Romney told CNN Wednesday morning. ""But, really, if we talk about what the American people want to hear, it's how we're going to be different than President Obama when it comes to getting the economy going, preserving America's security abroad and making sure we rein in the scale of the federal government. "" The candidates' next contest will be in New Hampshire on Tuesday. Romney said he was ""feeling terrific, because, as you know, we were well behind several weeks ago,"" when polls suggested Newt Gingrich was in the lead in Iowa. ""I don't think many people gave us a shot of beating"" Gingrich, Romney said. ""We obviously won last night, although it was very, very close,. Obviously, Rick Santorum and Ron Paul also had big nights. We all came out of Iowa a lot stronger. "" Ron Paul finished a close third, according to the state GOP. ""Game on!"" Santorum tweeted. """"Thanks to all of you, we pulled off our #iowasurprise! Keep us going to NH, SC & beyond."" The South Carolina Republican primary is scheduled for January 21. Santorum's website Wednesday automatically took visitors to a donation page celebrating the ""Iowa Surprise"" and saying Santorum proved ""he is the only conservative who can beat Mitt Romney."" Paul, meanwhile, told CNN his success in Iowa shows ""the message of liberty is appealing to everybody across the board."" In New Hampshire, he said, ""I think we're going to have some momentum and we're going to continue to do what we're doing. It's a 'live free or die' state. They're very freedom-oriented,and that message will spread there. And I'm confident we will do quite well."" Despite a weak showing among voters in Iowa looking for a candidate they consider conservative, Romney told CNN he is confident that conservative voters will support him in New Hampshire. Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who placed fifth in Iowa, said late Tuesday that he would return to his home state to consider whether his campaign would continue. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, had 30,015 votes. Santorum, a former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania and an upstart challenger who just weeks ago polled in the single digits, had 30,007, the state GOP said. Each had roughly 25% of the vote in Iowa, the first state to vote in the 2012 presidential caucus and primary season. Paul, a U.S. representative from Texas, had 21%. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich was at 13%. Perry was at 10%, Bachmann -- a Minnesota congresswoman -- had 5%, and former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman had 1%. State GOP officials said certified results will be released in two weeks. The closest previous margin of victory in a GOP presidential contest was 257 in 1936, when Alf Landon won the 1936 South Dakota primary. In 2008, Barack Obama earned the closest-ever margin in a U.S. presidential contest, defeating Hillary Clinton by seven votes in the Guam caucus. Speaking to supporters in Des Moines early Wednesday, before final results were known, Romney framed the Iowa contest as a ""great victory"" for him, Santorum and Paul. ""All three of us will be campaigning very hard to restore the heart and soul of this nation,"" Romney said. Iowa caucus results . On Wednesday, Sen. John McCain plans to travel to New Hampshire to endorse Romney, a senior Republican source close to the senator said. McCain beat Romney to win the Republican presidential nomination in 2008. Romney has long been a front-runner in Iowa and most national polls, though he also has been stuck at roughly the same percentage of support as a revolving cast of conservative challengers bounced up and down, with Santorum the latest to rise. Santorum told CNN early Wednesday -- before the final tally was announced -- that he would turn his attention to New Hampshire, where Romney, who governed neighboring Massachusetts, has had a large lead in polls. ""We're going to be on to New Hampshire. We're going to work hard and compete there,"" Santorum said. ""I'm a little bit behind the curve in the sense that Gov. Romney has spent a lot of money and a lot of time up there, and has been running for six years. But we feel like we can go up there and compete."" Paul, speaking in Iowa late Tuesday, praised his supporters for a ""fantastic showing"" and claimed that he and the top two were the caucuses' ""three winners,"" ready to raise money and compete well in the next contests. ""We have had a fantastic showing for this cause and challenging people ... and saying, you know, this challenge of, 'Let's go back to this real old-fashioned idea, this very dangerous idea: Let's obey the Constitution,'"" Paul said. ""... We will go on, we will raise the money. I have no doubt about the supporters."" Of the 25 pledged delegates at stake in Iowa, CNN estimates Romney, Santorum and Paul each won seven, with Gingrich and Perry winning two. The delegate number needed to clinch the nomination is 1,144. The Iowa results typically are important because they give the top finishers the fuel they need, including fundraising, to keep their campaigns going. With Romney considered the runaway favorite in New Hampshire, some other candidates who continue past Iowa are expected to focus more on South Carolina, hoping to make a stand there. Several candidates -- Santorum, Gingrich, Perry and Bachmann -- positioned themselves as conservative alternatives to Romney. As Gingrich's popularity in Iowa fell amid withering attack ads in December, Santorum rose just in time for the caucuses. Obama, who is not expected to face a major challenge for the Democratic nomination, spoke to caucus-goers in an interactive video-teleconference to Democratic caucus sites Tuesday night. He touted the end of the war in Iraq, health care reform and making college more affordable as some of his achievements â€” a similar message to the ""promises"" campaign video rolled out this week. ""In some ways, I'm more optimistic now than I was when I first ran, because we've already seen change take place,"" Obama said in the teleconference. ""And part of what 2012 is about is reminding the American people how far we've traveled and the concrete effects that some of our work has had in terms of making sure people have health insurance and making sure our troops are coming home, or making sure people are able to go to college. ""Part of it is also framing this larger debate: What kind of country are we going to leave for our children and grandchildren?"" In addition to Perry, some other Republican candidates may now consider whether they're in position to compete in the upcoming contests. One issue to watch will be how many of their supporters latch onto the remaining non-Romney candidates, said CNN political contributor Ari Fleischer, a former White House press secretary. ""Mitt Romney doesn't want anybody to drop out,"" Fleischer said Tuesday, suggesting Romney would want to have any anti-Romney vote split as many ways as possible. ""Rick Santorum wants everybody to drop out."" Gingrich, whose popularity rose in Iowa late last year on the strength of his debate performances before the Iowa attack ads, said Tuesday night he would continue his campaign. ""I think that we are at the beginning of an extraordinarily important campaign,"" Gingrich told his supporters in Des Moines. ""The goal of the campaign has to be to replace Barack Obama, but there will be great debate in Republican Party before we are prepared to have a great debate with Barack Obama."" Bachmann, who had hoped for better in Iowa, where she grew up and finished first in a GOP straw poll in the summer before dropping in the polls, also indicate her campaign would continue. ""There will be another occupant in the White House. Who knows, maybe even another Michele in the White House,"" she told supporters Tuesday night. Before Bachmann spoke Tuesday night, CNN chief political analyst Gloria Borger said Bachmann would have to do some ""soul searching"" about whether to continue her campaign. ""She's not going to have the money to continue. She won the (GOP) straw poll in Ames in August ... She made a big point that she was born in Iowa, that this was going to be her state,"" Borger said. Huntsman, a former U.S. ambassador to China, hasn't been competing in Iowa, choosing instead to focus efforts on New Hampshire. Romney was the GOP front-runner in several major Iowa polls last week, with Paul second and Santorum third. The Iowa caucuses began at 7 p.m. Tuesday in 809 locations after months of pitches from GOP candidates vying for the chance to take on President Barack Obama in Novembe .

"New York (CNN) -- Plans to build a mosque two blocks away from ground zero have set off an emotional debate among area residents and relatives of victims of the September 11, 2001 terror attacks. Cordoba House project calls for a 15-story community center including a mosque, performance art center, gym, swimming pool and other public spaces. The project is a collaboration between the American Society for Muslim Advancement and the Cordoba Initiative, both of which work to improve relations with followers of the religion. The two groups presented their vision to part of the Community Board of lower Manhattan on Wednesday night. Ro Sheffe, a board member who attended the meeting, said the project did not need to get the board's approval. ""They own the land, and their plans don't have any zoning changes,"" Sheffe said. ""They came to us for our opinions and to let us know their plans. It was purely voluntary on their part."" The 12 members who were at the meeting voted unanimously to support the project. Community board members are appointed by the borough president and serve as advisers to the borough president and the mayor's office. Daisy Khan, executive director of the Muslim society, described her vision of a center led by Muslims, but serving the community as a whole. ""It will have a real community feel, to celebrate the pluralism in the United States, as well as in the Islamic religion,"" Khan said. ""It will also serve as a major platform for amplifying the silent voice of the majority of Muslims who have nothing to do with extremist ideologies. It will counter the extremist momentum."" The need for the center is twofold, Khan said, because it will support the needs of the growing Muslim community. ""The time for a center like this has come because Islam is an American religion,"" Khan said. ""We need to take the 9/11 tragedy and turn it into something very positive."" Sheffe said a community center for lower Manhattan residents is ""desperately needed."" The area was mostly commercial, Sheffe said, but as more people move downtown, the lack of residential amenities is a problem. The project got mixed reviews from families and friends of September 11 victims. ""I think it's the right thing to do,"" said Marvin Bethea, who was a paramedic at ground zero. ""I lost 16 friends down there. But Muslims also got killed on 9/11. It would be a good sign of faith that we're not condemning all Muslims and that the Muslims who did this happened to be extremists. As a black man, I know what it's like to be discriminated against when you haven't done anything."" Herbert Ouida, whose son was killed in the attacks, supports the project as a way to bridge cultural divide. ""I understand the anger, the bitterness and hatred, but it only generates more hatred,"" Ouida said. ""Such a large part of the world has this faith, and to say anyone who has this faith is a terrorist, it's terrible."" Others decried the idea of building a mosque so close to where their relatives died. ""Lower Manhattan should be made into a shrine for the people who died there,"" said Michael Valentin, a retired city detective who worked at ground zero. ""It breaks my heart for the families who have to put up with this. I understand they're [building] it in a respectful way, but it just shouldn't be down there."" Others such as Barry Zelman said the site's location will be a painful reminder. ""[The 9/11 terrorists] did this in the name of Islam,"" Zelman said. ""It's a sacred ground where these people died, where my brother was murdered, and to be in the shadows of that religion, it's just hypocritical and sacrilegious. "" However, Khan emphasized that the attacks killed Muslims, too. ""Three hundred of the victims were Muslim, that's 10 percent of the victims,"" she said. ""We are Americans too. The 9/11 tragedy hurt everybody including the Muslim community. We are all in this together and together we have to fight against extremism and terrorism."" Cordoba House is still in its early stages of development. The American Society for Muslim Advancement is hoping to raise funds for the center to be completed in three to five years.","Project includes 15-story community center, a mosque, performance art center .

"(Parenting.com) -- Playdates used to be as simple as, well, child's play. That's because until not so long ago, that's all they were: a couple of kids spending a couple of hours together, shooting hoops or playing a board game while Mom (natch), a homemaker (natch again), looked in from time to time, filling the snack bowl as needed. Fast-forward to today: Your kids' playmates are as likely to show up with a BlackBerry as with their baseball-card collection, and you might be driven from the neighborhood if anyone finds out you served the kids chips instead of edamame. Parenting: 10 reasons play makes kids smarter . Sending your child to someone else's home isn't exactly a worry-free experience either. Is the mom (or dad, or the sitter... hey, who's home, anyway?) so focused on Facebook that your 9-year-old and her pal are using the oven unsupervised to make s'mores? Is your middleschooler playing video games that belong to his pal's older brother -- or, geez, with a title like Mortal Evil Uprising IV, his parole officer? Be ready to navigate a few modern-day situations! Read on for the new rules to set you straight. The Sitch: Your child's old enough to stay home briefly, and often does. But is it okay to leave her and her playmate home while you dash to the dry cleaner? The Solution: Take the kids with you, or save your errand for another time, says Ava Parnass, a child and family psychotherapist in New York City. ""The other parent expects you to be there and be in charge,"" she says. ""You want to make sure that no one's feelings get too hurt if there's a squabble."" There are also safety considerations -- among them, a pal might not be as familiar with your home's setup as your own child is. Risa Miller*, of Fanwood, New Jersey, is still feeling guilty because while she was in the backyard, her daughter's 9-year-old pal decided to microwave some mac and cheese. ""She reassured my daughter that she cooked all the time at her home. But our microwave is higher up than at her house, so it's trickier to reach. The girl spilled hot pasta on her wrist and ended up with a burn that required three visits to the doctor."" The Sitch: Your daughter's playmate whips out her cell and starts texting other friends while your kid twiddles her thumbs. The Solution: ""Simply say 'Jane, since you're here on a playdate, you guys are going to play,' "" recommends Tina Paone, Ph.D., a play therapist, mother of three, and founder of Counseling Center at Heritage, in Montgomeryville, Pennsylvaniaa. As for complaining to the friend's mom later, ""I wouldn't, if the child quickly put the phone away,"" says Lisa GachÃ©, founder of Beverly Hills Manners, in California. ""But if it happens on her next visit, then at pickup, you could say to her mom, with a smile, 'Maybe next time the girls can find an activity that doesn't involve them being on the phone.' "" Parenting: Fun at-home science experiments for your next playdate . The Sitch: You feel pressured to serve only ultra-healthy foods on playdates, even though your kid prefers potato chips. The Solution: Aim for a balance, like Joan Schwartz* of Scarsdale, New York, does when her 11-year-old daughter, Hannah, has a friend over. ""I first put out something healthy, like cut-up fruit, and tell the girls they can have chips after they've finished that,"" she says. ""The other mom will know I tried to get something nutritious in them, and sometimes the kids are so full after the healthy snack that they don't ask for anything else."" The Sitch: You've accepted a sleepover invite for your daughter, not realizing that only her pal's divorced dad will be home. You're not OK with it. What to do? The Solution: ""Call and say 'I'm sorry, and this is about me and not you, but I just don't feel comfortable with a man supervising an overnighter,' "" says Paone. Offer to host the girls at your place instead, if you can, or ask to turn the sleepover into a ""late-over,"" where your daughter stays only till bedtime. In the future, always ask who'll be on duty before you say yes to a sleepover. The Sitch: You have strict TV limits at home. Is it OK to ask other parents not to allow the kids to veg out in front of the tube or video-game screen? The Solution: Either turn down playdates at houses where the TV always seems to be on or -- more sensibly -- keep your lip zipped and let your child go. ""If you make a request about the television, it will sound judgmental,"" says Paone. ""Besides, it's not like you're sending your kid over there every day, and part of letting him grow up a little is releasing some control."" If you really object, rather than saying so outright, you can hint around, like Sandra Pierce* of New York City does. ""I'll say something beforehand to the mom about how nice it is outside and how my sons really love to play football in the yard,"" she confesses. Or offer to host at your place, as Phil Corwin of Bellmore, New York, does. ""I can't dictate to other parents, but I can make them happy. Most parents are more than happy to dump their kid at your place."" Well said, Dad! Parenting: Creative, made-for-two activities for playdates . The Sitch: Your 12-year-old loves to play ""Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare"" on his Xbox. You're OK with it (you blasted plenty of ""Space Invaders"" as a tween) but you're nervous about letting his pals play, since it's rated Mature and contains violence. (Fun violence, but violence.) The Solution: Find out if the guest has the game himself. If he does, problem solved. If not, ask what his family rules are and make your decision based on that. You can always edit your kid's video titles the night before the playdate. That way, your child won't lose face when Mom heeds her own Call of Duty and confiscates the game in front of his friend. Explain why you're doing it, so he (hopefully) understands. The Sitch: You're a gay parent, but not everyone knows it. When someone asks about your wife or husband, will your answer cost your kid pals? The Solution: Mitch*, a Manhattan dad who has an 8-year-old son with his partner and runs the blog gaynycdad.com, offers a humorous response: ""I reply 'I am the wife!' The other parent can ask me more if she wants,"" he laughs. Of course, some gay parents prefer to be more circumspect. If your partner isn't around, you can just say ""I don't have a wife"" or ""My partner is at work, yes,"" says Susan Callender, an etiquette expert at the Bean City Kids program at the Boston Center for Adult Education. If your significant other will be home, though, advise the other parent in advance, she adds. Some families still may not feel comfortable letting their child come over. No one's saying that's right -- with 8 million to 10 million kids in the U.S. being raised by gay adults, that's a lot of small-minded snubbing to do -- but as parents, they have that right. You may lose their friendship, but you and your child will be fine. Parenting: Most common discipline mistakes parents make . The Sitch: A family has invited your child to go to a Justin Bieber concert with their kid. Should you pay for your kid's ticket? The Solution: If you can, offer the money, says GachÃ©. ""Do it with a big smile and say 'Thank you so much!' so they're not offended and think you're doing it because you're worried they can't afford it,"" she adds. They may insist they're treating, and that's fine. If things are tight at your house, send what you can and be sure to help your kid write a thank-you note later on. Try to host as soon as you can, too. Sharon Webb of Palm Springs, Florida, told us on Facebook that when another mom treated her son to two Disney events in two days, she watched all her kids in return. We're sure her son's mom appreciated the reciprocity (and rest!). Parenting: When you can't stand your kid's friend . Get 2 FREE YEARS of Parenting magazine - Subscribe Now!!

"(CNN) -- Five years ago, the Venezuelan government had a mystery to solve, and a Florida man who held the key to unlocking it readily offered a helping hand. President Hugo Chavez had doubts about whether the great South American hero Simon Bolivar had died of tuberculosis, as most historical accounts state, or if he had been poisoned. An eventual test came back inconclusive, but so did the status of a ""treasure trove"" of artifacts that Ricardo DeVengoechea had lent the government in its investigation. DeVengoechea is now suing Venezuela in a U.S. federal court, fighting to reclaim the valued items. When Venezuela decided to investigate Bolivar's death, a necessary step would be to confirm that the remains the government would exhume indeed belonged to the revered hero. DeVengoechea, a photographer in Orlando, could help Venezuela out with that. His ancestors were one of Colombia's founding families with ties to Bolivar, and had passed down to him a small collection worthy of a museum: a one-of-a-kind medal from a grateful Peru, signed letters and, most unique, a lock of Bolivar's hair. His collection, particularly the DNA from the hair, could confirm Bolivar's remains, and for a brief period in 2007, Venezuela treated DeVengoechea like a king. A private jet flew him and his collection to Venezuela, where government officials greeted him. For a month, he accompanied the team of researchers who examined his artifacts. When he recalled that he had more artifacts at home, the Venezuelan government promptly purchased him round-trip commercial airfare to go retrieve them. DeVengoechea returned home, and as the months turned into years, his contacts with the Venezuelans diminished, according to a lawsuit filed in a Miami court. The Florida man didn't learn about the conclusion of the tests until he read about it in the press in July 2011, the lawsuit says. The Venezuelan government had agreed to return the collection, but in late 2011, DeVengoechea found his calls going unanswered and his letters to the Venezuelan Embassy unreturned. DeVengoechea's suit says that Venezuela stole his belongings and must return the collection to him. ""Venezuela's refusal to return the DeVengoechea Collection is a clear act of expropriation of DeVengoechea's personal property in violation of international law,"" the lawsuit states. ""These items were taken from their rightful owner by the government."" The Venezuelan Embassy in Washington did not immediately comment on the suit. Bolivar gave the items in the collection to DeVengoechea's great-great-grandfather, Joaquin de Mier, the lawsuit states. In addition to the lock of hair and Liberation Medal awarded by Peru, the collection also includes epaulets from the military uniform of Napoleon Bonaparte, whom Bolivar met in France. Most historians say that tuberculosis killed Bolivar, who died in 1830 at the age of 47. In 1819, Bolivar founded Gran Colombia, a federation of what is now Venezuela, Colombia, Panama and Ecuador. He is credited with spreading democratic principles in Latin America. The exhumation was broadcast on television, and Chavez admitted to crying as the remains were recovered. ""Bolivar is alive. Let us not see him as a dead man and let us not see him as a skeleton. He is like lightning, like a sacred fire,"" he said then. With the national anthem playing in the background, a group of scientists wearing white coats rolled up a black cloth, revealing a skeleton on the table below.","Ricardo DeVengoechea provided artifacts that helped a Venezuelan investigation .

"Washington (CNN) -- Newt Gingrich left the Republican presidential campaign with a mixed legacy and a campaign deep in debt. The former speaker was left for political dead last year after his top campaign advisers quit over a disagreement on the direction of the campaign and its financial structure. But he came roaring back in late 2011 -- due in part to a Republican electorate that was not sold on Mitt Romney's candidacy. It is the past few months, though, for which he may be most remembered -- for staying in the race for too long, rather than for the big ideas he espoused on the campaign trail. ""He has not made a good case for his name after this primary is over,"" said Ari Fleischer, a CNN contributor who served as President George W. Bush's spokesman. ""And that's a shame, because Newt's done a lot for the Republican Party, but graciousness is part of politics. You just have to know when your time has come to walk off the stage."" For most, that time would have been after his Southern strategy failed, when he failed to win the Alabama and Mississippi primaries after coming out on top of the South Carolina and Georgia primaries. On Wednesday, Gingrich suspended his campaign and pledged to be an ""active citizen"" and to continue to work on behalf of ""American exceptionalism,"" energy independence and health care reform. In throwing his support to Romney, Gingrich seemed to put aside differences he and other conservatives have with the presumptive nominee and look instead to the general election. ""You know, this is not a choice between Mitt Romney and Ronald Reagan, this is a choice between Mitt Romney and the most radical leftist president in American history,"" Gingrich said. After limping along for weeks, Gingrich's campaign ended last week after a disappointing last stand in Delaware, one of five states that went for Romney that day. Campaign sources said a day later that Gingrich would end his campaign this week. Ron Brownstein, editorial director of National Journal and a CNN contributor, said the campaign's impact on Gingrich's legacy will be mixed. ""On the one hand, his ascent was a reminder that he remains one of the most skilled provocateurs in American politics. The fact that he was able to emerge as a serious contender, more than a decade after he last was a major player in Republican politics, was a testament to his skill at framing issues and shaping debate,"" Brownstein said. ""On the other hand, the campaign was also a reminder of Gingrich's weakness, including a self-confidence that tips over into hubris and a lack of discipline. And while Gingrich reaffirmed his identity as a politician who believes in big ideas, that image is more lasting than any of the specific ideas he proposed."" Little of Gingrich's agenda will be part of the Republican campaign going forward, Brownstein said. ""He wanted colonizing the moon to be a symbol of thinking big and outside the box; instead it became a symbol of grandiosity and impractical thinking. After this campaign, as before it, Gingrich will always symbolize some of both."" Campaign on the rocks early . Gingrich formally announced his bid for the nomination last May, only to see it almost crash the next month when a half-dozen staffers, including the senior leadership, left the campaign. Among the gripes from the departed staffers was that it was difficult to schedule campaign events or spend the time needed to raise money to fuel the campaign. In addition, there were complaints that Gingrich's wife, Callista, had veto power over all scheduling requests. While his staffers felt Gingrich should be hitting the trail, he and Callista embarked on a two-week luxury cruise in the Mediterranean that for some in the campaign was the last straw. Two of Gingrich's top staffers with ties to Texas Gov. Rick Perry bolted for the Perry campaign in June, and Gingrich's campaign was presumed dead just as it was getting started. His campaign languished over the summer and into the fall as conservatives test-drove a series of anyone-but-Romney candidates: first Michele Bachmann, then Rick Perry, then Herman Cain. As his rivals rose and fell, Gingrich turned in strong performances in GOP debates -- which earned him a second look from those who were longing for an alternative to Romney, whose conservative convictions they questioned. By December, polls had made Gingrich the front-runner with a double-digit lead over Romney. But Romney, his supporters and Gingrich opponents went on the attack -- calling his consulting firm's work for the conservative-despised federal mortgage giant Freddie Mac ""lobbying"" and re-airing dirty laundry from his previous four decades in government. After lackluster showings in Iowa and New Hampshire, Gingrich made a stand in friendlier South Carolina, with the help of a super PAC funded by casino magnate Shel Adelson which went on the attack against Romney. Gingrich scored a double-digit win. That was arguably Gingrich's high-water mark. Florida results stop momentum . Romney's better-funded campaign, aided by friendly super PACs, crushed Gingrich in Florida and stopped his momentum. Gingrich focused his campaign on the South and Super Tuesday. He won Georgia, which he represented in Congress for 20 years, but he couldn't pick up Tennessee. He went on to lose Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana, which all went to Rick Santorum. As Gingrich and Santorum continued to split the conservative vote, calls got louder for the former speaker to drop out and make it a two-man race between Santorum and Romney. Hearing the calls, Gingrich instead suggested that Santorum drop out and questioned the former Pennsylvania senator's qualifications. And then as Santorum surged, Gingrich suggested that he and Santorum form an alliance to ""tag-team"" Romney and derail his run to the nomination. Despite all this, Gingrich did accomplish something few have, Brownstein said. ""With this campaign, Gingrich established himself as someone who has been a serious force in Republican politics in five different decades, a pretty remarkable accomplishment."" Gingrich's five decades in government began when the then-college professor was elected to Congress in the late 1970s. He rode the Republican Contract with America into the speaker's chair in the mid 1990s -- a pledge to the American people to institute sweeping changes if the GOP took over the majority in Congress. When Republicans took over the House in 1994 -- the first time in four decades -- Gingrich was chosen as the new speaker. Gingrich challenged President Bill Clinton's White House as congressional Republicans pushed government cuts to help balance the budget. Both sides dug in and there were two government shutdowns -- but the shutdowns backfired on Gingrich, and Republicans came out the political losers. Gingrich led efforts to impeach Clinton over an investigation of his infidelities with White House intern Monica Lewinsky, but Clinton was acquitted. It was later revealed the Gingrich was having an affair with a congressional staffer as he was leading the charge against Clinton. Dogged by ethics questions . He was also dogged by ethics issues brought by Democrats. He voluntarily turned in a $4.5 million book advance after critics questioned its appropriateness. And in 1997, Gingrich agreed to pay $300,000 to the House to reimburse the cost of an investigation into whether he used tax-exempt funds to promote Republican causes. He was not found guilty of those charges, but was reprimanded by the House for giving what was considered misleading information. Republicans kept control of the House for a third consecutive term in the 1998 elections, but won fewer seats than expected. Gingrich took the fall. He resigned as speaker and left Congress the next year. Over the next decade, Gingrich mounted a comeback, expounding on the lecture circuit and through think tanks on how to reform government and society -- ranging from creating a new Social Security system based on what a person contributes, to completely revamping the country's energy policy, to replacing the Environmental Protection Agency with a new Environmental Solutions Agency. He was also a prolific fundraiser for conservative candidates and causes. His visibility was elevated when he joined Fox News as a contributor, which gave him a national platform to comment on the events of the day and promote a number of books he has written on subjects ranging from the American political scene to Ronald Reagan. His Fox contract was suspended when he announced his bid for the White House. Gingrich leaves the trail with his campaign $4.3 million in debt, according to Federal Election Commission filings. A Republican strategist said that Gingrich's run reflected how badly the party wanted a big thinker in the White House. ""Republicans wanted an ideas guy like Newt Gingrich to be president so badly that at times we even turned to Newt Gingrich, a fatally flawed candidate,"" said Alex Castellanos, a CNN contributor who advised Romney's campaign in 2008. Castellanos sees Gingrich's legacy as like Moses': ""He helped lead his party to the promised land, but he didn't get there himself.""

"(CNN) -- The Boston-area man who planned to kidnap children, rape and eat them is awaiting sentencing Tuesday and is seeking a prison term of 18 years followed by lifetime supervised release, according to court documents. Geoffrey Portway, 40, who pleaded guilty in May to distribution and possession of child pornography and solicitation to commit a crime of violence, submitted a document through his attorney to Massachusetts District Court on Friday, providing information to be used in imposing a sentence ""sufficient but not greater than necessary,"" the court document says. The document includes background on the case, cites similar cases, and reasons for why Portway agrees to a term of 18 years, with a maximum of 21 years and 10 months. Such reasons included the contention that he ""never engaged in inappropriate sexual conduct with a minor,"" that Portway will be required to register as a sex offender upon his release, limiting his future employment options, and there was ""no evidence that (Portway) ever acted out any of his fantasies."" Portway, a former computer operator, also agreed to pay $10,000 in restitution fees. Ex-PTA president accused of making child porn at elementary school . Federal authorities are recommending that he go to prison for at least 27 years, according to other court documents filed last week. ""Portway has pled guilty to some of the most vile and heinous crimes known to our society,"" federal prosecutors wrote in a sentencing recommendation. But a lawyer for the 40-year-old defendant told CNN his client ""lived in a fantasy world"" and there was no evidence he harmed any child. 'Cannibal cop' convicted in New York . After his arrest, Portway underwent mental health evaluations requested by his attorney, who referred him to a clinical and forensic psychologist who assessed Portway's ""risk for re-offending and the degree of danger he posed to the community,"" according to court-filed mental health evaluation documents. The documents describe a troubled childhood. His parents divorced when he was young, and Portman realized he was gay when he was 8 years old but was afraid to reveal it because his father was homophobic, the evaluating psychologist Dr. Eric L. Brown, wrote. Around the same time, according to the evaluation, he became increasingly fascinated with children's tales such as ""Hansel and Gretel,"" in which two children are caged and fattened up so that a witch can eat them. Pretzel bag leads feds to child porn suspect in California . Portway had a ""wish to be eaten"" that ""fulfilled a more basic desire to be wanted, valued, and incorporated by another person,"" wrote Dr. Brown. When Portway's home in Worcester was searched last year, authorities found tens of thousands of computer images and videos of child pornography and 4,500 exchanges of child pornography between Portway and the people he chatted with online. The images included children purportedly being cooked and prepared to be eaten, court documents said. Those photographs are sealed. Authorities also found a locked basement, court documents show. Photos taken the day of Portway's arrest, and released by prosecutors, show a narrow wooden staircase leading downstairs to a soundproof room. It was furnished with a metal cage with a circular hole for feeding, a rusted and worn steel-topped table, as well as multiple kinds of metal bondage equipment. A child-sized coffin made of plywood was found on the floor nearby. Smartphone app hunts for child predators . Portway's lawyer, Richard J. Sweeney, told CNN that his client's sentencing hearing will be ""the proper time to address all the issues addressed by the government."" But he added, ""There's no evidence at all of Geoffrey being involved with any child or harming any child."" ""Geoffrey lived in a fantasy world where he did live-action role playing, did things online unrelated to child porn and cannibalism. A lot of the chats that he had were, in his mind, fantasy,"" Sweeney said. ""When they went out to the other people he was talking to, these other people actually had kids they were taking photos of. Geoffrey did not have any kids he had abducted, though he certainly talked about it."" Photographs reviewed by CNN show handcuffs, rope intended for bondage, bleach, disposable scalpels and syringes, mouth gags, a butcher kit with multiple knives, a child-sized red ""onesie,"" and castration tools. His DVD collection, documents show, included titles such as ""Hansel and Gretel,"" ""The Real Cannibal Holocaust,"" ""The Genesis Children,"" and ""Cannibal Ferox,"" a film with the tagline ""Make them die slowly."" Online chats, seized by police, showed Portway called his basement a ""dungeon"" where he intended to ""keep kidnapped children while he sexually abused them and as a place to eventually murder and cannibalize the children.""

CNN's Deborah Feyerick, Rande Iaboni, Lateef Mungin, Julie Cannold, and Ronni Berke contributed to this report.","Geoffrey Portway pleaded guilty in May to child porn and solicitation to commit violence .
