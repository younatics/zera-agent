"An innovative hotel shaped like a giant pearl could soon be floating on the waters off the Gold Coast. The Sea Pearl Hotel, the creation of Professor Jianping Zheng, will feature 300 rooms, a casino and an underwater restaurant. Mr Zheng believes the Broadwater in the Gold Coast as a 'perfect' location for his $250million development, which he hopes will become one of Australia's iconic landmarks - much like the Sydney Opera House. Chinese architect Professor Jianping Zheng has designed the Sea Pearl Hotel (pictured) which he hopes to develop in the Gold Coast, southeastern Queensland . The floating hotel, which will cost about $250million, will feature 300 rooms, a casino and an underwater restaurant . The professor of Zhejiang University, in Hangzhou which is southwest of Shanghai, visited Australia as part of the Australia China Chamber of CEO's G20 lead up event - the inaugural Intelligent Green 20 Forum. Also known as the iG20, the forum was also in collaboration with the Brisbane Global Cafe on November 12 and 13 to discuss sustainable technologies and practices for economic benefits. This is when Mr Zheng, who's developed more than 200 theme parks and hotels in China such as the Sheraton Moon Hotel, unveiled his vision for the Gold Coast Integrated Resort and Cruise Ship Terminal in southeastern Queensland - the proposed home for the Sea Pearl Hotel. The spokesman for Marie Stephens Properties, the developers of the floating hotel, told Daily Mail Australia Mr Zheng hopes his futuristic designs 'make a statement as big as the Opera House did for Sydney'. Mr Zheng has developed more than 200 theme parks and hotels in China such as the Sheraton Moon Hotel  in Huzhou . Mr Zheng is renouned for his innovative designs, including the 'Insect Hall' which is known as the world’s largest insect museum . The professor also designed the Forest Tourism Complex - China's first open travel shopping mall . Shane Reynolds, who says the development of the hotel will cost about $250million, added Mr Zheng believes the proposed cruise ship terminal is a 'perfect' location for his hotel. Professor of Zhejiang University, Jianping Zheng . The hotel will also feature shopping malls, a sky viewing deck, night light entertainment, a swimming pool, restaurants, presidential suites pods next to the main landmark and an exhibition centre. However the mayor of Gold Coast Council, Tom Tate, told Daily Mail Australia the hotel isn't a new concept and no formal proposal has been put forward to the council. 'I have only heard about and seen the project through the newspaper,' he said. 'I understand the design concept is about six years old and not originally for the Broadwater. 'There is little else to add as the proponent has not approached council.' Despite this, the executive of Marie Stephens Properties says their brief discussion about the project with Queensland Premier Campbell Newman on Wednesday was met with a positive response. Marie Stephens says the company will be travelling to China next week to meet with Mr Zheng, who left for China on Sunday, 'to discuss the planning and approval process for the proposed development'.","Chinese architect Professor Jianping Zheng has designed the Sea Pearl Hotel .

"Along with the hoverboard and time travelling Delorean, self-tying shoelaces were an iconic invention featured in the Back To The Future film franchise. Now they have become a reality and you can even buy a pair for $175CAD (£99). Inventors in St Hubert, Canada, have created a pair of trainers where the laces automatically tighten when a wearer slips their feet inside. Scroll down for video . Inventors in St Hubert, Canada, have created a pair of trainers where the laces automatically tighten when a wearer slips their feet inside. The mechanisms of the shoes are shown in these images . They claim that the ‘Powerlace auto-lacing system’ lets people tie their laces without using their hands when their weight automatically engages the system’s mechanism. A small lever at the lower rear end of the shoe activates the system so that the energy needed to tie the shoelaces comes from the weight of the wearer’s body. During Back To The Future II, Marty McFly, played by Michael J. Fox, puts on a pair of Nike High Tops that automatically tighten and adjust to fit his feet - using so-called power laces. During Back To The Future II, Marty McFly, played by Michael J. Fox, puts on a pair of Nike High Tops that automatically tighten and adjust to fit his feet - using so-called power laces . Much loved: Michael J. Fox starred in 1985's Back to the Future - the first of three films starring the actor and Christopher Lloyd. There self-typing laces features alongside the time travelling Delorean (pictured) The laces automatically on the trainers tighten when a wearer slips their feet inside them. A ‘presser’ that’s hidden in the sole of the shoes, transmits power when a wearer steps on them to the lacing mechanism. Their weight pulls the laces tight and the maximum amount of tension can be manually adjusted using a ‘lace lock’. To loosen the trainers, wearers have to pull a small 'lever' on the back of the shoe. Nike also plans on selling power laces next year, according to designer Tinker Hatfield, which will be the same year in which the much loved film is set. Speaking at the Jordan Brand Flight Lab in New Orleans in February, he told Sole Collector: 'Are we gonna see power laces in 2015? To that, I say yes!' While the Powerlace system may not look as dynamic as Marty McFly’s in the film, the inventors claim that their adjustable tension design system guarantees the best fit and comfort every time. The shoes contain hidden components that allow the laces to tighten automatically, including the 'presser,' which is concealed in the shoe's sole in the heel area. The inventors of the shoes claim that the ‘Powerlace auto-lacing system’ lets people tie their laces without using their hands when their weight automatically engages the system’s mechanism via the  'presser' (pictured) which is concealed in the shoe's sole in the heel area . The 'puller' (pictured) provides the connection between the tension applied by the mechanism and the direct pressure applied by the lacing. The laces are designed to support tension exceeding 250lbs . 'The presser serves as a force sensor and transmits this power directly to the lacing mechanism using a very clever, but subtle process,' according to the Kickstarter website. The sole of the shoe also conceals the lever and is made from thermo polyurethane to be flexible and absorb stress. 'The puller' provides the connection between the tension applied by the mechanism and the direct pressure applied by the lacing. Made from nylon, the laces are designed to support tension exceeding 250lbs (113kg) and a 'lace lock' enables a wearer to decide how tight they like their shoes to be. To loosen the trainers, wearers have to pull a small lever on the back of the shoe. The auto-lacing shoes are available to order via Kickstarter for $175 CAD (£99) and will ship in May 2015, providing the company raises enough cash to put them into production. Nike plans on selling power laces next year, according to designer Tinker Hatfield, which will be the same year in which the much loved film is set. Speaking at the Jordan Brand Flight Lab in New Orleans in February, he told Sole Collector: 'Are we gonna see power laces in 2015? To that, I say yes!' Rumours about the technology have been circling since 2010 when Nike applied for a patent for 'automatically lacing trainers.' It said: 'The automatic lacing system provides a set of straps that can be automatically opened and closed to switch between a loosened and tightened position of the upper. The company released a limited range of McFly's Nike MAGs with manual laces in 2011. Only 1,500 models of the High Tops were made, and every pair was auctioned off on eBay. A total of $6million (£3.5million) was raised from the sales of these shoes, and all the proceeds went to the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research. Nike also plans on selling power laces next year, according to designer Tinker Hatfield, which will be the same year in which the much loved film is set Rumours about the technology have been circling since 2010, after which Nike released a range of Back To The Future-inspired High Tops, (pictured)","Inventors in St Hubert, Canada, made the trainers that lace automatically .

"It is the quirky new fitness craze that swept fitness studios across America at the start of last year. Finding popularity in the UK and Europe too, it is the newest yoga trend on the block - and its health benefits come highly rated. And now, AntiGravity Yoga has found itself a very famous fan in the form of Gwyneth Paltrow. The athletic actress has written a rave review of the practice on her blog and, if her svelte figure is anything to go by, it is working a treat. Famous fan: Athletic Gwyneth Paltrow wrote about her enjoyable experience of aerial yoga . AntiGravity Yoga, the brainchild of . acrobat and gymnast Christopher Harrison, involves a thorough workout a . few feet above the ground in a silk hammock that can close around the . person inside to form a peaceful pod. New . classes first launched around the USA and franchises have been set . up in Ireland and Italy and the UK. Speaking about her experience, 40-year-old Gwyneth wrote: 'We spent an afternoon in Richard Holroyd’s intimate studio that houses four AntiGravity Hammocks - basically a hammock made of silk that you can lie, hang, stretch in and more. Cocoon craze: Closing yourself off inside the hammock allows you to focus on your mind, body and spirit and Gwyneth Paltrow is a huge fan . 'At first, we just got used to being in the swing - part of what makes it so special is the sense of suspension. 'Then Richard showed us several moves with the hammock. In comparison to other yoga classes, the moves felt constructive without feeling like a chore.' Founder Christopher came up with the system while playing with hammocks on an Indian retreat in 1996. He continued to study yoga and . invented apparatus for his dance troupe using flying silk to help them . exercise and prepare for acrobatic displays. Christopher, 50, said: 'I'd been travelling all over the world performing and had put a lot of strain on my body. Newfangled dangle: Christopher Harrison's yoga class really took off in New York . 'But we discovered that hanging upside down in the hammocks helped to get all the kinks out. 'We put hammocks in our practice room and used them as part of our warm up. 'It was not only a beautiful apparatus for flying, but a great way to decompress our spine after long flights. 'The combination of yoga and the silk hammock was inevitable.' Less of a strain: The hammock helps take the weight off the spine and joints. Christopher Harrison developed his system after struggling to perform yoga poses on the ground because of wrist problems . Christopher struggled with yoga poses on the ground because of wrist problems but found his practice much more successful in the air. 'Using the hammock wasn't challenging on my wrists,' he said. 'I put one in my house, and me and my friends would find ourselves hanging around in it. Fitness fan: Gwyneth is a big fan of keeping fit . 'Inside the hammock, you close off everything around you and have awareness of mind, body and spirit. 'My mother wanted to exercise but she struggled because of a back problem. 'But she tried AntiGravity yoga and was successful.' He developed the system over the next ten years and now runs yoga classes 17 times a week from a Manhattan studio. 'AntiGravity Yoga has become so popular that there are already similar classes springing up in England,' said Christopher. 'We'd like people to come to a real AntiGravity class and find out about the original.' Hanging . upside down refreshes the body's systems, helps blood flow, and allows . everyone to try postures such as the headstand and handstand, he added.

"It was a devastating inferno which engulfed one of Britain’s finest buildings and destroyed a world famous educational facility. But six months after a devastating blaze ripped through the Mackintosh Library at the Glasgow School of Art, fresh attempts are being made to recover some of its treasured contents. Many items were lost forever when the library went up in flames in May as students were making last-minute adjustments to their final-year degree show work. Scroll down for video . Destroyed: Forensic archaeologist Owen Godbert begins the task of sifting through the ashes of the fire-damaged Mackintosh Library at the Glasgow School of Art . Restoration: An expert exams part of a wooden doorway salvaged from the burnt-out rubble in the interior of the historic building . Burnt out: Experts have started the painstaking task of examining the the charred remains of the library - and picking out anything capable of being restored . But today, forensic archaeologists began the painstaking task of sifting through the ashes of the fire-damaged library in the hope of rescuing books, furniture and other artefacts. The work is being undertaken by Kirkdale Archaeology as part of a wider restoration project that is expected to cost £20million. The BBC quoted Alison Stevenson, head of libraries, archives and collections at the Glasgow School of Art as saying: 'Immediately after the fire, with support from Historic Scotland, the GSA was able to remove substantial amounts of material from the Mackintosh Building. 'We are now turning to what is at once the most complex and potentially most revealing project in terms of conservation. 'Although the library was destroyed in the fire there are significant remains which we hope will retain artefacts or fragments that will prove invaluable both in terms of our archival records and our restoration plans.' The Grade I listed Mackintosh Building, founded 175 years ago, in Scotland Street, Glasgow, was significantly damaged in the blaze. But after dozens of fire fighters descended on the scene, the blaze was brought under control enabling many items to be rescued. Miraculously there were no casualties in the fire.

A vast number of items were lost forever when the library went up in flames in May as students were making last-minute adjustments to their final-year degree show work . At the time it was reported that the blaze may have started in the basement of the building. Earlier this year, hundreds of thousands of pounds in charitable donations were raised to help restore the Glasgow School of Art and its fire damaged library. The Hugh Fraser Foundation, a long-term supporter of the school, pledged £300,000 while the Cameron Mackintosh Foundation, which supports art projects, committed £250,000. It added to a UK Government pledge of £5million and a Scottish Government commitment to match funds up to £5million to support the restoration. It is thought it will cost £20million to properly restore the renowned Grade A-listed building. Around 10 per cent of the structure of the building, including the unique library, was destroyed in the blaze. The Grade I listed Glasgow School of Arts building, founded 175 years ago, in Scotland Street, Glasgow, was significantly damaged in the inferno in May this year . Experts plan to excavate the burnt out remains layer by layer as they look to salvage items that can eventually help in the restoration project . The fire broke out as Glasgow School of Arts students were making last-minute adjustments to their final-year degree . Earlier this year, hundreds of thousands of pounds were raised through cahritable donations to help restore the Glasgow School of Art and its fire damaged library . Writer Muriel Gray, chairwoman of Glasgow School of Art, said she hoped to see a library in operation in four years. The School of Art has produced a host of famous alumni across the creative fields over the past 165 years. As well as renowned artists, former students include members of the bands Travis and Franz Ferdinand, and actors Peter Capaldi and Robbie Coltrane. Several winners of the prestigious Turner Prize studied at Glasgow School of Art (GSA), including Martin Boyce, who scooped the prize in 2011 for his installation Do Words Have Voices, beating what critics felt was the strongest shortlist for many years. Graduate Douglas Gordon took the prize in 1996 while it was won by Richard Wright in 2009. Simon Starling also picked up the accolade in 2005. Dozens of fire fighters descended on the scene and used aerial ladders and hose reels to try and dampen the flames . Inferno: At the time it was reported that the blaze may have started in the basement of the 175-year-old building before spreading to other floors . The ornate interior of the building featured spectacular mahogany beams and wall cladding (pictured) featuring geometric art nouveau motifs . As well as being a celebrated art school, Charles Rennie Mackintosh's building was listed and was a tourist attraction in its own right . This year three out of the four candidates for the UK's best-known art award - worth £25,000 - studied at the school. As well as being a celebrated art school, Charles Rennie Mackintosh's building was listed and was a tourist attraction in its own right. Construction work started on the building in 1897 after Mackintosh won a design competition while working for Glasgow architects Honeyman and Keppie. Widely regarded as his best work, the long E shaped Rennie Mackintosh school was voted as the best building in the last 175 years in a survey for the Royal Institute of British Architects. The first half of the building was completed in 1899, but the art nouveau design in the Gatehill area took another 12 years to finish.","Mackintosh Library at the Glasgow School of Art was destroyed when fire broke out in the basement of the building .

"Women who take the contraceptive pill for more than three years are twice as likely to suffer from an eye condition that can lead to blindness . Women who take the contraceptive pill for more than three years are twice as likely to suffer from an eye condition that can lead to blindness, a new study has found. The research revealed women who take the pill are more likely to develop glaucoma. The condition occurs when the drainage tubes within the eyes become blocked, preventing fluid from draining properly and causing pressure to build up, damaging the optic nerve and nerves from the retina. In England alone around 480,000 people have the most common form of glaucoma, which is most often seen in white Europeans. The new study is the first to establish an increased risk of glaucoma in women who have used oral contraceptives. Scientists have now urged gynaecologists and ophthalmologists to tell women of the increased risk and to screen for the condition. The eye damage caused by glaucoma cannot be reversed but prompt treatment will halt the progression of the condition. Dr Shan Lin of the University of California in San Francisco said: ‘This study should be an impetus for future research to prove the cause and effect of oral contraceptives and glaucoma. ‘At this point, women who have taken oral contraceptives for three or more years should be screened for glaucoma and followed closely by an ophthalmologist.’ The researchers used data from 2005 to 2008 in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. This included 3,406 female participants aged 40 years or older from across the U.S. who completed the survey’s vision and reproductive health questionnaire and underwent eye examinations. It found women who had used oral contraceptives, no matter which kind, for longer than three years were 2.05 times more likely to also report that they had been diagnosed with glaucoma. Although there was no direct causative effect of oral contraceptives on the development of glaucoma, it indicates that long-term use of oral contraceptives might be a potential risk factor for glaucoma. Previous studies have shown that oestrogen may play a significant role in the development of glaucoma. Women who take the pill are more likely to develop glaucoma - a condition that occurs when the drainage tubes in the eyes become blocked, preventing fluid from draining properly and causing pressure to build up damaging the optic nerve and nerves from the retina . The finding was presented at the 117th Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Ophthalmology in New Orleans. About one in 50 white Europeans over the age of 40 have glaucoma, as do one in 10 people over the age of 75. The most common form of glaucoma - chronic open-angle glaucoma - progresses very slowly and often does not cause any noticeable symptoms. However, over time the patient will start to lose vision from the outer rim of their eye. The loss of vision will slowly move inwards towards the centre of the eye. Glaucoma is a term that describes a group of eye conditions that affect vision. It usually affects both eyes but in varying degrees. It occurs when the drainage tubes within the eye become blocked. This prevents eye fluid from draining properly. When the fluid cannot drain, pressure builds up. This can damage the optic nerve and nerve fibres from the retina. There are four main types of glaucoma - the most common is chronic open-angle glaucoma. This develops very slowly. The other types are rarer but tend to be more severe. The condition can be treated with eye drops, laser treatment or surgery. However, early diagnosis is important because any damage to the eyes cannot be reversed. If left untreated, glaucoma can cause visual impairment. Glaucoma affects about 480,000 people in England alone. Chronic open-angle glaucoma is most common among white Europeans.

"Goats are shrinking as a result of climate change, researchers have claimed. They say Alpine goats now weigh about 25 per cent less than animals of the same age in the 1980s. Researchers say it is a stark indication of how quickly climate change can affect animals. The Alpine chamois goats now weigh about 25 per cent less than animals of the same age in the 1980s. The chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) is a goat-antelope species found in the mountains of Romania, the Pyrenees, the European Alps, the Tatra Mountains, the Balkans, parts of Turkey, and the Caucasus. It has also been introduced to the South Island of New Zealand. Chamois leather, traditionally made from the hide of the chamois, is very smooth and absorbent and is favoured in cleaning, buffing, and polishing because it produces no scratching. They are known for their amazing escapology. When alarmed, chamois speed to the most inaccessible places, making leaps as high as 2 meters and spanning as much as 6 meters. Extremely nimble and surefooted, the chamois can travel up to 50 kmph over steep or uneven ground. Alarm signals include whistling through the nose, 'sneezing', and stamping their feet. They appear to be shrinking in size as they react to changes in climate, according to new research from Durham University. The researchers studied the impacts of changes in temperature on the body size of Alpine Chamois, a species of mountain goat, over the past 30 years. To their surprise, they discovered that young Chamois now weigh about 25 per cent less than animals of the same age in the 1980s. In recent years, decreases in body size have been identified in a variety of animal species, and have frequently been linked to the changing climate. However, the researchers say the decline in size of Chamois observed in this study is striking in its speed and magnitude. The research, funded by the Natural Environment Research Council is published in the journal Frontiers in Zoology. Lead author Dr Tom Mason, in the School of Biological and Biomedical Sciences, at Durham University, said: 'Body size declines attributed to climate change are widespread in the animal kingdom, with many fish, bird and mammal species getting smaller. 'However the decreases we observe here are astonishing. 'The impacts on Chamois weight could pose real problems for the survival of these populations.' The team delved into long-term records of Chamois body weights provided by hunters in the Italian Alps. They discovered that the declines were strongly linked to the warming climate in the study region, which became 3-4oC warmer during the 30 years of the study. The team believes that higher temperatures are affecting how chamois behave. 'We know that Chamois cope with hot periods by resting more and spending less time searching for food, and this may be restricting their size more than the quality of the vegetation they eat,' said Co-author Dr Stephen Willis. 'If climate change results in similar behavioural and body mass changes in domestic livestock, this could have impacts on agricultural productivity in coming decades.' According to the authors, the future plight of the Chamois remains unclear. Ajuvenile Alpine Chamois in the Italian Alps. The research suggests that declining body size is a result of changes in both climate and the density of animals. Dr Philip Stephens, another co-author on the study, in the School of Biological and Biomedical Sciences, at Durham University, said: 'The body mass of juvenile animals is critical to their ability to survive harsh winters. 'However, whether that becomes a problem will depend on the balance of future climate change between the seasons.' The research suggests that declining body size is a result of changes in both climate and the density of animals. To counter declining body size in future, the researchers say it might be necessary to maintain Chamois populations at lower densities than occur at present, perhaps through changes in hunting regulations. Dr Mason added: 'This study shows the striking, unforeseen impacts that climate change can have on animal populations. 'It is vital that we continue to study how climate change affects species such as Chamois. 'Changes in body size could act as early-warning systems for worse impacts to come, such as the collapses of populations.'","Alpine goats now weigh about 25 per cent less than animals of the same age in the 1980s .

"The mother of Brittany Maynard has hit back at the Vatican's criticism of her daughter's decision to end her life early rather than suffer with terminal brain cancer. Just days after Maynard's  death last month, the Vatican's top bioethics official called her choice 'reprehensible' and said physician-assisted suicide should be condemned and said it was 'reprehensible.' But now Maynard's mother, Debbie Ziegler, issued a sharp written response Tuesday, saying the Vatican official's comments came as the family was grieving and were 'more than a slap in the face.' Scroll down for video Debbie ZieglerDebbie Ziegler . Debbie Ziegler, the mother of Brittany Maynard (both pictured) has hit back at the Vatican's criticism of her daughter's decision to end her life early rather than suffer with terminal brain cancer . Criticism:  Monsignor Ignacio Carrasco de Paula (left), head of the Pontifical Academy for Life,  condemned Maynard's (right) decision to end her own life . Her response was made through Compassion & Choices, an advocacy group that Maynard worked with. She also cricitizes the choice of words used to describe her daughter in the statement: 'My twenty-nine-year-old daughter's choice to die gently rather than suffer physical and mental degradation and intense pain does not deserve to be labelled as reprehensible by strangers a continent away who do not know her or the particulars of her situation. 'Reprehensible is a harsh word. It means: 'very bad; deserving very strong criticism.' Reprehensible is a word I've used as a teacher to describe the actions of Hitler, other political tyrants and the exploitation of children by pedophiles. ' Tearful: Brittany wept in a video days before she passed away in Portland, Oregon, surrounded by her family . Maynard's mother, Debbie Ziegler, pictured with her daughter . I am Brittany Maynard's mother. I am writing in response to a variety of comments made in the press and online by individuals and institutions that have tried to impose their personal belief system on what Brittany and our family feel is a human rights issue. The imposition of 'belief' on a human rights issue is wrong. To censure a personal choice as reprehensible because it does not comply with someone else's belief is immoral. My twenty-nine-year-old daughter's choice to die gently rather than suffer physical and mental degradation and intense pain does not deserve to be labelled as reprehensible by strangers a continent away who do not know her or the particulars of her situation. Reprehensible is a harsh word. It means: 'very bad; deserving very strong criticism.' Reprehensible is a word I've used as a teacher to describe the actions of Hitler, other political tyrants and the exploitation of children by pedophiles. As Brittany Maynard's mother, I find it difficult to believe that anyone who knew her would ever select this word to describe her actions. Brittany was a giver. She was a volunteer. She was a teacher. She was an advocate. She worked at making the world a better place to live. This word was used publicly at a time when my family was tender and freshly wounded. Grieving. Such strong public criticism from people we do not know, have never met – is more than a slap in the face. It is like kicking us as we struggle to draw a breath. People and institutions that feel they have the right to judge Brittany's choices may wound me and cause me unspeakable pain but they do not deter me from supporting my daughter's choice. There is currently a great deal of confusion and arrogance standing in the way of Americans going gently into the good night. I urge Americans to think for themselves. Make your wishes clear while you are competent. Make sure that you have all the options spelled out for you if you are diagnosed with an incurable, debilitating, painful disease. Do your own research. Ask your family to research and face the harsh reality with you. Ask your doctor to be brutally honest with you. Then make your personal choice about how you will proceed. It is YOUR choice. The 'culture of cure' has led to a fairy tale belief that doctors can always fix our problems. We have lost sight of reality. All life ends. Death is not necessarily the enemy in all cases. Sometimes a gentle passing is a gift. Misguided doctors caught up in an aspirational belief that they must extend life, whatever the cost, cause individuals and families unnecessary suffering. Brittany stood up to bullies. She never thought anyone else had the right to tell her how long she should suffer. The right to die for the terminally ill is a human rights issue. Plain and simple. Debbie Ziegler . Brittany's Momma . 'As Brittany Maynard's mother, I find it difficult to believe that anyone who knew her would ever select this word to describe her actions. Monsignor Ignacio Carrasco de Paula, head of the Pontifical Academy for Life, made the remarks just two days after Miss Maynard, 29, took a lethal prescription of drugs at her Oregon home. Speaking to Italian news agency Ansa, he said: 'This woman (took her own life) thinking she would die with dignity, but this is the error. Suicide is not a good thing. 'It is a bad thing because it is saying no to life and to everything it means with respect to our mission in the world and towards those around us.' Monsignor Carrasco de Paula, whose Academy is responsible for ethical issues in the Catholic Church, even went so far as to describe assisted suicide, in itself, as a reprehensible 'absurdity'. He added: 'Dignity is something different to putting an end to your own life.' The Roman Catholic Church opposes euthanasia and assisted suicide, teaching that life starts at the moment of conception and should end at the moment of natural death. Ms Maynard was diagnosed in January with stage IV glioblastoma multiforme, an aggressive form of terminal brain cancer. In April, doctors gave her just six months to live. Grief-stricken: Mr Diaz (pictured during an interview with People.com) described his late wife as 'beautiful' Connection: Mr Diaz and Ms Maynard are seen on their wedding day at Beltane Ranch, California, in 2012 . She hit headlines around the world and became the face of the right-to-die movement after revealing her plans to end her own life under Oregon's Death with Dignity Act. She passed away in the arms of her husband, Dan Diaz, and surrounded by friends and family in her home in Portland. On the day of her death, she posted an emotional message to her loved ones and supporters via Facebook according to People. It read:  'Goodbye to all my dear friends and family that I love. 'Today is the day I have chosen to pass away with dignity in the face of my terminal illness, this terrible brain cancer that has taken so much from me … but would have taken so much more. 'The world is a beautiful place, travel has been my greatest teacher, my close friends and folks are the greatest givers. I even have a ring of support around my bed as I type. 'Goodbye world. Spread good energy. Pay it forward!' Sean Crowley, a spokesman for Compassion & Choices, said in a statement that Ms Maynard has been suffering 'increasingly frequent and longer seizures' and severe head pain. He added: 'As symptoms grew more severe she chose to abbreviate the dying process by taking the aid-in-dying medication she had received months ago.' At the end of last month, Ms Maynard, who married Mr Diaz at Beltane Ranch, California in 2012, managed to tick off the last item on her bucket list: a visit to the Grand Canyon. She revealed on her website that she had managed to travel from her home in Oregon to Arizona with her husband, mother and stepfather 'thanks to the kindness of Americans around the country who came forward to make my 'bucket list' dream come true'. Happier times: The official, whose Academy is responsible for ethical issues in the Catholic Church, made the remarks just two days after Miss Maynard (pictured), 29, took a lethal prescription of drugs at her  home . Memories: The couple shared one of the last items on Brittany's bucket list - a trip to the Grand Canyon . Mr Diaz described Ms Maynard as a 'beautiful person on the inside' with a 'personality you really get attracted to' just weeks before her death. Talking to People.com in October, the 43-year-old spoke of when they first met, saying at first glance she was beautiful, but as they grew closer he realized she was also stunning on the inside. 'For me it was meeting the person I fell in love with and that was Brittany. Jokingly, she would say I'd certainly been single long enough because there was an age difference between us,' he said. 'And 'What's taken me so long?' and my answer was, honestly, that I hadn't met the girl for me until Brittany.' He said that he quickly realized that she was the woman he wanted to spend the rest of his life with. They met when he was 35 and she was 23. After a five-year romance Mr Diaz proposed in May 2012, and the pair decided to get married that December. They tied the knot in the romantic setting of Beltane Ranch, California.","Brittany Maynard took lethal prescription of drugs at her home in Oregon .

"A couple have been given compensation after NHS staff failed to recognise their baby was in distress - leading to her being stillborn. Wendy Pratt, 36, and husband Chris, 46, sued Scarborough Hospital, North Yorkshire, after staff missed vital signs that their daughter was struggling while in the womb. The couple had tried for a baby for six years and had finally conceived after undergoing IVF on the NHS in 2009. But staff at the hospital failed to recognise signs their baby girl Matilda was in distress, leading to her being delivered stillborn in April 2010 at 27 weeks. Wendy Pratt, 36, and husband Chris, 46, sued Scarborough Hospital, North Yorkshire, after staff missed vital signs their daughter was struggling while in the womb . The devastated couple, of Filey, North Yorkshire, instructed medical negligence lawyers at Irwin Mitchell and the NHS trust has now made an undisclosed payout. It admitted it had not kept a close eye on Mrs Pratt after her 20 week scan, and that if they had Matilda could have survived. Mrs Pratt said: 'We have been trying for a baby ever since we got married 11 years ago. Once we got married and felt secure we knew we wanted to have babies. 'We tried for six years and then we had our first and only shot at NHS funded IVF treatment. 'We had spent three years on the waiting list and then we got the call. I thought this was going to be our chance. 'It was a feeling of our life is going to change one way or the other. I was really dreading it but after a while I was really excited.' The couple were told there was a one in three chance of conceiving and just eight weeks after treatment Mrs Pratt found that she was four weeks pregnant. Staff at the hospital failed to recognise signs their baby girl Matilda was in distress, leading to her being delivered stillborn in April 2010 at 27 weeks . She said: 'I was 25 at the time and I was young so I had that on my side. The hospital were optimistic but for me it was already six years of being disappointed. 'We were just ecstatic and we really thought that was it and we have made it. It was a relief that we weren't having to face a childless future. 'From that point were never thought anything would go wrong.' Midwifery staff told Mrs Pratt her baby was smaller than expected at 20 weeks and that she would need to be closely monitored. But it was another seven weeks before a CTG [to measure the baby's heartbeat] and a scan was provided for her baby. Mrs Pratt, a writer who formally worked as a microbiologist, said: 'It got to the 20 week scan and everything was fine. Despite midwifery staff telling Mrs Pratt her baby was smaller than expected at 20 weeks and that she would need to be closely monitored, it was another seven weeks before a CTG [to measure the baby's heartbeat] and a scan was provided for her baby . 'They said she was measuring small but said it would just be keeping an eye on it. We went away feeling happy and relieved. 'A couple of days later I started having heart palpitations and my GP signed me off work. I relaxed and put my feet up. I had no caffeine or alcohol and I did everything right because it meant so much to us because we had tried for so long. 'Then we got to 24 weeks and she had always been a very active baby. She had a pattern of movements that I knew really well. The movements weren't as defined, weren't as definite. My midwife said it was fine and that some babies are quiet. 'I trusted my midwife because she was my midwife. I just wish that I hadn't.' But still concerned at 27 weeks, Mrs Pratt explained: 'I listened at home on my Doppler device, which you are not supposed to do, and we listened to the heartbeat and I thought it was slowing.' She returned to hospital on April 17, 2010, where staff performed a CTG and two ultrasounds which showed the baby had restricted growth and poor blood flow through the baby's umbilical cord. 'It was about 1am and they said they were going to call a consultant. I know there was something wrong. The consultant scanned me and kept asking if my dates were wrong. He said there was a problem with the blood flow. 'They admitted me and I didn't sleep at all. I couldn't feel her moving. They took me to a scan and the baby's fingers were moving and the consultant said it looked like there had been an improvement. Family picture shows the grave of Matilda Pratt. The devastated couple, of Filey, North Yorkshire, instructed medical negligence lawyers at Irwin Mitchell and the NHS trust has now made an undisclosed payout . 'They sent me home and I was only home for an hour when I said to Chris I didn't feel right and we went back.' Mrs Pratt then readmitted herself because of the continued lack of foetal movements, and another ultrasound was performed that same day. She had seen three different consultants at Scarborough Hospital. On April 20 they were transferred to Leeds General Infirmary for another scan and a CTG. She said: 'We drove ourselves to Leeds and I felt like they were waiting for the baby to die. They didn't even give us an ambulance. 'They were getting me to sign things and preparing me for surgery and were getting ready to spray me with the epidural and her heart started to slow down. 'It was Chris who had to tell me that she hadn't made it. She still had a heartbeat but it stopped during the delivery. It was all really quick.' But the baby's heart rate started to drop as Mrs Pratt was prepared for an emergency C-section. Matilda was delivered by emergency caesarean and could not be resuscitated. She said: 'There is just a catalogue of mistakes that ended up costing my daughters life. Waking up in theatre was a dividing line to my life before and after my child dying.' Mrs Pratt said the couple have since used their compensation for three more rounds of IVF treatment - sadly suffering two miscarriages in 2011 and 2012. Now they're urging others to speak out to make sure the same mistakes don't happen again . The couple decided to take legal action and York Teaching Hospital NHS Trust have now agreed to pay an undisclosed amount after admitting that had they performed a CTG scan after her 20 week scan, Matilda would, on the balance of probabilities, have been born alive. The couple have since used their compensation for three more rounds of IVF treatment - sadly suffering two miscarriages in 2011 and 2012. Now the couple urging others to speak out to make sure the same mistakes don't happen again. 'It's important that people speak out. The NHS is being pushed to its limits and if you keep pushing them then mistakes will happen. 'If people don't speak up then nothing changes.' Sarah Coles, a specialist medical lawyer at Irwin Mitchell's Leeds office, representing the couple, said: 'This is a tragic case that has left Wendy and Chris absolutely devastated by the loss of their longed-for daughter Matilda. They have both found it incredibly difficult to accept what happened and they have needed extensive support to help them come to terms with their loss. 'What is clear is that the midwives made a number of errors and failed to detect and act upon basic signs which highlighted things were not right and ultimately led to Matilda being stillborn. 'Whilst we welcome the admission of liability from the Trust and settlement, it remains very difficult and painful for the family to come to terms with the fact Matilda's death could have been avoided.' York Teaching Hospital NHS Trust have been contacted for a comment.","Wendy Pratt, 36, and husband Chris, 46, sued Scarborough Hospital .

"Accused: Frank Onyeachonam, 40, is accused of swindling more than £250,000 out of pensioners by telling them they had won the lottery and asking for 'activation fees' A man swindled pensioners out of their life savings by telling them they had won millions of pounds on the lottery, a court has heard. Frank Onyeachonam, 40, is said to have targeted elderly American victims with his scheme billed as a 'life-changing prize'. Believing they had struck good fortune, victims were allegedly persuaded to pay a small fee to release their winnings. But he then continued to request further 'modest sums' - amounting to more than £250,000, it is said. Prosecutor Joel Smith told the Old Bailey in London: ‘By its very nature this type of fraud plays on the vulnerable and often elderly. ‘Indeed, . the scam could be seen as doubly cruel - not only were some of the . victims left to come to terms with the financial loss and the impact of . being duped, but also with the fact that they had not, as they genuinely . believed they had, won a life changing sum of money.’ Onyechonam, of east London, is accused of running the seven-year scam between 2005 and 2012, sending out letters to potential victims, describing the foreign prize they had supposedly won. The pensioners were told to pay a modest sum to an 'agent' - Onyechonam - who would 'release' their winnings, the jury heard. This money was then said to have been wired back to the UK. Wire transfer payments were made to the UK with Onyeachonam’s late associate Carvin Ehirim receiving payments of £80,365.74. Co-defendant Lawrencia Emenyonu, 38, is accused of laundering the victim’s cash through an adult vocational schooling company called Renciae, which she was director of. Her partner Bernard Armah, 51, is said to have helped after stashing ‘large and unexplained’ sums of money from his wife in his personal account. Emenyonu allegedly received £59,883.67 in 2012 and £25,167.73 during 2012. Western Union payments totalling at least £256,000 can be attributed to the fraud but the total amount of loss is unknown. Joyce Abbot, 80, was swindled out of £60,000 after receiving a letter to her house in Maine, US, telling her she had won £1,950,000 in an Australian lottery on 30 July 2010. Standing trial: Co-accused Lawrencia Emenyonu, 38 (left), allegedly laundered victims' money through an adult schooling company she owns. Her partner Bernard Armah, 51 (right), is said to have helped stashing cash . She was asked to ring an agent called ‘Jeff Lloyds’, said to be one of Onyeachonam’s pseudonyms, who claimed he would help her obtain her winnings if she paid ‘activation fees’. The SIM card with ‘Jeff Lloyds’ number was found next to Onyeachonam’s bed when he was arrested, jurors heard. Seattle resident David Vawter, 63, was informed he had won £2.8m in an Australian lottery, then asked to contact ‘Dr Jeff Lloyds’ who demanded a series of payments for fake taxes and administrative fees. Once hooked, Onyeachonam bled up to £40,000 from Mr Vawter, who still owes over £20,000 to his parents and brother, the court heard. There are 13 known victims of the fraud in America and one victim has been traced in England . Onyeachonam, of east London, denies conspiracy to defraud between January 2005 and December 2012. Emenyonu and Armah, both of north London, deny money laundering for the same period of time. The trial continues.

"The presiding judge in the bitter divorce battle between Oprah Winfrey's father Vernon and his wife Barbara said the 'decision' to end their 14-year marriage was made by a third party, MailOnline can reveal. Judge Donald P. Harris told Chancery Court in Franklin, Tennessee that he believed neither Vernon, 81, nor his wife Barbara, 66, decided on the legal separation. 'I've been a judge for 28 years. And I felt like in this case, number one, that Ms. Winfrey does not want a divorce, and I feel like Mr. Winfrey didn't make the decision to seek this divorce.' Moving on: Barbara Winfrey, the ex-wife of Oprah's father Vernon, was booted out of her home by the talk queen yesterday. Oprah 'gifted"" the five -bedroom home to Vernon and Barbara shortly after they married 14 years ago. But Oprah never really gave up ownership and control of the own - and her father's finances . Scene from a marriage: Barbara and Vernon were good together for a time. But things began to go sour after Barbara discovered he cheated in his barber shop with a crack-addicted prositiute called 'One Tooth' The statement - revealed for the first time in official court records obtained by MailOnline - adds fuel to Barbara Winfrey’s claim that Oprah took part in a 'conspiracy' to force her father to divorce her and kick her out of her $1.4million home. Judge Harris presided over the 18-month divorce which went to court and culminated in November last year. The respected official, who is also a Special Judge in the Tennessee Supreme Court, told the court towards the end of the case that he'd 'stayed awake' most of the night thinking about a solution. At one point Judge Harris said he was going to 'flat ask Ms. Winfrey if she wanted a divorce and then proceed accordingly,' but decided against that course of action. And the judge even suggested that both sides should work their differences out without ending the marriage. 'There are ways you can form an agreement that keeps them married,' he said. Former high-school Vice-Principal Barbara has confirmed that despite her and Vernon's differences she never wanted a divorce. She believes Vernon's hand was forced by his famous daughter Oprah who 'disliked' her step-mom. According . to bombshell legal documents seen by MailOnline Barbara claims the chat . show queen attended 'secret meetings' with dad Vernon during which they . plotted to get her out of the family home in Franklin, south Nashville. Happier days: Oprah wrote 'Love & Blessings' on this photograph of her and Barbara taken at the superstar's 50th birthday party in Chicago in 2004. But Oprah hasn't shown her stepmother much love in words or deed over the years, says Barbara . Real estate: Barbara doesn't know what Oprah will do with the $1.4 million mansion. 'Oprah's a billionaire three times over, her help live better than this,' says Barbara . The lawsuit states that one took place on Mother's Day in May 2012 - and Vernon filed for divorce just a month later. Barbara also alleges that Oprah was so intent on orchestrating the split that she threatened to cut Vernon off financially unless he broke up with her. The judge's comments will have infuriated Oprah and her team of lawyers who have tried to keep a lid on the whole affair. What's more Judge Harris suggested that Barbara should be allowed to continue to care for frail barber Vernon. He said: 'I'm satisfied that it would be in both of their best interests for Ms. Winfrey to be available to take care of Mr. Winfrey from this point forward. 'I hope you will explore that. There are agreements that you could make that keep them married but maybe give up certain rights or something. And I hope that you will explore it. Because, you know, that's the way I feel.' Barbara, who still loves her ex-husband and worries about his health, said she was more than happy to continue caring for Vernon. But, she said, Oprah wouldn't allow it. Vernon lives alone in a $400,000 four bed home his celebrity daughter bought him in Nashville. Barbara told MailOnline: 'Vernon and I are still friends, we speak on the phone once a week, but I can't go to see him, there are people watching. 'But I feel so sorry for him, there's no one looking after him.' Boxed in: Vernon is letting Barbara keep most of the furniture they bought as a couple. She's putting those pieces and other personal possessions  in storage until she can find a place of her own . Among her souvenirs: Movers help Barbara pack of her furniture and treasure from her marriage to Vernon . And in a dig at Oprah she added: 'Why would you put your 81-year-old dad in a four bedroom house to live by himself.' In legal papers Vernon denies that Oprah has ever intervened in his relationship or threatened to cut his money if he didn't divorce his wife. But Barbara says she has learned the hard way not to cross her daughter-in-law. Barbara describes Oprah as a manipulative, high-handed and the 'devil' incarnate. 'What she has done is nothing short of evil, but she doesn't scare me, her actions cause me to disrespect her,' she says. In November last year Judge Harris chastised Vernon for 'adultery and inappropriate marital conduct.' He ordered him to pay his ex-wife almost $70,000 in attorney fees. During proceedings it was revealed that Vernon gifted a property that he and his wife had owned — free-of-charge - to another man. Vernon allowed it to go into foreclosure 'knowing that it would be purchased by his daughter... to defeat any interest of Barbara Winfrey.' As a result, Judge Harris penalized Vernon for his apparent scheming, ordering that he be held liable for one of the pair's loan accounts and Barbara 'be held harmless' because of his actions. 'Thus, the marital estate has a net value of $121,686,' the judge noted. 'The court is of the opinion that each of the parties be awarded property and indebtedness with a net value of $60,843. Vernon Winfrey is awarded all the marital property except for the household furnishings located in the marital residence.' But Barbara said: 'Yes I got the furniture, but after I paid the attorney fees, all the bills and expenses I didn't have a dime left, no alimony, nothing.' It was not until November 2012, five months after the divorce had been filed, that Barbara discovered that she would be evicted from her home. Oprah had bought the property with her money and so kept her name on the title, meaning she was legally allowed to sell it. Barbara, who had lived at the house for 14 years, was forced to move out at midnight on Thursday.","Judge Donald P.

"Rumours suggest that Facebook is about to add video features to its photo-sharing app Instagram and will announce the changes at a conference later this week. According to an internal source, the social network has been recently testing a feature that would let Instagram users record and share five to 10-second video clips. If confirmed, the feature will rival video-sharing Vine app - which is owned by Twitter - that lets users record and share six-second video loops on Android and iOS devices. Facebook has officially revealed a new video sharing service. Called Video on Instagram, it will pit the firm against Twitter's hugely popular Vine service by letting users record 15-second video clips . Last week Facebook announced it was adding clickable hashtags to the site. When a Facebook user now adds a . hashtagged word or phrase to a post, other users will be able to click . it and use it as a search term. Hashtag phrases include multiple words stringed together. They . will be presented with a list of other users across the site that are . also currently using that word or phrase and discussing the same things. Other . users who are also watching the show, or who aren't watching it but are . interested in following what's happening, can click the hashtag. The results will be shown as a list that users can scroll through and watch the discussion develop at a glance. Facebook bought Instagram in 2012 after an alleged bidding war with Twitter. It is expected to announce updates to the photo-sharing app as well as other products at a press conference scheduled for 20 June. Freelance journalist Matthew Keys broke the Instagram video story at the end of May. He claimed a source familiar with the plans had told him Facebook was testing the feature, but didn't want to give their name because they were not permitted to speak publicly about the news. A number of selected journalists were recently sent an invitation from Facebook that simply read: 'A small team has been working on a big product. Facebook bought photo-sharing app Instagram, left, last year. If it adds video features to the app it will compete with Twitter's Vine app, pictured right, that currently lets users record and share six-second video clips . 'Join us for a coffee and learn about a new product.' The event is due to take place on 20 June. Speculation about what Facebook is about to announce has been rife and another rumour suggests the site may also launch a news reader app. Google announced it would discontinue its own Reader services and app earlier this year and they went offline on 1 June and Facebook could use this to its advantage. According to TechCrunch, the reader app could be a 'trending articles on Facebook' feature or an 'RSS reader-style product.' Facebook recently invited select journalists to a product launch event on 20 June. The invitation, pictured, claims a small team has been working on a big idea. Other rumours suggest the site could also be about to launch a news reader app . Facebook announced last week it was adding clickable hashtags to the site which make it easier for users to follow discussions about certain topics. These could also fit with plans for an RSS-reader tool. Clickable hashtags are already used on Instagram as well as Twitter and Vine. Twitter bought Vine in October last year. The app initially launched on iOS devices before being made available for Android phones earlier this month. Vine has previously been used to record surgical operations and at the start of June a 16-year-old claimed he had managed to crash the app by uploading a Rick Astley music video. The video bypassed the app's six-second limit which is thought to have caused the servers to temporarily crash.","An internal source has claimed Facebook is testing a video feature for its Instagram app and will announce the plans at an upcoming event .

"Pauline Hanson's is ready to again shake up the main political game, announcing that she is set to lead the One Nation party once more. Ms Hanson confirmed to Daily Mail Australia on Wednesday that she has returned to her former party and will aim to have the name officially changed to Pauline Hanson's One Nation. And the outspoken and often controversial politician has wasted no time in making her mark, declaring that Palmer United Party's Jacqui Lambie, who has been dumped as the party's deputy Senate leader: 'Is walking in my shoes'. Scroll down for video . Pauline Hanson's wants back in the main political game, announcing she is seeking to lead the One Nation party once more . Pauline Hanson relaxes at home on Wednesday after announcing she would be seeking to have her leadership of the One Nation party ratified at a November 29 meeting . All smiles. Pauline Hanson is happy to be back in the political fray . Pauline Hanson holds a press conference at her home south-west of Brisbane on Wednesday . Hanson has announced her return to the One Nation party to become its leader after a 12-year hiatus . Ms Hanson started political career as an Ipswich Councillor in 1994 . She has also set her sights on old political foe Tony Abbott labelling the G20 Summit 'was all about grandstanding by supposed world leaders and a huge waste of taxpayer money'. 'I know where the $470 million could have been better spent on Australians,' she added. 'And what do we really know of the free trade deal with China? We will get rid of our tariffs from day one but what about them, they have still got their tariffs in place, when will the Chinese act on that, we haven't been told. And the US President was not immune to criticism. 'They all seem to forget that they were put there to serve the people. Barack Obama, with the rewiring and redoing of a hotel, they are not world leaders,' she told DMA. However, Ms Hanson, 60, freely admits that her family is not entirely convinced about her return. Pauline Hanson began her political career as an Ipswich Councillor before being voted into the House of Representatives in 1996 as Member for Oxley . 'My children do worry for me going back into it but the people of Australia want and deserve an honest voice' said Pauline Hanson as she announced her return to the main political game . A familiar face on the hustings again. Pauline Hanson has vowed to take voter support away from the major parties at the next Queensland and Federal elections . Pauline Hanson co-founded the One Nation Party in 1997 and is set to be reconfirmed as the party leader at a November 29 meeting of members . 'My children do worry for me going back into it but the people of Australia want and deserve an honest voice, so they want to know what's going on,' she told DMA. The plan is to take control of the party she co-founded and the change of name will be put to Queensland members on November 29. First target is the Queensland State Election and then the Federal poll in two years time. But, she also admits that there is much work to be done to rebuild the once powerful but now ailing party. 'There are not many members left, it is going to be a big job to revitalise the party but I am determined to,' Ms Hanson said. 'I have already backed one candidate in the past week and have a few others in mind.' Her political career has been as controversial as it has been colourful. Ms Hanson's ""please explain"" retort to a television interviewer's question as to whether she was xenophobic has followed her throughout public life. Her initial foray was in fact as a councillor in Ipswich and then, ahead of the 1996 Federal Election, Ms Hanson was disendorsed by the Liberal Party. She would go on to win the seat of Oxley and stood as an Independent MP and a year later the One Nation Party would enter Australia's political landscape. At the two subsequent elections, with redistribution effectively forcing her out of Oxley and into Blair, Ms Hanson would prove unsuccessful despite enjoying very strong primary support. Internal party disputes and allegations further eroded her public backing and then in 2003 Pauline Hanson was convicted of electoral fraud and sent to three years jail. She would spend 11 weeks in prison before the Queensland Court of Appeal quashed the conviction and ordered her immediate release. Unsuccessful tilts at both the NSW and Queensland State elections would follow, as would two more ultimately failed attempts to regain a seat in Federal parliament at the 2007 and 2013 polls. Pauline Hanson said that Palmer United Party's Jacqui Lambie, who has been dumped as the party's deputy Senate leader, 'is walking in my shoes' Pauline Hanson said the G20 Summit was nothing more than 'political grandstanding and a waste of taxpayers money' The decision to return to politics, she says, was prompted by her disappointment at the current crop of politicians. 'I'm very disillusioned by it and I honestly believe I can make a difference,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'I'm sick and tired of all the corruption and lies and there is too much interest in overseas interest.' Despite her support for Senator Lambie she said it had become clear to her that Clive Palmer's PUP group was not going to be the alternative third major party Australians were hoping for. 'I'm very disillusioned by it and I honestly believe I can make a difference' said Pauline Hanson . 'I was hoping Clive Palmer and his party would be able to do it but they haven't,' she said. 'How can you criticise Jacqui Lambie? I won't, she has stood up for what she believes in and in some ways she is being that individual on the floor of parliament that I was, I can't criticise that. 'I've been sent to prison and ridiculed all my political life but I haven't given up. 'I got pushed out of my own party in 2002 but I rejoined last year and now it's time to rebuild it. 'This is a huge decision for me but I have always tried to keep Australians aware of what is going on. 'They describe me as far right wing, I am not, I am centre and that's what Australians want. They want to know about their jobs, the home they hope they can afford and if they get sick that they will get a hospital bed.' She sounded a warning to the major parties saying 'they know I can take away their voter base, like I did before'. The One Nation website calls her 'the redhead you can trust'.

In an unsigned editorial in the influential medical journal The Lancet, experts argue that grief does not require psychiatrists . and that 'legitimising' the treatment of grief with antidepressants 'is . not only dangerously simplistic, but also flawed.' The debate follows a decision by the American Psychiatric Association to classify grief as a mental illness in a bid to allow to doctors to be more flexible about how early patients can be treated for depression after the death of a loved one. Bereaved not ill: A controversial decision to reclassify grief as a mental illness has been criticised by medical experts in The Lancet (file photo) The lead editorial states: 'Grief is not an illness; it is more usefully thought of as part of being human and a normal response to the death of a loved one.' The Lancet's comments follow the APA's decision to add grief reactions to their list of . mental illnesses in their fifth edition of the psychiatry 'bible', . Diagnostic . and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, (DSM-5), which is due out in . 2013. But The Lancet, along with many psychiatrists and psychologists have called for the changes to be halted - saying they would lead to a 'tick . box’ system that did not consider the wider needs of patients but . labelled them as 'mentally ill’. They agree that in rare cases, bereavement will develop into prolonged grief or major depression that may merit medical treatment. However, they suggested that for the majority of the bereaved, 'doctors would do better to offer time, compassion, remembrance and empathy, than pills.' The DSM-5 proposal - which has been opposed by The Lancet's editorial writers - would eliminate the so-called 'grief exclusion.' This 'exclusion' means that anyone who has experienced bereavement cannot be diagnosed as depressed for a certain period of time. In a previous edition, DSM-III, that period of time was set at one year. The DSM-IV reduced that period to two months and DSM-5 plans to reduce the period to just two weeks. The unsigned lead editorial reads: 'Grief is not an illness; it is more usefully thought of as part of being human and a normal response to the death of a loved one' (file photo) Although the proposed changes to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and . Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) would not directly . affect clinical practice here, where doctors tend to use different . international guidelines, experts say it would eventually influence . research and thinking in the field. Defending the change in timeframe,  Dr. Kenneth S. Kendler, a member of the DSM-5 Mood Disorder Working Group, said it would allow for an earlier diagnosis but would by no means force it. Simon Wessely, of the Institute of . Psychiatry, King’s College, London, said 'We need to be very careful . before further broadening the boundaries of illness and disorder.' 'Back in 1840 the Census of the United States included just one category for mental disorder. 'By 1917 the American Psychiatric . Association recognised 59, rising to 128 in 1959, 227 in 1980, and 347 . in the last revision. Do we really need all these labels? Probably not. And there is a real danger that shyness will become social phobia, . bookish kids labelled as Asperger’s and so on.’ 'Grief is not an illness; it is more . usefully thought of as part of being human and a normal response to the . death of a loved one' Whereas people who are bereaved are . currently given help where necessary, in future they might find . themselves labelled as having a depressive disorder if their symptoms . lasted longer than a certain period of time, he added. Peter Kinderman, Professor of Clinical Psychology and Head of Institute . of Psychology, University of Liverpool, said 'It will exacerbate the . problems that result from trying to fit a medical, diagnostic, system to . problems that just don’t fit nicely into those boxes. 'Perhaps most seriously, it will pathologise a wide range of problems . which should never be thought of as mental illnesses. Many people who . are shy, bereaved, eccentric, or have unconventional romantic lives will . suddenly find themselves labelled as 'mentally ill’. Dr. Arthur Kleinman, a Harvard psychiatrist, social anthropologist and global health expert, says that the main problem is the lack of 'conclusive scientific evidence to show what a normal length of bereavement is.' According to the Lancet writers, 'it is often not until 6 months, or the first anniversary of the death, that grieving can move into a less intense phase.' They added that grieving is individual, shaped by age, gender, religious beliefs and the strength of the relationship with the lost loved one.","Treatment of grief with antidepressants is 'dangerously simplistic', experts say .

"Apple's iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C handsets are still in high demand following their launch in September, but already rumours are circulating about what the next handsets could look like. The latest speculate about what the size of the 'iPhone 6' handset's display might be and suggests the fabled smartphone will include a full HD 1080p Retina screen. The rumour comes from a Japanese magazine called Mac Fan. An illustration of what Apple's next generation iPhone might look-like. The handset is rumoured to sport a Retina HD screen that is measures five inches diagonally . The magazine said the screen of the iPhone 6 handset is expected to measure 5 inches diagonally. This would make it an inch larger than the iPhone 5S' screen and it would directly compete with Google's Nexus 5, announced earlier this week. However, recent rumours suggested that Apple has not yet decided how large to make the new screen of its flagship handset, Yahoo! News reported. The Mac Fan rumour also suggests that Apple's next iPhone handset will launch in September 2014. This would fit in with the company's launch pattern and give the iPhone 5S, which features a fingerprint scanner, a full year as Apple's highest-spec handset. While the spec of the iPhone 6 handset will be under scrutiny until the smartphone launches, fans of Apple's mobile offerings will no doubt be interested in what finish and colours the phone will come in. A survey recently revealed that different sexes are often drawn to different coloured iPhones. Chicago-based Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP) examined buying behaviour of Apple's luxurious iPhone 5S handset, which comes in three colours: space grey, silver and gold. A survey has recently revealed that different sexes are often drawn to different coloured iPhones. Chicago-based Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP) examined buying behaviour of Apple's luxurious iPhone 5S handset, which comes in three colours: space grey, silver and gold (pictured) Space grey accounts for 43 per cent of all sales of the handset and the study found that men predominantly chose the favourite grey shade, while most women preferred the lighter and more sparkly silver option. Interestingly, the gold iPhone 5S, which was originally reported in being the most short in supply, accounted for 27 per cent of sales and was equally popular among men and women. Whatever the next handset looks like, Apple will have to compete more fiercely with Samsung than ever before, which is squeezing Apple with a 2.5 per cent rise in market share. Samsung Electronics shipped a record 88.4 million smartphones in the third quarter of this year to take its global market share above 35 per cent, while rival Apple's slice thinned, according to recent research data. The figure marked a 55 per cent surge for Samsung over the same period last year, the independent research firm Strategy Analytics said. The South Korean tech company's market share swelled to 35.2 per cent from 32.9 pec ent in the third quarter of 2012, whereas Apple's market share dipped from 15.6 per cent to 13.4 per cent. Japanese magazine Mac Fan said the screen of the iPhone 6 handset will measure 5 inches diagonally, which would make it an inch larger than the luxurious iPhone 5S' screen (pictured in gold), if the rumour proves true .","The rumour comes from a Japanese magazine called Mac Fan .

"Wanted: Zafar Chishti, Britain's most-wanted tax fraudster, believed to be on the run in Dubai, was ordered to pay back £5million in criminal proceeds . Britain's most-wanted tax fraudster has been told he must pay back £5million from his share of a VAT swindle worth £176million - if police ever catch up with him. Zafar Chishti, 34, was a financial director involved in a mobile phone sales scam that is one of Britain's biggest-ever tax swindles. But he vanished long before police came looking for him and now, as his accomplices languish in jail, he is thought to be living in luxury in Dubai. Chishti and his associates claimed huge amounts of money from the government in a complex 'missing trader' scam involving the import and export of phones from other EU countries. They falsely claimed to have traded in four million handsets - worth a staggering £1.7billion - then claimed the VAT on those transactions back from the government. To make the deals appear legitimate they set up a series of offshore accounts to throw investigators off the scent. Fifteen gang members were jailed for a total of 66 years in 2012 after the plot was unravelled in a series of trials at Kingston Crown Court. The complex plot involved the VAT free import and export of mobile phones from EU countries. The gang created false paperwork relating to the alleged importation, sale and export of phones. The phones were purported to have been sold on in the UK, with VAT added on, through a chain of firms known as ‘buffers’. Invoices were then created to pull off the fraud. The gang then claimed to have sold up to four million phones to claim the VAT back from the government - but in reality the tax was never paid in the first place. Chishti, who was jailed for 12 years in his absence, was yesterday told he must serve another seven if he fails to produce the £5million. But the reality is that police may never track him down. Meanwhile, Dilawar Ravjani, who is serving a 17-year sentence after he was identified as the ringleader of the plot, was yesterday ordered to repay £30million immediately or serve another 10 years in prison. Tamraz Riaz, 37, who was jailed for 13 years for laundering proceeds through his business Crystal Cars, was ordered to repay £200,435 within four months or face a further two and a half years in prison. Rajesh Gathani, 49, described as a phone trader for the Ravjani companies, was jailed for eight years. He must now repay £56,084 within three months or serve a further 18 months in prison. In jail: Dilawar Ravjani, left, who is serving a 17 years, was ordered to repay £30million immediately or face another decade in jail. Rajesh Gathani, right, 49, must repay £56,084 or serve a further 18 months in prison . Millions of pounds had been laundered using a company called Property and Management Services run by Roshan Hussain via an offshore bank and car sales businesses. At the centre of the fraud was Future Communications (UK) Ltd - part of the Ravjani Corporation Innovative Global Business Group Ltd (IGB) which traded from Commercial House, Honeypot Lane, Stanmore, Middlesex. Accomplice: John Conroy admitted fraudulent trading and was jailed for three years in the original trial at Kingston Crown Court in 2012 . Jurors heard there were more than 20 companies in the Ravjani Corporation which was owned by Haidar Ravjani and controlled by his son Dilawar and daughter Roshan Hussain. Dilawar Ravjani, formerly of Stanmore, Middlesex, was convicted of conspiracy to cheat and jailed for 17 years in July 2012; Chishti, formerly Watford, was found guilty of conspiracy to cheat and was jailed for a total of 12 years; Riaz, of Wakefield, west Yorkshire, was found guilty of conspiracy to cheat the Public Revenue and jailed for 13 years; Gathani, of Pinner, Middlesex, admitted conspiracy to cheat and was jailed for eight years; Roshan, a director of Unique Distribution, which was also part of IGB, trading from Suffolk Way, Abingdon, Oxfordshire, was earlier locked up for 12 months for her involvement in the con in July 2012. John McFarnon, the former managing . director of IGB subsidiary Unique Distribution, was jailed for three . years for his role in the fraud. Businessman . John Conroy, who owned a luxury villa in Marbella, Spain, was described . as a shadow director of Unique Distribution. He admitted fraudulent . trading and was jailed for three years.

Scroll down for video . Agnieszka Dabska, who has arachnophpobia, has kept her windows shut for three years because the tree outside her home is infested with spiders . She said: 'I absolutely hate spiders. Even when I see a little house spider I have to get my son to kill it for me. I've got goosebumps just thinking about it. 'But as for these spiders - they've been multiplying in the tree over a long summer and there are thousands of them. They have got these huge cocoons under the gutters and on my windows there are massive webs. 'There are even spider cocoons in my windows. They were nesting in a little panel at the top. I'm so desperate to keep them out I've put a line of chestnuts on every windowsill in the house. I know it's an old wives tale, but I've got to do something.

Ms Dabska said she is so distressed by the army of eight-legged creatures that since she moved in three years ago she has only opened the windows on the other side of the house which are well away from the reach of the spiders in the tree. She claims Cardiff council have not responded to her requests to cut it down. 'After I posted a note online, someone came and hacked off some of the branches so it is a bit better now, but no one ever calls me about it.' She is so distressed by the army of eight-legged creatures that since she moved in three years ago she has only opened the windows on the other side of the house which are well away from the reach of the spiders .

'The only thing I can do is pay the guy who cleans the windows a little bit extra to clear away the webs and cocoons,' she said. Ely Councillor Sue Goddard said: 'We don't have a letter from Ms Dabska on record, but now that we are aware of this we will see what we can do. However it is unlikely that the council would cut down the tree as it is their policy not to cut down healthy trees. 'As it happens we have been trying to get some other trees pruned for about five years on Plymouth Wood Close, and so we will be adding her concerns to a letter we are addressing to the council's parks department.'

"Hundreds of armed supporters of a controversial religious leader clashed with riot police as they tried to storm his fortified ashram  in northern India today. Police fired tear gas and water cannons at followers of Rampal Maharaj, 63, who have spent  several days holed up in a sprawling compound outside Hisar city, 110miles north of New Delhi. The self-styled guru, or 'godman' has repeatedly refused to appear in court to answer several criminal charges, including conspiracy to murder, inciting mobs and contempt of court. Violent support: Followers of Rampal Maharaj throw pieces of bricks and stones towards police during a protest outside the self-styled guru's ashram in Hisar in the northern Indian state of Haryan . Aggression: Police detain a supporter of Rampal Maharaj during a protest outside the ashram on Tuesday . Devoteed: Dozens of Rampal Maharaj followers were seen holding several posters of the 'guru' during a non-violent sit-in protest in New Delhi earlier today . Rampal Maharaj has given himself the title of 'guru, a Sanskrit term for 'teacher' or 'master', and he is accused of using his followers as human shields. More than 100 officers have suffered bullet and other injuries at the compound in Haryana state where supporters are holed up with Maharaj . 'We had prior information that they had stones, petrol bombs, weapons, batons and sticks and acid pouches,' Police chief SN Vashisht told reporters in the nearby city of Chandigarh. 'The police tried to break down the wall of the ashram today because we believe that the people who are inside are not really supporters but are being used as human shields. 'We will not stop until we catch this criminal,' he added. Putting up a fight: Officers drag a woman away from the ashram during the clashes on Tuesday . Dangerous misson: Hundreds of armed supporters clashed with riot police at the fortified ashram . Supporters of Rampal Maharaj stand on a roof above Indian security officials during a confrontation at the fortified ashram outside Hisar city . Riot police an activist along the ground as they storm the ashram in an attempt to arrest Rampal Maharaj . Television footage showed chaotic scenes, with police armed with sticks dragging away supporters, including women, and bulldozers driving towards the ashram's high outer walls. Devotees described scenes of panic inside the building, with some saying they were stopped from leaving by more senior supporters as police moved in, according to the Press Trust of India (PTI) news agency. 'There are so many people still inside and the vast majority of them want to leave. But they are not being allowed to leave,' one woman who managed to flee told PTI. Police have not yet located Maharaj but have surrounded the compound, vowing to continue the operation until he was arrested. 'We have also given an ultimatum to those holed inside that they can come out if they want to, they would be given a safe passage,' Vashisht said. Police in recent days have cut off water and electricity and blocked roads to prevent deliveries of food to the ashram to try to flush out the guru and his flock. Ambulances were seen racing towards the ashram in the town of Barwala late Tuesday. Maharaj's legal counsel has cited ill health as a reason for his failure to appear three times in the High Court. But an official helping with the case accused him of openly defying the court. Supporters of Rampal Maharaj take shelter under placards as they are hit by a police water cannon during a protest outside the ashram . Injuries: Nurses care for an injured supporter of Rampal Maharaj at a hospital in Hisar after the clashes . A woman has to have stitches to her head after police stormed the compound where Rampal Maharaj has been holed up with his supporters . Human shield: Rampal Maharaj has repeatedly refused to appear in court to answer several criminal charges, including conspiracy to murder, inciting mobs and contempt of court . 'Baba Rampal (Maharaj) has raised a private army of supporters who are openly confronting with the police, the government and the administration,' said Anupam Gupta, an 'amicus curiae' (friend of the court) -- a party who offers information in a case. 'He has openly proclaimed that he is above the law and judicial systems,' Gupta told reporters. Supporters also protested in New Delhi to proclaim their leader's innocence, as police looked on. 'We expect nothing less than justice for our guru, who is innocent...he is just not someone who can do any of the things for which he is charged,' said Nathu Lal at the protest in the centre of the capital. Police accuse Maharaj of ordering his disciples to fire on villagers during clashes in 2006 in which one person was killed and scores injured. India has been rocked by several scandals involving immensely popular 'godmen', mostly Hindu ascetics who claim mystical powers. Last year one was charged with sexually assaulting a schoolgirl. On his website Maharaj, an engineer by profession, says he follows the 15th-century mystic poet Kabir, who has many devotees in India and abroad. For many Indians, gurus play an integral role in daily life. They say they offer a pathway to enlightenment in return for spiritual devotion and often donations to ashrams, temples and charity projects.","Rampal Maharaj, a self-styled guru, is wanted on several criminal charges .

"They were built to slash a college's carbon emissions and save them tens of thousands of pounds in energy bills. But some people must have been left wondering if the new 'solar meadow' will live up to its billing as it opened today under grey and rainy skies. The site at the Midlothian campus of Edinburgh College in Dalkeith is Scotland's first solar meadow and one of the most northerly locations for the green technology in Europe. Staff and the local MSP stroll around the site under the cloudy skies and hold umbrellas to ward off the rain . The 2,500 solar panels are expected to cut the college's carbon emissions by 300,000kg a year . The five-acre site cost £1.2million to build and was designed by SSE Energy Solutions. It promises to decrease the college's carbon emissions by 300,000kg a year and meet all the campus' electricity demands. But dignitaries who turned out for the grand opening had to walk through the rain with not a beam of sunlight in sight. Dressed in bright hi-viz jackets, the group including local MSP Colin Beattie, staff, students and business leaders, were pictured holding umbrellas aloft as they inspected the site. Backers of the project also hope it will become a local attraction. Wildflowers and various grasses are to be planted in the meadow to increase the site's biodiversity. Professor Steve Tinsley, vice-principal of Edinburgh College, who is leading the project, said: 'We believe the solar meadow also looks . great and will become a significant attraction for local people as well . as visitors to the capital. 'It . is also fantastic that the project has enabled the college to engage . with schools and local community groups to develop their own renewable . energy projects. 'It really is giving something back to the local . community in more ways than one.' Student Beatrice Athanasiou walks through the site that backers hope will become a local attraction . The solar meadow, which can still generate energy under in overcast conditions, will also be used as a teaching facility for students. The creation of solar farms around the world has used so much fossil fuel that they will not contribute any 'real' energy until 2020, a study found. The Stanford University research found the panels have only just begun to surpass the amount of energy ploughed into creating the installations. The energy used to produce solar panels is intense. The initial step in producing the silicon at the heart of most panels is to melt silica rock at 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit using electricity, commonly from coal-fired power plants. There is also an energy cost in shipping and installing the panels. However, because of technological advances, the solar power industry is poised to pay off its debt of energy as early as 2015 and no later than 2020. It will act as an outdoor classroom for engineering students as the performance of the panels and environmental conditions are monitored. '[The solar meadow] will help not only to provide the next generation of engineers with essential skills, but also allow the college to become less reliant on fossil fuel energy,' said Prof Tinsley. The meadow will also be used as a research centre where the interaction between biodiversity and solar technology is analysed, including the effect of environmental conditions on the output from the solar panels such as weather and pollen. A research assistant from Edinburgh Napier University will join the team of staff and students from Edinburgh College to collect and analyse the data. The students are also excited with the development of the meadow. Alana Beaton, 23, from Inverness, is studying NC Intermediate Electrical Engineering, said: 'I'm really interested in renewable energy and I'm excited that Edinburgh College is leading the way with the solar meadow. 'I'm really looking forward to using the solar meadow as part of my course. 'I think it will further my interests within solar energy technologies and modern engineering in Scotland.' Richard Chandler, SSE's head of green deal and energy solutions, said: 'The solar meadow will not only generate around 560,000 kWhrs every year, enough energy to power 170 homes, but is also a fine example of how industry and education can work well together. 'This project will bring benefits to the college, its students and the wider community as well as further strengthening Scotland's renewable energy resources.'

"A father warned other parents today of the dangers of children playing computer games online after sexual comments were made to his six-year-old son. The boy was playing Minecraft on his Xbox in his room in Middlesbrough, when he was allegedly sent a series of sexually explicit comments by an unknown man in audio and written messages. Cleveland Police were investigating what had happened today after receiving a report from the father. He cannot be named to protect the identity of his son, who has Asperger syndrome. Game: The boy was playing Minecraft (above, file picture) on his Xbox in his Middlesbrough bedroom . The man, who is a carer for his son, said: ‘I’ve had people saying things to me about how he shouldn’t have been on Xbox Live by himself, and I hold my hands up that I made mistakes. ‘I didn’t even think you could use that for chat. I’ve now been taught how to make it safe and I’ll be doing that before he gets the Xbox back. I’m not ready for him to go back on it yet though. ‘I live on my own with my son so I can’t be with him 24 hours a day. I was downstairs tidying up and he was in his room for literally half an hour. He got all these messages in that half an hour. ‘The first message was sent at 6.22pm and the last at 6.52pm. I check on him all the time. I went upstairs and heard a man’s voice. Console: The boy was sent sexually explicit comments by a man while playing on his Xbox (file picture) ‘I knew something was wrong because my son came out of his room when he heard me coming up and told me not to go in, not to go on the game. ‘The comments were made by this person thinking he was talking to a little girl and they get more and more vile as they go on. The father added: ‘He has Asperger’s so he doesn’t really understand the dangers. He thinks everyone’s his friend. 'I have explained it to him and the police spoke to him as well. But he doesn’t understand. He’s really upset at the moment because his “friend” might go to jail.’ The father, who is a former security worker, said: ‘You never think these things will happen to you. I knew I was opening myself up to criticism by telling people about it but I thought it was important to warn other parents.’ A Cleveland Police spokesman confirmed the force had received a report and that inquiries were ongoing. She also directed parents to a section on the force’s website on safe surfing.

"Britain's failure to prosecute Somali pirates who attack ships, seize hostages and demand huge ransoms ‘beggars belief’, a withering Parliamentary report said today. Nine out of ten piracy suspects detained by the Royal Navy and other maritime forces in the Gulf of Aden or Indian Ocean are released without trial, according to the Foreign Affairs Select Committee. Not one pirate has been brought to the UK for prosecution, even though 20 other countries - including the U.S., France, Germany and Belgium - had placed nearly 1,000 suspects on trial. Flashpoint: The 17,000-ton cargo ship Maersk Alabama, when it was operating under the name Maersk Alva, was ferrying much-needed food supplies to Uganda and Somalia when it was attacked by pirates . Most of the time armed bandits who prey on merchant ships off the volatile Horn of Africa are returned to their boats and freed. Ministers claim it is difficult to gather suitable evidence because pirates often threw weapons and other equipment into the sea when spotted by anti-piracy patrols. But the committee said the Navy should use photographs or video recordings to build a case against armed pirates. The report, published today said: ‘Gathering evidence to secure a successful prosecution for piracy is challenging. ‘However, not all claims made by the Government about the difficulty in securing evidence were wholly convincing: when pirates are observed in boats with guns, ladders and even hostages, it beggars belief that they cannot be prosecuted. ‘Simply returning suspected pirates to their boats or to land, while it may temporarily disrupt their activities, provides little long term deterrence and has demonstrably failed to prevent an annual increases in both the number of pirates going to sea and in the number of attacks.’ MPs on the cross-party committee launched their probe into piracy off the coast of Africa after a British couple were kidnapped by Somali pirates. Paul and Rachel Chandler, originally . from Kent but now living in Devon, were seized from their yacht Lynn . Rival near the Seychelles in 2009 and held in Somalia for a year, and . released only after a ransom of up to £620,000 was reportedly paid. Hostage: Paul and Rachel Chandler, who were kidnapped by Somali pirates in October 2009 . Seven of the pirates who allegedly held them hostage are currently being tried in Kenya for an attack on a French ship, and could then be extradited for trial in the UK. But despite the Metropolitan Police possessing ‘ample’ evidence the British Government is still ‘negotiating jurisdiction’, the report says. The failure to prosecute pirates drew stinging criticism from seafaring organisations. The London-based Chamber of Shipping trade association told the committee: ‘The repeated images of pirates being released without trial by naval forces, including the Royal Navy, causes understandable derision.’ And the Baltic Exchange, another maritime association based in London, said: ‘The UK has gained a degree of notoriety within the international shipping community for its failure to prosecute those caught red-handed in the act of piracy. ‘Once captured, pirates caught by UK forces are widely perceived simply to receive sustenance and medical assistance before being returned to the mainland unmolested.’ Unacceptable: Richard Ottaway, pictured says failure to put pirates in the dock must be addressed . The Government said the Royal Navy had transferred 28 pirates to other countries, including Kenya and the Seychelles, for prosecution since 2009. It had released 60 suspects held during boarding operations between April 2010 and November 2011. The 72-page report said the ‘plague’ of piracy was a ‘major concern’ that threatened the UK’s economy and security. The number of Somali pirate attacks has soared from 55 in 2007 to 219 in 2010. In that period some 3,500 seafarers have been held hostage, with 62 killed. And between January and March last year (2011) there was an all-time high 97 attacks by pirates against merchant ships - more than 1 a day. Experts estimate there are 3,000 pirates operating from war-torn Somalia who attack commercial vessels from small skiffs or larger ‘motherships’ using AK47 automatic rifles and rocket-propelled grenades. Last year ransom payments hit a record $135million (£86.5million) in 2011. The global cost of piracy is as much as $12billion (£7.5billion).Up to 200 vessels flying the red ensign - the British merchant navy flag - regularly sail close to Somalia. In October, Prime Minister David Cameron announced that Britain would lift the ban on armed guards being deployed on its merchant fleet. Branding piracy a ‘stain on our world’, he said security guards would have permission to ‘shoot to kill’ pirates attacking vessels for their valuable cargos and crews. The Foreign Affairs Committee welcomed the move but urged the Government to clarify when it is legal for British-flagged ships to shoot dead Somali pirates. It also raised the possibility of military personnel being placed on commercial vessels to protect them from pirates. Richard Ottaway, the committee’s Tory chairman, said: ‘The question anyone would ask is that if a private armed guard on board a UK-flagged vessel sees an armed skiff approaching at high speed, can the guard open fire? 'The Government must provide clearer direction on what is permissible and what is not. ‘It is unacceptable that 2.6 million square miles of the Indian Ocean has become a no-go area for small vessels, and a dangerous one for commercial shipping. 'There is a clear need to take decisive action.’ The committee also called on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to review its procedures for dealing with British captives’ families after the Chandlers criticised the department’s support during their 13-month ordeal as being limited to ‘tea and sympathy’.","Nine out of ten piracy suspects detained .

"A St Louis woman is going to prison after being sentenced Friday to 78 years for the 'systematic torture' of her children. Lakechia Schonta Stanley, 34, admitted to whipping, beating and waterboarding her three children and faced 34 felonies, including counts of assault and endangering the welfare of a child. The abuse came to light in October 2011, when Stanley's then-10-year-old daughter arrived at school with complaints of pain in her arm, reports the St Louis Post-Dispatch. Sentenced: Lakechia Schonta Stanley (left), 34, received 78 years in prison for the 'systematic torture' of her three children; her husband Alexander Rui Stanley (right), 30, was sentenced last year to 160 years over similar crimes . The girl told her school librarian her mother had beaten her with a bat as punishment for not promptly cleaning the kitchen. The librarian found the arm cold to the touch, and when the girl was later treated at the hospital, medical staff found that profound abuse had caused trauma that constricted blood supply to the arm. The girl also confided that her sister, 8, had been beaten with the baseball bat because she had spent too long in the shower. Prosecutors said that Stanley, who along with her husband, Alexander Rui Stanley, 30, had also whipped the girls with electrical cords, left profound physical injuries along with emotional trauma. 'The scarring on these two girls is the worst scarring I have ever seen on children from repeated whippings from objects,' Detective Robert Jauer wrote in a probable cause statement at the time. Prosecutors said that the children were subjected to other beatings and punishments, such as being forced into showers that were freezing or scalding hot, and being waterboarded. 'What the defendant did to three of her own children far exceeds the definition of child abuse and amounts to systematic torture,' wrote assistant circuit attorney Tanja Engelhardt to the judge. 'She was supposed to be their mother, the one person they could trust,' said Engelhardt in the sentencing memorandum. 'Instead she became a symbol of betrayal and fear, using every tool at her disposal to beat and torture her own innocent children.' Alexander Stanley pleaded guilty last year to 42 felony counts and was sentenced to 160 years in prison.","Lakechia Schonta Stanley, 34, admitted to abuse against her three children that amounted to 34 felony counts .

"Britain is handing out citizenship to more migrants than any other European Union country after an influx of foreigners lasting more than a decade. Almost a quarter of all new citizenships – which invariably pave the way to a British passport – were provided by the UK. Official figures published by Eurostat, the official statistics organisation of the European Commission, showed this country gave citizenship to 193,900 people in 2012. Official figures published yesterday showed the UK gave citizenship – which invariably paves the way to a British passport – to 193,900 people . At 23.7 per cent, that was the highest proportion of almost 820,000 foreigners given citizenship by any of the 28 EU nations. Migrants from India headed the list of those granted a UK passport, with 14.6 per cent. This was followed by Pakistan (9.5 per cent), Nigeria (4.6 per cent) and the Philippines (4.2 per cent). But around 10,500 people from other EU countries also claimed citizenship – around 1 in 20 – suggesting many who arrived from Eastern Europe after restrictions were lifted in 2004 want to set up home . Germany granted the second highest number of new citizenships with 114,000, followed by France on 96,000. In total, more than 2.1million people from overseas have been given British citizenship since the turn of the century as those who arrived during the biggest wave of migration in history decided to settle. The figures will fuel concerns at the scale of immigration as the Tories and Labour attempt to tackle the ballooning popularity of Ukip. Nigel Farage’s anti-Europe party is expected to sweep to victory in today’s Rochester and Strood by-election, claiming its second Westminster seat, on the back of voters’ worries about the pressure migration is placing on public services and jobs. It was 23.7 per cent – the highest proportion of almost 820,000 foreigners given citizenship by any of the 28 EU nations in 2012 . Yesterday, a separate report by the British Future think-tank said a ‘shocking’ 25 per cent of people surveyed wanted to send home all immigrants, whether legal or illegal. It also warned that liberal attacks accusing Ukip of racism may have strengthened support for the party by boosting its ‘outsider’ appeal. Commenting on Eurostat’s figures, Sir Andrew Green of the MigrationWatch UK think tank said: ‘Clearly, Britain remains the No1 EU destination for migrants from outside the EU. It is imperative we bear down on non-EU immigration while looking at ways of restricting the flow from the EU.’ Dr Carlos Vargas-Silva, deputy director of the Migration Observatory at Oxford University, said: ‘The UK is the leader in terms of people acquiring citizenship in the EU and one of the reasons this is happening is because of migration from the Commonwealth.’ Those applying for citizenship must have lived in the UK for at least five years. Separate Home Office figures have shown the number of migrants given citizenship jumped to 208,000 last year, with applications increasing as they dashed to get passports before new rules on English language skills were introduced.","Official figures published yesterday showed the UK gave citizenship – paving the way to a British passport – to 193,900 people .

"Agents from Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) have caught the woman suspected of producing child pornography and appearing to abuse a young child in a sex video she posted on the internet - less than 24 hours after the Feds appealed to the American public for help. Corrine Danielle Motley of Okaloosa County, Florida was arrested late Wednesday and faces federal charges for the production and distribution of child pornography. The 25-year-old was apprehended by Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force members and Homeland Security Investigations special agents. Arrested: Federal authorities have arrested 25-year-old Corine Danielle in Florida, on suspicion of producing child pornography . Tip: Agents said that after they asked the public for help, they were able to catch the woman in less than 24 hours . Suspect: According to her Facebook page the woman is married to Brandon (right) A Facebook page for the suspect shows that the woman is married to Brandon and in photos she poses with various young children. U.S. Immigration and Customs were alerted after a video appeared on the internet showing the woman engaging in explicit sex with a four to five-year-old victim. They issued an appeal on Wednesday morning for help in finding the woman in the footage, believed to have been uploaded on or around November 27. 'The quick identification of the victim and suspect in this case demonstrates the power of the press, social media and the general public in helping solve these cases,' John Morton, director of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE), told ABC News. 'Literally hours after we asked the public for their assistance in identifying Jane Doe, a tip came in that led to her identification and arrest. There is nothing more satisfying than knowing that, due to these efforts, a child is now safe and her tormentor now in custody.' She is being held without bond.

The woman was described as being of medium build with hazel or green eyes and brown hair with blond highlights. She has a mole on her left thigh and a tongue piercing with a white round stud with a pink dot. It is believed the video was made in the U.S. and that both victim and abuser are in the country. Investigators from Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) Homeland Security Investigation team received a tip-off about the film from Danish Police. A criminal complaint and arrest warrant has been issued in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Footage in which they appeared was submitted to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, the national clearinghouse for child sexual exploitation material. Anyone with information about the latest abuser or her victim should contact the agency immediately by calling the ICE Tip Line on 866-347-2423, which is staffed 24-hours a day, or filling out an on-line tip form at www.ice.gov.

"A new report has shown that Australia’s ecosystems and habitats are under threat, with 138 species residing on unprotected land. Among the list of  endangered animals are some of Australia’s most-loved creatures, including the Dawson Yellow Chat, the Northern Hairy-Nosed wombat and the Green Sawfish. According to the WWF’s most recent findings, 55 animals and 39 plant species are listed as already extinct on the national threatened species list and 1652 species are listed as threatened with extinction. The Green Sawfish was previously found asfar south as New South Wales waters but now only occurs north of Cairns across northern estuaries . The Yellow Chat has declined to only 200 birds in remnant populations. The Hairy-Nosed wombat previously inhabited  a vast space, reaching from central Queensland to the Victorian border. Now, just 126 wombats remain in central Queensland while only 100 were found in southern Queensland. The Northern Hairy-Nosed wombat is now reduced to just 126 individuals in the last remaining wild population on Epping Forest National Park in central Queensland and 12 recent colonistsat the Richard Underwood Nature Refuge in southern Queensland . The critically endangered health plant, The Northern Serrate Dryandra, occurs in just 16 populations in three location. Conservation group WWF has blasted the Government’s low-level investment in maintaining national reserve systems, considering nearly 8 per cent of all life on Earth are found in Australia. Despite the boost in national reserve funding from Caring for Our Country the Australian Government decided to discontinue its dedicated national reserve fund in late 2012. The Chat has declined to only 200birds in three remnant populations, and until recently largely unprotectedand subject to livestock use . The report states that this funding was ‘fundamental in driving significant strategic growth in Australia’s protected area estate.’ ‘It is highly unlikely Australia can achieve its long-standing commitments to an ecologically representative National Reserve System, and prevent major biodiversity loss, without this dedicated funding pool,’ the report continued. While the government has allocated a budget of $400 million per year over the next five years to the national reserve system, the WWF realistically believes a further $170 million per year until 2020 will be needed. The Major Mitchell's cockatoo is listed as threatened in NSW . The report states that ‘the total cost of Australia achieving a comprehensive, adequate and representative marine reserve system that would satisfy Aichi Target 11 is an estimated $247 million.’ Visitors to national parks and nature reserves spend over $23.6 billion a year in Australia every year, generating tax revenue for state and territory governments of $2.36 billion a year. The report believes that these economic benefits greatly exceed the annual protected area expansion and management spending by all Australian governments, estimated to be $1.28 billion a year. The Northern Serrate Dryandra occurs in just 16 populations in threelocations . ‘It is clear that Australian society is benefiting far greater than its governments’ investment into strategic growth and maintenance of the National Reserve System,’ the WWF states. 16.5 per cent of Australia’s land mass is under some sort of protection, with national parks making up 8.3% of this total. The WWF said in the report that the government should prohibit mining in areas placed under protection and create a network of reserves that protect biodiversity.","138 Australian species reside on unprotected land .

"The U.S. federal government spent more than $5.3 million that it shouldn't have on food stamps and other nutrition assistance programs during the 2014 fiscal year, according to an inspection report published this month. The spending, called 'improper payments' in government-speak, were totaled up through the end of August and accounted for 11 months of the fiscal year that concluded on September 30. The number is on pace to eclipse the total for 2013. The government defines 'improper payments' as disbursements 'made to an ineligible recipient, a payment for an ineligible good or service, or a payment for goods or services not received.' Most shocking in the November 7 audit was that more than one-fourth of the money spent by the National School Breakfast Program met that definition. The US Department of Agriculture pays out billions unnecessarily each year in one of the world's most sprawling food distribution schemes . Working poor: Food stamp benefits are paid by the states through federal block grants, installing added layers of bureaucracy that sometimes invite financial shenanigans . Nearly all of the 'improper' payments consisted of overpayments. A tiny proportion were underpayments. 'But those get corrected,' said a congressional legislative assistant who covers agriculture for a midwestern Republican House member. 'There's virtually no case where food vendors or truckers or dairymen just say, ""Okay, I'll accept less."" Those cases get sorted out,' he told MailOnline on Tuesday. 'But almost none of the overpayments get refunded to the taxpayer, and that's maddening.' The aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that food stamps will likely always be a source of wasteful spending, and Congress is too afraid of voter backlash from low-income Americans to tackle the problem. 'They could triple the national debt on these programs and it would still be impossible to challenge them,' he said. 'It's the third-rail of politics. Touch it and you get zapped.' Food-stamp benefit programs made $2.437 million in improper payments this year and serves more than 47 million Americans every month. Another $1.748 billion was misspent by the National School Lunch Program, amounting to more than one out of every seven dollars spent. Ch-ch-changes: First Lady Michelle Obama championed a school lunch requirement that lowered calories to just 850 and put other restrictions in place, and all schools that get federal assistance money are bound by it . Students in Oklahoma have taken to social media to blast Michelle Obama for the resulting lunches, and they're none too pleased . That program provides free or reduced-cost lunches to more than 30 million children during the school day. But the National School Breakfast Program took the gold medal for wastefulness, with an 'improper' payment rate of more than 25.61 per cent. That program spent $923 million it shouldn't have this year. Another $206 million in misspent money was identified in the Women, Infants, and Children nutrition program. The Child and Adult Care Food Program, a free snack and lunch service for day care centers, issued $10 million in improper payments. The Washington Free Beacon reported Tuesday that while the USDA's Food Nutrition Service oversees them all, it's also asking Congress to fund a substantial increase in salaried employees to keep them running. The FNS employs 1,359 full-time permanent workers; the USDA wants that total hiked to 1,600 in the coming year. Most of the increase, 333 new positions, would go to the food stamp system, officially called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.","'They could triple the national debt on these programs and it would still be impossible to challenge them,' complains a Republican congressional aide .

"Walking children to school can help them perform better when they get there - and the benefits are especially clear for those with ADHD, a new study says . Walking to school helps children concentrate in lessons better and may even reduce the need for medication for conditions like ADHD, new research suggests. A survey of more than 2,500 pupils showed that 80 per cent of those who walked to school reported feeling calmer and more able to concentrate when they got there.  They also said they felt healthier and looked better. The survey was carried out by Henley-based health technology company Intelligent Health, which said that the link between exercise and school performance would also benefit children suffering from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The firm's founder William Bird said: 'Physical activity improves brain elasticity, which allows children to learn. 'Exercise also releases endorphins, which make you more relaxed.' He told the Daily Telegraph that research in America, where children with ADHD are encouraged to play in parks, has shown such a calming effect from exercise that children were 'almost back to normal'. ADHD is one of the most common childhood disorders, whose common symptoms include a short attention span, restlessness, and difficulty controlling behaviour. Drugs such as Ritalin are prescribed to help control the symptoms and NHS prescriptions for them have doubled in England in the last six years - last year there were 657,000 NHS prescriptions for ADHD drugs, and nearly 5,000 private prescriptions. Health watchdog the Care Quality Commission said the number of prescriptions rose by 11 per cent just from 2011 to 2012, and medications to help sufferers of ADHD are now said to cost the NHS £31m a year. Mother-of-three Emily Parker, 39, of Hammersmith, takes her children to school on foot, covering a mile each way every day. She said: 'I started noticing that on the days we did walk to school, rather than drive, the children had much better days.  They behaved better, ate better, and even slept better when they came home. Drugs: NHS prescriptions for ADHD methylphenidate drugs like Ritalin, pictured, have doubled in six years . 'Now we do it every day unless the weather is awful - I have no doubt there's a link between exercise and doing better at school.' Other benefits reported by the children who took part in the survey included making new friends.  However only three in 10 teachers agreed that walking helped children to learn more. Psychologist Oliver James said: 'I'm all in favour of children walkign to school but ADHD is best understood as a form of anxious attachment, not something caused by lack of exercise.'","Survey of 2,500 children shows 80 per cent reported better work at school .

"A father-of-two was killed in a . horrifying accident when a giant inflatable ball in which he and another . man were rolling down a mountain plunged off a cliff at a ski-resort in . southern Russia. Denis Burakov, 27, married with two young daughters, broke his neck and spine in the zorbing accident, say reports.

Denis Burakov, 27, was killed in a horrifying accident when a giant inflatable ball in which he and another man were rolling down a mountain plunged off a cliff.  Pictured: Mr  Burakov with his two daughters and his wife . Tragic accident: One of the zorbing operators holds the sphere securely as the path it is meant to travel down stretches out ahead . The so-called 'orb' was supposed to . come to a halt at the bottom of a gentle snowy piste, designed for the sport, which originates in New Zealand. But in a terrifying accident filmed by the victim's friends, it lurched first to the right and then to the left. As he got into the giant ball, an . unnamed friend - who filmed the horror - is heard saying: 'Denis, you'll . be like Jackie Chan in the Armour of God movie!' Unknown to come: The pair set off on their journey as they are rolled down the slope by the operators . Bouncing ride: The giant sphere bounces down the path as the pair spin around while harnessed into place . An instructor is asked how far the . 'orb' can go, replying 'not that far' and explaining there was a man . lower down the mountain ready to catch it if it went off track. But as it is pushed down the slope, a man's voice is heard saying: 'Oh f***, it's gone in the wrong direction again.' Suddenly the male voice screams:  'Hold it, hold it! Hold!'  Then he says: 'Ah well, it's OK, it'll stop by itself.' The ball crashes through rocks and teeters on the edge of ravine - before disappearing from view, over the cliff. Uncontrollable: The ball rolls to the bottom of the hill where people are waiting, but then suddenly veers off to left . Panic: As the massive sphere rolls across the path a figure can be seen desperately chasing after it . Desperate: When the ball rolls over the side of the slope it starts to gather momentum and turns . The friend filming the death ride plunge asks: 'What's going on there?' The voice replies: 'Nothing.' But then calmly adds: 'A catastrophe.'  At this the footage stops. At terrifying speed, the ball had . plunged down Ganachhirskiy Gorge in the Dombai resort complex in . Russia's North Caucasus mountain range. Falling steeply and battered by rocks, it was pulled down relentlessly by gravity. 'The orb went on for about one and a . half kilometres, jumping on the rocks and hitting them,' said anaide to . local police commander Sergei Shuvayev . It came to rest on a frozen lake called Peacock's Eye. Surrounded by thick woodland it took . rescuers an agonising long time to reach the stricken men, and drag the . orb onto firm ground. When they got there, Mr Burakov from . Pyatigorsk,  was still alive but he died on the way to hospital on the . day of the incident, 3 January. Speed: Although the ball slows at a bump - it is not clear from the video which it is - it then tips over and speeds up . Fatal: In the final shot of the terrifying video the ball can be seen spinning out of control down a steep incline . His companion survived.  'He was extremely lucky to get away so lightly,' said a local report. 'As for whatever they felt falling . down the slope it is hard even to imagine. Some compare the pressure to . what cosmonauts feel,' said the Stavropol edition of Komsomolskaya . Pravda newspaper. A probe has been opened into criminal negligence causing death on the part of the extreme sports organisers. The maximum penalty is ten years in prison.

Astonishingly there were no barriers to prevent the out of control orb rolling relentlessly down the mountain. Friends said that he had gone on a ski-ing holiday following the New Year. 'He became intrigued about the orb . and the man said the trips were only 300 roubles - and that it was great . fun,' said an onlooker. 'Denis was known to love extreme adventures,' said a friend.

"They are, of course, there to help raise money for charity. But some of the stars of this year’s Children in Need have been accused of also using it as a convenient opportunity to raise their own profiles. Viewers have criticised a string of singers for ‘shamelessly’ promoting their albums and tour dates during the BBC1 fundraising appeal last Friday. The programme was watched by 8.3 million and raised a record £32.6 million for disadvantaged children and young adults. Scroll down for video . Viewers have criticised a string of singers, including Cheryl Fernandez-Versini (pictureD) for ‘shamelessly’ promoting their albums and tour dates during the BBC1 fundraising appeal last Friday . It featured performances by One Direction, Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, Katherine Jenkins and the recently reformed pop group S Club 7 – all of whom have new singles, albums or tours to promote. The musicians’ appearances prompted derision online, with viewers accusing them of hiding their self-promotion ‘behind a veil of charity’. Mrs Fernandez-Versini, 31, performed her new single Only Human, while One Direction performed Night Changes, released that very evening. One Twitter user wrote: ‘One Direction using Children In Need as a shameless plug for their new single #ShameOnYou.’ Miss Jenkins, 34, sang a track from her new album Home Sweet Home. Two days after their Children in Need appearance, the seven S Club 7 band members (pictured) announced a comeback arena tour that will take place next year . She also used a pre-performance interview to plug the record, gushing: ‘It’s my tenth album. I’ve no idea where the time’s gone and why I’ve been lucky enough to make ten. 'It’s kind of like a full circle - it is paying tribute to Wales but also going back to my classical roots.’ Gary Raymond tweeted: ‘Nice to see Katherine Jenkins taking a moment on Children in Need there to plug her new album #classy.’ Another primetime spot went to Noughties pop act S Club 7, who reunited to perform a medley of their greatest hits. Katherine Jenkins, 34, sang a track from her new album Home Sweet Home . Two days after their Children in Need appearance, the seven band members, including former Strictly Come Dancing star Rachel Stevens, 36, announced a comeback arena tour that will take place next year. Dan Cooper wrote online: ‘This is why I hate Children in Need. S Club 7 hiding behind a veil of charity to shamelessly expose and promote themselves for a tour.’ It wasn’t just the singers who were accused of underhanded tactics, either – for one of the night’s presenters came under fire, too. EastEnders actor Shane Richie was accused of using his influence to promote his son Jake Roche’s band Rixton. The group performed their new song Wait On Me on Friday, prompting one viewer to tweet: ‘Thought Children in Need was about raising money for children’s charities, not an excuse for Shane Ritchie to plug his son’s band!!!’ Deirdre Halliwell asked: ‘Is there anyone on Children in Need this year who isn’t promoting something?’ A third viewer suggested that the charity drive was now an event ‘when all the “generous pop bands” give up their time to shamelessly plug their latest records’. A BBC spokesman said: ‘We are incredibly grateful to all the celebrities who took part in Friday’s show, giving their time for free to help raise millions of pounds for disadvantaged children across the UK. ‘This year’s night of fundraising raised a record-breaking £32.6 million; everyone who played their part should be proud knowing that they have made a difference.’","Viewers criticised singers for 'shamelessly' promoting albums and tours .

"Legendary society photographer Cecil Beaton loathed Taylor's 'crassness' Photo kept in private collection of Beaton's friend now set to fetch £12k at auction . A photo of Elizabeth Taylor taken by Cecil Beaton has emerged after nearly 40 years after being kept in a private collection. But surfacing along with the image is the revelation that society photographer Beaton loathed the 'monster' that was Elizabeth Taylor, and called both the star and her husband 'vulgar, common and crass'. Despite his utter contempt for the late actress, the famed society photographer nonetheless captured Taylor in her prime, allowing her natural beauty shining through. 'Vulgar, common and crass': Cecil Beaton loathed what he called the 'monster' that was Elizabeth Taylor, but was forced to photograph the then 39-year-old star with husband Richard Burton at a black tie event in 1971 . The black and white shot was taken by Beaton at a lavish black-tie ball in 1971 at which he was commissioned to snap the rich and famous guests. Taylor, then aged 39, was pictured with her fifth husband Richard Burton. She was captured wearing a couture Valentino dress with a Van Cleef and Arpels necklace entwined in her hair. A short time later Beaton gave the photograph as a gift to friend Brian Hammond, who owned the famous Gerry's Club in London's Soho. The framed picture hung in his club up until he died earlier this year. His family, who have inherited the image, are now selling it at auction in London where it is expected to sell for £12,000. Sarah Wheeler, a specialist in the photographs section of Bloomsbury Auctions, said: 'The fact that Cecil Beaton produced such a beautiful portrait despite his personal dislike for them, shows what a consummate professional he was.' 'This photograph has never been sold at auction before and had been in private ownership for more than 30 years. 'It is a beautiful portrait of her.' In Beaton's diaries that were later published, he wrote a damning opinion of Taylor and Burton following the brief photoshoot. Damning: Beaton said Taylor 'combined the worst of U.S. and English taste' while Burton was 'as butch and coarse as only a Welshman can be . He wrote: 'I have always loathed the Burtons for their vulgarity, commonness and crass bad taste, she combining the worst of U.S. and English taste, he as butch and coarse as only a Welshman can be. 'She wanted compliments. She got none. I felt I must be professional and continued, but not without loathing at this monster. 'Round her neck was a velvet ribbon with the biggest diamond in the world pinned on it. On her fat, coarse hands more of the biggest diamonds and emeralds, her head a ridiculous mass of diamond necklaces, sewn together, with a snood of blue and black pom-poms and black aisprey aigrettes. Scathing: Cecil Beaton was passionate in his hatred of Taylor and Burton . 'Sausage curls! Alexandre, the hairdresser, had done his worst. And this was the world's biggest draw! In comparison everyone else looked ladylike.' Beaton, who died in 1980, set up his own studio for the Rothschilds' Proust Ball held at the Chateau de Ferriere near Paris in December 1971. He dressed himself up as the 19th century French photographer Felix Nadar while he took his pictures of the great and the good of the day. Miss Wheeler said: 'Cecil Beaton was the only photographer there. 'He took one picture of Elizabeth Taylor by herself which sold at last year's Elizabeth Taylor auction for £31,000. 'This one for sale is of her and her then husband Richard Burton. 'The couple pose as actors showing off their best features although they are looking away from each other, her towards the camera, while he looks on ahead, adding to the fascination of the image. 'Their costume including their hair, is extremely different from the costume worn for the parts they played in Under Milk Wood which they filmed together earlier that year in a small Welsh fishing village. 'The photo was given by Cecil Beaton to the late Brian Hammond and it is his relatives who are selling it. 'It has been signed by Beaton in red pencil.' The auction takes place in London next Tuesday.","Legendary society photographer Cecil Beaton loathed Taylor's 'crassness'

"Bad steer: Robin Lovelock, 65, spent four years building Snoopy Sloop and hoped it would be the first vessel to complete a 3,600-mile journey unaided . A retired scientist spent four years building a toy boat he hoped would be the first to cross the Atlantic unaided - only to see it crash after six miles. Robin Lovelock, 65, waded into the sea in his trousers to launch Snoopy Sloop from Barton-on-Sea, Hants, on a 3,600-mile journey to the U.S. But the four-foot vessel sailed just six miles in seven hours before crashing into the Needles off the western tip of the Isle of Wight. The 30lb boat, which has a top speed of just three knots, was constructed for . less than £450 in Mr Lovelock's games room in Sunninghill, Berkshire. It features solar panels on the deck that power a GPS receiver, a small computer, and a turbo, which control the metre-high sails and rudder. Mr Lovelock tracked the journey on the internet from a laptop after his boat set sail at 11.30am, but watched in horror as winds carried the boat straight into the rocks. He then lost contact with Snoopy Sloop at 6.45pm after the motion of the waves repeatedly bashed it against the rocks, breaking the onboard GPS. The former senior scientist for NATO now hopes a member of the public will be able to rescue the boat so he can try again. He said: 'It was always going to be tough so I am not too downhearted. 'Hopefully somebody will find Snoopy and return her to us so we can give her a quick dusting down and send her back on her way. 'She made good progress for the first two hours but then we noticed she was heading straight for the Needles, where she is wrecked. 'The repeated bashing against the rocks has unfortunately broken the GPS receiver. It’s possible water has got on board.' Seafaring adventure: The 1.3-metre boat only managed seven hours before crashing into the Needles off the western tip of the Isle of Wight . Tiny craft: The 30lb boat, which has a top speed of just three knots, was constructed for less than £450 in Mr Lovelock's games room . He added: 'If we had launched her just a few hundred yards further west or half an hour earlier she would have probably missed the Needles and be well on her way now.' If the boat had survived the six-month journey to Maine, it would have been the first robotic boat to complete the transatlantic trip. The technology should have worked to keep the 10kg boat on a a pre-defined route, mapped out by Mr Lovelock. He started work on his project four years ago, assisted by six friends called the Last of the Summer Wine Team, one of whom appeared on BBC programme Robot Wars. Challenge: The 65-year-old had hoped to make history by building the first unmanned vessel to cross the Atlantic . Labour of love: Mr Lovelock has spent four years crafting the four foot boat at a cost of around £450 . The boat has previously already sailed 5,000 miles, albeit in the comparatively still waters of Bray Lake near Windsor. He said before the launch: 'It will be a tough trip with lots of obstacles to trip us up along the way. 'The boat will have to negotiate large waves, strong winds and even curious dolphins. 'However, our research and testing will hopefully give us a fighting chance.' Mr Lovelock made prototypes using items he had bought on auction website eBay. A model of cartoon character Snoopy was fitted to the front of the boat. Resilient: Robin's craft has already sailed around 5,000 miles, albeit on the still waters of Bray Lake near Windsor . Construction: Robin has been helped by a team of friends, including a veteran of BBC's Robot Wars . It was due to head west along the English Channel from the Hampshire coastline, south towards the Azores to catch the trade winds, then to the Bahamas and on to the USA. A team from Aberystwyth University . attempted the first transatlantic crossing in September 2010 setting . sail from Valentia, County Kerry, Ireland. But the team lost its track of the craft off the north west coast of Ireland. The challenge has been attempted three times since 2010, with all three attempts failing. Three more attempts have been registered for this year.","Robin Lovelock, 65, hoped to sail his four foot long boat 3,600 miles to American shores .

"A lawyer battling sexual harassment in the workplace has revealed how strippers and brothels have cost Australian companies millions. Executives are being forced to cough up cash to female employees after using seedy corporate entertainment in scenes like something out of The Wolf Of Wall Street, lawyer Michael Harmer revealed. Female employees are suing bosses for having to endure a culture where harassment and discrimination is commonplace. Australian companies are using seedy entertainment in scenes like something out of Wall Of Wall Street . Mr Harmer, known in court as The Undertaker, has blasted the employers he has so far bought cases against. He claimed companies have paid from $1million to $3.5million in out of court settlements in sexual harassment cases to keep their reputations intact. Harmer, who is responsible for bringing the largest sex discrimination claim in Australian history - Christina Rich v Pricewaterhouse-Coopers - said he 'objects' to the crude practices used in the legal, accounting, finance and property industries. ‘Where alcohol and the degradation of women is used as entertainment, you can get an overstepping of the mark by either other employees or clients,’ he told the Financial Review. In the interview he described how he’d heard of a global chairman charging brothels to his corporate credit card. Mr Harmer claimed companies have paid from $1million to $3.5million in out of court settlements in sexual harassment cases to keep their reputations intact after using strippers and brothels . Lawyer Michael Harmer is responsible for winning the largest sex discrimination claim in Australian history . In the landmark Christina Rich v Pricewaterhouse-Coopers case, Ms Rich received an out of court settlement in 2008 believed to be worth about $5million to $6million, plus legal costs, from the firm that she said was blighted with a 'boys' club' culture of harassment. PwC has always denied the claims. Mr Harmer's colleague Joydeep Hor, former managing partner of Harmers Workplace Lawyers, said at the time that many such cases were never revealed in public. 'It's a shame the public, the employers don't see the case,' he said. 'Most of my clients are employers - they don't appreciate the significance of these issues until they have been burnt.' Harmers Workplace Lawyers, which supplies psychological help for its clients, also previously acted for Kristy Fraser-Kirk. The 25-year-old woman’s sexual harassment complaint against David Jones chief executive Mark McInnes triggered his shock resignation and a confession of ‘unbecoming’ conduct. Her $37 million lawsuit against David Jones, its McInnes and nine directors of the retailer was settled for $850,000, including a 'smaller' contribution from Mr McInnes. Meanwhile, Federal Sex Discrimination Commissioner Elizabeth Broderick told the Financial Review how she had been contacted by concerned women who worked in the mining industry. Mr Harmer described how he'd heard of a global chairman charging brothels to his corporate credit card . Last year a West Australian mayor said mining towns across the state are trying to distance themselves from a reputation of a heavy drinking culture and topless barmaids . They were scheduled to attend the annual ‘Diggers and Dealers’ conference where a delegation of mining and exploration companies, brokers, bankers, gather in the unofficial gold capital of Australia, Kalgoorlie, WA. In 2013 a West Australian mayor said mining towns across the state are trying to distance themselves from their association with topless barmaids. However, he spoke to the ABC in the same week that a WA pub was fined after a 'skimpy' barmaid appeared completely naked. In the Martin Scorsese film The Wolf of Wall Street, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, penny stockbrokers in the 1980s and 1990s are seen binging on women. There is an orgy scene on the trading floor, amongst other outrageous incidents.","Lawyer Michael Harmer said many employers are settling expensive sexual harassment claims out of court as female employees fight back .

"When twins Charlotte Eisgrou and Ann Primack were born Edward VII was still on the British throne, the South Pole still had not been conquered and the old age pension had only just been introduced. But despite being the world's oldest living identical twins, the 103-year-olds are proud to say they still have all their 'faculties'. The pair, who celebrated their birthday on Christmas Eve, also still have their own teeth, do not use a hearing aid and do not even need reading glasses. Still going strong: Charlotte Eisgrou, left, and Ann Primack celebrated their 103rd birthday on Christmas Eve . The pair, who could not spend their big day together because they recently suffered falls, love to re-live the many practical jokes they have played over the years. Mrs Primack, who lives in South Florida, said when she would visit her sister in Daytona Beach the pair would switch husbands as they walked into the local synagogue. She told the Daytona Beach News Journal: 'And they'd say to me ""Charlotte, you look so good.""' The twins' great age is even more remarkable as they were born premature, weighing a combined 7lbs. The doctor kept them warm by wrapping them in hot blankets and placing them on the open door of a stove as it was before the days of incubators. They were born in Chicago before moving to Florida where they both enjoyed long marriages and have one living son each. The pair, pictured on their 100th birthday, are the world's oldest living identical twins . The sisters have always been close and talk to one another almost daily but they do not agree on the secret behind their long life. Mrs Primack credits genes and 'never being fat' while her twin Mrs Eisgrou said it is down to drinking lots of milk. But Mrs Eisgrou, who admits to being the more outspoken of the two sisters, said: 'I don't know the secret to a long life. And I wouldn't tell you if I knew it.' Despite their age Mrs Eisgrou said she did not plan a big birthday party but concedes their family would be happy to know they have lived so long. She said: 'Who would have thunk it? My father would have danced in the air. He'd be so happy.' They are the second oldest twins in the world, born 39 days after non-identical twins Edith Ritchie and Evelyn Middleton from Aberdeenshire, in Scotland.","Charlotte Eisgrou and Ann Primack say secret to long life is drinking milk and never being fat .

"Britain's villages are under attack from predatory developers exploiting relaxed planning laws, the ‘countryside bible’ is warning. Country Life magazine says rural communities are being ruined by house builders ‘let off the leash’ by David Cameron. As a result, large estates are being built on the outskirts of villages, leaving residents with overcrowded schools and over-subscribed GP surgeries. Those who try to defend themselves from ‘ugly, poorly conceived housing sprawl’ are dismissed as Nimbys (not in my back yard), says the magazine. Scroll down for video . Locals claim the Hertfordshire village of Buntingford has become a ‘dumping ground’ for Londoners priced out of the capital. Planning permission for 1,000 houses has already been granted. And further applications and appeals could add several hundred more, potentially doubling the village’s size. Residents say there is insufficient infrastructure to support such rapid expansion, with schools and doctors’ surgeries already full. ‘All you can hear is construction vehicles. They carry on up and down all day long, every day,’ said barmaid Charlotte Shaw, 21. ‘Families are going to move here with their kids who need schools and will need doctors when they get ill. But they don’t seem to be thinking about the infrastructure.’ Toby Archer, 46, who runs the Cheese Plate shop and is chairman of Buntingford Chamber of Commerce, said: ‘We are just being shafted by the local council. 'A district plan should have been in place but until then it is carte blanche for developers. 'We were told to expect 500 houses, but now we are getting 1,500. We have become a dumping ground for Londoners.’ The article, by editor-at-large Clive Aslet, follows a strong denunciation of how politicians were ruining the countryside by Sir Simon Jenkins, the chairman of the National Trust in Saturday’s Daily Mail. Mr Aslet says the countryside has been ‘stripped of its natural defences’ leading to ‘a rash of ill-considered housing’. He points the finger at the National Planning Policy Framework which the Government introduced two years ago to boost development and tackle the housing crisis by cutting red tape. The guidelines said councils which had not earmarked suitable land to meet housing demand over the next five years must adopt a presumption in favour of planning permission. Mr Aslet said Buntingford in Hertfordshire, Leintwardine in Herefordshire, and Castle Cary in Somerset are among communities whose character is most at risk from developers. Leintwardine faces three separate applications to build around its borders, adding to the two estates already there. Under threat: Locals in Buntingford say housing will put a strain on nurseries and GPs, but fear being dismissed as Nimbys for complaining . Moving in: Residents complain that their village has become a dumping ground for Londoners priced out of living in the capital . In Castle Cary, four housing developments are under consideration. And in Buntingford, residents face the prospect of 1,000 new homes for which there is ‘insufficient infrastructure’. If approved, its population will have doubled since 2011. Opponents of the expansion claim the average waiting time for a doctor’s appointment is already up to three weeks and the schools are full. Mr Aslet said that while farmland was once protected and rural areas kept ‘mostly green’, the balance had changed with the introduction of the new guidelines. Councils must now create local plans identifying land for housing. ‘Those who can’t are naked in the face of predatory developers’, he said. ‘Communities that don’t have local plans in place are similarly meat for the wolves. ‘The threat of appeal, with all the associated costs, is cowing some local authorities into granting applications that they would like to refuse. Leintwardine, Castle Cary and Buntingford are being transformed without any vision beyond Treasury diktat and developers’ greed. Founded by the Romans, the Herefordshire village of Leintwardine has hardly expanded since, but now developers have lodged three applications that would double its size. Alison Kay, chairman of Leintwardine parish council, insists they are not Nimbys. ‘We aren’t against development,’ she said. 'There’s a need for more bungalows for old people and self-build homes for young families.' But schools are at capacity and the country lanes cannot take any more traffic. Barman John Ball, 74, said: ‘The land they want to build on is boggy and the road is far too narrow and you cannot widen it. There will be sewage problems too. ‘There is no work around here. There is no transport so people are going to have to have cars. It will certainly put a strain on the amenities here.’ ‘Many of the ills associated with volume house building result from developers’ short-term involvement with the sites. ‘After the houses are sold, they walk away, without further thought for the viability or attractiveness of what they’ve built.’ Yesterday, charities supported the claims and said the Government’s planning framework had left many rural communities powerless to resist major developments. According to The Campaign to Protect Rural England, planning permission has been given for 27,000 houses on greenfield sites against the wishes of local authorities in the past two years. Traditional: Leintwardine has hardly expanded since being founded by the Romans but could double in size thanks to planning applications . No plan: Villagers say they would like new housing but that the new developments have been poorly thought out and will cause problems . Even where councils have identified land for housing, some developers still apply to build on more desirable sites. The CPRE said house builders were targeting villages on the outskirts of national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty which were not protected from development. Paul Miner said: ‘They know they can sell the houses quickly and for a high price. ‘Some councils still have no local plans in place so they have to adopt a presumption in favour of planning permission, even on greenbelt land. ‘Even where councils have got a local plan, developers are appealing to the Planning Inspectorate if they are refused – and one in six of these appeals are then approved.’ Sarah Lee, of the Countryside Alliance, said the need to build more homes in rural areas was accepted, but such developments must be done ‘sensitively’. Residents in Castle Cary are scared that a huge development ‘plonked on the outside’ of their idyllic market town will end up destroying it. If applications for four new housing estates are approved the Somerset town’s population could soar by 40 per cent. Locals fear a large supermarket would be built to serve the 400 homes, destroying the character of Castle Cary’s quaint high street. Pek Peppin, planning chairman for the town council, said: ‘At the moment there seems to be applications coming in on a weekly basis. ‘The town has a very small population. One of the main problems is that we have very poor road structure – little more than country lanes. ‘If we got a high number of new houses built the roads will become absolutely impossible.’ ‘If we do not build more housing for young families then rural communities will wither. It would be naive to think otherwise,’ she said. ‘However, it must be done in an organic way and in keeping with the community rather than parachuting 2,000 houses on to the edge of a village. 'The danger is that you lose the character of that community.’ Pressure to meet the Government’s housebuilding targets meant some councils had not planned properly how this should be achieved, she said. However, planning minister Brandon Lewis last night insisted the Government had put countryside protection at the heart of planning reforms and said Country Life’s claims were ‘simply not true’.

Supermarket sweep: Those living in Castle Cary fear a large shopping centre could be built to cater for new arrivals, wrecking their high street . ‘We have put strong protections in place for the Green Belt, so it can continue to offer a strong defence against urban sprawl,’ he said. ‘Local plans mean local people can now decide where development should and shouldn’t go.’ He said the Government was building homes to help ‘first time buyers onto the property ladder’ but still recognised the ‘importance of protecting the environment and our countryside and favouring brownfield sites for development’. The Government has said that by 2020 it hopes more than 90 per cent of brownfield land suitable for housing will have planning permission for new homes.

"You might think it was a feat only achievable in the world of cartoons. But that didn't stop one pair setting themselves the challenge of going on all 46 rides at Disney World in just one day. And after running a total of 22 miles across all four parks in a frantic 17-hour dash, Shane Lindsay and Ted Tamburo, 46, can now celebrate the fulfilment of a childhood dream. Mr Lindsay, 41, said: 'It's not like we're solving world hunger, but it's fun to have a little challenge that no-one has ever done before and people think is impossible.' Shane Lindsay (left) and Ted Tamburo (right) went on all 46 rides in Disney World in one day . The pair met 20 years ago on a chat room dedicated to theme parks after revealing to each other that they both would visit Disney World every year as children, reports the New York Daily News. They came up with the idea for the challenge after Mr Lindsay mentioned that he would often only have one day to visit the park, meaning he would try to fit in as many rides as possible. Remarkably, the pair only met for the first time last year when they tried the attempt for the first time. But bad weather meant three of the attractions - Tomorrowland, Speedway and Astro Orbiter - were closed by the end of the day. They planned their second - and successful - attempt on November 7 and documented their exploits on their website. Cinderella Castle in the Magic Kingdom, one of the four parks the pair dashed across to take all the rides . The Dumbo attraction was one of the 46 rides the pair rode to complete their epic 17-hour challenge . After meticulous planning and armed FastPass tickets to skip the longer queues, they began they adventure at the Hollywood Studios at 8am. They then also took all the open rides at the three other parks - Epcot, Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom - with 15 minutes to spare before the site closed at 1am. With the spare time, they chose to cap it all off by re-visiting four of the rides to finish with a round 50 for good measure. 'If you're an average guest here on vacation this is not something you want to be doing,' Lindsay told CNN. 'It's very much like running a marathon throughout the day.' Hollywood Studios .

"Baroness Sandip Verma (pictured) said that the rate of global warming might have decreased, and that this could support the effectiveness of green policies . Government environmental measures may already have helped to slow down global warming, an energy minister has claimed. Baroness Sandip Verma said the rate of warming might have decreased, which could support the effectiveness of green policies. Her comments came as Viscount Ridley, a Conservative peer and critic of government efforts to stop temperature rises, questioned her on when warming would start again. He told peers at question time in the House of Lords: 'The fifth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change has confirmed in the same words that there has been a hiatus in global warming for at least the last 15 years.' And he asked Lady Verma: 'Would you give us the opinion of your scientific advisers as to when this hiatus is likely to end?' Lady Verma told him: 'You raise a couple of issues that we would dispute in a longer debate, but what we do recognise is that there a change in weather patterns happening across the globe, that climate change is occurring. 'It may have slowed down, but that is a good thing. It could well be that some of the measures we are taking today is helping that to occur.' For Labour, Baroness Bryony Worthington said the fifth report would be published on Friday. In April, the IPCC said it is '95 per cent' certain that climate change is man made, but still could not explain why the world has barely got any hotter in the last 15 years. The IPCC report said that sea levels have risen by seven inches (19cm) since 1901 and are expected to rise a further 10 to 32 inches (26 to 82cm) by the end of the century. It added that concentrations of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have increased to levels that are unprecedented in at least 800,000 years. But the landmark report conceded that world temperatures have barely risen in the past 15 years, despite growing amounts of greenhouse gases being pumped into the atmosphere. In April, the IPCC said it is '95 per cent' certain that climate change is man made, but still could not explain why the world has barely got any hotter in the last 15 years. During today's House of Lords session, Baroness Bryony Worthington said the fifth assessment report on this research would be published on Friday . Independent research similarly found that there has been little increase in the average temperature of the Earth’s surface since the turn of the century. Previous studies claimed this hiatus has lasted for 15 years, but Professor Ross McKitrick from University of Guelph believes temperatures have remained constant since 1995 . '[The fifth report] is likely to say yet again that there is incontrovertible proof now that climate change is a serious issue and we all must take notice of that,' Baroness Worthington added. She asked Lady Verma: 'Would you accept that Friday might be a good opportunity to point that out to some of the backbenchers in your party.' Lady Verma replied: 'It isn't just about backbenchers on my side. I think it is about making sure we deliver an informed debate and perhaps, thus far, that debate hasn't really taken place.' Independent research recently discovered that, since the turn of the century, there has been little increase in the average temperature of the Earth’s surface. WHAT IS THE IPCC? A scientific body with 195 member countries. The panel was established by the UN in 1988 to assess the causes and impacts of climate change. Since then, it has released four assessments, each stating the human link to global warming with more certainty than the previous one. The IPCC doesn't conduct its own research, but appoints hundreds of experts to review and summarise the latest scientific studies on climate change. It is headed by Rajendra Pachauri, a scientist from India. WHAT IS THE REPORT FOR? The report forms the scientific basis for U.N. negotiations aimed at curbing global warming. It will be a reference point for governments as they negotiate a new global climate agreement, which is supposed to be adopted by 2015 and to take effect in 2020. WHY HAS THE IPCC COME UNDER CRITICISM? It has been argued that the IPCC process is so time-consuming and laborious that by the time the assessments are published they are already out of date. A series of errors embarrassed the authors of the 2007 assessment, including the incorrect statement that the glaciers in the Himalayas would disappear by 2035. There has also been criticism about the IPCC's lack of openness. Previous studies claimed this hiatus has lasted for 15 years, but new research believes the temperature has remained almost constant since 1995. The conclusions were made by an economics professor Ross McKitrick from the University of Guelph in Canada who studied average land and ocean temperatures from the Hadcrut4 temperature series, dating back to 1850. Hadcrut4 is a monthly record of temperature readings created by the Hadley Centre of the UK Met Office, and the University of East Anglia’s Climatic Research Unit. It combines sea surface temperatures with land surface air temperatures into a grid that shows variations and anomalies. Professor McKitrick also compared these readings to those taken by the Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) satellite, which has measured upper air temperatures since 1979. In both datasets, he noticed a period where the line levelled off, from around 1990.","Baroness Sandip Verma made the claims during a session in House of Lords .

"Anti-terrorism officers are grilling a man accused of planning to blow up the Olympic Park during the Games using a car filled with explosives. Specialist police from London are in Blackpool, Lancashire, to speak to Javed Aktar who has been charged with making the deadly threat. He is one of more than a dozen suspected terrorists arrested in the last week as security services try to 'clear the decks' before the Olympics start later this month. Allegations: Javed Aktar, 42, has been charged with hatching a plot to blow up the Olympic Park . Britain's top expert on terrorism legislation, David Anderson QC, also said police and MI5 are 'defending further up the field' to avoid any 7/7 or 9/11-style attacks when London hosts the Games. 42-year-old Aktar is currently being held in custody and will appear before magistrates in Blackpool on Friday. He has been charged with leading another person into believing that he had explosives, namely Semtex, in Blackpool with intent to cause an explosion. Arrests: Expert David Anderson QC, pictured, has said that police are acting earlier to 'clear the decks' of potential terrorists before London 2012 . He is alleged to have told someone that he had a bomb in his car and was preparing to drive to the Olympics in London and set it off. Police were alerted when the witness managed to make a 999 call on his mobile phone. Aktar is further charged with racially aggravated threatening behaviour towards a police sergeant. At a court hearing earlier this week Aktar was remanded in custody. Aktar is one of 14 suspected terrorists arrested last week. Detectives have been granted more time to question a 22-year-old woman over another suspected terror plot in the UK. Five men arrested last week in connection with the same plot, including British Muslim convert Richard Dart, can also be held until tomorrow after Westminster magistrates granted a series of warrants of further detention, police said. A seventh person held in the raids, a 30-year-old woman, was released without charge on Saturday. Dart, 29, who changed his name to Salahuddin al-Britani after converting, was one of the six people arrested over the suspected terror plot last Thursday. He is believed to have been one of three people detained in Ealing, west London, and was arrested in the street. He appeared in a BBC Three documentary, My Brother The Islamist, made by his stepbrother Robb Leech last year, which described how Dart, originally from Weymouth, Dorset, had been converted by controversial cleric Anjem Choudary. In the documentary he spoke of his support for jihad and sharia law. The others detained in Ealing were a 21-year-old man and a 30-year-old woman held at separate home addresses. The woman has since been released without charge. Three men living just over a mile from the Olympic site in Stratford, east London, were also arrested. The men, aged 18, 24 and 26, who are believed to be members of the same Bangladeshi family, were detained in a raid on their home. The six, who include a former police community support officer, remain in custody at a south-east London police station on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism. The alleged plan involved Islamist extremists with potential targets in the UK, but was not linked to the Olympics, it is understood. The threat to the UK from international terrorism is currently rated substantial - the third highest of five levels. Three men have appeared in court in connection with terrorism charges. Anzal Hussain, 24, Mohammed Saud and Zohaib Ahmed, both 22, appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court charged under Section 5(1) of the Terrorism Act 2006. They are jointly accused of preparing an act or acts of terrorism between May 1 and July 4 this year. The three men, all from Birmingham, face an allegation that they took part in activities including the manufacture of an improvised explosive device, the acquisition of firearms and other weapons, and the purchase of motor vehicles connected with the charges. The charges follow a series of arrests made last week by the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit, assisted by the North East Counter Terrorism Unit. Three other terror suspects appeared at the same court on charged with similar offences after shotguns, a nail bomb, machetes and a note addressed to a right-wing group were found in a car stopped by police on the M1. Jewel Uddin, 26, Omar Mohammed Khan, 27, and Mohammed Hasseen, 23, were arrested after a routine stop of a Renault Laguna by police near Sheffield on Saturday June 30. It was alleged that a cache of weapons was found in that vehicle along with a note addressed to the English Defence League, which was planning a rally in South Yorkshire that day. The court heard today Hussain, Saud and Ahmed, who were arrested on July 4, were allegedly travelling in a gold Rover which was in a convoy with the Laguna. The three men spoke briefly in court to confirm their personal details. No applications for bail were made and Deputy Chief Magistrate Daphne Wickham remanded them in custody to appear at the Old Bailey on July 31.

"Alexander Sotkin may have thought he was harmlessly posting selfies to his friends back home, but last night the 24-year-old Russian soldier was at the centre of international intrigue. For the photographs he has posted on the web appear to offer evidence that Vladimir Putin’s forces have been operating inside Ukraine. Geotagging – the process of adding a location to a photograph taken by a mobile phone camera – creates a trail that leads Sotkin, a sergeant in the signals corps, from a military base in southern Russia across the troublesome border to villages inside rebel-held parts of Ukraine. Scroll down for video . Alexander Sotkin, who says on social media he is a communications expert, has been posting selfies online . This picture was uploaded by Sotkin on July 3, which appears to show him inside an armoured personnel carrier . The revelation led to acute . embarrassment for Moscow last night as it continued to face . international condemnation following the still unexplained shooting down . on July 17 of the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 that killed all 298 . people on board. The geotag . trail starts on June 23, with Sotkin pulling a face and raising two . fingers while still on home soil, as Russia began building up its . forces. One week later, he . appeared from his Instagram postings to be at Krasna Talychka, a village . in eastern Ukraine controlled by pro-Russian separatists. On . July 5, Sotkin was seen rubbing his eye in a selfie on Instagram that . came with a caption saying  ‘time to sleep’. The geotag – which is made . by satellite based on a global positioning system – suggested the young . Russian had moved  to the Ukrainian village of Krasnyi Derkul. The photo map, from Sotkin's Instagram account, which appears to show two pictures, which were uploaded in Ukraine . According to the Sotkin's Instagram photo map, this picture was posted inside the Ukrainian border . The village, where this picture appears to have been uploaded is in rebel-held territory in the east of Ukraine . On . July 21 Sotkin, whose signals skills may have made him useful in . training rebels, is seen tucking into a melon, apparently back in . Russia. Five days ago, on . July 27, Sotkin posted another photo and wrote: ‘Sitting around, working . on a buk, listening to music, basically a good sunday.’ Western . governments believe that a Russian-made Buk weapons system was supplied . to rebel forces and that it mistakenly targeted the passenger plane . while intending to shoot down a Ukrainian military aircraft. Another explanation may be that he used the word ‘buk’ as shorthand to mean a notebook computer. In this post, Sotkin says he is 'sitting around, working on a buk, listening to music. He signs off saying 'basically a good Sunday' The 24-year-old who claims to be a Russian soldier describes himself as a communications specialist on social media . International experts finally reached the MH17 crash site yesterday – as up to 80 bodies still lay uncollected. After the Ukrainian army and pro-Russian rebels agreed to stop fighting for a ‘day of quiet’, a small team of Dutch and Australian specialists carried out a ‘reconnaissance’. ‘They can start searching as soon as possible during a later visit,’ said a Dutch spokesman. Australian foreign minister Julie Bishop said: ‘It’s heartbreaking. We have the experts ready to work and we can’t get to the site.’ There . is no evidence that Sotkin – usually seen in armoured personnel . carriers – is trained in Buk missiles nor that he had any role in . downing MH17. Why Sotkin posted pictures on the web may be due to the boredom he had complained about in another post. ‘I . still don’t understand what we’re doing here, so we’re continuing to go . slightly crazy, listen to Swedish House Mafia and wait for new news . from Ukraine!’ Even though a . geotag is normally a clear indication of a person’s whereabouts, some . experts were advising an element of caution last night. Sometimes a mobile phone cannot link to the GPS and instead uses roaming to identify the location. It . is possible that Sotkin could have been in Russia but his phone, . failing to link to the GPS, at that moment had roamed on to a Ukrainian . network based across the border. It could also be that the data from the satellite became corrupted and wrongly identified the location. Initially there was some speculation that the pictures might even be Ukrainian propaganda. Earlier . this week, a senior communist in Moscow, Vadim Soloviyov, called for a . crackdown on soldiers using social media sites, even though servicemen . are already banned from using mobiles while serving in Russian army . units. The location of Sotkin was not known last night. There was no official confirmation or denial that he is a soldier.","Alexander Sotkin, a Russian soldier, has been posting selfies on social media .

Amind thousands of fans and a B-25 bomber flying overhead, the remaining four members opened a bottle of cognac they had been saving at the National Museum of the U.S. Airforce near Dayton, Ohio, as celebration for the 70-year anniversary of their mission. The liquor was made in 1896, the year Lt. Col. Jimmy Doolittle was born.

Acting Air Force Secretary Eric Fanning . said America was at a low point, after the attack and other Axis . successes, before 'these men who showed the nation that we were nowhere . near defeat'. Only four of the men are still alive and sadly today's commemoration was referred to as the last. Museum officials estimated some 5,000 people turned out for Veterans Day weekend events honoring the 1942 mission credited with rallying American morale and throwing the Japanese off balance. Fanning noted that all volunteered for a mission with high risks throughout, from the launch of B-25 bombers from a carrier at sea, the attack on Tokyo, and lack of fuel to reach safe bases.

The Raiders said, at the time, they didn't realize their mission would be considered an important event in turning the war's tide. It inflicted little major damage physically, but changed Japanese strategy while firing up Americans. 'It was what you do ... over time, we've been told what effect our raid had on the war and the morale of the people,' Lt. Col. Edward Saylor, 93, said in an interview. The Brusset, Mont. native, who now lives in Puyallup, Wash., said he was one of the lucky ones. 'There were a whole bunch of guys in World War II; a lot of people didn't come back,' he said. Staff Sgt. David Thatcher, 92, of Missoula, Mont., said during the war, the raid seemed like 'one of many bombing missions'. The most harrowing part for him was the crash-landing of his plane, depicted in the movie Thirty Seconds over Tokyo. Three crew members died as Raiders bailed out or crash-landed their planes in China, but most were helped to safety by Chinese villagers and soldiers. Three of the four surviving Raiders were greeted by flag-waving well-wishers ranging from small children to fellow war veterans.

"The ABC is set to face annual budget cuts of about $50 million, which  means the national broadcaster will potentially lose some 500 jobs before Christmas.

Mr Turnbull confirmed the ABC's annual funding would be cut by five percent during an appearance on Q&A on Monday night. Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull is expected to announce within the next week cuts between $200 million and $300 million to both the ABC and SBS . The federal government announced a $9 million to the ABC in its May budget. Mr Turnbull declined to put a dollar figure on the controversial cuts to the national broadcaster, but said they were 'relatively modest'. 'It's about five per cent of the ABC ... it will average over five years about five per cent off the top,' he said on the ABC's Q&A program on Monday. 'We're spending more than we are receiving... so we've got to raise some more money and we've got to spend less. 'There is no reason for the ABC and SBS to be exempt from that.' Mr Turnbull confirmed the annual funding would be cut by five percent during an appearance on ABC program Q&A on Monday night . The ABC and SBS both declined to comment on the budget cuts and opted to wait for an official government announcement. Mr Turnbull said he would have a lot more to say about the issue later this week, but denied the government was breaking an election promise and maintained savings could be found from administration cuts rather than cuts to programming. 'I have gone to considerable pains to ensure that the ABC is well able to deliver these savings without cutting into the resources available to programming, through cutting back office costs, administrative,' he said. 'Anyone here who has been in business ... that could not manage to find five per cent out of efficiencies is not even trying.' Mr Turnbull said he would have a lot more to say about the issue later this week, but denied the government was breaking an election promise . ABC's Media Watch broke the news on Monday night with sources telling the program cuts would see Friday's state-based 7.30 editions axed, Lateline trimmed back, TV production in SA cut, $6 million will be sliced off ABC radio and bureaus in Tokyo, Bangkok, New Delhi and New Zealand scaled back.

"Men who drink lots of tea are far more likely to develop prostate cancer, researchers have warned. They found that those who drank seven or more cups a day had a 50 per cent higher risk of contracting the disease than men who had three or fewer. The warning comes after scientists at the University of Glasgow tracked the health of more than 6,000 men for four decades. Results: A study of 6,000 men spanning four decades concluded that those . who drank seven cups of tea a day had a 50 per cent higher risk of . contracting prostate cancer . Their findings run counter to previous research, which had suggested that tea-drinking lowers the risk of cancer, as well as heart disease, diabetes and Parkinson’s disease. The study, led by Dr Kashif Shafique, began in 1970. Participants aged between 21 and 75 were asked to complete a questionnaire about their usual consumption of tea, coffee and alcohol as well as their smoking habits and general health, and had to attend a screening examination. Just under a quarter of the 6,016 men were heavy tea drinkers, consuming seven or more cups a day. Of these, 6.4 per cent developed prostate cancer over the next  37 years. Researchers found that the subjects who drank the most tea were often teetotal and led healthy lifestyles. As a result, they may have been at a . lower risk of death from ‘competing causes’, effectively giving them . more time to develop prostate cancer, the journal Nutrition and Cancer . reports. Dr Shafique . said: ‘Most previous research has shown either no relationship with . prostate cancer for black tea, or some preventive effect of green tea. 'We . don’t know whether tea itself is a risk factor or if tea-drinkers are . generally healthier and live to an older age, when prostate cancer is . more common anyway.' New advice: The findings run counter to previous research, which had . suggested that tea-drinking lowers the risk of cancer, as well as heart . disease, diabetes and Parkinson's disease . He added that those drinking the most tea were less likely to be overweight or drink alcohol, and more likely to have healthy cholesterol levels. ‘However, we did adjust for these differences in our analysis and still found that men who drank the most tea were at greater risk of prostate cancer,’ he said. Dr Shafique did stress, however, that his team was ‘unaware of any constituent of black tea that may be responsible for carcinogenic activity in prostate cells’. Previous research has found health benefits from flavonoids – antioxidant compounds in tea that are thought to control inflammation, reduce excess blood clotting and limit narrowing of the arteries. Of seven previous studies on black tea and prostate cancer, four found a potentially protective effect while the remainder found no effect either way. Dr Kate Holmes, head of research at The Prostate Cancer Charity, said: ‘Whilst it does appear that those who drank seven or more cups of tea each day had an increased risk of developing prostate cancer, this did not take into consideration family history or any other dietary elements other than tea, coffee and alcohol intake. ‘It is therefore unclear as to whether there were other factors in play which may have had a greater impact on risk.’ Almost 80 per cent of Britons drink tea, consuming an estimated 165million cups each day. The British tea industry is thought to be worth more than £700million a year. Popular: Almost 80 per cent of Britons drink tea, consuming an estimated 165million cups each day. The British tea industry is thought to be worth more than £700million a year . Dr Carrie Ruxton of the Tea Advisory Panel, an educational body funded by the industry, said just 92 men in the Glasgow study drank more than seven cups a day and went on to develop prostate cancer. She added: ‘We’re lacking the complete picture because we don’t know what other dietary factors were involved. Other research suggests tea has a protective or neutral effect on prostate cancer, and the authors acknowledge there is no known ingredient in tea that is cancer-causing. ‘Tea-drinking may be a marker for some sort of behaviour that can raise the risk of prostate cancer, but the study does not show it is a cause.’ Prostate cancer strikes 40,000 British men each year, causing more than 10,000 deaths.","Researchers tracked 6,000 men over 37 years .

"Doug Fraser said a Hillsborough inquest should be . held early so a family didn't go to the pub . A solicitor who represented the families of Hillsborough victims after the disaster told the coroner he thought his clients just 'wanted their 15 minutes of fame'. Doug Fraser, who was on the Hillsborough Steering Committee, following the FA Cup semi-final where 96 fans died, argued for one inquest to be held at 9am to prevent the family of one victim from being able to 'go to the pub first', it has emerged. The victims' families have now called for the lawyer  to resign after the offensive comments came to light following further study of the newly published Independent Panel report. The report also showed that Mr Fraser suggested the cut-off point for evidence should 'probably' be nine minutes earlier than the 3.15pm time eventually imposed by coroner Dr Stefan Popper. Several families wanted this cut-off point pushed back to allow for a thorough investigation. Documents reveal Mr Fraser, who is now Liverpool’s deputy coroner, told South Yorkshire Police and the coroner some families were 'hotheads'. The panel was critical of Mr Fraser, saying his behaviour suggested 'a surprisingly critical, if not contemptuous, view of some of the bereaved families whose interests he represented'. The comments were made in February 1990 when Mr Fraser met with . the coroner, South Yorkshire Police and the force’s lawyer Peter Metcalf to decide on the format of inquests. A . note disclosed to the panel of the meeting records Mr Fraser saying: . 'There will be some families who want their, someone said, their 15 . minutes of fame. 'I suppose . to some extent they are going to have to be given that opportunity . aren’t they? I think the vast majority will go through very smoothly but . I think that there will be one or two who are going [sic] problems. 'There . will be one or two hotheads who will look for the ulterior motive . behind this. The vast majority will accept it in the spirit in which . it’s done. The press will do the same.' Later . in the conversation Mr Fraser and the coroner discussed start times for . inquests and he suggested one family should have an early start in the . morning at 9am. The minutes quote him saying: 'There is one family who . would swell the coffers of the local hostelry before they arrived.' Today Trevor Hicks, president of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, who lost his daughters Vicki, 15, and Sarah, 19, at the tragedy said Mr Fraser should resign. He said: 'This is a form of betrayal, I am staggered. 'He should consider his position. Any credibility he might have had has gone out of the window. 'I thought I was beyond shock after last week but I am so disappointed with him.' He said Mr Fraser was another name to add to the list of people who had let down the families of the 96. Hillsborough victims' families have called for lawyer Doug Fraser to resign after offensive comments came to light following more indepth study of the newly published Independent Panel report . Sheila Coleman, of Hillsborough Justice Campaign, added: 'I was not impressed with his conduct at the inquests, I felt he was clearly out of his depth.' Mr Fraser represented the families while working for Runcorn-based Silverman Livermore solicitors which he joined in 1982. He remains a senior lawyer at the firm. He became involved after Mr Hicks approached his then boss Sir Harry Livermore, who was involved in the legal cases after the Heysel disaster. Sir Harry died and Mr Fraser took over the case. His profile on Silverman Livermore’s website boasts of his role in 'protecting the interests of those who had been bereaved or injured' at the Hillsborough disaster in 1989. In mid-September Dr Popper wrote to the Hillsborough Steering Committee to request details of witnesses the families wanted calling at the resumed inquests. Ten days later Dr Popper recorded a conversation with Mr Fraser in which the families’ reactions to the interim inquest were discussed. Trevor Hicks, president of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, who lost his daughters Vicki, 15, and Sarah, 19, described Mr Fraser's comments as a form of betrayal . The note of the meeting states Mr Fraser considered 'it [mini-inquest stage] went very well', finishing 'within a few minutes of the scheduled time over a two-and-a-half week period'. He stated that a 'few' families, however, 'had expected more and they were not entirely happy with the way that he had asked any questions... but he confirmed that the vast majority of families were very satisfied with the way the inquests had been done'. This was clearly not the view of the Hillsborough Family Support Group. The documents include minutes of a meeting between HFSG and Sir David Napley, who had represented other families at another inquest on October 2, 1990. At the meeting it was stated that the mini-inquests had been limited to 'who', 'when' and 'where' and 'nothing more apart from the alcohol levels was raised'. HFSG representatives said Dr Popper had been 'quite clearly aggressive' towards families despite their 'polite' requests for information on the organisation of the inquests. The HFSG expressed concern about the power of the coroner, the lack of information received by families , that 'fundamental issues appertaining to this disaster' would remain unresolved and about their lawyers’ strength of commitment. According to Dr Popper’s notes on October 12 Mr Fraser informed him that, in fact, several families had 'some small queries on the individual inquests and [asked] was I proposing to deal with these and if so when'. Dr Popper asked Mr Fraser if families’ queries from the mini-inquests were substantial. Mr Fraser 'said he didn’t think so... as far as he could recollect they were relatively minor matters'. In the same telephone conversation Mr Fraser suggested a 3.06pm cut-off for evidence. Mr Fraser told the coroner ahead of the inquests that 'There will be one or two hotheads who will look for the ulterior motive behind this' Dr Popper states in his note: 'I explained to him that I was not intending to go over all the ground of the rescue. 'Mr Frazer [sic] agreed with this. He said he thought in his view probably six minutes past three was the cut-off point. 'I said I felt that it might be a few minutes beyond that but that was basically what I had in mind.' Dr Popper recorded having told Mr Fraser: 'I said that I thought that when we got down to it he would be quite satisfied indeed. 'I had the feeling that we might be doing a more thorough job than he was expecting.' Soon after, Dr Popper announced he was imposing the 3.15pm cut-off point. A number of families then wrote to the Hillsborough Steering Committee requesting the interim inquests be re-opened and the 3.15pm cut-off point be pushed back. Mr Fraser, who is now the Deputy Coroner for Liverpool, refused to comment.","Doug Fraser also told the coroner he thought some families were 'hotheads'

"Sugary foods and drinks should come with a smoking-style health warning, according to a leading Dutch health expert.

Writing on a public health website, he said that users should be made aware of the dangers. He wrote: ‘This may seem exaggerated and far-fetched, but sugar is the most dangerous drug of this time and is easy to obtain.’ He added: ‘Just as with smoking labels, soft drinks and sweet products should come with the warning that sugar is addictive and bad for the health.’ Mr Van der Velpen wrote that more and more people are becoming overweight and that this is increasing healthcare costs at a time when many governments are trying to save money. He added that obesity could be tackled by encouraging people to take more exercise, but that changing people’s diets would be more effective. He cites research which suggests that when people are eating fats and proteins they stop when they are full, but that when they are eating sugars they will keep eating until their stomachs hurt. Paul van der Velpen, head of Amsterdam's health service, said that sugar is 'the most dangerous drug of our time' and that it is the main cause of the obesity epidemic . He believes this is because sugar is addictive and is ‘as hard to give up as smoking’. As a result, he says sugar should be taxed in the same way alcohol and cigarettes are. He also suggests that the amount of sugar that can be added to processed food should be regulated.","Paul van der Velpen, head of Amsterdam's health service, says sugar is a drug and its use should be discouraged because it is addictive .

"Warning: Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood took aim at 'lazy' civil servants who survive year after year . Thousands of civil servants are ‘lazy’ and have been allowed to remain unchallenged in their jobs for years, Britain’s top mandarin admitted today. Sir Jeremy Heywood, the Cabinet Secretary, said the bottom 10 per cent of civil servants were below par and could be sacked unless they raise their game. It means that up to 40,000 of the 400,000 or so officials across central government could face being managed out as a result of their ‘performance problems’. The move comes as ministers approved a large increase in the number of politically appointed civil servants. The Coalition says the establishment of ‘extended ministerial offices’ – stuffed with officials personally appointed by Cabinet ministers – is necessary to ‘put a rocket’ under Whitehall. Senior Tory figures have accused mandarins of dragging their feet over implementing vital reforms and hope the expanded private offices, staffed by those loyal to ministers, will force top civil servants to raise their game. However, the reforms will lead to accusations that the Government wants to politicise the Civil Service and end its proud tradition of independence. The changes could also lead to a rise in the number of special advisers, who report directly to a minister and do not have to be politically independent. These so-called ‘spads’ could even lead the new offices as a minister’s ‘chief of staff’. However Sir Jeremy said the shake-up also needed to identify Whitehall's worst performers. He said: ‘There is a willingness to identify the top 25 per cent of people and give them proper rewards, but just as important – more important in some ways – the bottom 10 per cent, and give them an opportunity to improve themselves or, if not, move them out. ‘Nothing annoys good civil servants more than seeing lazy civil servants surviving year after year without anyone addressing that performance problem. ‘Addressing performance management is a huge way of motivating the rest.’ Improvements: Ministers hope that the reforms will force civil servants to up their game . When the Coalition came to office in 2010, the Conservative Party pledged to cut the number of special advisers. Since . then, however, David Cameron has become disillusioned with the pace of . reform, and he believes that permanent secretaries, the bureaucrats who . lead government departments, have too much power. Earlier . this year, Steve Hilton, Mr Cameron’s former director of strategy, . attacked ‘paper-shuffling mandarins’ who pushed through changes without . ministerial approval, often resulting in the Prime Minister learning . about Government decisions from the media. Former prime minister Tony Blair . later joined the attack, saying that the Civil Service was ‘hopelessly . bureaucratic’ and ‘not fit for purpose’. Reform plan: Francis Maude is behind the scheme to increase the number of politically appointed civil servants . The reforms follow the decision earlier this year by Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude to ask the Institute for Public Policy Research, a centre-Left think tank, to examine the workings of civil services in other English-speaking countries – including Australia, New Zealand and Canada – and find out if there were ways to improve the British system. The think-tank concluded that, in comparison to politicians in the other countries, British ministers were under-supported. Mr Maude will today announce that he has accepted the IPPR’s recommendations to allow ministers in charge of departments to set up the ‘extended ministerial offices’. These offices will comprise a mixture of civil servants and special advisers, all appointed directly by the minister, rather than by the permanent secretary in charge of the department. Some staff will be appointed from outside the Civil Service on short-term contracts to ensure that they do not kowtow to the permanent secretary. However, all staff will have to abide by the Civil Service code. Guy Lodge, associate director of the IPPR, said: ‘In comparative terms, UK ministers have relatively little direct support to draw on to enable them to do their jobs effectively. Strengthening ministerial offices will make Whitehall more responsive and more effective.’","Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood takes aim at coasting staff .

"Britain's biggest power station is suing the Government for losing a lucrative contract after a Mail on Sunday investigation revealed that it burns wood from precious US forests as a ‘green’ alternative to coal. Drax is committed to switching from coal to ‘biomass’, or wood pellets. In December, Energy and Climate Change Secretary Ed Davey promised the North Yorkshire plant two lucrative ‘contracts for difference’ – which would see it earn £105 for every megawatt hour it generates, rather than the normal price of £50. Britain's biggest CO2 polluter: Drax is suing the Government for losing a lucrative contract after a Mail on Sunday investigation revealed that it burns wood from precious US forests as a ¿green¿ alternative to coal . The extra money would come from subsidies funded by consumers’ household bills. But this paper revealed that much of its biomass is shipped in from historic wetland hardwood forests – 3,000 miles away in North Carolina. Environmentalists say this is destroying endangered species’ habitats, and increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Ministers have now withdrawn their promise to guarantee profits for the part of the plant using biomass. This wiped £400million off the company’s share price and prompted the firm to start legal action. A spokesman for Mr Davey said: ‘Drax was informed that this project no longer qualifies for the award of contract.’","Drax in North Yorkshire has committed to switching from coal to biomass .

"Doing overtime increases the risk of heart  disease by up to 80 per cent, a major study has claimed. Researchers say long working hours could be condemning thousands of employees to heart attacks and strokes. The warning follows analysis of 12 studies dating back as far as 1958, involving a total of 22,000 people from around the world. Time for a holiday: Research shows that employees who frequently put in overtime significantly increase their risk of heart attacks and strokes . The analysis, by scientists at the . Finnish Institute of Occupational Health, found that those whose working . days that were longer than the traditional eight hours had a 40 to 80 . per cent greater chance of heart disease. The size of the increase varied depending on how each study was carried out. The effects were more pronounced when . participants were asked how long they worked for – but when researchers . closely monitored working hours, the increased risk of heart disease was . closer to 40 per cent. Lead researcher Dr Marianna Virtanen . said the effects could be due to 'prolonged exposure to stress'. Other . triggers could be poor eating habits and lack of exercise due to . restricted leisure time. In 2009, the same team discovered . that long working hours increased the risk of dementia later in life. The effect was similar in magnitude to that of smoking. Calm down: Prolonged exposure to psychological stress, which can occur at work, may be one reason for the link between longer hours and heart disease . Middle-aged workers putting in 55 . hours or more a week had poorer brain function than those clocking up no . more than 40 hours, with lower scores on tests to measure intelligence, . short-term memory and word recall. Britons work some of the longest hours . in Europe, with full-time employees averaging 42.7 a week. Those in . Germany typically work for 42, while Danes do 39.1. It estimated that more than five million people a year in Britain work unpaid extra hours to hang on to their jobs. But the long-term toll on workers’ health could be devastating, the new research suggests. In a report on the findings Dr Virtanen said: ‘There are several potential mechanisms that may underlie the association between long working hours and heart disease. In addition to prolonged exposure to psychological stress she said other triggers could be raised levels of the stress hormone cortisol, poor eating habits and lack of physical activity due to restricted leisure time.","Researchers found spending too long in the workplace resulted in up to 80% greater chance of heart disease .

"The pontiff's life is in danger because his desire to sweep away corruptionis making organised criminal groups 'nervous', it has been said . The Mafia are considering a lethal strike on Pope Francis, a senior prosecutor in Italy's crime-torn deep South has warned. The pontiff's life is in danger because his desire to sweep away corruption in 'a total clean-up' is making organised criminal groups 'nervous', the deputy chief prosecutor of Reggio Calabria, Nicola Gratteri, claimed. Since Francis took office in April, he has made it clear that he intends to rid the Holy See of its corrupt ways and clean up the notorious Vatican bank, long used by money launderers. He immediately dispatched the . chairman of the IOR bank Gotti Tedeschi and subsequently forced his own . number two Cardinal Bertone, who had been accused of corruption, into . retirement. In one of his first sermons as Pope he took aim at the mafia calling on them to repent for 'exploiting and enslaving people'. And earlier this week in his most . impassioned sermon to date, the pontiff said that officials who took . bribes should be 'tied to a rock and thrown in the sea'. Dr Gratteri said the members of the . Calabrian Ndrangheta mafia are concerned by Pope Francis's crusade . against corruption, 'wearing his iron crucifix, as he rails against . worldly goods and plans a total clean up'. He told the Italian newspaper Il Fatto Quotidiano: 'Those that are in the financial arms of the mafia are concerned by Pope Francis, yes. 'Those who until now have been feeding off the wealth and power that comes directly from the Church are agitated and nervous.' Pope Francis speaks to Archbishop Georg Ganswein as he arrives in St. Peter's Square . He added: 'Papa Bergoglio [sic] is dismantling the centres of economic power in the Vatican. If the bosses could take him down they would not hesitate.' The prosecutor admitted that the mafia would not necessarily be capable of such a strike, with the Vatican security services some of the best in the world. 'I do not know if organised criminal gangs are in a position to do something, but they are certainly considering it. It's a dangerous time for Pope Francis.' In recent years, the Ndrangheta, based in Calabria, the 'toe' of Italy, has become the largest, richest and most feared of the country's three main criminal organisations. Specialising in cocaine trafficking, the Ndrangheta controls some 80 percent of the market in Europe and has invested its profits in northern Italy, Germany and the US. They have forged links with terrorist organisations worldwide and the drug cartels of South America. Meanwhile, according to the 14th annual survey from the Global Language Monitor, a Texas-based company that tracks top talkers on the web, the Pope is now the most talked-about person on the planet. More people are chatting about the Pope online than Edward Snowden, Kate Middleton and Miley Cyrus. The organisation based its analysis on English-language blogs, social media and 275,000 electronic and online news media. Besides being the Internet's top name, the Pope's Twitter handle @Pontifex was the fourth most talked about word in 2013. The top three words were: '404' - the numeric code for a broken web-page; 'fail' and 'hashtag'.","Since Pope Francis took office in April he has made clear he intends to rid the Holy See of corruption .

"More than 500 million people use public transport in New South Wales each year so you'd expect being a train driver you'd be pretty busy getting everyone from A to B on time. But a report has shown that's not the case, finding that train drivers have a lot of down time waiting around, and not actually doing what they're employed for. It seems in NSW they continue to spend less than 30 per cent of their working time actually driving trains, sometimes waiting up to three hours for a train to arrive to begin their shifts. An Auditors General report found train drivers are spending less than 30 percent actually operating trains . Rail Tram and Bus Union NSW secretary, Alex Claassens says it's not the choice of drivers to operate at minimal times because they have to adhere to certain restrictions on operating hours . The Auditor General report says the benchmark compared poorly to the North American average of 55 per cent and European average of 50 per cent. Rail Tram and Bus Union NSW secretary, Alex Claassens says it's not the choice of drivers to operate at minimal times. 'The train driving times are due to the rules that drivers have to adhere to, set by the Office of the national safety regulator,' he said. 'All trains have the same rules and there are strict guidelines on the hours we are allow to drive.' Mr Claassens said train drivers who do the country runs work about a 10 hour shift whereas those who do the usual suburban or city runs will work about an eight or nine hour shift. 'The reality is train drivers don't decide what to do, the work is rostered for them and the rules have been the same for the last 20 years,' he said. 'We take 10 minutes to check paperwork, then there's a schedule to give the train a service, time to prepare the train and make it safe and fit for passengers.' Rail Tram and Bus Union NSW secretary, Alex Claassens says we shouldn't compare our system with American systems because they are completely different . The Auditor Generals report also found six out of 16 suburban and intercity lines did not achieve the target in the last financial year . 'Some companies use other people to do that work but not in NSW. He says in varying hours of driving time you have to take into account the location, admitting that in country locations, the frequency of trains is less so drivers are waiting around more. Mr Claassens has also criticised the government for introducing a computer system to schedule drivers which he believes is nowhere near as efficient as when staff used to do it. 'Over the years we've challenged it, it's not efficient,' he said. 'We also shouldn't compare to American systems because they don't have a system like ours.' The report also found Sydney trains overall exceeded their on time running target, however six out of 16 suburban and intercity lines did not achieve the target in the last financial year. And a very frustrating result that it has been 11 years since the regional passenger TrainLink service, the former CountryLink, achieved it's on time running target of 78 per cent. 'On-time running results should be published for outer metropolitan bus regions,' said the Auditor-General. Buses too weren't exempt, with five of the 14 metropolitan bus regions were below the target, although good news for ferry users with the services continuing to achieve the highest on time running performance. The report also found complaints coming from Sydney train and NSW Trains commuters didn't go unnoticed, recording more than a 30 per cent increase in their first year of operation, mainly due to new timetables introduced . Rail Tram and Bus Union NSW secretary, Alex Claassens says a number of the complaints are due to staff not being able to help commuters with their Opal cards, questions, topping up or selling them to customers . Complaints coming from Sydney train and NSW Trains commuters didn't go unnoticed, recording more than a 30 per cent increase in their first year of operation, mainly due to new timetables introduced. Mr Claassens said the rise is complaints is probably due to rail staff not being able to help commuters with questions about their Opal cards. 'The government made a decision for us not to have anything to do with the Opal card, so staff can't help, we're the only system in the world where you can't help top up tickets and sell the,' he said. 'It's all about customer service and that's not customer service.' In light of this the new Opal card has been a hit used for 27,635,000 rail journeys, 1,161,000 bus journeys and 895,000 ferry journeys in the last financial year. A great plus for commuters, the system providing 5.1 million free journeys. Annual leave also seems to be a problem for the states transport agencies with over 3,000 employees accruing more than 35 days of annual leave at June 30 this year. 'All transport agencies should do more to reduce excessive annual leave balances,' he said. The report did show that more people are starting to use public transport for their everyday commute with the total passenger journeys increasing from 547 million to 560 million in 2013-2014, a 2.4 percent jump.","Auditor Generals report shows train drivers spent less than 30% of their shift operating trains .

An aircraft flies over Kobane, as seen from near the Mursitpinar crossing on the Turkish-Syrian border . 'Technical issues' concerning their transit through Turkey still had to be resolved, Rudaw said without elaborating. The Kurdish People's Defense Unit (YPG), said that fighting with Isis in Kobane began on Saturday and continued till midnight. It said it had killed 24 Isis fighters over the weekend, seized weapons and ammunition, and destroyed several vehicles. It added: 'Four of our comrades were martyred in action.'

Isis militants stand just before explosion from an air strike on Tilsehir hill near the Turkish border on October 23 . Kurdish forces, backed by US-led air strikes, have been holding out for weeks against an IS offensive around Kobane, which has become a high-profile symbol of efforts to stop the jihadist advance. The US military said in its latest update that American warplanes carried out five air strikes near Kobane on Saturday and Sunday, destroying seven IS vehicles and an IS-held building. Ground fighting for Kobane has killed more than 800 people since the IS offensive began on September 16, with the jihadists losing 481 fighters and the Kurds 313, said the Britain-based Observatory, which relies on a network of sources inside Syria for its information. Syrian Kurdish refugee Mohammad Hassan, 84 years old, from Kobane cries, backdropped by his home town, on a hilltop on the outskirts of Suruc, Turkey . Among the dead are 21 civilians, but the figures exclude IS losses to US-led air strikes, which the Pentagon has said run to 'several hundred'. The jihadist assault prompted nearly all of the enclave's population to flee, with some 200,000 refugees streaming over the border into neighbouring Turkey. Last week, under heavy US pressure, Turkey unexpectedly announced it would allow the peshmerga fighters to cross its territory to join the fight for Kobane. The main Syrian Kurdish fighting force in the town has close links with the outlawed rebel Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has fought a three-decade insurgency in southeastern Turkey and Ankara had previously resisted calls to allow in reinforcements. Meanwhile, rebel fighters with the Islamic Front have been gearing up to battle troops in Aleppo loyal to President Bashar Assad. The war has killed more than 190,000 people, according to the UN.

"Scotland's food supply should be laced with vitamin D in a bid to cut the high rate of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the sun-deprived region, experts have said. Scotland has some of the highest MS levels in the world and many experts believe vitamin D deficiency is a contributing factor. Vitamin D deficiency is caused by a lack of sunlight and for half of the year no one living in Scotland gets enough UBV rays from the the sun on their skin to make adequate levels of the vitamin D, it has been reported. Ray of light? Medical experts believe fortifying Scotland's food supply could tackle high MS levels in the absence of regular sunshine . Gloomy outlook: Scotland has some of the highest MS levels in the world and many experts believe vitamin D deficiency is a contributing factor . In addition, many do not eat enough of . the foods that contain it, such as oily fish, which has led to . international health experts calling for the food supply in the Scotland . to be fortified with the vitamin. Oxford academic Professor George Ebers says the evidence of the link between MS and vitamin D deficiency is so strong it warrants fortifying food with it, the Guardian reported. Professor Ebers, from the Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, and his team this month published their findings of a genetic link between MS and an uncommon inability for the body to produce vitamin D. He told The Guardian: 'Now . the question is, can we finally persuade the public health authorities . that they should supplement the population?' There have long been theories that high numbers of people with MS live in areas deprived of sunshine - while low levels of those in countries with year-round sunshine. Sir Harry Burns: Scotland's chief medical officer said 'broader scientific consensus' was needed . However, the authors of this new report claim it offers strong scientific evidence. About 10,000 people in Scotland have MS. Scotland's chief medical officer said this sort of change would only be considered after 'broader scientific consensus'. Sir Harry Burns told The Guardian: . 'It is important to remember that dietary supplements can have harmful . as well as positive consequences and recommendations need to be made on . the basis of evidential benefit in well conducted randomised studies in . large populations. 'Mass medication of the Scottish . population without such evidence would be considered irresponsible by . the public health community.' The MS Society in Scotland is championing a campaign launched by a 13-year-old boy whose mother had the disease diagnosed. Shine on Scotland is teenager Ryan McLaughlin's response to vitamin D deficiency. His mother, Kirsten McLaughlin, is very ill in hospital with MS. The campaign has seen Ryan meet with Government officials to appeal for vitamin D-fortified food. The youngsters father, Alan, revealed that the campaign had persuaded Kellogg's to add the vitamin to cereals.","Residents do not get enough UBV rays from the sun on the skin .

"An experimental drug has been found to lift depression in just over an hour in people who haven't responded to other treatments. The findings open up the prospect of developing a new fast-working type of anti-depressant. In a new study, a third of participants . responded to the treatment within one hour and 20 minutes, seeing at . least a 50 per cent reduction in their symptoms compared to a 15 per . cent reduction in those who took a placebo. Living in a fog: Sufferers of depression report feeling emotionally numb . This was significant as these patients had failed to improve in seven past antidepressant trials. However, while their were minimal . side-effects the dramatic improvements were short-lived with patients . finding relief for an average of just half an hour. The current range of treatments work through the brain's serotonin system, building up levels of this 'happy' hormone over a period of weeks. This can cause great distress to severely depressed patients as many are at high risk of suicide. However, the latest drug called AZD6765, acts by preventing the binding of a brain chemical called glutamate to nerve cells. It acts in a similar way to the Class C drug ketamine, but without the serious side-effects such as hallucinations. Drug pioneer: Dr Carlos Zarate, who has also studied anti-depressive effects of ketamine . Scientists at the National Institutes of . Health, who conducted the study, said this could be because the new . drug doesn't block glutamate binding as completely as ketamine. In the trial half of the 22 patients received the drug through an IV drip, while the other half took a placebo. All of them completed a survey assessing their depressive state immediately after taking the drug and a few days after treatment. The two groups then switched the agent they took and went through the same assessment. The patients reported only minor side . effects, such as dizziness and nausea, when taking AZD6765, which were not significantly . different from those experienced with the placebo. Research leader Dr Carlos Zarate, said: 'Our findings serve as a proof of concept . that we can tap into an important component of the glutamate pathway to . develop a new generation of safe, rapid-acting practical treatments for . depression.' The team reported their results online in the journal Biological Psychiatry. They now want to do further trials, testing whether repeated infusions a . few times per week or higher doses might produce longer-lasting . results.","Drug worked within an hour and 20 minutes - current anti-depressants take weeks to have an impact .

"A schoolgirl has been found dead amid claims from her friends that she was being bullied. Ashdon Muirhead, 14, was found  at her home in Thornton Heath, south London on Saturday after posting 'Imma miss you all' on Facebook. Friends have since taken to the social network to claim Ashdon was bullied before her sudden death. Darling Bless said: 'This is too sad, people need to think before they talk. You don't have to bully some physically but mentally and emotionally. Rip Ashdon.' Mackayla Mcleod added: 'Ashdon can't believe your gone when I heard the news couldn't stop crying such a beautiful girl taken from us at such a young age but your in a better place now the people who done this to you the blood is on their hands.' Ashdon Muirhead was found dead at the weekend and her friends have since claimed she was bullied . Another friend, Don Smith, commented on the post: 'Those bullies should burn in hell..' Police say they are not treating the death of the Norbury Manor Business and Enterprise College pupil as suspicious. They were called to Ashdon's mother's home at around 2pm on Saturday, two hours after the schoolgirl made her final post on Facebook. According to one neighbour, Ashdon lived with her mother Patricia Muirhead at the property. One local said: 'I looked out of the window and could see a woman screaming and crying, then very soon afterwards an ambulance came and the police. The whole road was blocked off, they were here all afternoon.' Ashdon's headteacher, Amanda Compton, did not comment on the bullying allegation, but said: 'The whole college are deeply saddened and shocked by the tragic news about Ashdon and we would like to extend our heartfelt condolences to her family at this incredibly difficult time.' Friends have placed flowers at the scene of Ashdon Muirhead's death after police were called on Saturday . Ms Compton added: 'She was a lively and intelligent student and both staff and students are struggling to come to terms with her loss.' The college says it has a support plan in place and will be running special assemblies as well as offering specialist counselling support to students, staff and pupils. Friends and well-wishers left flowers to the tragic 14-year-old outside her home today. One bunch with a note signed 'Jade' left by the front door read: 'Ashdon will forever and always remain a place in my mind and heart.' A Scotland Yard spokesman confirmed officers and paramedics attended the scene on Saturday. He said: 'The deceased is a 14-year-old girl. Inquiries into the circumstances continue.

"By the time most people get to the end of the John Lewis Christmas ad about the little boy and Monty, his lovelorn penguin, they are wiping the tears from their eyes or launching into a ‘Bah, humbug!’ tirade about the commercialisation of Christmas. But not me. As the heart-tugging music swelled and Monty got a girlfriend, there was only one thought going through my head: I cannot believe how lifelike they made this penguin. No doubt many of you thought the same, but I was prepared to be a harsh critic. For not only am I an experienced producer of wildlife documentaries, but it was my company that made last year’s BBC1 documentary series, Penguins: Spy In The Huddle. Scroll down for video . Adorable: Sam (Rhys Edwards) feeds Monty in John Lewis advert, where the penguin is unbelievably realistic . Adelie penguins in the wild - the males aren't as romantic as they have been portrayed in the advert and typically will have a different mate every year . After a year of filming, 1,000 hours of footage and months of editing, I know Adelie penguins better than most and Monty, an Adelie created by computerised special effects, is astonishingly true to life. The creative team have clearly done their research, impressively capturing the character and behavioural patterns that make the Adelie — with that white circle around those mournful eyes — one of the most lovable species of penguin. But though Adelies may be adorable, they are hardly the romantic gentlemen that John Lewis would have us believe. In fact, they are incorrigible philanderers. But more of that later. I first came across them when we were filming Emperor penguins for Spy In The Huddle, a series that made extensive use of hidden and, we like to think, cunningly camouflaged cameras. We had them hidden in fake penguins, fake chicks, fake lumps of ice, even fake eggs. Today, I’m delighted to say our minimally invasive approach is being used by zoologists working in Antarctica. But it also produced, for us, some extraordinary footage of what life for penguins is really like in the harsh polar environment — particularly when Emperor penguins come into contact with their much smaller cousins, the Adelies. The two species are the only ones to nest solely on the Antarctic continent, the Emperors toughing it out on nests through the winter while the Adelies (a French colleague of British adventurer Captain Scott named them after his wife) nest during the summer. Monty the penguin stars alongside actor Rhys Edwards, who plays Sam, in the heart warming advert . After looking for love, Monty is given the best Christmas gift he could have hoped for when Sam brings him a female penguin . But they use the same breeding grounds, which can lead to clashes in spring when the Adelies arrive and discover the Emperors haven’t left yet. The sight of bossy Adelies energetically trying to shoo away Emperor chicks almost twice their size provided one of the unexpected comic highlights of the series. At the risk of anthropomorphising, it’s almost as if they are natural performers. That’s why I have a film crew in Antarctica — in a region that really is called Adelieland — filming Adelie penguins for a BBC1 Christmas special. That’s Christmas 2015, I hasten to add. The Adelie — which, while declining in numbers, is one of the least endangered penguin species — seems to encapsulate what we love about penguins. They come ready-dressed in their comedy dinner suits, that ungainly waddle on land raises a smile and they have the cutest, fluffiest chicks — three reasons why they have emerged as the stars of popular Hollywood films such as Happy Feet, Mr Popper’s Penguins and the Madagascar cartoon franchise — the latest spin-off of which, Penguins Of Madagascar, is released next month. But we also admire how they battle against one of the harshest environments on Earth, surviving not just the extraordinary cold, but an array of predators such as the leopard seal and killer whale. And no penguin species is braver than the Adelie. Another of my favourite pieces of footage from Spy In The Huddle involves a huge seabird, a giant petrel, mounting an attack on a group of Emperor penguin chicks, only to be seen off by a small but feisty Adelie. He’s not even protecting his own species, for goodness’ sake, but the brave Adelie stands up for them as if they were his own. Or, indeed, her own; you have to get very close to an Adelie to determine its sex. At the end of the two minute commercial it's revealed that Sam had been playing with a cuddly toy and not, as portrayed, a live penguin . The detail in the John Lewis ad is so impressive. Playing football like Monty might be a bit of stretch, but Adelie penguins are accomplished walkers, often having to cover distances of up to 30 miles between their nesting grounds and the open sea where they go to feed. And, as the ad correctly shows, Adelies discovered long ago that if you come across an ice-covered downward slope then it’s far more efficient — and looks a lot more fun — to slide down it on your conveniently prominent belly. There are two more sequences in the ad I particularly like. One is when Monty pops vertically out of a park lake to land on the path next to his young owner. In the wild, Adelies have to reach underwater speeds of up to 30 miles an hour to achieve the vertical lift that sees them leaping straight out of the freezing sea and onto the ice. Normally they get the speed and angles just right, which, together with super-grippy feet, makes for an impressive, gravity-defying exit. But when they get it wrong, as they do occasionally, the result is comedy somersaults, back flips and their fellow penguins being knocked over like skittles. My favourite moment in the ad, however, comes when Monty takes a toy brick from the playbox and passes it in his beak to the boy. In an environment as tough as the Antarctic, where the chances of a fully grown bird surviving from one year to the next are slim, it makes little sense to mate for life . If Adelies are known for anything, it’s for building their nests out of pebbles, raising them above the ice so when the ice melts during the brief Antarctic summer, the eggs don’t become waterlogged. It’s that toy brick, rather than the soppy ending, that will draw a tear from anyone who knows their penguins. But while they have got most things right, the team behind the John Lewis ad made one mistake, or at least glossed over a distinctly unseasonal truth. As you listen to Tom Odell warbling his way through John Lennon’s Real Love and Monty stares balefully at one romantic couple after another, yearning for a girl of his own, you might imagine that Adelies were swan-like in their lifelong devotion to their mate. Far from it. They may be into sexual equality when it comes to dividing up domestic duties, sharing the feeding, nest-sitting and chick-raising between male and female, but they are surprisingly pragmatic when it comes to love, or rather, sex. In an environment as tough as the Antarctic, where the chances of a fully grown bird surviving from one year to the next are slim, it makes little sense to mate for life. Adelies are known for building their nests out of pebbles, raising them above the ice so when the ice melts during the brief Antarctic summer, the eggs don’t become waterlogged . If no willing female is to be found, frustrated male Adelie penguins will resort to chasing vigorously after other males and even, I’m afraid to say, attempting to mate with dead penguins . Some penguins, such as Rockhoppers, practise monogamy, but for Adelies it’s a different mate every year. Each spring the male Adelie builds his pebbly nest — often stealing from his neighbour for raw materials — in the hope of attracting a female. But if he doesn’t, the mating instinct can prove overwhelming, a fact that led one of the first scientific papers on the species to be withheld from publication in the prudish early years of the last century. For if no willing female is to be found, frustrated male Adelie penguins will resort to chasing vigorously after other males and even, I’m afraid to say, attempting to mate with dead penguins. In these more enlightened times, not many would bat an eye over gay penguins. But necrophiliac penguins? Sorry, Monty, that’s not real love, but it is real penguin life. Just don’t tell John Lewis.","John Downer spent a year filming BBC1's Penguins: Spy In The Huddle .

"A 34-year-old Washington woman who sadistically and systematically tortured her 13-year-old brother-in-law by beating him with a baseball bat, slicing his skin with a heated knife and forcing him to remain tied naked to a dog house without food and water has been sentenced to 31-years in jail. Silverdale mother Viviana Gunn was sentenced on Monday after she pleaded guilty in August to hanging 13-year-old Jordan Gunn from the rafters of her house for gruesome hours long 'sessions' of abuse according to court proceedings. Torturing the teen over the course of last year, Gunn once clamped the boys hand in a bench vise, tightened the jaws and drove a nail through his hand with a hammer. The teen told the shocked court that he could see the nail coming out the other side of his hand. Sickening: Viviana Gunn, 34, was sentenced today to more than 31 years in prison after pleading guilty to torturing a 13-year-old boy last year with a variety of tools and methods . Gunn’s husband and the teen's brother, Brandon P. Gunn, 27, is also scheduled to be sentenced on January 17 for the same crime. Brave escape: Jordan Gunn - was 13-years-old when he escaped sister-in-law Viviana Gunn and his own 27-year-old brother Brandon in August last year . 'I specifically remember Judge Laurie saying what Viviana and Brandon had done was evil and she was happy to get Viviana out of our county,' said Deputy Prosecutor Cami Lewis to reporters after the verdict was announced. Gunn made no statement to the court prior to sentencing - but she had written a letter to Judge Laurie on December 20 asking to withdraw her guilty plea. In the letter, said she 'was made' to sign the plea agreement with no explanation. 'I want to fight for my freedom,' she wrote. 'To be pushed to take a plea and admit guilt to an act I am not guilty of is not justice.' The horrific abuse dished out by Gunn and her husband unfolded to police when they found Jordan passed out on a bus bench after he had fled his house of horrors and been living on the streets for two weeks. Vicious: Brandon Gunn, 27, has also been found guilty of beating and torturing his younger brother and will receive 30-years . Noticing the gaping and infected wounds on his arms and feet, the boy told stunned police that his older brother and his sister-in-law dished out the 'sessions' of torture when he failed to do chores or 'for any other reason they chose.' Immediately launching an investigation and arresting Gunn and her husband, police interviewed Jordan to discover the terrible nightmare he had been living through. He told police that he had gone to live with his brother and his wife in Silverdale, Washington last year after leaving his mom in Atlanta, Georgia. The couple became the child's legal guardians. The torture sessions began when he was accused of theft at home and then became frequent over the course of the year - usually taking place in the cellar or his bedroom. Horrific: A picture of the 13-year-old reveals the deep wounds criss-crossed on his arms where he was cut, stapled and beaten . Torture: The child was reportedly kept locked up in a dog cage for days and only escaped by chewing through restraints . Neighbors reported hearing crying coming from the home but believed the sobs to belong to a younger child. His sister-in-law and her husband would duct tape the boy's arms and legs to a chair and then cover his eyes and mouth to prevent him from screaming. They would then beat his head and body with a baseball bat until he lost consciousness. Viviana and Brandon Gunn would duct tape Jordan's hands over his head to a vertical bar and then hang him from a wooden rafter where he was beaten with a metal bar and where the evil couple would then heat a knife with a lighter and cut him. The couple would then get further kicks from their cowardly attacks on the boy by spraying alcohol onto his wounds. Sometimes, the teen's 27-year-old brother would produce a staple gun and ram staples into his right hand - after which he would strike his teenage brother's feet with a hammer. House of horror: Neighbors reported hearing cries come from the home in Silverdale, Washington . Often Jordan was stripped naked and kept in a dog house for two or three days with no food or water or thrown into the cellar with his hands, legs, eyes and mouth duct taped for days. His penis was beaten with a baseball bat and he was given only water and a pill which caused him to fall unconscious. It was during the last session that his sister-in-law and brother left the house to get food while he was hanging from the rafters in the cellar. He managed to removed the duct tape from his mouth and chew away the tape that bound his hands together. He then rammed down the cellar door and fled onto the streets where he remained until he was found at the bus stop in Bremerton - in need of medical help. Kitsap County Sheriff's Office deputies took over the investigation after the numerous wounds on the boy's head, face, chest, abdomen, back, arms, legs, hands and feet were noticed. Charged: Brandon Gunn, 27, and his 34-year-old wife Viviana Gunn have been charged with assault for the alleged torture of his little brother . 'These injuries vary from fresh open wounds to wounds that are in the process of healing,' a police report states. 'The injuries appear to be caused by blunt objects, cords and other sharp objects.' Jordan told authorities that Vivian and Brandon Gunn had tortured him since the beginning of the school year when he moved from Georgia to Washington and sheriff's moved to arrest the couple at their apartment. Amazingly, the day after relatives reported Jordan as missing, sick Viviana Gunn began to post Facebook messages, claiming her young brother-in-law had a history of running away. 'Calling it a night, keeping the porch light on and prayers sent up,' she wrote on August 23. 'Just hope Jordan Gunn is safe, and his Mother received some forethought of peace and understanding. Up early to post flyers.' However, the very next day Jordan was found and sheriff's applied for a search warrant and arrested Viviana and Brandon Gunn on August 24. Jordan has now moved back to live with his mother in Atlanta.","Viviana Gunn, 34, has been given a sentence of more than 31-years for the systematic torture of her 13-year-old brother-in-law over the course of a year .

"The mother of slain U.S. ambassador to Libya, John Christopher Stevens, has spoken of her loss, saying her son’s death has left her with a ‘hole in her heart'. Mr Stevens, the first U.S. ambassador to be killed by terrorism in 33 years, was a career diplomat devoted to bringing democracy to the Middle East when he was killed in an attack on the US Consulate in Benghazi. Mary Commanday, a retired symphony cellist, said in an interview that although she feels animosity towards the attackers, her son would want his work to continue in Libya. Scroll down for video . Killed: The U.S. ambassador to Libya, John Christopher Stevens, who went simply by Chris Stevens, was killed in an attack on the US Consulate in Benghazi after a 20-year career in the foreign service . ‘He did love what he did, and did a very good job with it,’ she told the Daily News. ‘He could have done a lot of other things, but this was his passion. ‘I sure do feel animosity toward those . nuts who got in there and did this, (but) it had nothing to do with the . politics of Libya. They were not insurgents, they were Islamic . fanatics.’ Speaking of her feelings after she received the news she said: 'I have a hole in my heart.' In a heartbreaking twist, Mr Stevens was . struck down in a rocket attack on Tuesday by forces unleashed after . Muammar Gaddafi's power crumbled - an uprising the ambassador had . strongly supported. He was killed alongside three other . U.S. officials, including Foreign Service Information Management Officer . Sean Smith, a ten-year veteran of the State Department, a husband and a . father of two. Mr Stevens, who went by the first name . Chris, had only been appointed as Libyan ambassador by President Obama . in January. It came after an esteemed career within the United States . foreign service which spanned more than two decades. Making links: Mr Stevens said he was determined to bring democracy to the people of Libya . Loss: Hillary Clinton swore Mr Stevens in to his role earlier this year and called him 'eloquent and passionate' Speaking outside the White House on . Wednesday, President Obama hailed Mr Stevens and the three other U.S. officials who died in the attack as devoted to working for democracy. 'It's especially tragic that Chris Stevens died in Benghazi as it's a city that he helped to save,' Mr Obama said. With 'characteristic skill, courage . and resolve, he built partnerships with Libyans... and he worked . tirelessly to support this young democracy. 'He was a role model to those who worked with him and to the young diplomats who strive to follow in his footsteps.' John Christopher Stevens was killed . in the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi by protesters angry over . a film that ridiculed Islam's Prophet Muhammad. According to the State Department Office of the Historian, just five U.S. ambassadors have been killed by terrorists: . Two other U.S. ambassadors have died in plane crashes: . He added: 'These four Americans stood up for freedom and human dignity. We grieve with their families but let us carry on their memory... I have no doubt that their legacy will live on.' 'They exemplified America's . commitment to freedom, justice, and partnership with nations and people . around the globe, and stand in stark contrast to those who callously . took their lives,' he said. 'Chris . was a courageous and exemplary representative of the United States. Throughout the Libyan revolution, he selflessly served our country and . the Libyan people at our mission in Benghazi. 'His legacy will endure wherever . human beings reach for liberty and justice. I am profoundly grateful for . his service to my Administration, and deeply saddened by this loss.' Mr Stevens, . 52, was born in April 1960 and raised in California, where he stayed . for his undergraduate degree at the University of Berkeley, before he . graduated in 1982. In an introductory video for his role as . ambassador, Mr Stevens admitted he did not know much about the Middle East . until he travelled to Morocco in 1983. There, he worked as a Peace Corps Volunteer for two years, teaching English in the mountains - and 'quickly grew to love this part of the world'. When he returned to the United States, he graduated from the University of California's Hastings College of Law in 1989. After working in international trade law in Washington D.C. for two years, he joined the U.S. Foreign Service in 1991. Mr Stevens spoke French and Arabic, which led to a series of postings throughout the Middle East, including in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Syria and Israel. Younger years: Mr Stevens grew up in California and graduated from the UC Berkeley in 1982 . Calling: After graduating, he taught English in Morocco for two years and 'grew to love this part of the world' Service: Mr Stevens was posted throughout the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Syria and Israel . Devoted: Mr Stevens said he was looking forward to a stronger relationship between Libya and the U.S . In 1996, he was appointed staff . assistant in the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs at the State Department . in Washington and special assistant to the under secretary for political . affairs. By May 2007, he had also served as a staff adviser on Middle East affairs to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. His first posting to Libya came in June 2007 as a deputy chief of mission. Two years later, he became the chargé d'affaires at the embassy in Tripoli. His second tour in Libya came in . April 2011, when he served as special representative to the Libyan . Transitional National Council and was sent to rebel headquarters in . Benghazi, so he could better understand the different factions fighting . against Gaddafi. The journey meant Mr Stevens was the highest-ranking US representative to travel to Libya since the uprising began. In his introductory video, Mr Stevens . expressed his passion to help the people of Libya, saying he was looking . forward to a stronger relationship between the country and the U.S., as . it used to enjoy. Missed: Married father-of-two Sean Smith was also killed in the gunfire. The gaming community claimed Mr Smith was an avid member and posted this photo of him as they paid tribute to their friend . 'I had the honour to serve as the US . envoy to the Libyan opposition during the revolution, was thrilled to . watch the Libyan people demand their rights,' he said. 'Now I am excited to return to Libya to continue the great work we started.' He was appointed as ambassador in January and arrived in Tripoli in May 2012 to take up the role. 'Libyans are going through difficult times, . challenges,' he said in the video. 'I want peace in this part of the world.' His biography in the US Department . of State website reads: 'As the President’s representative, his job is . to develop a strong, mutually beneficial relationship between the United . States and Libya.' He leaves behind family in north California, CNN reported, adding that they were elderly. In a statement, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who swore Mr Stevens in for his post earlier this year, said: 'He spoke . eloquently about his passion for service, for diplomacy and for the . Libyan people. Welcoming: Mr Stevens is pictured with Arizona Senator John McCain, who visited Tripoli two months ago . Friends: Senator McCain posted this picture to Twitter in July, adding: 'Chris Stevens - one of America's finest diplomats also makes one of the best cappuccinos in Tripoli' Experience: Ambassador Stevens, who joined the foreign service in 1991, had been on two tours of Libya ahead of his role .

"Next time you are confronted with a complex problem, don’t worry - the answer could lie at the bottom of your garden. Leaving your laptop at home, switching off the smartphone and taking a walk in nature can help boost brain power by as much as 50 per cent, a study has revealed. Researchers found that adults performed much better in a creative test after spending four days in the great outdoors disconnected from modern technology. The great outdoors: Researchers found that adults performed much better in a creative test after spending four days in the great outdoors disconnected from modern technology . They say it is the first time that scientists have proven being in a park or woodland can improve your problem-solving skills. And it may also explain why a holiday helps recharge the batteries after busy periods of work. ‘The study shows that you need to leave the iPhones and other technology at home and give your brain a break,’ said co-author David Strayer, a professor of psychology at the University of Utah. ‘Too much of a good thing is not a good thing and so for creativity to flourish you need to disconnect from technology and reconnect with the natural world.’ Adults in Britain spend an average if three-and-a-half hours in front of the small screen each day - around 15 per cent of their life. The population’s increasingly sedentary lifestyle and vast use of tablet computers, televisions, smartphones, laptops and games consoles, has been linked to obesity problems and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and Type 2 diabetes. For the novel study, published in the journal PLOS ONE, 54 American adults with an average age of 28 participated in a four to six day hike. No electronic devices were allowed. Brain a break: Co-author David Strayer says that for creativity to flourish, one must disconnect from technology . Before the trip commenced, 24 individuals were tested and scored an average 4.14 in a 10-question creativity test. The remaining 32 were tested at the end of the walk and answered an average of 6.08 questions correctly - an improvement of 50 per cent. Researchers said the results indicate that time spent walking in parks and woodlands away from demanding technology helps individuals to restore brain power. They say a hike provides an easy way to lift your creative abilities after long periods in front of a computer or TV screen. ‘We show that four days of immersion in nature and the corresponding disconnection from multimedia and technology, increases performance on a creativity, problem-solving task by a full 50 per cent,’ said Prof Strayer. ‘We are not sure if it is the increased exposure to nature or the decrease in exposure to attention demanding technology that helps, but it’s probably a mixture of both. ‘In the real world, you are either in one or other state. When you head out into nature, you’re unlikely to be surrounded by gadgets, while if you’re at home or in the office the opposite is likely true.’ While earlier research has indicated nature has beneficial effects, ‘it’s equally plausible that it is not multitasking to wits’ end that is associated with the benefits,’ Prof Strayer said. He added: ‘This is a way of showing that interacting with nature has real, measurable benefits to creative problem-solving that really hadn’t been formally demonstrated before. ‘It provides a rationale for trying to understand what is a healthy way to interact in the world, and that burying yourself in front of a computer 24/7 may have costs that can be remediated by taking a hike in nature.’ Mix of both: Increased exposure to nature and disconnection from multimedia and technology improves problem-solving skills .","Researchers found that adults performed much better in a creative test after spending four days outdoors disconnected from modern technology .

"A paedophile teacher filmed himself . abusing girls  in the classroom after school bosses failed over 14 . years  to act on 30 warnings about his behaviour. Nigel Leat, 51, was described by a judge as a ‘paedophile of the most sickening order’ when he was jailed indefinitely last year for abusing five girls, some as young as six. Yesterday a damning report showed that the primary school where he worked had catastrophically failed to protect the children in his care. Scroll down for video . Paedophile: Nigel Leat, a married father-of-two, breaks down during questioning by police . Over 14 years, concerns had been raised repeatedly about Leat’s behaviour with pupils, but his conduct was never investigated. He had abused children in the school’s computer room, resource room, staff room and even during lessons with other pupils present. Leat also regularly filmed the pupils’ harrowing ordeals using a camera provided by the school,  storing hundreds of films on more than 20 memory sticks labelled with his victims’ names. Staff at Hillside First School in Worle, Somerset, first noticed Leat selecting girls who were ‘less academically able, emotionally needy or pretty’ as his ‘favourites’ a year after he started teaching there in 1996. Sentence: Leat was given an indefinite jail term for his actions . His inappropriate behaviour was so well known that staff tried to prevent children likely to become his ‘star pupils’ from being put into his Year Two and Year Three classes. In 2004, a mother claimed Leat had been taking pictures of her daughter with a mobile phone but he denied the accusation and no action was taken. Four years later, two children told staff that Leat, a married father of two, had been touching their legs and kissing one of them – causing her to be sick – and a teacher twice reported him to the head. Another member of staff saw Leat projecting an indecent image of an adult on to a wall during a lesson. Leat was also seen lifting up and groping young girls in the playground, tickling and cuddling pupils in class and sitting on cushions with a schoolgirl while visibly aroused. But those staff members who reported Leat’s behaviour were told they should not ‘insinuate things’ and were bullied into silence, a report said yesterday. It was later discovered that Leat would routinely hide a camera under his desk and then summon his victims, recording the subsequent horrifying images of the abuse. In many of the videos, which are up to ten minutes in length, other children can be seen or heard in the background. When police finally became involved, Leat first denied wrongdoing but later admitted 36 sexual offences including rape, assault and voyeurism. Yesterday a review by the North Somerset Safeguarding Children Board concluded that his appalling crimes could have been stopped much earlier if the school had not failed to act on the warnings. Instead, out of 30 disturbing incidents noted, only 11 were mentioned to the school’s headmaster, Chris Hood, and none was passed on to an agency outside the school. Abuse: Leat worked at Hillside First School, in Weston-Super-Mare, where staff complained but were ignored . Leat was only arrested in December 2010, when a schoolgirl told her mother he abused her ‘every day apart from when the teaching assistant was in the classroom’. Police who raided the home he shared with his wife, also a teacher, found more than 30,000 images, including 61 pictures and 21 movies at level five, the most serious level. At least 20 children were victims of Leat’s abuse or witnessed it at the school, which caters for 128 children aged between four and eight. Three Ofsted inspections undertaken during the time Leat was abusing his students graded it as ‘good’ and a report in 2009 noted: ‘Pupils feel exceptionally safe and secure because they know that staff have their well-being at heart.’ Tony Oliver, who chaired the  serious case review, said: ‘There was a failure at every level within the school. ‘There was a culture which just did not empower people to voice their concerns. It could be interpreted as a culture of bullying.’ He said the headmaster had  been sacked following a disciplinary process.","Nigel Leat was jailed indefinitely for abusing five girls - some as young as six .

"Barack Obama, David Cameron and Richard Branson are all ‘global warming Nazis’. This is according to scientist Roy Spencer, who is a professor at the University of Alabama at Huntsville and a vocal denier of man-made climate change. Dr Spencer believe that people who label those against human-induced global warming ‘climate deniers’ will ‘kill far more people than the Nazis ever did.’ The radical claim was made by climate scientist Roy Spencer, who is a professor at the University of Alabama at Huntsville and a vocal denier of man-made climate change . He argues, these same people should be appropriately labelled as ‘global warming Nazis.’ ‘When politicians and scientists started calling people like me “deniers”, they crossed the line. They are still doing it,’ he wrote in a blog post published yesterday. David Cameron is known to have used the term 'climate change denier' along with Barack Obama, Richard Branson, Nick Clegg and Ed Davey . Use of the term 'climate deniers' became controversial . after John Howard, former Australian Prime Minister, said that the . term was used with 'malice aforethought'. But In November, deputy prime minister Nick Clegg said he is entitled to call Tory climate sceptics 'deniers' despite a warning by the government's chief scientist that it is an abusive term. 'Surely I can agree with his scientific advice without agreeing with the choice of verbs, adjectives or nouns,' Clegg said. Sir Mark Walport told MPs last year that he was uncomfortable with the term. He said: 'As far as possible it is always best to avoid abuse. 'People do get heated and emotional about this. But we have to be clear that those who argue against the human contribution of climate change are wrong.' ‘They indirectly equate the sceptics' view that global warming is not necessarily all manmade nor a serious problem, with the denial that the Nazi's extermination of millions of Jews ever happened’ wrote Spencer on his blog. ‘Too many of us for too long have ignored the repulsive, extremist nature of the comparison,’ he continues. ‘It's time to push back.' His reasoning in using the word Nazis is because climate activists are, in his words, 'anti-capitalist fascists'. ‘[They are] willing to sacrifice millions of lives of poor people at the altar of radical environmentalism,’ he wrote. The words come from a prominent figure in debates surrounding climate change. Dr Spencer has been a called number of times by the Republican Party to give evidence to Congress. But the term ‘climate change denier’ isn’t hated by everyone. Dr Richard Lindzen, when asked which descriptive term he preferred, said: ‘I actually like “denier.” That's closer than ""sceptic""’. Steve Milloy, the operator of the climate change denial website JunkScience.com, told Popular Science, ‘Me, I just stick with ""denier"" ... I'm happy to be a denier.’ Dr Spencer has previously said: ‘I view my job a little like a legislator, supported by the taxpayer, to protect the interests of the taxpayer and to minimise the role of government.’ In the opening and closing of his blog, he writes: ‘Yeah, somebody pushed my button.' 'Deniers' are termed people that believe that global warming is either not occurring, or is not associated with the man-made rise in carbon dioxide. They have been heavily criticised for being pseudoscientific, despite an alleged overwhelming consensus on the reality of climate change. Journalists and policitican - including environmentalist George Monbiot - have described such scepticism as a form of denialism. Several commentators have also compared climate change denial with Holocaust denial, although others who believe in man-made climate change have condemned such comparisons as inappropriate and trivialising Holocaust denial. Monbiot wrote in his Guardian opinion column that he uses the term for those who attempt to undermine scientific opinion on climate change due to financial interests. Monbiot often refers to a 'denial industry', however other commentators have been described climate change 'deniers', including politicians and writers, who are not obviously linked to any industry group. In recent years the term has been associated with a series of views challenging the scientific consensus on issues including the health effects of smoking and the relationship between HIV and AIDS, along with climate change.","Claim was made by Roy Spencer, a professor at University of Alabama .

"Germany has guaranteed Britain will be protected from a more powerful eurozone as the two countries examine plans to kick out jobless migrants after three months. David Cameron yesterday signalled his support for the idea to send migrants home if they fail to find work. Now Berlin has offered a fresh boost to the Prime Minister’s plans to curb Brussels’ influence after Germany said the UK must not be put at a disadvantage by eurozone nations' moves to integrate more closely. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has offered David Cameron fresh support for his plans to reform the Europe Union . Mr Cameron has promised that if he is Prime Minister after the next election he will claw back powers from the European Union before holding an in-out referendum. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is a key ally in any attempt to reshape the EU, and Downing Street is delighted at the lengths she will go to to ensure Britain remains in the bloc of 28 countries. The Berlin Government released a report suggesting that new arrivals should be returned to their countries of origin within a few months. German politicians have suggested the limit should be set at 3 months - though the document does not specify an exact deadline. The UK has already restricted access to benefits for migrants until they have been in Britain for three months. Mr Cameron said he would work with Berlin on plans to deport jobless migrants who fail to find work . But the German plans would go further, giving member states the right to kick out those who are not working. Mr Cameron said the proposals are proof that key European Union leaders are coming round to his view that there should be greater restrictions on free movement around the EU. A major risk for Britain has been being squeezed out or over-ruled by countries which use the euro forming closer ties in an attempt to shore up the single currency. But in a joint article for the Financial Times, Chancellor George Osborne and his German counterpart Wolfgang Schauble said any changes to EU treaties must ‘guarantee fairness’ for member states outside the single currency bloc. The declaration meets one of Mr Cameron's key negotiating demands - that the rights of non-eurozone states must be protected - ahead of his planned 2017 referendum on Britain's membership of the EU. In their article, Mr Osborne and Mr Schauble said that both Britain and Germany accepted that the eurozone crisis meant that the members of the single currency needed to establish a common fiscal and economic policy. ‘The UK fully recognises the progress made so far in responding to the crisis, and it supports the case for further steps forward. 'But as the euro area continues to integrate, it is important that countries outside the euro area are not at a systematic disadvantage in the EU,’ they wrote. ‘So future EU reform and treaty change must include reform of the governance framework to put euro area integration on a sound legal basis, and guarantee fairness for those EU countries inside the single market but outside the single currency.’ The statement will be seen as evidence that Mr Cameron's assiduous efforts to court German chancellor Angela Merkel - including rolling out the red carpet for a high-profile visit to London - are bearing fruit. Tackling immigration is a major concern in both countries, with Germany's coalition government considering proposals to limit the time unemployed migrants from other EU member states can stay in the country looking for a job. British Chancellor George Osborne and his German counterpart Wolfgang Schauble hav written a joint article guaranteeing Britain will be protected from greater eurozone integration . Mr Cameron said that he would now seek to work with the Germans and other like minded allies to see if they could tighten EU rules further. Mr Cameron told BBC Radio Derby: ‘We are doing what the Germans are doing which is introduce new rules that you cannot immediately claim benefits if you come here and if you are a EU citizen and not looking for work and claiming benefits then you can be removed to your country of origin. ‘We’ll look very closely if the Germans want to take this further. I talked to Angela Merkel personally last week and we are going to work with her, with the Swedish prime minister, with the Dutch Prime Minister on how we can tighten up in this area because it is worthwhile work.’ George Osborne and Wolfgang Schauble . Mrs Merkel commissioned the report by a German government committee in January amid concern about the lifting of restrictions on Bulgarian and Romanian migrants. An interim version of the report published earlier this week also recommends that governments be allowed to prevent migrants expelled for committing fraud from returning to their countries - a restriction that currently does not exist. A spokesman for the German Embassy in London said: ‘The committee recommends the introduction of a time limitation on the right of residence for EU citizens seeking employment. EU citizens must provide evidence that their ongoing attempts to find a job have a prospect of success. ‘The right of EU citizens to reside in Germany can already be stopped in case of fraud and abuse of rights, such as forging documents or wilful misrepresentation. 'However, there is at present no way to prevent the immediate re-entry of EU citizens who abuse their right of freedom of movement. ‘Therefore, the committee proposes the introduction of temporary re-entry restrictions for cases of “abuse of rights” and “fraud”.’ The final report is due to be published in June. Downing Street sources said that they were also encouraged by suggestions from Germany that migrants should no longer be able to send child benefit to their children back home - a move that both Mr Cameron and Nick Clegg have also supported.","London and Berlin form strong alliance on the future of the Europe Union .

Ms Buchholtz, pictured here pregnant with Ava, was first diagnosed with breast cancer after the couple returned from a trip to Europe in October 2012 . The couple have terminated two pregnancies since they started trying for a family - once during her first fight with an aggressive stage four breast cancer in 2012. They stored Ms Buchholtz's eggs before she underwent chemotherapy and had a double mastectomy. Ms Buchholtz and Mr Ansalone decided to try again for baby Ava when Ms Buchholtz thought she was finally cancer free. But 17 weeks into the pregnancy, her cancer returned and doctors said it had spread to her spine. In just two months, 12 new tumours have grown and spread into her neck, back, pelvis, hip and thigh. 'We've been told her prognosis is not good and there's no cure,' Mr Ansalone told the newspaper. 'So having the baby has been the best thing at this stage. It has helped us push through.'

"BT Sport have announced that they will be showing Bradford's FA Cup quarter-final clash against Reading for free after the BBC snubbed the League One club for a second time. The last-eight tie will be played on Saturday March 7 and will be available for everyone to watch on btsport.com and on the Sky TV platform. The BBC again rejected the opportunity to show Bradford live on TV despite coming in for criticism after they did not air the Bantams giant killing over Premier League opposition Sunderland. Billy Clarke (centre) fires Bradford ahead against Sunderland as they set up FA Cup quarter-final . Jon Stead (right) seals the tie with a neat finish to complete the FA Cup fifth round giant killing . Bradford players celebrate as they beat Premier League side Sunderland 2-0 at Valley Parade .

Liverpool v Blackburn Rovers - March 8, 16.00 kick-off live on BT Sport 1 . Manchester United v Arsenal - March 9, 19.45 kick-off live on BBC1 . Simon Green, head of BT Sport, said: 'The excitement of the FA Cup continues on BT Sport and we have two fantastic quarter-finals on the channel. 'This will be the second time that BT Sport have shown Bradford City in this year's FA Cup and because Bradford City Football Club have been very passionate about the UK seeing their amazing club run, BT Sport have decided to make the game against Reading available to everyone to watch, online, via BT TV and Sky.' The BBC had first and third pick of the last-eight matches and understandably plumped for Manchester United's clash with Arsenal at Old Trafford as first choice. BT Sport, who are sharing FA Cup coverage with the BBC, opted to show Liverpool against Blackburn as their first pick, and the BBC have ignored Bradford's match in favour of the Midlands derby between Aston Villa and West Brom. Mark Chapman said that  the BBC had to choose the live games before Bradford's opponents were known . Stead joked during his post-match interview that the tie against Sunderland should have been shown on TV . Gary Lineker and Mark Chapman were subject to a cheeky tweet from Bradford  following their FA Cup win . The decision not to show Braford's fifth-round tie led to supporters chanting 'are you watching BBC?' and goalscorer Jon Stead even joked that the game 'should have been on TV' during his post-match interview, and the BBC risked further backlash by ignoring the club once more. Match of the Day Two presenter Mark Chapman on Sunday night moved to clarify why the BBC had not shown Bradford's win over Sunderland. 'I do have an answer on that subject,' the presenter said. 'And it comes from the BBC football management who say the following: ""They had to pick their live games before the replays were played in the fourth round and therefore couldn’t be sure who Bradford would be at home to. If they had been allowed to wait they would have chosen it"".' The BBC's football editor later released a statement explaining how selections for FA Cup matches are made. The TV match selections for the 5th round of the FA Cup caused a bit of a reaction yesterday, so I wanted to use this post to explain in a bit more detail how the selection process works. You still might not agree with our picks, particularly if you're from Bradford, but hopefully you'll see there's a bit of logic to what we try to do. As Gary Lineker mentioned yesterday, the hardest thing is that both the BBC and BT have to make our selections before the outcome of replays. That's the only reason why Phil Parkinson's side didn't get a live match this time round. We had to weigh up the options and given Sunderland's recent form, thought it was a realistic possibility of the match being League One against a Championship side. In this case it wouldn't have been much of a shock whatever the result and the winners would be guaranteed a live Quarter-Final, as Reading have done by progressing at Derby. If Bradford definitely had a home tie against Premier League opposition we certainly would have chosen to have the match live on BBC One. That has been a big part of our policy so far, showing AFC Wimbledon, Cambridge, Bristol City and tonight Preston, all looking to overcome opposition from the top flight. As the game unfolded yesterday at Valley Parade, we shared the frustration of fans and would have loved to have been broadcasting the match live. It's everything the FA Cup and our new comprehensive coverage is about. We are speaking to the FA about whether we can change this in the future, but understand it's tricky for them. Clubs understandably want to get plans for ticketing, policing and fans in place without waiting for 10 days for TV companies to confirm their selections. But we hope there's a middle ground where we can get a little more flexibility to ensure we have as much chance as possible of capturing cup classics like yesterday. Of course a lot of things are easy in hindsight. We have been really pleased with most of our picks so far and really fortunate to get some proper cup shocks. Warrington from the eighth tier overcoming Exeter City, Blyth Spartans winning in dramatic fashion at Hartlepool, AFC Wimbledon running Liverpool close and Cambridge holding Manchester United under the Abbey Stadium lights. It's also great to see the difference the TV money can make to these clubs, as well as placing them in the national spotlight with over 7 million viewers tuning in. Our audience research also suggests that fans want to enjoy a mix of these David vs. Goliath matches and games involving Premier League sides. For those who can't afford subscription to sports channels, it's been great to be able to see live international stars like Alexis Sanchez, Angel Di Maria, Steven Gerrard, Ron Vlaar and Alex Song, all as part of the licence fee. While the Aston Villa vs. Leicester game wasn't everyone's cup of tea, it was a hotly contested Midlands derby with both clubs picking full strength sides and produced a cracking second half watched by over 4 million. Of course, we would have loved to have been live at Chelsea in the 4th round and Bradford in the 5th, but the good news for fans is that even when a game isn't shown live there's always comprehensive Match of the Day highlights available. There's a lot more extra coverage devoted to the FA Cup on the BBC, with lots of additional content and different ways to enjoy it. After the 4th round, 26 million people had watched the coverage on the BBC, that's 8 million more than on terrestrial TV this time last season. It's not all about viewing figures and ratings, but it's pleasing to be able to bring coverage of the world's most loved cup competition to such a wide audience. Despite some of the criticism coming out of Bradford, a lot of thought goes into the matches we pick, and I hope the selections outlined above show we are particularly keen to showcase clubs outside the Premier League. I'm a Bristol Rovers fan myself so know all too well what the cup can mean to those outside the elite. When we sit down tomorrow morning to pick our two matches for the Quarter-Final we will take all I've discussed into consideration, but the good news is that all four matches will be live on TV. That means Bradford's incredible heroics over the last five rounds have guaranteed them a money-spinning Quarter-Final game and boy do Bantams fans deserve it!","Bradford City take on Reading in the last eight of the FA Cup on March 7 .

"A High Court judge has ordered two men to stay away from teenage girls in a landmark legal ruling to prevent sexual exploitation. It came after social services bosses in Birmingham became concerned about the welfare of a vulnerable 17-year-old girl who is in the care of the City Council who was seen with the men. Mr Justice Keehan granted long-term injunctions against the two men  - aged 27 and 31 - after social workers and police raised concerns that the girl was at risk of sexual exploitation. He barred the men from approaching the girl until she turned 18, and from approaching 'any female under 18', with whom they were not personally associated, following a public hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London. A High Court judge has ordered two men to stay away from teenage girls in a landmark legal ruling to prevent sexual exploitation . He is due to analyse evidence against several other men at a hearing in London on Wednesday. A lawyer representing Birmingham City Council told Mr Justice Keehan bosses had launched civil court proceedings against a number of men with the aim of protecting youngsters who may not understand what was happening to them. Lorna Meyer QC said West Midlands Police had supported the council's move. She said the council and police had identified a 'number of individuals' found to be 'inappropriately' in the company of the 17-year-old girl. Lawyers thought that there was not enough evidence to secure criminal convictions - on a beyond reasonable doubt basis - 'at the current time'. Mr Justice Keehan granted long-term injunctions against the two men - aged 27 and 31 . But they thought that there was enough evidence to obtain civil court injunctions - on a balance of probabilities basis. Miss Meyer said if long-term injunctions were made, and any of the men were found 'in the company of a vulnerable child' by West Midlands Police or Birmingham City Council, then lawyers would ask a judge to impose jail terms for contempt of court. 'Vulnerable children and in some case adult victims have often been groomed, persuaded or threatened,' Miss Meyer told the judge. 'It can be difficult to empower the victims to come forward and give evidence against the perpetrators of the exploitation. 'This case does not rely upon the victim to give evidence.' She added: 'Birmingham City Council have taken this innovative legal step with the support of West Midlands Police to help remedy that situation and to protect vulnerable persons where they are frightened or lack understanding of what is happening to them.' Miss Meyer referred to investigations in 'other localities'. And she said there had been concerns that the only way to disrupt such 'behaviour' was to place a child who was the focus of concern in secure local authority accommodation. But she said Birmingham City Council hoped that by seeking court orders against men, 'inappropriate behaviour' would be disrupted and victims would get the message that 'this is not down to you'. Children's charity the NSPCC backed the council's approach. Officials said social services bosses had taken a brave, if possibly controversial, step. 'We absolutely support this move as its ultimate aim is to protect young girls who are potential sexual abuse victims,' said Jon Brown, head of the NSPCC's programmes tackling sexual abuse. 'This is a serious child protection issue as several recent grooming cases have graphically shown and the authorities must use every weapon in their armoury to stamp it out. 'We know that many victims do not realise they have been groomed by calculating offenders who are simply targeting them for sex and sometimes to 'sell them on' to other abusers. Our work in this area shows it is a sickening and insidious crime which severely damages many young lives.' He added: 'This is a brave step that may prove to be controversial but any measured effort to stop the foul activities of those seeking to exploit vulnerable children is to be welcomed.' Mr Justice Keehan was told how police had seen the 17-year-old girl getting out of a Nissan Micra containing the two men - who were aged 27 and 31 - in the early hours of the morning in early October. Police said she had waved to the men and walked away. They said the car had then sped off and gone through a red light. Miss Meyer said police had stopped the car, arrested the men, found a half-empty vodka bottle on the back seat and a mobile phone which had been used to call the girl. Officers had spotted the girl walking in a street a short time later. She had smelled of alcohol and had asked: 'What are you doing to my boys?' The men said they had seen the girl walking in the street in the early hours, had been concerned for her safety and had offered her a lift. Mr Justice Keehan said he was satisfied that the men were 'seeking to sexually exploit' the teenager. A lawyer representing Birmingham City Council (pictured) told Mr Justice Keehan how bosses had launched civil court proceedings against a number of men with the aim of protecting youngsters who may not understand what was happening to them . 'The explanation that a 27-year-old man and a 31-year-old man pick up a 17-year-old girl in the early hours of the morning in some way to protect her is, I am quite satisfied, culpable nonsense,' said the judge. 'I am satisfied, so that I am sure, that the reason why they invited (the girl) into their car was for nefarious purposes.' He added: 'I am quite satisfied given the totality of the evidence that they were seeking to sexually exploit this young vulnerable woman.' Mr Justice Keehan has ruled that the 17-year-old girl cannot be identified. He has also ruled that the two men cannot be identified. The judge heard that police had concerns for the 'safety and well-being' of the men and their families. He was told that officers wanted to assess 'likely community reaction' if the men's identities were revealed in the media - and consider steps which may be required to protect them and their families. Mr Justice Keehan said his 'starting point' was that the media should not be prohibited from identifying the men. He said he would consider whether to allow their identities to be revealed on Wednesday, after police safety assessments had been made. Journalists at the hearing told Mr Justice Keehan that they were concerned about such a reporting restriction being imposed. The judge said there was a 'high degree' of public interest in the case - and he said he understood that concern. Miss Meyer told the judge that the council had run up more than £30,000 in legal bills. And she said officials wanted the men, one of whom was unemployed and one of whom worked at a newsagent's, to each contribute around £2,000 towards those costs. Lawyers for the men, one of whom was legally-aided, said neither could afford to pay.","Police raised concerns about the welfare of a vulnerable 17-year-old girl .

"Votubia (everolimus) could shrink brain tumours by up to 50 per cent in children with the rare disease tuberous sclerosis complex . A drug that can shrink brain tumours by up to 50 per cent in children with a rare disease has been launched in the UK. NHS doctors will be able to apply for funding from health trusts for Votubia (everolimus) for children with growing non-malignant brain tumours associated with a condition called tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). The once-a-day pill offers an alternative to surgery and could provide a lifeline for up to 1,600 youngsters in the UK with the tumours. The drug, which has been granted orphan drug status for rare diseases, has been shown to shrink subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) tumours associated with TSC. TSC is a genetic disorder which leads to non-malignant tumours forming in organs, most commonly the brain and kidneys. Brain tumours occur in up to 20 per cent of patients with TSC, causing physical and mental disability. Chris Kingswood, head of research at the Tuberous Sclerosis Association, said: 'For a long time there has been a desperate need for a useful alternative licensed treatment to invasive brain surgery. The Tuberous Sclerosis Association website . Chris Kingswood, who is head of research at the Tuberous Sclerosis Association . 'Everolimus is the first licensed product we can offer patients to attack the cause of their debilitating condition; it works by blocking a protein that acts as an important regulator of tumour cell growth. 'The way it works in the signalling pathway can be simply likened to blocking a receiver so it cannot process signals from the aerial on an analogue radio, so that the signals can no longer transmit to drive in this case tumour cell growth.' Dr Finbar O'Callaghan, consultant in paediatric neurology at the University of Bristol, said: 'SEGA is a serious complication in TSC, accounting for much of the increased mortality seen in this condition. 'Until now, brain surgery has been the only option for treatment and the availability of a pharmacological therapy is a major milestone and provides a treatment option in those cases where surgery is difficult or not possible.'","Drug provides a lifeline for up to 1,600 youngsters in the UK with the tumours ."
"A family visiting a drive-through safari park got a closer encounter than they bargained for when a camel poked its head in their car. Driver Ryan Duckworth while visiting a local safari park with his family when the hilarious wildlife encounter took place. Calling out 'It's humpday!' as he drives slowly past the camel, the serviceman is caught by surprise when the camel suddenly pokes its head in his car window, looking for food. YouTube user Ryan Duckworth lures the camel over to the vehicle with a tasty treat in his palm . The animal quickly pops its head into the open car window and reaches in even further to eat the snack . The clip was uploaded to YouTube by Ryan, a member of the U.S. Army who is based in Fort Hood, Texas. While it's unclear where the video was filmed, it could possibly be at the local Topsey Exotic Ranch - a drive-through safari park, quite nearby to Fort Hood, in Coryell County, Texas. In the hilarious video, the driver tosses a packet of snacks onto his front seat companion's lap - and the camel reaches his long neck into the vehicle even further to retrieve it. Meanwhile, the entire car screeches in surprise. The camel doesn't just stop with the crisps, however, he takes the entire paper bag out of the vehicle . Ryan and his family erupt into laughter as the animal chows down on everything in sight . Laughter erupts as the camel pulls the paper bag out of the car and devours it in just a couple of swallows. 'He just wrecked the whole thing!' the videographer chuckles as the camel chows down. The friendly camel hangs out around the car window while he finishes his snack and even allows the driver of the vehicle to give him a few pats. As he finishes his snack, the family thinks that the camel will head off.. but they couldn't be more wrong! The animal soon pops his head back in - this time, gnawing on the driver's arm - while the entire car screeches with laughter . And just when you think the camel is done visiting with the family, he pops his head back in once more - looking for any leftovers of the snack he just enjoyed. Instead, he manages to latch on to the driver's left arm, causing everyone in the car to laugh even harder. 'The camel wanted all the food,' Ryan wrote under the video on YouTube. 'My arm included!'","Ryan Duckworth uploaded this hilarious video while at a US safari park .

"This is the tiny cell where Oscar Wilde was jailed for two years after being found guilty of homosexuality, inspiring him to write his last published work The Ballad of Reading Gaol. In 1895, at the very height of his fame, the celebrated writer was sentenced to two years hard labour after a showcase trial which saw him charged with acts of of gross indecency. Following short stints in Pentonville and Wandsworth prisons he was moved to Reading Gaol, a sprawling prison built in 1844, then home to some of the country's most dangerous men. Grim: Cell 33, C Wing, Reading Prison, where the celebrated writer Oscar Wilde spent the majority of his two year sentence after being found guilty of gross indecency . For the sensitive, fun-loving Wilde, the prison experience was devastating and he left a broken man. Financially ruined and living in exile in exile in France, he penned his last published work The Ballad Of Reading Gaol. The prison closed as gaol in 1920 and was used as an internment site in both world wars, before being converted into a Borstal, a local prison and a Remand Centre and Young Offenders Institution. The Ministry of Justice has now closed its doors for ever, but this week a group of amateur photographers were allowed inside to . capture the empty cells before its final fate is decided on. The prison experience left Wilde a broken man. He went into exile in France where he wrote The Ballad of Reading Gaol. Pictured, right, is a lithograph of Reading Gaol, from around the time of its opening in 1844 . The 170 year old prison, in the centre of Reading, Berks, was closed last year. Its future has not yet been decided on . The photographs of the 170-year-old prison in the centre of Reading, Berks., give a small insight into what life behind bars was like for Wilde and other prisoners of his day. Warren Askew, a member of the Woodley Photographic Club, was a former prison officer at the jail and asked if he and his camera-loving friends could be allowed in. What they captured was a haunting snapshot of the empty cells, landings and common rooms. A look along one of the wings at Reading prison.

A picture, right, of the condemned man cell, later used as an office, with a sign above the door saying 'Place of no return' It also showed how barbed wire and bars are still methods used to stop prisoners escaping. 'So many people drive past every day and have no idea what it looks like on the inside,' said Mr Askew. It was quite eerie in there. 'Like every place people are needed to make it come alive and with nobody there it felt very strange.' Three of the four wings were used in the final days as a Young Offenders’ Institute with prisoners still occupying Oscar Wilde’s cell. He was incarcerated the top floor in wing C number 33 between 1895 and 1897. The club had to submit all the photographs taken by the 24 members before certifying the ones they were allowed to use for security reasons.

The future use of the prison building or whether it will be demolished has not yet been decided. HM Prison Reading was designed by George Gilbert Scott and was considered 'state of the art' when built in 1844. Public executions took place at the prison between 1845 and 1913, drawing crowds of up to 10,000 people.

Oscar Wilde, jailed for two years for gross indecency with another man. The charges came from his unsuccessful libel action against The Marquess of Queensberry whose son, Lord Alfred Douglas, was Wilde’s lover. The Ballad of Reading Gaol was his last work and published in 1898. Other famous inmates include Hollywood star Stacey Keach who spent six months in Reading prison after being found with cocaine when he arrived at Heathrow airport in 1984. A portrait of Oscar Wilde . Famous for his razor sharp wit, flamboyant dress sense and enormously succesful plays, Oscar Wilde was one of the Victorian era's best known characters. The son of two Anglo-Irish intellectuals, Wilde studied at Oxford before moving to London where he mixed with the capital's most fashionable circles and began a career as a writer. He is perhaps best known for his play The Importance of Being Ernest, which was still being staged in London's West End when he was arrested on charges of sodomy and gross indecency. He wrote only one novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray published in 1891. In prison, he wrote De Profundis, a long letter discussing his trial and subsequent jail sentence. When Wilde was released he had undergone a transformation, and was no longer the pleasure seeking socialite.  He went into exile in France and died destitute in Paris at the age of forty-six. Today he is fondly remembered for his razor sharp wit and brilliant quotes. On arrival in the USA he is once said to have breezed through customs announcing: 'I have nothing to declare but my genius'. Other memorable quotes include: 'There are only two tragedies in life: one is not getting what one wants, and 'We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars'. Even on his deathbed he was said to have quipped: 'Either those curtains go, or I do'","Historic prison in the centre of Reading is finally closing after 170 years .

"A mother-of-two has shed an impressive five stone after being too embarrassed to hit the beach in a bikini - despite living in sunny Cyprus. Sheryl Kearney, 23, from Cottesmore in Sussex, weighed 15st when she moved to the island and wore size 18 clothes. But after swapping an unhealthy diet of chips and sugary cereal for healthy salads, Mrs Kearney is now a slim size eight  and weighs just 8st 12lb. Scroll down for video . Sheryl has managed to drop from nearly 15st and a size 18 (left) to just 8st 12lb and a size 10 (right) Mrs Kearney, who married husband Sam, 28, in 2010 and now has two sons, Jack, three, and Isaac, one, says she has always struggled with her weight. But when the couple relocated to Cyprus, Mrs Kearney was left miserable and covered up her size 18 frame with leggings and dark clothes - despite the 30 degree heat. She even installed a temporary swimming pool in her back garden, even though the beach was just metres from her doorstep. 'I wanted to use the beach, but I was far too embarrassed to go there,;' explained Mrs Kearney. 'It's a shame I spent my first year living in Cyprus stuck inside. 'When I lost the weight, I loved finally getting to the beach in my bikini and feeling proud of my body.' Sheryl said she didn't have time for a wedding diet and was forced to walk down the aisle in a size 18 dress . Despite living just meters from the beach in Cyprus (left) Sheryl was too embarrassed to wear a bikini . After eating healthily through her pregnancy with son Jack, Sheryl decided it was time to make a change . Mrs Kearney was living on an unhealthy diet of what she describes as 'rubbish' throughout her teens, and continued to do so in the run up to her wedding. But shortly after the couple married, Corporal Kearney, of 2nd Battalion of the Royal Anglian Regiment, was posted to Cyprus for two years. 'There was barely time to plan the ceremony, let alone think about a wedding diet,' remembers a rueful Mrs Kearney. 'I crammed my bulky body into my corseted wedding dress and forced myself to think about married life in sunny Cyprus with my perfect man. 'I may not have had my dream wedding body, but I was tying the knot with my dream man and I told myself that was the most important thing.' Stationed in paradise, the pair had an apartment which overlooked the Mediterranean. But despite living a stone's throw from the beach, Mrs Kearney couldn't face squeezing into her bikini. Gone are the days when Sheryl covered up her size 18 frame with leggings and dark clothes despite the 30 degree celsius heat (left) and she is now confident in a tiny two-piece (right) 'I just couldn't face the thought of baring my folds of flab on the beach, among the bikini-clad holidaymakers,' she says. 'When Sam was on leave from work, he'd convince me to join him on a sunshine stroll along the promenade but being with him only made things worse. 'The chafing on my legs was so bad I had to stop and sit down every few yards. We installed a pop-up pool in the back garden so I could cool off in the heat, even though we lived right by the sea.' In August 2011, Mrs Kearney gave birth to her first son, Jack. After eating healthily throughout the pregnancy she knew it was time to change her diet and joined her local Slimming World group. Mrs Kearney used to eat two bowls of Coco Pops for breakfast, a baguette with chicken and butter for lunch and a burger with chips and onion rings for dinner. Throughout the day she would snack on biscuits and crisps. But with the help of diet experts, Mrs Kearney adopted a new eating regime, which now includes  fresh fruit and natural yoghurt for breakfast, a stir fry made with fresh vegetables and lean chicken for lunch and a homemade lasagne for dinner. Sheryl no longer feels self conscious next to husband Sam (pictured with her and son Jack before she lost weight, left) Since her life-changing weight loss Mrs Kearney has launched her own Slimming World group in Oakham . Throughout the day she snacks on fresh fruit and ham. 'I wanted to enjoy my last summer in Cyprus and I wanted to wear shorts rather than leggings,' adds Mrs Kearney. 'Finally, after a lot of hard work I felt confident enough to hit the beach in a bikini and for the first time I attracted glances from strangers for all the right reasons. 'My husband loves me no matter what I look like. But he loves how much more confident and happy I am now.' Mrs Kearney also started walking for more than an hour every day, which combined with her healthy new diet, resulted in a dramatic 5st 3lb weight loss. 'When we moved back to England I went shopping with my mum. It felt fantastic to be able to treat myself to size eight dresses,' she adds. ''I had never enjoyed shopping for clothes and trying things on before.'","Sheryl Kearney, 23, weighed 14st 7lb and was left embarrassed by her body .

"'Hate crime': Police are investigating 'abusive and threatening' emails sent to Archbishop of York Dr John Sentamu . The Archbishop of York has been sent several ‘abusive and threatening’ racist emails after speaking out against gay marriage. The malicious messages to Dr John Sentamu have prompted a police investigation, it was revealed yesterday. In an interview last month, the . senior Church of England cleric said that marriage must remain a union . between a man and a woman. He argued that the Prime Minister . would be acting like a ‘dictator’ if he allowed homosexuals to wed, . rather than just have civil partnerships as is the case at present. Yesterday a spokesman for . Ugandan-born Dr Sentamu said the Archbishop received a ‘large quantity’ of correspondence following the interview, adding: ‘Amongst many . positive emails that he has received, there have been a small number of . abusive and threatening emails of a racist nature which North Yorkshire . Police are investigating as hate crimes.’ In the interview Dr Sentamu said: . ‘Marriage is a relationship between a man and a woman. I don’t think it . is the role of the state to define what marriage is. It is set in . tradition and history and you can’t just [change it] overnight, no . matter how powerful you are. ‘We’ve seen dictators do it in . different contexts and I don’t want to redefine very clear social . structures that have been in existence for a long time and then . overnight the state believes it could go in a particular way.’ The Government will open a consultation on the issue of same-sex marriages next month. Dr Sentamu said bishops in the House . of Lords had not tried to stop civil partnership laws introduced by the . previous Labour government, but predicted widespread opposition to plans . to legalise gay marriage. ‘The rebellion is going to come not . only from the bishops,’ he said. ‘You’re going to get it from across the . benches and in the Commons. ‘If you genuinely would like the . registration of civil partnerships to happen in a more general way, most . people will say they can see the drift. But if you begin to call those . “marriage”, you’re trying to change the English language. ‘That does not mean you diminish, . condemn, criticise, patronise any same-sex relationships because that is . not what the debate is about.’ Clergymen have demanded that the Church's Parliament allows priests to hold same-sex ceremonies in churches . Last week, while Dr Sentamu was . abroad, about 70 protesters staged a demonstration outside York Minster, . the cathedral where he serves. They denounced Dr Sentamu’s comments and accused him of homophobia. The University of York’s Lesbian, Gay, . Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) group, which organised the . demonstration, said Dr Sentamu was opposing equality. A spokesman for North Yorkshire Police . said of the emails: ‘We can confirm that a complaint has been received . from the office of Archbishop John Sentamu, following the receipt of . emails containing racially offensive statements. ‘The emails are being investigated as a hate crime.’","Archbishop of York sent 'abusive and threatening' emails .

"'I couldn't breathe': Chris Richmond suffered burns and bruising on his . neck after hitting a leash stretched across his path by walkers . A motorcyclist feared he was going to die when two middle-aged walkers garrotted him with a dog lead by stretching it across his path as he rode a motorbike through a field. Chris Richmond said he was travelling at about 20mph when he rode into the leash, causing burns and bruising to his neck. Medics at hospital told him he could have been decapitated in the incident, which left him shocked and unable to breathe. The factory worker, of Newton Heath, Manchester, believes the man and woman holding the lead did so in revenge because he was riding the motorbike where he shouldn't have been. Police are treating the attack as grievous bodily harm. The incident happened after Mr Richmond, 23, and two friends approached some teenagers who were riding a green 125cc motorbike on grass in the Failsworth area of the city. He and his friends asked for a turn on the bike. He said: 'I remember the woman giving me a dirty look beforehand, as if to say, ""You shouldn’t be doing that"". 'Perhaps I shouldn’t have been but that was no way to react. You don’t expect that from middle-aged people. 'They could have called the police and they would have moved us on. 'I couldn’t breathe and thought I was going to die.' Mr Richmond, a father of one, had been out of work for two months but completed an eight-hour factory shift the day after the attack. Shocked: Medics told Mr Richmond he could have been decapitated by the lead . Grievous bodily harm: Greater Manchester Police are appealing for witnesses to the incident . He had just been taken on by a jobs agency and said he was desperate to get back to work to support his one-year-old daughter, Remme-Mae, and her mother, Jordane, 21. He had previously worked for insurance firm Direct Line for five years. Chris said: 'I was really looking forward to getting back to work. 'I’ve been down the agency to show them my injuries and they were very understanding. 'They were amazed when I told them I went to work on Sunday.' The woman dog walker was short, had blonde hair and was in her late thirties or early forties. The man was also in his late thirties or early forties, had dark hair and was about six feet tall. Greater Manchester Police was unable to comment on the case today. Scene: The field in Manchester where Mr Richmond was garrotted .

"After a summer witnessing crowds of screaming girls jostling to catch a glimpse of Olympic diver Tod Daley's toned torso, there can't have been many young men who didn't feel a twinge of jealousy. But now it seems there could be more to having the teenager's athletic physique than unfailing female attention - it could help you live longer too. A team of researchers from Sweden have found muscular boys will live longer than their weaker friends. A new study has claimed muscular teenage boys could live longer than their weaker school friends. Olympic diver Tom Daley, 18, has achieved his athletic physique through years of training . And even if they are overweight by the time they get to adulthood, those with stronger muscles tend to live longer. The team tracked more than one million Swedish . male adolescents, all conscripts to the army and aged 16 to 19, over a . period of 24 years. The teenagers were asked to grip and to do leg curls . and arm push ups  as a test of muscle strength. The scientists found those with low strength, weak legs and arms and with a limp grip, were more likely to die earlier. The report also suggests that physically weaker people might be more mentally vulnerable. But the study, published in the BMJ, stressed that it does not mean building muscle through excessive weight training would make you live longer. They have concluded that a basis of muscle strength instead reflects general fitness. Over the course of the study, 26,145 . of the men died. The Swedish researchers concluded that muscle strength reflects general fitness . The leading single cause of death was accidental . injury, followed by suicide, cancer, heart disease and stroke. A third of the deaths were due to other causes and the researchers grouped these together for their calculations. The teenagers who scored above average . on muscular strength at the start of the study had a 20 to 35 per cent lower risk . of early death from any cause and also from cardiovascular diseases. They also had a 20 to 30 per cent lower risk of . early death from suicide and were up to 65 per cent less likely to have any . psychiatric diagnosis, such as schizophrenia or depression. But the 16 to 19 year olds . with the lowest level of muscular strength had the highest risk of . dying before they reached their middle ages. While the effect of poor muscular fitness in those observed was similar to other risk factors for early death, such as obesity and high blood pressure, researchers still found the link between early death and muscle power remained after the other factors were taken into account. The study also found thin and fat men alike fared worse in terms of life expectancy if they had weaker than average muscles, while more muscular men had better survival odds even if they were overweight. But experts stress the findings do not mean muscle building through excessive weight training makes you live longer.","Researchers tracked more than one million Swedish .

"Fanatics from the Islamic State terror group have beheaded one of their own commanders after accusing him of being an MI6 agent, according to reports. Abu Ubaida Almaghribi, head of IS security in Aleppo, northern Syria, was once in charge of a prison where American journalist James Foley and other Western hostages were held. But he has now been executed after fellow extremists accused him of passing on information about IS activities to the UK. Scroll down for video . Abu Ubaida Almaghribi, head of IS security in Aleppo, northern Syria, has been executed after fellow extremists accused him of being an MI6 agent, according to reports. Above, this grainy image is thought to be Abu Ubaida . Abu Ubaida is believed to be a Dutch national of Moroccan descent, although his real identity is not known. IS claimed he was executed a day after video footage of Mr Foley’s beheading emerged on YouTube. A former IS prisoner last year told Belgian state prosecutors that Abu Ubaida was in charge of security when he and Mr Foley were held there last year. Last night the Foreign Office declined to comment on the claims, circulated by Moroccan and Jordanian news agencies. A security source said: ‘In the past, other extremist groups and states have made claims of spying as a justification for executing one of their own.’ He added that the IS message may have been passed on to the local media by a third party. Execution: Abu Ubaida was once in charge of a prison where American journalist James Foley and other Western hostages were held. Above, Mr Foley is pictured in a sickening video that captured his execution . A report by Moroccan news outlet Alyoum24 said: ‘Ubaida Almaghribi, who is originally from Morocco, and served as the head of intelligence services of the ISIS organisation in Aleppo, Syria, was beheaded after being accused of reporting information on the activities, movements, and plans of ISIS to the UK.’ Morocco World News stated: ‘ISIS militants reportedly beheaded a group of prominent leaders including Abu Ubaida Almaghribi, because of doubts regarding their allegiance and work for foreign entities.’ Mike Doran, a Middle East expert at the Washington-based Brookings Institution, said the alleged execution was a sign of ‘nervousness’ within IS’s higher ranks. Rebels: More than 500 British jihadis have joined the ranks of IS and other extremist groups in Syria and Iraq, but nearly half have returned home, offering opportunities to gain intelligence. Above, ISIS rebels in Syria . Belgian jihadi Jejoen Bontinck, from Antwerp, returned home last year and is understood to have given Western intelligence agencies, including MI6, vital information about the group that was holding Mr Foley and other prisoners in Aleppo. He said Abu Ubaida was a Dutch jihadi who was head of security at the prison. The 19-year-old said he and Mr Foley were held for at least three weeks by a group of Belgian jihadis called Shariah4Belgium, who accused him of being a traitor because he wanted to go home. But when the terror group pulled out of Aleppo last year, the prisoners were taken to the IS stronghold of Raqqa. It is thought that it was then that Bontinck either escaped or was freed. According to Bontinck, the so-called ‘Beatles’, who are allegedly responsible for Mr Foley’s murder, were not part of the group that held them in Aleppo. They were first identified after the transfer to Raqqa. Western security agencies, including MI6, have been working hard to get intelligence on IS but the speed of the group’s advance across Syria and Iraq has left them flat-footed. More than 500 British jihadis have joined the ranks of IS and other extremist groups in Syria and Iraq, but nearly half have returned home, offering valuable opportunities to gain intelligence. Philip Balboni, the chief executive of GlobalPost, the American news site for which Mr Foley worked, has confirmed Bontinck was held with the journalist. He told NBC News: ‘A young Belgian who had travelled to fight in Syria befriended Foley and, once that jihadist went back to Belgium, offered excellent information on roughly where Jim was held and by whom. It was the first time we knew that Jim was alive.’","Abu Ubaida Almaghribi was head of ISIS security in Aleppo, northern Syria .

"Former vice president Dick Cheney and his wife Lynne have said they are 'pained' over the public dispute between their two daughters over their differing views on gay marriage. On Sunday, Liz Cheney, who is currently running as a . Republican candidate for Senate in Wyoming, reaffirmed her disapproval . of gay marriage on Fox News Sunday despite having a legally-married lesbian . sister. ‘This is an issue we have dealt with . privately for many years, and we are pained to see it become public,’ Cheney and his wife said in a joint statement released on Monday. Daughter: Ms Cheney, the eldest daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, left, had begun telling associates of her decision over the weekend, CNN reported late Sunday . Mary Cheney and her . wife Heather Poe, who she married in 2012, both took to social media on Sunday night to blast Liz Cheney. ‘Liz - this isn't just an issue on which . we disagree - you're just wrong - and on the wrong side of history,’ Mary Cheney wrote. In a separate Facebook post, Heather Poe called her sister-in-law's comments ‘offensive.’ ‘Liz . has been a guest in our home, has spent time and shared holidays with . our children, and when Mary and I got married in 2012 - she didn't . hesitate to tell us how happy she was for us,’ Poe wrote on the social . media site. Sisters at war: The Wyoming candidate for senate Liz Cheney, left, announced her staunch opposition to gay marriage angering her gay married sister, Mary Cheney, right . ‘To have her now say she doesn't support our right to marry is offensive to say the least.’ Monday's statement from the former vice president and his wife also appeared to be an attempt to bolster Liz Cheney's run for the Wyoming Senate seat. ‘One thing should be clear. Liz has always believed in the traditional definition of marriage. She . has also always treated her sister and her sister's family with love and . respect, exactly as she should have done,’ said the couple. Liz Cheney was asked on Fox News Sunday if she was flip-flopping on her gay marriage stance. Host Chris Wallace pointed out that while she had opposed a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, she had also supporting the State Department's plan to offer benefits to same-sex employees and their partners. 'It's not, and I stand by both of those positions,' Cheney said. 'I don't believe we ought to discriminate against people because of their sexual orientation. Happier times: Vice President Dick Cheney smiles at daughter Elizabeth after taking the oath of office as daughter Mary, center and wife, Lynne, look on during the 2005 Inauguration Day ceremony . Not backing down: Liz Cheney reasserted her stance against gay marriage in November despite having a legally-married lesbian sister . 'If people are in a same-sex relationship and they want their partner to be able to have health benefits or be designated as a beneficiary in your life insurance, there's no reason we shouldn't do that. 'I also don't support amending the Constitution on this issue. I do believe it's an issue that's got to be left up to the states. I do believe in the traditional definition of marriage,' Cheney added. In September her sister Mary Cheney, who legally married her longtime partner Heather Poe in Washington last year and has two daughters, wrote on Facebook saying her sister's stance on gay marriage was 'dead wrong'. 'For the record, I love my sister, but she is dead wrong on the issue of marriage. Freedom means freedom for everyone. That means that all families - regardless of how they look or how they are made - all families are entitled to the same rights, privileges and protections as every other.' Liz Cheney responded to that message on Sunday, saying that she too loves her sister but this is an issue 'on which we disagree'. Cheney's strong-stance on the issue of gay marriage may have to do with her fight to win the senate race in ultra-conservative Wyoming. Partner: Mary Cheney wed her longtime partner Heather Poe, left, in 2012. They are pictured here at a memorial for victims of the 9/11 attacks . Push back? Liz Cheney claims her opponent Mike Enzi is conducting a push poll campaign that asks voters 'Are you aware that Liz Cheney supports abortion and aggressively promotes gay marriage?' ‘I am not pro-gay marriage,’ Cheney previously said in a statement released by her campaign. Cheney announced her run for senate against incumbent Republican Senator Mike Enzi last month. ‘I believe the issue of marriage must be decided by the states,’ the statement continued, ‘and by the people in the states, not by judges and not even by legislators, but by the people themselves.’ This stance is also a slight departure for the candidate in regards to her high profile father. Since as far back as 2004, Dick Cheney has maintained a pro-gay marriage stance. ‘Lynne . and I have a gay daughter, so it’s an issue our family is very familiar . with,’ Cheney told an audience that included his daughter while . stumping in Iowa in 2004. ‘With . the respect to the question of relationships, my general view is . freedom means freedom for everyone. People ought to be free to enter . into any kind of relationship they want to.’","Dick Cheney and his wife have spoken out about the public dispute between their daughters on the issue of gay marriage .

"Dramatic new research has claimed that the effects of global warming may be less that first predicted. Australian scientists have narrowed the predicted range of global warming through groundbreaking new research. However, the team behind it said the smaller rise could still have major effects - and warned we cannot wait for more exact figures before acting. The paper, published in Nature Climate Change today, found that exceeding 6 degrees warming was now unlikely while exceeding 2 degrees is very likely for business-as-usual emissions . The paper, published in Nature . Climate Change today, found that exceeding 6 degrees warming was now . unlikely while exceeding 2 degrees is very likely for business-as-usual . emissions. Dr Roger Bodman from Victoria University and Professors David Karoly and Peter Rayner from the University of Melbourne have generated what they say are more reliable projections of global warming estimates at 2100. This was achieved through a new method combining observations of carbon dioxide and global temperature variations with simple climate model simulations to project future global warming. Team leader Dr Bodman said while continuing to narrow the range even further was possible, significant uncertainty in warming predictions would always remain due to the complexity of climate change drivers. 'This study ultimately shows why waiting for certainty will fail as a strategy,' he said. A recent climate change protest in London: 'Our results reconfirm the need for urgent and substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions if the world is to avoid exceeding the global warming target of 2 degrees needed to minimise dangerous climate change,' the researchers said . 'Some uncertainty will always remain, meaning that we need to manage the risks of warming with the knowledge we have.' The study found 63% of uncertainty in projected warming was due to single sources – such as climate sensitivity, followed by future behaviour of the carbon cycle and the cooling effect of aerosols – while 37% of uncertainty came from the combination of these sources. 'This means that if any single uncertainty is reduced – even the most important, climate sensitivity – significant uncertainty will remain,' Dr Bodman said. Professor Karoly said the study reinforced the importance of strong action on climate change. 'Our results reconfirm the need for urgent and substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions if the world is to avoid exceeding the global warming target of 2 degrees needed to minimise dangerous climate change,' he said. A typical, simple dinoflagellate associated with the early Oligocene epoch and found in 33 million year-old sediments, helping prove the age of the Antarctic ice cap . The Antarctic continental ice cap came into existence during the Oligocene epoch, some 33.6 million years ago, according to a study of ice sediments. The Integrated Ocean Drilling Program . international expedition has obtained this information from the . paleoclimatic history preserved in sediment in the Antarctic depths. Before the ice covered Antarctica, the Earth was a warm place with a tropical climate. In this region, plankton diversity was high until glaciation reduced the populations - leaving only those capable of surviving in the new climate. The study, published in the journal . Science in April, focused on single-celled plankton called . dinoflagellates, which contain materials that fossilize. Before the . Eocene-Oligocene transition about 34 million years ago, Antarctic . dinoflagellates were extremely diverse. When the ice pack formed, . however, only plankton that could survive cold temperatures and a . seasonal freeze-melt cycle remained. An expedition . led by the Andalusian Institute of Earth Sciences (IACT) has analysed those populations. IACT researcher Carlota Escutia, who led the expedition, said the 'the fossil record of dinoflagellate cyst communities reflects the substantial reduction and specialization of these species that took place when the ice cap became established and, with it, marked seasonal ice-pack formation and melting began'.","Australian team developed new method to predict warming estimates for 2100 .

Some wore homemade body armour and construction hats and carried shields and clubs. There is a sense among opponents and supporters of President Morsi that Sunday's rally is a make-or-break day, increasing worries that the two camps will come to blows despite vows by each to remain peaceful. Some protesters wore homemade body armor and construction hats and carried shields and clubs . Waving Egyptian flags, crowds descended on Tahrir Square in the heart of Cairo, one of a number of sites in the capital and around the country, where rallies have been organised . As the crowds swelled in Tahrir, traffic in the capital's normally clogged streets was light at midday with many residents choosing to stay home for fear of violence . Already at least seven people, including American student Andrew Pochter, 21, have been killed in clashes the past week, mainly in Nile Delta cities and the coastal city of Alexandria. Today's demonstrations, which have fallen on the anniversary of Morsi's inauguration as Egypt's first freely elected leader, are the culmination of growing polarisation since he took office. President Morsi has said he has no plans to meet the protesters' demand for an early presidential election . In one camp are the president and his Islamist allies, including the Muslim Brotherhood and more hard-line groups. They have vowed to defend Morsi, saying street demonstrations cannot be allowed to remove a freely elected leader. The other is an array of secular and liberal Egyptians as well as moderate Muslims and Christians. They say the Islamists have overstepped their election mandate, accusing them of trying to monopolise power and mismanage the country. The opposition believes that with sheer numbers in the street, it can pressure Morsi to step down. 'Today, the people will triumph over fascism,' prominent pro-democracy campaigner and bestselling novelist Alaa al-Aswany wrote on his Twitter account. Police have seized firearms, explosives and even artillery shells around the country in an attempt to prevent violence. In an interview published on Sunday in The Guardian, Morsi - who has three years left in term - said he had no plans to meet the protesters' demand for an early presidential election. 'If we changed someone in office who (was elected) according to constitutional legitimacy - well, there will (be) people or opponents opposing the new president too, and a week or a month later, they will ask him to step down,' said Morsi. 'There is no room for any talk against this constitutional legitimacy,' he said. As the crowds swelled in Tahrir, traffic in the capital's normally clogged streets was light at midday with many residents choosing to stay home for fear of violence or a wave of crime similar to the one that swept Egypt during the 18-day, anti-Mubarak uprising.

Banks were closing early and most government departments were either closed for the day or were thinly staffed. Most schools and colleges are already closed for the summer holidays. Thousands of Morsi's supporters have staged a sit-in since Friday in front of the Rabia al-Adawiya Mosque near the Ittihadiya presidential palace. In the evening, anti-Morsi crowds plan to march on the palace and Morsi supporters have vowed to defend it if it is attacked. The opposition protests emerged from a petition campaign by a youth activist group known as Tamarod, Arabic for 'rebel.' For several months, the group has been collecting signatures calling for Morsi to step down. On Saturday the group announced it had more than 22 million signatures - proof, it claims, that a broad sector of the public no longer wants Morsi in office. Morsi's supporters have questioned the authenticity and validity of the signatures. An Egyptian woman kisses a poster of President Mohamed Morsi . Egyptians opposing President Morsi wave their national flag while one of them wears chains and a face mask . Student Andrew Pochter, 21, died while photographing clashes between opponents and supporters of President Mohamed Morsi in Alexandria, Egypt . Morsi, who has three years left in his presidential term, claims that Mubarak loyalists are behind the planned protests. His supporters say Tamarod is a cover for thugs loyal to Mubarak. The 22 million signatures, while they have no legal weight, deal a symbolic blow to Morsi at a time when he is widely seen by Egyptians to have failed to tackle the country's most pressing problems, from surging crime rates and high unemployment to fuel shortages and power outages. If verified, the number of people who signed the petition calling on Morsi to step down would be nearly twice the number who voted for him a year ago in a run-off that he won with around 52 per cent of the vote.

"A new study about forced labour in former communist East Germany shows how companies like Ikea, Siemens and Aldi profited enormously from the slave workers who toiled for them in grim factory jails. Ikea has shelled out £100,000 on a warts-and-all look into the dark practice of selling items made in the totalitarian state's penal system after allegations about the practice surfaced two years ago. The 500 page report was presented in Berlin on Monday. Political scientist Christian Sachse, the author, said: 'The west knew these products were made by forced labour which was forbidden under international conventions.' A new study about forced labour in former communist East Germany shows how companies like Ikea, Siemens and Aldi profited enormously from the slave workers who toiled for them in grim factory jails . In 2012 Ikea had officially admitted that it had sold furniture which had been produced by prisoners of the German Democratic Republic, Soviet Russia's most hardline ally in the eastern bloc. Shelves, sofas and a host of other home furnishings were churned out in their thousands by men and women imprisoned because of their opposition to the regime under which they lived. Ikea was not alone. The study shows that a substantial portion of the West German 'economic miracle' came as a result of the slaves put to work in the east with 6,000 firms in all using them. Others included engineering giant Krupp, telecommunications company Mannesmann and the oxygen manufacturer Linde. The study says East Germany put some 15,000 prisoners to work making the products for which the state received much needed hard currency. The Stasi secret police ran the slave programme. The study says that cynical leaders in East Germany put prisoners to work from 1949 onwards - first in the steel mills and coal mines - and later in the factory prisons churning out the western consumer goods . Products from the GDR were attractive to the west because they were so much cheaper than those produced domestically. The study says that cynical leaders in East Germany put prisoners to work from 1949 onwards - first in the steel mills and coal mines - and later in the factory prisons churning out the western consumer goods. It also criticised the West German practice of paying cash for political prisoners to be released. This, said the author, encouraged the regime to seize others, brand them as dissidents, and hold them to ransom too. The author said; 'Political prisoners were themselves export goods.' Roland Jahn, the head of the Stasi document service in Berlin, saiod forced labour in Eastern . German prisons, said: 'The dictatorship used prisoners in violation of human rights, who had to work under inhumane conditions. 'But it is also important to stress the responsibility of the Western companies. 'The companies must ask themselves whether this was too easy for them. Many western companies still don't know about their involvement in this slave labour programme and I would like them to show more interest in learning about it.' Ikea says the results of the study have brought about a change in the company's corporate culture. 'Today we have a clear code of conduct,' said a spokesman.","Ikea has shelled out £100,000 on a warts-and-all look into the dark practice .

"A man has told how he was taken on a 'death roll' by a crocodile as he hunted near a creek but managed to escape when he poked the beast in the eye. Stephen Moreen, 20, was hunting pigs, geese and emu in Peppimenarti, 320 kilometres south-west of Darwin, in the Northern Territory, about 7.20pm on Friday when he waded into the water to collect a water fowl that a member of the group he was with had shot. He was in a two metres of water when the crocodile struck, latching its giant jaws on to his arm. Scroll down for video .

Mr Moreen was transported by Care Flight to Darwin Royal Hospital for further attention to his numerous wounds . The animal, thought to be 2m long, dragged Mr Moreen underwater. 'We were shooting geese, my cousin-brother told me go and get the duck there,' Mr Moreen told the ABC from the Peppimenarti Community Health Clinic. 'I just walked. I got the first goose, the second one, then the number three one, he grabbed my on my arm. 'The croc did the death-roll. Lucky for me when we went underwater I saw him and poked his eye. He let go. Once he let go he ran for the bank. Then my cousin-brother shot him.' Mr Moreen's sister-in-law, who was in the hunting party, was able to give him first aid before they took him on a quad bike to the nearby Wudaduk Outstation, where he waited for an ambulance.

I'm fine, I'm alive. It could have been bad. It could have got my leg. I was about waist deep. 'I have a scratch on my back, the rest on my arm. He ripped out a bit of skin and left me with two to three holes.' The 20-year-old was hunting for geese in wetlands near Wudaduk Outstation, about 20 kilometres from the remote community of Peppimenarti in the Top End . The man was attacked by a crocodile, estimated to be about two metres in length when he waded into the water to recover a goose he had shot . Bart Irwin, the head of the Northern Territory branch of Field and Game Australia, advises against hunting in dark conditions . Superintendent Louise Jorgensen told Daily Mail Australia: 'Like a true Territorian, he wrestled the crocodile and was able to shake it off finally by poking its eyes. 'He was conveyed to Darwin via Care Flight for further attention to the numerous puncture wounds, tears and claw marks to his arm and back. He is one lucky man.' The hunting of waterfowls is an ancient tradition in the Northern Territory. This year's hunting season started on September 12. Bart Irwin, the head of the Northern Territory branch of Field and Game Australia said retrieving birds from marshlands is too dangerous, and that hunters should be using dogs. He told the ABC: 'I'd hate to lose one of my dogs. I try and hunt in areas where I don't put them in danger – but better them than me. I love my dogs but I love my legs.' Mr Irwin said Mr Moreen was probably also hunting too late in the day. 'That sort of darkness gives the crocs the upper hand,' he said.","20-year-old Stephen Moreen had a wrestling match with a crocodile before poking its eyes and managing to escape on Friday night .
He was 'mildly intoxicated' before the attack, and he drunk more afterwards to numb the pain .
Mr Moreen said 'I have a scratch on my back, the rest on my arm. He ripped out a bit of skin and left me with two to three holes.'

"Party goers in Brisbane got the shock of their lives after they challenged a group of 'bored' looking police officers to a dance off and they actually accepted. The Brisbane CBD may have been the location of all things serious with the G20 coming to town on the weekend but a team of seven police officers effectively lightened the mood a little. The Courier Mail reported that just after midnight on Sunday morning, day two of the G20 leaders' summit, Tina Turner's infectious 'Nutbush City Limits' came blasting from pub 'Irish Murphy's' on the corner of George and Elizabeth streets, just outside a restricted security zone. Scroll down to video . Brisbane police officers (pictured) busting a move to 'nutbush' while working at the G20 in the CBD . Onlookers (pictured) were amazed at the cops taking up the challenge to dance to the nutbush . Brisbane couple David and Leah License decided that before they went home they'd break out in the 'nutbush' dance moves right there on the footpath. Then in spectacular fashion, the group of officers across the street from them, then busted out their own moves with onlookers cheering and laughing at the site. On completion of their show of skills, everyone in the street applauded loudly. 'We couldn’t believe it, all the police did it, it was just hilarious, it was such a good night,' Leah Licence told The Courier Mail. Not wanting to miss the moment, Mr License took a video of the funny interaction and said he was delighted to see that the officers were out there having a good time, despite being on duty. Dance anyone? These Brisbane police officers obviously like the Tina Turner song 'nutbush' Brisbane police officer shocked onlookers by busting a move on the street while working at the G20 on Sunday . 'They were looking pretty bored where they were standing, doing their job of course, but I think by about midnight the leaders were all tucked up in bed,' Mr Licence told The Courier Mail. With a group of friends the couple said they had walked from South Bank to across the city passing a number of police stationed a various points for the G20. Hearing reports through media that the CBD was like a ghost town they decided to go out and have some fun, getting a little more than they bargained for. Acting Sergeant Brendon Winslow said it's a fine balance at major events like the G20. 'First and foremost the role of officers during the G20 was to be ambassadors for the Service and for Australia while ensuring the safety and security of the G20 Leaders’ Summit,' he said in a statement. 'The Queensland Police Service fully supports these officers and we believe we got this balance right.'","Brisbane police officers break out into 'nutbush' on day two of the G20 leaders' summit .

"With a value of £1,250, a tank that can hold 10 litres of water and a firing range of 40ft, it is said to be the world's most sophisticated machine gun water pistol. Engineer Alex Bygrave, 27, of Streatham Hill, south London, spent 50 hours designing and building the first-ever Gatling-style water pistol from scratch - using 55 separate parts from everyday life.

"More than 100 staff at a bank that employs Tony Blair as an adviser were each paid an average salary package of more than £2million in 2012. Documents disclosed by JP Morgan to European regulators show that 126 of the US bank’s London-based employees were paid £41million in salaries and a further £222million in bonuses. The 2012 average was a slight fall from the £2.2million average seen in 2011, but it will spark new concerns over fat-cat pay. JP Morgan's top UK staff were each paid an average £2million in 2012, new documents show. Pictured here is JP Morgan Chase's building in New York . Earlier this week, Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, said foreign-owned banks in the City were ‘in denial’ over the financial crisis, while Goldman Sachs said 115 of its executives pocketed £3million each in 2012 – up 50 per cent on 2011. Despite the fall, the scale of the hand-outs will infuriate campaigners who believe not enough is being done to bring bankers pay into line. The Archbishop has said many bankers did not understand how the industry’s culture of high risk and reckless pursuit of profit had brought the global economy to its knees. Mr Blair, who would not be among the 126 top bankers because he is a part-time consultant, was hired in 2008 by JP Morgan. He earns around £2million a year in his role as adviser to the Wall Street bank. Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair was hired in 2008 by JP Morgan . Banks have been forced to provide greater transparency on pay due to tighter regulations from the EU aimed at reducing eye-watering rewards. New rules limiting what banks in the European Union can pay in bonuses came into force yesterday. Banks will be banned from paying bonuses worth more than a banker’s annual salary, or twice as much as their pay if sanctioned by shareholders. But most banks are expected to raise basic pay in order to offset the decline. Yesterday it also emerged that Ross McEwan, chief executive of state-backed RBS was handed £1.5million in free shares on December 31, as compensation for missing out on bonuses at his previous job.","The 2012 average was a slight fall from £2.2million average seen in 2012 .

"This is the picture which last night intensified pressure on the head of the Government’s child abuse inquiry to resign. It shows Fiona Woolf with Lady Brittan, the wife of former Home Secretary Lord Brittan, at an awards ceremony in October 2013. This is despite Mrs Woolf telling MPs that she had had no social contact with the Brittans since April 2013. Victims of sexual abuse, their lawyers and MPs last night called for Mrs Woolf to resign over her dinner-party links to Lord Brittan, who is likely to be called to give evidence to the inquiry about allegations – which he denies – that he was at the centre of an Establishment cover-up of sex abuse claims. Fiona Woolf (left) was with Lady Brittan (right) at the 2013 Dragon Awards at Mansion House in October last year - alongside journalist Martyn Lewis (centre) - but did not mention this meeting to MPs . There are calls for Fiona Woolf to quit after she admitted she entertained former Home Secretary Leon Brittan and his wife three times at dinner parties at her house, and twice went to his central London home for dinner . Corporate lawyer Mrs Woolf, who lives in the same Central London street as the Brittans, wrote a letter to Home Secretary Theresa May, in which she claimed her last social contact with Lady Brittan had been in April 2013. Mrs Woolf, the Lord Mayor of London,boasted of having ‘carefully checked through my records’ to ensure she had not missed anything when she wrote to Mrs May. And she told MPs this week she had ‘gone the extra distance’ to produce an exhaustive list of contacts. Last night a Home Office source insisted it was a ‘minor omission’, but Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs queued up to demand her resignation. Critics said that, even if the mistake was an oversight, it did not bode well for the chairman of a sensitive inquiry to have such a flimsy grasp of the facts. As Downing Street and the Home Office desperately tried to prop up their candidate: . But the emergence of the picture was the most damaging revelation. It shows Mrs Woolf QC and Lady Brittan talking to former BBC newsreader Martyn Lewis at the Dragon Awards in October 2013. All three were judges of the awards, which recognise City firms’ contribution to the community. In her letter to Mrs May, Mrs Woolf said: ‘I have had no further social contact with Lord and Lady Brittan since April 23, 2013, and have not spoken to either of them in person or by telephone since, other than disclosed in this letter.’ She told the Home Secretary that she and Lady Brittan were ‘both judges for the Dragon Awards in 2014’, adding the extra detail that Lady Brittan did not attend the 2014 awards ceremony. But she makes absolutely no mention in her letter of the 2013 awards. Then on Tuesday this week, she offered additional reassurance to the Home Affairs Select Committee, telling its members: ‘I have gone the extra distance to make sure I have dug out any possible connection.’ Her assertion unravelled within 24 hours as the new photo emerged. Home Secretary Theresa May has insisted the inquiry can go ahead, despite the chairman's links to Leon Brittan (right, with his wife) On Tuesday, she offered additional reassurance to the home affairs select committee, saying: ‘I have gone the extra distance to make sure I have dug out any possible connection.’ Her assertion unravelled within 24 hours as the new photo emerged. Last night committee chairman Keith Vaz said he was ‘surprised’ by the new information. He added: ‘It is important to give her the opportunity, as I will do when I write to her, to ask her why this particular piece of information was missing.’ Lord Brittan is accused of burying a dossier given to him by MP Geoffrey Dickens in 1983. It documented the alleged involvement of VIP figures in a child sex ring. He has denied the claims. These are the unanswered questions: . In her letter to Mrs May, Mrs Woolf made the damning admission that she had entertained the former Home Secretary and his wife three times at dinner parties at her house, and twice went to their home for dinner. But despite their social and professional contacts, she insisted she did not have a ‘close association’ with the peer. Lord Brittan is accused of ignoring, or burying, a dossier given to him by MP Geoffrey Dickens in 1983, allegedly documenting the involvement of VIP figures in a child sex ring. He denies the claims. Mrs Woolf made no further comment yesterday. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘Fiona Woolf has written to the Home Secretary setting out any issues, including her involvement in the Dragon Awards, which might be seen to cast doubt on her impartiality. ‘The Home Secretary is confident that this panel, under the chairmanship of Fiona Woolf CBE, will carry out a robust and thorough inquiry, and will challenge institutions without fear or favour, in order to get to the bottom of this issue and stop it from happening again.’ But Labour MP Caroline Flint said: ‘I just don’t think at this stage it’s viable that she’s the person that leads this.’ Asked if Mrs Woolf had the confidence of people involved in the inquiry, Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude told the BBC: ‘I think she will need to show that and time will tell.’ A lawyer representing victims said her social relationship with Lord Brittan put her ‘beyond the pale in terms of her credibility’. Alison Millar said ‘evidence of dinner parties with Lord Brittan really puts her beyond the pale in terms of her credibility with my clients’. Lib Dem MP John Hemming called on Mrs Woolf to stand down, calling her appointment a mistake. One of the two victims of abuse sitting on the panel, Sharon Evans, said the inquiry had got off to a ‘very difficult start’. The Home Secretary's first choice to lead the inquiry into historic child abuse was Baroness Butler-Sloss (left), but she was forced to step down because her brother was the Government's attorney general.  Labour MP Simon Danczuk called for her to stand down . Has she misled Parliament? If MPs conclude Mrs Woolf deliberately misled Parliament – of which there is no evidence – she could be hauled back before them to correct what she said. Under an antiquated procedure last used decades ago, she could theoretically be forced to come to the House of Commons to be admonished publicly by the Speaker. It is known as being ‘called to the bar of the House of Commons’. The last time a non-MP was summoned to the bar was on 24 January 1957. In addition, any MP can table a motion calling for the House of Commons to censure someone.","Theresa May appointed Fiona Woolf  after her original choice quit .

"Two men who laughed during a horrific 'gang rape' of a drunken woman . have had their sentences slashed after three senior judges ruled they were not 'dangerous'. Rezgar Nouri, 27, of Preston, and Mohammed Ibrahim, 24, of London, were jailed indeterminately after being convicted of assaulting the 24-year-old in Preston last June. Sitting at the Court of Appeal, Lord Justice Hooper, Mr Justice Silber and Mr Justice Hamblen heard how the men 'came across' the woman before taking her to a flat where Ibrahim pinned her down while . another man raped her. Three appeal judges ruled there was 'insufficient evidence' that Nouri and Ibrahim should be defined as 'dangerous' After that, Ibrahim raped her before Nouri 'grabbed' her and 'dragged' her into a bedroom where he raped her, judges . were told. But today, despite the evidence, they ruled at the Royal Courts of Justice there was 'insufficient evidence' that Nouri and Ibrahim should be defined as 'dangerous'. They said Judge Anthony Russell QC had . been wrong to decide that 'imprisonment for public protection' was . necessary and hand down a jail sentence which gave the men no automatic . right of release. They allowed the men's appeal against the imposition of an indeterminate sentence and instead handed each a 12-year term.

Judges said the woman was found in a 'very . distressed state' shortly after she left the flat and police were . called. Mr Justice Hamblen said that before 'imprisonment for the public protection' could be imposed, courts had to be satisfied that there was a 'significant risk' to the public of serious harm through the 'commission of further specified offences'.

"Cherie Blair has bought yet another block of flats – just weeks after snapping up ten apartments in Manchester. She and eldest son Euan have purchased 14 apartments in nearby Stockport – dramatically increasing the family’s property empire to 31 homes. The total would have been 32, but earlier this month Mrs Blair, 60, sold the notorious ‘Cheriegate’ flat in Bristol she bought with the help of convicted Australian fraudster Peter Foster in 2002. Scroll down for video . Cherie Blair has purchased yet another block of flats - this time purchasing 14 apartments in Stockport . The block of 14 apartments in Stockport, Greater Manchester, on the site of a former scrapyard . She finally found a buyer after slashing the asking price from £330,000 to £315,000 – making a £52,500 profit on the home she bought 12 years ago for £262,500. The apartments in the North West appear to be more lucrative opportunities, with property prices rising faster there than anywhere else in the country, including London. Alexander Zolghadriha of Manchester-based Melk Properties, which formerly owned the homes, called the Blairs’ latest purchase a ‘good investment’. He said: ‘The flats are popular with young professionals in Stockport, and were always full when we owned them.’ His firm sold the block – based on the site of a former scrap metal dealer – for more than £1million. Last month the Blairs snapped up this ten-flat block in Urmston, Manchester, for £650,000 . As well as the buy-to-let flats in the North West, the Blairs have a considerable portfolio of private homes for themselves and their children. One of Tony and Cherie’s two London properties is a £3.65million five-storey Georgian townhouse, which they bought in 2004. Three years later they snapped up the £800,000 mews house behind it – and have since paid off the mortgage. In 2008 they bought a £5.75million Grade I listed Buckinghamshire manor house. A £1.35million four-storey Georgian property in the capital was bought for son Nicky, 28, last year – paid for in cash. And the couple also paid £600,000 in cash for a three-bedroom cottage in Buckinghamshire for Mr Blair’s sister Sarah the same year. They also purchased a £3.62million townhouse in the capital for Euan, 30, and his wife Suzanne. The £1.2million mews property behind it was bought for daughter Kathryn, 26, in March. Another firm, Cravelane Limited, which owned the flats briefly over the summer, sold it to the Blairs via their property company Oldbury Residential Ltd. Apartments in the area are rented at about £450 a month, suggesting the Blairs could reap about £75,000 a year as the landlords of the modern block, which is next to a pub in a relatively run-down part of Stockport. No details are known about the price paid for the property – purchased with the help of a mortgage – but it is likely to be about double the £650,000 they splashed out on a ten-flat block last month in Urmston, Manchester. That property – where tenants include a Tory councillor – could earn the Blairs £55,000 a year in rent payments. Sources close to the family say they are buying properties in the Manchester area as investments. Tony Blair, who earns millions from global consultancy work, has insisted that reports of his £100million wealth are ‘greatly exaggerated’. However, the Blairs have built a large property empire – even though Mrs Blair encountered controversy in 2002 when she bought two Bristol flats with a discount negotiated by conman Foster – who was dating Mrs Blair’s confidante Carole Caplin – at the time.","Cherie Blair and eldest son Euan have bought 14 apartments in Stockport .

"A Los Angeles TV producer pulled off an epic Thanksgiving Twitter take-down of an apparently horrid fellow passenger on his flight to Phoenix yesterday that ended with the middle-aged woman slapping him in the face. Elan Gale, whose Twitter bio says he's a producer on ABC's The Bachelor, began tweeting from the airport around 11 a.m. on Thanksgiving, after learning his flight was running behind schedule. What came next was a blow by blow account, from 30,000 feet, of his note-passing battle with 'Diane from 7A' that would put most 7th graders to shame. Twitter war: Elan Gale, pictured, whose Twitter bio says he's a producer on ABC's The Bachelor, began tweeting from the airport about midday on Thanksgiving . 'Our flight is delayed. A woman on here is very upset because she has Thanksgiving plans. She is the only one obviously. Praying for her,' the long-haired, bearded Gale began. He added: 'She's telling the flight attendants that it is Thanksgiving. She wants them to know she wants to have dinner with her family.' According to Gale, the woman was getting pretty irate at the prospect of being late for her holiday dinner. 'The male flight attendant said ""I understand ma'am. I'm looking forward to seeing my family too."" She responded ""This isn't about you,""' Gale tweeted. 'Her family is very important to her, she says. Her family has a special recipe for stuffing. She needs to be there to help. It is crucial,' he wrote in a follow up. First encounter: Gale's first tweet, pictured, on the subject revealed his flight was delayed that one passenger was particularly pissed off . Annoying: The woman continued to complain, according to Gale . Up in the air: Once seated, he bought he a glass of wine and wrote the woman, later revealed to be called Diane, a note, pictured . Gale said the woman couldn't believe that she might be late, and she wanted everyone to know about it. 'She has a connecting flight. Why doesn't anyone understand she has a connecting flight? Why do people not understand her needs?' he tweeted. Finally, the plane took off, but the hilarious tit-for-tat was just getting started. 'She had to sit down because we took off. She has been muttering ""about DAMN time"" and I can hear her breathing from 5 rows back,' he tweeted, from up in the air. That's when he decided to send her a glass of red wine. And a note. He took a picture of both for the pleasure of his 35,000 twitter followers who, if they were already sick to death of their own Thanksgivings, would have been following the action closely. Upset: Though Gale, pictured, may have been the most confrontational, others on board were also aware of the impolite woman's behavior, he said . Enjoying the action: After the wine, Gale gave the woman two small bottles of vodka that the assistant handed him, after which he was a little nervous . The note read: 'Dear Lady in 7A, It has come to my attention that today is your 'Thanksgiving!' It must be hard to not be with your family. Please accept this glass of wine. It is a gift from me to you. 'Hopefully if you drink it, you won't be able to use your mouth to talk. Love Elan.' Though he may have been the most confrontational, others on board were also aware of the impolite woman's behavior, he said. 'The male flight attendant is giving me the ""let's just pretend this never happened"" face. Shaking his head a lot,' he tweeted, before adding that the host took him aside. 'He gave me two little bottles of vodka but he won't hand them to her. He says I have to do it myself.' He told the Twittersphere 'I'm going to do it.' Then four minutes later, he wrote: 'Oh my God I did it I walked as if I was going to the bathroom and I leaned over and put them on her tray table and walked away Oh my God.' He said, in response, the woman just stared at him 'really hard,' and was breathing through her teeth. But he was clearly enjoying the altercation. Retaliation: But the woman, Diane, struck back wit her own note, pictured . Warpath: 'This means war,' he tweeted, before sending out a description of his opponent to his tens of thousands of followers . 'I'm not going to lie I am shaking this is so terrifying she is so angry at me it's kind of incredible,' he tweeted. 'I don't really know what to do now I'm afraid to get out of my seat. This is like being on a roller coaster I'm scared and super excited.' But that's when the woman struck back. 'The male flight attendant just handed me a note from 7A,' he tweeted before posting a picture of the letter from 'Diane.' 'Dear 'Elan,' The wine wasn't funny. The vodka wasn't funny. You're an awful person with no compassion. I'm sorry for your family that they should have to deal with you. - Diane.' 'This means war,' he tweeted, before sending out a description of his opponent to his tens of thousands of followers. Another note: Gale hit back with another note in which he told 'Diane' to stay home next time she was in a bad mood . Seat: He also took a photo of the woman's seat, pictured . 'Diane is in her late 40s or early 50s. She is wearing mom jeans and a studded belt and she is wearing a medical mask over her idiot face,' he tweeted. In an amusing effort, he even tweeted at US Airways in a bid to get her kicked off the flight 30,000 feet in the air. '@USAirwaysHelp hi I find a passenger on one of your planes to be annoying. If I give you money will you remove her? I want to buy her seat,' he wrote. But decided another note, which he said he was considering 'balling up in my mouth and spitting it into her tray table,' was his best retaliation approach. He tweeted a picture of her seat number and then his response note before delivering it. It read: 'Dear 'Diane,' Thank you for your lovely note. The person who lacks compassion is you. We all want to get home, particularly the nice men and women who fly your lazy ass around and serve you drinks (you're welcome!) Next time you're in a bad mood, stay home. I hate you very much. Eat my d***' Love 'Elan.' Tit-for-tat: Diane's next note, pictured, read: '""Elan"" This is inappropriate beyond belief. I will be speaking to the authorities when we land' Rude: But the producer couldn't leave it there, and sent another note to Diane, referring again to his genitalia . Violent: In a violent twist of fate, it was Diane who may have been in trouble with the authorities when they landed . Diane shot back with her own threat. It was getting heated. '""Elan"" This is inappropriate beyond belief. I will be speaking to the authorities when we land.' But the producer couldn't leave it there. With the comment, 'My final (I think) note to Diane in 7A,' he posted a picture of his latest offering, 'Dear ""Diane"" When you speak to the authorities, please make sure they arrest you for cannibalism because you just ate my d***!' Love Elan.' However, in a violent twist of fate, it was Diane who may have been in trouble with the authorities when they landed. 'Well, ""Diane just slapped me,' Gale tweeted. Final note: In a last note, after the slapping, Gale gave Diane his Twitter handle and told her to read all his tweets . Signing off: Signing off, Gale added once more for measure 'eat my d***' He later explained, on his connecting flight to LAX, how it all played out. 'When I got off the plane I waited for her at the gate. I was holding another note in my hand and I was going to give it to her,' he tweeted. 'She walked right up to me and slapped me immediately in the face.' He said the gate agent for the next flight actually grabbed her and held her back before asking Gale if he wanted the airport police called. He said 'no,' as Diane turned to ask the same agent whether she'd make her connecting to Sacramento. 'He said ""no,""' Gale tweeted. He said he laughed and the agent asked again if he wanted to call the police. Again he said no, but he did have one last note for her. It read: 'Diane, allow me to introduce myself. I am TheYearOfElan. Look me up online. read every tweet. Read every response. And maybe next time you'll be nice to people who are just trying to help.' And signing off he wrote, 'PS Eat my d***. Love Elan.'

The woman responsible for 26-year-old Fleur's cool new look is Gemma Sheppard, who has worked with the likes of Dannii Minogue, and helps curate each and every look for the live shows. Scroll down for video . Confident contestant: X Factor hopeful Fleur East looked on-trend in a super luxe outfit of Dolce and Gabbana, Moschino, DKNY and vintage Chanel, which the show's stylist said 'screamed cool' 'That girl has an incredible body and she knows how to show it off in a sexy, strong way,' Gemma told MailOnline. 'Her song choice on Saturday night called for a very cool look. I love a varsity jacket over a bra - it's a whole stage vibe and a leopard print mixed with a print screams cool.' Gemma believes that fashion is an 'emotional tool' and if you look good, you feel good. 'It's all about confidence and getting inside of the contestant's heads,' she said. 'It is their closest moment to becoming a pop star so I want that to be translated in what they're wearing.' Showcasing her assets: Gemma Sheppard, who styled the contestants, said that Fleur has an incredible body and she knows how to show it off in a sexy, strong way' Behind the scenes: Gemma Instagrammed this snap of Fleur with the caption: 'There is no SHAME in looking so swag baby girl' She continued: 'For 80s week we simply saluted the decade, I didn't want to play dress up with the contestants and make them look like they're in fancy dress on their way to a rollersdisco. 'There's actually a lot of 80s inspired fashion on the high street just now so for this week's looks we were able to mix current season with some vintage pieces.' And it seems that Gemma is working her magic on the contestants; they spoke on the Xtra Factor about how her styling is giving them confidence. 'The contestants need to feel not just comfortable with their styling, but actually empowered by it. Styling isn't about ""telling"" someone what to wear. It's a process that ultimately leads to what they know they need to wear so they can perform at their best for that moment,' she explained. Gemma, who has worked in commercial TV for many years, emphasises that when it comes to styling for live shows, you've got to think of the whole stage production. 'It's not just how you look in the dressing room, you have to consider ‎how the whole package, the music, the dancers, the lights, your make up, will look for the viewer. Lots of the acts have reviewed their performances back and can now see how the styling works with and compliments the creative direction,' she said. New heights: Lola Saunders, who usually favours flat shoes, wore heels on the show and was complimented by the judges. Gemma believes that heels quite literally raise a contestant's game . Another contestant who felt empowered by her styling was Lola Saunders, who Gemma put in heels despite the young singer's penchant for flats. 'Heels, killer heels, I love them. They finesse an outfit and literally help you raise your game,' said Gemma. 'Admittedly some of the girls have said they're more comfortable in trainers, but they've seen their looks back on camera and they understand what a difference completing an outfit with heels can make. 'I also practice what I preach, however long the day, whether I'm at studio, doing pulls from stores or on a shoot I am always, always in heels.' On Sunday, Cheryl's acts Chloe Jasmine and Stephanie Nala were the latest victims of the show. The X Factor Stylist, Jamie Stevens, says: “This is a fantastic twist on the classic ponytail, combining it with a beehive for a high-impact finish.” STEP 1: . Apply TRESemmé Instant Refresh Dry Shampoo (RRP £4.99 for 200ml) to the roots of dry hair and work through for loads of texture and hold. Section the hair just above the ears and secure the lower section into a ponytail at the nape of the neck with an elastic. STEP 2: . Dust TRESemmé 24 Hour Body Plumping Powder (RRP £5.50 for 10g) onto the roots of the lower and upper sections and massage in well to create loads of volume without needing to backcomb. Add the hair from the beehive section to the lower ponytail and secure with another elastic. STEP 3: . Starting at the side of the head, take one inch sections of hair from the top section and secure just above the ponytail using kirby grips. Take a half an inch section of hair from the ponytail and wrap it around the top of the ponytail and pin to secure the look and hide the elastics. For a soft finish, leave some hair loose around the face.","Gemma Sheppard is show's head stylist .

"The decision to use Prince William as the spearhead for England’s 2018 World Cup bid was under scrutiny last night after a controversial inquiry ruled that the FA used corrupt tactics. The England bid was condemned as ‘improper’ yesterday by a FIFA ethics probe, which cleared Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing. The Prince was left ‘bitterly disappointed’ in 2010 when he – along with David Beckham and David Cameron – were ‘stitched up’ in the secret ballot, winning only two of a possible 22 votes, despite having privately secured the pledges of at least five FIFA delegates. Bid team: David Beckham and Prince William were part of the FA delegation in Zurich in 2010 . The trio felt ‘lied to’, according to one England bid member who said it was ‘embarrassing that William and the Prime Minister have lent their good names’ to the project. William was reported to have objected to having to fawn to FIFA officials who had assembled in Zurich to decide which countries should host the World Cup finals of 2018 and 2022. He was quoted as having said: ‘I don’t see why we have to suck up to these people.’ The Premier later shed light on the extent to which William pushed to secure the votes of delegates from FIFA, football’s governing body. Mr Cameron told how he had met the prince coming out of one meeting: ‘He said it had gone really, really well. I said, “Gosh, how did you do it? What did you offer him, an invitation to the royal wedding?” He said, “Prime Minister, I went so far I think I offered to marry him.”’ William was keeping a dignified silence yesterday. But Football Association chairman Greg Dyke described the FIFA claims as ‘a joke’. The report by FIFA ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert was scathing about England’s conduct, including severely reprimanding it for a £35,000 sponsorship of a gala dinner for the then FIFA vice-president Jack Warner in his native Trinidad . It said that the now disgraced Warner had abused his power to exact personal benefits and England ‘showed willingness, time and again, to meet such expectation, thereby damaging the image of FIFA and the bidding process’. Prince William, Beckham and the Prime Minister share a joke at a meeting before the announcement that Russia would host the World Cup in 2018, not England . Russia, which won the 2018 bid, and Qatar, selected as 2022 hosts, were handed a clean bill of health despite suspicions they may have bribed their way to success. Yet just hours after publishing its findings yesterday, FIFA – long dogged by claims of corruption – was rocked when Eckert’s report was disowned by the chief investigator, US lawyer Michael Garcia. Eckert’s 42-page report was a summary of a 430-page report – not published – by Garcia who spent nearly two years investigating the corruption claims on behalf of Fifa. Garcia said the summary contained ‘numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations’. An FA spokesman said: ‘We strongly refute any suggestions of impropriety by those involved in the England bid.’","FA under scrutiny for using Prince William to spearhead World Cup bid .

"Police will have to destroy mugshots of innocent people following a landmark case brought by a 15-year-old. The boy went to court after being told his image would be held until he reached 100 – even though no charges were laid against him. The High Court ruled yesterday that retaining photographs of suspects who have never been charged was a breach of their human rights. Landmark ruling: Lord Justice Richards (left) and Justice Kenneth Parker (right) have told the Met Police it is acting unlawfully by holding photographs of suspects later cleared of any wrongdoing . Police forces will now have to trawl through their records deleting images, including those of people cleared at trial. The teenager from Peckham, South . London, was arrested on suspicion of rape in April 2009 but no charges . were brought when a witness failed to confirm an offence took place. When he asked to have his details . removed he was told the mugshot could be retained until he reached the . age of 100. He was 12 at the time. Blow: Police argued the powers to keep suspect's pictures on file was vital in the fights against crime. (File picture) Human rights: The latest High Court judgement means police cannot hold photos, fingerprints and DNA of people who have not committed a crime . The second claimant was a cyclist . from Chelsea accused of assaulting a police community support officer . who stopped her riding on a footpath in April 2007. Police have faced a series of allegations, over recent years, of creating a Big Brother society after obtaining and keeping innocent citizen's private information. The Met Police were accused of a ‘back-door surveillance scheme’ after it emerged there were harvesting millions of pieces of mobile phone data from people who have never been convicted of any crime. Officers could also access and copy website histories and email content from smart phones, including records of activity on Facebook and other social networking sites. The data, will be stored indefinitely, even if the suspect is either released without charge or, when prosecuted, cleared by the courts, police said. Under the £50,000 scheme, some 16 . terminals designed to harvest the mobile phone data, have been placed in police stations across London and 300 . officers trained to use them. In 2008, the European Court order police to delete the DNA and fingerprints held on a national database from suspects later cleared of wrongdoing. The damning verdict, the 17-strong panel said keeping the records 'could not be regarded as necessary in a democracy'. Before 2001, the police had to destroy DNA samples of individuals acquitted or not charged. But a rule change has allowed them to keep profiles of everyone arrested for a recordable offence in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The details of about 4.5million people are held on the database yet one in five - including 40,000 children - had never been charged with an offence. At the time the Home Office said the register has proved a key intelligence tool in solving 3,500 cases - including high-profile rapes and murders. The 60-year-old, who was described as . of good character, had DNA samples, fingerprints and photographs taken . but the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to charge her with any . offence. When she complained, the Metropolitan Police refused to delete . her record. The force’s policy, which is based on . the Home Secretary’s code of practice, is to retain mugshots for a . minimum of six years, although this can be extended indefinitely. Scotland Yard argued that it was necessary to keep the photographs to . prevent crime and disorder. But Lord Justice Richards said the . policy drew ‘no adequate distinction’ between those who are convicted . and those who are either acquitted or not even charged. The judge, sitting with Mr Justice . Kenneth Parker, concluded: ‘I am not satisfied that the existing policy . strikes a fair balance between the competing public and private . interests and meets the requirements of proportionality. ‘In my judgment, therefore, the . retention of the claimants’ photographs in application of the existing . policy amounts to unjustified interference with their right to respect . for their private life and is in breach of Article 8 of the European . Convention on Human Rights.’ The judge granted the force a few months to revise their policy. Home Secretary Theresa May now has two weeks to lodge an appeal on the ruling, which has implications for all police forces. The courts have already ruled that it is unlawful to keep innocent people’s fingerprints and DNA indefinitely. But Lord Justice Richards said the . Met would not have to delete details of the teenage boy’s alleged . offence from the police national computer. Yesterday John Wadham, general . counsel for Equality and Human Rights Commission, which backed the test . case, said: ‘There is no good reason why the police should hold on to . information about people who have not committed any crime.’ A Home Office spokesman said: ‘We are urgently examining the implications of today’s ruling.’","Country's most senior judges rule it 'unlawful' for police to hold onto the data of innocent citizens .

"The Care Quality Commission has identified 1,200 GP practices in England which may not be providing safe care (file picture, posed by model) One in six GP surgeries could be putting tens of thousands of patients at risk, according to the NHS watchdog. The Care Quality Commission has identified 1,200 practices in England which may not be providing safe care, including 864 it has categorised as of ‘highest concern’. Failings include misdiagnosing cancer, inadequate care of the elderly and making patients wait too long for appointments. CQC chief inspector Professor Steve Field said most surgeries were managing to provide good care despite high demand, but added: ‘We’re sadly finding some very poor practices. ‘These typically are chaotic, have very poor leadership and a lack of learning culture. They also have a poor skill mix – some don’t have any nurses. 'Patients could be at risk by simple things such as by prescribing out-of-date medicines and vaccines. ’ The poorly performing surgeries will be prioritised for vigorous, day-long spot checks over the next two years, which could lead to the worst being closed down. Preliminary assessments of nearly all 8,000 surgeries in England were carried out as part of a new Ofsted-style ratings system based on 38 categories covering safety and basic care. The surgeries have been placed into one of six categories ranging from ‘highest concern’ to ‘lowest concern’. Patients can go to the CQC website to see how their surgery is performing in comparison with neighbouring practices and how they rate according to national standards. Criteria include detection rates for cancer and dementia, opening hours, giving patients the flu jab and the numbers of frail, elderly patients ending up in A&E because they are not properly looked after. The consequences for patients of any one of these failings can be catastrophic. Scroll down for video . Several practices have been identified as having high rates of patients whose cancers are only detected in A&E – because the GP failed to diagnose it in previous appointments. By this stage, the cancer has often spread to other organs and may have become untreatable. The CQC also identified 217 surgeries which could be putting young women at risk by not offering them screening for cervical cancer. A further 228 are making patients wait far too long to see a doctor or nurse. The surgeries were given a score for each of the 38 indicators. These were added together to give an overall score, with the final result determining which of the six bands they were placed in. There were 864 surgeries in band 1 (‘highest concern’) and 332 in band 2. By comparison there were 3,979 surgeries in band 6 (‘lowest concern’). Failings identified by the health watchdog include misdiagnosing cancer, inadequate care of the elderly and making patients wait too long for appointments. It has categorised 864 surgeries as of ‘highest concern’ Prof Field, who is also a GP in Edgbaston, Birmingham, added: ‘GPs are under a lot of pressure but they are demonstrating that even in deprived areas they can provide fantastic care. I do have concerns about access to practices. But we need to do more to encourage people to take better care of themselves and to make better use of pharmacies.’ Prof Field said he expected that only about 160 practices (two per cent) would be put in special measures, where officials from NHS England would step in and instruct them to make urgent improvements. If these are not carried out, the surgeries could be closed down and patients taken on by others nearby. Roger Goss, of Patient Concern, said: ‘The patients at these high-risk practices should be told so they have the option of going elsewhere. ‘That is part of the NHS’s duty of candour, its obligation to be honest and open. Over the past 18 months there has been a rise in the number of patients contacting us with concerns – most notably not being able to get an appointment, which is fundamental.’ GPs are being warned not to close early over the festive period. NHS officials have written to surgeries over concerns they will close their doors mid-afternoon on Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve when it is traditionally quiet. Last year NHS England found that one in 20 GPs had shut by 4pm and left patients in the hands of out-of-hours firms. A letter sent to practices last week – obtained by Pulse magazine – reminds them that Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve are ‘normal working days’. Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients’ Association, added: ‘The NHS must be open and transparent and patients should be provided with as much information as possible about their GP practice. ‘We know that if patients are provided with information, they are able to make more meaningful choices about their healthcare. The more transparent and honest a GP surgery and its staff are, the more confidence the public will have in the system.’ Patients can check their surgery’s rating by going to www.cqc.org.uk/content/our-intelligent-monitoring-gp-practices and inserting their postcode. However, the website has already been criticised by some patients as being riddled with jargon and difficult to interpret. Joyce Robins, co-director of Patient Concern, said: ‘There are just too many patients and not enough doctors. Many are just stretched to the limit and that is why so many patients are ending up in A&E.’ Dr Maureen Baker, chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners, added: ‘Many practices are struggling to meet quality standards due to factors beyond their control, such as lack of funding, significant increases in patient consultations and difficulties in trying to recruit sufficient GPs to meet patients’ needs.’ Mike Bewick, deputy medical director at NHS England, said: ‘We’re pleased this report shows that despite the increased pressure on GPs there are so many good and outstanding practices across the country.’","Care Quality Commission: 1,200 practices may not be providing safe care .

"The US Marshall Service is to auction $20million worth of Bitcoins seized during the prosecution of Ross Ulbricht, above, the alleged founder of black-market drugs website, Silk Road . The US Marshals Service is to auction $20 million worth of bitcoins seized during the prosecution of the alleged owner of black-market drugs website Silk Road. The bitcoins were found on a computer authorities claim belonged to Ross Ulbricht who is accused of creating the website where drugs and other illegal items could be purchased. They were then seized under civil forfeiture laws. On Friday the coins were valued at $395.49 each by digital currency news website CoinDesk. The website, said to be the biggest online marketplace for drugs in the world, was taken down by the FBI in October  2013 when police arrested Ulbricht. The website gained worldwide notoriety in 2011 as a black market bazaar where visitors could buy and sell drugs using bitcoins, a form of online cash, almost completely anonymously. An online tool known as a Tor was used to mask the location of the sites servers. Authorities say in pursuing the website, the government has recovered 173,991 bitcoins, including about 144,336 from computer hardware belonging to Ulbricht. The auction, scheduled for December 4, follows an earlier one in June, when 30,000 bitcoins seized during raids on the website in 2013 were sold. In January Ulbricht agreed to let the government sell the coins. The proceeds of the sale were to be held pending the outcome of his case. Those wanting to buy the 50,000 bitcoins, available in blocks of 20, have until December 1 to register their interest. Successful bidders were to be notified four days later. The remaining 94,341 bitcoins from Ulbricht's hardware will be auctioned 'in the coming months', Lynne Donahue, a Marshals Service spokeswoman, told Asiaone Digital. Silicon Valley venture capitalist Tim Draper brought all of the bitcoins offered in the first auction. It is not known how much he purchased them for. Ulbricht, who prosecutors say was known online as 'Dread Pirate Roberts,' faces charges including conspiracy, narcotics trafficking and continuing criminal enterprise. He is due to stand trial on January 5. The Silk Road website which offered drugs, guns and forged documents for sale was shutdown by the FBI in 2013, but was soon replaced with another version, Silk Road 2.0, seen above . The Silk Road 2.0 website after it was shutdown by U.S. authorities earlier this month . The 30-year-old has denied the charges. Soon after the first raid, a second version of the website was created called Silk Rd 2.0. Earlier this month a British gang of suspected cyber criminals were arrested for their involvement in that website. It was targeted by a joint European and US operation across 17 countries which culminated in the closure of over 400 other websites and services. US agencies also announced the detention of the website's alleged boss Blake Benthall, a 26-year-old from San Francisco. Raids around the world on those responsible for running them led to the seizure of drugs, guns, cash and $1million of virtual currency Bitcoin.","Police closed the drugs website in 2013, with the arrest of Ross Ulbricht .

"These days, police officers are likely to respond to emergencies in a modest Vauxhall Astra or Ford Focus. But back in the Sixties, one cool constabulary got its hands on  a fashionable Triumph convertible to catch criminals. Now, a TR4 acquired by Southend-on-Sea County Borough police in 1962 is expected to sell for a staggering £40,000 at auction. This TR4 acquired by Southend-on-Sea County Borough police in 1962 is expected to sell for a staggering £40,000 at auction. Pictured above in its 1960s' heyday . The nimble sports car, with a top speed of around 110mph, was ideal for pursuing bank robbers who tried to get away in their powerful but heavy Jaguar cars. It is pictured, above, after its restoration . The nimble sports car, with a top speed of around 110mph, was ideal for pursuing bank robbers who tried to get away in their powerful but heavy Jaguar cars. The Triumph was supplied to the force with a number of modifications including a Pye radio, Winkworth bell, air horns and windscreen-mounted, hand-operated lamp. Unlike today's gaudy panda cars, the only police markings were a discreet sign on the front grille and a stop sign on the boot. But one thing it didn't have was seatbelts - with one officer once describing the time he 'hung on to the underside of the seat whilst in fast pursuit'. The Triumph was supplied to the force with a number of modifications including a Pye radio, Winkworth bell, air horns and windscreen-mounted, hand-operated lamp . The car, which has been fully restored to showroom condition, is owned by a Somerset enthusiast who has enlisted Historics Auctions to offer it for sale. Historics, which describe the Triumph as 'exceptional and rare', has given the convertible an estimate of between £35,000 and £40,000. The car is so well known that toy maker Vanguard made a limited edition toy model - complete with '4100HJ' registration plate - which can now be bought on eBay for £15. John Williams, from Historics, said: 'It is in beautiful condition and is a very interesting car which will get you into many classic events. Eventually retired from service in the 1970s, the car was last sold to its current owner in 1991 who decided to restore it to original police specification . 'The TR4 is one of those cars which really needs to be seen. It is a genuine period police car. 'Standard police cars were normally saloons but the odd force would buy something different. This is probably the only one left.' The TR4, a 'fast pursuit car', would be used for two shifts every day, clocking up around 1,000 miles each week. One winter, amid considerable snow and ice, a call came in from Southend Hospital to deliver an urgent drug from London. Unlike today's gaudy panda cars, the only police markings were a discreet sign on the front grille and a stop sign on the boot. Above, a proud Southend officer stands next to the car in the 1960s . There were no helicopters available in those days, so the TR4 was pressed into service and the journey was completed in double quick time despite the conditions. When the weather was good, officers would take advantage of its convertible roof and drive around with the top down while wearing their helmets with chin straps in place. Eventually retired from service in the 1970s, the car was last sold to its current owner in 1991 who decided to restore it to original police specification. It is being sold with a large history file which includes a copy of Advanced Driving Explained by Inspector W H Jobson, priced at one shilling and sixpence, with a picture of 4100 HJ on the cover. The Triumph is one of around 100 classic cars which will be sold at the Historics sale, which takes place at Brooklands, in Weybridge, Surrey, on June 1.","Triumph TR4 owned by Southend-on-Sea constabulary in 1962 .

"Under fire: Fiona Woolf (pictured) faces mounting pressure to quit her role as chairman of the Government's child abuse inquiry due to her links with Lord Brittan . Nick Clegg was condemned by sex assault victims yesterday for giving his support to the under-fire chairman of the Government’s child abuse inquiry. The deputy prime minister offered his backing to Fiona Woolf, who faces mounting pressure to quit over her friendship with Lord Brittan, a possible key witness at the inquiry. Mr Clegg said he had ‘not heard anything’ suggesting she was the wrong choice for the role. But survivors of abuse, including one of his old schoolfriends, accused him of being on ‘a different planet’. Ian McFadyen, who was subjected to violent sexual assaults by two male teachers at Caldicott School in the 1970s, when he was in the same year group as the future Liberal Democrat leader, is spearheading the drive to have Mrs Woolf removed as inquiry chairman. After the deputy prime minister backed Mrs Woolf, Mr McFadyen wrote on Twitter: ‘I’m sorry Mr Clegg, do we live on a different planet?’ Mr McFadyen is behind a High Court challenge demanding a judicial review of Mrs Woolf’s appointment. His lawyer David Burrows told the BBC that corporate lawyer Mrs Woolf, the Lord Mayor of London, ‘cannot be seen to be impartial’ because of her connections with Lord Brittan – the former home secretary who denies failing to act on a dossier of paedophilia allegations he received while in office in the 1980s. There is a growing chorus of victims of sexual abuse, their lawyers and MPs calling for Mrs Woolf to quit. They say she cannot lead an independent inquiry because she is on ‘dinner party terms’ with Lord Brittan, her neighbour in Pimlico, Central London, and he is likely to be a key witness. Peter Saunders, of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, said: ‘Her position is untenable. She has a strong connection to Lord Brittan, who will play an important role in the inquiry. ‘And anyway, she is a corporate lawyer, a member of the Establishment, when what is needed is a criminal judge or a former police chief. We are dealing with an inquiry into serious organised crime.’ Another survivor of abuse, Andi Lavery, said: ‘It is a complete and utter travesty. Fiona Woolf is not a fit and proper person because she knows Lord Brittan. Everyone knows a judge or juror cannot stay on a case if they are on personal terms with one of the witnesses.’ Last night Mrs Woolf was handed a list of ten detailed questions by a powerful Parliamentary committee. Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the House of Commons Home Affairs Committee, asked for answers by next week about missing information from her account of her relationship with Lord and Lady Brittan. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said he had 'not heard anything' to suggest Mrs Woolf wasn't right for the role, despite mounting criticism of her appointment from abuse survivors . Mr Vaz requested to see the ‘first draft’ of Mrs Woolf’s letter to Home Secretary Theresa May, published on Tuesday, and which she admitted was written with the help of Home Office officials. And he asked her to name the official to whom the draft was sent. The explosive letter was her account of her relationship with the Brittans, and detailed their five dinner parties at each other’s houses. He also questioned her about the amount of time she had to work on the inquiry – Mrs Woolf still holds the office of Lord Mayor of London until later this year – as well as what steps she was taking to learn about child abuse, after she admitted she had no experience whatsoever on the subject. Mr Vaz also asked whether a legal challenge to her position as chair could delay the start of the inquiry. Other questions related to matters raised by members of the committee at Tuesday’s hearing.","Child abuse inquiry chairman Fiona Woolf facing mounting pressure to quit .

"Earlier this week, actress Alyssa Milano posted a tender snap on her Instagram page of herself breastfeeding her one-month-old baby girl Elizabella. The 41-year-old  was the picture of maternal bliss in the black and white snap, joining the many other proud celebrity mothers who have chosen to share the intimate moment with friends and fans through social media. The responses to this, like most A-list breastfeeding photographs, has been overwhelming positive. One follower wrote: 'Such a beautiful photo! Thank you for sharing this sweet moment with us, and thank you for helping to normalize breastfeeding!' 'Absolutely beautiful,' another chimed in while a third ventured to write: 'Oh and congratulations on the new baby! I assume you recently gave birth.' Alyssa Milano was the picture of maternal bliss as she breastfed newborn daughter Elizabella in this photo shared via Twitter and Instagram on Monday . The issue of breastfeeding in public has been thrust back into the media spotlight after Emma Bond, 24, was upset after Facebook removed an image of her with baby Carene . Emma spoke on ITV's This Morning to discuss her story and the huge uproar both posting them and their removal by Facebook has caused . In real life situations however, mothers often find themselves experiencing a far more negative reaction than their famous counterparts. A photograph of a mother breastfeeding her severely premature baby for the first time went viral earlier this week after it was removed from Facebook because it ‘breached nudity rules’. Emma Bond, 24, posted the picture of herself with Carene, who was born 12 weeks early, on Sunday. It was visible only to those she had approved as online friends. The mother of two was shocked when the site removed it the same day after an anonymous person – presumed to be one of her friends – reported it as offensive . Emma, like fellow mothers Alyssa Milano, Gwen Stefani, 45,  and supermodels Doutzen Kroes, 29, Miranda Kerr, 31, and Natalia Vodianova, 32, had posted the picture to social media as a form of celebration. Model Doutzen Kroes tweeted this picture of her nursing her son Phyllon Joy Gorré  with the caption ""Working mom;) feeding my precious baby between pictures..."" Former Victoria's Secret model Miranda Kerr tweeted this pic of herself breastfeeding son Flynn in 2011 . This black and white shot of Natalia Vodianova breastfeeding has received over 50,000 likes on Instagram . Singer Gwen Stefani is one of many celebrities who have expressed their support of all women nursing their babies wherever they may be . Speaking on ITV's This Morning Emma said: 'I was upset that somebody on my Facebook would (complain) but I didn't think Facebook would remove it. I contacted them and said that if they removed it I would take it as far as I could. I didn’t think I would end up sitting here. 'I posted the image into a breastfeeding support group saying what had happened. And I think everyone decided to share it and support it and it went viral. Last time I checked 250,000 had 'liked' the photo. 'If a baby’s hungry, they are hungry. It’s time to move with the times, Everyone I know has Facebook and people post photos of babies in bed with them sleeping. ‘Because breasts are sexualised I think there’s a confusion and that’s where the controversy comes from, people find it hard to separate the two.' So why the uprooar? And why do famous mothers seem to illicit such different reactions? Professor Rosalind Bramwell, a health psychologist specialising in reproductive health at the University of Chester says on the noticeable difference in peoples reactions to celebrities breast feeding: 'We have some very complex views on celebrities in society. 'it might be that we see these stars as women who show their bodies anyway, whose bodies are somehow already public so it matters less when they show their breast. 'A lot of the uproar women experience comes down to how much of the breast can be seen. It seems to matter an awful lot how much you can see the nipple. 'It goes to show how we understand the female body; to show the breast is seen as a sexualised act rather than an act of nourishing an infant.' Actress and model Jaime King breastfeeds her son James in this tender Instagram shot . Supermodel Gisele proved that mothers really can do it all when she shared this snap of herself breastfeeding baby Vivian while preparing for a shoot . Professor Louise Wallace of Coventry University told the MailOnline: 'There is wide range range in attitude to breast feeding in the UK. But in general it is not regarded as the norm. 'The norm seems to be to formula feed and there is lost of evidence of women experiencing stigma and negativity - either directly or indirectly - when they breastfeed in public. 'Even in front of other members of their own family inside their own home many mothers experience stigma over feeding. 'Studies suggest that 80 per cent of women give up breastfeeding before they want to and one of the strong reasons why that is that it is stigmatized and indeed sexualised. 'The breast is still viewed as a sexual organ in the this country rather than a means to give nutrition to infants.' Professor Wallace admits that there seems to be a difference in how the public in general views celebrities breastfeeding and their reaction to encountering it in real life. 'These are highly visible and respected people in the public eye and people look up to them. The positive response they get to breastfeeding is well know. 'It has previously been harnessed for public health campaigns to try and encourage others to keep breastfeeding, and people continue to try and use the effect for good.' In April last year an American mother criticised Facebook for taking down pictures of women breastfeeding their children from a support page she created for other mothers. Kristy Kemp, of Sacramento, California, was also barred from the page for days after the images were shared, even though Facebook said it did not ban nursing pictures, MailOnline reported. It follows a controversy on photo-sharing website Instagram in June which saw a mother’s account deactivated after she posted a pictured of her 19-month-old daughter showing off her belly button. The Daily Mail told how mother-of-four Courtney Adamo, 33, of north London, was sent an email by the Facebook-owned firm saying the image of Marlow ‘violated the community guidelines’. And in March, mother Emily Slough, spoke of her outrage after a stranger took a picture of her breastfeeding her daughter in public and uploaded it to Facebook, branding her a 'tramp'. MailOnline reported how Mrs Slough, from Rugeley, Staffordshire, was photographed when she stopped to feed her eight-month-old, Matilda, on the steps of a restaurant and have some lunch. Six years ago, the original decision by Facebook to ban mothers from posting 'inappropriate' photos of them breastfeeding their children caused protests by women's groups in the U.S.MailOnline reported how the campaign had picked up speed in 2008 when protesters organised a virtual 'nurse-in' on the site, as well as a demonstration outside Facebook's offices in California.","The case of Emma Bond has reignited the breast feeding in public debate .

"Good for you: Red wine has been proven to keep your cholesterol down . Yesterday’s blowout may have left you splayed on the sofa with a tum you fear will take January in the gym to work off. But despite its button-bursting reputation, your Christmas dinner could actually have done you no end of good. The meal takes some of our healthiest seasonally available foods and combines them with goodness-packed spices from the store cupboard. In fact, what you eat at this time of year is a classic celebration of the best nutrition available in Britain’s darkest months. Here, we reveal how Christmas foods will keep you hale and hearty long after the spinster aunts have gone home. So raise a glass to the knowledge that enjoying them all in sensible moderation — or in moderate moderation at least (it is the season of goodwill, after all) — will keep you going through the bleak midwinter. Turkey sharpens up your brain . Free-range turkeys are rich in protein . and contain amino acids that support cell repair, according to . nutritional studies. The dark meat is a good source of iron, and turkey . is low in fat, too, if you don’t eat the skin. Turkey . contains the amino acid tryptophan, which produces mood-boosting . serotonin and plays an important role in strengthening the immune . system. The chemical also makes us less impulsive and improves our . decision-making abilities. Sprouts protect you against cancer . Sprouts contain cancer-fighting chemicals that protect our DNA against damage and may be effective against breast and colon cancer. The International Journal of Urology found that the more sprouts men eat, the lower their risk of prostate cancer. They are an excellent source of immunity-boosting vitamin C and are high in vitamin A, which promotes supple skin. Sprouts are loaded with folic acid, important if you’re planning to become pregnant, and are high in fibre. They also protect against arthritis. Steam them to retain their anti-cancer chemicals; boiling diminishes them. Meal of the year: Despite how you may feel today, your big Christmas dinner may be the healthiest meal you have had all year . Cranberries save your heart and gums . Cranberries . are a source of antioxidants — substances that help neutralise free . radicals, which are the by-products of metabolism in the body that can . damage cell membranes and DNA. A laboratory study found that cranberries can help to protect against cancer and heart attacks. In . tests, people who drank two glasses of cranberry juice a day reduced . their levels of LDL (‘bad’) cholesterol. An experiment also discovered . that women who drank the juice suffered fewer urinary infections such as . cystitis. Cranberry juice was also seen to reduce dangerous strains of bacteria in the women’s bodies. Other studies have shown the juice to have anti-viral properties that may reduce the risk of gum disease and stomach ulcers. Potatoes put your tum in tip-top shape . Carrots are excellent, not least for their eyesight-boosting beta carotene. They also have cancer-fighting properties. And, if you have them with a splodge of mayonnaise, their nutritional powers are strengthened. Those humble-yet-tasty glazed parsnips also have anti-cancer properties — thanks to a group of chemicals called polyacetylenes that kill off leukaemia cells. Then there are mashed and roast potatoes, which are a source of B vitamins and carbohydrates to keep your gut healthy. Bloody good pud: The fruits and spices in your Christmas pudding help regulate the blood pressure and stabilises your blood sugar levels . Red wine controls your cholesterol . Every week there seems to be some new finding about the health-giving powers of red wine. Principally, . its antioxidant nutrients protect against heart disease. Moderate wine . drinkers have higher levels of HDL, the so-called ‘good cholesterol’, . says cardiologist Geoffrey Tofler. His . study of 3,000 people found that the blood platelets of people who . drank three to six standard measures a week are much less likely to . clump together in a way that could cause clotting. Christmas pud is good for your joints . All the fruit in Christmas pudding offers a potassium-rich energy boost that helps to regulate blood pressure. Meanwhile, . spices bring a healthy balance to the mix. Cinnamon stabilises . blood-sugar levels and softens the post-prandial crash big meals can . cause. Cinnamon may also . reduce inflammation in joints. Arthritis patients given half a teaspoon . of cinnamon powder with honey every morning suffered significantly less . pain after one week. Nutmeg . oil has been used to treat stress, pain, menstrual cramps and . indigestion. Studies have shown that nutmeg’s key component, isoeugenol, . has very powerful antibacterial properties — particularly against germs . in food. Cloves contain . eugenol and possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Studies have found this ingredient can kill cancer cells in melanoma, . leukaemia, and stomach tumours. They are also used in folk medicine to . treat nausea and toothache. On . top of all this, scientists have found that nutmeg, cinnamon and cloves . may all prompt our bodies to produce two groups of chemicals called . allylbenzenes and propenylbenzenes. These give us an amphetamine-like . energy buzz. Finish your vegetables: Sprouts may be effective against breast and colon cancer and also contains folic acid which boosts fertility . Clementines keep your skin healthy . Reach for the satsumas and clementines to fill up with fibre and get a rapid fix of vitamin C. Just one satsuma can provide nearly half your daily allowance of vitamin C, which is not only good for your digestive health, but also for nails, hair and complexion. Fruit fibre makes you feel fuller, quicker, so oranges can help you to stay within sight of your normal daily calorie consumption. Walnuts help cut  the risk of stroke . Nuts contain a kind of omega-3 fatty acid called alpha linolenic acid (ALA). This has benefits for body and brain, helping us to deal better with stress. A 2010 study showed the ALA in walnuts and walnut oil damp down the cardiovascular reactions that occur when we feel under pressure. Such heightened responses can put us at greater risk of heart attacks and strokes. Other research has found that walnuts have high levels of  antioxidants — more than any other type of nuts. These  antioxidants are also particularly effective, protecting our brains and helping circulation. Chocolates stop blood clots . Chocolates have proven to be another stress-reliever. Cardiologists have found that polyphenols in dark chocolate may help inhibit the formation of blood clots. So, come on . . . there’s still room for another choccie or two from granny’s selection box.",Sprouts protect against cancer and Christmas pudding helps stabilise your blood sugar .
"Tickets for last night’s sell-out London fireworks spectacular were being touted for £150 by a party organiser acquaintance of Prince Harry. The official tickets costing £10 were snapped up weeks ago, but Brazilian student Fellipe Trindade was offering some for 15 times their face value – claiming he had obtained them through British embassy contacts. The 22-year-old, who helped organise two official parties for Prince Harry, said his tickets were ‘special’ ones which permitted entry ‘as a guest of Mayor’ Boris Johnson. He boasted to a prospective buyer: ‘We are selling to make some money so I want to know how much you guys are willing to pay. Boast: Fellipe Trindade, pictured left, with Harry and another acquaintance. Trindade was offering tickets to the fireworks for 15 times their face value . ‘The Mayor of London had a few tickets that he gave to some embassies. As we work for the British consulate [in Sao Paulo] we made some arrangements and they gave us tickets.’ The New Year fireworks display, which lights up the Thames, has become massively popular, attracting a crowd of half a million people last year. This year, it was made ticket-only because of concerns about public safety, but critics warned that touts would try to take advantage. To combat touting, Mr Johnson ordered that all tickets should have the name of the purchaser printed on them, which would be checked against the holder’s ID before they were allowed entry. Mr Trindade, who was offering the tickets on Facebook, said that ‘the best thing of my ticket is they don’t have name as a guest of mayor [sic]’, adding: ‘It is a special ticket I got for working at the British Embassy.’ He met Harry in Sao Paulo in March 2012 when he was on the organising committee for a polo dinner held in aid of the Prince’s Sentebale charity. Then last summer, during the football World Cup in Brazil, he was a guest at a party to celebrate the Queen’s birthday hosted by the British ambassador and attended by Prince Harry. Mr Trindade initially claimed he had obtained his fireworks tickets through his connections with the British Embassy in the capital, Brasilia. But he later said he was selling them for a friend who had ‘won them in a radio competition’. He promised buyers he would be able to register their names on the tickets. Last night, he said he had simply given them away in the end. Around 100,000 people watched the fireworks on the banks of the River Thames . London welcomed 2015 with a spectacular firework show . The Mayor’s office denied that special tickets had been given to British embassies, and the Foreign Office said it was not aware of any. A spokesman for the Mayor said: ‘What he is suggesting is impossible as all the tickets were printed with the purchaser’s name on them and posted to people. They also contain holographic stamps which cannot be printed out. ‘Touting isn’t illegal, but we’ve gone to great lengths to prevent touting and second selling, and have been encouraging people not to buy tickets from unofficial sites. ‘This looks like a scam and it’s simply wrong to suggest the Mayor gave away a small number of tickets. He had no tickets to give away. ‘This man’s claims are completely false and we do not believe he possesses genuine tickets to the event.’ Official tickets for last night’s fireworks sold out by December 16, and were being unofficially re-sold for up to £247 on ticket websites. Previously, the event was free but its popularity put too much of a strain on transport and safety, organisers said. Last night barriers were used to form three official viewing areas for the fireworks – on Westminster Bridge, on the north embankment of the Thames between Westminster and Waterloo bridges and on the Southbank behind the London Eye – with stewards controlling entry by checking tickets and ID. Hundreds of revellers complained on Twitter about the fee, with one writing: ‘£10 just to look at the sky? No thanks.’ A spokesman for Prince Harry declined to comment.","Official tickets for the sell-out London fireworks spectacular cost £10 .

"David Cameron’s vow that Britain and its allies would not allow Islamic State to form caliphate on Europe’s doorstep had a hollow ring for the besieged people of Kobani yesterday. Huge plumes of smoke billowed over the pivotal border town as jihadi fanatics – some claiming to be British – launched a terrifying onslaught. Kobani, which lies just inside Syria on the border with Nato member Turkey, has been described as the town the world cannot afford to lose to the terrorists. Scroll down for video . Gran's army: Women line up with Kalashnikov assault rifles in the besieged border town of Kobani, Syria . If they succeed in taking it, IS will control an unbroken 125-mile stretch of frontier with our Turkish allies. Kobani is barely more than 200 yards from Turkey, which wants to join the EU, and for the past two weeks it has been possible to stand on a Turkish hillside and watch as the jihadis under their black flag tighten their stranglehold on the Syrian town. A massacre beckons, and nobody seems capable of stopping it. Inside Kobani, populated by Syrian Kurds, fires rage as artillery shells thump into densely-packed neighbourhoods. At least 25 mortar rounds rained down yesterday on a hopelessly outnumbered army of resistance, a Dad’s Army style force that has come to be symbolised by a band of gun-toting grandmothers. A picture of the women, brandishing Kalashnikov assault rifles, was retweeted around the world yesterday by those anxious to raise awareness of the plight of the people of Kobani. Outgunned, they respond only with occasional rocket-propelled grenades and bursts of rifle fire. They have also converted tractors and other farm equipment into armoured vehicles fitted with aging Soviet-era guns. Closing in fast: Smoke rises as the Islamic State militants attack Kobani, under the noses of forces in Turkey . At least 25 mortar rounds rained down yesterday on a hopelessly outnumbered army of resistance. Above, strikes hit the residential area in Kobani . Stopping towns like this falling was the reason the US launched a campaign of airstrikes – backed by the RAF in Iraq. But they have failed to stem IS’s brutal advance and a bloodbath seems horribly likely. Seven men and three women from Kobani have already been beheaded by the jihadis, with the women’s heads placed on macabre display in Jarabulus, a nearby IS stronghold. A gruesome photograph uploaded to Twitter purported to show a grinning IS fighter clutching the decapitated head of a girl. And there are sickening reports of women and girls being raped. Over the weekend, a British jihadi taunted the people of Kobani by posting another photo showing his terror gang was within sight of their homes. The siege has forced some 160,000 people to flee across the frontier. Some sit weeping on hilltops on the Turkey side of the border, watching helplessly while their homes go up in smoke. Fleeing families have told of unspeakable horrors. One young father, Mostafa Kader, who fled ten days ago, revealed how the body of his sister in law and eight-year-old niece were found in pools of blood. ‘They had been raped and their hearts were cut out,’ he said. ‘I buried them with my own hands.’ Islamic State is using captured US-made tanks and other military hardware which had been left in the hands of the Iraqi army, whole regiments of which have simply fled from IS. The RAF cannot intervene because it has no mandate to bomb in Syria, despite British Tornados flying right overhead to conduct bombing raids in neighbouring Iraq. American warplanes have been bombing around Kobani, and yesterday at least 16 IS militants were declared dead from airstrikes and ground attacks. But it is not enough. Kurdish refugees wait by the side of the road near Suruc, Turkey, after their arrival from Kobani. The siege has forced some 160,000 people to flee across the frontier . The Turks have promised to ‘do whatever we can’ – a stray mortar even landed a mile inside Turkey yesterday, wounding five people in a house near the town of Suruc. Convoys of lorries carrying Turkish tanks have been driven south to the border. However there was no sign of them arriving yesterday. On social media, tech-savvy IS has been crowing that no one can stop it fulfilling its dream of carving out a medieval caliphate, in which anyone not adhering to its arbitrary strictures is beheaded or crucified, or has limbs chopped off. Yesterday it was reported that some British jihadists have found it too much. Up to 100 have defected and are stranded in Turkey because they fear imprisonment if they return to the UK. Yet an estimated dozen or so would-be holy warriors from Britain are still joining the warped cause every month. Mr Cameron warned last month of the ‘poisonous’ threat of jihadis returning to the UK, and said the world had to deal with IS. A woman waits by the side of the road near the Turkish border after fleeing from Kobani. One man carries lightweight mattresses from his besieged home . He said: ‘If it succeeds, we would be facing a terrorist state on the shores of the Mediterranean and bordering a Nato member.’ But the ease with which British and other fanatics slip between Turkey and Syria, under the noses of border guards, makes a mockery of claims Turkey is cracking down on its label as a ‘gateway to jihad’. Mohtar Topdemir, a hotel owner in the frontier town of Akcakale, said: ‘We never see the recruits – they cross at night and are smuggled illegally under a fence – but we see their bags, which the smugglers transport separately. Every two or three days, about 50 or 60 Western rucksacks come through the official border crossing, and we can see their luggage tags – British Airways, Air France, Turkish Airlines. ‘The smugglers arrange for their rucksacks to follow them. A Turkish porter can carry them through the Turkish border gate and leave them in “no-mans-land” and then a Syrian porter can come from the other side and pick them up. It means the jihadists are reunited with all their belongings.’ There are dozens of border towns strung along the 560-mile frontier where potential recruits can simply melt away until it is time to cross into Syria. Stopping towns like Kobani, pictured under siege yesterday, falling was the reason the US launched a campaign of airstrikes – backed by the RAF in Iraq . Mohammed Aldeen, 21, a Syrian who had just crossed illegally from Syria into Turkey, said: ‘If anything, it was easier than previous times. ‘It is very well arranged now, in both directions. I got into a van with no windows with about 20 people, men and women. ‘We drove to a place on the border and then waited for a few hours. The smugglers are constantly on their phones, checking with their people on both sides. ‘Then they give the signal that it is clear, and the doors open and we all run. This time, there was a fence and a one-metre tunnel dug under it, which we all crawled through. ‘No one asks any questions.’ In the next few days, if Kobani falls, Downing Street and the White House will face plenty of questions about whether their strategy to deal with Islamic State is working. For the people of Kobani, it will be too late.","Jihadi fanatics launched terrifying onslaught on Kobani, Syria .

"Evidence that a colony of previously unknown flying reptiles  lived around a desert lake around 100 million years ago, has been uncovered by scientists. Fossil remains of at least 47 pterosaurs with wingspans ranging from two to eight feet (65 to 235cm), were discovered at Cruzeiro do Oeste in southern Brazil. But the huge number of bones could indicate that hundreds of young and adult individuals perished there. Fossil remains of at least 47 pterosaurs with wingspans ranging from two to eight feet (65 to 235cm), were discovered at Cruzeiro do Oeste. Caiuajara dobruskii had a large bony crest on the top of its head that changed from being small when it was young, to large and steep in adults (pictured) It is the first time scientists have located a pterosaur 'bone bed' containing fossils from many individuals of the same species. The site where they were found covers an area of less than 215 square feet (20 square metres). The pterosaur Caiuajara dobruskii had a large bony crest on the top of its head that changed from being small when it was young, to large and steep in adults. It is thought to have been a gregarious species that learned to fly at a very young age. Dr Alexander Kellner, from Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, said: 'Based on the available information, we conclude that Caiuajara dobruskii lived in colonies around an inland lake situated in a desert. It is the first time scientists have located a pterosaur 'bone bed' containing fossils from many individuals of the same species.They found the site at Cruzeiro do Oeste (marked on the map) in Brazil . Caiuajara dobruskii is a type of previously-unknown pterosaur - ancient flying reptiles. Its wingspan ranged from two to eight ft (56 to 235cm). Caiuajara dobruskii had a large bony crest on the top of its head that changed from being small when it was young, to large and steep in adults. It is thought to have been a gregarious species that learned to fly at a very young age. Experts think the creature lived in colonies - in this case, around a lake in the desert. Writing in the journal Public Library of Science ONE, he continued: 'The presence of three main levels of accumulation in a section of less than one metre suggests that this region was home to pterosaur populations for an extended period of time. ‘It is also plausible that Caiuajara was a migratory pterosaur that visited this area from time to time, although the first possibility is favoured here. 'The causes of death remain unknown, although similarities with dinosaur drought-related mortality are striking. 'However, it is also possible that desert storms could have been responsible for the occasional demise of these pterosaurs.' The fossil record of pterosaurs, which lived alongside the dinosaurs but were unrelated to birds, is patchy. Their bones were fragile and few of the creatures lived in places where fossils form easily, making pterosaur finds rare. Most have consisted of incomplete skeletons of a single individual.","Fossil remains of at least 47 pterosaurs with wingspans ranging from two to eight feet (65 to 235cm), were discovered at Cruzeiro do Oeste, Brazil .

"Taking aspirin for 10 years could more than double the risk of sight loss, according to a new study. Scientists say taking aspirin could increase the chance of developing wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) - an eye disorder that can lead to blindness. A team from the University of Wisconsin used data from the Beaver Dam Eye Study on age-related eye diseases. Scroll down for video . Risk: Scientists say aspirin could contribute to the development of an eye disorder that may lead to blindness . Failing eyesight: Age-related macular degeneration affects a quarter of over-60s in the UK and more than half of over-75s . Eye exams were performed every five years over a 20-year period on nearly 5,000 participants. The volunteers, aged 43 to 86, were then asked if they had regularly used aspirin at least twice a week for more than three months. The average duration of follow-up was 14.8 years. For the study, the researchers measured the incidences of different types of AMD. Wet AMD makes up just 10 per cent of cases but causes severe vision loss, while dry AMD is more common and milder - although it can develop into wet AMD at any time. Results showed there were 512 cases of dry AMD and 117 cases of wet AMD over the course of the study for journal JAMA. An eye affected by wet AMD. It causes rapid central vision loss, which cannot be restored . Treatment: AMD can be treated with radiation beam that burn abnormal blood vessels behind the retina of eyes . The researchers found those who took aspirin for 10 years had a 1.4 per cent risk of developing wet AMD compared to just 0.6 per cent of non-users. There was no association found between taking aspirin and developing dry AMD. Dr Barbara Klein said: 'Aspirin use in the United States is widespread, with an estimated 19.3 percent of adults reporting regular consumption, and reported use increases with age. 'The results of cross-sectional studies of aspirin use and its relation to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) have been inconsistent. Dr Barbara Klein said there was a small but statistically signficiant association between aspirin use and wet AMD . 'AMD is a potentially blinding condition for which prevalence and incidence are increasing with the increased survival of the population, and regular use of aspirin is common and becoming more widespread in persons in the age range at highest risk for this disease. 'Therefore, it is imperative to further examine this potential association. 'Our findings are consistent with a small but statistically significant association between regular aspirin use and incidence of neovascular AMD (wet AMD).' The most common cause of blindness in the elderly, age-related macular degeneration affects a quarter of over-60s in the UK and more than half of over-75s. The team said further research would be needed to confirm the findings. If true it could help develop ways to prevent wet AMD. Aspirin is often referred to as a wonder drug. Besides acting as a painkiller aspirin acts as an anti-inflammatory . agent. The pill thins the blood and a low daily dose of 75mg has been found to reduce the risk of clots forming in the blood. Research . suggests the benefits of taking a daily aspirin outweigh the small risk . of side-effects in patients with heart disease, although a doctor . should always be consulted. A . series of studies involving 200,000 patients found the pill also cut . the risk of dying of cancer by 37 per cent if taken for five years.

"She's the size 12 model who has become a byword for feminine curves but Robyn Lawley says she's sick of being classed as 'plus size'. In an interview with Clique magazine, the 24-year-old Australian spoke of her bemusement that despite being the owner of a toned, healthy body, the fashion industry persists in considering her - and others like her - larger than normal. 'People think plus-size models don't exercise - we do!' she said. 'But it's about health, not forcing my body to be something it's not meant to be.' Scroll down for video . Beautiful: 'Plus-size' model Robyn Lawley has spoken out about the lack of 'size diversity' in fashion . 6ft 2"" Lawley, who has appeared in campaigns for Ralph Lauren and has numerous Vogue covers under her belt, admits she once tried to slim down to satisfy the demands of mainstream modelling, but added that even though she was starving herself, achieving size zero proved impossible. 'Even at my lightest, I just couldn't get there,' she explains. 'I genuinely really tried. I was counting calories, I was taking diet pills, I was dabbling in starvation.' She adds: 'I thought you had to be skinny to be beautiful. And I thought I would never be beautiful at this size.' Since giving calorie-counting the boot, Lawley has shot to fame and has followed in the stiletto-clad footsteps of fellow high-profile plus-size models, Crystal Renn and Sophie Dahl - both of whom are as much admired for their curves as they are for their beauty. In proportion: Lawley shows off her toned size 12 figure in a campaign for lingerie brand Boux Avenue . Plus-size? Sophie Dahl (left) and Crystal Renn (right) are both categorised as larger models . Nevertheless, the question of using plus-size models remains fraught in an industry where the average girl is between 5ft 8"" and 6ft tall, and wears dress size six. By contrast, the average plus-size model, although of a similar height to other girls, is a dress size 12 or 14. Although recently signed by Mango to front their new plus-size range Violetta - which starts at a size 12 - Lawley, who boasts perfect proportions, is irritated that the industry continues to see her and others like her as a niche part of the business. She also questions why models who fall in the 'no-man's land' between straight size and plus-size continue to be left out, despite having healthy size 10 bodies. 'People say, ""How is she a plus-size model?"" and I'm like, ""Exactly, this is the point, how am I a plus-size model?"" Glamorous: Plus size model Signe Nordstrom starred in a campaign for 50 Shades of Grey lingerie by KappAhl . Healthy: Lawley shows off her curves on the beach in Australia (left) and on the cover of Clique magazine (right) Stunning: Recently, Robyn Lawley appeared in a Chantelle lingerie campaign aimed at women of all sizes . 'Fashion designers won't go past a size two [UK size six], so there's no size diversity - just none. 'So there's a whole no-man's land of models who are in between the 'straight size' and the 'plus-size' and they are not working, yet they've got these amazing bodies that are completely in proportion.' She also revealed that she would like to see the end of the term 'plus-size' altogether, arguing that as she isn't a plus-size person, she shouldn't be considered one. 'I don't think anyone should be called plus-size,' she adds. 'I think it's derogatory to anyone - it's a label. 'I'm a model; I don't think I need 'plus-size' in front of it.'

"If you're bored of blueberries and have had enough of splashing the cash on goji berries, the pitaya could be the super fruit for you. But the fruit isn't your average healthy treat. While it might look innocuous, the pitaya is harvested from a South American cactus - and has the spines to prove it. But when you are able to get inside - it's worth the trouble. The fruit has been hailed as having remarkable health-giving properties, including the ability to regulate blood sugar levels in diabetes as well as providing a dose of anti-oxidants. Super fruit: The South American pitaya or dragon fruit  is part of the cactus family . Although the fruit originates in South America, it is now grown in Thailand, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and the Philippines, where it's loved for its many health benefits. Said to be rich in vitamin C, fibre and calcium, the pitaya - or dragon fruit as it's also known - gives you a bigger bang for your buck than similar super fruits such as acai berries. Already available in Waitrose and Tesco, the bright pink fruit is full of edible black seeds and boasts flesh that tastes like a cross between a kiwi fruit and a pear. Along with a mega-dose of vitamin C, pitaya is also thought to help lower cholesterol and is packed with skin-boosting antioxidants. So 2012: Other super fruits such as acai berries (left) and pomegranates (right) are falling out of favour . The tiny black seeds are a great source of healthy Omega-3 fat and there's plenty of magnesium and calcium in the flesh. Pitaya is even believed to help help regulate blood sugar levels - in Taiwan, diabetes sufferers are urged to eat them by doctors. Although the Taiwanese medical profession is convinced, as yet, the health benefits of pitaya haven't been confirmed by any European studies. Nevertheless, with their beautiful rosy-pink colour and dramatic green fronds, they will at least look fabulous in your fruit bowl. .","Dragon fruit, also known as Pitaya or pitahaya, is prescribed to patients in Taiwan to regulate blood sugar levels .

"What man-made instrument spans 30,000 miles (50,000km), undergoes shifts in time and could be used to detect dark matter? No, it's not a new super-collider, but instead the world's GPS satellites that provide us with sat-nav that could be used as a giant cosmic detector, scientists have claimed. Using satellites orbiting around our planet, it may be possible to detect tiny fluctuations that hint at the whereabouts of the universe's elusive dark matter. Scientists in the US and Canada say Earth's GPS system (satellite illustrated) could detect dark matter. They are poring through 15 years of data to look for small fluctuations in the space-time fabric. It's thought dark matter may cause noticeable 'time discrepancies' The innovative method was proposed by Dr Andrei Derevianko, of the University of Nevada, Reno, and his colleague Dr Maxim Pospelov, of the University of Victoria and the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Canada. The two are starting to test their dark matter detection ideas by analysing clock data from the 30 GPS satellites over the past 15 years, which use atomic clocks for everyday navigation. Dark matter surrounds galaxies across the universe, and is invisible because it does not reflect light. It cannot be seen directly with telescopes, but astronomers know it to be out there because of the gravitational effects it has on the matter we can see. The European Space Agency says: 'Shine a torch in a completely dark room, and you will see only what the torch illuminates. 'That does not mean that the room around you does not exist. 'Similarly we know dark matter exists but have never observed it directly.' Scientists are fairly sure it exists and is crucial to the universe, but they do not know what it looks like or where to find it. Networks of atomic clocks can apparently be used to search for defects expected to occur as a result of dark matter. It is thought there will be time discrepancies between clocks separated at great distances. Scientists are fairly certain that dark matter is persistent in the galaxy, evidenced partially by its ability to bend light around galaxies. And it may too have a similar effect on a detector that's big enough to pick up such fluctuations - in this case the myriad satellites currently orbiting Earth. 'If the dark matter were not there, the normal matter that we know about would not be sufficient to bend the light as much as it does,' said Dr Geoff Blewitt, director of the Nevada Geodetic Laboratory, who is collaborating on the project. 'One possibility is that the dark matter in this gas might not be made out of particles like normal matter, but of macroscopic imperfections in the fabric of space-time. Using the satellites as a giant detector may by sensitive enough to find evidence of dark matter. They are looking for a discrepancy of just a billionth of a second. But this would be enough to prove that dark matter exists in the universe (illustrated) This two-clocks-illustration shows the pattern of how two atomic clocks would desynchronise and then resynchronise due to a lump of dark matter sweeping through a Global Positioning System (GPS) or other atomic clock based network . 'Earth sweeps through this gas as it orbits the galaxy. So to us, the gas would appear to be like a galactic wind of dark matter blowing through the Earth system and its satellites. 'As the dark matter blows by, it would occasionally cause clocks of the GPS system to go out of sync with a tell-tale pattern over a period of about three minutes. 'If the dark matter causes the clocks to go out of sync by more than a billionth of a second we should easily be able to detect such events.' It remains to be seen whether this 'cosmic kink' idea is correct, namely that dark matter is not uniform and constant. Rather, the scientists say it is a gas-like collection of topological defects, or 'energy cracks'. 'The idea is, where the [GPS] clocks go out of synchronization, we would know that dark matter, the topological defect, has passed by,' said Dr Derevianko. 'In fact, we envision using the GPS constellation as the largest human-built dark-matter detector.' If it works, it could finally reveal the missing aspect of more than 95 per cent of the universe. There is evidence that dark energy accounts for about 68 percent of the universe's mystery mass and energy. The remaining 27 percent is generally acknowledged to be dark matter, even though it is not visible and eludes direct detection and measurement. The research was published in the journal Nature Physics. Quantum physicist Dr Andrei Derevianko, pictured, of the University of Nevada has contributed to the development of several novel classes of atomic clocks and now is proposing using networks of synchronised atomic clocks to detect dark matter. His paper on the topic is published in the journal Nature Physics .

"A Mediterranean diet does little for the brain and won’t prevent dementia, researchers claim. French scientists say there is no evidence that eating plenty of fruit, vegetables and oily fish boosts concentration in old age. Inspired by traditional eating habits in Italy, Spain and Greece, the diet has been shown to prevent heart disease and cancer as well as increase life expectancy. French researchers say there is no evidence that a Mediterranean diet boosts memory or concentration in old age . And recently a number of studies have implied it may be just as beneficial for the brain and could stave off Alzheimer’s. Some scientists believe that because . the diet is low in saturated fat, it prevents the blood vessels that . supply the brain becoming blocked. But academics from Paris Sorbonne University say there is no evidence for such a link. The researchers tracked the diets of . 3,000 middle-aged adults for more than a decade and divided them into . three groups depending on how ‘Mediterranean’ their diet was. When the . adults were 65 and over, they took six tests which checked their . concentration and memory. It has been suggested that the 'good' fats from foods such as oily fish might benefit the brain directly . The results, published in the American . Journal of Clinical Nutrition, found no difference between the scores . of the three groups. Lead researcher Emmanuelle Kesse-Guyot . said: ‘Midlife adherence to a MedDiet was not associated with global . cognitive performance [brain power assessed 13 years later].’ Furthermore the researchers said that recent work by other  scientists had also failed to find any link. Last year, the Foundation for Public . Health in Paris found  women over 65 who followed a Mediterranean diet . did not perform any better in memory tests. However, Professor Nikos Scarmeas, . from the Columbia University Medical Centre in New  York, said there was . not yet enough evidence to draw firm conclusions about the diet’s . effect on the brain.","No evidence that eating plenty of fruit, veg and oily fish boosts concentration in old age, say French experts .

"Homeopathy was condemned as ‘rubbish’ by Britain’s chief medical officer yesterday, who admitted she is ‘perpetually surprised’ it is available on the NHS. Professor Dame Sally Davies also described homeopaths as ‘peddlers’ and spoke of her concern that they can prescribe pills and potions to treat malaria and other illnesses. Giving evidence to an influential committee of MPs, Dame Sally said that homeopathy doesn’t work past the placebo effect. Civil servants watered down an article on the NHS Choices website that had warned there was no evidence that homeopathic remedies work . In other words, any benefits patients . perceive are simply caused by them receiving attention and simply . expecting to feel better. Her outspoken views are in conflict . with the policy of the Health Service, which spends around £4million a . year on funding homeopathic hospitals and on prescriptions and . referrals. Homeopathy, which has the backing of . Prince Charles, claims to prevent and treat diseases using diluted forms . of plants, herbs and minerals. It is based on the principle that an illness can be treated by substances that produce similar symptoms. Outspoken medic Professor Dame Sally Davies, left, has described homeopathy as 'rubbish' despite the fact it has been endorsed by high profile figures such as Prince Charles, right . For example, it is claimed onions, which make eyes itchy and tearful, can be used to relieve the symptoms of hay fever. Other treatments include anti-malaria . tablets made from African swamp water, rotting plants and mosquito eggs . and larvae. But scientists argue the ‘cures’ are so diluted they are . unlikely to contain any of the original substance. Asked about her views on homeopathy . by the Commons science and technology committee, Dame Sally – a . consultant haematologist, or specialist in blood diseases, at the . Central Middlesex Hospital from 1985 until 2011 – said: ‘I’m very . concerned when homeopathic practitioners try to peddle this way of life . to prevent malaria or other infectious diseases.’ She added: ‘I am perpetually . surprised that homeopathy is available on the NHS.’ Dame Sally concluded . by saying homeopathy ‘is rubbish’. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has . endorsed homeopathy. In 2007, while shadow minister for the disabled, he signed an early day motion backing its use on the NHS. Fifteen per cent of Britons have used homeopathy at some point in their lives. The exact amount of NHS spending on . the discipline is unclear but various homeopathic associations say it is . as high as £4million a year. The Department of Health said it is up to local NHS organisations to decide whether to fund it.","NHS spends £4m a year on homeopathy treatments .

"Money cannot buy love - but it seems many feel it can buy a friendship. A study found UK adults have spent on average £158 on gifts for their closest friend in the last year. The survey by the Post Office found half of Britons worry about the cost of their friendships. Brits spend an average of £158 on gifts for their closest friend throughout the year, a study has found . It is perhaps understandable when the cost of buying Christmas and birthday gifts for a best friend over a lifetime adds up to £6,800. It showed a sixth of adults use their overdraft to buy a friend a present, while a quarter have lied about being busy to avoid the expense of celebrating with friends. Meanwhile, half have had concerns about the impact buying a friend’s present will have on their finances. On average, we spend £62 on Christmas presents and £47 on birthday gifts for our closest friend. One in seven people spend more than £100 on their friend’s Christmas present. When a best friend has children, the costs become even higher – with us spending an additional £53 annually on gifts for our best friend’s brood. The cost of friendship: Adults spend £62 on Christmas presents and £47 for birthday gifts for their best friend . The vast majority of adults said they did not save up in advance to cover the costs. John Willcock, head of current cccounts at Post Office said: ‘The cost of being a good friend can really add up, but most of us think it is worth it. ‘However no friend would want you to get into debt on their behalf and sometimes we need to honest when our budgets are tight.’ A friend’s impending nuptials can also be expensive with the average Briton splashing £62 on an engagement party and present and £70 on a stag or hen do.","Brits spend an average of £158 on gifts for their friends throughout a year .

"To those who say that playing video games is a waste of time, a man from South Korea has proved otherwise. Dong-hwan 'Violet' Kim has earned nearly $100,000 playing games and now he also has a visa that will allow him to live in America as well. Kim has become the first professional StarCraft 2 player to receive a P-1A internationally recognized athlete visa. The U.S. professional athlete visa is the same kind that many swimmers and gymnasts use to live in in the United States while perfecting their sport. In the zone: This man is a professional.  23 year old Dong-hwan 'Violet' Kim received a P-1A visa in order to move to the US, to train, compete, and even make a living there for the next five years playing computer games . Athlete: South Korean Gamer Kim Dong Hwan, who is a professional gamer is the first StarCraft player to be granted a traditional pro athlete visa in the United States . The news is said to have brought Kim to tears, and is the second ever instance of gamers being recognized as athletes by the US. The visa is for those 'coming to the U.S. temporarily to perform at a specific athletic competition as an athlete, individually or as part of a group or team, at an internationally recognized level of performance,' according to the U.S. government. It will allow Kim to travel and earn money in the US for the next five years according to The Daily Dot. Nice little earner: Violet, as Kim is known, as earned nearly $100,000 by playing video games . StarCraft is a military science fiction real-time strategy video game. Set in a fictitious timeline during the Earth's 25th century, the game revolves around three species fighting for dominance in a distant part of the Milky Way galaxy. Many of the gaming industry's journalists have praised StarCraft as one of the best and most important video games of all time, and for having raised the bar for developing real-time strategy games. The game has been praised for pioneering the use of unique factions in real-time strategy gameplay and for a compelling story . Kim was ecstatic. '’I’ve been so jealous when others Koreans traveled to the USA for tournaments. I have been trying to go to USA as well, but I got denied 3 times, and I was almost ready to give up … really almost, it was lots [of] drama … but my manager found out another last way, and we worked hard together. If we got denied this last time too, yea, I would pretty much have to retire .. no more esports,' he said. 'Seven months of work, and 500 pages later, it has paid off, and I couldn't be more thrilled for Dong-Hwan,' said Andrew Tomlinson, founder of Cyber Solutions Agency (CSA), which represents Kim. 'I want to especially thank all those who helped in this long process with us, without your valuable support I am not sure if Violet would still be in eSports.' The idea: StarCraft pits humans and two alien species against each other in a real-time strategy game that requires players to keep track of military operations, resources, and manufacturing . Gaming craft: This is only the second time an eSports competitor has gotten an athletic visa, and now, the government may view them on the same level . Earlier this year, the United States elected to allow professional gamers the right to apply for the same visa that a traditionally-recognized athlete would apply for. The first gamer ever to receive this type of visa was Danny Le, a League of Legends player who was granted a visa earlier this year . Now Kim has also made history, being the first StarCraft player to be awarded the same honor. E-Sports, or electronic sports, refers to competitive video game competitions among professional players. StarCraft 2 is one of the most popular eSports platforms. Some sporting athletes may not put gamers in the same league as them, let alone immigration level as professional athletes, but there's no questioning Kim's passion. While playing Warcraft 3 at home in 2009, he was unaware that his house was on fire until the electricity went out. 'As a young Orc prospect, he had won several games that night when the power went out and he finally opened the door to see the disaster that was consuming his home,' the Daily Dot said. Kim was hospitalized for smoke inhalation but later recovered. He is expected to arrive in the US this month. Access granted: Kim was facing early retirement if he wasn't granted US-entry. Over the course of seven months, he and his manager penned a 500-page application to immigration services . The idea: StarCraft is a military science fiction real-time strategy video game.

"Despite a painful knee injury - and a broken heart - Rory McIlroy gave the thumbs up to life after another brilliant round saw him take the lead at the Memorial Tournament less than a week after winning at Wentworth. The Northern Irishman shot a superb nine-under-par round of 63 at Muirfield Village, despite battling through an injury scare concerning his left knee. McIlroy eased fears over the injury by posing after his round for an Instagram picture, which showed his knee receiving special ice treatment to ensure he can play on in the tournament. Still smiling: Rory McIlroy revealed he was receiving ice treatment on his knee in Ohio on Thursday by sharing this Instagram picture. The Northern Irishman looked happy with life after his brilliant round at Muirfield Village . The 25-year-old world No 6 was smiling, giving the camera a thumbs-up and looking content with his day's work. 'After a nice opening 63, icing my knee, getting game ready for tomorrow!' he said in a positive message posted alongside the picture. McIlroy, a two-time major champion, was using a Game Ready System to treat his injury. The machine was developed by scientists and doctors using NASA space suit technology and circulates cold water from an ice reservoir through  a wrap, which is applied to the injured area of the body and provides compression as well as ice treatment.

Ouch: McIlroy hurt his left knee during a swing on the seventh hole of his first round . It has been a difficult couple of weeks off the course for McIlroy after he called off his engagement to Danish tennis star Wozniacki, just days after the couple had sent out wedding invitations. But on the course he has flourished since the break-up, winning the European Tour's flagship event, the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth, on Sunday before his awesome display in Ohio on Thursday. McIlroy picked up seven birdies and two eagles to storm to the top of the leaderboard on the first day of Jack Nicklaus's tournament. England's Paul Casey shot a six-under 66 earlier to take a share of second place with Masters champion Bubba Watson and Chris Kirk. That winning feeling: McIlroy won the European Tour's flagship event at Wentworth last week . Break-up: McIlroy ended his engagement to tennis star Caroline Wozniacki (right) last week . McIlroy was troubled by a sore left knee from his seventh hole of the day. Asked what was wrong, McIlroy replied: 'Honestly I don't know. I felt it on my second shot on (hole) seven. I think my foot might have just got stuck in the ground a little bit and torqued my knee. 'It was painful right after I hit shots and then I sort of walked it off for the next one and it was okay, and then it would be painful again. I guess I put it out of my mind when I was over the golf shots. 'I'm going to go and get some treatment on it now and have a physio look at it. Hopefully it will be all right for tomorrow.

"A mother was forced to spend £90 taking her sick son to a hospital in a taxi in a desperate bid to find out what was wrong with him. Rebbeca George, 27, was convinced her son Jake was seriously ill - but doctors at her local hospital repeatedly insisted he was fine. In despair, after eights visits over six months, she got in a taxi and travelled more than 100 miles from her home in the Lake District, the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital. Within two days of arriving, five-year-old Jake was diagnosed with advanced cancer and found to be 'riddled' with tumours. Rebbeca George, 27, was forced to take her desperately ill five-year-old son Jake, more than 100 miles in a £90 taxi ride to an emergency unit in Manchester, after doctors at her local hospital said he was fine . Within two days of arriving in Manchester, Jake was diagnosed with advanced cancer and was found to be 'riddled' with tumours . He endured five rounds of gruelling chemotherapy and will still need one more, but scans have now revealed his cancer has gone. Miss George took Jake – who has severe autism and learning disabilities – to the scandal-hit Furness General Hospital (FGH), Cumbria, for the first time in May, when he was sent away with a suspected viral infection. FGH is currently the subject of a public inquiry, following fears over the deaths of at least eight mothers and babies in 2008. But even after the pair had been sent home from the hospital, Miss George was still convinced there was something wrong with Jake. She returned again and he was diagnosed with an infection and a lack of iron in his blood, but was then discharged with antibiotics and iron supplements. However she remained worried and returned to FGH  six times over six months, only to be told her son was 'getting better'. Miss George said: 'At the beginning of this year, I started noticing little things, like every now and then he'd start limping for no reason. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is an uncommon cancer that develops in the lymphatic system, which is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout your body. The lymphatic system is part of the immune system. Clear fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells known as lymphocytes. In non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the affected lymphocytes start to multiply in an abnormal way and begin to collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes (glands). The affected lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties, making you more vulnerable to infection. The most common symptom of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit or groin. Source: NHS Choices . 'I'd taken him to the hospital for that before, but they'd never come back with anything. 'Then around March time it seemed he was always tired, he'd scream all night long, and he wouldn't sleep. 'He'd be running around playing and then he'd suddenly be crying and there was nothing you could do to calm him down or make him feel better. 'He just went from being really happy and hyper to being really quiet and miserable. 'He was sleeping all the time and he just lay there really sad. He wouldn't do anything.' The last time he was sent away from hospital, Jake spent the night severely unwell and collapsed the following morning. Miss George felt she had no option but to take him from their Lake District home to a dedicated unit at the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, more than 100 miles away. Within 48 hours of arriving in Manchester, Jake was given morphine and a blood transfusion, having been diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. An MRI scan at the beginning of June revealed tumours all over his spine and in his spleen, liver and kidneys. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a rare cancer that develops in the lymphatic system, which is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout the body. It occurs when white blood cells called lymphocytes - that help the body fight infection and disease - begin growing in an uncontrolled way. Jake underwent five gruelling round of chemotherapy, and has one more to go. Miss George is now keeping people up to date on her son's progress via Jake's Journey Facebook page . Jake was also diagnosed with a specific type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma known as Burkitt lymphoma, which affects specific white blood cells known as 'B-cells', which mature in the bone marrow. Miss George described the shock at finding out her son had advanced cancer. She said: 'He was riddled with tumours. 'Even having suspected he might have cancer, the sheer amount of them I couldn't have been prepared for.' Jake's treatment at Royal Manchester Children's Hospital saw him endure five gruelling runs of chemotherapy. Sessions usually lasted four to five days, followed by him being put on a drip to flush the toxicity of the drugs out of his system. 'Because his cancer was fast growing and very aggressive they had to treat it the same way,' Miss George said. 'The third lot nearly killed him. He ended up in intensive care and we nearly lost him. He picked up a nasty virus and went into septic shock. Bone marrow biopsies have now revealed Jake's cancer cells are gone. Having had one session of chemotherapy since tests showed the cancer is gone, he has only one left to go. Miss George said: 'He's been absolutely amazing. 'They've done awful things to him - weekly lumbar punctures, bone marrow biopsies, chemo. 'He has bloods taken every single day - and he just deals with it. Tests show thankfully Jake is now cancer free and his mother hopes they may be able to return to their home in Cumbria soon. He is pictured here at four years old before his treatment . 'When he's in pain he lies there quietly and deals with it, when he's well he's like he is today. I haven't seen Jake as well since last year.' After moving to Manchester to be close to Jake, Miss George is hopeful they may both be able to go back to Cumbria soon. She is determined lessons be learned from Jake's experience at FGH. She also worries that his disabilities may have been responsible for treatment she describes as 'disgusting'. On one occasion, she says, her son's evident agony almost brought her to tears, yet she was asked by a doctor whether his behaviour was due to his autism. Miss George says her son has been 'amazing' in handling the treatment . And she believes 'arrogance' led Jake's doctor to ignore her fears after she requested a second opinion on his condition. Miss George says: 'I know my little boy inside out, I know him better than anyone else does. 'I understand his body language, every little look on his face, his behaviour. 'Jake doesn't talk, he doesn't do sign language, he can't communicate - but I read him. That's how it's always had to be. So the fact that they wouldn't listen to me or take me seriously is disgusting.' She added: 'If I hadn't brought him down here, he would have died from infection. 'Yes, I understand childhood cancer is rare, but it's not that rare. The symptoms were there, I suspected it, so why didn't they?' George Nasmyth, medical director for the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust, said: 'We are very sorry that the paediatric service at Furness General Hospital did not meet the standards of care expected by Jake and his family, and we are investigating thoroughly. 'The findings of our analysis will be shared with the family in due course, and we will listen and respond directly to their concerns.' In the meantime, Miss George is keeping people up to date on her son's progress via Jake's Journey Facebook page, which has almost 1,000 followers.

"Energy drinks are as harmful as drugs and should be banned from schools, according to a government adviser. Drinks such as Monster, Red Bull and Relentless combine sugar and caffeine in such high quantities that children are becoming hyperactive and difficult to control. Some 500ml cans contain the equivalent of more than 13 teaspoons of sugar and 160mg of caffeine – which is about the same as in four cans of cola. Energy: Drinks such as Monster, Red Bull and Relentless combine sugar and caffeine in such high quantities that children are becoming hyperactive and difficult to control, a Government adviser has warned . Manufacturers and retailers have a . voluntary ban on the sale of the drinks to under-16s, but there is no . law to stop children buying them. Yesterday government adviser John Vincent warned: ‘Energy drinks are effectively another form of drugs.’ Mr . Vincent, who co-founded the Leon restaurant group, is part of a team . recruited by the Government to improve the nutrition of meals served to . youngsters. He said: ‘The amount of sugar and caffeine in these drinks . is in our view effectively allowing drugs into schools. ‘We . don’t do that and neither do we think that should be part of school . life. It has a hugely damaging effect on their ability to concentrate, . how they feel and it is having health effects.’ Fears: Government adviser John Vincent (pictured left with Leon co-founder Henry Dimbleby) has said that energy drinks are 'effectively another form of drugs' X . Factor judge Sharon Osbourne also said yesterday that she blamed energy . drinks for a seizure suffered by her daughter Kelly last year. The . 29-year-old spent five days in hospital after having a fit and . collapsing. And evidence from teachers and pupils is that children who drink these cans may report feeling sick, shaky and dizzy. Ian Fenn, headmaster of Burnage Media Arts College in Manchester, has banned the drinks following requests from staff. He . told the BBC: ‘Staff came to me and said – at a school where we are . very conscious about the nutritional value of what they eat – we cannot . allow boys to bring in drinks that are really unhealthy for them and . consume not one, but two or three.’ Claire . Duggan, a schools public health adviser, said some children report . feeling unwell after downing the drinks. ‘They say the rush that it gave . them could be quite scary if you drank it very fast,’ she added. Blame: Sharon Osbourne (right) said she blamed energy drinks for a seizure suffered by her 29-year-old daughter, Kelly (left), last year . The . Food Standards Agency advises that children limit their intake of . drinks that are high in caffeine. A spokesman added that consuming the . drinks ‘could potentially lead to short-term effects such as increased . excitability, irritability, nervousness or anxiety’. Some . children are even opting to have an energy drink for breakfast rather . than a bowl of cereal. A survey published in the autumn found that one . in 20 teenagers goes to school on a can of energy drink. Brian . Lightman, of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ‘They . are in no fit state to be in the classroom. They can be hyperactive, . and it can have a very negative effect on their behaviour.’ The . British Soft Drinks Association code of conduct states that energy . drinks should not be sold in schools. But a Freedom of Information . request last year found some academies – which have the right to opt out . of national standards on school food and nutrition – were selling the . drinks.

"New Jersey governor Chris Christie has lost at least 100 pounds since undergoing gastric band surgery last year, according to a leading doctor in weight loss surgery. Despite having visibly slimmed down since undergoing the surgery in February 2013, Christie has to date refused to put a figure on his weight loss. But a doctor who was shown before and after pictures of the potential Republican presidential candidate - once an estimated 200 pounds overweight - believes he has shed at least half of those excess pounds. Chris Christie in November 2012 (left) and two years later in November 2014 (right) after weight loss surgery. Doctors believe he has lost at least 100 pounds since undergoing Lap-Band surgery in February 2013 . 'He's lost 100 pounds, if not a little bit more, which puts him on a very good track,' Dr Jaime Ponce, former president of the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery, told The Record of north Jersey. 'The pictures are very impressive,' he added, responding to the photos provided by the newspaper. Christie, 52, has struggled with his weight for years and said he decided to have the Lap-band surgery for his 'long-term health'. But his remarkable weight loss has led to speculation the governor is getting in shape  to make a bid for the White House. Christie has not yet announced any plans for the 2016 election, but he  is contemplating a presidential run for 2016 - and a slimmed-down physique may be part of the groundwork. New Jersey Governor Christie, 52, has struggled with his weight for years and said he decided to have the Lap-band surgery in 2013 for his 'long-term health' According to the New York Times, in September Christie told donors who attended an event hosted by billionaire David Koch in New York that he understood that he needed to shed a few pounds if he wanted to move beyond Trenton. But in May last year, Christie revealed that he had chosen to undergo weight loss surgery due to family considerations. Adjustable gastric banding - often referred to as Lap-Band surgery - is considered the least invasive of the weight loss surgeries. It involves an inflatable device placed around the top portion of the stomach to create a smaller stomach pouch. The surgery is intended to slow consumption of food and so reduce the quantity of food consumed. The procedure is often done on an outpatient basis and the surgery typically takes less than an hour. Weight loss is usually gradual and steady. The band can be adjusted by a doctor after the initial surgery. Risks include obstructions, band slippage, difficulty swallowing, infection and nutritional deficiency. According to The Record, speaking at a promotional event in Princeton, Christie opened up about his struggle with his weight. He said: 'The things that really got me down, the moments where I would say to myself, 'Why can't I beat this? Why can't I do better?', it would be when I'd be going out with [wife] Mary Pat on a Friday night or Saturday night. 'I'd be changing out of my professional clothes ... and would go to casual clothes that I didn't wear a lot, and then something wouldn't fit,' he said. 'That's when I'd really be angry with myself.' He said the public reaction to his disclosure that he had had lap band surgery was 'absolutely insane and over the top'. Christie said he often hears from people who 'don't understand' what it's like to struggle with being overweight. 'It's not as simple as, 'Push yourself away from the table and you'll be fine,' he added. Christie's doctor released a report in October 2013 while the governor was running for re-election stating that Christie 'has adopted a healthy lifestyle,' including a good diet and regular exercise. Dr Rachana Kulkarni wrote that Mr Christie 'has taken a very proactive role in his health. 'He is aware of being overweight and has taken several measure to address this issue.' According to USA Today, the doctor explained that Mr Christie's one-hour workouts included aerobic exercises and resistance training.","The New Jersey governor underwent weight loss surgery in February 2013 .

"For Beth Johnsson, having a daughter with Rett Syndrome is ‘like losing a child you still have.’ Until she was 18 months old, Hannah was alert, responsive and developing normally. Yet, Beth, 35, an English teacher, explains: ‘Very suddenly, the beautiful baby we knew slowly began to disappear – she was alive, but we couldn’t get to her.’ Hannah is now six yet has the mental capabilities of an 18-month-old – a reality that is only too stark when she is playing with her brothers Matthew, three, and Noah, who is almost two. Close: Coleen Rooney with sister Rosie who died in January this year after suffering from Rett Syndrome . Just like her baby brother, she frequently screams, tries to eat everything within arm’s distance, pulls her hair (and her brother’s) and finds it hard to support her own weight. Yet now scientists may be close to eliminating the condition. Astonishingly, Rett Syndrome (RS) – which also afflicted Coleen Rooney’s little sister, Rosie, who died aged 14 in January – has been reversed in mice. One child in 12,000 is born with RS, yet few people have heard of it. The genetic disorder affects almost exclusively females, causing them to regress neurologically and physically. The progression of the disease can be roughly divided into four stages. During the first stage, from about the age of six to 18 months, a baby slows in development, loses interest in play, stops making eye contact, starts walking awkwardly and makes repetitive hand movements. Slowly going: Beth Johnson describes life with her six-year-old daughter Hannah, who has the mental capability of an 18-month-old, like 'losing a child you still have' The second stage, known as ‘rapid destruction’, begins between the ages of one and four. The child finds it increasingly difficult to communicate and learn and there is often a deterioration in other brain functions. Symptoms include an inability to control the hands, sudden distress teamed with screaming, unsteadiness, breathing problems, difficulty sleeping, slow head growth and digestive problems. The third stage, the ‘plateau’, begins between age three and ten. Limbs become floppy, epilepsy may develop and there may be weight loss and teeth-grinding. However, many parents say children are less distressed and show more interest in their surroundings. The final stage can last for decades. Usually severe bending of the spine – scoliosis – develops, as well as losing the ability to walk. Almost all cases are caused by a mutation in the MECP2 gene which prevents nerve cells in the brain from working properly. Currently there is no cure and only the symptoms are treated. Sufferers can live to their  40s but most die before 25. Beth and her husband Vince, 37, from Sutton in Surrey, first noticed something was wrong when Hannah started to react oddly to people’s emotions. ‘Her normal responses reversed – she would become very distressed when someone laughed,’ says Beth. ‘This was accompanied by screaming which was difficult to bear.’ There was a sudden slowing in her development, and nursery workers noticed she had started to shake occasionally. Beth and Vince took Hannah to the doctor but they were reassured there was nothing wrong with her because she was reaching all her milestones, albeit slowly. But Hannah continued to regress until she started to pull out her hair in handfuls. ‘Even at this point no one could tell me what was wrong with her,’ adds Beth. ‘It was incredibly frustrating.’ Finally, tests revealed the true cause. When the couple were given the news they were strictly told not to search the internet about the condition and to ‘carry on as normal’. Doctors wanted to prevent them frightening themselves. ‘I’m not sure I’d have managed to  get out of bed if I’d known what lay ahead,’ Beth admits. Since then there has been a steady decline in Hannah’s abilities. She wakes throughout the night for hours at a time and needs a strict routine, otherwise she screams for long periods. Beth says: ‘Life is certainly not how I’d envisaged it to be. You have to be five steps ahead of Hannah all the time because if you don’t foresee an upset to her routine, there can be difficult consequences. Even if you are a few minutes late in serving up food, she will become very upset, start screaming and throw things across the room. You learn to appreciate the smallest things. One great smile from Hannah can make your day, and you can find yourself feeling very lucky.’ Hannah currently does not take any medication. Beth admits they had worried about the impact Hannah might have on their two sons but say they are happy and adore their sister. Until recently, neurodevelopmental conditions were thought to be irreversible. Yet there is hope from the Edinburgh University research which in 2007 reversed RS symptoms in mice. ‘That took our breath away,’ says Dr Adrian Bird, who led the study. The mice were infected with a virus that altered the gene and reversed symptoms. ‘Mice are different from humans, but it is a very strong indicator that therapies could be developed in our lifetime,’ says Dr Bird. For Beth, the research is the light at the end of the tunnel and she will work tirelessly to raise money until there is a therapy for Hannah. She says: ‘I refuse to lose hope.’ See reverserett.org.uk .","Rett Syndrome causes neurological and physical regression .

"Two transplant patients died after receiving kidneys from the same alcoholic donor - which had already been rejected as 'unfit' by several other hospitals, an inquest has heard. Father-of-six Darren Hughes, 42, and new grandfather Robert 'Jim' Stuart, 67, were kept in the dark by doctors at a Welsh NHS hospital about the lifestyle of their donor. Mr Stuart, from Cardiff, and Mr Hughes, of Bridgend, both underwent the operations at the University Hospital of Wales last year, where they were given kidneys infected with the deadly parasitic worm halicephalobus. Darren Hughes, 42, of Bridgend, (pictured left) and Robert Stuart, 67, from Cardiff, (right) both died after receiving an 'infected kidney' from an alcoholic donor, an inquest in Cardiff has heard . Post-mortem examinations revealed that both men had the parasite in their bodies. Cardiff Coroner's Court heard that there have only been five known cases like this worldwide in humans - all of which have proved fatal. Both men died of meningoencephalitis, an inflammation of the brain caused by the parasite. The inquest was told by relatives of both men that they had been informed that the donor's organs had been rejected by several other hospitals after being deemed 'unfit for transplant' - but they were only told after their loved ones had already died. Mr Hughes's father, Ian, told the hearing he would not have signed the consent form for his disabled son had he known the organ came from an alcoholic. He said: 'I ended up signing Darren's death warrant. 'I thought the donor was a person who had died in a car crash locally. We knew nothing about the donor's lifestyle. 'The first time we knew anything was wrong was after Darren's death.' Mr Hughes said: 'After he died we were told that the donor lived rough, was alcoholic, had cirrhosis of the liver and that they didn't know the cause of the meningitis that killed him. 'We find it difficult to understand why the hospital in Cardiff used these kidneys. They had been rejected from all other hospitals - all his other organs were considered unfit for transplant.' That sentiment was echoed by Mr Stuart's widow Judith. She said her husband, who needed dialysis after suffering septicaemia, had been in good health before being bumped up the waiting list. The family of Darren Hughes outside his inquest at Cardiff Coroner's Court - from left to right his mother Jackie Hughes, dad Ian Hughes and sister Vanessa Gordon . 'He coped very well on dialysis,' she added. 'He was very upbeat about the future and would have been happy to stay on dialysis for the rest of his life. 'He was in surprising good health for someone who needed a transplant. 'The nurses (on the transplant ward) once joked to him 'What are you doing here, you're in far too good health, you shouldn't be here'.' Mrs Stuart added she had been told nothing about the donor - disputing accusations her husband had been told. 'I maintain my husband did not properly consent to the operation,' she said. The hearing was told Mr Stuart was told his donor had liver cirrhosis 'while in theatre' before being given anaesthetic. Mrs Stuart said: 'Even if this conversation did happen I do not think he would have been aware (of what was going on).' Acting coroner Christopher John Woolley said both the men had a transplant at University Hospital Wales last November. For Mr Hughes, it was his third transplant, while it was Mr Stuart's first. But following a successful operation, Mr Hughes's condition began to deteriorate and an initial diagnosis of viral meningitis was made. He died on December 15. His father said: 'Our opinion was that Darren was not going to improve and he was being used as a guinea pig.' Mr Stuart and Mr Hughes both underwent the operations at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff (pictured) last year, where they were given kidneys infected with the deadly parasitic worm halicephalobus . Mr Hughes senior said he had a meeting with health officials the following month and was told 'all other hospitals had rejected' the donors' organs - including eyes, lungs, liver and heart - because they were considered unfit for transplants. Mr Stuart's wife, Judith, said her husband had twice been told a transplant match had been found, only for the operation to be cancelled. At 2am on November 30, he was told a new match had been found. 'I was told the operation went very well and the kidney was scanned in recovery,' Mrs Stuart said. 'He continued to make good progress and was passing urine.' He was discharged from hospital on December 6 and attended a follow-up appointment four days later. Later that day Mrs Stuart said her husband became 'very confused'. She said: 'He kept asking where his father was - even though he had died years ago.' He was then readmitted to hospital, where he was sent to intensive care. He died on December 17. The inquest heard no post mortem had been carried out on the donor following his unusual death before his organs were offered for transplant. The inquest also heard the organs of the donor had been rejected by every hospital they had been offered to before they were accepted by the University of Wales Hospital in Cardiff. The kidneys had been described in documents as 'poor function'. Mr Hughes told Cardiff Coroner's Court about the final desperate days of his son's life as the parasite in his infected kidney. He said: 'Darren couldn't feel his legs, couldn't control his bowels and was coming in and out of consciousness. 'He said: 'Dad I am frightened, I am scared, I don't know what is happening. No more hospital Dad, I have had enough'.' Mr Hughes said he asked how his wife Andrea was before slipping into a coma which he never came out of. A representative for the University of Wales Hospital suggested that the surgeon had told them prior to the transplant that the donor had died of a brain infection which was low risk. Mr Hughes said: 'No, that is not true, that is false.' The inquest was told the halicephalobus parasite lives in soil, manure and compost. Its occurance is rare in animals - although it can be found in horses. Acting coroner Mr Woolley heard neither of the men who died had had contact with horses prior to their death. The inquest continues.","Robert Stuart and Darren Hughes both died after having transplant surgery .

"Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer was revered for his strikingly realistic 17th century paintings because they were able to capture light and detail like never before. Yet in 2006 fellow artist David Hockney stirred up controversy by claiming Vermeer was only able to paint this well because he used a lens and mirror contraption – similar to a camera obscura. Since then art critics have come out in support of both Vermeer and Hockney, but one inventor now claims to have finally solved the mystery – and he is 95 per cent sure Hockney’s theories are correct. Scroll down for video... Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer was revered for his strikingly realistic 17th century paintings because they were able to capture light and detail like never before. Pictured is Vermeer's 'The Music Lesson' Inventor Tim Jenison, 58, was given Hockney’s book Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters by his daughter in 2002, according to a report in Vanity Fair. Jenison claimed he had a hunch that what Hockney was saying about Vermeer was true and then one day while in the bath, he realised that the images could be created by projecting the subject through a lens onto a mirror that would have been positioned in Vermeer’s line of sight. The Texas-born production editor then travelled to Amsterdam to look at Vermeer’s work, studied the locations where Vermeer painted in his hometown of Delft, and learned to read Dutch. 'Looking at their Vermeers,' he said 'I had an epiphany.' 'The photographic tone is what jumped out at me. Why was Vermeer so realistic? Because he got the (colour) values right.' Jenison also tested out various contraptions to discover which was the most likely. VIDEO: Magician Teller discusses Tim Jenison's Vermeer . A camera obscura is based on the principle that when some of the rays reflected from a bright subject pass through a small hole in thin material, they reform as an upside down on a surface parallel to the hole. In 2006 artist David Hockney accused Vermeer of using a contraption similar to this . One of the strongest counterarguments against Hockney’s claims was that if Vermeer had used a camera obscura, the image would have been upside down, but Jenison discovered that using a second mirror solved this problem. His final design, which Jenison claims he is 95 per cent sure would have been how Vermeer would had painted his masterpieces, involves two mirrors and a four-inch lens. The image is projected through the lens onto a 7-inch concave mirror fixed to the wall opposite. This mirror bounces the image onto a smaller 2 x 4-inch mirror situated next to the canvas. If Vermeer used this system, he would have been able to paint with little movement of his head and capture the light and detail more accurately. Early models of the camera obscura were large; comprising either a whole darkened room or a tent. By the 18th century, following developments by Robert Boyle and Robert Hooke, more easily portable models became available . To test his theory, Jenison has spent the past decade – a total of 220 hours - recreating the room Vermeer would have painted in and attempting to recreate his 1662 painting The Music Lesson. He also made lenses that would have been made using 17th century techniques and only painted with pigments available in the late 1600s. American illusionists Penn and Teller installed cameras in Jenison's studio to record everything. They now plan to turn the footage into an 80-minute film. The film, named 'Tim's Vermeer' will be released in February. If you go into a dark room on a sunny day and make a tiny hole in a window, you’ll see a strange effect on the opposite wall – the world outside the window will be shown upside down. This is because light travels in a straight line. When some of the rays reflected from a bright subject pass through a small hole in thin material, they reform as an upside down on a surface parallel to the hole . Chinese philosopher Mo-Ti is thought to be the first person to mention this phenomenon in the 5th century BC.  In 13th-century England, Roger Bacon described the use of a camera obscure for the safe observation of solar eclipses.  In 1490 Leonardo Da Vinci gave two clear descriptions of the camera obscura in his notebooks. Early models were large; comprising either a whole darkened room or a tent. By the 18th century, following developments by Robert Boyle and Robert Hooke, more easily portable models became available. Unlike tradiational models, Vermeer's camera obscura would have used two mirrors and a four-inch lens. The . image would have been projected through the lens onto a 7-inch concave mirror fixed . to the wall opposite. This mirror bounced the image onto a smaller 2 x . 4-inch mirror situated next to the canvas. If .

"The first and only transgender professional mixed martial arts fighter Fallon Fox may actually be at a disadvantage for having been born a man. Fox, 38, who was born Boyd Burton in East Toledo, Ohio, revealed her medical history to the MMA and larger world this past March and received intense criticism about her fitness to compete. But a spectacular October loss that ended her undefeated streak was leaves her wondering if electing to remove all male hormones has her at a disadvantage against biological females whose bodies create just a little of the endurance-enhancing hormone. Super woman: Transgender MMA fighter Fallon Fox has faced heaps of criticism over her biological past, but a shocking October end to her undefeated streak has some wondering if her full male to female transition actually puts her at a disadvantage against biological women . 'I guess they'll come out of the woodwork now,' Fox told GQ as part of an in-depth profile of the fighter published in the January 2014 issue. 'They were afraid before, but now they'll all want to beat a woman who used to be a man.' Fox was all but devastated following the October 12 brawl against Ashlee Evans-Smith and confided in the GQ writer about her feeling of helplessness. 'I don't know what happened...For some reason, I just can't make it past the first round,' she said. 'I run out of gas. I have to figure this out.' Intense: Fox trains intensely and has a long-held dream of making it big as a female MMA fighter, but her virtual lack of any male hormones could mean biological women--who produce a small amount of endurance-enhancing testosterone--are actually at an advantage . Blind-sided: Fox was undefeated until October, when her streak fell to Ashlee Evans-Smith and left her in total shock . Bitter irony: Because she no testicles and takes 16 milligrams of estrogen every morning, Fox could have significantly less testosterone than some of her female competitors . GQ speculates that Fox, who traveled to Thailand in 2006 to undergo both top and bottom surgeries, may be experiencing an unwanted side effect from her transition into female. Biologically, she may be too female. Like the male testicles, women's ovaries produce testosterone--though, in a very small amount. Also like men, the testosterone can help naturally increase a woman's endurance. Fox has neither organs and that fact paired with her heavy daily dose of estrogen means she also has virtually no testosterone.

"When Janet Howes died suddenly 17 years ago, her devoted husband Winston decided he wanted to create a lasting tribute to her. The farmer planted thousands of oak saplings in a six-acre  field – but left a heart-shaped  area in the middle, with the  point facing towards his wife’s childhood home. And as the remarkable picture here shows, his romantic labour of love has now grown into a mature meadow, a peaceful oasis where Mr Howes can sit and remember his wife of 33 years.

Young couple: Mr Howes with his wife in 1960. They married two years later in 1962 but he was devastated after her sudden death in 1995 and planted the trees in her memory . The meadow cannot be seen from the . road and remained a family secret until a passing hot air balloonist . took this photograph from the air after discovering it accidentally. Mr Howes, 70, said yesterday: ‘I came up with the idea of creating a heart in the clearing of the field after Janet died. ‘I thought it was a great idea – it . was a flash of inspiration – and I planted several thousand oak trees. Once it was completed we put a seat in the field, overlooking the hill . near where she used to live. ‘I sometimes go down there, just to . sit and think about things. It is a lovely and lasting tribute to her . which will be here for years.’ Secret garden: The heart forms a peaceful oasis among the trees where Mr Howes can go to remember his beloved wife.

Aerial view: Photographs taken today from a helicopter show clearly the path leading up to the clearing in the middle of the woods . Mr Howes, who owns a 112-acre farm . near Wickwar, Gloucestershire, married Janet in 1962. She died from . heart failure in 1995, aged 50. He created the wood next to his farmhouse in the months after her death, marking out the massive heart shape with a large hedge. The entrance to the secret heart is accessible only from a track leading up to its tip. Mr Howes added: ‘We got people in especially to do it – there are several thousand trees. ‘We planted large oak trees around the . edge of the heart then decided to put a hedge around it too. The heart . points towards Wotton Hill, where Janet is from. We plant daffodils in . the middle that come up in the spring – it looks great. I go out there . from time to time and sit in the seat I created.’ Mr Howes created the impressive memorial with help from his son. It remains hidden from nearby roads and can only be viewed from the sky . Mr Howes added: ‘I also flew over it myself about five years ago.’ The farmer’s memorial was revealed in . all its glory after keen hot air balloonist Andy Collett, 42, from . nearby Wotton-Under-Edge, flew over the wood last week. The transport businessman could not believe his eyes when he discovered the symbol of love hidden among the trees below. He said: ‘I have my own balloon and am quite a regular flyer, but this was the most amazing sight I have ever seen from the sky. ‘It was a perfect heart hidden away from view – you would not know it was there.’ Mr Collett added: ‘You can just imagine the love story.’","Bereft Winston Howes planted the sapling oaks 17 years ago .

"A pastor's wife bought a pistol from a gun shop before shooting herself dead in her Lexus sedan in the store's parking lot, police have said. Harriet Deison, 65, was found dead in her car near the McClelland Gun Shop in East Dallas, Texas at 2.15pm on Saturday after witnesses heard two shots and smoke coming out of the vehicle. Police believe Deison, a married mother of two and grandmother to five, shot herself with the pistol she had just purchased from the shop. The death has been ruled a suicide. Police found no suicide note at the scene and have not provided detail . into what led to her death. Tragic: Harriet Deison, left, has been found dead in her car outside a gun shop after apparently buying the weapon and shooting herself in the head. She was married to Pete Deison, a pastor (right) The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives will now send an investigator to the shop, a family-run business open since the 1970s. Dallas police Sgt. Shelley Johnston told the Dallas Morning News that police will determine whether legal . procedures were followed before Mrs Deison bought the gun. In these situations, the ATF reviews the shop's procedures and the . application the customer completed before buying the gun, ATF spokesman Andrew Young told the Morning News. Before the purchase, a . customer must fill out a form with personal information, show a . government-issued ID and pass a background check. The process takes around 20 minutes, Young said. Missed: Police have not yet revealed what pushed the 65-year-old grandmother to kill herself . Questions: Witnesses heard two gunshots and saw smoke coming from her Lexus sedan, police said . 'At that point, if the background . check is passed, they buy a gun and walk out with a gun,' Young said, adding that there is no waiting period in the state. Yet the bureau does tell business owners to refrain from selling firearms to people if they appear drunk, mentally unstable or if it appears they have been coerced into buying the gun. 'We recommend during the application . process if there’s anything that seems wrong or illogical, don’t do the . sale. It’s not worth the small amount of profit,' he said. But he said that tragedies can occur despite business owners following the law. 'It's really hard on the dealers when someone . buys a gun and takes their life with the gun in the parking lot,' he said. Shop: McClelland Gun Shop, where she bought the gun.

"Sitting pretty: Marina Asenova says her face was used on Sally Hansen cosmetics but she never received a payment . A model agency is apparently refusing to pay one its former female talents for a near decade-long endorsement deal with Sally Hansen, made without her permission. Marina Asenova from Bulgaria, decided to sue New York-based MC2 Models last year after she spotted her image plastered on boxes of hair removal and bleaching cream while a trip to the U.S. She claimed she was unaware of the modelling contract and never received payment. Instead, the agency, which should have made a small percentage from the deal, took the full cut. However, its co-founder Jeffrey Fuller told the Daily News that it does not owe the five-foot-nine-inch brunette anything because 'it no longer represents her' and she was 'an average model at best'. He continued: 'Ms. Asenova was never a supermodel . . . It’s a shame her career has dwindled down to the point [where she’s suing for money].' He apparently claims that he can no longer find payment records and he told MailOnline that she has been ‘paid in full’ based on the original terms. Now a frustrated Ms Asenova has turned her attention to Sally Hansen's parent company, Coty Cosmetics, which she claims continue to use her image. Last week she filed an amended suit in Manhattan Supreme Court demanding that the beauty giant pulls items with her face on, off shelves. Her lawyer, Tom Mullaney says his client just wants the money she is owed. 'She wasn’t too average to hire, but she was too average to pay,' he explained. 'I hope they tell that to the judge.' Ms Asenova was represented by MC2 Models while she lived in Manhattan, but parted ways with the agency when she returned to Europe in 2006. Products: Ms Asenova's smiling face on a box of hair bleaching cream . Image: She is uncertain how much the modelling contract was worth . But on a trip back to the city, she . nipped into a Duane Reade pharmacy and saw her image had been used on . hair removal and hair bleaching products. Modelling . agency MC2 Models never paid her for the deal with Coty Cosmetics - . then Sally Hansen Cosmetics - according to court papers. 'I guess they figured she'd never find out about it,' her lawyer Mr Mullaney previously told the New York Post. Ms . Asenova filed a lawsuit against MC2 Models, which has offices in New . York, Miami and Tel Aviv, charging them with breach of contract and . unjust enrichment. She allegedly claimed that 80per cent of the money earned from the campaign should be hers . Spotted: Ms Asenova was stunned when she saw her face on the products in a Duane Reade store while on a trip back to New York City . Yet . the exact amount is not clear, as MC2 Models is allegedly refusing to let her . know how much they earned from the deal, or even show her the contract. She . discovered her face on products in the hair care aisle, including brush . on hair remover, in which she appears to be holding an applicator to . the camera. Her face also appears on hair bleach products, which bear the Sally Hansen logo. Cover model Ms Asenova has appeared in campaigns for Yves Saint Laurent and Olay, among others. She also has representation in London, Switzerland and Germany. A rep for Coty Cosmetics declined to comment on the matter.","Marina Asenova from Bulgaria, spotted her image plastered on boxes of hair removal and bleaching cream .

She is joined by Ronnie Corbett, who is also appointed a CBE, writer and  broadcaster Clive James, CBE, TV presenter Lorraine Kelly, OBE, former It’s A Knockout host Stuart Hall, OBE, and actor David  Harewood, MBE. Miss Bonham Carter, 45, said she will accept her appointment in memory of her father, Raymond, who died in 2004 after many years of serious illness following a brain tumour. She added: ‘I am thrilled, though not sure that I deserve it. ‘I always thought my father deserved a medal for facing 25 years of chronic disability with quiet daily heroism so I am delighted to accept such a wonderful honour in his memory. ‘I am wondering does it mean I get to command, because at the moment it’s my four-year-old daughter who does the commanding in our household. Must inform her of the change in situation.’ The mother of two made her Hollywood breakthrough 25 years ago with her role in A Room With  A View. Since then, she has appeared in blockbusters including Fight Club, Alice in Wonderland and Planet Of The Apes – where she met her partner, film director Tim Burton. Famed for her eccentric style of dressing, all eyes will be on her when she meets the Queen – who is said to have enjoyed the actress’s portrayal of her late mother. Ronnie Corbett’s CBE will go alongside the OBE he was awarded by the Queen in 1978 along with his long-term comedy partner  Ronnie Barker. Proud moment: Lorraine Kelly's OBE was awarded for services to charity and the Armed Forces .

'Yet it did not have the same shape or pattern as the Chelyabinsk meteorite which exploded over the Urals in February 2103. 'Inevitably, web versions claimed it could have caused by a UFO.'

"Scientists claim there is no evidence to support taking vitamin D supplements to stave off chronic disease and early death . Scientists claim there is no evidence to support taking vitamin D supplements to stave off chronic disease and early death - and results of several multi-million dollar trials currently under way are unlikely to alter this view. A new review examines existing evidence from 40 randomised controlled trials - the gold standard for proving cause and effect - and concludes that vitamin D supplementation does not prevent heart attacks, strokes, cancer, or bone fractures in the general population by more than 15 per cent. In fact, vitamin D supplements probably provide little, if any, health benefit, according to the study published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology journal. In Britain, the supplements market is worth £700 million a year - a growth of 16 per cent in five years - and the most popular pills are multi-vitamins and fish oils, which contain vitamin D. Some scientists assumed vitamin D, which is produced naturally by exposure to sunlight, could protect against disease because patients with cancer, heart disease or Alzheimer’s, or who died prematurely, often had very low levels of the nutrient. However, evidence from some trials suggests that rather than vitamin D deficiency leading to disease, these illnesses stop the body from producing vitamin D - so sufferers have lower levels. Last month, a review of 462 studies involving more than a million adults said a lack of vitamin D was not a trigger for many common illnesses. In the latest study, Dr Mark Bolland of the University of Auckland, New Zealand, and colleagues used several types of review of existing studies, including a ‘futility analysis’, to predict whether future research results might sway existing evidence. Some scientists assumed vitamin D, which is produced naturally by exposure to sunlight, could protect against disease because patients with cancer, heart disease or Alzheimer's . The results of their study suggest the . effect of vitamin D, taken with or without calcium, on heart attacks, . strokes, cancer, and total fracture lies below a ‘futility threshold’. This means there would be no point in taking supplements as it would have little effect on health outcomes. For hip fractures, the results of some trials even suggested an increased risk with vitamin D supplementation. Pregnant women and those who are breastfeeding are advised to take one vitamin D tablet a day - which they can get on prescription - to ensure their baby's bones are healthy . The authors’ analysis of whether vitamin D supplementation can reduce death rates by five per cent or more was inconclusive. Professor . Karl Michaëlsson, of Uppsala University in Sweden, writing in a Lancet . commentary, said: ‘Without stringent indications - i.e. supplementing . those without true vitamin D insufficiency - there is a legitimate fear . that vitamin D supplementation might actually cause net harm.’ Two months ago the chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies, called for free vitamins to be given to children after it emerged that a quarter of youngsters are short of vitamin D. Presently it is only available on prescription to under fives from low income families. In addition, pregnant women and those who are breastfeeding are advised to take one vitamin D tablet a day - which they can get on prescription - to ensure their baby’s bones are healthy. Dr Carrie Ruxton from the Health Supplements Information Service, said three quarters of Britons have vitamin D intakes which are below the recommended level, with children and older people are at particular risk.’ She said: ‘Rickets, once thought to have largely disappeared in the UK, has returned, in particular among children of Asian and African descent who have darker skins, but the disease is also seen in Causasian children usually in areas of urban deprivation. She said the new review did not look at vitamin D’s role in bone health, instead focusing on chronic conditions such as cancer. She added: ‘Vitamin D supplements are not intended for treating any disease conditions, and it is disappointing this review did not address the essential role of vitamin D in bone and musculoskeletal health. ‘In the light of the findings that 75 per cent of the British population have below recommended intakes of vitamin D and that vitamin D is essential for bone health as well as a number of other physiological functions, consideration should be given to everyone taking a vitamin D supplement all year round.","Review finds vitamin D supplementation does not prevent heart .

"Doctors now have convincing evidence that they put HIV into remission, hopefully for good, in a Mississippi baby born with the AIDS virus — a medical first that is prompting a new look at how hard and fast such cases should be treated. The case was reported earlier this year but some doctors were skeptical that the baby was really infected rather than testing positive because of exposure to virus in the mom's blood. The new report, published online Wednesday by the New England Journal of Medicine, makes clear that the girl, now 3, was infected in the womb. She was treated unusually aggressively and shows no active infection despite stopping AIDS medicines 18 months ago. A Cure? Dr. Deborah Persaud specializes in juvenile HIV and helped research the case . Doctors won't call it a cure because they don't know what proof or how much time is needed to declare someone free of HIV infection, long feared to be permanent. 'We want to be very cautious here. We're calling it remission because we'd like to observe the child for a longer time and be absolutely sure there's no rebound,' said Dr. Katherine Luzuriaga, a University of Massachusetts AIDS expert involved in the baby's care. The government's top AIDS scientist, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, agreed. 'At minimum, the baby is in a clear remission. It is possible that the baby has actually been cured. We don't have a definition for cure as we do for certain cancers, where after five years or so you can be relatively certain the person is not going to go and relapse,' he said. A scientist at his institute did sophisticated tests that showed no active virus in the child. A government-sponsored international study starting in January aims to test early treatment in babies born with HIV to see if the results in this case can be reproduced. Normally the virus (pictured as seen under a microscope) rebounds if treatment stops . Most HIV-infected moms in the U.S. get AIDS medicines during pregnancy, which greatly cuts the chances they will pass the virus to their babies. But the Mississippi mom got no prenatal care and her HIV was discovered during labor. Doctors considered the baby to be at such high risk that they started the child on three powerful medicines 30 hours after birth, rather than waiting for a test to confirm infection as is usually done. Within a month, the baby's virus fell to undetectable levels. She remained on treatment until she was 18 months old when doctors lost contact with her. Ten months later when she returned, they could find no sign of infection even though the mom had stopped giving the child AIDS medicines. Only one other person is thought to have been cured of HIV infection — a San Francisco man who had a bone marrow transplant in 2007 from a donor with natural resistance to HIV, and showed no sign of infection five years later. In the Mississippi baby, 'there's no immune mechanism we can identify that would keep the virus in check' like that bone marrow donor, said another study author, Dr. Deborah Persaud of the Johns Hopkins Children's Center, who helped investigate the case because she has researched treatment in children. A 'functional cure' for HIV/AIDS can be achieved for some patients diagnosed early, according to new research. Image shows a conceptual view of HIV in the bloodstream . Dr. Peter Havens, pediatric HIV chief at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin and a government adviser on HIV treatment guidelines, said the child may have an undiscovered genetic trait that helped her manage the virus. 'I'm just not convinced that her dramatic response would be replicable in a large population,' he said. It's too soon to recommend treating other high-risk babies so aggressively without more study, he said. In the upcoming study, doctors plan to give AIDS medicines for at least two years and watch for signs of remission before suspending treatment and seeing whether a remission results. The Mississippi case 'did open people's eyes further' about a possible cure, Luzuriaga said. 'We might be able to intervene early and spare children a lifetime of therapy. That is the potential impact of this case.'","After the baby was cured, doctors wondered whether she ever actually had the disease .

"A menopause treatment which could prevent breast cancer, rather than causing it, may soon be available for British women. Evidence shows the new hormone replacement therapy pill is even more effective at combating menopause symptoms, such as hot flushes, than the standard treatment. But crucially, early trials show it may prevent growth of breast cancer tumours. Existing forms of HRT, by contrast, are thought to cause the disease. Breast cancer: New HRT pill is better at combating menopause symptoms and it may prevent growth of breast cancer tumours . Researchers say it could be given to millions of women worldwide who are too afraid to take menopause treatment due to the risk of breast cancer. And they also believe it could be given to younger women with a strong family history of the disease to prevent it occurring. The pill – called Duavee – has just been approved for use in America and will be available in chemists there from January. It is now being considered for use in Britain by the EU watchdog – the European Medicines Agency – which is expected to make a decision in the next few months. The drug contains the hormone oestrogen which combats symptoms of the menopause including hot flushes, night sweats, sleeping problems and thinning of the bones, or osteoporosis. But the problem with oestrogen, which is in standard HRT, is that it is thought to trigger the growth of cancer tumours. To combat this, a chemical called bazedoxifene is added to the Duavee pill, blocking the cancer-causing effects of oestrogen. This means the drug has all the benefits of reducing menopause symptoms as normal HRT but does not trigger breast cancer. Trials on 8,000 women have shown it reduces hot flushes by 85 per cent – making it more effective than standard HRT, which cuts them by 75 per cent. It also prevents fractures caused by bone thinning by 40 per cent and participants said it had improved their overall happiness. How previous pill was linked to disease . But in tests on mice the chemical prevented the growth of breast cancer tumours – and scientists are convinced it will have the same effect on women. Professor Richard Santen of the University of Virginia, who is an expert in the role of oestrogen in breast cancer, said: ‘If this does what we think it does this is huge.’ Unveiling the findings at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine conference in Boston, he added: ‘I’ve been around for 45 years studying breast cancer and when you look at the effects of these agents in animals, the animals have really predicted what’s going to happen in patients.’ Breast cancer is the most common form of the disease in women and in the UK there are just under 50,000 new cases each year and 11,500 deaths. In 2001 and 2002 two major US studies suggested breast cancer was being triggered by HRT leading to millions of women worldwide abandoning the drug. In Britain, the numbers of women on HRT fell by half – only a million now take it today. Doctors are concerned that many are suffering the debilitating symptoms of the menopause and putting themselves at risk of osteoporosis because they are too afraid to take HRT. The new drug’s manufacturer Pfizer has not revealed the cost of the pill – which would be taken once a day – but say it would be comparable to current forms of HRT, which is between £2 and £7 for a month’s supply depending on the type. Professor Santen said that if it was shown to prevent breast cancer, it could be given to thousands of younger women at high risk of the disease. This summer the NHS began offering these women the drug Tamoxifen, but it can have very unpleasant side effects such as depression, tiredness, blood clots, hot flushes and headaches. The professor said trials had so far shown the new pill had limited side effects. The drug could be available in Britain next year if the EU watchdog approves it, although it may take several years to show it prevents breast cancer in humans.","The pill – called Duavee – has just been approved for use in America .

"Paul Hudson, who forecasts for BBC Look North, said nearly every annual global forecast by the Met Office was 'too warm' The Met Office has got every annual global forecast so far this century wrong, bar one, a BBC weatherman said. Paul Hudson, a forecaster for BBC's regional programme Look North, said the Met Office's predictions had been wrong for 13 years out of the last 14, and said the incorrect predictions had all been 'on the warm side' rather than too cold. He said on his BBC weather blog that they had predicted the global temperature in 2013 would be 0.57C above the 1961-1990 average temperature of 14C, when in fact it was only warmer by 0.49C. Mr Hudson, a trained meteorologist with 20 years' experience, said the global average temperature for 2013 meant that: 'So far this century, of 14 yearly headline predictions made by the Met Office Hadley centre, 13 have been too warm.' He added: 'It’s worth stressing that all the incorrect predictions are within the stated margin of error, but having said that, they have all been on the warm side and none have been too cold.' He said the 2013 annual temperature also meant that another Met Office prediction, that half the years between 2010 and 2015 would be hotter than the hottest year on record (1998) was wrong already. The forecaster, who previously worked for the Met Office, wrote: 'The Met Office believe one of the reasons for this ‘warm bias’ in their annual global projections is the lack of observational data in the Arctic circle, which has been the fastest warming area on earth. 'They also suggest another reason why the global surface temperature is falling short of their projections is because some of the heat is being absorbed in the ocean beneath the surface.' A Met Office spokesman said: 'There is evidence that incomplete global coverage of the available temperature observations may have led to an under-representation of regions that were unusually warm.' Climate change sceptic Professor Richard Lindzen yesterday told MPs that whatever they were doing to counteract 'climate change', the only difference it would make would be to the country's economy. Freezing: The Pennines were covered with snow yesterday and forecasters warned of an impending cold snap . He said: 'Whatever the UK is deciding to do vis-a-vis climate will have no impact on your climate.  It will have a profound impact on your economy. 'So you are making a decision to take a problem which might not be a problem, take actions which you know will create problems and feel you have done the right thing.', the Times reported.","BBC's Paul Hudson said nearly every annual global forecast was wrong .

"David Cameron was repeatedly put on the spot yesterday over how far somebody confronted by a raider would be allowed to go under a new ‘bash a burglar’ law unveiled by his party. The Prime Minister – who recounted the ‘terrible’ experience of having his Skoda stolen in a burglary – said he believed intruders gave up their rights when they entered another person’s home. When pressed as to what this meant in practice, he said that the new law would not permit, for example, the stabbing of a burglar who had been knocked unconscious in a struggle. Scroll down for video . Making a point: David Cameron said he believed intruders gave up their rights when they entered another person's home . Bad memories: The Prime Minister recalled when his Skoda was stolen in a burglary (file picture) Crackdown: Chris Grayling wants to 'dispel doubts' over the right to fight off intruders . But the announcement raised questions over the precise boundaries that would apply. Mr Cameron told ITV News: ‘People need . the certainty to know that unless they did something grossly . disproportionate, as we’re going to put it, then they are basically in . the right.’ He added: ‘And frankly when a burglar . crosses your threshold and enters your home, we should worry less about . their rights and worry more about the rights of the household, the home, . the family whose privacy and whose place they are invading.’ He recalled how raiders once burgled . his home then escaped in his car, telling Sky: ‘I’ve been burgled a . couple of times when I lived in London, in North Kensington. There was . one occasion when I left the keys in my car and they loaded up my Skoda . and drove off. It is a horrible feeling when your house has been . invaded.’ Justice Secretary Chris Grayling’s . announcement that he would change the law to allow the use of . ‘disproportionate force’ against burglars in the heat of the moment . delighted MPs at the Tory conference yesterday. Only the use of ‘grossly . disproportionate force’ will remain outlawed. Currently, householders . are entitled to use only ‘reasonable’ force. Campaign: Calls for a change in the law gathered strength after Tony Martin, pictured outside the Norfolk home where he shot two burlgars, was jailed in 2000 . Plans: Theresa May tells the Tory conference that victims will have a greater say in the justice system . The plan was attacked by the civil . liberties group Liberty, whose director Shami Chakrabarti said: . ‘Terrified householders defending themselves are already protected, so . the irresponsible announcement can only be designed to make people . afraid or actually encourage vigilante execution.’ Mr Grayling also pledged that sex attackers and killers would be jailed for life in a new ‘two strikes and you’re out’ policy. Life terms will automatically go to . anyone twice given jail terms of ten years or more for rape, sex crimes . against children, serious GBH and terrorism offences, and ‘causing or . allowing the death of a child’. The Justice Secretary said: ‘Everyone . deserves a second chance. But those who commit the most serious offences . cannot be allowed to just go on and on causing harm, distress and . injury.’ Home Secretary Theresa May also unveiled plans to allow crime victims to decide how the thug should be punished. They will be offered a menu of sanctions – such as ordering offenders to pay compensation or fix the damage they have caused. Any offender who refuses to comply . will face stiff action by the police or courts. Mr Grayling, who will . also promise to toughen community punishments, will delight the Right . with his new law on burglars. It will mean someone who is confronted . by a burglar and has reason to fear for their safety, or their family’s . safety and in the heat of the moment uses force that later seems . ‘disproportionate’ will not be guilty of an offence. Home Secretary... and unofficial minister for fashion: Theresa May's shoes on stage today . Rights: Andy and Tracey Ferrie, pictured, were confronted in their home by burglars . This could include the use of lethal force. Only force which is ‘grossly’ disproportionate will not be permitted. Mr . Grayling said: ‘Being confronted by an intruder in your home is . terrifying, and the public should be in no doubt that the law is on . their side. That is why I am strengthening the current law. ‘Householders who act instinctively and honestly in self-defence are crime victims  and should be treated that way. ‘We . need to dispel doubts in this area once and for all, and I am very . pleased to be delivering on the pledge that we made in Opposition.’ The demands for change began when Mr . Martin was imprisoned for killing one burglar and wounding another who . entered his Norfolk farm. No sympathy: Judge Michael Pert QC spoke out after a lawyer for one of the men who broke into the Ferries' remote farmhouse, pictured, asked for leniency . More . recent cases suggest prosecutors and judges have been giving greater . weight to the legal right of householders to use ‘reasonable force’ to . defend themselves. Last . month Judge Michael Pert QC spoke out after a lawyer demanded leniency . for a criminal who, he said, had been hit with a shotgun by Andy Ferrie . at his home near Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, in ‘a form of summary . justice’. The judge replied: . ‘If you burgle a house in the country where the householder owns a . legally held shotgun, that is the chance you take. You cannot come to . court and ask for a lighter sentence because of it.’ Mr . Grayling’s move follows changes made by his predecessor Ken Clarke, . which removed a legal requirement for householders to retreat. Guilty: Burglars Joshua O'Gorman , left, and Daniel Mansell, who had a string of previous convictions, were both jailed after they were shot after breaking into the home of Andy Ferrie in Welby, near Melton Mowbray . Guidance for police has also been changed to encourage fewer arrests of those defending their home. Mr Grayling will also introduce measures to make sure every community sentence contains a proper punishment. They . include a requirement to include a punitive element in every community . order, a power to impose location monitoring  and the removal of the . £5,000 cap on compensation in the magistrates courts . Mr . Grayling said: ‘We inherited a weak, “soft-option” programme from . Labour, which saw offenders working only minimal hours or simply not . completing their sentences. ‘Yes, we should rehabilitate. But criminals also need to receive a proper punishment.'VIDEO: David Cameron says people need to be able to defend themselves...","New laws could allow use of lethal force against criminals .

"Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has blasted the Obama administration for bringing the world to the brink of 'a second Cold War that nobody needs.' In a videotaped interview published Tuesday, he told Bloomberg Television that 'we are slowly but surely approaching a second cold war,' in part because President Barack Obama 'could be more tactful politically.' Seated at his private residence outside Moscow and speaking through an English translator, Medvedev blasted Obama for leveling sanctions at the Russian government and its wealthiest oligarchs. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev blasted the Obama administration -- with a smile! -- for bringing the world to the brink of 'a second Cold War that nobody needs' Nerves fraying: Russia claims it has withdrawn troops from near the Ukrainian border, but tank commanders at checkpoints are still standing guard . Naive? Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov pressed a red prop 'reset button' along with then- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in March 2009, but the two countries' relations are now at a post-Cold War low . 'Let's be . honest: Those sanctions are a sharp knife for European business,' he claimed. 'And . American business doesn't need them either. The only ones who want . sanctions are politicians, who use them to reinforce their convictions . and demonstrate their power.' And in a mafia-like jab, the Russian legislative leader hinted that if he wanted to, he could push back against U.S. sanctions. 'You've probably noticed that we have not commented on them a great deal or responded to them harshly,' he told Bloomberg reporter Ryan Chilcote, 'although we probably could cause some unpleasantries for the country that imposes those sanctions.' Asked about the now-infamous 'reset button' effort that he co-engineered with then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in March 2009, Medvedev said the Obama administration has unraveled any Russian good will that may have existed five years ago. 'Yes, I believe that President Obama could be more tactful politically when discussing those issues,' he said. 'Some decisions taken by the U.S. administration are disappointing.' Pressure: Russian President Vladimir Putin joined with Chinese President Xi Jinping (R) to oversee joint naval exercises on Tuesday as the two powers seek to build ties in the face of Western criticism and territorial disputes . Medvedev hinted at repercussions for U.S. economic sanctions, saying that 'we probably could cause some unpleasantries for the country that imposes those sanctions' 'We have indeed done a lot for Russian-U.S. relations. I believe doing so was right. The agreements that we reached with America were useful. And I'm very sorry that everything that has been achieved is now being eliminated by those [U.S.] decisions.' 'Basically,' he claimed, 'we are slowly but surely approaching a second Cold War that nobody needs. Why am I saying this? Because a competent politician knows how to make reserved, careful, subtle, wise and intelligent decisions –  which, I believe, Mr Obama succeeded at for a while.' 'But what is being done now, unfortunately, proves that the US Administration has run out of these resources. And the United States is one of the parties to suffer from this.' Medvedev's interview came as the U.S. was still seeking 'firm evidence' to support Russia's claim that it has withdrawn soldiers from the borders of Ukraine. Ukraine is gearing up for an election to replace former president Viktor Yanukovych, who fled to Russia in February after months of street protests. Russia's relations with the United States and European Union are at a post-Cold War low following Moscow's seizure of Crimea.","Dmitry Medvedev blasted Obama for not 'know[ing] how to make reserved, careful, subtle, wise and intelligent decisions'

"Munching on almonds can reduce a person's hunger without increasing their weight . Snacking has become something of a national pastime, with an estimated 97 per cent of people munching their way through at least one snack a day. While this habit may keep hunger at bay, it's fuelling an obesity epidemic. Now new American research may hold the answer -  munching on almonds can reduce hunger without increasing weight. Researchers at Purdue University, in Indiana, found that eating 1.5oz of dry-roasted, lightly salted almonds every day reduced volunteers’ hunger, improved their Vitamin E levels and ‘good’ fat intake, and did not cause them to pile on the pounds. 1.50z of almonds is equivalent to 43g or around 30 individual nuts. The researchers conducted a four-week trial to investigate the effects of eating almonds on weight and appetite. The study included 137 adults at increased risk of type 2 diabetes. The participants were divided into five groups - a control group that avoided all nuts and seeds, a group that ate 1.5oz of almonds at breakfast and one that ate the nuts at lunch. There was also a group that snacked on them in the morning, and one that ate them in the afternoon. The volunteers were not given any other rules other than to follow their usual eating patterns and physical activity. The results showed that even though they were eating approximately 250 calories a day in the form of the almonds, they did not eat any more calories overall. ‘This research suggests that almonds may be a good snack option, especially for those concerned about weight,’ said Dr Richard Mattes, professor of nutrition science at Purdue University and the study's lead author. ‘In this study, participants compensated for the additional calories provided by the almonds so daily energy intake did not rise. ‘They also reported reduced hunger levels and desire to eat at subsequent meals, particularly when almonds were consumed as a snack [as opposed to during a meal].’ Almonds have also previously been shown to increase the feeling of fullness in both normal weight, and overweight people. Snacking has become something of a national pastime with an estimated 97 per cent of people munching their way through at least one snack a day . This is thought to be due to almonds' monounsaturated fat, protein, and fibre content. Previous research has shown that eating almonds can cut a person's risk of liver cancer because of the nuts’ Vitamin E content. The Vitamin E in almonds is also thought to protect against heart disease and eye damage in old age. Another study suggested that eating almonds can help prevent diabetes because it can help improve insulin sensitivity and reduce cholesterol levels.","People who ate 1.5oz of almonds - equivalent to around 250 calories - didn't end up gaining weight or eating any more throughout the day .

"Two brothers have been jailed for a raft of sexual offences including pimping out young girls to workers at a curry house for £150 sex sessions. Ahdel Ali, 24, was sentenced to 18 years in prison, while his 29-year-old brother Mubarek was handed a 14-year-term by Judge Patrick Thomas QC at Worcester Crown Court. During the brothers' trial the court heard that the two men systematically groomed young girls for after hour sex sessions at the restaurant. Sentenced: Mubarek Ali, 29, left, and Ahdel Ali, 24, right, have been jailed for 32 years for pimping out young girls to curry house workers . The Ali brothers, both of Regent Street, Wellington, denied a total of 24 offences, including controlling child prostitution, people trafficking and sexual exploitation. Ahdel Ali, known as Eddie, was also accused of rape and sexual activity with a child. The abuse was committed against four girls between March 2008 and December 2009. Mubarek Ali denied four counts of controlling child prostitution, two of trafficking within the UK for sexual exploitation, and one of causing child prostitution between March 2008 and December 2009. His brother denied three charges of controlling child prostitution, 11 of sexual activity with a child, two of inciting child prostitution, one of meeting a child following sexual grooming, one of inciting a child to engage in sexual activity, and a count of rape alleged to have been committed between June and September 2008. 'We are satisfied with the sentences handed down at court today and are pleased these two men will now serve significant custodial sentences,' West Mercia Police detective chief inspector Neil Jamieson said. 'Ahdel Ali and Mubarek Ali targeted these girls because of their vulnerability and then systematically groomed them in such a way that eventually they could exploit them sexually for their own gain and gratification.' Guilty: Wheeler was found guilty of four counts of sexual activity with a child and one of sexual assault at Worcester Crown Court (pictured) Jamieson added that the trial had been an ordeal for the victims who gave evidence. 'I would like to pay tribute to the strength and character shown by all of the victims who came and gave evidence,' he said. 'It has been very challenging for these young women to come forward and give their evidence and I hope that these convictions will go some way to help them move on with their future lives. 'I would also like to thank my team of dedicated officers and staff who worked very hard to bring these men to justice.' During the trial, Stafford Crown Court heard the pair groomed two teenage girls for sex before persuading them to work as prostitutes for them four years ago. One of the victims, now aged 19, told the court she and her friend were driven to the Dhaka Tandoori restaurant in Wellington, Telford, Shropshire, after hours. The woman, giving evidence behind a screen, told the court: 'Two of the men took my friend into a bedroom. It was after the restaurant was closed and there were three men in rooms upstairs.' She said she went into one room where she found her friend having sex with one of the men. Another man asked her to have sex, she said, but she refused and instead performed a sex act on him. She told the court: 'I felt I had to do it. I didn’t want to do it.' When the girls left the restaurant they found the Ali brothers taking drugs and drinking in their car, the jury heard. The girl told the court: 'They were just laughing. They thought it was funny because we had to do it and they got money for it.' Earlier the court heard the girl met the brothers when she was 15. She said that they befriended her but when she turned 16 she was forced to have sex with men up to four times a week.","Mubarek and Ahdel Ali sentenced for grooming teenage girls for sex .

"A real estate developer who repeatedly sent in requests to buy a vacant lot next to some of his property was repeatedly denied or ignored by the city, he said. So Ori Feibush, who owns OCF Realty as well as OCF Coffee House, decided to take matters into his own hands, spending around $20,000 to clean highway dividers, weeds, and a decade’s worth of garbage. But the city of Philadelphia said that by cleaning the dilapidated lot, Mr Feibush was trespassing. To add insult to injury, the city said that Mr Feibush had to return the 1,600-square feet back to its original state. In hot water: Real Estate Developer Ori Feibush, pictured in his coffee shop in Philadelphia, has been asked by the city to return a vacant lot by his shop back to its original state . Before: Cement highway dividers, weeds, and rubbish filled the vacant lot, spilling onto the sidewalk . After: Mr Feibush and his crew spent four days ahead of his coffee shop's opening turning the lot into a usable, landscaped area . Speaking to MailOnline, Mr Feibush said it was never his intention to spend so much time and money on fixing up the lot – he had wanted to buy it. ‘That particular lot has had importance to me for many reasons,’ he explained. ‘It’s directly adjacent to a coffee shop we just opened. 'I contacted the city six years ago, and again four years ago in earnest to try and purchase it. It never came into fruition from one bureaucratic reason or another.’ He said that after numerous calls to the Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority – each more earnest than the next –things were getting desperate in his attempts to own the lot in the Point Breeze neighbourhood of the city. His coffee house was slated to open on August 16, with one problem – the eyesore next to his new business. ‘You have the three-foot high highway barriers, then you have heavy cement and tiles, then debris from the past decade, it hadn’t been touched in years by the city,’ he said. ‘It was in complete disrepair. Thousands of broken needles, and condoms, it was spilling over the highway barriers. This was literally where people were throwing their garbage.’ He said as a last ditch effort, he called the PRA to have them clean the lot ahead of his coffee shop’s opening. Trashy: The lot was overrun with bottles, needles, concrete, and other undesirable items . Long haul: Feibush and his team rented construction equipment to clear what they estimated was 40 tonnes of rubbish . Layered look: The team laid down mulch and a tarp to prevent weeds from sprouting back up . Mr Feibush called every day, with officials telling him they’d send someone out soon. Then, he said, they sent a small Caterpillar machine to deal with the 40 tonnes of debris. ‘It’s like showing up to a stadium and expecting to clean it with a shovel,’ the realtor said. ‘It was such a token effort that we said forget it.’ From there, he and his crew hired some heavy-duty equipment, moving the cement barriers back from the sidewalk, putting down a tarp to stop weeds from growing, and laying down irrigation systems. In total, Mr Feibush estimated that he spent anywhere from $20,000 to $30,000 on improvements. 'This is not something I had any . interest in doing. I expected a thank you, I didn't expect the reaction . to be what it was, go find 40 tonnes of trash and put it back.' -Real estate developer Ori Feibush . But, he said, the finished product was well worth it. ‘We made (the lot) what it should have always been,’ he said. But according to Paul Chrystie, who works as the director of communications for Philadelphia’s Office of Housing and Community Development, the barriers were there for the safety of residents, and also to prevent people from dumping their trash. He told ABC News that the property was not ignored, though it could have used a little work. He said in a statement: ‘There are hundreds of agreements in Philadelphia allowing private citizens to use public lots. ‘Mr Feibush chose not to pursue one, which is not fair to the taxpayers who are foregoing revenue and accepting liability, nor to three potential buyers who have followed the rules that Mr Feibush is ignoring.’ The real estate developer told MailOnline that the block is in much better shape than it’s been in years. ‘It took us four days just to remove the trash,’ he said. Hard day's night: Workers look at the progress of the 1,600 square-foot lot . Where the sidewalk ends: OCF even laid down a new, wider sidewalk, uninhibited by cement dividers, weeds, and garbage . Finished product: The area, complete with landscaping, candles, and children, has become a welcome respite from Philadelphia's heat . ‘This is not something I had any interest in doing. I expected a thank you, I didn’t expect the reaction to be what it was, go find 40 tonnes of trash and put it back.’ He estimated that it would cost between $70,000 and $80,000 to purchase the lot from the city, and at this point, he said, ‘I would pay it just to keep it a garden. 'I would gladly pay if there was fair market value. The real shame is that they claim I never expressed interest, but I and probably others as well were turned down. ‘It’s as if they want their city to remain blighted.’","Real estate developer Ori Feibush tried for years to buy vacant lot in Point Breeze neighbourhood of Philadelphia from the city .

"Success treatment: The 'mini-IVF' has had twice the success rates as the conventional method . A half-price version of IVF that women could have in their lunch-hour has been shown to raise the chances of having a baby drastically. It is particularly effective for those in their late 30s and early 40s and success rates are almost twice as high as the conventional fertility treatment. The technique involves using far lower doses of drugs, with the result that it is not only far cheaper, but also has virtually no side effects. Many women undergoing normal IVF suffer from mood swings, nausea and headaches. In rare cases it can cause a life-threatening condition whereby their abdomen fills with fluid. This new method, known as mini-IVF, involves giving women a daily pill for ten to 12 days which contains a low dose of the fertility drug clomid. This encourages their ovaries to produce eggs and during this time the women undergo ultrasound scans every few days to check the eggs are developing healthily. Once the eggs are large enough – around another ten days later – they are removed during a five-minute operation. This means women can have it done before work, or during their lunch break, unlike normal IVF which lasts half a day and requires them to be put to sleep. Doctors from St Louis, Missouri, who developed the method say it should be routinely offered to all women as it is cheaper, safer and a far more effective alternative. Trials involving 520 women unveiled at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine conference in Boston showed that success rates for women over 35 were a third higher compared with those undergoing conventional IVF. The results were even better among the over-40s – those using this new method were twice as likely to have a baby compared to if they had used the conventional  fertility treatment. Dr Sherman Silber, a fertility expert who helped develop the method, said it was so effective it offered women in their 40s the same chance of falling pregnant as those in their twenties. Too good to be true? The new IVF treatment is particularly effective for those in their late 30s and early 40s, using far lower doses of drugs, and also has virtually no side effects . In women aged 35 or below, success rates are about the same as standard IVF but the researchers say they would also benefit from using it because it is far cheaper and has fewer side effects. Dr Silber said: ‘This is perfect for Britain and it would save an incredible amount of money. This is the magic solution.’ A course of mini-IVF costs between £1,200 and £1,800 compared with standard IVF which is between £3,000 and £4,000. The reason it is so much cheaper is that it involves using far lower doses of the fertility drug clomid. But this also makes it safer as large amounts of medication can lead to the deadly condition ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome whereby their abdomens fill with fluid – this occurs in 1 per cent of women having IVF. One of main reasons women in their late 30s and early 40s have problems conceiving either naturally or with IVF is that they do not produce enough healthy eggs, capable of developing into an embryo and eventually a foetus. In fact, the high dose fertility drugs used in conventional IVF worsen this problem as although they make a woman produce more eggs, they also appear to result in changes in the DNA of the eggs which make them defective. But mini-IVF only uses very low doses of the drugs that do not make the woman’s eggs less healthy. Professor Geeta Nargund, a  consultant gynaecologist at the London fertility clinic Create said: ‘This study is a valuable addition to the growing evidence that mild stimulation IVF needs to become the first choice in IVF clinics for many women.’","New IVF treatment particularly effective for those aged 35-45 .

"Rocketing global rates of stroke among the young and middle-aged are a ‘wake-up call’, say British experts. In the past 20 years the number of strokes afflicting people aged 20 to 64 have jumped by a quarter, an international study shows. Strokes in this age group now make up 31 per cent of the worldwide total, compared with 25 per cent before 1990. Warning: The number of strokes in the past 20 years have jumped by a quarter . Although the rate of strokes among older people is declining in the UK, Britons are still more likely to die from stroke than someone living in France, Germany and the US. In the poorest areas of the UK the number of people dying from stroke is around three times higher than in the least economically deprived. Jon Barrick, chief executive of the Stroke Association, called the study a ‘wake-up call to governments across the globe’. Poor lifestyles, increasing sedentary habits, obesity and diabetes threatened to eradicate advances made in Britain in recent years, he warned. Figures from King’s College London earlier this month revealed a 40 per cent fall in stroke rates among  elderly people since the mid-1990s. Experts said the drop was due to better treatment of high blood  pressure and cholesterol. But rates remain high for people aged 45 and under, and those of black Caribbean and African origin, and a drop in the total number of strokes is unlikely because more people are  living longer. The latest findings, published in The Lancet medical journal, form part of the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010, looking at major diseases and causes of ill health in 50 countries. The results reveal stark differences between rich and poor. Relentless: BBC presenter Andrew Marr, 54, suffered a stroke, which he blamed on his relentless schedule . Strokes were linked to 46 per cent more disability and illness and 42 per cent more deaths in poorer countries than in richer ones between 1990 and 2010. In rich countries, stroke rates fell 12 per cent over the two decades. Lifestyle factors such as smoking, high blood pressure and unhealthy diet were thought to play a role in increasing stroke rates in low-to-middle income countries. Professor Valery Feigin of New  Zealand’s National Institute for Stroke and Applied Neurosciences said: ‘The worldwide stroke burden is growing very fast and there is now an urgent need for culturally acceptable and affordable stroke prevention, management and rehabilitation strategies to be developed and implemented worldwide.’ Each year around 152,000 strokes occur in the UK, costing the NHS an estimated £3.7billion, and there are over a million Britons living with the effects of stroke. In January, BBC presenter Andrew Marr, 54, suffered a stroke, which he blamed on his relentless schedule. Mr Barrick said at least half of strokes could be prevented by simple lifestyle changes, such as taking more exercise. ‘The report reveals a shocking disparity between rich and poor, where death rates from stroke are up to ten times higher in lower income countries,’ he said. ‘Closer to home, within the UK, the number of people dying from stroke is around three times higher in the most economically deprived areas, compared to the least deprived. ‘Stroke survivors often face a black hole when discharged from hospital, with one in five in the UK receiving no support from services to help them recover. ‘This is a stark warning. We urgently need to address this global stroke crisis by prioritising stroke prevention and investment into stroke research.’ A second study published in The Lancet Global Health showed that in 2010, three-fifths of the global disability and more than half of deaths due to stroke were from bleeding in the brain. This type of stroke, known as a haemorrhagic stroke, is deadlier than more common ischaemic strokes that cut blood supply to the brain.","People aged 20 to 64 suffering strokes jumped by a quarter .

"Residents on a housing estate have been left facing a two-mile detour to get home after a council installed a 10-metre bus lane next to a junction. People living on Wixams estate, outside Bedford, now have to drive along the busy A6 to avoid the 32ft lane that is used by just two buses an hour at peak time. Nearly 300 drivers been fined since the road was fitted with cameras and marked ‘Bus Only’ two weeks ago. Up to here: The bus lane cuts off the access to Wixams housing estate in Bedford, leaving residents forced to make a two-mile detour on the A6 . The lane has been created in the middle of Kingsway road cutting off the access to the estate. The restriction, which is controlled by cameras, ends after just ten metres (32ft 9in) and the road continues with an ordinary width. People living nearby say the lane is nothing more than a money-making scam by Bedford Borough Council which has fined 284 drivers in the past two weeks. Katie Baughan, 32, was hit with a £50 fine for driving through the bus lane last week. She said: 'It's nonsense and completely pointless, you can drive either side of this red strip but not through it without getting a ticket.' Re-routing: The short cut,marked with blue dots, show the location of the bus lane, with the de-tour is marked in red . Long drive: Almost 300 motorists have been slapped with fines since the 32ft long 'Bus Only' lane was created two weeks ago . Ms Baughan added: ‘There are signs saying 'bus only' directly as you come up to it but not as you are coming off the A6 roundabout. ‘It is completely ridiculous to have such a short bus lane.’ Marie . Jepps, 68, whose husband David was fined, said: ‘It is ludicrous. I . think it is just another way to get money out of people. ‘We always go that way to go to the shop or garden centre because it makes sense.’ Local anger: Marie Jepps, 68, who got a £60 fine after driving down the bus lane on Kingsway leading to the Wixams housing estate . Well guarded: Several residents on Wixams estate have been given £50 fines after being caught on cameras used to police the short bit of road . There are no time restrictions on the lane which means residents are forced to make their detour around it even when it is not being used at night. Mark O'Leary, 26, has been a resident on Wixams estate for 2.5 years and says that although the lane has been narrow for the duration of his residency, the cameras have shortened fuses in the area. 'It has always been a bus lane, the only new addition is the actual camera which has gone up in the past few months and the camera sign which has been there for a couple of days. 'I do agree that there are no signs either end of the ""shortcut"" road highlighting there is no access for vehicles other than buses.' Tough fines: Bedfordshire Borough Council have been accused of creating the bus lane as a way to 'scam' residents on the housing estate . Despite the protests, Bedford Borough Council defended its decision to introduce the lane. A spokesman said: ‘We took on the responsibility for the enforcement of bus lanes last April. 'At that time, the council made it clear it would enforce the correct use of bus lanes to ensure the safety of our roads, ease congestion, improve bus punctuality and keep the lanes clear for emergency vehicles. 'All lanes are clearly sign-posted and include clear markings on the road itself. 'There is no excuse for not realising you are driving illegally in a bus lane and it is right that we will take action to keep our roads safe for the majority of road users.’","Bus lane created on access road to housing estate in Bedford .

"The widow of a TV executive who was killed in a speedboat crash has had her leg amputated below the knee, it emerged today. Nick and Victoria Milligan were on a Bank Holiday weekend away in Padstow, Cornwall with their four children when their boat ran out of control, throwing them into the water and running them over with its propellor. A report into the accident found that the boat's 'kill cord' was not attached to the driver, possibly costing the lives of Sky TV boss Mr Milligan, 51, and his eight-year-old daughter Emily. Mrs Milligan, 39, and the couple's four-year-old son both suffered 'life-changing injuries' in the accident, and the family has now confirmed that the former yoga teacher has lost her leg. Scroll down for video . Horror: Nick Milligan and daughter Emily, far left, were killed in a Bank Holiday accident and the rest of the family were badly injured . The two other children, Amber, 12, and Olivia, 10, escaped with . minor injuries after eyewitness Charlie Toogood jumped on to the . boat and cut the engine. A family statement said: 'All family . members have now left Derriford Hospital. Amber and Olivia have been . discharged while Victoria and Kit have been transferred to a London . hospital. 'Victoria's left leg has been amputated below the knee. Kit is responding well to treatment but both require further surgery. 'We are grateful for the continued support of our family and friends and the good wishes we have received from the public.' An interim report into the May 4 accident today revealed the engine could have been switched off sooner if a kill cord had been used. It is supposed to be attached to the skipper's leg so it yanks out the ignition key and cuts the throttle if the helmsman is thrown from the craft. Amputation: Victoria Milligan has lost her leg after suffering 'life-changing injuries' in the accident . The . safety body have not said who was driving the boat but confirmed the . vessel's kill cord was not attached to whoever was at the helm. The . Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) said at this stage it was . 'not clear' how the family came to be thrown off their rigid hulled . inflatable boat (RHIB). A report said: 'The unmanned RHIB . subsequently executed a series of tight high speed turns, running over . members of the family in the water, causing two fatalities and serious . injuries to two people. 'At this early stage in the . investigation, the mechanism that led to the family being ejected from . the RHIB into the water, is not clear. 'The RHIB was fitted with a kill cord but this was not attached to the driver at the time of the accident. 'Consequently, . when the driver was ejected from the boat, the kill cord did not . operate to stop the engine and the RHIB continued to circle out of . control, and at speed. 'As . the RHIB circled, it ran over the family in the water a number of times, . leading to the deaths and injuries. A few minutes later a local boatman . was able to board the RHIB and bring it under control before further . people were hurt.' Incident: This still from a video shows the out-of-control speedboat circling the bay after ejecting the passengers . The family, from Wandsworth, south west London, were on holiday in the coastal town when they were thrown from the boat . The MAIB's interim findings were published in the form of a safety bulletin, issued by Steve Clinch, Chief Inspector of Marine Accidents. The document urged speedboat users to use kill cords at all times and to test them regularly to see if they work. A full report into the accident is yet to be published. The bulletin said: 'The kill cord serves only one purpose, to stop the engine when the driver moves away from the controls. 'To . ensure that this tragic accident is not repeated it is essential that . all owners and operators of vessels are fitted with kill cords. 'Test . them regularly to ensure that the engine stops when the kill cord . mechanism is operated. Make sure that the cord is in good condition. 'Always . attach the cord securely to the driver, ideally before the engine is . started, but certainly before the boat is put in gear. 'Stop the engine before transferring the kill cord to another driver.' Investigators said at this stage it was 'not clear' how the family came to be thrown off their rigid hulled inflatable boat . The family of six were flung into the water as their 300-horsepower Cobra boat spun out of control in the Camel Estuary half a mile from land. Holidaymakers watched in horror as the empty craft raced round in circles, its propellers slashing the helpless victims and turning the water 'red with blood'. Mrs Milligan is thought to have had one of her legs amputated below the knee but doctors were able to save Kit's badly mangled leg. The family, from Wandsworth, south-west London, own a 'dream home' in Trebetherick, which is on the other side of the estuary from Padstow.","Victoria Mulligan, 39, loses her leg two weeks after accident .

"It's usually invisible to the naked eye, but Nasa’s latest ultra-high-resolution computer model shows plumes of carbon dioxide swirling and shifting across the globe. The visualisation provides a fascinating look at how gases in the atmosphere build up, and travel over the course of a year. In the video, a year of data is compressed into just over three minutes, revealing concentrations dipping during the spring, and peaking when winter hits. Scroll down for video . The visualisation (pictured) was created by scientists at Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Centre’s Global Modeling and Assimilation Office. It shows the differences between carbon dioxide levels in the northern and southern hemispheres. Colours represent the concentration of carbon dioxide, from dark blue to pink . It was produced by a model called GEOS-5, created by scientists at Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Centre’s Global Modeling and Assimilation Office. The simulation also shows the differences between carbon dioxide levels in the northern and southern hemispheres, plus distinct swings in global carbon dioxide concentrations as plants and trees grow and change with the seasons. The visualisation was created using a simulation called a Nature Run. The Nature Run uses data on atmospheric conditions and the emission of greenhouse gases, from both natural and man-made sources. They may only be tiny, and live for just three months, but ants could be the key to solving climate change. Rough harvester ants have been found to ‘weather’ minerals in sand to produce calcium carbonate, also known as limestone. When the ants make this limestone, the process traps carbon dioxide in the rock, ultimately removing it from the atmosphere. It is unsure how the minerals are converted, however, and theories range from ants licking the sand, to excreting the substance. The discovery was made by Professor Ronald Dorn from the University of Arizona Tempe. The model is then left to run on its own and simulate the natural behaviour of the Earth’s atmosphere. This particular Nature Run simulates January 2006 to December 2006. Goddard scientists have been working with a beta version of the Nature Run for several years, but recently released an updated, improved version for the first time. The colours represent the concentration of carbon dioxide, from dark blue to pink - ranging from 377 to 395 parts per million. Red represents around 385 parts per million, and plumes shown on the greyscale are carbon monoxide emissions. The video is narrated by Nasa climate scientists Bill Putman. ‘Carbon dioxide is the most important greenhouse gas affected by human activity,’ explained Mr Putman. ‘About half of the carbon dioxide emitted by fuel combustion remains in the atmosphere, while the other half is absorbed by natural land and ocean reservoirs. ‘In the northern hemisphere, we see the highest concentrations are focused around emission sources over Northern America, Europe and Asia. In the northern hemisphere, the highest concentrations of gas are focused around emission sources over Northern America, Europe and Asia. During spring and summer, plants absorb carbon dioxide. This removes some of the gas, and the model changes from red and purple to green and yellow (pictured) ‘Notice how the gas doesn’t stay in one place, the dispersion of carbon dioxide is controlled by the large-scale weather patterns within the global circulation.’ During spring and summer in the northern hemisphere, plants absorb a substantial amount of carbon dioxide through photosynthesis. This removes some of the gas from the atmosphere, and the model is seen changing from red and purple to green, yellow and blue. During this time, carbon monoxide (pictured in grey) is released in the southern hemisphere, and during the summer, plumes of the harmful gas are released from fires in Africa and Australia. These emissions are moved around the globe by the wind. As plants die during autumn, carbon dioxide levels begin to rise again . Meanwhile,carbon monoxide is seen being released in the southern hemisphere, and during the summer, plumes of the harmful gas are released from fires in Africa and Australia. These emissions are then moved around the globe by the wind. As plants die during autumn and winter, carbon dioxide levels begin to rise again. ‘Although this change is expected, we’re seeing higher levels of carbon dioxide accumulate in the atmosphere each year. ‘This is contributing to the long-term trend of rising global temperatures,’ concluded Mr Putman.","The visualisation was created using a simulation called a Nature Run .

"A pregnant Base jumper has died in what she had pledged would be her final leap before retiring. Wioletta Roslan, of Sweden, had said she would give up the high-risk sport after falling pregnant, but decided to make one last jump near Stechelberg, Switzerland, which ended in tragedy. The 37-year-old adrenaline junkie was four months pregnant when she died after her parachute failed to open during a Base (Buildings, Antennas, Spans and Earth) jump last weekend. Tragedy: Wioletta Roslan died aged 37 after her parachute failed to open during a Base jump in Switzerland . Her boyfriend Aleksander Domalewski jumped alongside her and could do nothing but watch as she realised her parachute wouldn’t open and spread her arms awaiting the impact of the 990ft drop. The Via Ferrata cliff was Miss Roslan’s favourite spot for Base jumping and she had been there many times before with her partner. She was experienced in extreme sports after taking up skydiving as a 19-year-old in Malmo, Sweden. Her mother Halina Zaniewska-Pettersson, 68, said: ‘I was always terrified every time I knew that she was doing the sport again and I kept expecting the worst. 'When she said that she was going to do one last jump while pregnant I begged her not to go. Accident: Pregnant Ms Roslan, who had announced that this was going to be her final jump before retiring, died instantly after freefalling 990ft . ‘But she always wanted to carry on. I couldn't force not to do it – she was old enough to make up her own mind about things.’ Miss Roslan . had managed to build a successful career as an inspector working on oil . rigs – and in her spare time travelled the world as a professional Base . jumper. 'I only feel alive when I jump. I find normal life boring. I know that death always flies with me but we only have a certain amount of time on the earth. When the sun goes down then it's game over whoever you are' Wioletta Roslan . She said in a recent interview for . Swiss television that Base jumping made her feel alive and as if  there . were no limits in life. Miss Roslan said: . ‘I only feel alive when I jump. I find normal life boring. I know that . death always flies with me but we only have a certain amount of time on . the earth. When the sun goes down then it's game over whoever you are.’ She had lived in the Berner Oberland region for two years doing odd jobs in order to spend every spare moment jumping from local cliffs. She told her mother it had been the . happiest time in her life and she wanted to go for a final jump with her . boyfriend before retiring. Adrenaline junkie: Wioletta Roslan, pictured during a wingwalk, had recently moved to Berner Oberland and spent all her spare time and money on extreme sport . Parachute failure: The tragic accident happened off a cliff near Stechelberg in Switzerland (file picture) After three people made successful jumps, Miss Roslan and her boyfriend stepped up to the edge. Ms Zaniewska-Pettersson said: ‘Aleksander jumped at the same time as her and could only watch what happened. He told me that she desperately tried to get her parachute to open without success. 'I was always terrified every time I knew that she was doing the sport again and I kept expecting the worst – when she said that she was going to do one last jump while pregnant I begged her not to go' Halina Zaniewska-Pettersson, mother . 'It did not open and in the last moment she realised she was not going to succeed. He told me that she had simply spread her arms and waited for the impact.’ Miss Roslan died instantly. Local emergency doctor Bruno Durrer said: ‘Every death in the mountains is tragic but this one was particularly so because I knew her and also because she was pregnant.’ Ms Zaniewska-Pettersson said: ‘I am totally devastated and shocked. I picked so often to give up jumping but she just didn't listen and now it's too late. 'When she was in Switzerland she was only there for Base jumping – every spare moment she was climbing and jumping. Her death is the fifth in connection with Base jumping in the Berner Oberland region this year. Ms Zaniewska-Pettersson said: ‘All that is left for me now memories but my daughter lived her life to the full – she was a true adventurer travel to France and Italy, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand and America to do with her sport.

"An Australian cricket announcer has been sacked on the spot after using an Indian accent to pronounce the name of Engand spinner Monty Panesar. David Nixon was fired from his match-day duties by Cricket Australia after his announcement in England's tour match at Traeger Park. He appeared to mock the cricketer, who plays for Essex, and was relieved of his duties after lunch on the second and final day. There were reports that he used an Indian accent when announcing the name of England bowler Monty Panesar, but CA would not comment on the specifics of the dismissal. Sacked David Nixon took to Twitter to say England's Monty Panesar was a cult hero and he 'loved' him . Target: A public announcer was sacked for making what appeared to be a racial slur at Monty Panesar . A spokesman for the Australian board . did nonetheless say on Saturday afternoon: 'Cricket Australia deemed the . conduct of the PA announcer as inappropriate and as such he will take . no further part in the match.' 'There will be no further comment from CA until a review of events has been completed.' But Nixon took to his Twitter account to explain that his 'style' did not work with the broadcaster.He wrote: 'Really? I love Monty P - cult hero. He should bat 3. My style didn't fit theirs. That's all.' Nixon, . an Austalian Broadcasting Corporation employee, undertook the PA job . separately in the tourists' fixture against a CA Chairman XI. He was already on a warning after being told off on the first day for making a sarcastic comment over the tannoy when Joe Root was out, along the lines of ‘Now you can go and have a drink Joe.' Panesar picked up three wickets for England as they drew their tour match in Alice Springs. Ian Bell, leading England in Alice Springs in the absence of the rested Alastair Cook, appeared mystified by the turn of events. Caught: Joe Root, who was out for one in the second innings, was also a target of David Nixon . Scene: England drew their tour match against the Cricket Australia Chairman's XI in Alice Springs . The England and Wales Cricket Board made no complaint about Nixon, and was unaware of his sacking until told by the hosts. At his post-match press conference, Bell said: 'We weren't aware of it, didn't know anything about it. 'Until now ... I don't think any of the team were. We were focused on the cricket. 'You could hear him through the game, but hadn't heard he'd been sacked.' The . controversy over Nixon's performance comes against an antagonistic . backdrop so far in this winter's Ashes, which has included an outbreak . of 'sledging' in England's first-Test defeat at the Gabba last week and a . frosty, partisan reception for the tourists from media and home crowds . alike. Fellow spinner Graeme Swann also claimed four wickets, but fast bowlers Steven Finn and Boyd Rankin both struggled in the sweltering heat. England head to Adelaide for the second Ashes Test, which begins on Thursday, looking to bounce back from their massive defeat in Brisbane. The Test was overshadowed by some heated verbal exchanges, most notably when Australian captain Michael Clarke confronted Jimmy Anderson.","David Nixon was fired from his match-day duties after his announcement .

"A police officer was caught off guard on Monday night when a drug search led to a close encounter with a metre-long snake. Senior Constable Christopher Knott stopped a cyclist who was riding without a helmet or safety lights at Seaford, south-east of Melbourne, just before midnight. After a conversation with the cyclist, Officer Knott found himself searching through the 32-year-old's backpack. Senior Constable Christopher Knott found the metre-long python after stopping a cyclist who was riding without safety gear . 'I found a little bit of methamphetamine and cannabis and, when I delved deeper, I found a snake,' he told Triple M. Not particularly fond of snakes, the officer admitted that he jumped back when his fingers touched the metre long West Australian python. 'I touched it and I thought it was like one of those toy ones – one of the plastic or rubbery things that people throw around,' Constable Knott said. 'When I touched it and it just moved about an inch - that's when I realised it was a snake.' He said he first mistook the snake for a rubber toy when searching the cyclist's backpack for drugs . Officer Knott said he had a stern conversation with the cyclist regarding the reptilian surprise, before taking him into custody and charging him with drug offences. The rider told the officers that he had forgot to warn them about the reptile as he was 'too concerned' with what else they were finding. The python, who he claimed he had a permit for, was a household pet that he couldn't bear to leave behind while he spent a few days in the CBD.

"A social media campaign has been launched calling for the sacking of Sky News reporter Martin Brunt, who tracked down and interviewed a woman who allegedly trolled the McCann family - and then killed herself a few days later. Brenda Leyland, 63, died at a Marriott hotel on Saturday around 15 miles from her immaculately kept village home in Leicestershire. Police said the death was not being treated as suspicious. A statement on the 'Sack Martin Brunt' Facebook page, set up yesterday, said: 'Martin Brunt should be sacked. RIP Brenda Leyland.' So far 1,265 people have liked the page. Interview: This is the moment Martin Brunt asked Mrs Leyland about her tweets about the McCanns and she said she was 'entitled' to an opinion . Anger: Many on the Facebook page feel the interview was intrusive of Mrs Leyland's privacy . As well as messages of sympathy and support, there have also been a number of posts criticising the McCann family, whose daughter Maddie went missing on holiday in Portugal in 2007. Earlier today her son gave an emotional tribute after she was found dead. Ben, 20, a musician who is said to be studying law in Los Angeles, posted the following brief tribute: 'I love you mum and I will miss you forever'. Martin Brunt denies he 'stalked' or 'chased' Mrs Leyland . He added: 'I am love and I am light, thanks to you'. Divorcee Mrs Leyland had been identified as one of a number of online 'trolls' posting a series of abusive comments about Kate and Gerry McCann, by Sky News crime correspondent Martin Brunt last Thursday. She told the reporter who confronted her that she had been 'entitled' to make the comments using her Twitter identity @Sweepyface. His mother's death came just days after she was exposed as being one of the people behind an online campaign against the couple. She was tracked down to her house and confronted about her online activities. Last night, neighbours of Mrs Leyland, who had continued using her married name, told of their shock at her death. One said: 'Brenda kept herself very much to herself, but people were surprised when she was accused of trolling the McCanns. You don't expect something that like around here. It's a very quiet place. 'But the village will be shocked by this news. I'm sure no-one would have expected her to do something like this. People didn't condone what she is said to have done, but it is obviously very sad when anybody is found dead.' Interview: Sky News spoke to Mrs Leyland about her Twitter activity and she disappeared a day after it was broadcast . Tribute: Ben Leyland, the son of alleged Twitter troll Brenda Leyland, has today paid tribute to his mother after she was found dead in a hotel room . Burton Overy was mentioned in the Domesday Book and is just 15 miles from the McCanns' home in Rothley, Leicestershire. Mrs Leyland, who was educated at a convent school and studied at Goldsmiths, University of London, is among a group of hate-filled critics of Kate and Gerry McCann who have posted hundreds of vile messages about the couple online. Brenda Leyland, 63, was identified as one of the people posting online hate messages aimed at the McCanns. Above, Mrs Leyland pictured this week before her death . The trolls wrongly believe the McCanns were involved in their daughter's disappearance. Among the many comments attributed to Mrs Leyland on Twitter was one that said: 'Q 'how long must the Mccanns suffer' answer 'for the rest of their miserable lives'.' On Friday, the day after her interview was broadcast, she disappeared from her home Leicestershire, neighbours said. Sky News said today in a statement: 'We were saddened to hear of the death of Brenda Leyland. It would be inappropriate to speculate or comment further at this time.' There was no answer at Mrs Leyland's white-fronted cottage home in Burton Overy today and the curtains were drawn. Dean Randall, landlord of the nearby  Bell Inn, said: 'She wasn't a regular at the pub but popped in for the occasional meal. 'She was a perfectly pleasant person who socialised with friends she had in the village. She appeared to be very well-liked'. Commenting on her online activities, Mr Randall added: 'What she tweeted was absolutely wrong. 'There should definitely be laws against that sort of thing. She has now paid a terrible price for what she did. 'Although she appeared to have a busy life, no-one in the pub ever mentioned her having a keen interest in computers and tweeting, but obviously she did. 'My locals are absolutely shocked by what has happened. No-one is blaming the media, they have a job to do reporting the news, and she had admitted sending those tweets.' Neighbours in the close-knit village of 280 residents were reluctant to discuss the tragedy, but one, who asked not to be named, said: 'Brenda took pride in her appearance and always liked to dress well. 'She was a very keen gardener and always looked after her home. She also took part in a local scarecrow festival. 'Everyone in the village knew that she had been on Sky TV and we knew she had suddenly left her home. There were concerns about what she might do but no-one thought she would go this far.' Last week the father of Madeleine McCann called for an example to be made of 'vile' internet trolls who have been targeting the family. Gerry McCann said he had 'grave concerns' about letting his nine-year-old twins use the internet after threats of violence and kidnapping. The comments, in an interview with the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, came after it emerged that police are looking at a dossier of abuse posted on Twitter, Facebook and chat forums. Mr McCann, whose daughter Madeleine went missing in Praia da Luz in 2007, said he and wife Kate did not read such material because it was too 'upsetting'. Mr McCann said. 'Clearly something needs to be done about the abuse on the internet. I'm glad to say that there have been a number of people where police have taken action. 'I think we probably need more people charged.' On Saturday Mrs Leyland was found dead at the Leicester Marriott Hotel, pictured, around 15 miles from her home . Scotland Yard is currently investigating the posting online of hundreds of hate messages aimed at the McCanns, both aged 46, whose daughter disappeared during a family holiday to Praia da Luz, Portugal, in 2007 . Asked about '@sweepyface', Mr McCann said: 'I haven't read her tweets ... I think that is an issue, that our behaviour is modified by this. 'We do not have any significant presence on social media or online. And I've got grave concerns about our children as they grow up and start to access the internet in an unsupervised capacity. 'There have been other instances where people are threatening to kidnap our children. People are threatening violence against Kate and myself. 'Of course it's not just us - it is many other people who happen to find themselves in rather tragic circumstances. 'I'm glad to see the law around this area is being reviewed. But I do think we need to make examples of people who are causing damage.' The troll investigation featured in numerous newspapers including The Guardian, The Independent, The Sun, The Daily Telegraph, The Times, The Daily Star, The Daily Express as well as the Daily Mail after Sky News exposed her identity as one of the trolls who targeted the McCanns.

A Leicestershire Police spokeswoman said: 'Officers were called at 1.42pm on Saturday October 4 following a report of Brenda Leyland being found deceased at a hotel room in Smith Way, Grove Park. 'Ms Leyland’s death is not being treated as suspicious and a file is being prepared for the Coroner. Officers acting on behalf of the Coroner will look into the circumstances surrounding and prior to her unexpected death'. McCann spokesman Clarence Mitchell said: 'Kate and Gerry will not be saying anything. It is entirely a matter for the police.' A spokesman for the Marriott hotel said he had nothing to add beyond the police statement. Scotland Yard is currently investigating the posting online of hundreds of hate messages aimed at the McCanns. Brenda Leyland's body was found in the Marriott Hotel in Leicestershire - around 15 miles from her home and from the McCanns' home . Using the Twitter handle @sweepyface, Mrs Leyland posted dozens of messages attacking the McCann family . Detectives have decided to act after being given a dossier from McCann family supporters which catalogues the abusive remarks - including death threats - aimed at the couple on Twitter, Facebook and online forums. A Metropolitan Police spokesman last week confirmed officers were assessing the contents of 'documentation' which has been passed to officers and were consulting with the Crown Prosecution Service and the McCanns. Last night, a spokesman for Marriott Hotels International Ltd said: 'We are very sad to confirm the death of a guest at the Leicester Marriott Hotel and our thoughts go out to the family and friends of the deceased. As this is a police matter and an investigation is underway, we are unable to comment further and enquiries should be directed to the police.'

"Accused murderer Gable Tostee has left a Brisbane prison on bail three months after he was arrested for the alleged murder of Warriena Wright in Surfers Paradise. Gable Tostee has arrived at the family home at Carrara, west of Surfers Paradise, where he will spend at least the next 14 months on bail awaiting trial. Wearing a white t-shirt, black shorts and thongs was, a clean-shaven Tostee, 28, was seen leaving prison on Wednesday afternoon after he was granted bail. He followed his mother, Helene, to the car park of the Arthur Gorrie Correctional Centre at Wacol in far western Brisbane at 5.25pm local time. Tostee was carrying belongings in a large cardboard box marked ' fresh farm eggs'. Mrs Tostee shielded her face from waiting media. Scroll down for video .

Accused murderer Gable Tostee has walked from a Brisbane prison on bail three months after he was arrested for alleged murder of Warriena Wright . Tostee (left) left prison with his mother Helene (right) and will remain in his parents' Gold Coast home under strict parole conditions . Tragic death: Warriena Wright (pictured) fell to her death from the 14th floor of Gable Tostee's Surfers Paradise apartment in the early hours of August 8 this year, just days before the 26-year-old was due to return home to New Zealand . His father, Burleigh Heads carpet salesman Gray Tostee, waited for two hours in the prison car park during a giant thunderstorm to collect his son as correctional authorities signed off on Gable's bail papers. Helene and Gray Tostee, who attended both days of their son's bail hearing in the Brisbane Supreme Court on Tuesday and Wednesday, picked up some items from a store while waiting for the paperwork to be finalised for Gable's release. The couple will drive their son to the family's Carrara house, where he will live under strict bail conditions and under a nightly curfew before his trial for alleged murder, not expected to begin until 2016. Mr and Mrs Tostee, who  were in the Brisbane Supreme Court  for the decision earlier today, have put up a $200,000 surety to reduce the flight risk of their 28-year-old son.

Tinder date: Gable Tostee (pictured) says he did not murder Warriena Wright,following their meeting via the mobile dating app Tinder in Cavill Mall, Surfers Paradise, then on to his nearby high rise apartment . Tostee will also be subject to random breath tests to ensure he adheres to the bail condition that he not drink alcohol. Granting Tostee bail, Justice Debra Mullins said the strict conditions imposed on him would reduce the risk of him fleeing. They included an alcohol ban, treatment for alcohol abuse, random breath testing and abstinence from not only Tinder, but all social media to try to meet up with women. ‘I am satisfied the applicant has shown cause as to why his detention in custody is not justified,’ Justice Mullins said. Crown prosecutor Ben Power argued there was a strong risk Tostee would flee with the threat of a mandatory 20-year prison sentence looming. But defence barrister Soraya Ryan argued Tostee's public profile meant he couldn't hide from authorities. Tostee has been in custody at the Arthur Gorrie Correctional Centre since he was arrested in mid-Augustand charged with murdering New Zealand woman, Warriena Wright, who fell to her death from his 14th floor apartment on August 8. The Avalon apartments (above) in Surfers Paradise on Queensland's Gold Coast were the scene of the fatal fall by Warriena Wright 14 storeys to the ground at around 2.20am on August 8 this year . At a bail hearing on Tuesday, prosecutors told the court that locking 26-year-old victim Warriena Wright outside on a 14th floor balcony was akin to locking someone in a trunk to suffocate. Justice  Mullins told the court the case 'is not in any view a straightforward case of murder'. Mr Tostee was arrested a week later after Ms Wright's death. Following the first, adjourned part of his bail hearing, Tostee replaced his original legal team with renowned Queensland civil liberties lawyer, Terry O'Gorman. Tostee's lawyers, from Brisbane firm Robertson O'Gorman said that while he was in prison, he was 'always on guard' against fellow inmates. Ms Wright died at around 2.20am, just hours after meeting Mr Tostee at Cavill Mall in Surfers Paradise via the mobile dating app Tinder. Mr Tostee denies he murdered Ms Wright. Mr Tostee appointed Mr O'Gorman following the civil libertarian's comments about the release of court documents including an alleged transcript of Ms Wright's night with him, taped on his phone, and a damning police affidavit of what occurred between the two in the hours before Ms Wright's death. The prosecution claims Tostee has a ‘bizarre indifference to Ms Wright's death’ and that she had been affected on the night of her death by alcohol in the form of a ‘white spirit’ made by him. Justice Mullins has made mention during the hearing of the accused’s autism and social anxiety. Strict conditions: Gable Tostee will live at his parents, Gary and Helene's house (pictured) while on bail, not drink alcohol, not use dating app Tinder and be under a 6pm to 6am curfew . Fatal meeting: Warriena Wright (above, left) was holidaying on the Gold Coast after attending a friend's wedding, when the 26-year-old New Zealand bank clerk fell to her death from Gable Tostee's (above, right) high rise balcony apartment. Mr Tostee has been granted bail and will be released . Devastated: Warriena Wright (above, right) with sister, Reza, who was devastated by the death . Mr O'Gorman described as 'absolutely worrying' police claims in the affidavit filed in the Brisbane Supreme Court, which included that Mr Tostee and Ms Wright allegedly had a fight before she fell. The police affidavit was among eleven documents filed for Gable Tostee's first bail application, before  Justice Debra Mullins, who adjourned the matter to give Mr Tostee's defence team more time. Crown Prosecutor Sarah Farnden told that hearing Mr Tostee was unlikely to have been on the balcony when Ms Wright plunged 14 storeys to her death. Justice Mullins described the Crown prosecutor's case for murder as 'weak' and 'difficult', but said a case of manslaughter would be 'strong'. Justice Mullins said a diagnosis of autism for Gable Tostee could have a bearing on how the court viewed what allegedly happened inside his Surfers Paradise apartment on the night Ms Wright died. 'If your client was not on the balcony, it makes the murder case a lot more difficult,' she told Mr Tostee's defence, 'but in the context of what happened in the apartment, I would think a manslaughter case is not weak.'

"Martin Murray takes his courage in both fists as he enters the ring in Monte Carlo this Saturday night to confront the most concussive pound-for-pound puncher in the world. Gennady Golovkin will greet him with a handshake and a smile, followed by flurries of the blows which have knocked out 28 of the 31 victims in his unbeaten professional career. Call It Fearless vs Fearsome. Martin Murray (right) faces the toughest challenge of his career against Gennady Golovkin on Saturday . Murray has vowed to give the fight his best shot despite being rated as a 25-1 underdog . Murray and Golovkin looked confident as they made the weight ahead of their world title bout in Monaco . Martin Murray: 159.9lb . Gennady Golovkin: 158.9lb . (Weight limit: 160lb) Murray declares himself ‘unafraid of being hurt’ by the iron-fisted Kazakh and insists he has perceived ‘chinks in Golovkin’s armour which I can exploit to upset the odds.’ If he does, the casinos in the principality will be paying out at 25-1. Golovkin talks respectfully of our reformed ex-prisoner as ‘a strong fighter who brings my toughest test so far’ but still believes ‘I will end it inside the 12 rounds.’ If he does, Murray will be stopped for the first time in a career in which he has yet to be sent to the canvas. Not even the only two men to deny Murray victory managed that in his two previous, close-run, world middleweight title challenges. Felix Sturm was given the benefit of a home-town draw in Germany, Sergio Martinez declared a disputed winner in Buenos Aires. Golovkin, however, is a more intimidating proposition than either of them. He not only hits like a steam-hammer to head and body but employs speed, mobility and a profound depth of ring cunning to create the openings for those punches. The Kazakh is unbeaten in 31 bouts, winning 28 by knockout - including against Daniel Geale (above) St Helens born Murray (right) has never been knocked to the canvas in his 31 fights . Name .

Golovkin sets more traps than a pest control agency and, in professional terms, the consequences can be just as fatal. The careers of several previously unbeaten challengers for his WBC world title have either been ended instantly by his blows or petered away into premature retirement a few fights later. Wayne Rooney is expected to be in attendance in the plush ballroom in Monaco, supporting the man from St Helens in the hope that he can deliver a miracle. Some of Murray’s domestic peers are making persuasive cases for Murray pushing Golovkin to the limit. Matthew Macklin, who was destroyed by a GGG-force body shot, says: ‘I’m sure Martin will give a very good account of himself.’ George Groves, who could find himself on Golovkin’s dance card in the future, says: ‘Martin is not only tough but a clever fighter and I don’t expect it to be easy for Gennady.’ But neither goes so far as to predict a British upset. Martin Murray's manager Andrew Mikhail is confident his charge will win after posting his bets on Twitter . Man United star Wayne Rooney is expected to be cheering Murray on from ringside at the Casino Royale . Murray has modified his initial bravado - ‘I’m going to knock his head off’ - by saying: ‘I have given everything humanly possible in training camp. I will give my all in the ring. I do not want to go home with any regrets about having given anything less than my absolute best.’ Murray, having turned his entire life around so admirably that his focus is now on his young family, has the strength of physique and will-power to return home with both his dignity and his future as a fighter intact. If he rises so spectacularly to the challenge as to rupture Golovkin’s invincibility, he will have won a gamble of James Bond proportions in Monte Carlo. Golovkin v Murray will be televised live on Channel 5 from 10 pm this Saturday night.","Martin Murray faces Gennady Golovkin for the WBA middleweight title .

"A minutes silence and a candlelight vigil has been held in Melbourne in honour of the world's leading experts in the battle against HIV who were killed while travelling on Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 en route to an AIDS conference in the city. The tragic loss of researchers who died should be used to push the life-saving agenda of the meeting, the UN AIDS chief  Mr Michel Sidibe urged as he spoke outside Melbourne Arts Centre Hamer Hall on Friday night. A special tribute to the former president of the International AIDS Society (IAS) and ‘giant’ of HIV research, Joep Lange, was also given by Mr Sidibe. A minutes silence was held in honour of the delegates travelling to an AIDS conference in Melbourne who were killed on flight MH17. Victorian Premier Denis Napthine, Proffesor Sharon Lewin, Robert Doyle, David Davis and Alischa Ross paid their respects . The UN AIDS chief shared an emotional hug with Proffessor Sharon Lewin after they both spoke of their talented friend, who was a father of four girls and a boy. The 20th International AIDS Conference was nearly cancelled after it emerged many of the 298 who died when Flight MH17 crashed in Ukraine were delegates with their family members. Organisers of AIDS2014 still don't know exactly how many of the 12,000 researchers coming to Melbourne for the five-day conference were on board MH17. Lord Mayor of Melbourne Robert Doyle, UNAIDS Executive Director Michel Sidibe, Victoria's Minister for Health David Davis and the Premier of Victoria Denis Napthine stood solemnly outside the Melbourne Arts Centre . UN AIDS Chief Mr Michel Sidibe said the tragic loss of researchers who died should be used to push the life-saving agenda of the AIDS conference . Professor Sharon Lewin (Co Chair Aids 2014) hugged UN AIDS Chief Mr Michel Sidibe after they both spoke of their friend Joep Lange who was killed on flight MH17 . Media reports put the number at 108, but a spokesman for the International Aids Society said there had been no confirmation of that figure. Mr Sidibe said the tragedy should be used to bring the dreams of the delegates into reality. 'We should use this day, which is a very difficult day for us, to transform it,' he said. 'We should use this moment of sadness as a moment for us to push our agenda; our agenda for saving lives of millions of people.' His sentiments were echoed by International AIDS Society president Francoise Barre-Sinoussi. Killed: Dr Joep Lange, a Dutch HIV researcher and former president of the International AIDS Society (left) and (right) Glenn Thomas, a British press officer for the World Health Organisation . It was tweeted that Pim de Kuijer (left) and Martine de Schutter (right) were on MH17, en route to AIDS2014 in Melbourne . 'The decision to go on, we were thinking about them because we know it's really what they would have liked us to do,' Prof Barre-Sinoussi said. She said the number of delegates on the flight remains unknown. 'We don't have the confirmation (of numbers),' she said. 'We don't know how many were on that flight.' US-based IAS president-elect Chris Beyrer told reporters in Melbourne it was not yet known how many ‘friends and colleagues’ had been lost, but the death of Prof Lange meant ‘the HIV/AIDS movement has truly lost a giant’. Professor Lange was one of 154 Dutch passengers on the jet apparently shot down over eastern Ukraine early on Friday while on its way to Kuala Lumpur, where he was scheduled to change planes. The Professor of Medicine at University of Amsterdam was travelling with his partner Jacqueline van Tongeren. He was due to speak on Sunday. Alischa Ross, the founder and CEO of YEAH (Youth Empowerment Against HIV/AIDs), gave a powerful speech . Candles were placed by a sign for flight MH17 on Princes Bridge . Flowers were placed alongside a message that read 'RIP, in memory of the many lives sadly lost on the way to beautiful Melbourne' Professor Lange’s colleagues said that he was one of those who had 'changed the course of humanity'. AIDS lobbyist Pim de Kuijer and other researchers Martine de Schutter and Lucie van Mens were on the flight, along with World Health Organisation media relations coordinator Glenn Thomas, who was British. 'It is with deep sadness that WHO lost one of our colleagues in the Malaysia crash,' Mr Hartl said of Mr Thomas. No other UN staff were on board the doomed flight, Mr Hartl said. US doctor Seema Yasmin described Professor Lange as a ‘kind man and a true humanitarian’. Taking to Twitter, Dr Yasmin said of her friend: ‘How do we measure how much a person has done for humanity? People like Joep change the course of humanity’. Nobel laureate Dr Francoise Barre-Sinoussi, co-discoverer of the AIDS virus and president of the International AIDS Society, said if confirmed, Prof Lange's death would be ‘a terrible loss for all of us’. He had dedicated his life to ‘the benefit of mankind’, he said. Victorian Premier Denis Napthine spoke outside Melbourne Arts Centre Hamer Hall, which will be lit up nightly from Friday July 18-21 with a series of unique digital art projections putting the spotlight on creating a HIV-free generation . UN AIDS Chief Michel Sidibe hugged Victorian Premier Denis Napthine after his emotional tribute to his friend . A crowd turned out to pay their respects to the delegates who lost their lives on flight MH17 . Close friend and Director of UNSW's Kirby Institute, Professor David Cooper said Prof Lange had been an integral part of the HIV response. ‘He was one of the first global advocates for treatment in low and middle income countries.’ Prof Cooper said his family had spent several holidays in Europe and Australia with Prof Lange, who had separated from his wife and found ‘true happiness with Jacqueline’. The AIDS conference must go ahead because that's what Prof Lange would have wanted, he said. ‘After this tragedy, it should be a wake up call for them (donors) to get back in there and increase their pledges, to finally end the tragedy of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.’ University of Melbourne's Professor Rob Moodie, a chair and speaker at the AIDS 2014 conference, said the loss of Prof Lange was a major blow to the HIV research community.

Delegates held a candle-lit vigil on Melbourne's Yarra Bridge on Friday evening. HIV worker Andrew Lesa, a delegate from New Zealand, said many of those who died were ‘giants in the industry’. ‘Their loss will be a big loss to the movement,’ Mr Lesa told AAP. He said continuing with the conference was the best way to honour those who died. ‘I don't think they would want it to be cancelled.’ The conference is the major scientific event for HIV, and speakers include former US president Bill Clinton and Sir Bob Geldof via video link, and UNAIDS executive director Michel Sidibe.

"These are the pictures that show how one man has followed his life's ambition to become 'the human platypus'. Jenya Bolotov, 26, has spent seven years transforming his features - stretching eight parts of his face beyond recognition - to emulate the distinctive bill of a platypus. He has stretched both of his ear lobes, his nostrils, septum and his top and bottom lip by more than nine-and-a-half inches altogether. Scroll down for video . The Human Platypus: Jenya Bolotov, 26, has spent seven years transforming his body to become the human platypus by stretching eight parts of his face beyond recognition until they resemble a platypus bill . Wow: Mr Bolotov has stretched his ear, nostrils, septum and his lips by more than nine-and-a-half inches . Quack: Mr Bolotov holds his artificially stretched lips together to mimic a platypus bill . He is also the only person in the world to have his 'Surna' - the very top bridge of his nose - stretched. The designer from Perm, Russia says he won't stop modifying his body until he realises his vision. 'I love platypus - the way they look and even the word ""platypus"" itself,' he said. 'I like the way my stretched face and lips now look like a platypus bill. 'All of the modifications I have added to my body make me feel whole. This is what I am now. It is what I have always wanted to be.' Mr Bolotov said he was very shy as a child and felt like he didn't fit in with the people around him. 'I was a very quiet child. When I was a kid, I felt as if I didn't belong in this world. I felt like it wasn't my world and that I was looking at it as if from outside,' he explained. 'I knew that I would have to genuinely change myself and live differently to feel happy.' 'I love platypus': The designer from Perm says he won't stop modifying his body until he realises his vision . 'This is what I am now': Mr Bolotov said he was very shy as a child and felt like he didn't fit in with people . Mr Bolotov first became aware of body modifications at the age of ten. 'When I saw body piercings for the first time on the internet, I became very interested. As I got older, I started learning about ear lobe stretching which was still very rare,' he said. 'I loved the way it looked - the way you could stretch your body to become who you want to be. It's such a beautiful art.' When he reached 18 and adulthood, Mr Bolotov decided he would stretch his ear lobes himself. 'I had no knowledge of how to do it so I made a lot of mistakes with my earlobes. But it was the start of my journey,' he said. After getting his first taste for cosmetic body modifications, he began to explore other body parts that he could hollow out. 'When I turned eighteen, I didn't know you could stretch anything else besides your ear lobes,' he said. 'But soon after I came across images of lip stretching in African countries and I liked them. 'Although I thought they were too small - I wanted my lip holes bigger. I wanted to take this ancient art to the next level. 'Then my friend said that if anyone could achieve a truly big, horizontal lip, they would look like a platypus. I wanted to be like that. I loved the large bill of a platypus.' Celebrity: Mr Bolotov modelling a fetching red smock at Mercedes Benz fashion week in Russia . He can talk? Mr Bolotov at the mic during Mercedes Benz fashion week. Despite his drastic facial modifications he says he can talk, eat and speak on the phone just like anybody else . At nineteen, Mr Bolotov started the slow and painful process of stretching his own top and bottom lip to attain this appearance. He would also embark on stretching both his nostrils and septum to create that elongated, billed look. Seven years later, he has finally achieved a permanent, stretched size of 58mm on his bottom lip and 33mm on his top lip. And he plans on steadily increasing these throughout his life. 'I would stretch my face and lips a little at a time and keep going. There was no limit,' he said. 'It has taken me years to get to where I am and now I feel like I finally belong in this world. 'Externally, I am now a platypus. My resemblance is the way I want it to be. Inside though, I am more like a bird. They're my spirit animal and they come to me in my dreams.' 'I would stretch my face and lips a little at a time': Mr Bolotov at 22 years old, left, and aged 21, right . 'It has taken me years to get to where I am': Mr Bolotov with a friend when he was 19 years old . First steps: At nineteen, Mr Bolotov started the slow  process of stretching his lips . Currently single: Mr Bolotov, right, aged 18, with another friend who appears to be into body modification . In spite of his seemingly impractical body modifications, Jenya Bolotov they don't affect his day-to-day life. 'I can eat, talk and speak on the phone like everyone else. Nothing has changed at all,' he said. 'I do attract a lot of negative attention when I walk down the street and sometimes people make mean comments. I'm used to it now though and I just try to ignore them.' However Mr Bolotov's unusual appearance has also won him a host of fans - who fondly call him 'The Human Platypus'. He said: 'I get a lot of fan mail from people telling me they're grateful for what I do and how I look. 'Some individuals have written to me, saying they wish they were able to change their body the way I have. 'Not everyone is free like me - they have an internal battle inside them that makes them feel like they can't become who they want to be. 'It takes bravery to do what I've done and I will keep modifying my body until I am happy.' Before the platypus: Mr Bolotov, left, when he was a fresh-faced 16-year-old . 'Externally, I am now a platypus': The semiaquatic egg-laying mammal that Mr Bolotov aspires to become . Mr Bolotov is currently single but says there is a woman who he is in love with from afar. 'I do not have a girlfriend but there is a person I love very much. We're not in a relationship,' he said. 'I can be attracted to anyone whether they have body modifications or not. I hope there is not a particular 'type' of girl who finds me attractive either.'","Jenya Bolotov, 26, has spent seven years transforming his features .

"A holidaymaker was left £27,000 in debt after mobile phone company Orange extracted £120 an hour from her account for almost a week. Anne Roberts was horrified to discover NatWest had repeatedly allowed the funds to be taken after she purchased a £20 pay-as-you-go phone while holidaying in Wales. A technical blip meant Orange had been withdrawing £20.49p from Ms Roberts’ account every ten minutes since she bought it. Nasty surprise: Anne Roberts was horrified to discover Orange had extracted £27,000 from her bank account after she purchased a £20 pay-as-you-go phone while holidaying in Wales . Mrs Roberts had decided to buy the cheap phone with a £20 top up card from the Orange store in Carmarthen because her own mobile phone had no signal in Cwmdu near Llandudno. But less than a week later she was shocked to find her bank account was more than £27,000 overdrawn. Mrs Robers, from Ashburton, Devon,  said: 'I had a text message on my phone from the bank saying I had to pay funds in. 'I went and put my card into the machine and found that I was £27,210.72p in debt.' She immediately went to a nearby NatWest bank branch where staff stayed until after closing time in order to resolve the problem. Mrs Roberts said after sifting through 500 pages of bank statements, bank staff discovered that Orange had been withdrawing money every ten minutes. She then spent two days of her holiday trying to resolve the mess. Glitch: Mrs Roberts said after sifting through 500 pages of statements, bank staff discovered that Orange had been withdrawing money every ten minutes . Mrs Roberts went back to the Orange shop and was told the entire bank statement needed to be faxed to the company. She said: 'I couldn’t take it all in, so they allowed me to take a tenth of the statement in.' She had also been credited by the company 792 times but had to cut short her break because of phone calls from collection agencies. Orange apologised and said the money had been refunded. A spokesman said: 'We have identified a technical issue resulted in multiple card payments being taken from her account for the purchase she made in our Carmarthen store. 'We have begun a high priority investigation to determine the cause and have been working closely with Mrs Roberts to ensure all payments taken in error are refunded in full.

"Ukip’s immigration policy was left in chaos this morning after it rejected claims it wanted to repatriate foreign workers after leaving the EU – by promising an amnesty for all three million European migrants to stay in Britain. Mark Reckless, the party’s candidate in tomorrow’s crunch Rochester by-election, sparked outrage after claiming that once Britain left the European Union migrants would only be allowed to stay for a ‘fixed period’. But Ukip this morning insisted that 'there is no intention whatsoever to backdate future border controls to penalise those already here’. The u-turn means the 2.8million EU nationals living and working in Britain would be given the right to stay in the UK after an EU exit. Scroll down for video . Ukip parliamentary candidate Mark Reckless (pictured) caused outrage by suggesting migrants who have lived here for several years could be repatriated . Mr Reckless triggered tomorrow's by election in Rochester by defecting from the Tories to Ukip . A UKIP supporter leaves their campaign office in Rochester on the final day of campaigning ahead of tomorrow's Rochester and Strood by-election . It comes after Mr Reckless refused to deny Ukip would look to deport a plumber from Poland who owned a home and had children at local schools he did not rule it out, but said this would be a case ‘we would look sympathetically at’. Mr Reckless was addressing an audience of dozens of local residents at a hustings with other candidates in the Rochester and Strood by-election. His remarks were met with jeers and the Labour candidate, PR consultant Naushabah Khan, whose father came from Pakistan in the 1980s and whose mother is Kenyan Asian, said: ‘Where would you stop Mark? My family are migrants, are we going to say they need to go back as well?’ Mr Reckless said British citizens would be able to stay but Ukip’s aim was that migration policy would be the same for EU member states as for other parts of the world. Mr Reckless this morning attempted to clarify his remarks on immigration, after last night saying that people from the European Union who had settled in the UK should be granted leave to stay ‘for a fixed period’ only. 'I said we would give people from the EU who were already here, including such a Polish plumber, a work permit to allow him to stay. 'Anyone's who's here legally, under the current EU arrangements, we would want to ensure that they remained legally by issuing a work permit to anyone who was in that category already in the country. For new people coming in we'd apply a points-based system.' Tory candidate Kelly Tolhurst (pictured left alongside Cabinet minister Eric Pickles) has also put immigration at the top of her plan for the area . A portrait of David Cameron drowning in a red sea of UKIP , by political artist Kaya Mar . Rochester and Strood by-election, was on sale today . Labour candidate Naushabah Khan (pictured, left, with Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman) questioned Mr Reckless over the comment that immigrants could be deported . A Ukip spokesman added: 'Ukip and Mark have always been completely clear on this. Do not believe the desperate last throw of the dice from the Conservative party. 'There is no intention whatsoever to backdate future border controls to penalise those already here. 'Mark simply made the absolutely common sense point that there will be a period after future border control arrangements have been agreed before they come into effect.’ But shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said Mr Reckless had ‘let the mask slip’. She said: ‘To hear the language of repatriation coming from someone they hope will be their second MP is shameful. It's a policy that comes straight out of the last BNP manifesto and does not reflect British values. ‘Be it Mark Reckless talking about repatriation, council candidates who attack Lenny Henry for the colour of his skin, or party thugs who overturn other parties' street stalls, nasty views are not far below the surface.’ Former home office minister Damian Green (pictured) said Mr Reckless had come ‘perilously close’ to a policy of repatriation and insisted his remarks were ‘totally unacceptable’ Ukip leader Nigel Farage’s wife is German. The party has never previously mentioned sending home settled migrants. Damian Green, the Conservative MP for nearby Ashford, said: ‘This sounds perilously close to repatriation and however strongly people feel about immigration this kind of policy is completely unacceptable.’ The host of the debate, screened last night on ITV Meridian, asked Mr Reckless if a Polish plumber living in Rochester would have to return home if Britain left the European Union. Labour frontbencher Chris Bryant (pictured) said 'jaws dropped' when the comment was made . He replied: ‘I think in the near term we’d have to have a transitional period, we should probably allow people who are currently here to have a work permit at least for a fixed period.’ Mr Reckless added before being cut off by jeering: ‘People who have been here a long time and integrated in that way I think we’d want to look sympathetically at. ‘What we would want to do is…apply a consistent Australian-style points system, the same to people coming from Europe as we do to those coming from say the Commonwealth, from Australia, Africa, India, the Caribbean, we shouldn’t have a discriminatory system which favours Europeans.’ Labour frontbencher Chris Bryant, who attended the debate said: ‘Jaws dropped on the floor when he said it. They are advocating repatriation, but it’s not clear of whom. ‘It sounds like a kangaroo court of Ukip officials would decide who stays and who goes. This shows how dangerous ill-thought out populism can be.’ Mr Reckless is on course to win the Kent seat, with polls putting his party around 15 points ahead of the Conservatives. The Tory candidate, 36-year-old marine surveyor Kelly Tolhurst, has also put immigration at the top of her six-point plan for the area. In one of her campaign leaflets she wrote that she had ‘seen the negative impact of uncontrolled immigration’ in the constituency, and said she had told the Prime Minister: ‘We need action, not just talk.’ Three Conservative MPs are holding ballots about European Union membership that are almost identical to those carried out by two Ukip defectors. Peter Bone, MP for Wellingborough, Philip Hollobone, of Kettering, and Martin Vickers, of Cleethorpes, are asking constituents whether they want to be in or out of the EU. Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless conducted similar exercises before defecting. They are all thought to have been advised by anti-EU campaigner Chris Bruni-Lowe, who has long-standing links with Ukip. Mr Bone said ‘private donors’ were funding his referendum and that his original leaflet was a ‘crib of the one Mark Reckless did’. All three MPs firmly denied any intention to defect. Mr Bone joked: ‘I haven’t even been invited to lunch [by Ukip].’ Mr Vickers said there was ‘absolutely no way’ that he would switch to Ukip. But the revelation will heighten Tory jitters ahead of Thursday's Rochester and Strood by-election.","Ukip Rochester candidate Mark Reckless caused outrage during hustings .

"America awoke this Saturday morning marvelling at how The Greatest boxer of all time has fought off Parkinson’s for so long to reach the grand old age of 73. The most powerful nation on Earth will then hope to celebrate Muhammad Ali’s birthday by finally reclaiming a major portion of the world heavyweight title, which it was once accustomed to brandishing as the symbol of its manhood. Ali, having emerged miraculously from yet another hospital scare, is expected to spend his evening watching on television as the latest American contender for his throne strives to bring home the most cherished of the heavyweight belts. Muhammad Ali will turn 73 on Saturday and has recently survived another hospital scare . Ali, shown at a training session in Kinshasa, Zaire, in 1974, was diagnosed with Parkinson's  30 years ago . Ali makes a face during a press conference in New York to promote his fight with George Foreman in 1974 . Deontay Wilder, another black Adonis of the prize ring, will be in Las Vegas challenging Bermane Stiverne for the WBC title having vowed: ‘Ali’s crown is coming back where it belongs.’ Since the boy from Tuscaloosa, Alabama has flattened all his 32 professional opponents thus far inside four rounds, the US is agog that he will deliver on that promise. That sense of impending destiny is encouraged by the return to the boxing big time of the larger-than-life promoter who staged Ali’s epic Rumble in the Jungle with George Foreman. Don King is back in electrified business as the Svengali of Stiverne, the first Haitian-born heavyweight champion of the world. But his presence in the MGM Grand Garden Arena will be seen as a key piece in the jigsaw of American fight history slipping into place. King has promoted 12 of America’s 13 US-born WBC heavyweight champions. The only exception was the first to wear that belt, Sonny Liston, who was sensationally knocked out 41 years ago next month by Ali in his first incarnation as a brash young man called Cassius Clay. Deontay Wilder will be looking to hit the jackpot in Las Vegas this Saturday when he faces Bermane Stiverne . Wilder, pictured punching Jason Gavern, will fight Stiverne on Saturday . Promoter Don King, who publicised the Rumble in the Jungle, will be back on Saturday as well . Although he hopes that Stiverne, who now fights out of Canada, will withstand Wilder’s all-American hammer blows, King’s real achievement at this moment is his re-emergence from the boxing shadows in his 80s. The nostalgia which will accompany him at ringside in Vegas will be all the more profound given the coincidence of a birthday which Ali was not widely expected to reach. This is an occasion awash with statistics, starting with that of no American having held so much as a particle of the heavyweight championship for almost a decade. Yet the most remarkable figure is 30, the number of years since Ali was first diagnosed with Parkinson’s. The average survival span while suffering from this pernicious affliction is 16 years. By that estimation it is extraordinary that Ali has lived beyond his late 50s. Ali stands over fallen challenger Sonny Liston in Lewiston, Maine, in May 1965 . The 'Match of the Century' between Ali (right) and George Foreman (left) in Kinshasa, Zaire, in 1974 . Thirty years, going on 31 now, is a monumental tribute to the fighting spirit which continues to infuse Ali’s life so long after it galvanised the hardest game of all, nerved him to champion civil rights in America, steeled him to oppose the Vietnam War and even now rouses him to condemn the violent extremists who pervert the religion to which he converted. Parkinson’s has virtually silenced what was once the most loquacious tongue in sport but it has not dulled a kaleidoscopic mind as dazzlingly brilliant as his footwork and handiwork in the ring. To sit with him, as I did at his 70th birthday dinner in his home town Louisville and during his visit to the London Olympics, is to see the lights in those penetrating eyes fully switched on. Far from surrendering to the ravages of disease, or even complaining of it, he has used its restrictions as a cocoon for quiet reflection on his life and times. Much of the energy he husbands is expended on the many charities which benefit from his thriving foundation, for which he often travels to Louisville from his latest home in the soothing warmth of Arizona. Yes, he looks frail at times. No, he does not look enfeebled. Ali has his gloves strapped by Angelo Dundee during a training session in September 1965 . The Greatest boxer of all time speaks and gestures after a fight in August 1978 . Concern for his well-being is at its most acute at times of medical alarm. The most recent emergency admission to hospital came amid reports that he had contracted pneumonia, one of the most frequently fatal conditions for Parkinson’s sufferers. By the time he was discharged, last week, after a fortnight much of which was spent in intensive care, that diagnosis had been revised to a urinary tract infection. That is not always good news, either, but he has rebuffed it with the fortitude with which he resisted the sledgehammer punches of Liston, Foreman and so many others in a golden era for heavyweight boxing. Of course, having the resources to finance the finest and most expensive specialist treatment helps prolong life expectancy in cases like his. Ali, pictured in March 2012, adjusts his glasses on stage at Muhammad Ali's Celebrity Fight Night XVIII . Ali holds a drink following a fight in August 1978 as he wears a dressing gown . Thus it is by protecting her husband’s finances and maximising his income potential that his devoted fourth wife Lonnie confounds those, mostly among Ali’s old guard, who frown upon the public appearances to which she gives her approval, be they glittering social functions or the funerals of old rivals such as Joe Frazier who were expected to outlive him. And no-one knows better than she how much he still relishes being in the spotlight of public attention. This is one of the world’s greatest showmen, lest we forget, and had he been confined to a rocking chair on his porch we would surely have mourned his passing years ago. As it is, Ali will be watching intently as Wilder goes in Bronze Bomber pursuit of the one heavyweight belt not in possession of Wladimir Klitschko. The WBC title slipped from the grasp of that Ukrainian family, which put down 16 years ago its first marker in what has become virtual world heavyweight domination, when elder brother Vitali retired. Ali (right) steps up to the ropes to confront Joe Bugner during their bout in August 1978 . A reunification fight with Wladimir is envisaged, one of giant proportions if Wilder, also 6ft 7in tall, beats Stiverne. If Wilder were to go on and usurp Klitschko, America would have its first superhero heavyweight since Evander Holyfield and Mike Tyson back in the hey-day. For the moment it will settle for is first winner of a heavyweight title by any alphabelt since Shannon Briggs in 2007, its first of the hallowed WBC championship since Hasim Rahman one year before that. And that would be the best birthday present The Greatest of them all could receive. Happy birthday, champ.

"Jamaican sprinters  excel at the sport because of their symmetrical knees. Research has discovered that runners with the most even knees have the quickest track times over 100 metres, because it is the only race which requires running in a straight line. While runners who had to make corners in longer races were found to have more uneven knees. Jamaican sprinters (gold medalists Nickel Ashmeade, Kemar Bailey-Cole, Usain Bolt and Nesta Carter pictured) excel at the sport because of their symmetrical knees. Research has found that runners with the most even knees have the quickest track times over 100 metres . 'You can easily imagine why,' explained evolutionary biologist and professor of anthropology and biology Robert Trivers of Rutgers University. 'If you watch someone running a 100-metre race, you can see his or her knees continually churning up and down, propelling the sprinter forward. Research from the University of New Mexico recently found that symmetrical human faces are more beautiful to the opposite sex. Women partnered with men who have symmetrical bodies have more orgasms, for example. And women with symmetrical breasts are more fertile than those with less even breasts. The trend is also spotted in nature, where bees are attracted to symmetrical flowers because they typically produce more nectar. 'Symmetry is very efficient.' The study explored why Jamaica is home to so many of the world's elite sprinters - runners who compete in the 100, 200, 400 and 800-metre races. Previous research noticed that the symmetry of children's knees at age eight can be used to predict how fast a person runs 14 years later in life. For the more recent study, researchers measured the knees of 74 elite Jamaican sprinters from the MVP Track and Field Club. This included Jamaican Olympic 100-metre champion, Shelly Ann Fraser-Pryce, and Nesta Carter, the man with the fifth fastest 100-metre runs ever recorded. A control group included 116 non-sprinting Jamaicans of the same age, sex, size and weight. They found the 30 sprinters who specialised in the 100-metre race had knees that were much more symmetrical, according to the study published in the journal PLOS ONE. Researchers  measured the knees of 74 elite Jamaican sprinters (Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce pictured). A control group included 116 non-sprinting Jamaicans of the same age, sex, size and weight. They found the 30 sprinters who specialised in the 100-metre race had knees that were much more symmetrical . ProfessorTrivers said: 'So far as we know, this is the first time anyone has isolated a variable that predicts sprinting speed in the future as well as among the very best adult sprinters now.' Symmetrical individuals not only tend to be stronger, healthier and better-looking, but symmetry also makes movement easier and saves energy. While this study establishes a relationship between knee symmetry and running speed in elite sprinters, it does not establish a causal relationship. Professor Trivers concluded: 'We don't know for sure whether the sprinters are great sprinters because their knees are symmetrical, or whether their knees are symmetrical because of all the time they spend practicing.' Future studies will compare the differences in the strength of sprinters' right and left legs, to see whether the symmetry between them changes over time.","Researchers measured the knees of 74 elite Jamaican sprinters .

"A female gorilla tenderly cares for her baby in the rainforest of the Republic of Congo while its father looks on in this touching series of photographs. The baby gorilla is seen nestling into the female western lowland gorilla's chest for a feed, while in another picture the newborn takes a ride on her back as she makes her way around the Odzala-Kokoua National Park. And with the doting female diligently watching from the ground, the young primate was also photographed climbing a tree to forage for food. Tender: A female gorilla is seen tending to her baby as the pair share a moment in the Congolese rainforest . Father: The baby's 31 stone father, called Neptuno, watched the mother and child from a few feet away . The pictures of the critically endangered gorillas were taken by wildlife photographer James Weis, who also managed to a capture a magnificent portrait of the 31 stone dominant male called Neptuno staring down his camera lens. Mr Weis, 52, from Chicago, US, was on a guided trek through the dense and pristine rainforest to find the family group named after its impressive silverback leader and protector. 'The trekking was relatively easy compared with the mountain gorilla treks but the low level foliage makes getting clear shots a bit challenging,' said Mr Weis, who also runs a tour company called Eyes on Africa and had to take the pictures in complete silence so as not to disturb theanimals.

"Tyson Fury stands poised on Saturday night between the pinnacle of a mega-fight with world heavyweight supremo Wladimir Klitschko and the abyss of absurdly premature retirement, at just 26. The giant Manchester traveller can nail down a multi-world title challenge to Klitschko with an impressive victory over Christian Hammer at London’s O2 Arena. Alternatively, Fury is vowing to hang up the gloves if he loses to his little-known and lightly-regarded German opponent. Tyson Fury (left) and Christian Hammer had to be pulled apart as they clashed at the weigh-in on Friday . The prospect of Fury being granted his wish of taking on Klitschko, the long-time holder of all but one of the heavyweight belts, will be strengthened by the presence at ringside of American TV mogul Ken Hershman. The president of sports for the giant HBO cable TV network has flown to London to evaluate the box office potential of Klitschko v Fury. Hershman comes to town just as promoter Frank Warren has agreed a Fury-Klitschko fight in September. Warren says: ‘I have no doubt that this fight will happen now. We are looking at a football stadium in September.’ Tempers flared as the two heavyweights and their entourages clashed at the weigh-in . Wladimir Klitschko is set to fight Bryant Jennings in New York's Madison Square Gardens at the end of April . Whether that open-air spectacular takes place here or in Germany remains a matter of on-going negotiations. Warren always tries to secure home advantage for his boxers but Klitschko has regularly been drawing 60,000-plus crowds to football stadiums in his adopted Germany throughout his 10-year reign as the titular heavyweight champion. As their man is champion, Team Klitschko will carry greater weight in such decisions. All depends, of course, on Fury not being caught out by his occasional vulnerability to meaty blows to his chin and Hammer vows: ‘I’m coming to spoil the party by knocking him out.’ Fury should handle Hammer comfortably, however, and he knows it. He says: ‘If I can’t beat this guy I have no place even thinking about fighting Klitschko. If I were to lose this one there would be no point me carrying on. I would give up boxing.’ Fury during the weigh-in ahead of his heavyweight fight with Hammer, will hope to face Klitschko next . Yet he needs to keep active in the ring, especially given a long spell of inactivity following the cancellation of two big dates with David Haye. ‘Boxing is a risk business,’ he says. ‘I need the fights.’ These best-laid plans would also collapse if Klitschko were to lose to unbeaten American Bryant Jennings in a voluntary defence of his titles at New York’s iconic Madison Square Garden on April 25. That, too, is highly unlikely but with the heavyweights one punch can change the world order. But unless that happens Fury will not face US knock-out sensation Deontay Wilder, who has just won the WBC world title which is the only belt not in Wlad the Impaler’s possession, before challenging Klitschko. Warren says: ‘Wladimir will be first for Tyson, although Wilder is another big fight waiting to happen after that.’ Eubank Jnr and Chudinov show off their physiques during the weigh-in at the 02 . Chris Eubank Jr would appear to face a somewhat sterner test at the 02 than Fury. The son of Eubank challenges Dmitry Chudinov for the WBA interim middleweight title. But although most of Eastern Europe seems to fancy the Russian’s chances, his lack of speed and mobility ought to be ideal for Eubank and I expect him to join Fury in the winner’s enclosure, both by mid-fight stoppage. Carl Frampton should make it a clean Saturday night sweep for British boxing in the home-town Belfast defence of his world super-bantamweight title against Chris Avalos. The Mexican-American is a born fighter but his slugging aggression leaves him an open target and Frampton, a natural counter-puncher, will likely break him down inside eight or nine rounds. As Frampton brings boxing the welcome boost of a return to mainstream terrestrial broadcasting with ITV, that channel and BoxNation are trying to finesse times so that viewers can watch Eubank and then Fury immediately before switching to Frampton. Chris Eubank Jnr also weighed in ahead of his fight with Dimtry Chudinov on Saturday . Fury-Hammer and Eubank-Chudinov will be live on BoxNation from 7 pm. Frampton- Avalos will be live on ITV from 10 pm, preceded by the undercard on ITV 4.","Tyson Fury takes on Christian Hammer at the O2 in London on Saturday .

"A mother who says Walmart employees intentionally humiliated her after wrongfully ripping up two of her $100 bills while believing they were fake is taking legal action against the store. In her recently filed complaint, Julia Garcia is seeking no more than $74,900 in damages after detained for four hours before customers in San Antonio, Texas who were told she had tried to use fake money. It was in the early hours of December 18, 2010 while doing some Christmas shopping for her children that Ms Garcia claims she presented the first $100 bill as payment before it was taken with suspicion from her. Mishandled: A WalMart customer has filed a complaint against the store under claims employees wrongly ripped two $100 bills from her claiming they were fake . She says that the bill wasn't actually tested by a counterfeit detection pen until after it was ripped, though that pen's result was either misread or ignored by the cashier. According to her complaint: 'The cashier inspected the $100 bill, turned to another cashier and had a brief discussion, and returned to her register telling Plaintiff that her money was ""fake."" 'The cashier proceeded to rip the $100 bill in half without performing any counterfeit detection tests. The metallic strip in the $100 bill was clearly visible.' After marking the bill with the detection pen, revealing a yellowish colour across it, Ms Garcia said she explained to the cashier of that colour meaning it was legitimate, having previously worked in retail herself. Humiliated: Julia Garcia says she was detained for four hours at the front of the store in San Antonio, Texas, pictured . The employee proceeded to call a manager over who identified himself as Russell. At this time Ms Garcia said she took out a second $100 bill, which according to her, was immediately taken and ripped up as well by the man. Test: A counterfeit bill detector pen, like the one shown, was used on the bills by the employees but only after they had been ripped according to the woman . Detained at the front of the store while told the police had been called, Ms Garcia claims that adding to her humiliation, the employees told curious customers in passing that she was busted trying to use fake money. After two hours at the front, police arrived around 4.15am and proceeded to inspect the bills in question. Following a series of tests the first responding officer, identified as Officer Edwards, returned to Ms Garcia telling her that what the Walmart employee and manager had done was a 'terrible mistake.’ 'He then approached the manager, who appeared upset by what he was told by Officer Edwards,' according to the complaint. ‘After speaking with Officer Edwards, Manager Russell approached Plaintiff and sarcastically stated that the police officers said the money was not counterfeit, though he disagreed. ‘At this time, he attempted to hand Plaintiff the two torn $100 bills he had misappropriated from her. When Plaintiff objected to receiving torn bills, Officer Edwards instructed Manager Russell to replace the bills he had wrongfully taken and destroyed.' Ms Garcia, who said she was escorted out to her car by the officer around 5am, filed her complaint for false imprisonment and intentional infliction of emotional distress against the store on September 9.","Julia Garcia says two employees ripped up $200 in bills before using a counterfeit detection pen on them .

"Floyd Mayweather will announce at his teasing convenience that the richest fight in boxing history will take place in Las Vegas on May 2. All that remains of the long wait for the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world to take on the pretender to that mythical title, Manny Pacquiao, is for Money Mayweather to confirm that it’s on at last. Mayweather and the Filipino Pac-Man are to be paid a combined purse of $250million for answering the public demand that they finally settle their five-year argument in the ring. Floyd Mayweather was at the NBA All-Star weekend as the world waited for him to announce his fight . Mayweather will face his long-time rival Pacquiao on May 2 at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas . That cash-crazy neon desert Strip has lit up with electric expectation that Mayweather is ready to confirm what has long seemed inevitable. The right to tell the world is one of his many stipulations in a contract to which all parties are reliably reported to have agreed after an eternity of wrangling. The deal now done barring a seismic tantrum by Mayweather is also believed to include a rematch clause for a second $300m extravaganza back at the MGM grand in the autumn. The minutiae of which gloves each combatant will wear, the Olympic standard drugs testing which Mayweather has long demanded and Pacquiao’s acquiescence to a smaller share of the fortune are all included. The two major cable networks in America – Showtime, who hold a six-fight contract with Mayweather, and Pacquiao’s paymasters HBO – have settled for both broadcasting this extraordinary event. Mayweather last fought when he beat Marcos Maidana in their rematch last September . Mayweather and Pacquiao have been negotiating since they came face-to-face on a basketball court . And it remains a major spectacle, even though the world of boxing would have preferred that these two men in their mid-to-late 30s had got it on all these five years ago. The precedent for two-channel transmission was set when Mike Tyson and Lennox Lewis clashed in a heavyweight bonanza in June 2002. The final sticking point – which of Showtime or HBO should have rights to the first replay broadcast a few days later – now appears to have been resolved. The fee for the pay TV subscription in America is expected to be a record $100… or maybe $99.95 if they are feeling generous to the public! The cost for ringside tickets at the MGM Grand Garden Arena will sell at the order of $5000 apiece. In expectation of the demand the hotels in Vegas have been hiking their room prices for that Mexico national celebration weekend in advance. Thousands of high-rollers, not just from south of the border and the US, but from around the world, have been booking in advance. With even his lesser share of the booty, Pacquiao’s minimum $100m has been ample incentive for him to concede such trifles as Mayweather – who will receive $150m - taking the lead billing as well as both entering the ring and being acclaimed last by the ring announcer. Pacquiao was last in action when he dominated Chris Algieri over 12 rounds in Macau last November . Although there were fears, justified or not, that Mayweather would prefer not to risk his unbeaten record against the Philippines congressman, who is still the biggest threat to that distinction, the offer seems to have proved too good to refuse. From a British point of view, it’s an obvious disappointment for Amir Khan to miss out on fighting either one of them, but even he has admitted that he wants to see the fight. The pair are likely to undertake a tour of some of the planet’s major capitals to help promote interest, and of course supplementary TV sales around the world, including Britain where Sky Sports, BT Sport and perhaps even BoxNation might find themselves in competition with, if not taxpayer funded BBC, then ITV, who could go for pay per view for the first time. The boost for boxing in this modern communications world will be so huge that it could elevate the hard old game into a major sport on both sides of the Atlantic. A worldwide of multiple millions, will, of course, spread out from the boxing enthusiasts across the full spectrum of society. The fun and games of all the negotiation and delays appears to be over. Let the blood sport begin. The one remaining danger, perverse thought it may seem, is that Mayweather will be so enraged by this information leaking in America that he blows the deal and all those millions sky high.","Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao to announce their fight .

Just after midday on May 30, Tian drove for 5km down a motorway in the wrong direction with a blood alcohol reading that was more than double the limit, the New Zealand Herald reported. She weaved in between oncoming cars, travelling at speeds ranging between 28 km/h and 134 km/h before eventually crashing into Ms Yong's car head on. Ms Yong, a professional ceroc dancer, suffered critical injuries and her family in Malaysia travelled to New Zealand before making the decision to switch off her life support. Pregnant Tian appeared in Manukau District Court on Monday in a wheelchair due to leg injuries she suffered in the crash. Judge Sharon McAuslan told Tian through a Chinese interpreter that she would not be able to serve her time from home, despite the fact that she is pregnant. Judge McAuslan said her driving was 'totally appalling'. Ms Yong's mother Marina Lee, who travelled from Kuala Lumpur to Auckland for the sentencing, told the court: 'Nobody can fathom the grief of a mother when her daughter is wrenched away from her. 'This grossly negligent driver needs to be punished, not just for the needless loss of my child, but to caution all other drivers to think through their actions.' Ms Yong's sister Sharon Yong told the Herald she thought the sentence was too light, adding that an apology letter written to the family by Tian felt insincere. 'It was written as a means of lowering her sentence, that's how it felt to us.'

"Among the millions of war heroes who will be commemorated in America on Tuesday November 11 is one of the greatest boxers who ever lived. Joseph Louis Barrow – as he was born in Lafayette, Alabama 100 years and six months ago – was not killed in action. Indeed, he did not see combat during World War II despite being a private in the army. Joe Louis at Camp Upton in 1942 just after enlisting in the US Army (left) and in London in 1944 . Born: May 13, 1914. Died: April 12, 1981 . Weight: Heavyweight . Record . Fights: 70 . Wins: 66. Wins by KO: 52 . Losses: 3 No contest: 1 . He was world heavyweight champion from 1937 to 1949 . They do things a little differently over there. This is not Remembrance Day in the US. Memorial Day, the last Monday in May, is when they pay specific tribute to those who have made the ultimate sacrifice. November 11 is Veterans’ Day, when they honour all past members of the military. And Joe Louis did his bit for country even though he never fired a bullet in anger. Not that the Brown Bomber, as he was also known, was unwilling to go to the front. Exactly one month after America declared war on Japan, following the attack on Pearl Harbour, the heavyweight champion of the world walked into an army camp near New York to voluntarily enlist as a private. When told by the clerk to state his occupation, Louis responded: ‘Fighting… them Japs.’ A trickier question came from fellow African-Americans who asked why he was joining the then-racially segregated US army. Again he had the answer: ‘Lots of things wrong with America - but Hitler ain‘t gonna fix ‘em.’ Louis shakes the hand of a taxi driver during his trip to London in 1944 . Shrewdly, the authorities perceived that for all his physical courage his greater value would be recruiting more black soldiers, who made an important contribution and suffered numerous casualties. Among those who followed him into uniform was Jackie Robinson, the young baseball slugger whose subsequent signing by the Brooklyn Dodgers broke that sport’s six-decade colour barrier. The impact of Louis on race relations in the US was even more profound. The US Army recruitment poster in World War II . The remark about Hitler made him a driving force for anti-Nazi sentiment across all sections of society there and strengthened support for the decision to enter the war. Then a widely distributed recruitment poster (right) helped him become America’s first non-white national hero. It showed ‘Pvt. Joe Louis’ saying: ‘We’re going to do our part... and we’ll win because we’re on God’s side.’ In company with another ring legend, Sugar Ray Robinson, Louis travelled to Europe and the Far East, raising troop morale in the course of 96 exhibition fights watched by a combined two million soldiers. American’s latent resentment of a black man holding the supreme world title - and not only that being acclaimed as the greatest heavyweight champion of his and all previous eras – evaporated. He became a sought-after celebrity. The tax-man was not so forgiving. Louis received not one dime of the 90,000 dollars he generated for the war effort with a series of fund-raising bouts. Nevertheless the Inland Revenue Service added that amount to his income……and to the $500,000 tax assessment already demanded despite his handlers milking all but an estimated $800,000 from his purses totalling more than $6 million. Such can be the spoils of war. Louis returned to the prize-ring in 1946, having to fight for the money as well as the glory, and was fiscally obliged to make a come-back after one retirement. The end came with an eighth round KO by Rocky Marciano – only his third loss in 70 fights – at the conclusion of a severe beating in Madison Square Garden. He was to admit that the financial stress drove him to drugs and his last years were difficult. But America did not forget. Certainly not one American president. Louis (left) hands out a severe beating to a bloodied Arturo Godoy at Yankee Stadium in New York in 1940 . When Louis died in 1981, aged just 66, Ronald Reagan decreed he should be buried at the Arlington National Cemetery, with full military honours. On November 11 in Great Britain and the Commonwealth, we bow our heads in respect for the fallen. We know, also, that service takes many forms. Joseph Louis Barrow did his part. At a time when it became fashionable to say that the Brown Bomber was a credit to his race, renowned New York Post sports reporter Jimmy Cannon wrote thus: ‘Yes, Joe Louis is a credit to his race… the human race.’ Had he been born this side of the Atlantic, he would have worn his poppy with pride. There could be life in 'Alien' Hopkins yet despite his Krushing . There is a clamour for Bernard Hopkins to retire following Saturday night’s loss of his world light-heavyweight title to Sergey Kovalev, just two months short of his 50th birthday. After all, he was knocked down in the first and lost the ensuing 11 rounds as well to end up on the wrong end of a whitewash decision in Atlantic City. Yet there may be life in the old pug yet. Bernard Hopkins (left) gets hit by Sergey Kovalev of Russia during the third round of The Alien's defeat . The Alien – as he calls himself in reference to his phenomenal athletic condition for a human of his age – went the distance with the Russian who knocks out almost everyone he fights and is therefore dubbed ‘Krusher.’ Nathan Cleverly - the decades younger Welshman who is among those who have been ‘Krushed’ - returns to the ring to face British rival Tony Bellew in Liverpool on Saturday week. Hopkins gave a more distinguished account of himself and could call it quits with great distinction, as the oldest world champion ever. So it his decision, alone, if he chooses make further history as a title challenger at 50. Cleverly v Bellew will be live on Sky Sports. Can The Alien can achieve another first? That of fighting on extra-terrestrial television.","Joe Louis never saw conflict but was an American Army hero .

"An Ohio teacher has been suspended without pay for allegedly making racist remarks towards a student, and may be fired from the school. The Fairfield Board of education suspended Gil Voigt on Monday for telling an African American student earlier this month on December 3, 'we don't need another black president' after the student expressed interest in becoming president one day. Voigt has taught at Fairfield Freshman school for 13 years and this is not the first time he's gotten in trouble for racist remarks. Board president Dan Murray say the suspension is the first step in dismissing the teacher. Gil Voigt has been a teacher at Fairfield Freshman High School for 13 years and may finally get the boot . Cincinnati.com reported that Assistant Superintendent Roger Martin compiled a list of all of Voigt's offenses. In 2008, Voigt made an inappropriate racial comment. That same year he got in trouble for improper use of school technology. In 2012, he received a verbal warning for calling a student 'stupid.' 'This is a rare occurrence. This is the first time I’ve faced it since being named assistant superintendent (in 2011),' Martin told Cincinnati. The teen was taken out of Voigt's class after his parents complained. Four students interviewed by the school complied with the victim's story. Voigt believes he was misquoted by the student who he said caused trouble in class. 'We intend to uphold board policies and to hold teachers accountable for the essential functions of the teacher job description,' Martin said. 'Obviously we’re very disheartened to have this situation with any of our staff members, Superintendent Paul Otten said. 'It’s not something we’re proud of, and it’s something we must not tolerate,' Martin told The Dayton Daily News. Fairfield Freshman High School does not tolerate Voigt's behavior so they have suspended him without pay .","Teacher Gil Voigt has been suspended without pay and may be terminated from Fairfield Freshman High School .

"A concert pianist had demanded that a review of a 2010 concert he gave be removed from internet search results under the European 'right to be forgotten' law. Dejan Lazic, a performer from Croatia, said that a 'defamatory' review of his performance in Washington, D.C. should not appear alongside Google searches for his name because it is 'opinionated' and 'mean-spirited'. Lazic wrote to the Washington Post, which published the review by classical music writer Anne Midgette, to have the article removed from search results. Complaint: Dejan Lazic, a Croatian concert pianist, demanded that the Washington Post remove a review of a concert he gave four years ago from search results . He called the review: 'Defamatory, mean-spirited, opinionated, one-sided, offensive [and] simply irrelevant for the arts' - despite the fact that the original piece is in many places complimentary. In the original article, Midgette said that his performance was lackluster given his huge talents, and prone to 'grandiloquence'. She wrote: 'It's not that Lazic isn't sensitive - or profoundly gifted... The sheer technical ability was, at first, a delight. 'Soon, though, all of the finesse started to seem like an end in itself... There were fine moments, but they stubbornly refused to add up to anything more than a self-conscious display of Fine Moments.' Lazic insisted that his request was 'nothing to do with censorship', but a response to the fact that newspaper reviews are 'too far from the truth'. 'Defamed': Lazic - who denies he is trying to censor his history - said the review was 'mean-spirited' and 'opinionated' He was attempting to invoke a European Union law which regulates search engines and lets EU citizens request to have links removed from search results if the information is deemed 'inadequate, irrelevant or… excessive.' However, the request was misplaced as search engines themselves, not publishers, enact the law. The Post said the request was a 'troubling' example of the rules in action. The request was the first the Washington Post has ever received, according to the publisher. Lazic insisted his request 'has nothing to do with censorship', but complained that he thinks reviews are usually 'too far from the truth'. Search engines - chiefly Google - fought the ruling in the European courts, but was forced to comply and has removed links to outlets including the BBC, the Telegraph and the MailOnline. Since then thousands of articles have been removed from hundreds of publishers, which received a notification that their pages will no longer appear on European versions of search engine sites. In some cases the complaints have been made not be the primary subject of an article but by those mentioned in passing, or even people who have left comments underneath stories which they want hidden.","Dejan Lazic, a Croatian performer, demanded the Post remove the article .

"The powers of recovery which have helped keep Kell Brook undefeated through more than 30 professional fights on his climb to world champion status have been revealed as even more special by the announcement that he will return to the ring on March 28. Brook needed 34 staples in a deep, vicious leg-wound after being stabbed on holiday following his winning of the IBF world welterweight belt from America's Shawn Porter. There were fears that the injury might be career-threatening, but Brook will be ready in just nine weeks to defend that title in his home town of Sheffield - Special K indeed. Kell Brook will return to the ring on March 28 after he was stabbed in the leg while on holiday in Tenerife . Brook said he was the 'victim of an unprovoked attack' when on holiday in Tenerife in September . His challenger will be named this Thursday and is expected to one of two Canadian-based boxers, No 1 contender Jo Jo Dan or the more lowly ranked Andonin Decarie. A statement from Brook's promoter, Matchroom, read: 'Kell Brook will make the first defence of his IBF World Welterweight title on March 28 at the Motorpoint Arena in Sheffield.' Brook improved his career record to 33-0 when he beat Porter by majority decision in California, but less than a month later, he was in hospital after an incident that left him fearing for his career and even his life. The 28-year-old said he was the 'victim of an unprovoked attack' in the early hours of September 4, when a conversation between himself and his attacker in the assailant's apartment, following an evening of drinking, turned sour. Brook won the IBF world welterweight title when he beat Shawn Porter in Los Angeles in August . Brook will defend his world title against an opponent that has not yet been named in Sheffield . Brook lost a lot of blood and had no feeling in the affected area, but has recovered sufficiently to line up a title defence. He was aiming high in terms of opponents as he began the recovery process, claiming: 'Believe me, I will get better and then I'll smash Amir Khan. 'The dream scenario would then be to fight Floyd Mayweather. I'm a young lion and I believe I can be one of the greats.' Kell Brook's first world title defence will be televised live on Sky Sports on March 28.","Kell Brook will return to the ring for the first time since being stabbed .

"Vince Cable slapped down one of his civil service aides over the tweet claiming Evans was 'probably not guilty' Business Secretary Vince Cable has been forced to rebuke one of his top Whitehall aides for claiming Ched Evans was 'probably not guilty' of rape - despite the footballer being tried and convicted for the crime. Andy Ormerod-Cloke, Private Secretary to the Business Secretary, made the controversial remark on his personal Twitter account while watching BBC One's Question Time last night. The Oxford University graduate, said he would 'query how many have looked at the details rather than symbolism of rapist-footballer'. He added: 'If guilty then never a footballer again – role model argument – but on the facts of the case, probably not guilty.' As a civil servant Mr Ormerod-Cloke is not supposed to post messages online about controversial topics. Official guidance states: 'We should avoid commenting altogether on politically controversial issues and avoid making any kind of personal attack or tasteless or offensive remarks to individuals or groups.' In April 2012, Evans was jailed for five years for raping a 19-year-old before being released last year. A spokeswoman for Vince Cable said: 'The member of staff regrets his actions and has apologised. We now consider the matter closed.' Mr Ormerod-Cloke's remarks, reported in the Telegraph, emerged as Evans hit out at the 'mob' for scuppering his deal to sign for Oldham Athletic. The disgraced striker, 26, claimed pressure from 'radical elements' meant a new stand at Oldham and several jobs would have been put at risk if had he joined. It came as the head of the Professional Footballers' Association Gordon Taylor was forced to apologise after he compared the plight of the convicted rapist to the 96 victims of the Hillsborough disaster. Yesterday Evans apologised to the woman he raped for the first time but maintained he is 'innocent' of attacking her in a Rhyl hotel room in 2011 and said he will appeal the conviction. Ched Evans, pictured holding hands with his fiancee Natasha yesterday, has apologised to his rape victim for the first time but has maintained he is innocent . And in an attack on those who opposed his return to football with Oldham said: 'Sadly the 'mob rule' tactics employed by the more radical elements of our society and the constant media reporting has had the desired influence on some sponsors and the club would face significant financial pressure if I joined them. 'The most significant issue for me was that owing to the threat of funding opportunities being withdrawn which may jeopardise the building of Oldham's new stand, it would mean that workers would lose their jobs and others would be put at risk - that would simply not be fair.' Meanwhile Gordon Taylor, chief executive of the PFA, sparked outrage after making the 'insensitive parallel' in a Radio 5 Live interview following the announcement that Evans' move to Oldham had collapsed. Mr Taylor, 70, told BBC Radio 5 Live: 'He would not be the first person or persons to have been found guilty and maintained their innocence and then been proved right. Gordon Taylor, chief executive of the PFA, is facing calls to resign after comparing the plight of convicted rapist Ched Evans to  Hillsborough . 'If we are talking about things in football we know what happened, what was alleged to have happened at Hillsborough and it's now unravelling and we are finding it was very different to how it was portrayed at the time. Indeed by the police at the time.' His comments, comparing the problems faced by convicted rapist Evans sparked calls for him to resign. Responding he said: 'The last thing I intended to do was to upset anybody connected with the Hillsborough case because I've long been a supporter of them . 'So if that's the impression they got it's a totally wrong one and I'm very sorry for that and that's not at all what I intended. 'I was intending to show it as a campaign to prove the reality of what happened and how determined they'd been and how much I admired them. Ched Evans is a totally different case but he has the same belief in his innocence.' Mr Taylor said it appeared 'very doubtful' Evans would play football in this country again. 'At this moment in time you would have to say you would be very doubtful of that,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today. 'It may well be that he would have to go abroad but at the moment, because he is out on licence he can't go abroad. 'So we need a serious rethink now after the way that this has divided opinion.' The union boss said the former Wales and Sheffield United striker is in a 'very difficult situation' which has been made worse by Oldham Athletic's decision to scrap a deal to sign him. He said: 'He's been put through a wringer and the moment you show any sympathy for Ched, everybody will say, 'what about the other parties concerned', and that's why I'm making the point that nobody's forgetting them.","Andy Ormerod-Cloke made the controversial remark on Twitter .

"A Libyan man had a shock when he returned to his car after seeking shelter from shelling.

Dangerously close: A live mortar shell that struck a car in Benghazi, Libya, became wedged in the bodywork instead of exploding . But instead of exploding, the live mortar shell punched a hole in the bodywork and stopped when it hit the rubber tire. He said: 'I ran off when I saw it and shouted to everyone to keep away, but after half a day when it was still there and hadn't exploded, I went back and took a snap.' But the un-exploded mortar is reportedly still wedged in car because for the moment it's too dangerous to remove, according to Mr Kassis who posted these images online. This weekend, deadly fighting between Islamist militias and forces backed by Libya's internationally recognised government forced the closure of an airport in eastern Tripoli, military sources said. Close call: Fawwaz Qasim Kassis risked his life to take the snap of the grenade, which struck the car on hatch to the petrol tank . At least four people were killed and ten wounded in clashes between the Islamist Fajr Libya (Libya Dawn) and fighters loyal to the government around the Mitiga air base, the sources said. An airport official said that Mitiga was closed to air traffic due to the violence. Libyan carriers moved civilian flights to Mitiga after Tripoli's main international airport was damaged by fierce fighting between state-backed fighters and Islamist militias in July. More than three years after dictator Muammar Gaddafi was toppled and killed in a NATO-backed revolt, Libya is awash with weapons and powerful militias, and run by rival governments and parliaments.","Libyan man finds live mortar shell in his car after shelling in Benghazi .

"The problem for Brendan Rodgers is that he does not talk a very good game. Not in front of the media. No matter how strategically astute and psychologically persuasive he may be in the Liverpool dressing room, he comes across as dreadfully insecure in his public utterances. The desperation for professional respect is matched by an aching desire to be liked. Loved, even. Brendan Rodgers gets his point across as Liverpool train ahead of the FA Cup clash with Bolton this week . Rodgers also had plenty to say after watching his side draw 1-1 with Chelsea in the League Cup in midweek . Hence, under interview, the mouth has a tendency to open before the mind has become fully engaged. The frantic leaps to the defence of the indefensible, take Luis Suarez , the glaring-eyed insistence that his team have played well when it is manifest to most observers that they have not, the trumpeting of his own tactical cleverness – all betray that anxious personality trait. They delve below the basic precept of a manager defending his players, deep into his own awkward psyche. Nor is he simply saying what he supposes the Anfield faithful want to hear. Fiercely supportive though the residents of the Kop may be when anyone outside the red brethren dares to criticise, they are shrewd and analytical when debating their team and manager among themselves. To be fair to Rodgers, his side outplayed Chelsea at Anfield with Raheem Sterling (left) scoring for the hosts . But the end result was a 1-1 draw and the Reds face a test in next week's second leg at Stamford Bridge . This is not even as basic as a runaway ego-trip, even though there may be a certain arrogance involved. What Rodgers seems utterly unable to grasp is that, often, less is more. Tuesday night was a classic example of when he would have been better letting his team do the talking. We had all watched as they soared above their recent performance level to give Chelsea a good old-fashioned Liverpool chasing in the first leg of their Capital One semi-final. It would have been enough for Rodgers to say they were unlucky not to win and that if they play like this again they have a good chance of coming away from the return at Stamford Bridge clutching a ticket to Wembley. Not our Brendan. He kept banging on about how wonderful they had been, how brilliantly he and they had run Chelsea ragged, that they are back to the form which can win any and every trophy this season. Or words to that effect. Luis Suarez always had the full backing of Rodgers during the striker's time at Anfield . So forcibly did he ram it down our throats that we barely had time to open our own mouths in praise of Liverpool. By the time we could get a word out others were reminding us that the score was only 1-1, after all. If this was not in character, we might have supposed that it was the presence of Jose Mourinho in the opposite dugout which had made his tongue run away with him. Can the gift of the gab rub off even more on an Irishman, from either side of the border? Well, Mourinho is one of football’s most animated talkers in front of a camera and the style may well have been somewhat contagious. The difference is that when Mourinho speaks there is a invariably a purpose behind what he has to say. Be it to play mind games with rival managers, unsettle opposing players, galvanise his own team, affect the thinking of a referee or even disarm the fans of other clubs. Is there some self-importance involved? Of course. But with Rodgers, whether he realises it or not, it seems to be even more about himself. At least, on air. Those from within would assure us that this appearance is deceptive. Rodgers and Liverpool will wave captain Steven Gerrard off at the end of the season . Even Steven Gerrard – whose dropping from the last grand European occasion of his career Rodgers handled so clumsily – still insists that as a flexible coach and motivational man manager his boss is ‘phenomenal’ and ‘blows me away.’ Presumably, although Gerrard is being allowed to leave Anfield for Los Angeles at the end of this season, that last remark is not to be taken literally. It may be of some help to Rodgers to recount how the most beloved of all Liverpool managers also became the one with the most unforgettably brilliant one-liners. Gerrard, taking a break during Thursday's session at Melwood, describes Rodgers as phenomenal . The sayings of Bill Shankly are legend and the manner in which he delivered one of them makes it a favourite of mine. George Best had just torn Liverpool apart to inspire a Manchester United success at Anfield and Shanks was holding court as usual in the tunnel outside the Boot Room. After some shuffling of feet someone ventured: ‘Well, Bill, what did you think of Best?’ There was a prolonged silence as Shankly bit on the knuckle of his right forefinger, as was his habit, and pondered the question. Finally he answered: ‘Aye, wee Georgie. He’s the deepest tackler in the game.’ Shankly had assumed that anyone with so much as a modicum of knowledge about football would know they had just seen a genius at work. So he doffed his cap to the physical courage which enabled Best to defy the most rugged of opposing defenders so as to deliver performances like that. With those few words he implied sympathy for his own players in trying to cope with Best at his greatest, while taking nothing away from United. If Sterling turns on the style again, we won't need Rodgers to tell us how good Liverpool can be . Shankly had also mastered the art of knowing when to speak with tongue in cheek. As has Mourinho. Neither would have blurted out the risible remark which ranks as the most foolish spoken by Rodgers in praise of Suarez – as well as in defence of his own reluctance to condemn the unspeakable behaviour with which the fang-man blighted his talent as a goalscorer. When Suarez was voted Footballer of the Year – mistakenly in my view since the historic Football Writers’ Award is supposed to be bestowed for exemplary conduct as well exceptional performance – Rodgers accepted the award on behalf of his absent player by saying: ‘I am a better person for knowing Luis Suarez.’ Not all the laughter in that banqueting hall was successfully stifled. Rodgers is clearly a clever coach, one refreshingly willing to alter and adapt his tactics, deeply passionate about the game, honoured to have this job at Liverpool and by all accounts a rousing man manager. But it is for the rest of us, not for him, to say so. Bobby Moore was one of the greatest defenders of all time - man of the match in the 1966 World Cup final at Wembley - and remains the only England captain ever to raise that trophy aloft. So let me advise Rodgers, also, of what Moore had to say whenever he was asked about his fame: ‘If you’re quite good at something, you don’t have to tell anyone.’","Rodgers comes across as dreadfully insecure in his public utterances .

"Anno Domini 2015 has dawned glittering with the prospect of more brilliant fights than for many a New Year. A seismic shift in boxing politics, one stretching from this side of the Atlantic to the other, has raised real hope that Floyd Mayweather versus Manny Pacquiao will be but one of several long-awaited fights which will make their way through the ropes in the coming 12 months. Pressure from not only the public but some of the most respected figures in the game is compelling the rival tycoons of the ring to do business with each other for the benefit of the fans, the fighters and boxing itself. Floyd Mayweather (left) may finally face Manny Pacquiao in the ring in 2015 . Mayweather (left) eyes up Marcos Maidana during his fight with the Argentine in Las Vegas last September . Pacquiao (right) trades blows with Timothy Bradley during the pair's bout in Las Vegas last April . Our own Lennox Lewis, still the last undisputed heavyweight champion of the world, speaks for us all when he says: 'Let's stop all the nonsense and make this fight happen.' He was referring to the Mayweather-Pacquiao saga in particular but that sentiment applies to any number of important bouts which have been blocked by the self-interest of rival promoters and television moguls often to the detriment of the game. At last, the barriers are coming down. The Golden Boy himself, Oscar De La Hoya, has led the way by reaching out to make the peace with his company's fiercest rival, Bob Arum. Oscar De La Hoya (left) has made peace with his company's fiercest rival Bob Arum (right) Fights between members of these opposing stables began taking place before Christmas. For breaking down this barrier, as well as beating his addictions to drink and drugs, De La Hoya was named 'Promoter of 2014' by Sports Illustrated. Now De La Hoya and Arum's Top Rank are deep in talks for Canelo Alvarez and Miguel Cotto to meet in a spring mega-fight. More immediately, De La Hoya is co-promoting the first fight of major import in 2014 with old foe Don King. Former heavyweight champion of the world Lennox Lewis has called for a Mayweather-Pacquiao bout . Here is a mouth-watering list of just some of the spectaculars we can expect to see in 2015 . SCHEDULED ALREADY . January 17 - Bermane Stiverne v Deontay Wilder, WBC world heavyweight title (Las Vegas) January 31 - Anthony Joshua and Kevin Mitchell in world title eliminators (02 Arena London) February 21 - Arthur Abraham v Paul Smith, WBO world super-middleweight title rematch (Berlin); Gennady Golovkin v Martin Murray, WBO world middleweight title (Monaco) February 28 - Carl Frampton v Chris Avalos, IBF world super-bantamweight title (Belfast); Tyson Fury and Chris Eubank Jnr in world title eliminators (02 Arena London) March 6 – Paul Butler v Zolani Tete, IBF world super-featherweight title (Echo Arena Liverpool) April 4 – Wladimir Klitschko v Bryant Jennings or Wilder (Barclays Center, New York) IN THE OFFING: WORLD TITLE FIGHTS . Floyd Mayweather v Manny Pacquaio. Then the winner v Amir Khan . Kell Brook v Khan . Andy Lee v Billy Joe Saunders . Miguel Cotto v Canelo Alvarez . Carl Froch v Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr . Sergy Kovalev v Adonis Stevenson . Klitschko v Wilder, then Fury . Carl Frampton v Scott Quigg, Leo Santa Cruz . Anthony Dirrell v James DeGale . Golovkin v Juan Manuel Marquez . OTHERS . Joshua v David Haye or David Price . DeGale v George Groves (rematch) Deontay Wilder, De La Hoya's great hope to end America's world heavyweight champion drought, challenges King's man Bermane Stiverne for the WBC title in Las Vegas in a fortnight. As the facilitating promoter for Mayweather's company in his recent fights, De La Hoya is also doing what he can to finally bring the Money Man and the PacMan together for the richest fight in ring history. Although he would have a stronger financial stake in Amir Khan fighting Mayweather – which he proclaims as the best alternative, De La Hoya says: 'As a boxing fan first and foremost I understand completely that Floyd versus Manny is the fight all of us most want to see. It has to happen soon, for the good of boxing.' The major obstacle, Mayweather's prevarications notwithstanding, is the stand-off between the two major US cable television networks. Mayweather Is contracted to Showtime; Pacquiao to HBO. Lewis challenges them to collaborate: 'Both of them put my fight with Mike Tyson on pay-per-view and shared more than two million buys between them. I see no reason why they shouldn't do the same for a fight as huge as Mayweather v Pacquiao which would attract an even bigger audience.' Nor does anyone else outside those board-rooms. Meanwhile, a variation on the TV theme has exposed as a myth what appeared to be another of the monopolies which has handicapped British boxing down the decades. Khan's scintillating performances in Las Vegas against Americans Luis Collazo and Devon Alexander were of importance beyond their impact on the Mayweather Sweepstakes. The first was screened in this country on BoxNation by Frank Warren, who in the process of expanding his TV business is putting the quality of broadcast fights above the vested interest of his own promotions. When Team Khan negotiated for the second to be on Sky, they excluded the promoter who was widely believed to hold the exclusive rights to put on all that station's boxing broadcasts. By proceeding without Eddie Hearn, Sky opened the door to a world of alternative possibilities. Although Hearn put on a magnificent production by filling Wembley Stadium with 80,000 fans for Carl Froch's rematch with George Groves and spreading the boxing gospel to a far wider cross-over audience which includes a younger generation, this has to be healthier. Amir Khan (right) could potentially face the winner of the proposed Mayweather and Pacquiao bout . For example, equal co-operation between Hearn's Matchroom company and Barry McGuigan's Cyclone operation in Belfast would increase the chances of Scott Quigg and Carl Frampton meeting in a much-wanted Battle of Britain for the unified world super-bantamweight championship. Perhaps it could happen after one of them has put down the threat from America's rival belt-holder Leo Santa Cruz. Sky's willingness to work with Khan Promotions should simplify the making of a deal with Hearn for a fall-back fight with Kell Brook at Wembley Stadium, should Khan fail to pin down Mayweather and/or Pacquiao. Open competition is the essence of sport and that needs to apply not only to boxers but to their paymasters.

"A colourful wall dedicated to the memory of John Lennon has been painted over, leaving just a single message: “Wall is over!” The wall, in Prague, began to be painted with Lennon’s images and related graffiti after the Beatle’s assassination in 1980. Under the communist regime, it became a symbol of freedom and opposition to communism and young people used to meet there to light candles and lay flowers. A group of art students claimed responsibility for painting the wall white on Monday and leaving the message, an apparent play on the words of the Lennon hit “Happy Xmas (War is Over) How the famous Lennon Wall in Prague, Czech Republic, used to look before it was painted white . After the 1989 anti-communist Velvet Revolution, it turned into a tourist attraction. Recently, messages in support of democracy protests in Hong Kong appeared on the wall, while another Lennon wall sprang up in Hong Kong itself. On Monday the wall, in the Czech capital's Little Quarter, was painted white apart from the message, a play on the words of the Lennon hit “Happy Xmas (War is Over).” A group of art students claimed responsibility, saying they did it to mark the 25th anniversary of the Velvet Revolution. The wall, located at the heart of the Czech capital began to be painted with Lennon’s images and related graffiti after the Beatle’s assassination in 1980 . One of the students, Jan Dotrel, stressed on Facebook they did not mean to commit an act of vandalism but that it was “an art project.” Czech public television reported  that the wall’s owner, the Sovereign Order of Malta, is taking legal action. New messages, including “The wall is never over” immediately began to appear there. It was not the first time the wall had been painted over. Communist authorities did it several times to stop unwelcome adoration of a Western musician and activities considered dangerous to the totalitarian regime. Another art group painted the wall green in 2000.","Wall in Prague began to be painted after Beatle's assassination in 1980 .

"While most Christmas cards might have a pretty picture of a church in the snow, Santa on his sleigh or another suitable festive scene, the same can’t be said for this one sent out by council officials. The ‘insulting’ card was sent to social housing tenants in 17,000 properties by Hammersmith and Fulham Council in West London, reminding them to avoid ‘overindulging’ and to pay their rent. It shows a pound coin fizzing in a glass of water like a tablet, with a picture of holly and ivy - and the slogan ‘Don't overindulge this Christmas. Pay your rent!’. Greeting: An 'insulting' card was sent to social housing tenants in 17,000 properties by Hammersmith and Fulham Council in West London, reminding them to avoid 'overindulging' and to pay their rent . The council also printed a message underneath the image saying ‘If you are having trouble paying your rent, we want to help', before including a telephone number with which to contact them. But Tina Buckley, 43, who has lived in a council property with her 82-year-old mother Mary for 25 years, said the card made her angry because they have never been behind with their rent. She told BBC London: ‘When we were young and there wasn't much money, she would pay her rent before she would feed us and clothe us and heat the house. ‘Keeping the roof over our head was more important than anything else so to get this disgusting, threatening piece of literature masquerading as a Christmas greeting, it's insulting.’ Defence: Hammersmith and Fulham Council it has to 'take all reasonable steps possible to make sure people pay their rent'. Hammersmith Town Hall in West London is pictured . However, the council said the cards - which cost around £2,000 to produce - formed part of a ‘hard-hitting’ campaign that was required because 46 per cent of its tenants were in rent arrears. 'To get this disgusting, threatening piece of literature masquerading as a Christmas greeting, it's insulting' Tina Buckley, resident . A council spokesman said: ‘The real issue was to say if you are in difficulty give us a call. I think we've got to take all reasonable steps possible to make sure people pay their rent.’ A similar card was sent out by housing association Derwent Living to tenants in 1,000 homes in Derby earlier this month, saying: 'There’s no break from paying your rent this Christmas.

"Swimmers at one of Australia’s most famous beaches were in shock this morning after a 2.5 metre great white shark was  caught in nets at Bondi Beach. The shark is thought to have died in the nets and was picked up by a contractor boat on behalf of the Fisheries department at around 11.30 am on Wednesday. It was taken from Bondi to the Fisheries wharf in Sydney harbour where it was unloaded into a container to be taken for testing and an autopsy. Photos taken by a witness on a nearby boat show the shark, hung from its mouth, being winched in the air by men in hard hats and high-vis jackets at the wharf. Scroll down for video . A 2.5 metre great white shark was caught in nets at Bondi Beach . A spokesperson for the Department of Primary Industries told Daily Mail Australia: ‘A male great white shark of approximately 2.5m in length was found in a shark net off Bondi Beach.’ ‘The shark was found during routine inspections by specialist contractors who carry out operations as part of the NSW Shark Meshing Program,’ the Department confirmed. ‘DPI research staff will conduct a necropsy (or autopsy) for research purposes, as is practice for some sharks caught in our shark nets as part of national and international research projects. This will be carried out by DPI research staff.’ Witness Nick Wenham told Daily Mail Australia: ‘It was definitely from Bondi beach. It's a 2.5-3m great white that needed to be taken to the Fisheries for testing because it's a protected species.' The shark is thought to have died in the nets and was picked up by a Fisheries department boat . 'The shark was found during routine inspections,' the Department confirmed . Shark nets are on 51 beaches in New South Wales and are maintained by the Department of Primary Industries . ‘It was dead with its tail removed. We followed the boat from Bradley's head in the harbour up to the fisheries where I took the pictures. ‘The shark went into the container behind and they shut the doors as soon as it was in,’ Mr Wenham added. 'The tail was on the back deck,' he pointed out. Michael Kennedy, director of the Humane Society International Australia, said shark nets ‘are old fashioned and cruel and should be to be taken out’. A dog onboard the boat inspected the dead great white . Animal welfare campaigners believe shark nets are cruel and inhumane . 'DPI research staff will conduct a necropsy (or autopsy) for research purposes,' a Department spokesperson said . ‘In theory if it is alive they are supposed to release them but if it died it should be used for research so it didn’t die in vain,’ he told Daily Mail Australia. ‘Groups like ours are totally opposed to shark nets … research recognises that they are a key threat to a whole range of species… but they are scared of what would happen if they are remove the nets,’ Mr Kennedy said. ‘Even people whose sons and parents have been killed in the surf don’t want revenge killings … I think that is the attitude today in Australia.' Shark nets are on 51 beaches in New South Wales and are maintained by the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries. The nets are generally 150 metres long and 6m wide and can be established 500 metres from the beach. ‘The program protects around two million people who swim at these beaches each year,’ a Department spokesperson said. ‘The nets do not stretch from one end of a beach to the other. They are not designed to create a total barrier between bathers and sharks. They are designed to deter sharks from establishing territories, thereby reducing the odds of a shark encounter,’ they added. Bondi Beach, in Sydney's east, features an underwater shark net shared during the summer months .

"Carl Froch is poised to fulfil two lifelong ambitions by fighting Bernard Hopkins at Nottingham Forest’s City Ground this June and Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr in Las Vegas in the autumn. The Cobra is expected to relinquish his IBF supermiddleweight belt on Tuesday, allowing negotiations to be finalised for two defences of his WBA world championship. Carl Froch is set to vacate his IBF world title having not fought since beating George Groves last May . Froch had been due to face Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr in March but had to withdraw with an injury . That decision also clears the way for James DeGale to fight for the vacant IBF title. Froch, at 37, intends bringing his career to a climax with the two fights. Both Hopkins, the 50-year-old phenomenon of the ring, and Chavez, same-name son of the legendary Mexican fighter, are willing to meet him. Froch had always hoped to fight at the City Ground and has come to cherish the prospect of boxing in Vegas before hanging up his gloves. The chance of doing both has convinced him to vacate the IBF title, which he would have been required to defend against DeGale in April. Froch feels he has nothing to prove against younger domestic rivals following two victories over George Groves. James DeGale (left) is the mandatory challenger for the IBF title and is set to fight for it at the O2 in April . DeGale (right) earned the No 1 spot by stopping Brandon Gonzales in impressive fashion at Wembley . DeGale lost a contentious decision to Groves in 2011 and a rematch seems inevitable in the future . Both fights were deemed mandatory defences by the IBF, though Groves was not the leading contender. Froch says: ‘I’m not going to be rail-roaded into doing the same against DeGale, who would need at least another fight or two against quality opposition before being ready for me.’ The alternatives for DeGale will be detailed this morning by promoter Eddie Hearn. DeGale, his own chance of glory finally at hand, and Andre Dirrell, the American cancer survivor, are the mandatory rivals for the IBF title about to fall vacant. Hearn is keen to put that on at London’s O2 Arena on April 25. But Dirrell is reluctant to return to England. He feels he was robbed of the decision in a close fight with Froch In Nottingham. Unless Dirrell can raise the financial stakes to take the fight to America, DeGale will need another contender. A return with Groves, who beat him in their first match, would be big box-office here, but Groves is pursuing his mandatory world-title challenge to Dirrell’s brother, Anthony, the WBC champion. George Groves looked less than impressive against Dennis Douglin in Liverpool last November . Groves is the mandatory challenger for the WBC super-middleweight title held by Anthony Dirrell . One of Carl Froch’s bravest and most honourable rivals, Mikkel Kessler, is calling it a career after being left out of the current super-middleweight world title loop. The Viking Warrior, who turns 37 himself shortly, hoped for a last hurrah against either Froch or the stand-out for latterly inactive champion Andre Ward. Kessler was seeking either a rubber match with Froch – their series stands at one win each – or the chance to avenge defeat by Ward. Mikkel Kessler beat Froch via unanimous decision in 2010 but lost the rematch on points in 2013 . He says: ‘Since neither wanted it I’m in a state of retirement. I was approached about James DeGale or George Groves but I’m not interested. Only a big fight against a big name would have given me the motivation to get back into full-out training.’ Kessler bows out with a record of 36 wins against only three defeats. The other loss was against Joe Calzaghe on a memorable world championship night in Cardiff. He goes with enormous respect, not only in Denmark where his a folk hero but throughout the wide world of boxing. The final bell tolled at the weekend for a friend not only of boxing but of virtually everyone in the hard old game . Cedric Kushner climbed out of shoe-shining poverty in South Africa to become a true gentleman of a promoter in the midst of the rough and tumble of boxing in New York, . With his unfailing good manners and acquired cut-glass English accent, Kushner charmed us all while taking kindly and generous care of the careers of such notables as Sugar Shane Mosley. Cedric Kushner was the popular promoter of Hasim Rahman and Sugar Shane Mosley . The zenith of his career came in South Africa in 2001, at the temporary expense of our own Lennox Lewis. Kushner’s big man Hasim Rahman pulled off the shock KO of Lewis to give him his only promotional share in the winning of the world heavyweight title. The satisfaction was short-lived. Electric-haired promoter Don King arrived in Johannesburg bearing a bag full of half-a-million dollars with which to lure Rahman away from Kushner. Lewis was to retrieve the title in the re-match. Kushner went on to win his own battle, against obesity. ‘The elephant in the room is now a greyhound,’ he proudly announced. But the physical strain of it all brought on a massive heart attack, at just 66. The star had dimmed for the man who famously brought boxing to New York’s iconic Hammerstein Ballroom. But as times became harder Cedric was looked after by such as the current leading New York promoter Lou DiBella, fight-loving businessman Jay Wartski and Runyanesque boxing writer-turned-lawyer Michael Marley. None of us will forget the long nights in renowned Manhattan restaurants listening to Cedric tell his colourful life stories. As he would have put it himself: ‘Good night, my dear friend. It honestly has been the most tremendous pleasure.’","Carl Froch set to make an announcement on his future on Tuesday .

Robertson released follow-up statement saying he 'loves all of humanity' but didn't disavow his comments . Duck Dynasty’s Phil Robertson has linked homosexuality to bestiality. The 67-year-old reality TV star has come under fire from gay rights group GLAAD after making the homophobic comments in the January 2014 issue of GQ magazine and it's possible his show could now be at risk. He told the magazine: 'Everything is blurred on what’s right and what’s wrong… Sin becomes fine. Start with homosexual behaviour and just morph out from there. Bestiality, sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men.' Controversial: Duck Dynasty's Phil Robertson (centre) has been slammed by gay rights groups after linking homosexuality to bestiality in a new GQ interview . Phil, who claims to be devoutly Christian, then grouped homosexuals in with terrorists and prostitutes in a paraphrased Bible quote. He said: 'Don’t be deceived. Neither the adulterers, the idolaters, the male prostitutes, the homosexual offenders, the greedy, the drunkards, the slanderers, the swindlers - they won’t inherit the kingdom of God. Don’t deceive yourself. It’s not right.' Phil, who has been married to his wife Kay since 1966, then got even more explicit, stating: 'It seems like, to me, a vagina - as a man - would be more desirable than a man’s anus. That’s just me. I’m just thinking: There’s more there! She’s got more to offer. I mean, come on, dudes! You know what I’m saying? But hey, sin: It’s not logical, my man. It’s just not logical.' GLAAD hit back soon after the interview was released online, calling him a ‘stain’ on the network A&E which airs the show. In jeopardy: Phil's comments (pictured here with wife Kay) could put the family's reality TV show in jeopardy . GLAAD spokesperson Wilson Cruz told E! News: 'Phil and his family claim to be Christian, but Phil's lies about an entire community fly in the face of what true Christians believe. 'He clearly knows nothing about gay people or the majority of Louisianans—and Americans—who support legal recognition for loving and committed gay and lesbian couples. On growing up in pre-civil-rights-era Louisiana'I . never, with my eyes, saw the mistreatment of any black person. Not . once. Where we lived was all farmers. The blacks worked for the farmers. I hoed cotton with them. I'm with the blacks, because we're white . trash. We're going across the field.... They're singing and happy. I . never heard one of them, one black person, say, ""I tell you what: These . doggone white people"" - not a word!... Pre-entitlement, pre-welfare, you . say: Were they happy? They were godly; they were happy; no one was . singing the blues.' On why he voted Romney in 2012'If I'm lost at three o'clock in a major metropolitan area...I ask myself: Where would I rather be trying to walk with my wife and children? One of the guys who's running for president is out of Chicago, Illinois, and the other one is from Salt Lake City, Utah. [Editor's note: Romney is from Boston, not Salt Lake City.] Where would I rather be turned around at three o'clock in the morning? I opted for Salt Lake City. I think it would be safer.'On health insurance'Temporary is all you're going to get with any kind of health care, except the health care I'm telling you about. That's eternal health care, and it's free.... I've opted to go with eternal health care instead of blowing money on these insurance schemes.' 'Phil's decision to push vile and . extreme stereotypes is a stain on A&E and his sponsors who now need . to reexamine their ties to someone with such public disdain for LGBT . people and families.' While A&E have not yet commented, they released a statement from Robertson in which he addressed the controversy. 'I myself am a product of the Sixties', . he said. 'I centred my life around sex, drugs and rock and roll until I . hit rock bottom and accepted Jesus as my Saviour. My mission today is to . go forth and tell people about why I follow Christ and also what the . Bible teaches, and part of that teaching is that women and men are meant . to be together. 'However, I would never treat anyone . with disrespect just because they are different from me. We are all . created by the Almighty and like Him, I love all of humanity. We would . all be better off if we loved God and loved each other.' GQ . also suggested Robertson’s son Jep endorsed his father’s beliefs, when . he said: 'We’re not quite as outspoken as my dad, but I’m definitely in . line. If somebody asks, I tell ’em what the Bible says.' The . recovering alcoholic also opened up on his darkest days, including . fleeing Arkansas in the Seventies after beating up a bar owner and his . wife, something he has never apologised for despite getting sober and . finding Jesus. ‘I didn’t dredge anything back up. I just put it behind . me,’ he said. 'We never, . ever judge someone on who’s going to heaven, hell. That’s the Almighty’s . job. We just love 'em, give 'em the good news about Jesus - whether . they’re homosexuals, drunks, terrorists. We let God sort 'em out later, . you see what I’m saying?' He . also insisted the show won’t last longer than five more years, . explaining:  'Let’s face it. Three, four, five years, we’re out of here. You know what I’m saying? It’s a TV show. This thing ain’t gonna last . forever. No way.' Slammed: Phil (centre with family members Willie and Si) has been slammed by gay rights group GLAAD for his homophobic comments . However, he will never regret signing up for the reality TV show. 'For the sake of the Gospel, it was worth it,’ he said.’ All you have to do is look at any society where there is no Jesus. I’ll give you four: Nazis, no Jesus. Look at their record. Uh, Shintos? They started this thing in Pearl Harbor. Any Jesus among them? None. Communists? None. Islamists? Zero. That’s eighty years of ideologies that have popped up where no Jesus was allowed among those four groups. Just look at the records as far as murder goes among those four groups.' Sharing his father's views? From comments Jep Robertson made in the GQ article it appears he and his father have similar views on homosexuality . The family are multi-millionaires due . to the success of Phil’s  Duck Commander Company, which he formed in . 1973 to sell the duck call he invented a year earlier. He began his business in a dilapidated shed, where he spent quarter of a century making duck calls from Louisiana cedar trees. And it was their third son Willie Robertson, now CEO of the company, who expanded the family business into the multi-million dollar enterprise featured on the hit A&E show. Since its initial air date of March 21, 2012, Duck Dynasty has grown in the ratings for A&E, eventually becoming a ratings hit for the cable network.

"Alex Salmond suffered another painful loss to the Auld Enemy last night after watching Scotland comfortably beaten by bitter rivals England in Glasgow. The First Minister quit as SNP leader after he lost the Scottish Referendum in September and spent the end of his final full day in office with 50,000 other fans at Parkhead last night and watched Roy Hodgson's side win 3-1. Scotland were playing the old enemy on home turf for the first time in 15 years and Mr Salmond and the rest of the Tartan Army had hoped for a victory. But two goals from captain Wayne Rooney and a header by Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was enough to beat Gordon Strachan's side. 5,000 England fans were among the spectators at  Celtic Park to watch the friendly - the oldest fixture in international football. There was a heightened police presence around the stadium, stations and city centre but there were no reports of major fighting between rival fans before, during or after the game, which has been marred by violence in the past. But fans did drown out the respective singing of their national anthems and England supporters were heard singing anti-IRA chants during the match. Scroll down for videos .

Police Scotland reported no football-related disorder in the immediate aftermath of last night's 3-1 victory to England and said they had not received any reports of offensive chants. But in the first half, an FA official contacted the band to ask them to stop playing the tune for the chant. After the game England manager Roy Hodgson said he was unaware of the song but apologised for any offence on behalf of the FA. He said: 'I was aware the crowd were tremendously supportive. I didn't have a clue what they were chanting. 'I don't condone it. If anyone was offended, I'm sure the FA would like to apologise to them. 'All we can do is play our football and be grateful for the support and hopefully they will behave themselves and not get themselves into a situation where their chanting is being criticised.' More than 200 people were arrested in 1999 when England took on Scotland at Hampden Park and police said ahead of the match that they were monitoring 'known troublemakers' from both countries who they believed were planning to attend.

Before the 8pm kick-off there was a minute's applause for Scotland supporter Nathan McSeveney who died at the match. Supporters had mixed views on whether Scotland v England - the oldest fixture in international football - should resume as an annual event. Tartan army member David McCann said: 'You can see from the build-up that it gets everyone interested and it makes a change from the usual boring friendly matches. 'But if it was played every year then I think they'd need to lower the ticket prices.' England supporter James Ward said: 'I'm looking forward to it but I don't think it should be (played) every year, absence makes the heart grow fonder and all that.' The Celtic Park meeting in Glasgow saw the two sides go into the fixture with plenty of confidence, with England having won their last five games and Gordon Strachan's outfit going strong in their Euro 2016 qualifying group.

The Scotland bus pulled up to loud cheers, applause and a rendition of Flower of Scotland from the large crowd that had gathered to see players arrive. Sportsmail's Matt Barlow at Celtic Park said: 'Both teams have been out on the pitch to see a surface without American Football markings. 'England fans are decorating their end with St George flags. 'There are very few Scotland fans inside Celtic Park at the moment, but enough to boo the ceremonial England flag which is being carried out and placed on the pitch. 'Outside is a sombre collection of scarves and flowers and messages in honour of the Scotland supporter Nathan McSeveney, who died at Friday's game against the Republic of Ireland. 'In the programme Gordon Strachan wrote: 'I would like to reiterate on behalf of the squad and my backroom team our deepest condolences to the family and friends of Nathan, who came to support his country and never returned home.' Supporters outside the stadium were split over whether Scotland v England should be a permanent fixture once more. England manager Roy Hodgson was only too happy to have a selfie with the Scotland fans . England teammates Jack Wilshere and James Milner arrive at the stadium prior to kickoff . Michael Kenny, who travelled by train from Preston, said: 'I think it means more to the Scottish fans and team but we obviously want to win.

' The last time the teams met in Scotland there were more than 200 arrests and police said they are monitoring 'known troublemakers' from both countries who they believe are planning to travel to today's game.

"Liz Hodgkinson is now reliant on alcohol and feels as though she needs an evening tipple . On Sunday, I arrived home at around 5pm to be confronted with my worst nightmare: there was no wine in the house. Not a single bottle, anywhere. And I know, because I searched high and low to find one. How on earth would I manage without my evening tipple? I didn't. Even though I'd already had a drink at lunchtime, and even though I'd just driven 50 miles in pouring rain to get home, I got back in the car and drove to the nearest supermarket. There, I picked up a couple of bottles of ready-chilled white wine — and despair and misery instantly turned to happiness. Over the years, as I have hit 50, 60 and now 70, my dependence on alcohol has been steadily growing. At one time I could take it or leave it; but no more. The quantity I consume has also increased. I would once take a bottle of wine to a friend's dinner party, now I always take two. And there doesn't seem as much wine in a bottle as there used to be. When eating out with a friend, we always order a bottle, saying we can take home what we don't finish. But never once has that bottle accompanied us out of the restaurant. A few years ago, I was horrified when, at a dinner party, my sixty-something host and hostess had a bottle of wine each by their plates. But now I do the same. When my friend who drinks only red comes round (I drink only white), we both have a bottle by our plates. The truth is that I, along with most of my sixty-plus women friends, never let a day go by without at least half a bottle of wine to improve it. These days, we are not so much ladies who lunch, as ladies who lurch. So I am not surprised by figures released yesterday revealing a fast-growing number of over-60s seeking help for alcoholism. Research from Public Health England says that 2,276 women over 60 sought professional help for problem drinking in 2013-14, compared with 1,436 five years ago. Serious drinking was once only for men — but somewhere along the line women caught up. Then overtook them. Along with our new, independent, social, self-sufficient lifestyles came the liberating fact that we could drink just like men do. Today, we drink more than our mothers and grandmothers, and in a different way, too. Alcohol is our modern feminist equivalent of a nice cup of cocoa in the evenings, or a Horlicks before bed. And we certainly don't limit ourselves to a dainty sip of wine. Nowadays, we drink as much as we want, whenever we want — and whatever the consequences. The demon drink has certainly got me into some scrapes. Not long ago, friends had to help me into a taxi when they realised I was too drunk to drive home. The next day, I had to catch a train and another taxi to their house, 30 miles away, to retrieve my car. God, the shame of turning up contrite and sober — and with no recollection of the evening before. Then there was the time I fell down unconscious in the street after a party where I just drank and drank, losing all restraint. I was taken to A&E in an ambulance, having hit my head, and kept in hospital until 4pm the next day. To this day, I have no idea who called the ambulance. Once I was so drunk I left my handbag on a bus. Thankfully, the bus stopped just up the road and a woman got out, waving my handbag. Scroll down for video . The quantity she consumes has also increased and she would now take two bottles of wine to a dinner party . It is also true, sadly, that after a few drinks I have been attracted to men I would not give the time of day to when sober. It's not only teenagers who end up in bed with unsuitable men because they are wildly drunk. I have done it, too, even though I'm old enough to know better. I was once staying in a hotel when, after a few too many at the bar, a man — a total stranger — followed me up to my room and knocked on my door. We ended up in bed together. I never saw him again, and was mortified at my behaviour. In recent years, my drinking has spread from an evening pursuit, as it was when I worked full-time, to more of an all-day affair. When I go to the cinema, I usually take half a bottle of wine in. I hardly remember the film the next day, but watching sober has become an impossibility. Ice cream and popcorn just aren't the same. I cannot remember the last time I watched a TV programme sober, either. Downton Abbey, Call The Midwife, Grantchester … all have passed me by in an alcoholic haze. My drinking has been fuelled by the fact that I now have my own 'cellar' — a cupboard in my kitchen fitted out with a wine rack which can be replenished with just a click of a computer mouse on a supermarket website. Online shopping means that as soon as I notice stock running low (which happens with worrying frequency), I can book a home delivery. Goodness knows what happened this weekend! I still can't believe that I'd forgotten to order. She said: 'The truth is that I, along with most of my sixty-plus women friends, never let a day go by without at least half a bottle of wine to improve it' In the past, only men chose wine or ordered it for their cellars. But the internet lets women like me buy booze in secret. I can order an entire case with no one else being any the wiser. There is no one to see me lugging the wine to my car and unloading it at the other end. There isn't even a checkout assistant to give knowing glances. The only tricky part is spiriting the empty bottles out of the house to the recycling bank without too much clanking of glass. And because I live on my own, a 70-year-old divorcee, there is no one around to tell me to stop. But it's not just single women who are drinking more. I know lots of married women whose drinking has increased with age. Some even say they've re-bonded with their husbands over a shared enjoyment of a gin and tonic. That certainly wasn't the way respectable married ladies once behaved. My grandmother might have indulged in a small glass of sherry at Christmas, and my mother enjoyed a bottle of Mackeson's stout with her Sunday lunch. But that was all. It would never have occurred to them to drink any more than that. But then our entire lifestyles are different. My generation has been out in the world: we've held down big jobs, earned our own money, had busy social lives and enjoyed our independence. According to the new research, most elderly problem drinkers are professional women. Having got used to the crutch of alcohol during our working lives, our drinking really takes off when we retire. Armed with good pensions, today's older women can afford to buy wine in more or less unlimited quantities. There are other drivers, too. I live alone and, like many divorcees, sometimes drink to alleviate loneliness and boredom. I seem to reconnect with myself when I drink. While time drags during the day, it speeds by once I'm drinking. Alcohol makes my thoughts come alive. It makes me feel like a human being again, rather than a lost soul wondering what to do. Of course, drinking does sometimes prove dangerous. One close friend drank herself to death after her husband died. Her drinking had gradually escalated until she needed a bottle of vodka to get through the day, and she just wouldn't seek help. But older women trying to cut down rarely succeed. One friend now drinks every other day, rather than every day — but on the days she drinks, she is drinking twice as much as before. At times, I've worried that my own drinking was out of hand. Last Christmas, I cut out wine altogether, just to see if I could. I managed — but only just. And it was sheer, unadulterated hell. I celebrated New Year with a 'mocktail' — a sickly-sweet fruity drink — and for a whole fortnight was crotchety, bad-tempered and sulky. In the end, one of my sons begged me to get back on the wine. After two weeks of self-denial, reuniting with my reliable friend was a heady experience. I was immediately back to half a bottle of wine (at least) a day, even though I promised myself I'd try to keep to just one glass. So, what is my health like after more than 40 years of daily drinking, often to excess? Well, I'm sorry to disappoint any doom-and-gloom merchants, but it's perfect. I'm in much better nick than most 70-year-olds, and when I had medical tests five years ago, I was told I had the innards of a 30-year-old. I do try to minimise health risks by going to the gym every day and watching what I eat. In a way, my whole lifestyle is ordered to accommodate my drinking. I also kid myself that I can keep my drinking within safe limits, even if I am exceeding my self-imposed quota (not to mention the two units a day that the Government recommends women stick to). Indeed, the only problem with my drinking is keeping my wine cellar stocked — and avoiding another late-night supermarket dash.","Liz Hodgkinson is now reliant on alcohol and needs an evening tipple .

"Adel Daoud, 18, is suspected of a terrorist plot to blow up a bar in downtown Chicago . The 18-year-old charged with attempting to detonate what he believed to be a car bomb outside a Chicago bar was a 'immature kid' who is not a danger to the public, his lawyer told a court today. Adel Daoud appeared nervous during his first appearance in federal court, dressed in a bright orange prison jumpsuit and jiggling his legs as he sat. A judge granted the request of Daoud's attorney, Thomas Durkin, to delay his preliminary hearing until Thursday afternoon. At that time, Judge Arlander Keys will rule on whether to allow Daoud to be released on bail. Daoud, a U.S. citizen who lives in the . Chicago suburb of Hillside, was arrested on Friday after trying to . explode a fake bomb provided by an undercover FBI agent as part of a . investigation lasting several months, authorities said. If convicted of attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction, Daoud faces up to life in prison. His attorney has experience as a defense lawyer in terrorist trials, including representing detainees held at Guantanamo Bay. According to an FBI affidavit, Daoud used email accounts starting in October 2011 to gather and send materials 'relating to violent jihad and the killing of Americans'. Two undercover FBI employees began corresponding with Daoud in May, exchanging several electronic messages with him in which he expressed an interest in 'engaging in violent jihad, either in the United States or overseas,' the affidavit said. Nervous: The teenager has appeared in federal court this wek in an orange prison jumpsuit, he was arrested after being monitored by the FBI for months . From late May to mid-June, Daoud sought guidance on whether to carry out an attack in the United States, then sought online resources on how to carry out an attack. An undercover FBI agent then was introduced to Daoud by one of the undercover employees as a cousin and operational terrorist living in New York. An agent . provided Daoud with a Jeep apparently full of explosives - which was . an inert device produced by undercover law enforcement. Daoud was . arrested after allegedly trying to detonate it outside the downtown bar in Chicago. After the hearing on Monday, Durkin . told reporters that he found the case 'somewhat suspicious' and pointed . out that some of the incidents described in the affidavit took place . when Daoud was 17, thus not legally an adult. 'I find it an odd way to enforce the law,' he said. 'I think it's ridiculous.' Durkin . said that the FBI had taken Daoud's glasses, rendering him incapable of . seeing his father Ahmed seated around 15 feet away from him, and asked . for them to be returned. Describing . Daoud as 'socially very awkward' he said 'if the government is to be . believed' the suspect had been spreading 'nonsense' on the Internet. 'Does that make him a terrorist?' he asked with Daoud's father standing behind him. 'I don't know.' Serious: In this courtroom sketch, 18-year-old Adel Daoud, stands before Federal Court Judge Arlander Keys, with attorneys Joss Heiman, left, and Thomas Durikn, as Daoud's father Ahmed Daoud, rear, looks on .

"Scottish MP Jo Swinson believes the 'body shaming' language damages people's confidence . A minister has called for an end to so-called 'fat talk', including terms such as muffin tops, bingo wings and cankles. Scottish MP Jo Swinson believes the 'body shaming' language damages people's confidence and wants women and children to ban the terms from everyday conversation. The equalities minister said: 'It's depressingly commonplace to hear . women - and even young girls and children - insulting their own bodies. 'Muffin tops, thunder thighs, cankles - fat talk and body shaming too . easily become a habit and an expectation.' Her comments - reported in the Sunday Times - come amid high profile campaigns by celebrities. Hunger Games star Jennifer Lawrence last week called for the word fat to be 'illegal to use' on television, and American model Tyra Banks has launched a campaign with the Special K cereal brand to discourage women from using fat talk. The 40-year-old supermodel and America's Top Model judge, who said she uses the term 'fiercely real' instead of 'plus size. She told Huffington Post Style: 'I don't like the label ""plus-size"". 'I . don't want to use the term ""plus-size,"" because, to me, what the hell . is that? It just doesn't have a positive connotation to it. I tend to . not use it.' Research complied by the government has revealed that, regardless of whether they start off fat or thin, women with poor body confidence . are more likely to put on weight. Hunger Games star Jennifer Lawrence last . week called for the word fat to be 'illegal to use' on television, and . model Tyra Banks has launched a campaign with Special K cereal to discourage women from using fat talk . It also found that girls who lack body confidence are less likely to do well at school and work. Future campaigns will now focus on encouraging women to become healthy, rather than solely on losing weight. A government source said: 'Fatshaming, trying to motivate weight loss through self-disgust, is unlikely to produce sustained benefit.' Special K revealed that 93per cent of women .

Swinson has also supported the use of plus-size mannequins on the high street. At the time she said: 'The images we see in the world of fashion are all pretty much the same - it's as if there's only one way of being beautiful. Yet nine in ten people say they would like to see a broader range of body shapes shown in advertising and the media . 'Many customers want to see more realistic images in magazines, TV and on the high street, and having mannequins that reflect and celebrate our diverse society is one way of helping to achieve this.'","Jo Swinson believes 'body shaming' language damages confidence .

"There are characteristics of dogs that particularly ruthless politicians might be happy to possess. Energetic, loyal, aggressive and deadly are just a few comparisons that might flatter a country's leader. But Russian President Vladimir Putin will probably be less than happy when he discovers that one internet user has spotted an eerie resemblance between him and this dog . Scroll down for video . It's the eyes: one Ukrainian internet user noticed the similarity between President Putin and this dog . Kitler: tash the cat, named for its unfortunate facial markings, found fame for resembling Adolf Hitler . The image was posted online by a man from Ukraine, perhaps after noticing the pair's similarly steely stare. Whatever caused him to notice the likeness one thing's for certain, you wouldn't want to be found laughing about it behind the ex-KGB agent's back. The comedy comparison is only the latest episode in the weird saga involving the Russian premier relationship with animals. Animal adventures: Putin has had a long and photogenic relationship with animals, like being pictured in 2010 hunting and riding through the Siberian wilderness just days before his 60th birthday . In one photo opportunity in 2010 the Russian President was seen hunting in Siberia on foot and horseback despite turning 60 that week. Perhaps channeling his inner Iggy Pop he apparently did the whole thing shirtless. Keen to show his softer side, the man who has kept Russia in his grip for the last 13 years also drew a cat's bottom for laughing children while on a school trip. In another bizarre animal-based stunt he flew a microlight aircraft in order to help crane birds navigate a migration route. Larking around: perhaps keen to show his softer side Putin has often been pictured with various animals . In an interview today Putin said that he has not ruled out running in the country's next presidential elections in 2018. If he wins another six year term he will be in place until 2024, meaning he will have lead Russia for the last 24 years, the same length of time as Joseph Stalin. While Putin did step down in 2008 it was only to avoid a constitutional clause forbidding more than two consecutive terms. Instead he handed power to his ally Dmitry Medvedev while he ran operations from the shadows. Medvedev duly increased presidential terms from four to six years, then stepped aside as Putin was reelected in 2012.","One Ukrainian spotted the similarity between these two images .

"A Ukip victory in Thursday's crunch Rochester by-election will spark 'instability and insecurity', David Cameron has warned. The Prime Minister issued the stark warning during a final visit to the Kent constituency today, which looks set to return former Tory Mark Reckless as Ukip's second elected MP. Mr Cameron also refused to deny house prices in the town could tumble if Mr Reckless triumphs for Ukip following 'desperate' warnings from Tory backbench MPs. David Cameron (left) and Conservative Party candidate for Rochester and Strood, Kelly Tolhurst (right), visit MCL Mechanical near Rochester, Kent today . Mr Cameron spoke to Mick Parks, Workshop Foreman at MCL Mechanical, during his fifth and final visit to the Rochester and Strood constituency ahead of the forthcoming by-election later this week . The PM said: 'I'm not a forecaster of house prices but I do know this: The choice at this by-election is between whether to vote for Kelly Tolhurst - a strong, local candidate who backs our economic plan - or to vote Ukip, where you've got instability, insecurity and the danger of Ed Miliband being a step nearer Downing Street.' His remarks came after Charles Walker, the MP for Broxbourne, said on the campaign trail yesterday: 'The danger is if you vote Ukip, the value of your house will go down.' Mr Reckless is odds-on favourite to retain the Rochester and Strood seat he won as a Conservative in 2010 before defecting to the Eurosceptic party and stepping down to force Thursday's contest. The Tories have all but abandoned hope of victory despite Mr Cameron spearheading a massive push to avoid a repeat of the result in Clacton, where defector Douglas Carswell won for Ukip by a large majority. Mr Cameron's visit to the town today is his fifth and final visit ahead of Thursday's contest. A Ukip victory has raised the spectre of further Tory backbenchers transferring their allegiance to Nigel Farage's outfit but the Prime Minister declined to speculate on the implications for a second bruising reverse. Mark Reckless, the former Conservative local MP now standing for Ukip, was out canvasing for votes in Rochester today . Mark Reckless (left) is the favourite to win the Kent seat in Thursday's crunch by-election . Mr Cameron said: 'Between now and Thursday what I'm going to do is focus on this by-election. 'I want the people in Rochester and Strood to have the best possible choice: Kelly Tolhurst, a strong local candidate, living here, working here, born here, raised here, the community absolutely at her heart. 'That's what I'm going to be focusing on. Then let's see what the result is on Thursday and take it from there.' Asked if he was satisfied enough of an effort had been mounted to try to keep hold of the seat, he said: 'I think Kelly has fought a very strong local campaign ... and she has been very strongly backed by the Conservative Party - by Cabinet ministers, ministers - and I think it's absolutely right to do that. 'I believe in leading from the front so I have been keen to come down here five times and to play my part in the campaign. It's the right thing to do. ' He said: 'The only poll that counts, as they say, is the one on polling day. It's quite clear this is a two horse race.' The scale of Mr Cameron's task was underlined by the fact that the boss of the firm he was visiting admitted he had been wavering over whether to end his long history of voting for the Conservatives on Thursday. Ukip supporter Graham Harper (left) with his dog Roque, were out canvassing for support ahead of the election . While he was not prepared to back Ukip yet as their policies were 'not strong enough for me' - Bill Buckley suggested it remained a possibility 'later on down the line' once they had been more tested. 'They've certainly got the public imagination,' the director of MCL Ltd told reporters - citing the issues of immigration and Europe - after showing the PM the heating and ventilation control units being made at the small factory in Upper Halling. He was dismissive of Mr Farage's beer-swilling image, saying he needed to 'turn that down a bit' if he wanted to broaden his appeal, adding: . 'Do you want someone like that running the country?' But he was also critical of all politicians, saying he didn't 'really support any of them' and suggesting 'the whole lot need their heads banging together'. Asked if he was considering switching his vote to Labour, he said: 'To be honest with you I would consider voting for whoever I thought was best for the country. 'I should imagine it will be Conservative if I'm honest.' He said he had been encouraged by what he heard from Mr Cameron about action to force banks to lend, complaining that the refusal of the bank he had used for more than 30 years to provide funds when the firm was hit by the recession and had to shed several posts had seriously delayed its resurgence.","PM issued the stark warning during a final visit to the Kent constituency .

"Rankings of the finest practitioners in sport always carry the heaviest weight at the year’s end. And so, after much deliberation over the turkey and Chrismtas pudding, we come to this column’s listing of the top 10 pound-for-pound boxers in both the world and the United Kingdom in 2014. WORLD RANKINGS . 1) FLOYD MAYWEATHER – still the No 1 man, in the pay-per-view as well as pound-for-pound ratings, despite a non-vintage year compromising two typically proficient, matador-like handlings of Marcos Maidana’s bull-rushes from the Argentinian pampas . 2) MANNY PACQUIAO - back to dazzling form in 2014, first avenging the travesty of last year’s decision gifted to Tim Bradley by the Las Vegas judges, then seeing off new young champion Chris Algieri by the basketball score of 120-102. Time, surely, for the PacMan and Money man to finally get it on in 2015. Floyd Mayweather is still, pound-for-pound, the No 1 fighter in the boxing world at the moment . Manny Pacquiao (right) was back to his dazzling best in 2014, here beating Chris Algieri . 3) GENNADY GOLOVKIN – once the most ducked fighter in the world, now demonstrating why as three more stoppages in 2014 give the Kazakh assassin the highest knock-out percentage in the history of the classic middleweight division. Our own Martin Murray never dodges anyone but he had better duck the biggest of Golovkin’s punches in Monte Carlo on February 21. 4) WLADIMIR KLITSCHKO – credit, please, where credit is due as the Ukraine’s gentleman ambassador to world boxing moves ever close to the longest reign in heavyweight history. 5) ROMAN GONZALEZ – the Nicaraguan sensation may be small but is perfectly formed and can be ignored in these lists no longer, as this current Ring and WBC flyweight champion rides an unblemished record of 41 wins including 35 K0s up through the divisions towards more world titles . Wladimir Klitschko (right) lands a right hand on Alex Leapai to continue his reign as heavyweight champion . Carl Froch celebrates beating George Groves at Wembley in May . 6) GUILLERMO RIGONDEAUX – Cuba’s former amateur superstar continues to gain admiration from the purists, if not the blood-lusters, as the 14 all-win world light-featherweight champion with the WBA, WBO and Ring magazine. 7) JUAN MANUEL MARQUEZ – still, at 41, the Mexican to be reckoned with in the Mayweather-Pacquiao firmament, if his wonky knee does not force him into retirement. 8) CARL FROCH – although Amir Khan is knocking on the top 10 door now, the Nottingham Cobra remains our only presence in the world ratings by virtue of his devastating KO of George Groves in that Wembley Stadium spectacular. And he’s up one place. 9) TIM BRADLEY – has not seemed the same man since Pacquiao took his revenge for that miscarriage of justice – but that is still the only defeat on his record and he clings on at ninth . 10) VASYL LOMACHENKO – the genius amateur from Ukraine rockets into my top 10 after only four pro fights, having won the WBO world featherweight title in the third of those, then commandingly defended it against a 52-1 former world champion from Thailand despite breaking a hand in the third round. Overnight, a star is born. *Andre Ward, who would otherwise have ranked third here, last defended his WBA super-middleweight crown in November 2013 so is excluded due to inactvity throughout 2014. UK RANKINGS . 1) FROCH – see world rankings . 2) AMIR KHAN – two huge away wins over Americans in 2014 – a three knock-down drubbing of Luis Collazo and this month’s dazzling triumph over Devon Alexander without the loss of a round on my card – have reasserted Khan’s place in this list and alongside Mayweather and Pacquiao among the top three welterweights on the planet. Has also shown great courage in going to Pakistan to help finance rebuilding the school where that ghastly massacre took place – after publicly branding extremist Islamic violence ‘a disgrace’ to his religion. Amir Khan lays into Devon Alexander during his excellent victory over the American in Las Vegas . 3) KELL BROOK – until Khan’s master-outclassing of Alexander, Special K was second in my book courtesy of his own big win in the US to take the IBF world welterweight title from the big-punching Shaw Porter. May he enjoy a speedy recovery from being stabbed while on holiday after that gutsy performance. 4) CARL FRAMPTON – the Belfast Jackal turned huge potential into a world super-bantamweight title with his victory over Kiko Martinez. The dramatic setting was the Titanic Quarter in the home city where, like his legendary mentor Barry McGuigan, he is building bridges across the religious divide . 5) JAMES DeGALE – delivering, at last, on his Olympic gold medal fame and looks to have edged just ahead of his bitter London foe Groves in the super-middleweight line of succession to Froch. Kell Brook sticks a right on Shawn Porter during his seismic victory in Los Angeles in August . 6) GEORGE GROVES – has looked a trifle vulnerable in his two fights since being struck down by Froch at Wembley – perhaps having got back in the saddle too quickly after that concussive fall. But has the world-class ability to recover, perhaps in a classic rematch with DeGale . 7) SCOTT QUIGG – continues to grow into his status as WBA ‘regular’ world champion and is itching to establish bragging rights over Frampton in a unification Battle of Britain, hopefully in 2015. 8) OLA AFOLABI – has not fought in his native Britain since blitzing Enzo Maccarinelli back in 2009 but his on-going campaign in America and Germany has survived a tough trilogy with WBO cruiserweight king Marco Huck – one draw, two narrow defeats – and not only brought him the IBO belt but also set-up big unification matches in the new year . George Groves (right) is on the floor in his second Wembley fight against Froch in May . 9) MARTIN MURRAY – still the tough bench-mark for all UK middleweights with only one loss on his record, and that a defeat in Buenos Aires by Argentinian maestro Sergio Martinez which was as debatable as his other world title setback, a draw versus Arthur Abraham in Germany. Will be a huge underdog against Golovkin in Monte Carlo in February but be sure he will put up one helluva fight . 10) JAMIE McDONNELL - in this young man’s case, what goes up may come back down, happily. Having landed his world title by going up to bantamweight to successfully end the Stuart Hall fairytale, is considering an attempt at the rare double of dropping down a division to win at super-featherweight . *Andy Lee, UK-born world middleweight champion thanks to his sensational stoppage of Matt Korobov in Las Vegas, prefers to fight as an Irishman so does not qualify for this list.

"We all have our dreams - even the most famous and successful among us cling to lingering fantasies. Carl Froch, Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather are no exceptions. The prize-ring is the toughest work-place in sport but those notions can still be romantic. CARL FROCH . The Nottingham Cobra admits that winning the world super-middleweight title, climbing into the top 10 in the world pound-for-pound rankings and making history by filling Wembley Stadium for his record-breaking fight with George Groves were all achievements beyond his wildest imagination when he first laced up the gloves. Carl Froch knocks out George Groves to win their super middleweight fight at Wembley . Froch celebrates his victory over Groves - but his dream is to end his career with a fight in Las Vegas . But one last ambition remains and Froch is fighting to make it reality with all the ferocity he musters inside the ropes. The dream is to climax his career by boxing in Las Vegas, the fight capital of the world. As circumstances appeared to be conspiring against him, Froch went gunning for that right. It would have been more convenient – not to mention more enriching – for his promoter Eddie Hearn to match him against stablemate James DeGale in another domestic dust-up. To that end he manoeuvred DeGale into position as mandatory challenger for one of Froch’s world titles. The IBF, to their discredit, have threatened to strip Froch of that title unless he boxes DeGale next. Never mind that he was worn their belt with distinction. Nor that he has made two successive mandatory defences against Groves and morally merits a dispensation from their rules so he can make a voluntary defence or a contest a championship unification bout. To which Froch says: ‘I will happily vacate this title in order to get a fight in Vegas.’ Which is a polite way of telling IBF president Daryl Peoples where to stick his belt unless his organisation – which has a history of corruption, racketeering and being monitored by federal investigators - cuts him some slack. As his promoter’s biggest cash cow, Froch has also warned Hearn that he will retire unless he books him a glamour night on that famous Strip in the Nevada desert. Hearn has duly responded by reopening talks with legendary US promoter Bob Arum for Froch to put his other, WBA belt on the line against Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr in Vegas early in the New Year. Contractually that is not an easy fight to make but Froch is not only grafting to make it happen… but deserves nothing less. MANNY PACQUIAO . The PacMan has risen from poverty in the Philippines to become the only eight-division world champion. He is also an elected politician who fights as fearlessly for his deprived and under-privileged countrymen as he does in the ring. Manny Pacquiao plays basketball for his side KIA-Sorento just a month before a title fight vs Chris Algieri . Pacquiao shoots on court on his dream debut . It is possible he will become president of the Philippines in due course – yet that lofty ambition has not been the fantasy for Pacquiao. Despite being what some would call vertically challenged – at just 5ft 6in tall – he has nursed a long-cherished dream of playing professionally in the sport of bean-stalk giants. If only for a few precious moments. He made that come true on Sunday, even though he is now less than a month away from defending his world welterweight title in a fight he must win if he is ever to meet Mayweather in the richest fight of all time. Pacquiao, a hoops fanatic, bought into the KIA Sorento team in the Philippines Basketball Association. Then he took over some of the coaching duties, while registering himself as a player. Finally, with his usual propriety, he sought dispensation from his Hall of Fame boxing trainer Freddie Roach to take time out for Sunday’s game against Blackwater Elite. For just seven minutes, he became possibly the shortest pro in basketball history. Never mind that he gave the ball away twice. Kia went on to win. And it was practice of sorts for his November 22 collision with undefeated New Yorker Chris Algieri, who is a good four inches the taller. FLOYD MAYWEATHER . The man who calls himself Money has come from the wrong side of the tracks in America to earning more than $50million a fight as the No 1 pound-for-pound boxer on Earth. All the world titles have brought with them the cash to splash with such extravagance as dropping hundred dollar bills on to night club dancefloors in his adopted home city of Las Vegas like so much confetti. That is just one of Mayweather’s many crass displays of wealth. Then there has been the jail time for assaulting the mother of three of his children, followed by a civil action filed against him by another girl friend for similar abuse. Floyd Mayweather (left) looks fully focused during his victory over Marcos Maidana last month . Most recently he has been accused of staging and betting on fights to the finish in his gym, without breaks between rounds. That allegation of dangerous practice has been refuted once but re-opened by a law suit from two of the young boxers who claim to have been involved and damaged. Not much romance there. And yet, and yet… behind all the bling and bravura what Mayweather really, really wants is to go down in history as one of the greatest boxers of all time. He craves that recognition as desperately as many desire true love. He makes that yearning public by wearing a baseball cap emblazoned with the capital initial letter T B E… The Best Ever. Yet he knows in his heart this is not his distinction to bestow. He thinks he might earn it by being the richest prize-fighter ever and preserving his long unbeaten record. Mayweather (front right), wearing a cap proclaiming him to be The Best Ever . But he is to be raised to that lofty pinnacle occupied by Muhammad Ali, Sugar Ray Robinson and Sugar Ray Leonard then he has to do what they did – fight the best out there and take on the chin any defeat which may come his way. In Mayweather’s case that means getting into the ring with Pacquaio, his closest rival for that mythical pound-for-pound honour, before one of them retires. Which brings us to one of the dreams which we mere mortal observers of the fight game and its heroes share. To see that fight happen.","Carl Froch has achieved great things and wants to finish in Sin City .

"Men who regularly take prescription painkillers have an increased risk of developing erectile dysfunction, according to a new study. Researchers found that regularly taking opioids, including codeine, increased a man’s risk of the condition. The study, published in the journal Spine, revealed that 19 per cent of men who took high-dose opioids for at least four months developed ED. Men who regularly take prescription painkillers for back pain have an increased risk of developing erectile dysfunction . In comparison, seven per cent of men who do not take opioids suffer from ED. Therefore, people taking opioids are more than 50 per cent more likely to develop ED than those who are not taking the medication. The most commonly used prescription opioids are hydrocodone, oxycodone, and morphine. The study of 11,000 men with back pain also showed that men over the age of 60 are much more likely to develop ED than younger men are. ‘Men who take opioid pain medications for an extended period of time have the highest risk of ED,’ said lead author Richard Deyo, investigator with the Kaiser Permanente Centre for Health Research and Professor of Evidence-based Family Medicine at Oregon Health & Science University. Men over the age of 60 are much more likely to develop ED than younger men . He added: ‘This doesn't mean that these medications cause ED, but the association is something patients and clinicians should be aware of when deciding if opioids should be used to treat back pain. ‘There is no question that for some patients opioid use is appropriate, but there is also increasing evidence that long-term use can lead to addiction, fatal overdoses, sleep apnea, falls in the elderly, reduced hormone production, and now erectile dysfunction.’ More than 12 per cent of the men studied who took low-dose opioids (under 120 mg) for at least four months had ED. Researchers found that age was the factor most significantly associated with receiving ED prescriptions. Men aged between 60 and 69 were 14 times more likely to receive prescriptions for ED medication than men aged 18 to 29. Depression and use of sedative hypnotics like benzodiazepines also increased the likelihood that a man would develop ED.","19% of men who take opioids for four months get ED .

"Brussels rules are letting thousands of migrants into Britain ‘by the back door’. Nearly 11,000 moved here this year on the basis of having been given citizenship in another EU country. The total, revealed in figures from the Office for National Statistics, is up more than a third on the 8,000 cases recorded in 2006. Many of the migrants would normally have been barred from taking up residence in Britain. Crowded island: Net immigration to Britain hit 252,000 last year . But under EU rules they are automatically entitled to  come here once they have EU citizenship and start working – or claiming benefits. The data, compiled from passenger surveys, shows that 47,000 non-EU immigrants have found their way to the UK using this method over the past five years. Priti Patel, the Tory MP who uncovered the information, said the loophole completely undermined Government efforts to curb the surge in immigration that took place under Labour. She urged ministers to raise the issue in Brussels and take action to wrest back control of Britain’s borders. Call for action: Tory MP Priti Patel . Miss Patel took up the issue herself after a BBC documentary in October highlighted the case of an Ecuadorean family who moved to London after gaining citizenship in Spain. The family of six were receiving £2,300 a month in housing benefit to rent a flat in Islington, as well as tax credits and child benefit. Miss Patel said she was ‘astonished’ by the number of people entering the UK by this route. She added: ‘The Government has made a commitment to cut immigration from outside the EU into  Britain. But those efforts are being completely undermined by this astonishing loophole which has already allowed 10,000 non-Europeans to sneak in through the backdoor each year. ‘The British public are living with the consequences of a decade of Labour’s open door policy on immigration which is why this Government must take on these EU laws that let non-Europeans come into Britain and access jobs and benefits. ‘It is in the British interest to reject these laws and on this issue, just say no to Europe. ‘This also raises the question of why these people are choosing to come here. They have entered the EU elsewhere and chosen to become citizens of other EU countries, yet they are still coming here. ‘Is it down to a benefits system which encourages people to come here and live off the state?’ The revelation raises fresh questions about the Coalition’s pledge to cut net immigration to under 100,000 a year. Last month official figures revealed that the figure had soared to a record 252,000 in 2010. Popular destination: Officials argue that there is little they can do to stem immigration from the EU . EU countries all have different requirements for migrants wanting to become a citizen, and there are fears that some could be a soft touch for those whose ultimate aim is to come to the UK. EU rules mean that asylum seekers are meant to be dealt with in the country of their arrival. But in cases where a migrant or asylum seeker has been granted citizenship they are free to travel anywhere in the EU. Critics claim that Britain’s generous benefits system acts as a magnet for migrants. Ministers have introduced a range of measures designed to curb immigration, including a cap on the number of non-EU economic migrants coming here and a crackdown on bogus colleges providing a route into Britain for migrants posing as students. But officials admit there is little they can do to curb immigration from the EU, because free movement of labour is a fundamental principle of the single market. A landmark ruling by the European Court of Justice last week stripped Britain of its power to return asylum seekers to Greece. Under EU rules, British officials can return asylum seekers to the first European country they set foot in. But the ECJ last week said no one should be returned to a country if it did not uphold their ‘fundamental rights’. This would rule out Greece because its asylum system is in such a mess. Around 90 per cent of illegal migrants enter Europe through the country.",Many would normally be barred - but are allowed in after obtaining citizenship from another EU country .
"From one of the world’s greatest fighters who is on a missionary visit to the Far East to a very local lad bearing a grudge in Liverpool, this is the first hectic weekend of boxing’s new winter season. Manny Pacquiao will try to put a potential billion dollar fight with Floyd Mayweather out of his mind so as to concentrate on beating American challenger Chris Algieri in Macau. Defeat for the PacMan in a catch-weight defence of his world welterweight title against a little-known light-welter champion would be a disaster commercially as well as for his legacy.

With talks reportedly on-going with Mayweather for the mega event the world has been waiting so long to see, this is a fight Pacquiao cannot afford to lose. Not with his promoter Bob Arum striving to open up the huge Chinese boxing market to its first pay-per-view fight. Not that he is likely to be beaten. Arum will be anxious that China’s own boxing idol, three-time world amateur champion and double Olympic gold medallist Zou Shiming, wins as well. Shiming’s success is the key to persuading the Beijing government to permit subscription television for his fights. China's Zou Shiming, a three-time world amateur champion and double gold medallist, will also be fighting . Expect him to prevail, also. Amusingly, against a Thai flyweight who looks so much like Pacquiao that they call him Mini-Manny. Another, even greater, ex-amateur finds himself on this bill in the remarkable position of defending a world title in only his third professional fight. Ukraine’s Vasyl Lomachenko takes on a Thai who, with 52 wins from his 53 fights, comes from the opposite end of the boxing spectrum. Earlier this Saturday night, on Merseyside, Tony Bellew angrily seeks home-town revenge for his previous defeat by former light-heavyweight world champion Nathan Cleverly. The hostile build-up, brilliantly stage-managed by promoter Eddie Hearn, has elevated a fight between two men who were each knocked out in recent world title fights into a pay-per-view Battle of Britain on Sky Sports television. Some selling job, this. Nathan Cleverly and Tony Bellew during the weigh in on Friday in Liverpool . The opposition duo come face to face as they build up to their clash on Saturday night . However, this is a competitive match-up in its own right. It is also a good mix of styles between Bellew the slugger from the streets and Cleverly the stylist with a university degree in mathematics. Bellew’s hunger for redemption should make him more dangerous this time around and Cleverly will need to have recovered his appetite for boxing if he is to repeat his victory and be the one moving on towards a world cruiser-weight title bid. George Groves may be given a sharp work-out by Denis Douglin in his latest come-back fight from that devastating Wembley Stadium KO by Carl Froch. The rest of the starry cast-list on Hearn’s packed promotion – including Scott Quigg and Jamie McDonnell in WBA title defences - should improve their records with victories ranging from comfortable to one-sided.","Manny Pacquiao set to face American challenger Chris Algieri in Macau .

"A school that was made famous in the film Gregory's Girl is being flattened by demolition crews, despite a desperate campaign to keep it open. Bulldozers today began tearing down Abronhill High in Cumbernauld, Lanarkshire, where  the 1981 Bill Forsyth film was shot. The work - expected to last one week - comes after parents and campaigners threatened to take legal action in a bid to keep the school open. Bulldozers have started tearing down Abronhill High in Cumbernauld, Lanarkshire, where they filmed the 1981 comedy Gregory's Girl . The work - expected to last a week - comes after parents and campaigners threatened to take court action in a bid to keep the school open . A group, who claimed the authority had not fulfilled its obligation under school closure legislation, raised around £5,500 to start a case against North Lanarkshire Council. But, after taking legal advice about their chances of successfully challenging the decision, the Save Abronhill High group announced in December that its campaign was at an end. Six months earlier, Scottish Ministers had rubber-stamped the local authority's decision to close the school, amid plans for a merger with another school in the area. Many of the scenes for Gregory's Girl were filmed at Abronhill High, a school which opened in 1978. The comedy starred John Gordon Sinclair as Gregory, Dee Hepburn as Dorothy and Clare Grogan as Susan. Kat Drummond, 48, a psychiatric nurse whose brother Paul, 51, was an extra in the film said: 'I'm very sad to see it go, I've been in tears about it. The Save Abronhill High group announced in December that its campaign would end, six months after the plans were rubber-stamped by Scottish Ministers . 'It's just not right, a bit of history is going and it was the heart of this community and will have a knock on effect, especially on the shops who relied on the kids spending money there. 'I was in the campaign to keep the school and was very vocal. We did everything we could and fought a long hard fight but unfortunately it wasn't meant to be.' She added: 'The campaign pulled the whole of Abronhill together and we fought a long hard campaign and didn't take it lying down. 'My brother was an extra in the film, he was in the cooling scene up the back washing dishes. Gregory's Girl is a 1981 Scottish coming-of-age romantic comedy film written and directed by Bill Forsyth . Many of the scenes  were filmed at the school, including in the corridors and classrooms . 'I watched it being filmed and it was a great laugh, I'm just so sad to see it go.' Last year, North Lanarkshire's learning and leisure services committee approved the merger of Abronhill and Cumbernauld High Schools. The council said the decision addressed the decreasing school roll and would create £1.3 million for the schools. Under the plan, there is due to be a new purpose-built school to replace both campuses. However, parents immediately appealed the decision to the Scottish Government, which called it in for review. The comedy starred John Gordon Sinclair as Gregory and Dee Hepburn as Dorothy (pictured) The campaign group was given a glimmer of hope when the government informed the authority that it had concerns over the educational benefit of the proposed closure, suggesting the merger move may 'lack clarity'. But, ministers approved the council's decision in June, with a number of conditions covering aspects such as funding, the timetable for change and pupil safety issues. Demolition crews have already removed the front of the building, allowing passers-by to see the inside of the classrooms. Meanwhile, a large digger is clearing up piles of rubble which were on the ground.","Bulldozers are flattening Abronhill High in Cumbernauld, Lanarkshire .

An American shark expert is on the hunt for a 11 metre great white shark off New Zealand's South Island . The shark fanatic and his team of thrill-seeking investigators teamed up with the Discovery Channel to uncover the truth behind the legendary 11 metre shark, which prowls off New Zealand's coast. While Stewart Island is a hive of activity for sharks, Jeff was on the hunt for the mega-specimen and took to diving in the dark to view the creatures at their most active time. Speaking to The New Zealand Herald, Jeff said it was one of the most full-on shark diving experiences he's ever had and believes New Zealand is one of the most populated areas for great white sharks in the world. Jeff Kurr and his team of professional shark specialists recorded their dangerous search for the gigantic shark for a new documentary . 'These things are just coming out of the darkness and they're super-big ... there were quite a number of sharks there and they were all go,' he said. However, experts believe the fabled 11 metre shark is just a legend as no formal sightings of the monster have been recorded. The renewed interest in New Zealand's shark community is at an all-time high due to the death of Adam Strange in a great white attack in Muriwai last February.

However he backs away shortly after and the door is swiftly shut closed with Jeff and the divers proclaiming that it's too risky. Jeff said he spoke to the fishermen in the local area, with many of them recounting experiences they have had with the mammoth great white sharks .

"Britain's broken society is slowly on the mend, with a quarter of a million more children living with both parents than when the Government came to power, Iain Duncan Smith said today. The Work and Pensions Secretary, who oversees all Government policy on social justice, said there were other ‘signs of hope’, including 160,000 people having taken up an offer of support to keep troubled families together. In a major speech in London, Mr Duncan Smith said he believed a ‘revolution is underway’ in some of Britain’s ‘poorest neighbourhoods’. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said 250,000 more children were living with both parents than in 2010 . There are record numbers of people in work, up two million since 2010, 33,000 pupils on free school meals are now getting good grades in English and Maths GCSE and members of 53,000 troubled families are back to school or into work, he said. Official figures also suggest 2,100 former gang members are ‘back on the straight and narrow’. The latest figures show economic inactivity is at a historic low, and more than 800,000 fewer people are on the main out-of-work benefits. There has also been the largest ever annual fall both in youth unemployment and workless households. ‘Each and every one of these statistics is a rise in hope. Each and every one, a life transformed,’ Mr Duncan Smith said. He claimed that the Government had been ‘unwavering in its commitment to social reform’, saying changes to welfare, education, justice and health were all designed ‘so that they no longer trap people, but set them on a path from dependency to independence’. ‘Social justice is about offering meaningful routes out of disadvantage, and dispelling the appalling idea that it is easier to manage the problem than to help transform people’s lives. ‘For you don’t solve addiction by parking people on methadone. You don’t stop problem debt by abandoning people to payday lenders. ‘You don’t rehabilitate offenders by simply locking them away, and you don't cure welfare dependency by parking people on benefits.’ The decline of the traditional family, pictured in the 1950s, had damaged the prospects of the poor, Iain Duncan Smith has said . Previous governments had thrown ‘more and more taxpayers’ money on ineffective remedial policies, in the hope of doing something’ about the country’s social ills, he said. The coalition had pioneered a new approached, investing in programmes based on results and which involved ‘intervening early’ and ‘offering second chances out where lives do go off track’. ‘It has not been easy, for cultural change is never quick. Yet I believe we are now seeing real progress,’ Mr Duncan Smith said. ‘It starts with prevention: getting to the source of social problems early, rather than waiting to pick up the pieces.’ He pointed to schemes in health, where new family nurse partnerships are now helping vulnerable mothers in over 100 councils, and the record number of parents – more than a million – now using children’s centres. Some 260,000 disadvantaged two-year-olds are now benefiting from free early education, he added. Despite the progress, he warned that the ‘disparity between the top and bottom of society is in many cases larger than it has ever been’. ‘We have a group of skilled professionals and wealth creators at the top of society who have little or no connection to those at the bottom. ‘Yet in so many cases what divides the two is little more than a different start in life. ‘I believe social investment gives us an opportunity to lock not just wealth back into our most disadvantaged areas – but something else as well.’ Mr Duncan Smith urged the wealthy and big firms to put money into ‘social enterprises’ in deprived neighbourhoods.","Minister said 'revolution is underway' in UK's 'poorest neighbourhoods'

"A 60-year-old man was arrested on Tuesday in connection with the discovery last spring of 25 dead cats hanging from trees in plastic bags, a grisly find that prompted animal lovers to post $25,000 in reward money. Rene Carcamo of Yonkers was charged with illegally disposing of the dead cats, according to Westchester County's Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. He was not charged with killing the cats. The charge is a violation of environmental law. Ernest Lungaro, director of enforcement for the SPCA, said: 'That's what we're able to prove, that he was hanging them.' WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Rene Carcamo, a Yonkers resident, was charged with illegally disposing of the dead cats in April but not killing them . The bodies of around 30 cats were discovered in bags hanging from trees in Yonkers, New York, in April . He would not say if officials believe Carcamo also killed the cats. The SPCA said in April that tests on three cats' bodies showed the animals were killed with blows to the head at various times over the previous year and were already dead when they were put in the bags. The cats were discovered in April by a public works crew doing an annual cleanup in a wooded area just off Overlook Terrace in Yonkers, about a mile and a half north of the Bronx. Carcamo lives nearby. Animal welfare groups and private citizens, including Geezer Butler of the heavy metal band Black Sabbath, posted $25,000 in reward money. The SPCA did not immediately return messages asking what would become of the money. In addition to the charge related to the dead cats, Carcamo was charged with animal cruelty. The SPCA said that during the investigation, Lungaro found two sick kittens in Carcamo's possession and told him to take them to a veterinarian, but he did not. Lungaro later took the kittens away and a vet found them to be severely neglected, the SPCA said. Lungaro said Carcamo's arrest was still being processed. He had no information on an arraignment or a defense lawyer. Calls to Yonkers police were not immediately returned. The cats appear to have been put in the bags at different times, Lieutenant Patrick McCormack told the Yonkers Daily Voice in April. Each bag appeared to have contained one cat each, authorities said. But wildlife had apparently torn open some of the bags, causing the animals to fall out. Animal welfare groups and private citizens, including Geezer Butler of the heavy metal band Black Sabbath, posted $25,000 in reward money to find the culprit who suspended the cat corpses from the trees .","Rene Carcamo, 60, of Yonkers, New York was charged with illegally disposing of the dead cats .

"The world's largest collection of movie posters boasting artwork from almost every single film ever made has emerged for sale for $7.8 million (£5 million). The colossal archive features 196,000 posters from more than 44,000 films which have been made since the birth of cinema in the early 1900s and has been single-handedly pieced together by one avid collector over the last 50 years. Morris Everett Jr, from Cleveland, Ohio, has dedicated his life's work to seeking out original posters from every English-speaking film ever made and compiling them into a comprehensive library. The Prince and the Showgirl starring Marilyn Monroe, film from 1957, is part the collection . Breakfast at Tiffany's, starring Audrey Hepburn in 1961 is part of the 196,000 strong poster collection . Highlights of the collection include one-of-a-kind poster from 1927 silent film Metropolis said to be worth $47,000 (£30,000) alone, plus original artwork from film classics like Breakfast at Tiffany's, Gone with the Wind and The Wizard of Oz. But it also includes posters from more modern epics like The Godfather, The Terminator, Pulp Fiction and Titanic as well as films right up to the present day. Mr Everett Jr, 73, is a historian-turned-collector whose passion for posters began in 1961 while he was still at university. Instead of following in his father's footsteps by collecting stamps he discovered movie posters and set about building a collection. The first two posters he bought were for 1961 romantic drama Splendor in the Grass, starring Warren Beatty, and the 1938 flick The Charge of the Light Brigade with Errol Flynn. Casablanca, starring Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in 1942 was collected by the historian . Morris Everett Jr, from Ohio, stands with some of his movie posters - the world's largest collection . He has since acquired posters and entire collections from all over the world and is the only person attempting to acquire posters from every film made. In 1991 Mr Everett Jr set up the Everett Collection, turning his hobby into a business by licencing images of his posters. He has grown it into the world's largest collection which is stored in bank vaults. Now in his seventies, Mr Everett Jr has decided to sell up so that he can see his life's work enjoyed by others. The collection is tipped to make $8 million - around £5 million pounds - when it goes under the hammer in one lot at Los Angeles saleroom Profiles in History. Metropolis, a silent movie from 1927 is the first movie poster that started Everett's collection . Gone With the Wind, from 1939, is one of the original movie posters in the collection . That equates to just $39 (£25) for each poster, but incredibly, experts say if the collection was sold individually it could be worth up to $23 million (£15 million). Mr Everett Jr said: 'I started collecting 53 years ago when I asked a friend of mine who had a small collection of posters where he got them and he told me about a store in New York called Movie Star News. 'When I went on vacation I went to that store and bought posters from Splendor in the Grass and Charge of the Light Brigade. 'I come from a collecting family and that was where my collection started. 'I bought a collection of 6,000 pieces in the late 1960s and from then on I started buying up other people's collections. 'It became my goal to collect a poster from every single English-speaking film ever made. The Mummy, from 1932, is part of the collection that is set to sell for a whopping $8 million . The Wizard of Oz movie poster, filmed in 1939, will go under the hammer in one lot at a California saleroom   on December 17 . 'There were only two people in the world at the time collecting posters from every single title. They are both now dead and I acquired both their collections. 'I wanted my collection to be comprehensive, capturing the history of countries through film. 'I bought small collections and large collections, and I even got into financial troubles doing so, but I always considered it a hobby rather than an investment. 'That was until the late 1980s when I went through a divorce and I had to look at my financial situation. 'I realised that instead of investing in the stock market I invested in movie memorabilia. 'I opened a store in Hollywood and a store in Cleveland buying, selling and trading movie posters. 'There's no other collection in the world that even comes close to mine in terms of its comprehensiveness covering movie posters from 1907 right up to the present day. Girl From 10th Avenue movie poster, filmed in 1935, is part of the comprehensive library . 'There are many one-of-a-kind pieces in there. This collection couldn't be replicated today. 'I'm selling the collection now because I want to see the collection go to a good home while I am living and save my family the trouble of dealing with 196,000 posters when I'm gone. 'The collection is unique and it is being sold as a single entity rather than individual lots because I would love it to remain as a whole. 'The crazy thing about it is that even though I've listed my posters for sale I'm still collecting and adding to it. I want to make it the very best I can. 'It's been so much fun putting this collection together and I feel very privileged to have been able to do it. A collection of the 196,000 posters Morris Everett Jr has collected can be seen in this picture . 'It will be a strange feeling not owning it any more but at the same time there will be a small sense of relief at making life a little more simple.' Auctioneers have described the sale as 'a once in a lifetime opportunity'. Joe Maddalena, owner of Profiles in History, said: 'The Morris Everett Jr. Collection is the most substantial and significant vintage movie collection in the world and will feature several-one-of-kind treasures never before offered to the collecting public. 'The items exemplify classic Hollywood, reflecting the true lure of Hollywood's Golden Age.' The auction will be held on December 17.

"One player at Leyton Orient is understood to be earning more than £20,000 a week. Take a deep breath. Yes, twenty grand. That’s a million a year plus change. In League One. And what does that buy the club nearest and dearest to my heart? Leyton Orient are second bottom of League One and in real danger of relegation to the fourth tier . Fabio Liverani's Orient side were beaten 4-1 by Scunthorpe last weekend at the Matchroom Stadium . Right now we are languishing next to bottom of the third tier of English football, with relegation to the bottom rung of the Football League looking more likely with every passing week. Even though they sack managers almost as often as the team change their socks it would be harsh to blame Orient’s new Italian owners. They have ploughed tens of millions into the club since taking over from Barry Hearn last summer. So what have Francesco Becchetti and his amici learned from this deflating experience thus far? Exactly what the occupants of that glittering ivory tower way above them, the Premier League, keep discovering. That the more you pay the lesser the likelihood that your players will stay super-fit, obsessively focused and prepared to die with their boots on for very long at all. Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo passed the age of 30 but remains in prime physical condition . It is a rare breed of young sportsmen who get filthy rich overnight yet are still hungry for success, year in year out. Rather, once they have shot to fame and fortune they disappear up their own ego, then reappear in night clubs. For every Cristiano Ronaldo there are dozens of Jack Wilsheres. As he turns 30, Ronaldo is in such prime physical condition that he looks as if he could carry on winning the World Footballer of the Year award for another five seasons. His insatiable desire to pile up more honours with Real Madrid and to keep proving himself the best player on the planet – better even than Lionel Messi - supplies that urge to train like a demon, live right, eat healthy and eschew the vices. The Portuguese superstar is often one of the first to show up at the training ground . Ronaldo will not rest until he has given every last fibre to try and surpass Pele as the greatest of all time . By his own manic admission, Ronaldo will not rest until he has given every last fibre of his being trying to surpass Pele as the greatest footballer of all time. The advances in sports science – medical, dietary and a programmed lifestyle which allows for not only Spartan exercise but repetitive skills practice – is raising the age barrier for the dedicated few. The birthday which Ronaldo celebrated on Thursday by sipping a nutritional drink used to be the watershed age for footballers. Now several of the world’s best are performing at the elite level well into their 30s. Messi is no slouch but one vital dimension in which Ronaldo surpassed him to win the Ballon d’Or last month is the physical. That takes single-minded commitment. Sir Alex Ferguson greets Ronaldo at Carrington in 2003 after signing him from Sporting Lisbon . Most of Ronaldo’s down time is devoted to rest and recovery, for which his home is filled with state-of-the-art equipment. When the majority of his Madrid team-mates arrive for training they usually find him stretching and exercising in the gymnasium, not only to build strength but to ensure that his body is ready for the coming session on the pitch. Real coach Paul Clement reports: ‘Cristiano is really pushing the boundaries.’ Since much of this hard work is also designed to reduce the risk of injury it is not inconceivable that Ronaldo could still be near his peak 10 years from now, as he approaches his 40th birthday. Former Manchester United manager with Ronaldo after winning the Champions League in Moscow . Ronaldo won three Premier League titles with Manchester United before leaving for Real Madrid . No wonder Sir Alex Ferguson was so reluctant to let him leave Old Trafford. Ask the greatest of all British managers what attributes mattered most to him when signing a player, he usually replies along these lines: ‘If Manchester United are considering someone you can assume he has real talent. So what I’m looking for then is character. A lad desperate to win, who will want to keep on and on and on winning.’ Younger players of that ilk coming up behind Ronaldo and who will benefit from ever-improving methods if they so choose - Brazilian genius Neymar who is naturally so lean and lithe notable among them – might actually remain fully in their prime to 40. Meanwhile Master Wilshere has been photographed yet again in a nightclub, for the third time in a pose which suggests he has been smoking. Ronaldo won his third Ballon d'Or crown this year, and is now one behind his rival Lionel Messi . Ronaldo and Messi battle for the ball during an El Clasico match at the Nou Camp in 2010 . Young Jack is fortunate that the rebuke from his Arsenal manager will be moderated by Arsene Wenger’s admission that he used to smoke and his expression of opinion that the habit ‘does not necessarily impact on a player’s performance.’ In that, history is on Wenger’s side. Ossie Ardiles was both a cigarette smoker and one of the world’s outstanding players for a decade, orchestrating from midfield Argentina’s 1978 World Cup triumph under chain-smoking manager Cesar Luis Menotti and lighting up before lifting the FA Cup with Tottenham at Wembley. But it is not so much the quick drag which is worrying for we who recognise that Wilshere has the ability to grow into an important player for England. It is the louche lifestyle. Jack Wilshere (right) appeared to be holding a shisha pipe during a night out in London . Wilshere is closing in on a return to full fitness after undergoing ankle surgery . Former Tottenham midfielder Ossie Ardiles in action for Argentina at the 1978 World Cup . Mostly, for top sportsmen, the days are for training, the evenings for rest, the nights for sleeping not clubbing. At 23, Wilshere is young enough to learn from his mistakes and turn his life around. As he keeps promising to do. But if he leaves it much longer it will be too late for him to fulfil all that talent. Like plenty before him. You have to fear for him. Because it is also about the money. The incentive to prioritise sporting dedication over life’s temptations comes more naturally to those of more modest means. And if you think the £100,000-plus weekly wages of the most celebrated players in this country are ludicrously excessive, you ain’t seen nothing yet. Sky Sports face a four-way battle to keep hold of the lion's share of Premier League rights . A Premier League already awash with cash is about see its next package deal for three years of TV rights soar above the current £3billion. Perhaps by double. To more than £8m for a single match. That will be the result of a bidding war as two more networks – one the American parent company of Eurosport, the other in oil-rich Qatar – go against Sky and BT for live games. Be sure that a large chunk of the extra fortune will be grasped by the star players. Some will filter down to the Football League. Until that happens we wait to see if twenty grand a week will be enough for Orient to clamber clear of the drop. We can but hope...","Leyton Orient are second bottom of League One and in relegation danger .

"It is one of the world's most renowned dinosaur fossil sites. But on this occasion, visitors to Canada's Dinosaur Provincial Park were gripped by an entirely different phenomenon. Instead, US-based photographer Andy Best and his friend Chad Kendrick unexpectedly found themselves enjoying unrivalled views of the spectacular Northern Lights dancing across the night sky. US-based photographer and cinematographer Andy Best and his friend Chad Kendrick travelled to Dinosaur Provincial Park in Alberta, Canada, where they shot the Northern Lights . Mr Best, from Shelley in Idaho, USA, had been on an assignment to photograph the park for travel company Travel Alberta earlier this month. The pair had spent two weeks photographing Canada's scenery. But the men were shocked when the famously unpredictable Northern Lights made a sudden and unexpected appearance. The pair quickly raced to photograph the scene playing out above them, which is often regarded as one of the world's most striking natural phenomena. Mr Best said: ‘It was a moment I'll never forget - I sat in the dark, staring out at the final glow of the sunset. ‘Having just finished backing up footage from the day, I looked up at a massive glow in the sky. ‘I ran over to Chad and screamed “The Northern Lights” - we tossed everything in our jeeps and ran full speed into the Badlands, not really knowing when it might end. ‘Luckily, it went all night and I got to experience my first Northern Lights.’ The scientific term for the Lights is the aurora borealis. They can only be seen between September and March each year . Displays of the Northern Lights are notoriously unpredictable and cannot be forecast in advance . In addition to the absence of the Northern Lights appearing, visibility can often be reduced by cloud cover and light pollution from nearby towns . Photographer Andy Best and his friend Chad Kendrick were shocked to see the Northern Light appear in the night sky during their trip to Dinosaur Provincial Park in Alberta, Canada . Displays of the Northern Lights occur when solar particles enter the Earth’s atmosphere and on impact emit burning gases that produce green, yellow and blue-coloured lights . Displays of the Northern Lights, whose scientific name is aurora borealis, occur when solar particles enter the Earth’s atmosphere. On impact they emit burning gases that produce green, yellow and blue-coloured lights. However, they are notoriously unpredictable and cannot be forecast in advance. The traditional places for optimum Northern Lights viewings are the northern reaches of Scandinavia, Finland, Iceland, Canada and Alaska. The Lights themselves can only be seen between September and March each year. In addition to the absence of the Northern Lights appearing, visibility can often be reduced by cloud cover and light pollution from nearby towns. The Dinosaur Provincial Park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site which is noted for its striking badland landscape - a type of dry terrain characterised by steep slopes and minimal vegetation . Mr Best now lives in Portland, Oregon and specialises in sport and outdoor photography. The Dinosaur Provincial Park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site which is noted for its striking badland landscape - a type of dry terrain characterised by steep slopes and minimal vegetation. The canyons, ravines and gullies makes the landscape difficult to navigate. The park is well known for being one of the richest dinosaur fossil sites in the world. Forty dinosaur species have been discovered at the park and more than 500 specimens have been removed and exhibited in museums around the globe. He added: ‘I'm a third generation photographer that's been making movies since before I can remember. The Dinosaur Provincial Park is well-known for being one of the richest dinosaur fossil sites in the world . ‘I grew up playing sports and spending as much time as possible in the outdoors. 'After years creating relationships and grinding, I’ve been able to connect with various brands in the industry that support my endeavors. ‘I believe in life, love and the pursuit of adventure. It’s important to stay centered, but dream big. ‘I find passion in the people and world around me. 'It’s in my core to work hard and love others. Simple fact: life gives you what you put into it. ‘I’ve had the great opportunity to work with several brands this year. I put 30,000 miles on my Jeep working on travel campaigns. ‘From Goal Zero, Gerber Outdoors, Toyota, to Travel Alberta, and various other travel brands, it’s been a very productive year. 'I’m excited for the future. 2015 is filled with several missions that I can’t wait for.

"The only certainty, at least so far as 10 minutes ago, is that if Amir Khan fights Manny Pacquiao this summer it will not take place at Wembley Stadium. The HBO pay-TV network in America has determined May 30 as the putative date for that potential blockbuster and the new Wembley is already booked that Saturday for one of the oldest fixtures in our sporting calendar: A little local matter called the FA Cup Final. Whether Bolton Man and the PacMan actually box each other that day, somewhere, depends on whether the Money Man chooses to fight either or neither of them in Las Vegas four weeks earlier. Amir Khan and Manny Pacquiao met at a south London boxing club last week to discuss a possible fight . Pacquiao visited London but if he does fight Khan, the fight will not be held at Wembley Stadium . If Floyd Mayweather picks one, the other will be left to fight that hardy old regular around the rings, A. N. Other. If he opts for Miguel Cotto, then Pacquiao and Khan will be looking for a place to conduct their violent but lucrative business. Cardiff’s Millennium Stadium is a possibility but Las Vegas or New York is more likely, or even Abu Dhabi where extra bucket loads of cash in the form of a massive site fee beckons Khan, the hero of moderate Islam. Meanwhile ,the wait goes on and the speculation becomes ever more feverish. Cup a hand to one ear and you hear a respected insider, American TV commentator Jim Lampley, pronouncing definitively: ‘Mayweather is fighting Cotto in Las Vegas on May 2.’ Strain the other ear and you can discern Pacquiao saying: ‘I now expect to be fighting Mayweather next.’ Cock both ears to the fans surrounding Mayweather at a basketball game the other night and you are deafened by chants like these: ‘Fight Manny Pacquiao… We Want Pacquiao.’ Floyd Mayweather is yet to decide who he will fight when he returns to the ring in Las Vegas on May 2 . Mayweather could opt to have a rematch with Miguel Cotto, whom he beat three years ago . Is he listening? Only if this is a shot the pound-for-pound king really wants to call. Does he care? Perhaps only if his paymasters at the Showtime TV network tell him that these vocal expressions of public opinion indicate the risk of a fall in his pay-per-view ratings if he recycles Cotto, who he outpointed by a desert mile a couple of years ago. When Pacquiao made his most confident forecast yet that Mayweather would finally agree to the richest fight in boxing history, he did so when within ear-shot of Khan. That was during their visit to the historic Fitzroy Lodge Boxing Club in south east London, a grass-roots engagement which Pacquiao fitted in between dinner with Prince Harry at Buckingham Palace and judging the Miss Universe contest in Miami. Later, for a Sky Sports filming of his visit to London to be screened at 10.15 pm this Wednesday, Pacquiao said: ‘Mayweather claims he’s the No 1 pound for pound, so I want to feel the punches of the No 1 pound for pound,’ With regard to Mayweather’s demands for Olympic standard blood testing, Pacquiao added: ‘He knows blood testing is no the issue. He’s just making up alibis to avoid the fight.’ Pacquiao met Prince Harry on his trip to London, pictured on the right with wife Jinkee . Pacquiao waves from the stage  during the 63rd Annual Miss Universe pageant on Sunday night . Neither that narrative nor Cotto’s possibly tell-tale withdrawal from a bout with Canelo Alvarez were music to Khan’s ears, since he harbours his own ambition of boxing Mayweather. But at least he and his old sparing mate Pacquiao have their Plan B pretty much in place. Pacquiao’s promoter Bob Arum – who has to keep rebutting claims from Mayweather’s Money Team that it is he not Floyd who is blocking the biggest one of all – has sounded out the Mandalay Bay arena in Las Vegas and New York’s Barclays Center as the alternatives to Khan’s apparently unworkable Wembley proposition. It is unlikely that any other venue in Britain could overcome HBO’s reluctance to compromise their optimum Saturday fight-night broadcast schedule, given the trans-Atlantic time difference. There has been talk of Abu Dhabi bank-rolling a Mayweather-Pacquiao fight to the tune of $300 million but, in the absence of an enthusiastic response, that offer was withdrawn. Arum is among those who would take much convincing of the feasibility of such a project, not least since he is committed to opening up the vast Chinese boxing market through promotions in Macao like the one in which Pacquiao recently thrashed Chris Algieri. Kell Brook (right) is desperate to face Khan after winning the IBF welterweight title against Shawn Porter . Brook makes the first defence of his title against mandatory challenger Jo Jo Dan on March 28 . And whither Khan if Mayweather and Pacquiao are occupied with each othe in the Nevada rather than Arabian desert this May? Wembley would be back in the picture for a proposed Battle of Britain in June if Kell Brook’s promoter Eddie Hearn could tempt Khan to challenge for Special K’s recently won world welterweight belt. Brook returns from the horrific stab wound suffered in a holiday incident for a routine voluntary defence in Sheffield on March 28 but Khan is already working on his Plan C with Tim Bradley and two men against whom he suffered defeats, Lamont Peterson and Danny Garcia, among possible opponents. But all depends on whom Mayweather invites to his May ball. The word is that he will name the anointed one by the start of next week, but like so much else in this soap opera that is pure speculation. We will keep our ear to the ground. Kell Brook’s options for a big fight of his own are widening with the arrival in London of Juan Manuel Marquez. The Mexican legend, who confirmed his Hall of Fame candidacy with that brutal knock-out of Manny Pacquiao, is expected to have mano-a-mano talks with Brook about a summer showdown in England. Marquez is in town as assistant trainer and star supporter of Daniel Estrada, his countryman who meets Kevin Mitchell in a world lightweight title final eliminator at London’s O2 Arena on Saturday night. Juan Manuel Marquez's (right) last fight was a unanimous points win over Mike Alvarado last year . Marquez knocked Pacquiao out cold when they met for a third time in Las Vegas in December 2012 . However, Marquez is said to be contemplating a challenge to Brook for his world welterweight title if Sheffield’s Special K successfully defends that IBF belt against Jo Jo Dan on his March 28 home-town comeback from stab wounds. Nacho Beristain, renowned lead trainer of Marquez and Estrada, told Boxing Scene: ‘There is a meeting. Marquez is coming to the end of a fine career but still cherishes the ambition of becoming Mexico’s first five-weight world champion.’ Beristain says: If Juan can do that it would be fantastic, an ideal way for him to retire. And we’d like a fight with Brook.’ First, Marquez will be firmly in Estrada’s corner for a fight which will also decide which is the strongest power behind a prize-fighter – iconic professional backing or a good woman. Kevin Mitchell (right) fights for the first time since May when he faces Daniel Estrada at the O2 on Saturday . Estrada unsuccessfully challenged for the WBC lightweight world title against Omar Figueroa last year . Estrada says: ‘Mitchell is a good fighter but I will be all the stronger for having Juan Manuel behind me, helping me, inspiring me.’ Romford’s Mitchell admits that boozy nights undermined his two world title challenges thus far – against Michael Katsidis and Ricky Burns – but now says: ‘My new girlfriend Jodie has helped me turn away from the drink, improve my diet and focus on my training. I’m all about the boxing now.’ The winner of this one becomes the mandatory challenger to WBC world champion Omar Figueroa. Mitchell vs Estrada will be televised live on Sky Sports 1 from 8pm on Saturday night. Anthony Joshua, Britain’s super-heavyweight gold medallist at the London Olympics, had his meteoric rise through the professional ranks interrupted by withdrawal with injury from a co-bill-topping fight at this Saturday’s O2 arena against solid American Kevin Johnson. That fight is being rescheduled as one of two appearances planned for Joshua by promoter Eddie Hearn in the month of April. Joshua, who was among the throng of aspiring younger boxers who welcomed Manny Pacquiao and Amir Khan to the century old Fitzroy Lodge club on Friday, told me there: ‘It was a stress fracture of the back but it’s getting better. At this stage of my career I want to fight often, like boxers in the old days.’","Amir Khan and Manny Pacquiao met at a London boxing club last week .
