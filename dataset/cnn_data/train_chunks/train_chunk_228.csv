"Atlanta (CNN) -- Reese Witherspoon's legal trouble over a spat with a Georgia state trooper has been settled with a fine, though a newly released video of the arrest -- with lines such as ""you better not arrest me; are you kidding me?"" -- is giving it fresh attention. The Oscar-winning actress, accused of interfering with the drunken driving arrest of her husband last month in Atlanta, pleaded no contest Thursday to a charge of physical obstruction of another and has paid a $213 fine, according to Municipal Court of Atlanta Administrator Christopher Patterson. Her husband, James Toth, pleaded guilty Thursday to a charge of driving under the influence and has been placed on 12 months of probation, Patterson said. Their pleas were entered in the Atlanta court by the couple's attorneys. Terms of Toth's probation weren't immediately available. Patterson said the pleas resolve both cases. The pleas came on the day that TMZ.com posted part of a video from a police dashboard camera showing Witherspoon arguing with the trooper who was arresting the couple. CNN later obtained the video from the Georgia Department of Public Safety. Witherspoon -- who was in Atlanta working on a movie called ""The Good Lie"" -- and Toth were arrested on April 19 when a Georgia state trooper stopped Toth after seeing him weave in and out of a lane as he drove, police said. The video shows the trooper, while testing Toth for DUI for more than 10 minutes, asking Witherspoon several times to stay in the car. Early in the process, she said: ""I'm pregnant and I need to use the (restroom)."" ""I need you to get back in the car, and there ain't no way to use it out here,"" the trooper responds. ""If I tell you again, I'm going to arrest you."" Later, the video shows that the trooper, while giving Toth a breath test, breaks away to address Witherspoon again: ""Ma'am, sit on your butt and be quiet."" It's unclear on the video what was said next, though the trooper wrote in a police report that Witherspoon at one point began to ""hang out the window and say that she did not believe that I was a real police officer."" Then, as the trooper begins to arrest Toth, the video shows, Witherspoon approaches them. ""Ma'am, what did I just tell you to do?"" the trooper asks in the video. ""I am a U.S. citizen. I am allowed to stand on American ground and ask any question I want to ask,"" Witherspoon says. The trooper then handcuffs her as Toth tries to calm her. ""You better not arrest me. Are you kidding me?"" Witherspoon says. ""I'm an American citizen. This is beyond. ... You're harassing me as an American citizen. I have done nothing against the law. ... I have to obey your orders? No sir, I do not."" Witherspoon continues, ""Do you know my name, sir? ... You're about to find out who I am."" A breath test on Toth registered 0.139, above the legal limit of 0.08 for a driving under the influence charge, the report said. After canceling TV appearances following her arrest, the 37-year-old actress told ABC's ""Good Morning America"" on Thursday that she was sorry and that she was ""so disrespectful"" to the officer. ""We went out to dinner in Atlanta, and we had one too many glasses of wine, and we thought we were fine to drive and we absolutely were not,"" she said. ""It's completely unacceptable, and we are so sorry and embarrassed. We know better, and we shouldn't have done that."" Witherspoon said that despite what she told the trooper, she's not pregnant. ""I said crazy things. ... I had no idea what I was talking about,"" she told ""Good Morning America's"" George Stephanopolous. ""When a police officer tells you to stay in the car, you stay in the car. I learned that for sure,"" she told Stephanopolous, laughing. ""I think I've played a lawyer in a movie so many times I think I am a lawyer, and clearly I'm not a lawyer, because I got arrested. So yeah, I learned a lot."" Witherspoon won the best actress Oscar for the 2005 movie ""Walk the Line.""

"Chicago (CNN) -- Doctors who treat breast cancer patients are very excited about an experimental drug that presents a whole new way of knocking out cancer cells. The drug, trastuzumab emtansine, commonly referred to as T-DM1, appears to be superior to the standard treatment for women with advanced HER2-positive breast cancer. Researchers are presenting the results of a large three-year clinical trial Sunday at the 2012 American Society of Clinical Oncology conference in Chicago. It's a combination of the targeted drug trastuzumab (the ""T"" in T-DM1), better known by the brand name Herceptin, and a very powerful chemotherapy drug called emtansine (the ""DM1"" part). The drug is designed to work when Herceptin alone no longer can keep the cancer in check. New drugs may help immune system fight cancer . ""It's a brand new way of treating HER2-positive breast cancer,"" said the lead study author, Dr. Kimberly Blackwell. ""This will offer a very important therapeutic option for patients faced with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer."" In this combination drug, Herceptin is delivering the chemo drug to the cancer cell. Blackwell likens it to being used like a carrier pigeon that delivers the DM1 drug, which is what kills the cancer cell. DM-1 is too toxic to deliver directly into the bloodstream like other chemotherapy drugs. So the Herceptin part of T-DM1 homes in on the cancer cells (sparing other healthy cells) and delivers the powerful DM1 chemo drug into the cell. About 20% to 25% of women with breast cancer have HER2-positive breast cancer, a particularly aggressive and deadly form of the disease that was very difficult to treat until the FDA approved Herceptin in 1998, revolutionizing how this type of cancer was treated. Herceptin is an engineered antibody that attaches to the surface of the cancer cell and blocks signals in the cell that tell the cancer to grow. It also boosts the patient's immune system to help fight the cancer. But in some patients, the cancer comes back, and Herceptin eventually stops working. That's when doctors prescribe a combination of the drugs capecitabine (brand name Xeloda) and lapatinib (brand name Tykerb), which has had its successes. In this clinical trial, nearly 1,000 patients were divided into two groups: One got the standard capecitabine plus lapatinib treatment; the other group got the experimental drug. Women getting T-DM1 had 9.6 months of progression-free survival, the time between starting the treatment and the cancer getting worse again, compared with 6.4 months in the standard therapy group. That's a median improvement of three months. This may not seem like a long time, but as Dr. Eric Winer of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston explains, it means a lot to the individual patient. ""I've had patients on this drug for one, two, three years,"" he explained. Winer says that if a patient gets an additional three months before the tumors start growing again each time she goes through a treatment cycle, that can add up to almost a year. Some doctors don't know long-term side effects of cancer care . Blackwell says that after two years, 65% of women getting T-DM1 were still alive, compared with 48% in the control group. And even though this drug is not a cure, many oncologists call these trial results a ""huge deal."" That's because another significant benefit with T-DM1 was the lack of significant side effects and better quality of life. Women on T-DM1 did not suffer the usual and often grueling chemotherapy side effects seen in the other group: diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, painful hand-foot syndrome and hair loss. Blackwell said the types of side effects they did have were the kind only a doctor would notice. ""It really changed their whole outlook on what it meant to be on cancer treatment,"" said Blackwell, who treats patients at Duke University. She added that seeing this benefit for her patients was incredibly rewarding as a breast cancer doctor. This is the first group of (breast cancer) patients where we have to worry about fixing their hair for media interviews. It's huge deal for these patients."" ""It's producing very promising results, and as someone who sees a ton of patients, what I'm really excited about is the side effect profile,"" said Dr. Jennifer Litton, who treats breast cancer patients at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston but who was not involved in the study. ""It's significantly better than most chemotherapy drugs that we're giving. ""This trial is showing pretty impressive results on the tip of the iceberg where immune therapy can take us,"" Litton said. Dr. Louis Weiner, director of Georgetown University's Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, agrees, calling T-DM1 a ""magic bullet."" ""It represents the fruition of a concept that was advocated more than 100 years ago by Paul Ehrlich, the famous immunologist and Nobel Prize winner, who dreamed of creating basically Trojan horses that would be welcomed into the cell but would be dragging something that is very bad for the cell. This is pretty much how T-DM1 works,"" he said. ""It's a good drug. I think it will be used quite a bit,"" Winer said. Right now, only women participating in the clinical trial have access to this new drug, until it gets approved in the United States and other countries. Genentech, the company that developed T-DM1, says an application for potential approval will be sent to the FDA and the European counterpart, the European Medicine Agence, this year. It's unclear how much this new drug will cost, but other new cancer drugs can be very expensive, costing upwards of tens of thousands of dollars, sometime even around $100,000. ""I hope it won't be priced at such a level that it that bankrupts our health care system,"" Winer said.","Researchers say drug combination is superior in fighting HER2-positive cancer .

"(CNN) -- A Chicago hotel has closed and drained its pool, hot tub and fountain in response to the deaths of two people who contracted the flu-like Legionnaires' disease, authorities said Monday. Since August 14, health officials have recorded eight confirmed cases of Legionnaires' disease, including the two deaths, among guests who visited the JW Marriott Chicago hotel in downtown Chicago. ""We believe that there is no ongoing health threat at the hotel. Individuals who stayed at the hotel during this time period who are experiencing flu-like symptoms are encouraged to get in touch with a healthcare provider because it is important that all potential cases are diagnosed and treated as soon as possible,"" said Kathleen Ritger, a doctor at the Chicago Department of Public Health. Legionnaires' disease is a respiratory bacterial infection usually spread through mist that comes from a water source, such as cooling towers, air conditioning or showers. It is not transmitted person to person. Symptoms of the disease include fever, chills and a cough. Most people recover, but between 5% to 30% of those who get the disease die, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. Each year an estimated 8,000 to 18,000 hospitalized cases occur in the United States. An outbreak of the disease in Philadelphia in 1976, largely among people attending a convention of the American Legion, led to its name. Along with draining a pool, fountain and hot tub, the hotel is working to alert guests who stayed there from July 16 through August 15, a Marriott spokeswoman said.

"Washington (CNN) -- While conservatives are still seething over last week's Supreme Court ruling saving President Barack Obama's health care overhaul, top Capitol Hill Republicans are gleefully using the decision to fire up their base with promises of a repeal in 2013. The high court's 5-4 decision ""underscores the urgency of repealing this harmful law in its entirety,"" House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said shortly after last Thursday's ruling. ""Republicans stand ready to work with a president who will listen to the American people."" House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, announced that his GOP-controlled chamber will vote on a full repeal on July 11. While the House is certain pass the measure -- it's already done so once before -- the largely symbolic bill has no chance of clearing the Democratic-run Senate. But what if Mitt Romney is elected president in November while Republicans hold the House and win a majority in the Senate? Could that be enough to undo Obama's signature legislative accomplishment? Top GOP strategists believe they could essentially gut the law, thanks in part to the wording of Chief Justice John Roberts' controlling opinion. Read the high court's Obamacare ruling . Roberts ruled that the controversial individual mandate -- the core part of the law forcing Americans to pay a fine if they don't have health insurance -- is actually a tax. And a complex congressional rule known as reconciliation would allow Republicans to change certain tax and spending components of the health care law with only a bare Senate majority. ""The chief justice said (the mandate) is a tax, and taxes are clearly what we call reconcilable,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said on Fox News Sunday. ""That's the kind of measure that can be pursued with 51 votes in the Senate. And if I'm the leader of the majority next year, I commit to the American people that the repeal of 'Obamacare' will be job one."" The reconciliation process could also be used to strip funding for the statute, one senior GOP strategist told CNN. Democrats used reconciliation in 2010 to pass a package of amendments to the health care law. Republicans blasted the move at the time, calling it an unreasonable manipulation of the legislative process. Reconciliation matters because in today's sharply polarized political climate, most legislation can't clear the 100-member Senate without a filibuster-proof of majority of 60 votes. Right now, the Republicans control 47 Senate seats. While most political analysts believe the GOP has a decent shot at a net pickup of four seats this fall, almost nobody believes the Republicans can gain 13 seats. In the meantime, top congressional Republicans have latched onto the notion that the individual mandate is a tax -- something GOP leaders believe plays into one of the Democrats' main political weaknesses. Obamacare is ""not a good idea (and) I think you saw one of the reasons why -- because it's a tax increase,"" Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a possible GOP vice presidential nominee, said Saturday. ""It's a massive tax increase on the middle class."" While Democratic leaders still maintain the mandate is not a tax -- instead calling it a penalty -- roughly 60% of Americans believe it is, according to a CNN/ORC International poll released Monday. The poll also notes that while an overwhelming majority of GOP voters oppose the mandate, 55% of independents do as well. Republican Senate candidates are now being told that ""every day you are not talking about (the health care issue) is a day you've wasted,"" according to a Washington-based GOP strategist. One potential wrinkle in any GOP plans to call the individual mandate a new Democratic tax: Romney's health care overhaul in Massachusetts also included a mandate. ""This was a plan that, that Gov. Romney supported,"" White House Chief of Staff Jack Lew said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""It's something that I would think that he would have been proud of."" Pressed on the issue Monday, Romney senior campaign adviser Eric Fehrnstrom told MSNBC that the presumptive GOP presidential nominee agrees ""with the dissent written by Justice (Antonin) Scalia which very clearly stated that the mandate was not a tax."" Fehrnstrom bucks Republican line on 'Obamacare' as 'tax' Asked repeatedly if Romney agrees with Obama and Democrats that the penalty tied to the mandate is not tax, Fehrnstrom eventually said, ""That's correct.""","Republicans say they can use reconciliation to overturn large parts of Obamacare .
Reconciliation lets a bare Senate majority change certain tax and spending rules .
GOP leaders are also using the issue to fire up their conservative base .

"(CNN) -- The lethal Ebola virus has left at least 14 people dead in western Uganda this month, according to Health Ministry officials, after local reports of a ""strange disease"" swept through the region. A total of 20 cases of the virus have been recorded, officials said Saturday. The cases have emerged in Kibaale, a district in midwestern Uganda, where a national task force had been mobilized in an effort to combat the outbreak. Officials from the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control are also supporting that effort, ministry officials say. The Ebola virus is considered a highly infectious disease spread through direct contact with bodily fluids, with symptoms that include fever, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, headache, measles-like rash, red eyes and at times bleeding from body openings. Health officials urged the public to report suspected cases and avoid contact with anyone who has contracted the virus and to disinfect the bedding and clothing of an infected person by using protective gloves and masks. Officials also advised against eating dead animals, especially monkeys, and to avoid public gatherings in the affected district. An explainer on Ebola .

"(CNN) -- The Netherlands is reeling from the death of a volunteer soccer official at an amateur football match over the weekend which has led to three Dutch teenagers being charged with manslaughter. Two 15-year-olds and a 16-year-old -- all Amsterdam club Nieuw Sloten players -- were arrested and charged by Dutch police after the death of a 41-year-old linesman Richard Nieuwenhuizen, who was beaten by players following a match against his club Buitenboys in the city of Almere. Nieuwenhuizen's son was playing in the match when the incident occurred. ""Two 15-year-olds and a 16-year-old from Amsterdam, under suspicion of seriously assaulting a 41-year-old linesman of the Buitenboys from Almere, will on Thursday appear before a judge at the Almere court,"" the prosecutor's office said. ""The suspects will appear on charges of manslaughter, assault and public violence."" The judge will now decide whether to keep the three youths in detention in Amsterdam. Nieuwenhuizen is the second man to die during an amateur football game following the death of a 77-year-old, who was the victim of a karate kick by a 32-year-old footballer during a game on December 3 2011. At a press conference, Bernard Fransen, president of KNVB amateur football, said he was ""very shocked"" by the tragic incident. ""Amateur football matches will be canceled this weekend and a minute's silence will be observed during professional football matches,"" he told reporters. Nieuwenhuizen's death has resonated across the globe with FIFA president Sepp Blatter extending his condolences. ""Football is a mirror of society and sadly, the same ills that afflict society -- in this case violence -- also manifest themselves in our game,"" said Blatter, according to a statement on fifa.com. ""Nevertheless, I remain convinced that football -- through the example set by the tireless efforts of people like Mr Nieuwenhuizen -- is a force for good, and we must continue to use its positive example to educate people against these wrongs."" On its website Nieuw Sloten said it was ""deeply shocked"" by Nieuwenhuizen's death, adding that it would ban for life the players found to be responsible, as well pulling its team from the league and temporarily suspending all operations as a club. ""Violence should not be on the football fields,"" said a statement on the Nieuw Sloten website. ""And certainly not against referees, linesmen and all those others who volunteer each year to help over a million amateur footballers. We must do everything possible to eliminate these excesses. Nieuwenhuizen was pronounced dead at 5.30 p.m. local time on Monday in the hospital of Nieuwegein, according to his club Buitenboys. ""Buitenboys wish the family much strength with this loss,"" said the Buitenboys website. ""The Dutch Football Association is deeply shocked. After intervention of the police and the arrival of an ambulance, he was in critical condition and transported to a hospital. There he died Monday afternoon,"" reported the website of the Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB). The KNVB's director of amateur football, Anton Binnenmars, added: ""Let me, on behalf of the entire KNVB and all its members, offer my sympathy to the families and friends of the victim. It is outrageous that someone enjoying a hobby can be victim of such aggression."" Despite a population of 17.5 million, Holland has built an outstanding reputation for developing young footballers over the years, with its amateur youth clubs providing a strong breeding ground for the country's professional clubs. All amateur football has been cancelled this weekend in Holland.","Three Dutch teenagers charged with manslaughter following death of a soccer official .

"(CNN) -- Should men be routinely screened for prostate cancer? This question has been asked ever since the prostate specific antigen test, or PSA, became widely available more than two decades ago. Central to this question is another question: Does prostate cancer screening save lives? Both questions are hard to answer. Screening clearly helps find cancer. But many of the cancers that are diagnosed and treated do not need to be. Left alone, they will not harm the patient. And some cancers go on to cause death despite treatment. The right question really is: Does screening find some cancers that need to be cured and can be cured? After an exhaustive process, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has announced its final recommendation on PSA-based prostate cancer screening. It finds that the known harms of screening outweigh the potential benefits for men who have no cancer symptoms. It notes that all screening studies have demonstrated considerable harms associated with screening, but only one major study found evidence that screening saves lives -- and that study has some internal inconsistencies. It showed screening saves lives in the Netherlands and Sweden, but not in five other European countries. Even the positive parts of that study did not show a considerable increase in lives saved. The task force's methods are notable for their scientific rigor. A group of experts in prostate cancer and in evidence appraisal systematically reviewed and reported on all the scientific evidence to date on prostate-cancer screening and treatment. The task force, a second group with expertise in preventive medicine and screening, then considered the review and made a preliminary recommendation. That recommendation was made available for public comment last fall. Those comments were then considered before a final recommendation was made. Although the task force recommends against routine screening, it does recognize that some men will still want to be screened because of family history or other concerns. The task force vehemently stresses the necessity of informed consent in such cases: Men must be told of the known harms of screening. Hopefully its strong statement will cause physicians and screening advocates to be more cautious about encouraging screening. For years, professional organizations, including the American Cancer Society, the European Association of Urology, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and even the American Urologic Association, have urged caution and informed decision-making regarding screening. These recommendations have largely been ignored. Over the past 20 years, many well-meaning people have supported mass screening. Celebrities, athletes, politicians and cancer survivors have endorsed screening. Mass screening is commonly conducted in shopping malls, churches and community centers, at conventions and state fairs and in vans parked in supermarket parking lots. News: Task force says PSA tests do more harm than good . Hospitals, medical practices, fraternities, politicians, radio and TV stations and even an adult diaper manufacturer have sponsored mass screenings. Men who attend them are rarely informed of the risks of screening and are often promised unproven benefits. These two decades of mass screening are estimated to have caused more than 1 million American men to receive unnecessary treatment causing numerous common side effects, including radiation-induced bowel injury, urinary incontinence and impotence, and a significant proportion have serious, life-threatening complications. Mass screening is a lucrative business. I am haunted by a conversation I had in the late 1990s with a marketing executive at a major American hospital who bragged about his ""prostate cancer business plan."" His hospital conducted free screening at a local mall every September for Prostate Cancer Awareness Month. He explained that this was not just cheap and effective advertising for his hospital system. It was also a moneymaker. As he explained it, for every 1,000 men over age 50 who were screened at the mall, 145 would have an abnormal screen, and 135 would go to his hospital for evaluation. Fees collected from them would easily cover the cost of the free screening event. About 45 in that group would have cancer; the rest would be false positives. The marketer had figured out how many men would be treated with surgery, radiation, and hormones. He had estimates of all the money the center would make from treating all 45 cancer cases. He knew how many men would be treated for urinary incontinence, and what his net profit for treating that would be. Amazingly, he even knew how many of the men would want penile prostheses surgically implanted to treat their impotence. I asked him one question: ""How many lives will you save if you screen a thousand men?"" He looked at me as if I were a fool, and said, ""Don't you know? No one knows if this stuff saves lives. I can't give you a number on that."" He was right. It would not be until 13 years later, in 2010, that a clinical trial would finally be published suggesting that screening saves lives -- and that trial has internal inconsistencies making that suggestion suspect. Indeed, for two decades, mass PSA-based prostate cancer screening was done in this country without direct clinical evidence showing that it was beneficial to patients. It was, of course, very beneficial to those who offered it. While I hope that this new recommendation will put an end to mass screening, I am not optimistic. As Upton Sinclair once said, ""It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Otis W. Brawley.","Otis Brawley: New report says prostate cancer screenings do more harm than good .

"(CNN) -- The bodies of two French journalists, who were killed in Mali, arrived in France Tuesday, Radio France International reported. Ghislaine Dupont and Claude Verlon worked for Radio France International and were kidnapped Saturday morning. The abduction occurred after the journalists were interviewing a Tuareg rebel near the northern town of Kidal, a local governor said, according to RFI sister network France Info. Both were kidnapped by four men in a Toyota, said Gov. Adama Kamissoko of Kidal. Kidal was one of the strongholds of the Islamic militant Tuareg uprising last year that plunged Mali into chaos after a military-led coup. Following the coup, Tuareg rebels occupied the northern half of the country. Veteran Spanish war correspondent kidnapped in Syria . As part of France's intervention this year to flush out militants in Mali, the French military secured the area around Kidal. The two reporters were abducted in front of the home of a member of the Tuareg rebels' National Movement of a Liberation of Azawad, RFI reported. The two journalists could be heard resisting their abduction, according to their driver, who was forced by the gunmen to lay on the ground, RFI said. French President Francois Hollande called an emergency meeting with ministers Sunday about the incident. Hollande condemned the killings, calling them ""despicable.""

"(CNN) -- Six Chinese Communist Party investigators have been sentenced to between four and 14 years in jail after they drowned a local official during a botched interrogation that has shone light on China's secretive extrajudicial processes. Cheng Wenjie, the deputy director of the Commission for Discipline Inspection in the eastern city of Wenzhou, received the longest sentence of the six for his role in the death of Yu Qiyi, according to a copy of the court verdict given to CNN by the victim's wife. All the defendants pleaded guilty. Yu, 41, the chief engineer at a state-owned company in the same city, died at a local hospital on April 9, a month after being detained over his role in a land deal. After early interrogations failed to yield any admission of guilt, Cheng summoned other investigators April 8 and ordered Yu to strip naked and sit in a bathtub filled with icy water. At Cheng's behest, three other investigators-- Li Xiang, Nan Yu and Gu Chenfu -- grabbed his neck, arms and legs and held him under the water. The two other defendants -- Wu Zhiwei and Zhang Fangchao -- entered the room later the same evening, the verdict said. When Cheng left he told his subordinates: ""I'm leaving now; you all have fun with it."" Yu was sent to hospital an hour later and died at 3am the next day, the verdict, which has not been officially released, said. The court said that the six interrogators attempted to drown Yu in order to force him to admit that he had violated the law. Yu's wife, Wu Qian, told CNN the sentences handed down were not long enough, adding that many important facts about the case had not been aired in court. She said she wanted to plan for her late husband's funeral but the Commission for Discipline Inspection had not returned his remains. Wu Pengbin, a lawyer acting on behalf of the deceased man, said that he had heard the six defendants had appealed their sentences as they believed they were too harsh. Yu was placed under investigation as part of a secretive process known as shanggui or dual designation that allows for Communist Party members to be detained and interrogated by Party investigators. It is based on the Party's own regulations rather than laws and procedures, making it even less transparent than China's judicial system. Legal experts view the prosecution of Yu's interrogators as a step forward but say that the key to preventing similar abuses is to address the root cause of his death - the rarely publicized shanggui system. ""The six investigators arrested were mere scapegoats,"" Pu Zhiqiang, one of the lawyers representing the Yu family, told CNN in September. ""Shuanggui is an illegal process -- abuse and torture during interrogation have become standard operating procedure.""

"(CNN) -- Lance Armstrong may be associated with cycling and doping allegations, but for many, his greatest strides have been against cancer. The cancer awareness organization that Armstrong founded, the Lance Armstrong Foundation, has been flooded with supportive e-mails and calls in the last 12 hours, said Doug Ulman, its president and CEO. Armstrong announced late Thursday that he would give up his fight against charges of illegal doping, allegations that he has repeatedly denied. The messages range from ""I'm more committed now than I ever have been"" to ""I'm so sorry you guys have had to deal with this issue, can't wait to be more supportive in the future,"" Ulman said. A lot of notes from cancer survivors say they'll never forget how helpful the foundation has been for them. ""Things like that -- that's the motivation, that's what keeps us focused on our work, and ultimately that's the result of Lance founding this 15 years ago, and his leadership ever since,"" Ulman said. Early Friday, the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency said it was banning Armstrong from cycling competitions for life and negated his wins since 1998, but this move may not be the final word. The International Cycling Union has claimed it has jurisdiction, questioning the agency's authority. Your top Armstrong questions answered . ""People are just so supportive of Lance, they're so supportive of the mission of the organization, and I think, ultimately a lot of people are ready and just are relieved to put this aside, so that we can focus on our work,"" Ulman said. Livestrong, the foundation's popular brand name, is receiving even more donations than last year and is on track to raise between $45 million and $50 million for 2012, Ulman said. All told, the organization, which turns 15 in October, is approaching $500 million in fund-raising during its lifetime. And more than 100,000 people have engaged in an awareness-raising activity such as running, walking or riding in the name of Livestrong. A November report from Livestrong said that in a survey of nearly 10,000 people, 72% said they had worn one of the organization's wristbands or purchased other merchandise. And 44% had donated to Livestrong, while 22% had engaged in a Livestrong event. The survey included cancer survivors and their family members. ""Livestrong has been, and hopefully will continue to be, a very positive force in the anti-cancer community,"" said Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society and CNN.com conditions expert, in an e-mail. ""They have stressed support for cancer research and support for the cancer patient,"" Brawley said. ""They have emphasized that the success of medical research has created a number of young cancer survivors with unique needs that medicine needs to address."" Lance Armstrong: Cancer won't wait . Armstrong found out he had testicular cancer at age 25 when he was emerging as a rising star among cyclists. He started a small group to raise money for cancer called the Lance Armstrong Foundation in 1997. Ulman, also a cancer survivor, had no idea who Armstrong was at that time, but the cyclist contacted him after reading about the work Ulman was doing with young adults with cancer. ""He basically just said, 'Hey, I think we have a lot in common. And I'm trying to get my foundation off the ground,' "" Ulman recalled. ""'If there's anything we can ever do together, let me know.' "" In 2001, Ulman joined the Lance Armstrong Foundation as its fourth employee. The organization had been focused on putting on bike rides, raising money and starting partnerships. The foundation started a program to provide support and education to people who had recently been diagnosed with cancer. After a series of focus groups, the name Livestrong emerged for the program. In 2004, Nike wanted to honor Armstrong and the foundation with a yellow wristband. The name Livestrong seemed fitting for it, Ulman said. What's behind the Armstrong headlines? The wristbands have been far-reaching. Ulman said they hit a tipping point where people wanted to express that they were part of the community as well as the fight against cancer. ""We've really democratized philanthropy, and really given an opportunity for everyone to participate,"" Ulman said. ""You only needed to have a dollar to be part of this movement, and more than 85 million people have joined since then. ""That's what in life I think a lot of us search for,"" he added. ""We just search for a way to give back and be a part of something bigger than any one of us."" Nike said in a recent statement that it would not drop support for Armstrong in response to the latest chapter of Armstrong's doping saga. The company said: ""Lance has stated his innocence and has been unwavering on this position. Nike plans to continue to support Lance and the Lance Armstrong Foundation, a foundation that Lance created to serve cancer survivors."" The organization has gained more prominence as Armstrong became more famous as a cyclist, scoring seven Tour de France victories from 1999 to 2005. Armstrong and the tenuous nature of heroism . ""His visibility has given us opportunities that we would have never had access to,"" Ulman said. ""In our lifetime, for sure, there has not been another athlete that has done more for a cause than Lance has."" Armstrong is his foundation's biggest single individual donor, having contributed more than $6 million over time, Ulman said. The cyclist's legal case over the doping allegations does not get financial support from the foundation. Today, Armstrong's foundation has more than 100 employees and thousands of volunteers globally. A team of 12 ""navigators,"" most of them social workers, answer questions about cancer, returning phone calls within 24 hours. Armstrong is serving a term as chairman of the foundation's board. He speaks to Ulman several times a day, and he participates in some way in the organization's work on a daily basis. His activities include giving speeches and talking to survivors. In October at the TEDMED conference in Coronado, California, Armstrong said that what every cancer patient wants is to be heard. ""They want me to sit there, look at them in the eye and feel their story,"" he said. Lance Armstrong Foundation boss on beating cancer three times .

"ULAANBAATAR, Mongolia (CNN) -- Standing slightly more than 4 feet tall, 9-year-old Tuguldur proudly stated the greatest challenge he faced in a horse race across the Mongolian plains in the country's annual Naadam Festival was serenading his horse. Young wrestlers cheer on teammates during the opening round at the Naadam Festival. ""The hardest part of the race was singing to my horse while riding,"" said Tuguldur, wiping perspiration from the July sun off his face. The long-distance horse race is exclusively for children, ranging in ages from 6 to 12. Riding up to 30 kilometers (19 miles), these children maneuver their galloping steeds on a thin saddle pad that often does not have stirrups. ""Mongolians believe they can communicate with their horses through singing, and their horse will go faster,"" said Tamir, a senior at Mongolian University. ""This is why the kids must keep singing during the race."" Singing to racing horses is just one part of Mongolia's Naadam Festival, an annual event believed to have existed for centuries, and rivaling the Olympics as the premier sporting event in the central Asian nation. ""For us Mongolians, the Naadam Festival is what we look forward to all year,"" said Dashtsogtsol Erdenetuya, who has competed in the Naadam Festival for the past 22 years. ""It is our tradition and a reminder of an ancient way of life. Getting gold in this festival brings as much honor as any Olympic medal."" Held every July, the Naadam Festival was possibly founded as long ago as 800 years ago by Genghis Khan. The festival is believed to have started as a way for Mongols to train for military and hunting expeditions. Today, it formally commemorates the 1921 revolution when Mongolia declared itself a free country. Many of Naadam's customs, which include wearing traditional clothes and singing hymns once sung in battle, are still followed, a sign of the importance of the festival. ""In the Naadam Festival, everyone knows who you are; many companies will sponsor you, and if you win, you can become the face of the country,"" said Nasanbat Oyunbat, director of the Mongolian Olympic National Team. ""The Olympics are only now becoming popular in Mongolia and were televised for the first time in the 2004 Games in Athens."" ""The horses in the Naadam Festival have higher endurance than the horses that will compete in the Olympic Equestrian events in August,"" bragged Edward Rochette, an American lawyer who married a Mongolian woman and is living in Ulaanbaatar. ""Most thoroughbreds would die if you ran them for 30 km. The Mongolian horses have been running across these plains for hundreds of years and have developed the correct body type for this kind of sport."" Rochette's wife's family lives in a yurt (round animal skin tent), owns more than 1,500 and entered 20 horses in the three-day race competition this year, which was visited by thousands of tourists. ""I was overwhelmed watching the clouds of dust rise across the prairie as the horses galloped to the finish line,"" explained Miep Thulijls, a tourist from Holland. ""I could not believe these tiny kids could ride for so long and was terrified when I saw one of the children fall off his horse like a rag doll."" The age limit was raised from 4 to 6 after a child was killed in a race a few years ago. Only small children are allowed to compete in this event because they are particularly light. The kids are generally rewarded with warm mare's milk and candy while the horse owners get money and sometimes even cars. Wrestling without weight limits . Mongolian wrestling has no weight divisions; a time limit was only introduced after a match went on for more than four hours. Wrestlers compete in single elimination events and are weeded down from 512 participants during nine rounds of competition. ""It is more difficult to wrestle the little guys because they are so quick,"" complained Gantogtokh, who at 130 kilos (286 pounds) is an eighth-generation wrestler. His father placed second in Judo in the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico. Dressed in tight blue shorts and a half shirt, which is usually red or blue, the wrestlers dance around the judges in slow graceful sways and then pay homage to the nine flags dating back to Genghis Khan before and after each match. It is rumored that the dress code, which requires wrestlers to compete without shirts was imposed after a female participated in the event disguised as a man. Many of the male athletes who compete in the free style wrestling and judo events in the Olympic Games were once Naadam Festival winners. But, the Olympic gold medal hopeful this year is a female Judo wrestler. ""Each generation of wrestlers gets stronger as they have more opportunities to work out,"" Gantogtokh said. ""I hope this year we will bring home a gold in Judo and wrestling. But, the competition is going to be tough."" Arrows to anklebones . Other athletes participated in archery and anklebone shooting. ""This has always been my dream,"" beamed Dashtsogtsol Erdenetuya, 36, who has competed in the Naadam Festival for the past 22 years. ""I placed second the past three years and finally came in first this time. My mother was a champion in 1969 and 1975 and taught me everything I know about archery."" Archery is usually the only event in which women compete. Men shoot from 75 meters and women from 65 meters. Mongolians sing to the archers and stand on either side of the targets. The singers, dressed in elaborate decor, sing three different types of songs, including an invitational song and songs that recognize a good or bad shot. Famous for his ability to shoot backward on horseback, Genghis Khan created the sport of anklebone shooting to strengthen the middle finger of his soldiers, so they would be better skilled in archery. Anklebone shooting is the newest event in the Naadam Festival, only becoming an official sport in 2000. ""The game is becoming more modern now,"" explained Khatanbator, 56, an anklebone participant."" Competitors now use pieces of deer antler instead of anklebones. It is easier on the wrist to flick than anklebones. But, everyone still refers to the sport as anklebone shooting because it has been this way for hundreds of years."" The competitors are divided into teams of eight who compete against each other. The first to knock all the deer chips down wins. ""People cheer for the other competitor like fans would in a soccer game,"" explained Berkfat Tumenjin, a Mongolian tour guide. ""While the singing in other events is used to encourage competitors, the singing in this event is used to distract them.""","Naadam Festival is held every July in Mongolia .

"(CNN) -- A judge ruled Monday that three HIV-positive women in Namibia were sterilized without their informed consent, their lawyer said. But the high court judge said the women did not provide enough evidence to prove that they were sterilized because they were HIV-positive, according to attorney Amon Ngavetene. The judge has not yet decided on awarding damages in the case, said Ngavetene, coordinator of the AIDS Law Unit at the Legal Assistance Centre. The women were seeking 1.2 million Namibian dollars (about $150,000) in compensation. The center is representing 18 women, alleging that public hospitals sterilized them without their informed consent. Namibian authorities have denied accusations that forced sterilizations have been a matter of government policy. Emilia Handumbo, one of the HIV-positive women suing the government, told CNN last year that she was given documents to sign while she was in labor and about to give birth in a public hospital. Watch: Forced sterilization in Africa . ""I thought they were papers for the caesarian, but then the nurse said to me, 'I think they are going to close you,'"" she said. Thanks to anti-AIDS drugs, Handumbo gave birth to a healthy, HIV-negative baby. But then the letters ""BTL"" appeared in her hospital file. The letters, she later learned, stood for bilateral tubal ligation, a form of sterilization. Attorney Corinna van Wyk said Handumbo is one of many women who are victims of a broken health system. ""Doctors are taking advantage of them,"" van Wyk said. 'The damage is permanent, obviously, not only physically. These women are discriminated against culturally because they can no longer bear children,"" she said. Human rights groups say that the high profile nature of Monday's case has done little to change the conduct of some health care workers in Namibia, alleging that more HIV-positive women who claim they were forcibly sterilized are still coming forward. A study from the International Community of Women Living with HIV/AIDS and the Namibia Women's Health Network unearthed 40 cases in three of the country's regions. AIDS activist Jenny Gatsi-Mallet, who helped conduct the research, said doctors working for the state have told her they were just following guidelines. ""They are saying that these guidelines came into being when AIDS first came into the country, and I think that was in 2001, and it was a directive that says any woman who tests positive for HIV should be sterilized straight away,"" Gatsi-Mallet said. But Dr. Norbert Forster, deputy permanent secretary of Namibia's health ministry, told CNN last year that the sterilization of HIV-positive women was ""not at all"" an official policy. ""That is not our position,"" he said, adding that forcing women to sign consent documents ""would not be in line"" with the government's policy.

"(CNN) -- Tony Stark may have started out as a Batman knockoff -- like Bruce Wayne he's a playboy entrepreneur, a mega-rich industrialist who inherited the good life before channeling his anger into homeland security -- but there's no doubt that in the movies Robert Downey Jr. has put clear blue water between Tony and Christian Bale's grim, angst-y Batman. Flashy and frivolous, an exhibitionist who likes the glare of public attention, he's a light knight with a thick skin. Traditionally, protagonists are punished for their hubris, and the first ""Iron Man"" movie went through those motions. But Downey enjoys Stark's arrogance too much to eat humble pie. He's always resisted the idea of playing the repentant. Stark may have developed a conscience after his run-in with the Taliban in the first movie, and even turned monogamous for Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow), but he's still a flip, cynical hedonist at heart. So what are we to make of the anxiety attacks that cripple Mr. Stark in Shane Black's ""Iron Man 3""? Apparently he's freaked out after his mind-blowing experiences with ""The Avengers"" last summer (though no one else seems concerned that Norse gods are at large in the cosmos, and when the going gets tough you do wonder why he doesn't pick up the phone and ask his new buddies for help -- not the only plot hole by any means). Black, who wrote ""Lethal Weapon"" way back when and more recently helped restore Downey's career with ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang,"" may have hoped that a sliver of self-doubt would crack open Iron Man's emotional armor and restore the human face behind the mask, but Downey shows no interest in introspection. Black systematically strips Tony of almost everything he has -- gadgets, gizmos, his strongest suit -- but the actor merely shrugs it off. There's a lot of faulty wiring this time round, technology that seems as flawed as its inventor, but if his problems are largely of his own making Tony remains supremely unfazed, always primed with a quip and a smirk. Downey may as well be playing ""Irony Man."" Stark's arrogance and narcissism come back to haunt him in the form of spurned entrepreneur Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) and a larger-than-life terror-monger by the name of ""The Mandarin"" (Ben Kingsley). A cross between Osama bin Laden and Fu Manchu -- but with the rumbling, tumbling vocal stylings of a Southern Baptist evangelist, The Mandarin brings out the best in Kingsley, who hasn't had a role as juicy as this one for donkey's years. Mandarin is a worthy nemesis, an extravagant showman like Tony who can hack into broadcast feeds at will, and claims credit for a string of bombings across the U.S. When Hap (Jon Favreau) is caught in one blast, Tony takes it as a personal affront -- and impetuously calls fire down on his own head. There's an off-the-cuff quality to the storytelling here -- the movie rewrites its own laws of physics whenever it's convenient to do so -- which by rights should be a bigger problem than it is. But Black and/or co-writer Drew Pearce know how to write snappy dialogue. Even if they don't mean a thing, their scenes have plenty of zing. They also have an ace up their sleeve, a trump card that puts a giddy spin on the third act at just that point where both the previous movies began to run out of stream. To say more would be to spoil the fun. ""Iron Man 3"" has plenty to offer on that score. It's a confidently tongue-in-cheek piece of blockbuster engineering, sweetly calibrated to Downey's cavalier appeal and to Kingsley's oddball interjections, a battle royale of rampant egos in which acting speaks louder than words.","In the new film Iron Man is pitted against The Mandarin .

"(CNN) -- Dustin Johnson was left frustrated after two lapses gave his rivals hope of stopping the American from running away with the biggest victory of his golf career in China. The 29-year-old will take a three-shot lead into the final round of the $8.5 million HSBC Champions tournament in Shanghai, but two double-bogeys -- the second at his last hole -- took the gloss off a six-under-par 66 peppered with 10 birdies. It meant that Ian Poulter's sparkling 63 in Saturday's third round put the Englishman in an even better position to emulate Tiger Woods -- the only player to defend a World Golf Championship title. ""I'm still a little mad from my double-bogey on 18,"" Johnson told reporters at Sheshan International Golf Club. ""Obviously to have a three-shot lead going into the last day is good and I am looking forward to the challenge. I still have to play really well. ""If you told me teeing off I would shoot six under I would have taken it, but I obviously left a few shots out there. I'm definitely happy with what I shot. Obviously I'm just not happy with the way I finished."" Johnson, who had led by five at the halfway stage of the co-sanctioned tournament, is seeking to add to his seven PGA Tour victories, the last of which came in Hawaii in January. ""Making two doubles, there's no excuse for that,"" he said. ""Especially the way I'm playing right now, it shouldn't happen. But 66 is still a good day and I did make 10 birdies, so I hit a lot of great shots."" Poulter was second on 15 under, carding an eagle and eight birdies -- five of them in a row. ""I guess the only blemish for me, which leaves a bit of a sour taste, was three-putting 17, and actually missing a couple of opportunities,"" said Poulter, who is chasing the $1.2 million first prize to boost his hopes of reaching the European Tour's Race to Dubai finale. This is the second of four events leading to the 60-man shootout, with the standings headed by the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup champion Henrik Stenson. The Swede was tied for 58th after his best round this week -- a 67 following 76 and 74. He could be overtaken by second-placed Graeme McDowell, who is third in Shanghai after a 64 put him a shot behind Poulter. The Northern Irishman's only major win came at the 2010 U.S. Open, where he hunted down Johnson on the final day when the U.S. Ryder Cup player also had a three-stroke advantage. ""From here it looks like Dustin is going to have to beat himself for anybody to have a chance to catch him,"" McDowell said. ""Race to Dubai points will be very important to me; I have a lot to play for tomorrow. If not the trophy, second place will certainly be worth my while."" Former world No. 1 Rory McIlroy shot 67 to be tied for fourth with U.S. Open champion Justin Rose and Canadian Graham DeLaet, who both carded 65. Martin Kaymer, another player who has topped the rankings, climbed to a tie for seventh with former Masters champion Bubba Watson and another American, Boo Weekley. The German had been on course for the holy grail of 59, but had to settle for 62 after parring his last three holes. British Open champion Phil Mickelson was tied for 22nd after a three-bogey, three-birdie 72. Masters titleholder Adam Scott is back home ahead of next week's Australian PGA, while world No. 1 Woods will return to action for the third Race to Dubai Final Series event in Turkey.","American golfer Dustin Johnson leads by three shots ahead of final round in Shanghai .

"(CNN) -- A national breast cancer charity is being accused of using misleading statistics to convince women to have mammograms, according to a paper published Thursday in the British Medical Journal. Susan G. Komen for the Cure's mammography campaign during breast cancer awareness month last October has come under fire from professors Steven Woloshin and Lisa Schwartz at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice, who say the foundation overstated the benefits of the procedure and totally ignored the risks. ""The ad implies that mammograms have a huge effect, but the only evidence that they use is the five-year survival rate for breast cancer when caught early is 98% and when it's not, 23%,"" Woloshin said. ""The problem is that in the context of screening survival, statistics are meaningless."" ""To make an informed decision, you not only have to know the benefits you have to know the harm. And the ad does not say anything about harm, it just gives you this exaggerated benefit statistic,"" Woloshin said. ""Screening is a genuine decision people need to make and they can only make it if they have the facts. It doesn't mean that screening is not good, it means it does good and it does harm. Some people can benefit and some will get hurt, and the harm is just as real as the benefit."" A teaching moment about politics and Komen . Woloshin and Schwartz write a series that highlights exaggerations, distortions and selective reporting in advertising, news stories and medical journals that are misleading. They say the problem in Komen's case is using survival statistics to determine the benefit of screening. ""There is no correlation between changes in survival and changes in how many people die."" Woloshin said. ""Twenty to 50% of women who get screened every year end up having at least one false alarm over 10 years, and 5-20% actually end up having to have a biopsy to rule out cancer. ""The most important harm is overdiagnosis -- screening can find cancers that were never destined to cause harm because it grows so slowly or can go away on its own,"" he said. ""It would never have harmed you, you would never have known about it and you would have lived your whole life and died from something else. These people get treated. They get radiation, chemotherapy, surgery and it's all unnecessary. "" Woloshin also says the Komen ad ignores the problems with screening. He says for every life saved by screening two to 10 women are 'overdiagnosed', suffer anxiety and undergo unnecessary radiation, chemotherapy or surgery. He said in the end, it all boils down to this: ""You can't make a good decision unless you have the basic facts. It exaggerated the benefit and it ignored the harm."" Experimental drug offers new way to battle certain breast cancer . But Komen, the world's largest breast cancer charity, says while mammography isn't perfect, it's still the best detection tool available. ""We have long advocated for women to be informed about the benefits and risks of early detection and treatment,"" said Chandini Portteus, Komen's vice president of research, evaluation and scientific programs. ""The numbers are not in question. Early detection allows for early treatment, which gives women the best chance of surviving breast cancer."" Since its inception in 1982, the organization -- creator of the ""pink ribbon,"" a symbol of breast cancer awareness and the official symbol of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month -- has invested nearly $2 billion in research. ""We've said for years that science has to do better, which is why Komen is putting millions of dollars into research to detect breast cancer before symptoms start -- through biomarkers, for example,"" said Portteus. ""Komen also is funding research to help accurately predict which tumors will spread and which won't. While we invest in getting those answers, we think it's simply irresponsible to effectively discourage women from taking steps to know what's going on with their health."" Portteus said Komen encourages women to work with their health care providers to find out what's right for them. But according to Woloshin, a recent survey he and his colleagues conducted showed even doctors mistake improved survival as proof that screening saves lives. ""The survival statistics are confusing for doctors, too,"" he said. ""This is a real communication problem that doctors and patients alike face, so whenever you hear about survival statistics in the context of screening, you should ignore them. ""The only way to know if a screening test works is if it is proven in a randomized trial that shows that less people die because of screening."" 'Overdiagnosis' of breast cancer may be higher than thought . Dr. Stephanie Bernik, chief of surgical oncology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York, said none of this is new. ""It is not uncommon in the medical field for researchers, doctors and health care professionals to use statistics in a way that advances their point of view. Results can be spun to be either favorable or unfavorable, depending on one's stance,"" Bernik said. ""The Komen foundation is doing nothing new by presenting data that supports their position in a favorable light. Although there is controversy regarding the absolute benefit of mammography screening in many studies, most breast surgeons stand behind the Komen foundation's stance that screening mammography saves lives,"" Bernik said. ""We all agree that screening increases the number of procedures that are performed, but finding a tumor at an earlier stage cannot be worse than finding it when it is larger."" ""Lead-time"" bias can also contribute to misrepresentation of mammography's advantages, according to the National Breast Cancer Coalition (NBCC), a group of patient and professional organizations. This means, for example, if deadly cancer is found early through screening, it may seem like the patient lived longer because of ""lead-time."" But the coalition says this makes screening appear more beneficial than it is, because testing is actually detecting tumors that have a better prognosis. ""NBCC believes that there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against universal screening mammography in any age group of women,"" according to the organization's website. ""Women who have symptoms of breast cancer such as a lump, pain or nipple discharge should seek a diagnostic mammogram. The decision to undergo screening for asymptomatic women must be made on an individual level based on a woman's personal preferences, family history and risk factors. ""Mammography does not prevent or cure breast cancer, and has many limitations,"" the website says. ""Women are told that mammography screening saves lives, but the evidence of a mortality (death rate) reduction from screening is conflicting and continues to be questioned by some scientists, policy makers and members of the public."" Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, said he understands Woloshin and Schwartz's message. ""It is very, very difficult to convey information about screening, especially mammography, and convey it accurately,"" Brawley told CNN. ""In the American Cancer Society's screening recommendations, the first paragraph recommends women over the age of 40 get a mammogram annually. The second paragraph says that women should be told the limitations of screening. ... Some of the folks at Komen are trying to do the right thing, and I just respect how difficult that is.""","A paper accuses the Susan G. Komen foundation of using misleading statistics .

"New York (CNN) -- New York City police are investigating the death of a Mexican diplomat's 4-month-old son who was taken to a hospital with bruises on his body, authorities said Wednesday. The infant, Eduardo Rocha Ovalle, was unresponsive when his parents took him to NYU Medical Center about 9 p.m. Tuesday, police said. The baby was declared dead about half an hour after arriving at the hospital. The Consulate General of Mexico in New York confirmed that the baby's father is ""credited as part of the consular staff."" The identities of the parents were not released. New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly told reporters Wednesday that investigators were awaiting autopsy results but that an official from the medical examiner's office declared the death ""somewhat suspicious"" after examining the body at the hospital. ""There were bruises on the baby's body, and the investigation is going forward,"" Kelly told a news conference. In its statement, the Mexican consulate said, ""As required by international law, we will offer all assistance and consular protection required by the parents under these circumstances and the Consulate will closely monitor the developments in this case. We are in contact with the relevant U.S. authorities."" The consulate declined to comment further. ""The case will be treated in accordance with the local legal system,"" the statement said. Referring to the father's diplomatic status, Kelly said: ""His only diplomatic immunity, if you will, is pursuant to his official duty."" Wanda Hernandez, 52, superintendent of the building where the infant lived with his parents, told CNN affiliate NY1 that at about 1 a.m. Wednesday police questioned her about the family after the baby's death. ""I stood in shock,"" she said. ""Because she seemed like a very good mother, and she, like, adores that baby. You know she adores him. I remember her taking pictures and every time ... I say, 'How's the baby?' and she would show me pictures of the baby. For Halloween, she would dress him up."" Hernandez added, ""They looked excited ... she seemed very happy with the baby."" No arrests have been made, Kelly said, and the special victims unit is handling the case. ""We have no cause of death at this time,"" Kelly said.

"(CNN) -- Is Sepp Blatter angling for another term as head of world football? The 77-year-old vowed at the 2011 FIFA presidential elections, where he stood unopposed after a bribery controversy ruled out his only rival, that this would be his fourth and final four-year stint in office. However, this week he hinted that he has ""a mission"" to fulfill and said he feels ""young enough to be in this office."" And he fueled speculation that he may stand again with comments in Friday's release of the FIFA Weekly magazine, in which he said the African and Asian regions deserved more representation at World Cup finals. Blatter, who has stayed in power since 1998 by vowing to take FIFA's showpiece tournament to all parts of the world, criticized Europe's overwhelming presence in relation to its lesser number of member associations. Europe will have 13 of the 32 places on offer in Brazil next year, while South America has four plus the possibility of another via a playoff with fifth-best Asian side (Uruguay vs. Jordan). Africa has five berths, while CONCACAF has three plus a playoff with the top Oceania team (Mexico vs. New Zealand). ""From a purely sporting perspective, I would like to see globalization finally taken seriously, and the African and Asian national associations accorded the status they deserve at the FIFA World Cup,"" Blatter wrote in an article looking at the future of the sport. ""It cannot be that the European and South American confederations lay claim to the majority of the berths at the World Cup (18 or 19 teams), because taken together they account for significantly fewer member associations (63) than Africa and Asia (100)."" Blatter argues that Africa will never fulfill its promise on the biggest stage unless it is given more opportunities. ""Africa, the confederation with the most member associations (54), is woefully under-represented at the World Cup with just five places. As long as this remains the case, African sides may never win an intercontinental trophy, regardless of progress on the playing side,"" he said. ""This flawed state of affairs must be rectified. At the end of the day, an equal chance for all is the paramount imperative of elite sport."" Blatter's attempts to curry favor with his traditional powerbase could be seen as the beginning of a bid to sound out support for another tilt at the presidency, according to Spanish football journalist Begona Perez. ""I think that's Blatter being Blatter. Every time he makes a statement there are second thoughts,"" she told CNN World Sport. ""Maybe he might be thinking he needs his African friends to run for a new presidential election. He's trying to be nice to people he needs for a vote. ""With him you never know, but he works well behind the scenes."" Having given North America its first staging in 1994, FIFA's bid to take the World Cup to new countries continued two years later, while Blatter was still its General Secretary, when South Korea and Japan were awarded the 2002 tournament -- the first time it was held in Asia. Africa's turn came in 2010 when South Africa was host, and the Middle East will get a go in 2022 when Qatar will stage it -- a controversial decision that has led to a likelihood the event will be switched from its traditional summer slot due to the Gulf state's intense heat. Russia will be the first East European nation to host the World Cup in 2018, and it has come under scrutiny already due to the country's new legislation that many say discriminates against gay people -- FIFA's statutes forbid this in member nations. Russia also has a problem with racist behavior by its football fans, which was highlighted this week when CSKA Moscow was charged by European football's ruling body UEFA after Manchester City's Yaya Toure complained of being targeted with monkey chants. Toure, whose Ivory Coast team is hoping to qualify for a third successive World Cup in Brazil, suggested a boycott for 2018 if Russia could not stamp out its racist elements. However, Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho said Friday that such an action would be a backward step. ""I respect his opinion, but I disagree. The history of football was made equally by many races. And the black players have a fantastic contribution of what football is,"" the Portuguese told reporters ahead of his team's English Premier League clash with City on Sunday. ""The World Cup is the biggest expression of national team competitions - races, people from different parts of the globe, people from every continent. And the black players are very, very important for that. ""Who is more important, the billions of people in love with the game around the world? Or a few thousand that go to football stadiums and have disgraceful behavior in relation to black players. ""If I was a black player I would say the other billions are much more important, so let's fight the thousands, but let's give to the billions what the billions want. And the billions want the best football -- and the best football without black players is not the best football, for sure."" Blatter also said Friday that he is against boycotts. ""Boycott has never given us any solutions. You cannot run away from problems,"" he told students during an address at England's Oxford University, where he did not give any more hints about standing for re-election.","Sepp Blatter says Africa is under-represented at the World Cup finals .

"(CNN) -- I'd be lying if I said I didn't wish for a miracle when I was staring down a catastrophic illness almost five years ago. Of course I did. Though I was being treated by brilliant physicians, my survival odds were still frightening. In search of my miracle, I participated in my fair share of odd, nutty and mind-bogglingly irrational activities -- some of which I continue to swear by, but most of which I'm more than a bit embarrassed to admit. I was routinely stuck with needles from head to toe. For a period of time I swallowed up to 100 capsules a day. I was once alternately frozen, baked and then massaged while half-naked by an elderly Middle Eastern man who, to my horror, reminded me of my father. I hugged trees for energy. I also ""vibed,"" which was basically sitting in a cold basement with a space heater, in front of a starship engine-looking machine with its lights flashing on and off, alongside a few sick people, a couple of depressed people and a cat who apparently wasn't feeling well, either. Like Alice I went down the rabbit hole. And I did it gladly, happily, and mostly with a good sense of humor -- because (a) I was going to leave no stone unturned in my quest to live; and (b) I came to realize that much of what I thought I knew about medicine, food and healing was either wrong or grossly incomplete. Do I believe in these phenomena, far outside the realms of science -- energy and vibrational medicine, spiritual healing, the mind-body connection -- that may be, as my beloved old editor used to say, ""just too woo-woo""? Let's say I am simultaneously hopeful, but uncertain; curious, but skeptical. In short, I'm optimistic. I am joined in my optimism by almost 40% of adult Americans who, according to the National Institutes of Health's Center for Complementary and Alternative Health, have used a broad range of unconventional therapies, from energy medicine to herbal supplements. Walking an unusual path to wellness is fraught with doubt, even more so because the resistance often comes from doctors and families, and late-night visits to websites crying ""fraud"" and ""quack"" about anything and everything even vaguely outside their strict definition of medicine. Large, randomized, controlled clinical trials have long been held up as the gold standard in medical research. But clinical trials are wildly expensive and notoriously reductionist in their approach. Not to mention that things that cannot be patented -- beets, meditation, exercise and deep breathing, to name a few -- and therefore, produced profitably, are unlikely to be the subject of any such trial. (Hence the rallying cry, ""Patients over patents!"") Just this week, the American Cancer Society released nutrition and physical activity guidelines for cancer patients, stating that ""New scientific evidence has emerged since 2006 on the relationship between nutrition, physical activity, and issues of quality of life, comorbid conditions, cancer recurrence, the development of second primary cancers, and overall survival."" Recognizing the need for a holistic approach, more and more researchers -- like MD Anderson's Dr. Lorenzo Cohen -- are undertaking novel, standardized and integrative studies. Cohen and his colleagues, for example, have designed and are raising funds for a randomized, integrative oncology intervention program for women with stage 3 breast cancer that will include dietary recommendations, physical activity, stress management, social support and control of environmental contaminants. Many major medical centers have also come around to the importance of an integrative approach to healing by adding complementary specialists and services to their offerings. That most of these integrative units remain essentially toothless when it comes to developing treatment protocols is a shame. At some point we will recognize that our wonderful and already-overwhelmed doctors can't be all things to all people, and we will seek and incorporate the advice of certified nutritionists, naturopaths, energy medicine practitioners and others into regimens for the treatment of disease. (And while we're at it, maybe we can even dream that our health insurance will cover part of it, and that alternative and complementary medicine won't just be the privilege of those who can pay for it out of pocket.) But even without the hard evidence, people believe. The Mayo Clinic's website states: ""[I]t isn't always possible to find good studies about alternative medicine practices. Keep in mind that a lack of evidence doesn't necessarily mean a treatment doesn't work -- but it does mean it hasn't been proved."" Ultimately, though, the proof is in the pudding. Like for the young Texas state representative who recently told me that his physician wanted to put him on medication for a painful and debilitating colitis he had suffered from for several years. ""I said, 'How long will I have to be on these drugs?' And he told me, for the rest of your life! For the rest of my life!"" The representative declined and instead began a diet protocol he found through an online support group. ""I was symptom-free within three days. This was about a year ago. I called my doctor and said, 'I am mad at you.'"" Or for the California life and leadership coach who has twice made the pilgrimage to see John of God, the Brazilian spiritual healer -- the first time as he struggled in the aftermath of the breakup of a significant relationship and then again to work on deeply held beliefs about achievement, success and happiness. He found the stress was beginning to affect him physically. ""I came away with a greater trust in the divine and the understanding that it's all one big learning experience, that we all make mistakes and are doing what we can with what we know and have."" So much of the stress he was feeling was directly related to his doubts. As his anxiety lifted, the physical symptoms began to disappear as well. These types of healing certainly challenge our conventional boundaries of medicine, and yet an overwhelming number of people offer testimony to their efficacy. Dr. Anne Harrington, a Harvard professor and science historian, is the author of a fascinating book, ""The Cure Within."" The book contains a chapter that tracks several historical instances of extraordinary healing, including in the village of Lourdes in southwestern France, where in 1858 a young peasant girl named Bernadette Soubirous claimed that a woman dressed in white (said to be the Virgin Mary) had appeared and asked her to convey important spiritual messages to the community. The apparition led the child to a freshwater spring, where locals began to report healings after contact with the water. Almost 20 years later, the papacy officially recognized Lourdes as a holy place of healing. Pilgrims continue to flood to the Lourdes grotto and there are still reports of ""remarkable healings,"" investigated by the Lourdes Medical Bureau, which is made up of a panel of physicians. A variety of mental and physical cures, including from cases of multiple sclerosis, heart disease, deafness and blindness, sarcomas and paralysis, have been confirmed by the doctors. Confirmed, but not explained. What do you make of these extraordinary healings? I asked Harrington recently. What I think, she said, is that we don't know how vast and powerful we are on our own terms. ""There is enormous mystery and power already in being human ... and the capacity that humans have to transform themselves and to be in relationships that are transformative. That I don't have any doubt about. We understand even just that so imperfectly."" Are we sometimes overly optimistic about these things, almost as if we are attempting to chase down a miracle? To be sure. But optimism is not a bad thing. Dr. David Servan-Schreiber, author of the bestselling book, ""Anticancer: A new way of life,"" famously said that while he did not believe in false hope, he also did not believe in false hopelessness. Servan-Schreiber died from the recurrence of brain cancer last year, nearly 20 years after the discovery of the malignant brain tumor that had been pronounced terminal at diagnosis. Nor is uncertainty a bad thing. It is, after all, the foundation of scientific inquiry. Science, says neuroscientist Beau Lotto, is not a collection of facts set in stone. It advances by testing its assumptions. It begins with questions and observations. It begins with being open to possibilities and comfortable with uncertainty. Here's the thing about miracles: They only truly belong to the people who experienced them, who witnessed and perceived them with their own senses. Everyone else either accepts the miracle on faith or as a compelling possibility. Or not at all. It would appear as though I got the miracle I had wished for, though I could not begin to tell you how. For me it's a tangle of the intangible, the inexplicable and the mysterious. And I'm perfectly comfortable with that.","NIH center says 40% of Americans have used some form of alternative medicine .

"(CNN) -- The Ebola virus has killed 10 people in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the World Health Organization said Tuesday. As of Monday, WHO said, the deaths are among 13 probable and two confirmed Ebola cases reported in Orientale province in eastern Congo. The Congolese Ministry of Health has set up a task force to deal with the outbreak and is working with WHO, UNICEF, Doctors Without Borders and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Twelve cases and eight deaths occurred in the area of Isiro, a town in Congo's north, WHO said. The fatalities included three health care workers. One death each occurred in Congo's Pawa and Dungu regions. Prisoner with suspected case of Ebola escapes from hospital in Uganda . Congo's Orientale province borders western Uganda, where 24 probable and confirmed cases, including 16 deaths, have been reported since the beginning of July. But WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl told CNN that there's no connection between the outbreaks in Uganda and Congo. The viruses, he said, are two different Ebola strains. There are five strains of the virus, a highly infectious and often fatal agent spread through direct contact with bodily fluids . And, Hartl said, it is extremely difficult to travel between Isiro, for example, and Kiballe, the western Ugandan district where an outbreak emerged last month. That's because it is heavily forested with impassable roads, and the only viable way to travel is going 10 to 15 kilometers per hour via motorbike. So it is unlikely there would be contact between Ugandans and Congolese that would lead to infection. Could the Ebola outbreak spread to the U.S.? The natural habitat of the Ebola virus is in the central African forest belt region, Hartl said. It's ""either by chance"" or from ""more surveying"" for the disease, he said, that ""we see these two outbreaks concurrently."" Health agencies have embarked on an aggressive approach in Uganda to deal with the cases. WHO has asked countries bordering Uganda to ""enhance surveillance"" for the virus. The last confirmed case in Uganda was admitted to an isolation facility on August 4, WHO said. The virus was first detected in 1976 in Congo, when the country was known as Zaire. Symptoms can include fever, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, a measles-like rash, red eyes and, at times, bleeding from body openings.

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney battled over Medicare and energy policy Tuesday as the November election campaign reached out to battleground states crucial to both sides' chances for victory. In an escalating struggle to seize the advantage on the contentious Medicare issue, the Romney campaign counterpunched with a new ad accusing Obama of cutting more than $700 billion from the government-run health care plan for senior citizens. Romney made the same claim at two Ohio campaign appearances, three days after his selection of House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan brought the issue to the forefront of the campaign spotlight. Ryan is best-known for a conservative budget plan passed by the U.S. House that includes reforms to partially privatize Medicare, which Democrats say will kill the popular entitlement program. To counter consistent Democratic attacks in recent days against Ryan's Medicare proposals, the new Romney ad sought to turn the tables by contending the money senior citizens have paid into Medicare for years will instead fund Obama's 2010 health care reform bill. At a campaign event Tuesday in Ohio, Romney beat the same drum. Follow along on the CNN electoral map . ""When he ran for office he said he'd protect Medicare, but did you know that he has taken $716 billion out of the Medicare trust fund -- he's raided that trust fund -- and you know what he did with it?"" Romney said of Obama. ""He's used it to pay for Obamacare -- a risky, unproven, federal government takeover of health care -- and if I'm president of the United States we're putting the $716 billion back."" A July 24 Congressional Budget Office report said that repealing the health care law, as called for by Romney and Ryan, would increase spending on Medicare by $716 billion through 2022. At the same time, the CBO letter said keeping Obamacare in place would not mean a $716 billion decrease in Medicare spending as claimed by Romney and his ad. The Obama campaign called Romney's claim ""dishonest and ""hypocritical."" ""The savings his ad attacks do not cut a single guaranteed Medicare benefit, and Mitt Romney embraced the very same savings when he promised he'd sign Paul Ryan's budget,"" said Obama campaign spokeswoman Lis Smith. David Axelrod, Obama's senior campaign adviser, told CNN earlier Tuesday that Medicare reforms in the president's health care law ""took away subsidies, unwarranted subsidies, to insurance companies, and he used that money to help lengthen the life of Medicare by nearly a decade."" Dueling appearances by the presidential contenders and their running mates hit states considered up for grabs in November -- Iowa, Ohio, Colorado, Nevada and Virginia. Standing in front of helmeted Ohio coal workers, Romney promised American energy independence by 2020 if he is elected to two terms, saying he will promote full development of the nation's oil, coal and natural gas reserves. He accused Obama of opposing coal energy production as part of a policy that favors energy sources ""that come from above the ground"" -- such as wind and solar energy -- instead of those from below the ground. Since taking office in 2009, Obama has called for a comprehensive energy strategy that includes development of cleaner alternative sources such as wind and solar energy. Republican critics contend the administration uses environmental regulations and other means to hinder development of fossil fuel energy resources such as oil and coal. Paul Ryan's Gen X sensibilities an asset? ""He also said you can go out and build a new coal plant if you want, but you'll go bankrupt. That's what he said,"" Romney told the applauding crowd. Speaking at the same time as Romney, Obama told a campaign event in Oskaloosa, Iowa, that Romney would not support the wind energy industry developing in the state. ""Gov. Romney said let's end the tax credits for wind energy production, let's get rid of them. He said that new sources of energy like wind are imaginary,"" Obama said. The president cited a thriving wind energy industry in the state, noting it supports nearly 7,000 Iowa jobs. ""If he knew what you've been doing, he'd know that about 20% of Iowa's electricity now comes from wind, powering our homes and our factories and our businesses in a way that's clean and renewable,"" Obama said, later calling for a halt to billions of dollars in tax subsidies to oil companies making ""huge profits"" and instead investing in ""the new homegrown energy that's creating jobs here in Iowa."" Overall, though, the campaign focus remained on Ryan and his budget plan passed by House Republicans that calls for sharp cuts in non-military spending to shrink government as well as stark reforms to the Medicare and Medicaid entitlement programs that provide health care to senior citizens, the poor and the disabled. Ryan's proposals include the provision that Medicare-approved private insurers would one day compete with traditional Medicare on an exchange. The intention of his plan is to remake Medicare so that it remains financially soluble for future generations, while preserving the benefits of current seniors and those who will qualify in the next 10 years, he told CBS on Sunday. Ryan, campaigning in Colorado, made no specific mention of his Medicare reform plans, instead emphasizing his ""regular guy"" interests, such as bow-hunting, and promising to restore opportunity for those willing to work for it. ""When I was growing up, you know when I was flipping burgers at McDonalds, when I was standing in front of that big Hobart machine washing dishes or waiting tables, I never thought of myself as stuck in some station in life,"" Ryan told more 2,000 supporters at Lakewood High School in suburban Denver. ""I thought to myself: I'm the American dream."" A contrast in Catholic politics . Later Tuesday, Ryan attended an event at GOP bankroller Sheldon Adelson's Las Vegas hotel. Across the country, Vice President Joe Biden held two events in Virginia, where he challenged the policies of Romney and Ryan. ""Look at what they value and look at their budget and what they are proposing,"" Biden said at his first stop, in Danville. He accused Romney of promising to lift regulations on big banks that would ""unchain Wall Street,"" adding: ""He is going to put y'all back in chains."" At an event Tuesday evening in Chillicothe, Ohio, Romney attacked Obama and his surrogates, saying they have made ""wild and reckless accusations that disgrace the office of the presidency."" He pointed to Biden's remark, calling it an outrageous charge. ""And the White House sinks a little bit lower,"" he said. ""This is what an angry and desperate presidency looks like."" An Obama campaign spokeswoman said earlier the president had no problem with Biden's statement. ""We find the Romney campaign's outrage over the vice president's comments today hypocritical, particularly in light of their own candidate's stump speech questioning the president's patriotism,"" said a statement by Stephanie Cutter of the Obama campaign. Republicans reject the Democratic tactic to tie Romney to the Ryan proposal, saying the former Massachusetts governor has his own budget and tax plans that are similar to Ryan's but also include key differences, such as protecting anyone over 55 from changes to Medicare. ""The budget plan, the approach on Medicare and all of that is going to be the Romney plan,"" senior Romney campaign adviser John Sununu told CNN Tuesday. Pressed for details in a combative interview on ""Starting Point with Soledad O'Brien,"" Sununu said Romney ""likes the Ryan plan for its guts,"" but added ""he has his own plan out there, which is carefully crafted to protect the seniors from 55 and up."" By contrast, Sununu added, the Republican plans are more comprehensive and detailed than proposals by Obama and Democrats that fail to seriously address the nation's deficit-debt problem. The focus of the debate on Ryan's budget plan and Medicare means Democrats are winning the early message war, said Erick Erickson of the conservative website RedState.com. Romney's choice of Ryan means the campaign, for now, ""is no longer a referendum on the president,"" which has been the central GOP strategy, said Erickson, a CNN contributor. ""It's a choice between two visions. And a lot of Republican strategists don't have confidence that the Romney campaign is able to sell their choice,"" Erickson said Monday night. In addition, Erickson noted, the main topic now is Medicare and ""Republicans don't necessarily win when you talk about Medicare."" Campaign 2012: How low can you go? CNN's Paul Steinhauser, Kevin Liptak, Ashley Killough, Rachel Streitfeld, Peter Hamby and Alexander Mooney, and CNNMoney's Lex Haris contributed to this report.","Romney campaigns in Ohio, calls Biden's Wall Street remark outrageous .

"(Health.com) -- When billionaire investor Warren Buffett revealed last week that he has been diagnosed with early-stage prostate cancer, the reaction -- including from Buffett himself -- amounted to a collective shrug. Buffett said his doctors told him the cancer is ""not remotely life-threatening or even debilitating in any meaningful way,"" which led some observers to wonder why the 81-year-old had bothered to get screened for the disease in the first place. Since 2008, an independent panel of experts that advises the federal government on preventive care has discouraged the use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests -- a type of blood test -- to screen for cancer in men ages 75 and up. Tumors in this population tend to be slow-growing and asymptomatic, so early detection may carry more risks than benefits, the panel concluded. Health.com: What men must know about PSA tests . Buffett's diagnosis isn't the only sign that this recommendation hasn't sunk in. According to a research letter published this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association, PSA testing rates in men over age 75 have remained steady since the panel released its guidelines in 2008. National survey data shows that 43% of men in that age bracket underwent PSA screening in 2005. In 2010, the researchers found, 44% reported having a PSA test done -- a statistically negligible difference. ""Screening patterns couldn't have been more similar before and after,"" says lead researcher Scott E. Eggener, M.D., an assistant professor of surgery at the University of Chicago Medical Center. PSA tests aren't harmful in and of themselves, but studies have shown that positive results can lead to psychological distress, unnecessary biopsies, and overtreatment. In older men, most early-stage tumors don't require treatment because the men are likely to succumb to something else before the tumor becomes dangerous. Treatments, including surgery and radiation, may be riskier than continuing to monitor a tumor, since they carry a risk of incontinence and sexual dysfunction. (Buffet, for his part, has elected to undergo radiation.) Health.com: Do you really need that medical test? So why haven't screening rates budged? The researchers can only speculate, but it could be that doctors and patients simply aren't aware of the new guidelines. Another, more troubling possibility is that some prostate cancer specialists are recommending PSA tests to collect the reimbursement fee and generate business. Eggener says neither of these scenarios is especially likely, however. The media coverage surrounding the 2008 guidelines has been hard to miss, he says, and although there may be a ""subset"" of specialists who are ""consciously or unconsciously"" overscreening and overtreating their patients, most PSA tests are ordered by primary care physicians with no financial stake in a diagnosis. What's more likely is that doctors and patients are accustomed to viewing screening as a good thing, and are unable or unwilling to let that belief go despite all the data to the contrary. ""Physicians and patients latch onto the concept of screening for cancer and catching cancers early,"" Eggener says. The ongoing discussion surrounding the appropriate amount of cancer screening extends beyond prostate cancer. The panel that issued the 2008 guidelines, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), has spurred controversy in recent years by relaxing its screening recommendations for breast and cervical cancer as well. Health.com: A guide to breast cancer screening . In 2011, the task force released draft guidelines that extended its recommendation against PSA testing to men of all ages. The current trend suggests the new guidelines may go unheeded, especially since not everyone agrees that PSA tests should be universally discouraged. Even among men in the 75-and-over bracket, Eggener says, screening might make sense for certain patients. Older men in relatively poor health probably won't benefit from early detection and treatment, he says, but that might not be true for a healthy and active 75-year-old who's likely to live long enough for a tumor to spread. ""It's very reasonable to check PSA levels, because it might save that guy's life,"" he says.

"(CNN) -- Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. is suffering from ""serious depression -- deep, deep depression,"" his longtime friend and former U.S. Rep. Patrick Kennedy told CNN Friday, a day after meeting with Jackson at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. ""Jesse is getting the help he needs, and he needs to make that his priority,"" Kennedy said about the Illinois Democrat who is undergoing inpatient treatment for bipolar depression at the famed facility. Jackson, 47, has not been on Capitol Hill since late May. In early June, his office released a statement saying that the congressman, who has served in the U.S. House since 1995, was taking a leave of absence because he was suffering from a ""medical condition."" What is bipolar II disorder? Jackson's office released a statement last month, attributed to an unidentified doctor, that said the congressman was ""receiving intensive medical treatment at a residential treatment facility for a mood disorder."" Though exhaustion was initially suspected as the cause of Jackson's treatment, his father, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, later said the issue was ""something much deeper, much broader, and it lasted much longer."" ""He is suffering from a behavioral symptom, and that is depression, which doesn't allow him to really work to his maximum capacity,"" Kennedy said. Kennedy, who himself has been treated for depression, predicted that Jackson will address his constituents within a couple of weeks ""about what his intentions are as to whether he's going to continue in public life or whether he is going to continue to focus on his long-term recovery."" Jackson's office has remained open for constituent services. Noting that mental illness tends to carry a stigma in the United States, Kennedy said he understood why Jackson had not initially addressed the matter in a public forum. ""The fact that Jesse didn't talk about this as a mental illness early on is reminiscent of most Americans' experience: if you have a mental illness, you don't talk about it."" Clinic: Jackson Jr. has bipolar depression . In addition to sharing a longtime friendship, the two Democrats both hail from high-profile families and both have suffered mental illness. Kennedy, too, underwent treatment at the Mayo Clinic. On Monday, the Rochester, Minnesota-based facility said Jackson was responding well to treatment for bipolar II disorder. The mental illness ""is a treatable condition that affects parts of the brain controlling emotion, thought and drive and is most likely caused by a complex set of genetic and environmental factors,"" the Mayo Clinic said in its statement. Jackson is the son of the famed civil rights leader and represents Illinois' 2nd Congressional District, which includes parts of Chicago. Kennedy formerly represented Rhode Island and is the son of the late Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Massachusetts. In addition to struggling openly with addiction, Kennedy has battled bipolar disorder, and has used his public persona to advocate for others with mental illness. He introduced legislation in the House that became law in 2008 forcing insurance companies to cover mental illnesses as if they would physical ailments. Pelosi: Jackson should take all the time he needs . In March, Jackson decisively won a heated primary despite being the subject of an investigation by the House Ethics Committee. The panel has been examining allegations that Jackson or one of his associates offered to raise funds for disgraced former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich in exchange for the U.S. Senate seat vacated by President Barack Obama. ""There is no doubt that the stress in his life, particularly because he's under investigation, clearly perhaps precipitated this,"" Kennedy said. ""Many of us have genetic predispositions to cancer, heart disease or, in this case, mental illness, but they often get triggered by environmental factors. In mental illness, stress is an environmental factor and clearly, I think, has been a factor in his succumbing to this outbreak of his bipolar disorder."" Blagojevich, convicted on multiple corruption charges, started serving a 14-year prison sentence in March. What do we know about mood disorders? CNN's Ashleigh Banfield, Laurie Ure and Allison Brennan contributed to this report.","Former U.S. Rep. Patrick Kennedy says Jackson ""is getting the help he needs""

"(CNN) -- I went online this morning to see the Mountain Dew ad -- the one some are calling the most racist in history -- expecting to see some really offensive stuff. Instead, I saw some really silly stuff. The goat's funny. The names of some of the black men in the lineup are hilarious. The premise: ridiculous. And I would think that's the point of a commercial with a talking goat. It's meant to be ridiculous and not taken seriously. It's comedy of the absurd, along the lines of Del Shores' ""Sordid Lives,"" Jerry Seinfeld's parents on ""Seinfeld"" or ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" Does it play on stereotypical imagery? Yes, and because of that, I can see how some could be a bit put off by a police lineup featuring all black men before a frightened white woman. But come on, one of the suspects' names is ""Beyonte."" The circumstances surrounding the scene in the commercial are so outrageously over the top, I found myself snickering more than anything. Similar to the way I snickered during a skit featuring Dave Chappelle, who was making fun of racism with the creation of his character Clayton Bigsby, a blind white supremacist in the South. And he's black. ""You've never left this property, have you, Mr. Bigsby?"" ""No, sir, not in many years."" ""What if I were to tell you that you are an African-American?"" ""Sir! Listen! I'm gonna make this clear. I am in no way, shape or form involved in any n***erdom!"" Classic Chappelle. The Mountain Dew commercials' brand of frat-boy physical humor isn't everyone's thing. It could be seen as callous or making light of battered women. For me, though, the presence of a talking goat put me in a different ""South Park""-ish mindset. There's a reason ""South Park"" remains a high-rated show, why ""The Simpsons"" is the longest-running sitcom in history, why a third installment of ""The Hangover"" is being released: A lot of people like dumb, frat-boy humor draped in fantasy. And I'm not trying to say Tyler, the Creator (whose real name is Tyler Okonma) scripted a commercial that is as brilliant as anything we've seen on the ""Chappelle Show."" And because of the rape fantasies in his music and liberal use of homophobic slurs on Twitter, I question why the advertising executives at Mountain Dew thought it was a good idea to partner with him in the first place. But with all of that being said, I doubt his intent behind the commercial was to demonize black men. And that's the difference: intent. A commercial that uses stereotypes has the potential to make any minority group featured in it uncomfortable, but is the Mountain Dew commercial really on par with, say, ""Birth of a Nation,"" a film that blatantly uses disparaging caricatures of black men to slander and promote fear? No, it isn't, so can we please step back from the ledge? In fact, I would dare say the images of black men in many of Tyler Perry's movies, which are widely supported by the black community, are far more offensive than what I saw in that commercial. Why? Because in Perry's films, the dramatization is intended to be based in reality, while a thirsty gangsta goat by the name of Felicia is not. Thus I find the controversy to be as laughable as the Rev. Jerry Falwell saying the Teletubbies were bad for children because the purple one was gay. You know, sometimes images in pop culture are obviously insensitive or offensive, such as Lil Wayne usurping the murder of Emmett Till to make a vulgar reference about sex. And sometimes it's all one giant inkblot, like a Rorschach test. No right or wrong answers, just a peek inside the skull of the people who consume pop culture. The ad was pulled. I can't help but feel it's a sad, sad day when the policing of comedy gets to the point where we can't even laugh at a talking goat. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson checked out the Mountain Dew ad everybody says is racist .

"(CNN) -- Children should not die in schools. Children should not die from eating common foods. A minuscule speck of a peanut, not even visible, should not take a young child's life in minutes. And yet this has happened in the past two years -- to 13-year-old Kaitlyn in Chicago and to 7-year-old Ammaria in Virginia. As the holidays approach and celebratory treats are brought into schools from home, we must ensure children with food allergies are safe. Congress can contribute to that by rapidly passing the School Access to Emergency Epinephrine Act. This bill would provide states with incentives to require elementary schools and secondary schools to maintain, and permit school personnel to administer, epinephrine -- a form of adrenaline that eases hives and breathing difficulties and when injected, prevents rapid death. Quite reasonably, many people are a bit suspicious of the new hypersensitivity about foods, wondering if a little hysteria surrounds the issue. Most adults -- including me -- grew up in a world where PB&J was a staple. I don't remember having a single friend whose food was restricted for fear of a reaction that could take his or her life. Unfortunately, and for reasons no one fully understands, food allergies have indeed become more common and more severe. In 2010, I was part of a group of researchers at Northwestern University of Medicine who surveyed a demographically representative sample of 40,000 U.S. families. In a peer-reviewed study published in Pediatrics in June 2011, we revealed our findings: One in 13 children in the U.S. has a food allergy, and 40% of those have had a potentially life-threatening reaction such as difficulty breathing and throat constriction. To put that in perspective, that means two children in every school classroom, or almost 6 million American kids, have a food allergy that could potentially endanger their lives. And yet food is a part of almost everything children do. In school, they eat breakfast, lunch, snacks, treats. They eat special items for birthdays, holidays, and random celebrations. Even if every mother and father tries to be especially careful about what they send to school, no one can predict when a child with a food allergy will accidentally have a reaction to something. Fortunately, a simple and affordable solution can save lives and relieve at least some of the stress and anxiety about children's well-being. In 2011, the Chicago Public Schools put into place the Illinois School Access to Emergency Epinephrine Act. All 681 Chicago public schools, collectively educating more than 400,000 children, have an epinephrine auto-injector to quickly administer the medicine needed to help save a child's life in a severe allergy attack. School nurses and staff know exactly how to respond in a food allergy emergency. Congress has an opportunity to pass a similar bill before it ends its session. Sen. Richard Durbin introduced the School Access to Epinephrine Act on November 17, 2011. It can and should be passed. Why should the nation invest in preventing allergic reactions to foods in particular? Many other equally urgent health issues -- asthma and obesity -- afflict schoolchildren. And, quite rightly, public health experts and school nurses are working on those health problems as well. But no one wants a child to die in minutes simply because she ate a cupcake at her friend's school birthday party that was supposedly nut-free -- but had been packaged or made on a counter where nuts had been used. This bill will help schools have epinephrine auto-injectors on hand and trained staff for those emergencies. That could save the lives of those two children in each American classroom who are at risk. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Ruchi Gupta.","Ruchi Gupta: Exposure to a peanut speck can kill an allergic schoolchild in minutes .

"(CNN) -- An Illinois man died from West Nile complications over the weekend as the United States battles its biggest spike in the virus since 2004. William J. Mueller was hospitalized for two weeks and died Saturday, according to the website for the village of Lombard, a Chicago suburb. Mueller, 76, was Lombard's president, a post he held for almost two decades. This year's U.S. outbreak of West Nile, which is spread through infected mosquitoes, is one of the worst since the virus was first detected in the United States in 1999, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. At least 26 deaths and 693 cases in 32 states have been reported nationwide as of Tuesday evening, the CDC said. 'I knew my husband was going to go,' West Nile widow says . A West Nile virus epidemic in Texas prompted a judge to declare a state of emergency in Dallas County, where the disease has killed at least nine people. Insecticide spraying from planes will be offered to certain communities hit hard by the virus. ""Dallas had a very mild winter, we had a lot of rain -- we were very thankful for all the rain, because we had been part of the drought last year -- (but) that combination is going to create a higher mosquito population,"" Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings told CNN. Ebonie Conner is the mother of one of the Texas victims, 14-year-old Jordan, who is now being treated for West Nile symptoms. There are no medications to treat the virus or vaccines to prevent infection. ""The symptoms play peek-a-boo with you,"" she told CNN, noting that her daughter's symptoms began with a headache. ""Jordan has never really said she had a headache, so when the mention of a headache became complaint of a headache, I was very concerned. And when the complaint included vomiting -- well, the next day we had a doctor's appointment."" They couldn't wait for the doctor's appointment. Jordan lapsed out of consciousness that night, so Conner took her daughter to the emergency room. Texas, Mississippi and Oklahoma have reported the most West Nile infections in people, birds or mosquitoes, according to the CDC, which lists a breakdown of infections by state. ""It is not clear why we are seeing more activity than in recent years,"" said Marc Fischer, a medical epidemiologist at the CDC. ""Regardless of the reasons for the increase, people should be aware of the West Nile virus activity in their area and take action to protect themselves and their family."" Rawlings is advising Dallas residents to wear long sleeves, dark clothes and an insect repellent containing DEET. West Nile virus prompts health emergency in Dallas County . ""Don't go out at dusk,"" he warned. ""That's when the most (mosquito) activity is there."" In the United States, most infections occur from June to September and peak in August, according to the CDC. Symptoms include fever, headache, body aches, joint pains, vomiting, diarrhea or rash, the CDC said. People older than 50 and those with conditions such as cancer, diabetes and kidney disease or with organ transplants are at greater risk. Those with milder illnesses typically recover on their own, but those more seriously affected may need hospital care. Health experts say prevention measures include using insect repellent and getting rid of mosquito breeding sites. West Nile virus on the rise in the U.S. Conner said she never expected West Nile to be an issue for her family. ""We were just the most unlikely people that it could happen to,"" Conner said. ""We weren't by standing water, and the kids weren't outside."" Amara Durham, a spokeswoman for Caron Texas, an alcohol and drug rehabilitation center north of Dallas, says she has a close friend who is now affected by the virus. ""I am no longer cavalier about this,"" Durham said. The center where she works is also taking precautions with its patients, she said. ""We've adjusted our schedules so that patients aren't out at dawn or dusk,"" Durham said. ""We're providing appropriate mosquito repellent. We're telling our patients what ... to wear to avoid being bitten. We're suspending activities near our lake. ""We've done a lot for preventative measures as a business within a community impacted by it."" CNN's Nick Valencia contributed to this report.","William J.

"(CNN) -- Carrying an alligator bag on an airline flight is fine, but live alligators are banned from boarding. That might explain why a toothy reptile was slithering around Chicago's O'Hare International Airport on Friday. Security guard Tineka Walker was on patrol at Terminal 3 when a passenger alerted her to the suspicious object under an escalator. ""I looked, I said, 'What?'"" Walker told CNN affiliate WBBM-TV. When Walker radioed for help, Chicago Police Officer Anthony Oliver thought at first it was a crock. ""Figured somebody was messing with us,"" Oliver told WBBM. No need to call Tarzan to wrestle the gator, which was only about 18 inches long. An airport worker used a broom and dustpan to capture it. Animal control picked it up from police and handed it over to the Chicago Herpetological Society. ""What if a little kid grabbed this, thinking it was a toy? That could do a nasty job,"" said Bob Bavirsha, a reptile rescuer with the group. Legless lizards found at the end of a runway . A major clue to how it ended up at the airport emerged on Twitter on Friday when someone posted photos of a man holding what appeared to be the same alligator. ""The patterns on an alligator are as unique as your fingerprints,"" Bavirsha said. ""We can actually match this band right here with that band right there."" The man holding the alligator in the tweeted photos also had unusual markings -- a tattoo on his arm that could help investigators identify him. The Twitter posting said the man was riding the Blue Line train, which goes to O'Hare. ""They probably realized they couldn't take it through checkpoint, and just let him go, but, oh my God!"" Walker said. The alligator will eventually find a new life in a reptile park -- after getting a few months of treatment for stunted growth, apparently from not being properly fed.

"(CNN) -- Kelly Clarkson tweeted confirmation of her weekend marriage to Brandon Blackstock on Monday, along with three photos from the wedding day. ""I'm officially Mrs. Blackstock :) We got married yesterday at Blackberry Farms in TN, the most beautiful place ever!"" Clarkson wrote. The first photograph showed the couple standing at the entrance to covered wooden bridge, with Clarkson, 31, holding a sunflower bouquet and Blackstock kissing her. Another picture shows the couple kissing in a grassy field, while the third is a closer shot of Clarkson standing alone with her bouquet. Blackberry Farm is a rural resort in the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains, about 30 miles south of Knoxville. Clarkson, the first ""American Idol"" winner, announced her engagement to Blackstock, a talent mananger and father of two, in December. The singer told People magazine in August that the couple decided to forgo a large wedding in favor of an intimate gathering. "" 'Thank you so much for understanding, but it's just going to be me and Brandon and his two kids and the minister,' "" Clarkson said she told friends and family.","Clarkson weds at a resort in the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama said Friday he came to Mexico to break down stereotypes between the United States and its neighbor to the south. Speaking at the Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City, Obama said that too often the relationship between the United States and Mexico is ""trapped in old stereotypes,"" where Mexicans see America as trying to wall itself off from Mexico and Americans see Mexico through the sensational headlines of violence in the war on drugs. ""I have come to Mexico because it is time to put old mindsets aside,"" Obama said. ""It's time to recognize new realities, including the impressive progress in today's Mexico."" He said it is clear that ""a new Mexico is emerging,"" highlighted by a growing economy, a robust democracy and new generation of youth empowered by technology. ""I see a Mexico that is taking its rightful place in the world,"" he said. In a tip of the hat to the overwhelming number of Latinos that helped re-elect Obama in 2012, the president said, ""Without the strong support of Latinos, including so many Mexican-Americans, I would not be standing before you today as president of the United States."" Throughout much of Obama's only speech in the country, the president framed two domestic issues in the United States -- guns and immigration -- as issues that affect the daily lives of Mexicans, too. On immigration, the president appeared confident that immigration reform, an issue Obama says he intends to work closely with the Mexican government on, will be passed. ""I'm optimistic that -- after years of trying -- we are finally going to get it done this year,"" Obama said after describing his plan as one that strengthens border security, improves legal immigration and ""gives millions of undocumented individuals a pathway to earn their citizenship."" And on guns, Obama framed the issue, one the president made a priority after 20 students and six adults were killed at a school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, as something that would save both American and Mexican lives. ""We also recognize that most of the guns used to commit violence here in Mexico come from the United States,"" the president said. ""I will continue to do everything in my power to pass common sense reforms that keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people, that can save lives here in Mexico and back home in the United States."" In interviews before the speech, however, most students in the crowd did not mention guns or immigration as issues they hoped the president would discuss. Flanked by American and Mexican flags, students from The American School Foundation in Mexico City put the war on drugs, North Korea and education as higher priorities for them than either immigration reform or guns. ""I hope to hear about his education plans in the U.S., because college is expensive and I'm hoping to study there,"" said Stephanie Vondell, an 18-year-old senior. Obama did mention education, telling the students that the United States and Mexico need to ""do more together in education so our young people have the knowledge and skills to succeed."" The president also announced plans to encourage 100,000 students from the United States to study in Latin America, including Mexico, each year, and for the same number of Latin American students to come to the United States. Although many of the students live in Mexico City, an area that has witnessed far fewer incidents of drug-related violence than the north, the war on drugs was not far from most students' minds. ""The biggest thing I want to see is how the U.S. and Mexico are willing to tackle the war on drugs,"" said Julio Meyer, another 18-year-old senior. ""In my point of view, it has not been successful."" On Thursday, at a news conference with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, Obama stressed the focus of his trip is the economy, not security and immigration, two issues Obama said often get too much attention when it comes to talking about the U.S.-Mexico relationship. ""We don't want to make this relationship targeted on one single issue,"" Obama said. ""We want to place particular emphasis on the potential in the economic relationship between Mexico and the United States."" But even as Obama and Pena Nieto pushed to shift the tone more toward trade and economics, security issues loomed large over Thursday's meeting. Pena Nieto said Thursday that his government remains committed to fighting organized crime, but the United States and Mexico must ""cooperate on the basis of mutual respect, to be more efficient in our security strategy that we are implementing in Mexico."" Obama stressed that the countries will continue to cooperate closely on security, but he didn't specify how. ""I agreed to continue our close cooperation on security, even as that nature of that close cooperation will evolve,"" he said. It's up to the Mexican people, Obama said, ""to determine their security structures and how it engages with other nations, including the United States."" High-profile cartel takedowns were a hallmark of former President Felipe Calderon's tenure. Pena Nieto has vowed to take a different approach, focusing more on education problems and social inequality that he says fuel drug violence. The details of his policies are still coming into focus, and analysts say his government has deliberately tried to shift drug violence out of the spotlight. Before Obama's arrival, a spate of news reports this week on both sides of the border detailed changes in how Mexico cooperates with the United States. Under the new rules, all U.S. requests for collaboration with Mexican agencies will flow through a single office, Interior Minister Miguel Angel Osorio Chong told Mexico's state-run Notimex news agency. It is a drastic change from recent years, when U.S. agents enjoyed widespread access to their Mexican counterparts. Critics have expressed concerns that Pena Nieto's government will turn a blind eye to cartels or negotiate with them -- something he repeatedly denied on the campaign trail last year. On Tuesday -- two days before Obama's arrival -- his government arrested the father-in-law of Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, head of Mexico's Sinaloa cartel and one of the country's most-wanted drug lords. But with the focus on the economy, Pena Nieto said the presidents agreed to create a new high-level group to discuss economic and trade relations between the two nations. The group, which will include Cabinet ministers from both countries and Vice President Joe Biden, will have its first meeting this fall, the Mexican president said. Imports and exports between the United States and Mexico totaled nearly $500 billion last year, and before Obama's arrival officials on both sides of the border said economic relations would be a focal point during the U.S. president's visit. Later, he traveled to Costa Rica, where he met with President Laura Chinchilla and other regional leaders. Obama pledged continued U.S. support to the Central American Regional Security Initiative, saying ""with the absence of security,"" it is very hard to develop economically. ""Problems like narco-trafficking arise when a country is vulnerable because of poverty and institutions not working for people,"" he said. ""The stronger the economy and institutions for individuals seeking legitimate careers, the less powerful these narco-trafficking operations are going to be."" CNN's Mariano Castillo and Brianna Keilar and CNN en EspaÃ±ol's Juan Carlos Lopez and Mario Gonzalez contributed to this report.","NEW: President Obama meets with Costa Rican President Laura Chinchilla, regional leaders .

"(CNN) -- I got a rather weird invitation last week. I am a Republican strategist who often takes to the CNN airwaves to criticize President Obama. When the rather official-looking e-mail arrived inviting me to share my thoughts with the president, well, let's just say it made me highly suspicious I was getting punked. But it wasn't a joke. Apparently, President Obama's charm offensive extends beyond Republicans in Congress to occasionally critical Republican pundits. Last Monday, I joined a small group of U.S. Hispanic leaders in meeting with President Obama, ahead of his trip to Mexico and Costa Rica this week. Before the meeting, several friends asked me: ""Why is Obama going to Latin America?"" It's a legitimate question. It's not often that U.S. presidents travel to Latin America without the specific purpose of participating in a summit or visiting an area ravaged by a natural disaster. But it seems that President Obama's only reason for going is to pay the region some attention, recognize the role of these countries as strategic partners of the United States and service the relationship. Good for him. Every now and then, it's wise to drop in on neighbors for a friendly visit -- just because. For decades, Latin America has been on the back burner and only became of interest when war or another crisis erupted. My friends there frequently tell me they feel neglected by ""TÃ­o Sam."" President Obama laid out a thoughtful and broad approach to the bilateral relationship with Mexico and Central America. Too often when we think of this region, we think only of problems. There are plenty of those: violence, gangs, drug trafficking, border security, corruption, political instability. But plenty of positive things can be highlighted, and it seems that is what President Obama wants to do. The trip is intended to cast a light on economic opportunities and joint interests in commerce between the United States and Latin America, and competing globally as a united block. He plans to give a forward-looking speech in Mexico, focusing on how the economies of the two countries are intertwined and how together, they can better compete in the international economy. A marker of success for this trip would be to convince Mexico that the United States considers it a full strategic partner. In Central America, the president intends to recommit to fostering improved trade with the countries of the isthmus. We have CAFTA, the Central American Free Trade Agreement, which the administration would like to see working better. Other issues, such as immigration, will always creep into a conversation about Latin America and U.S. ties. The Mexicans and Central Americans don't like it when we North Americans preach to them about their internal politics, and we wouldn't like it much more if they did the same to us. Mexico is not the place to go debate or advance U.S. immigration legislation. But it would make sense to promote the economic benefits of a modernized and streamlined immigration system that would allow the regulated flow of tourists and workers from Latin America. It's a good thing that President Obama is making this trip. Afterward, the key question becomes what the tangible followup will be. In order to develop healthy and productive ties with the region, the engagement has to be long-term and sustained. Our Cabinet secretaries and other high-level administration officials should also be deployed on a mission of strengthening relationships. I suggested to President Obama that he find a way to send U.S. Hispanic civic leaders and professionals as good will ambassadors. Also, President Obama should issue a statement on the violence and political strife going on in Venezuela since last month's election. The words of a U.S. president carry great weight. It is important for Venezuelans to know that the international community is concerned about what is happening in their country. As we left the meeting, I wished President Obama good luck on his trip and left him with one parting thought: ""Keep a close eye on the Secret Service this time...""

"(CNN) -- Five exotic animals once owned by an Ohio man who last year set free dozens of animals before committing suicide were returned to the man's widow Friday. Two spotted leopards, two macaque monkeys and a brown bear were returned to Marian Thompson, widow of farmer Terry Thompson, who set off a scare in October when he let loose 50 dangerous animals from his farm before shooting himself. Forty-eight of those animals were killed by law enforcement, and two primates were killed by the other animals, zoo officials said. The five animals returned to Marian Thompson were never released from their cages by her late husband. A sixth unreleased animal, a leopard, died in January at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium, where all of Thompson's remaining animals had been housed for safekeeping since the incident. A state review board concluded that the animals are free of ""dangerously infectious or contagious diseases."" The finding required them to lift a quarantine imposed in a move in October to delay their return. State officials said they were concerned that Marian Thompson has said she would put the five remaining animals into the same cages they previously inhabited on her Zanesville farm. They said they have no legal power to inspect the cages before the animals are returned, but they are hoping the local sheriff will seek a court order to inspect the farm ""to ensure the safety of the animals and the public,"" said Erica Pitchford, a spokeswoman for the Ohio Department of Agriculture. Thompson had not allowed local law enforcement onto the farm to check the pens, Muskingum County Sheriff Matthew Lutz said. ""We have the zoo on speed dial,"" Lutz said. ""If we are pushed to do what we had to do the last time, we would take care of it."" Legislation that would tighten rules regarding private ownership of exotic animals passed the Ohio Senate in April and is now being heard in the House of Representatives. ""Zoo officials encourage lawmakers to pass a bill quickly to ensure public safety and protect the welfare of animals,"" the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium said in a news release.","NEW: Marian Thompson gets 2 spotted leopards, 2 macaque monkeys and a brown bear .

"Washington (CNN) -- Two more Secret Service members have resigned over a Colombia prostitution scandal, the agency said Tuesday, while another member is being forced out and two more were cleared of serious misconduct. The latest resignations brought to nine the total number of members who have resigned or are being forced out because of the controversy, with three others cleared of the most serious allegations but still facing possible administrative discipline. A total of 24 people -- 12 Secret Service members and 12 U.S. military members -- were under investigation in the alleged prostitution scandal. Military officials are carrying out a separate investigation of their personnel. Meanwhile, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee said Tuesday that he wants an outside investigation to determine whether any White House staff members engaged in inappropriate behavior in Colombia. ""I'm not going to be satisfied until we get some independent look at this,"" Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa told CNN. Grassley said he wants the inspector general at the Department of Homeland Security to investigate the White House staff members' possible involvement in the controversy that has embarrassed the Secret Service and raised questions about a possible security breach before President Barack Obama's trip to Cartagena, Colombia, for the Summit of the Americans this month. Acknowledging that the inquiry would be outside the inspector general's jurisdiction and require Obama's invitation, Grassley said the president should do it to keep his promise to maintain unprecedented openness and transparency in his administration. On Monday, White House spokesman Jay Carney said White House Counsel Kathryn Ruemmler conducted an internal review over the weekend and found no wrongdoing by members of the Obama advance team in Colombia ahead of the president's trip. Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, scoffed at the idea of an outside inquiry Tuesday, saying Grassley's request was political. ""I'm a little frustrated when anybody tries to make politics out of this,"" Leahy said, repeating the words ""politics"" and ""political"" multiple times. ""The fact of the matter is, they're being totally transparent on this,"" Leahy said of the White House. Based on what he has been told in private briefings, Leahy said, he saw no evidence that Obama staffers who traveled to Colombia ahead of the president's arrival behaved inappropriately. ""There are probably some who are disappointed that the White House is not involved, but having more investigations is not going to find somebody who was involved when nobody was involved,"" Leahy said. ""Let's get this out of politics. We're talking about the president of the United States. It is a matter of security; don't play politics."" Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano will appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday at the first congressional hearing since the scandal erupted. Obama commented on the scandal in an interview Tuesday for broadcast on NBC's ""Late Night With Jimmy Fallon,"" saying ""99.9%"" of Secret Service agents do great work and put their lives on the line. ""So a couple of knuckleheads shouldn't detract from what they do, but what these guys were thinking, I don't know,"" Obama said. ""That's why they're not there anymore."" Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said Tuesday that he has ""no tolerance"" for the kind of behavior alleged in Cartagena, noting that Marines involved in an altercation with prostitutes in Brazil last year were demoted and punished. Panetta was asked about the December incident at a news conference in Brazil, according to a TV pool report. Three Marines and a State Department employee were involved in an altercation over payment with dancers and prostitutes from a Brazilian club. One woman allegedly started a fight inside a Marine's vehicle and was injured when she was kicked out of the vehicle and tried to get back in. A spokesman for the Joint Chiefs of Staff said Tuesday that officials including Vice Admiral William Gortney, the director of the Joint Staff, will brief senators on the Armed Services Committee on Thursday about the military investigation of the scandal. Grassley, meanwhile, is demanding that the White House counsel make public details of her internal inquiry in addition to an independent investigation of White House staffers. On Monday night, Grassley sent a letter to Ruemmler, asking about how the inquiry was conducted and how the conclusion was reached. Asked about Grassley's letter Tuesday, Carney said he had not seen it. In his letter, Grassley noted that he had asked Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan whether any White House advance staffers had been involved but hadn't received an answer by Monday. Grassley asked for answers to 14 questions, including details of how the White House review was conducted, whether any White House staffers had ""overnight guests"" and whether any additional room charges were incurred. Until now, the aftershocks and outrage about the Secret Service scandal were largely bipartisan. Grassley's demands and Leahy's reaction were the first major signs of a party-line division on the controversy. Senate Homeland Security Chairman Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, an independent who caucuses with Democrats but often differs with them, said he was satisfied with the White House Counsel's internal inquiry. ""I think there is so much on the line here that this is one of those cases where, if the White House counsel says nobody from the White House staff was involved in this behavior, then I'm prepared to accept that,"" Lieberman said. "" And if we find out that isn't true, then we're going to find out about it, and it's going to be a big mistake by the White House, but I have no reason to doubt what they say."" Lieberman said he intends to hold a committee hearing focusing on potential misconduct inside the Secret Service beyond what happened in Colombia. ""It's going to be what happened before: whether there was other evidence of misconduct by agents of the Secret Service,"" Lieberman said. ""Whether therefore there should have been preventative action taken by the administration of the Secret Service and, finally, what are they going to do now to make sure it doesn't happen again?"" Since the scandal broke, several whistle-blowers have called his committee with what he called ""credible"" reports of other incidents similar to Colombia, Lieberman said. He would not provide additional details. After he spoke, however, Senate Homeland Security Committee spokeswoman Leslie Phillips said Lieberman had misspoke. The committee has received a call from just one person who claimed to have information on possible misconduct, but committee staff have yet to talk to that person to determine whether that information is relevant, she said. House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa said Tuesday that his committee has heard allegations of similar misconduct by Secret Service agents dating back years. Like Lieberman, he offered no specifics. On Monday, officials said a member of the U.S. military assigned to the White House Communications Agency was under investigation in connection with alleged misconduct in Colombia, bringing to 12 the total number of military personnel being reviewed. One Defense Department official said the military member admitted to his leadership that he was involved in misconduct ""of some kind"" while in Colombia. The agency is a non-White House office that provides the president with secure communications while he travels. It is staffed by members of the military who report through the Defense Information Systems Agency. While the 11 other military members are being investigated by the U.S. Southern Command, it was unclear who would investigate the White House Communications Agency staffer, who has been relieved of his duty with the agency and reassigned to the Military District of Washington, Pentagon spokesman Capt. John Kirby said. According to sources, the alleged prostitutes -- the youngest of whom were in their early 20s -- signed in at Hotel Caribe in Cartagena, where Secret Service members apparently stayed, flashing their local ID cards. One of these women allegedly was later involved in a dispute about how much she was to be paid for the night, which brought the entire incident to light and sparked controversy in the United States and Colombia. That woman has been identified as Dania Suarez, whose neighbors described her as a 24-year-old single mother who studies English. Suarez hasn't been seen in the neighborhood since the controversy erupted, though a visitor took suitcases from the house recently, they said. While soliciting prostitution is in most cases legal for adults in Colombia, military law bars service members from patronizing prostitutes, engaging in conduct unbecoming an officer or, for enlisted personnel, conduct ""prejudicial to good order and discipline."" It is also considered a breach of the Secret Service's conduct code, government sources said. CNN's Tom Cohen and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.","Nine Secret Service agents are out or leaving over the prostitution scandal .

"(CNN) -- The deputy speaker of Britain's House of Commons, Nigel Evans, was arrested Saturday in northwest England on suspicion of rape and sexual assault, a source familiar with the arrest told CNN. Lancashire police did not confirm the identity of the man, but they said they had released a 55-year-old man on bail after questioning him Saturday over offenses alleged by two men in their 20s. One man alleged he was raped and, in a separate incident, another other man alleged he was sexually assaulted, a police spokesperson told CNN by telephone. The offenses are alleged ""to have been committed in Pendleton between July 2009 and March 2013,"" according to a statement released by police. The man was ordered to appear at the police station on June 19, according to the police spokesperson. British Prime Minister David Cameron has been made aware of the arrest, said another source, who also spoke on condition of anonymity. Evans, who is 55, has been a conservative member of parliament since 1992. He served as vice chairman of the Tory Party between 1999 and 2001. He was elected deputy speaker of the House of Commons in 2010. Evans came out as gay during a newspaper interview in late 2010, and has since made a name for himself as a prominent gay rights activist in England. Evans did not immediately return a telephone call from CNN seeking comment. CNN's Chelsea J.

A four-legged stud to give us a break from cheating golfers, dog-torturing football quarterbacks and doped-up bike racers and baseball sluggers. Kentucky Derby day is upon us again. It has been 40 years since you, Big Red -- hey, no one who knew you called you Secretariat -- took the Derby, then the Preakness, then the Belmont Stakes (by a ludicrous 31 lengths) for what we like to call horse racing's Triple Crown. Incredibly, in all three races -- I repeat, ALL THREE -- Secretariat still owns the fastest time. After he died in 1989, they discovered Big Red's heart to be more than twice the normal size. This handsome chestnut was half colt, half Ferrari ... a mean, russet running machine. Watch Secretariat's historic Belmont race . A horse is a horse? Of course, of course, yet not a one has won a Triple Crown since 1978, when Affirmed did it. And no steed in lo these 40 years has had anything close to Secretariat's popularity, pizzazz and -- OK, I gotta do it -- animal magnetism. Saturday afternoon, it's time for yet another wild mid-Eastern roundup. An equine chorus line of toddler-seeking-tiara 3-year-olds will be saddled up in Louisville for the 139th running of the Kentucky Derby, a horse race so old, the first one was run 10 years after the Kentucky-bred Abe Lincoln got assassinated. Place your bets. Verrazano? Goldencents? Orb? Oxbow? Overanalyze? Itsmyluckyday, maybe? They'll be at the post, barring late scratches, with quite a few others for the Run for the Roses, so it's definitely going to be somebody's lucky day. Is there a Secretariat in the bunch? A magnificent nag who will make tongues wag in the months ahead? A horse that can give the sport of thoroughbred racing a badly needed golden goose? A way to change the sports-fan conversation from the usual MLB, NBA, NCAA, NHL, PGA, NASCAR blah blah blah? I sure do hope so. But don't hold your breath. Bleacher Report: Kentucky Derby coverage . Consider the track record of the Kentucky Derby's past nine winners: . • I'll Have Another (2012), Hurt, scratched from Belmont, has not run another race. • Animal Kingdom (2011), Hurt after Belmont, did not run again in 2011. • Super Saver (2010), never won again, retired in October 2010. • Mine That Bird (2009), never won again, retired in November 2010. • Big Brown (2008), retired in October '08. • Street Sense (2007), retired in October '07. • Barbaro (2006), Hurt in Preakness, never ran another race. • Giacomo (2005), won one more race, retired in '06. • Smarty Jones (2004), lost in Belmont, never ran again. Kings for a day, for a fortnight, for a few weeks. Then no more. Each cashed a ticket in the I Won The Derby lottery, but that's about it. In, out. What we're looking for is a horse that can run and keep running, let us go see him do his thing. (And I don't mean pet him in a pasture after he's put out to stud.) We want a horse for the ages, a winged Pegasus to become the subject of myths. Secretariat went to the post only a few months more after donning his Triple Crown, but at least crowds did get to come out and see him race at Arlington Park, at Saratoga, at Belmont again, even in Toronto before he was free to go sire baby Secretariats. (Whoa, Big Red!) Seabiscuit didn't run in a Kentucky Derby, but he definitely had the kind of super-popularity I mean. For his match race with War Admiral in 1933, they say 40,000 came to the track while 40 million tuned in on the radio. Now there's an A-list star. We nearly had another in Smarty Jones a few years back. I was on Long Island when his run in the 2004 Belmont drew an astounding crowd of 120,139, which they say to this day is the largest crowd ever to attend a New York sporting event of any kind. Smarty was a party. He was undefeated. But he got caught from behind that day at the wire and then hung up his horseshoes for good. That swift little colt could have become 10 times the size of Taylor Swift, and I don't mean on a scale. He could have been a cover model for American Bridle, had a hundred thousand followers at any track in America and a million on Twitter. We were a little giddy over I'll Have Another a year ago, after he won the Derby and Preakness, but his humans withdrew him from the Belmont at the last minute. I'll Have Another never had another. He'd had enough. Check, please. Horse racing ain't what it used to be. So many great tracks of old, gone. Bay Meadows, Bowie, Garden State, Hialeah, Longacres, Narragansett, so many more, open no more. Attendance at our surviving tracks is way down, coast-to-coast. Lines at the $2 windows aren't usually too long. On the other hand ... ""People can now sit on their couch and watch -- and bet -- on races, eliminating the need to go to the track or even to a wagering facility,"" said Bob Mieszerski, long one of America's top turf writers and handicappers who is now director of publicity at California's Hollywood Park. ""I still believe the on-track experience is special, but in this day and age of traffic and high gas prices, I understand why people don't want to make the trek to the track."" Churchill Downs will have its usual huge throng Saturday, with TV ratings to match. So wouldn't it be swell if a superhorse could ride to racing's rescue? ""A superhorse may spark interest for awhile,"" Mieszerski respectfully disagreed, ""but I have never agreed with those who believe a Triple Crown winner is going to be some magic elixir for whatever ails racing. The Kentucky Derby is a spectacle, and a lot of people who couldn't care less about racing will show up just to say that they were there. The same goes for TV.'' Probably, Bob. I still feel a superhorse could pack 'em in at the track, from Aqueduct to Santa Anita, from Thistledown to Oaklawn, from Gulfstream to Del Mar, if we were given a chance to jump in our cars and go see the animal everybody's talking about, the Next Secretariat. Two bucks on Orb for me, please. I feel lucky.","It's been 40 years since Secretariat won the Triple Crown .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- The 40th anniversary of the normalization of relations between China and Japan will be marked on September 29 but there seems little to celebrate. The territorial dispute between Japan and China over the rocky outcrops, known as the Senkakus in Japan and Diaoyu in China, has escalated beyond expectations as both governments have upped the ante and domestic politics constrains room for maneuver. As bad as it seems now, it was also quite perilous in 2010 after a Japanese Coast Guard arrested the crew of a fishing trawler that rammed them in the waters near the disputed rocks. This arrest sparked widespread angry protests and attacks on Japanese businesses in China. Fresh anti-Japanese protests in China on symbolic anniversary . After Beijing withheld exports of rare earth metals vital to Japanese industry, Tokyo capitulated by releasing the crew and captain. This incident inflamed lingering resentments and stoked mutual suspicions. In this most recent standoff, the saber-rattling has grown more ominous against the backdrop of a political transition in Beijing and leadership elections in Japan's two main parties. In this context, it is difficult for either side to dial down the rhetoric. Contenders for party presidency in Japan are all taking a hardline, one that will fuel more tensions. Background: How remote rock split China, Japan . Meanwhile, Beijing is getting ready to pass the baton of leadership at a time when the economy is slowing and there is growing discontent with corruption, nepotism and income disparities. Pundits expect Beijing to clamp down on the demonstrations before they morph into anti-government protests. The temptation of patriotic blustering is hard for either side to resist, but in this dangerous game of brinksmanship both countries have a lot to lose. There is a serious risk of miscalculation on both sides that could cause this scrap to spiral out of control. It doesn't take much to make a martyr and once there is blood in the water, stability in Asia is at risk. There is little to be gained from aggravating a dispute that has now assumed symbolic importance as a test of wills. Asia's disputed islands -- who claims what? Tokyo-Beijing relations are fragile and in this case the volatile combination of territorial disputes, competition for seabed resources, strategic ambitions, nationalism and unresolved historical grievances have elevated these remote outcrops into the focal point for longstanding grievances in China and growing anxieties in Japan. The rapid rise of China has lead to a tectonic shift in East Asian geopolitics and the decline of Japanese influence. This abrupt and far-reaching shift in the balance of power is destabilizing because it challenges the status quo. Complicating this transition is the acrimony caused by former prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's (2001-06) six trips to Yasukuni Shrine, seen as a talismanic ground zero for an unrepentant view of Japan's rampage in Asia between 1931-45. The rising tide of Chinese nationalism finds a familiar and handy target in Japan. At the same time, Japanese conservatives do their nation no favors by repeated provocations with their Asian neighbors. Governor Shintaro Ishihara of Tokyo deserves most of the blame for the current fracas. In April he announced plans to purchase three of the disputed islands from their private owner in Japan and raised over $15 million from public donations to do so. Beijing has been fuming ever since. An issue that had been simmering on the back burner since late 2010 is now boiling over and causing great damage to Japan's considerable interests in China. This is Ishihara's own goal, driven by an ideological agenda and contempt, that is not in line with public attitudes. He also succeeded in forcing the central government to buy the islands, as the Noda government decided that it had to marginalize Ishihara in order to manage the situation and prevent him from doing further damage. But in doing so, Tokyo triggered the current altercation. Ishihara may also be chortling because he has managed to shift Japanese politics to the right, as political contenders try to out do each other in hardline statements. He may be hoping to ratchet up nationalism in Japan because he believes the nation suffers from a patriotic deficit. The absence of anti-Chinese demonstrations in Japan suggest that he has not succeeded in this, but he has certainly inflicted great damage on bilateral relations and the scars will persist for some time. The media frenzy is whipping up negative mutual perceptions and a new generation in both countries is learning to hate and vilify. Can the ""hot"" economic relationship remain insulated from political upheaval? This is the billion-dollar question leaders should be asking because Japan is a leading investor and source of technology while China is its largest trading partner. The rocks in question are not worth all the damage they are causing, but that is precisely the point. This issue has become dangerously politicized where cost-benefit analysis, or resort to legal arguments, appear unpromising. Can calmer heads prevail? Probably. Both sides appear to be carefully edging away from the abyss, but a disastrous turn of events and violent clashes remain ominously possible. There has to be a cooling off period, but the political transition might be an opportunity to hit the reset button. To move forward Beijing and Tokyo should commit to talks about the disputed territories without preconditions, agree to refrain from violence in pursuit of rival claims and move towards confidence building measures (CBMs) that sidestep the issue of sovereignty. The most ambitious of these CBMs would be joint development of East China Sea seabed resources as specified in a 2008 accord. In 1978, Deng Xiaoping suggested that this dispute be put aside, placing faith in the wisdom of future generations to resolve this discord. Hopefully leaders on both sides will find that wisdom and act on it to avert catastrophe. In the meantime, confidence-destroying measures are digging a deeper hole to climb out of.

"(CNN) -- It's the sixth of October, 2005, a crisp Indian summer day in Manhattan, and we're sitting in the dining room of our Upper East Side apartment. Outside the window, against the cobalt blue sky, looms the Church of the Heavenly Rest, where Andrew and I were married, where my brother, tall and handsome in his morning suit, walked me up the aisle and, in my father's stead, gave me away. Now, almost forty years later, he's come alone for a single night, bringing with him a whiff of unease, even alarm. First it was his wife's last-minute cancellation, and now it's the formality with which he's summoned us to the table...like one of those scenes from Law & Order, when the detectives have to tell the family a loved one is dead. Named John Cheves Haskell Jr., after our father, he's always been known in the family as Chevey (pronounced ""Chivvy"" as in ""chin""). In addition to being the only immediate family we have (Andrew and I had no children, and Andrew's brother died in a sky-diving accident when he was twenty-eight), Chevey is the one we turn to for help in so many waysâ€”all those areas in which we are inept. From the humbly domestic (What temperature should the refrigerator be? Chevey travels with a special thermometer) to the technological to the arcane ways of money and finance (he's a financial adviser by profession and a rationalist by avocation), my brother is a fixer of problems and a fount of common sense, generous with his time as if there were no end to it. In recent years, the only time I can remember being vexed with him was in this very dining room. Andrew and I were giving a party that required removing a leaf of the chrome and glass table. As Chevey and Eleanor were up visiting, he offered to help remove the panel, but the heavy glass, detached from its chrome frame, dropped and shattered. If Andrew had perpetrated this domestic calamity, it would have been exasperating but unsurprising. At the hands of my hyper-competent brother, it was almost comically out of character. And now he is about to shatter normalcy in our dining room again, in a way that I would have said was out of character if I knew what character was and if character had anything to do with it. I'm terrified it's some fatal illness, possibly ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease), the degenerative neurological disorder from which our father died. Without our ever talking about it, that possibility has been a constant in our lives. Sensing this, he immediately disposes of it: he's not dying and he doesn't have an illness in the ordinary sense. ""I have what's known as gender dysphoria,"" he says. ""For most of my life, I've felt I should have been born female. And now I'm going to become one."" Stunned silence. Disbelief. How can this be? Chevey, my brother! Andrew's brother-in-law! He's so utterly normal. There's no sudden memory, no flash, no ""Of course."" He was (and is) a manly guyâ€”no trace of effeminacy or kid in a tutuâ€”who, if not captain of the football team or a hell-raising, beer-swilling male chauvinist, was always plenty virile, and there were two wives who'd have so attested. When did he know? ""Since way back, early childhood,"" he tells me, ""I had confusing urges, feminine longings, but even in puberty I simply had no concept for what I was experiencing."" ""You mean, as the expression has it, a female trapped in a male body?"" ""Nothing as clear as that, but just confused feelings, a desire to dress and feel like a girl, not very strong at first."" A desire, it seems, for which neither he nor society had words. His marriages were good, even sexually, but part of everyday was increasingly spent in something like agony, imagining himself a woman. I'm suddenly struck by two odd memories. In the later years of his second marriage, he became anorexic. Eleanor and I kept asking, even nagging, him about it, but he insisted he was doing it to keep his cholesterol down, with his internist's approval. ""I was trying to change my body shape,"" he now admits. The other image seems even more telling. For as long as I can remember, he would pick at the skin at his fingertips, almost like an animal gnawing its own flesh, till his fingers became raw. ""I was trying to get out of my skin,"" he says. And now, in effect, he will. I think about Eleanor. She has to be devastated. They've had what to all appearances is a wonderful marriage, worked and travelled and built a life together that is about to splinter at the seams. They're separating, he tells me, and eventually he will move to a mountain condo the two of them bought some years ago. When I ask how she's dealing with it, Chevey's calm voice wavers. ""She's having a hard time. I think she's struggling less with the idea of me being transsexual than with losing the marriage. A year and a half before we got married, I told her I had had this problem but I thought I had it under control."" ""Why now, at this late date?"" ""Because,"" he explains, ""the urge gets stronger, not weaker. You just don't want to go to your grave in what you believe is the wrong body."" I ask him if he ever thought of doing it earlier, if it was the reason he and Beth, his first wife, got divorced. He separated from Beth in 1976. We were all mystified, so joined at the hip were the two. They'd been together since puberty, had dated other people but always come back together. ""Yes, I took hormones,"" he says. ""I was going to change."" He bought a charming Tudor house in Richmond's West End and had it rezoned so that it could serve as a financial management consultancy below and residence above. And then he realized he couldn't do it. Pete, his son with Beth, was still alive, Mother was alive, the doctors he went to presented a confusing picture; there was no Internet, no information, no guidance. ""I didn't anticipate the intensity of the drive. Nobody can imagine it. To the point that not having the sex change is no longer an option. From the outside it looks like a selfish act, but from the inside not at all. I had a 'happy' life before, and I'm destroying it all. It's nothing to do with happiness. I had happiness in all those normal senses. ""It's like..."" He pauses. ""Well, imagine you're a paraplegic, and they tell you they can give you movement in your legs, but you'll have to use a cane. Of course you'd jump at the opportunity. I'll go further,"" he continues. ""I'd rather die in surgery trying to become a woman than live the rest of my life fighting it. The only way I wouldn't go through with the surgery is if there were a 100 percent chance of death."" Spoken in his calm, determined voice, rational to the end, this is so chilling it takes my breath away.","Molly Haskell's brother John revealed he was transgender at age 59 .

"Portsmouth, New Hampshire (CNN) -- At 3:30 a.m., Stefany Shaheen awoke to a feeling of uneasiness. Something was not quite right with her daughter, Elle. Creeping into her bedroom, Shaheen removed a lancet from its wrapper and poked her diabetic daughter's finger. Putting the blood onto the testing strip, she saw the results: dangerously low blood sugar. Shaheen woke Elle up and gave her orange juice to keep her from slipping into unconsciousness. Shaheen was relieved her motherly intuition had told her something was wrong with Elle that night, but she wished she didn't have to rely on it. She yearned for an automatic way of knowing when Elle was dipping into a dangerously high or low blood sugar -- and not just at night, but at school, where the 12-year-old is largely responsible for monitoring her own blood sugar. Then last week, Shaheen got her wish. Elle was selected to try out an experimental device called an artificial or ""bionic"" pancreas. During the three-day study, Elle didn't have to poke her finger every few hours to find out her blood sugar level because the ""bionic"" pancreas recorded it automatically and adjusted her insulin accordingly. Shaheen didn't have to set her alarm to wake up every three hours at night because the device was designed to catch a dangerously high or low blood sugar and treat it. ""For the first time since she was diagnosed, I didn't have to worry,"" says Shaheen, who lives in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Medical device companies are racing to be the first to market an artificial pancreas, which takes over the work of the diabetic's malfunctioning organ. The device could potentially be used for Type 1 diabetics or Type 2 diabetics who use insulin. ""It's transformative technology,"" says Aaron Kowalski, assistant vice president for treatment therapies research at JDRF, a research foundation for juvenile diabetes. JDRF is funding artificial pancreas trials at 13 sites worldwide, including Yale University, Stanford University, the University of Virginia and the University of Colorado. Device companies also are funding several other studies. ""It's looking incredibly promising,"" Kowalski says. ""I hope very much we'll have a system on the market within four years, and I'll be very disappointed if we don't."" 'Pale and pasty ... and all by herself' It was Elle who urged her mother to enroll her in an artificial pancreas study. The Shaheens first heard about the artificial pancreas shortly after Elle was diagnosed with diabetes at age 8, but she had to be 12 years old to enroll. So the day she turned 12 this past September, she started bugging her parents. ""She was constantly reminding me, 'Mom, you need to call, you need to call,'"" Shaheen remembers. Her mother was only too happy to comply. There had been several middle-of-the-night close calls, plus some desperate situations at school where the staff nurse was responsible for 450 children and ""ill-equipped,"" Shaheen says, to handle the needs of a diabetic child. ""I got a call from Elle one morning. She was in the school office and her voice was trembling, and she said 'Mom, I need you to come quick. I don't know what's wrong,'"" Shaheen says. ""I got there and her blood sugar was dropping like a rock. She was pale and pasty and sweating profusely and all by herself."" A glimpse of the dream . In January, Elle walked into Massachusetts General Hospital to start the trial. Doctors fitted her for an artificial pancreas. In the future, the device will be the size of a cell phone, but for now Elle is hooked up to a laptop. For three days, the device did the work Elle's pancreas can no longer do. ""It went very smoothly -- her blood sugar control was really very, very good,"" said Dr. Steven Russell, an instructor at Harvard Medical School. ""We were really very pleased by what we saw with Elle."" Russell's research partner, Edward Diamano, an associate professor of biomedical engineering at Boston University, says the device learned Elle's blood sugar patterns and made changes accordingly. ""It's making adjustments every five minutes,"" he says. For that one weekend, Elle didn't have to draw blood, and she could eat foods she hadn't eaten in large quantities for four years. ""She ate Spaghetti-O's and grilled cheese and french fries and hamburgers,"" Shaheen says. ""She ate between 67 and 100 grams of carbs [every meal], and usually she can only eat between 40 and 50."" Then, after the experiment, Elle had to leave the artificial pancreas behind, and it was back to counting carbs and poking herself every couple of hours. Her mother reset the nighttime alarm clock. ""We're extraordinarily impatient for access to the device,"" Shaheen says. ""I think it will revolutionize the way she lives."" ""That was really hard,"" Elle says. ""I just hope one day I can use it at home."" Baby steps . Last week, Russell and Damiano visited the Food and Drug Administration offices in Silver Spring, Maryland, to show regulators a prototype for the artificial pancreas. The device itself can be worn in a pocket or clipped to a belt. Two tiny pieces go under the skin, one to detect glucose levels in the blood and another to deliver insulin and glucagon, a drug used to raise very low blood sugar. Algorithms determine how much insulin and Glucagon the patient needs, and if necessary the patient can manually override the device. So far, the FDA has required doctors to keep patients inside the hospital while their using the device. The potential benefits are enormous, Dr. Charles Zimliki, who chairs the FDA's Artificial Pancreas Critical Path Initiative, testified before a Senate committee last year. But ""if not properly designed, use of an artificial pancreas device in an outpatient setting can place patients at significant risk."" Russell said he hopes that by the fall, the FDA will give him permission to allow adult diabetic patients to leave the building and walk the grounds of the Massachusetts General Hospital campus accompanied by a nurse, eating as they like and using the hospital's gym. Then by the summer of 2013, he hopes to give the artificial pancreas to children attending a summer camp. ""These are all baby steps towards what we ultimately want to do, which is give them the device and say, 'Go home and check back with us in a week,'"" Russell says. Shaheen is closely watching the proceedings at the FDA, with the help of her mother, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-New Hampshire, who co-chairs the Senate Diabetes Caucus. ""We're extraordinarily impatient for access to the device,"" she says. ""I think it will revolutionize the way she lives.""","Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation funding 13 artificial pancreas trials .

"(CNN) -- A Texas group run by a self-described anarchist has posted what appears to be the first video of the live firing of a handgun created with a 3-D printer. The 53-second video shows a single shot being fired from The Liberator, a plastic handgun that, with the exception of its metal firing pin, was assembled from parts made with a 3-D printer, according to Defense Distributed. The gun appears unscathed after the test firing, although the brief clip does not reveal anything about its range or accuracy. The nonprofit group, founded by 25-year-old law student Cody Wilson, has posted instructions for the gun online so other people can duplicate it. The gun was created with a Stratasys Dimension SST printer, which can be purchased online for as little as $8,000. Wilson fired the gun Saturday and the video was posted to YouTube on Sunday. The group's self-described ""Wiki Weapon Project"" is about a year old. Until now, the group had only reported being able to make plastic, interchangeable parts for firearms, but not entire weapons. The Liberator is comprised of 16 interchangeable pieces, with a nail for a firing pin. According to the group, the barrel can be changed out to fire different kinds of ammo. Not surprisingly, reports of the test-firing have reignited calls to ban 3-D-printed guns, which critics fear could easily fall into the wrong hands and create safety concerns because they'd be invisible to metal detectors. New York Sen. Charles Schumer is one of several politicians pushing for stricter legislation that would ban firearms created with 3-D printers. ""Passing this law would not only prevent people from making these parts, it would raise awareness on the issue,"" Schumer said Sunday during a news conference. ""We're facing a situation where anyone -- a felon, a terrorist -- can open a gun factory in their garage."" Schumer is joined by U.S. congressman Steve Israel of New York, who has introduced legislation to renew a ban on plastic guns that is set to expire later this year. ""I don't want to make it easier for criminals and terrorists to bring plastic guns through metal detectors and onto airplanes,"" he told CNN's Jake Tapper on Monday. It's an argument unlikely to sway Wilson, who has made no secret of his disdain for the U.S. government in particular and all governments in general. (Defense Distributed makes and sells components with names like ""The Cuomo"" and ""The Pelosi,"" to tweak politicians who support gun control). ""For me, it's important as a symbolic political statement,"" he told CNN Monday. ""And that statement is something like, 'No, the future we imagine is one of personalized manufacture and access to objects. It doesn't matter what the decision is on the Hill ... in this future, people will be able to make guns for themselves.' ""That was already true, but now it's been demonstrated in yet another technology."" Despite that worldview, Defense Distributed applied for, and in March received, a federal firearm license which makes it a legal gun manufacturer. Wilson acknowledged in a recent interview with Forbes that his creation could be used by criminals, but suggested that demonstrating the freedom to create them is more important than trying to stop that from happening. ""I recognize that this tool might be used to harm people. That's what it is: It's a gun,"" he said. ""But I don't think that's a reason to not put it out there. I think that liberty in the end is a better interest."" Defense Distributed is based near Austin, Texas. Wilson has emerged as the face of the group, although many of its members, including the owners of the 3-D printer the group uses, have chosen to remain anonymous. The group's future plans include expanding the range of ammunition a 3-D printed gun can fire and making the guns printable with less expensive printers, such as the $2,800 Replicator 2 by Makerbot.","Group showcases test firing of a gun made with a 3-D printer .

"(CNN) -- The case of a U.S. citizen sentenced to 15 years in a North Korean labor camp is not a ""political bargaining chip,"" the North's state-run Korean Central News Agency reported Sunday. Pae Jun Ho, known as Kenneth Bae by U.S. authorities, was arrested and prosecuted for various crimes aimed at ""state subversion,"" KCNA said. It previously reported the Korean-American was arrested November 3 after arriving as a tourist in Rason City, a port in the northeastern corner of North Korea. In prior instances, North Korea has released Americans in its custody after a visit by some U.S. dignitary. But Bae's case could get caught up in the recent tensions between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, as the North is formally known, and the United States. ""Whenever Americans were put under custody in the DPRK for violating the country's law, former or incumbent high-ranking American officials flew to Pyongyang and apologized for their crimes and promised to prevent the recurrence of similar incidents. Therefore, the DPRK showed generosity and set them free from the humanitarian point of view,"" KCNA reported, citing a foreign ministry spokesman. ""Pae's case proves that as long as the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK remains unchanged, humanitarian generosity will be of no use in ending Americans' illegal acts."" According to the report, Bae entered North Korea ""with a disguised identity."" He reportedly ""confessed and admitted his crimes."" ""Some media of the U.S. said that the DPRK tried to use Pae's case as a political bargaining chip. This is ridiculous and wrong guess. ""The DPRK has no plan to invite anyone of the U.S. as regards Pae's issue,"" read the KCNA report. Last week, the United States demanded Bae's immediate release. ""You all are aware of the history and how this has happened in the past with U.S. citizens,"" State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell told reporters in Washington. ""But what we're calling for and we're urging the DPRK authorities to do is to grant him amnesty and to allow for his immediate release, full stop."" Ventrell said the State Department was still trying to confirm details of the case through Swedish diplomats who visited Bae last week. Sweden represents U.S. interests in North Korea because Washington has no diplomatic relations with Pyongyang. U.S. officials have struggled to establish how exactly Bae ran afoul of North Korean authorities.

"(CNN) -- The United States has created a ""zone of impunity"" by rarely investigating private contractors involved in the unlawful killing of civilians in Afghanistan and Iraq, a U.N. human rights envoy said. Civil rights activists protest the use of unmanned U.S. drones in Pakistan. The U.S. government should track the number of civilians killed in its military operations abroad and limit collateral damage from unmanned drone attacks, Special Investigator Philip Alston said in a stinging report submitted Wednesday to the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland. ""The government has failed to effectively investigate and punish lower-ranking soldiers for such deaths, and has not held senior officers responsible,"" Alston said. ""Worse, it has effectively created a zone of impunity for private contractors and civilian intelligence agents by only rarely investigating and prosecuting them."" Alston recommended that the United States establish a national commission to independently look into the policies and practices that are leading to the deaths. He also urged that an independent special prosecutor be charged with pursuing criminal allegations against government officials accused of wrongdoing. ""First, the government has failed to track and make public the number of civilian casualties, or the conditions under which deaths occurred,"" he said. ""Second, the military justice system fails to provide ordinary people, including U.S. citizens and families of Iraqi and Afghan victims, basic information on the status of investigations into civilian casualties or prosecutions resulting therefrom."" Alston called the United States' reliance on pilotless missile-carrying aircraft ""increasingly common"" and ""deeply troubling."" U.S. forces operating in Afghanistan have used drones to attack militant targets in Pakistan. Pakistan has said the attacks have claimed hundreds of civilian lives. Mark Cassayre, the American representative to the U.N. Human Rights Council, said U.S. military and intelligence operations during armed conflict did not fall within the special investigator's mandate. Alston is the special investigator on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions. ""We wish to be clear that the prosecution of private contractors who commit crimes is an important priority of the Department of Justice, and despite the difficulty of these cases, the United States continues to attempt to bring private contractor cases to justice,"" Cassayre said.","U.N. envoy rips U.S. over investigation into drone attacks overseas .

"(CNN) -- Faster than a speeding bullet, Warner Bros.' $225 million franchise reboot Man of Steel has become a box office behemoth. The superhero film began its run with a massive $125.1 million ($113.1 million over the traditional weekend, $12 million from corporate screening programs on Thursday), breaking the record for the biggest June opening weekend ever, ahead of Toy Story 3's $110.3 million bow in 2010. Among 2013 films, Man of Steel had the second best debut of the year behind Iron Man 3, which started with $174.1 million in May. Man of Steel garnered a fantastic $29,731 per theater average from its 4,207 locations. The film grossed $13.3 million in IMAX theaters, and 41% of its business came from 3D ticket sales. Audiences were 56 percent male and 44 percent female, a more even gender distribution than Iron Man 3, which had a 61/39 percent male/female split on opening weekend. The dashing looks of Henry Cavill (and Amy Adams' appeal) no doubt helped Man of Steel play well with women. Reviews were mixed, but crowds issued the film a strong ""A-"" CinemaScore. For Cavill, Adams, and the rest of the cast — which includes Russell Crowe, Diane Lane, Kevin Costner, Laurence Fishburne, and Michael Shannon — Man of Steel became their best ever opening weekend. The same goes for director Zack Snyder, who formerly saw gigantic numbers when 300 bowed with $70.9 million in 2007. What 'Man of Steel' gets wrong about Superman . Man of Steel also clobbered the debut of 2006′s Superman Returns, which opened with $52.5 million and earned $200 million domestically against a $270 million budget. Widely considered a box office misfire, Superman Returns did not, in fact, return. In about one week, Man of Steel will likely have surpassed that film's domestic total. The news couldn't be better for Warner Bros., which — with the exceptions of The Great Gatsby and 42 — has badly struggled at the box office in 2013. Films like Jack the Giant Slayer, The Hangover Part III, Beautiful Creatures, Bullet to the Head, and The Incredible Burt Wonderstone have massively under-performed at the box office, so Man of Steel's success is a welcome change. ""We're thrilled,"" says Dan Fellman, the studio's president of domestic distribution, ""and it will fly through the summer. We're going to have legs on this film."" Fellman also notes that Man of Steel's success brings Warner Bros. and DC Comics one step closer to creating a Justice League franchise that might rival Marvel/Disney's Avengers. The exec wouldn't confirm whether Henry Cavill has already been contracted to star in Justice League films, though he did coyly remark, ""Henry will be around for a while."" Watch Henry Cavill train shirtless of 'Man of Steel' Internationally, Man of Steel soared with $71.6 million in its first weekend, including $17.6 million in the United Kingdom and $9.8 million in Mexico. The film has yet to open in a number of large markets, but it's already clear that it will easily outdo Superman Returns $191 million international haul. In second place, This is the End opened with $20.5 million, giving the raunchy R-rated comedy $32.8 million total since its Wednesday debut. While that's not a huge start, Sony spent only $32 million on the comedy, which stars Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson, Jay Baruchel, James Franco, and Danny McBride. This is the End started in the same range as Franco and Rogen's hit Pineapple Express, which opened with $23.3 million in 2008. Thanks to great reviews and strong word-of-mouth (the film earned a fair ""B+"" CinemaScore, but the polling service rarely favors edgy content), This is the End may find legs at the box office and could become a $100 million hit. Audiences were 60 percent male and 48 percent below the age of 25 — and considering Man of Steel provided direct competition for male viewers, This is the End's healthy start is commendable. Now You See Me managed to hold strong in third place with $10.3 million, marking a drop of only 46 percent. Summit's $75 million magician caper has now earned $80 million after three weekends, and if it can manage a few more slim holds, it could wind up passing $100 million. Fourth place belonged to Fast & Furious 6, which fell 52 percent to $9.4 million in its fourth weekend. The $160 million Universal release has now earned $219.6 million total, surpassing Fast Five's $209.8 million cume and making it the highest grossing Fast film domestically. Worldwide, the same is true: Fast & Furious 6's $636.9 million haul is a franchise best. Last weekend's champion, The Purge, plummeted 76 percent to $8.2 million in its sophomore frame. The thriller, which earned a weak ""C"" CinemaScore has now earned $51.8 million and may have to settle for a finish in the $60-65 million range — a very low number considering The Purge opened with $34.1 million. Universal isn't worried, though. The Purge cost only $3 million to produce. 1. Man of Steel -- $113.1 million . 2. This is the End -- $20.5 million . 3. Now You See Me -- $10.3 million . 4.

"Athens (CNN) -- The leader of Greece's extreme-right Golden Dawn party, Nikos Michaloliakos, is being held in custody after appearing in court Wednesday, the state-run Athens News Agency reported. Michaloliakos is being held at Athens Police headquarters until it's decided which jail will house him, the agency reported. He gave a deposition to a Greek court on Wednesday that lasted until the early hours of Thursday morning in Athens, it said. He faces charges of running a criminal organization following the slaying of an anti-fascist musician last month. There was a heavy police presence outside the court in Athens ahead of Michaloliakos' appearance. Three other Golden Dawn lawmakers who have already appeared in court -- Elias Kassidiaris, Elias Panagiotaros and Nikos Mihos -- were released Wednesday pending trial. A fourth, Ioannis Lagos, remains in custody. The arrests of the lawmakers, along with those of a number of party supporters, were part of a weekend police crackdown that followed a controversial stabbing death. It is the first time since the restoration of democracy in 1974, after a seven-year junta, that a party leader and members of Parliament have been arrested. Pavlos Fyssas, a popular anti-fascist figure and well-known hip-hop artist with the stage name Killah P, was the victim of a knife attack that was allegedly committed by a Golden Dawn supporter. Kassidiaris denied his party's involvement in Fyssas' death, calling it a ""heinous crime."" The singer's death has nevertheless led to renewed calls to ban Golden Dawn, which holds 18 of Parliament's 300 seats. The Greek constitution does not allow for political parties to be banned, however, and the arrested lawmakers will retain their parliamentary seats unless they are convicted of a crime. In 2012, Golden Dawn rode a wave of dissatisfaction among some Greeks -- spurred by internationally imposed austerity measures amid the country's deep financial crisis -- to win 7% of the vote and gain seats in Parliament for the first time. The ultranationalist, anti-immigration party has been linked by critics to street violence and neo-Nazism. CNN's Christine Theodorou contributed to this report.","NEW: Police hold Nikos Michaloliakos after court appearance .

"Rome, Italy (CNN) -- It doesn't take a social anthropologist to see that Italians truly love a lot about American culture. It is evident everywhere, from the popularity of Coca-Cola and Levi's to the prevalence of American music and movies. But for all they like about American culture, it's fair to say Italians are getting a little weary of the American attitude -- especially when it comes to justice. Italians point to a number of high-profile cases over the years in which they say American suspects have been accused of wrongdoing and criminal acts, but have been let off lightly. These cases leave Italians with the feeling that it's possible for Americans to get away with murder. In 1998, a U.S. Marine Corps jet on a low-level training flight sliced through steel wires supporting a cable car near the ski resort of Cavalese in the Italian Alps, sending a gondola plunging to the ground. All 20 people inside the gondola were killed. Italian prosecutors wanted the crew of the jet tried in Italy, but an Italian court ruled they should face court-martials in the U.S., in accordance with NATO treaties. The aircraft's pilot and navigator were found not guilty of involuntary manslaughter, even though the military admitted the plane had been flying lower and faster than authorized. The defense argued that the incident was a tragic accident caused partly by the fact that the plane's altimeter was not working and the gondola cable that the plane hit was not on the map that he was given. When it emerged a video that captured the accident from inside the plane had been destroyed, they were dismissed from the Marine Corps. Italians were outraged, referring to the incident as the ""massacre of Cermis."" For years, many from the local resort area held anti-American protests on the anniversary of the accident. In another incident that raised tensions, Egyptian cleric Abu Omar was seized off the streets of Milan in 2003, and smuggled to Egypt, where he says he was tortured and released four years later. Although Italy did not request the extradition of any of the suspects, 22 CIA agents were convicted in absentia of the kidnapping and sentenced to prison time for their role in the abduction, but none ever served time in Italy. They were also ordered to pay $1.5 million to Omar's family, who have received nothing so far. Italians were outraged that Americans could conduct military-style operations on Italian soil, especially involving kidnapping and torture, and go unpunished. Other cases involving the two nations have been equally controversial. In 2009, American troops opened fire at a Baghdad airport checkpoint, killing Italian secret service agent Nicola Calipari and wounding a just-freed Italian hostage, journalist Giuliana Sgrena, whom Calipari was trying to spirit out of the country. An Italian judge acquitted a U.S. soldier accused of killing Calipari, saying Italy had no jurisdiction in the case, and Italy did not request extradition. But the case is still a sensitive topic in Italy, where Calipari is considered to be a national hero killed by trigger-happy Americans. The trial of Seattle student Amanda Knox, accused of killing her British roommate Meredith Kercher in November 2007 when the two shared a house in Perugia, Italy, is also controversial. Timeline: Kercher murder case . Knox and her erstwhile lover Raffaele Sollecito were famously convicted of Kercher's murder and sentenced to 26 and 25 years respectively in 2009. That conviction was sensationally overturned in 2011 and Knox went back to Seattle. The acquittal was then overturned by Italy's high court in March 2013, meaning Knox currently stands convicted of Kercher's murder and her appeal will likely be heard early next year. Suspects are not required to attend court hearings in Italy, so Knox does not need to return to stand trial, at least in the short term. But if her original conviction is upheld on appeal and confirmed by Italy's high court, she would almost certainly face extradition orders to return to Italy to serve time for Kercher's murder. It could be years before a final decision is reached in the Knox case, and undoubtedly Knox's legal team would fight extradition on every level if her conviction is upheld. In the meantime, Italians assume Knox will never set foot in Italy again, whether she is ultimately found responsible of Kercher's murder or not. ""She will never come back here, whether she should legally or not,"" the Kercher family lawyer Francesco Maresca told CNN. ""There are too many case precedents that clearly show America does not easily surrender its criminals."" READ MORE: Amanda Knox: I wanted to come back from Italy stronger and surer of myself .

"(CNN) -- American authorities have concluded that a widely seen video does show the U.S. civilian-operated cargo jet that crashed in Afghanistan last week, a U.S. government official said Monday. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is being handled by Afghan authorities, did not give details on how U.S. authorities came to that conclusion. The National Airlines jet crashed shortly after takeoff from Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, killing all seven people aboard, officials said. National Airlines specializes in moving freight for the military and businesses. After the crash, the video of a plane crash surfaced, apparently captured by a dashboard camera inside a vehicle on the base. The approximately three-minute video shows what appears to be the National Airlines jet as it started its climb around 11:20 a.m. April 29. About 12 seconds into the video, the Boeing 747-400 appears to stall, rolls from side to side, and drops. At 23 seconds, the plane crashes nose first into the ground off the side of the road, erupting into a ball of orange flame and black smoke. National Air Cargo, the parent of National Airlines, said the flight had refueled at Bagram en route from Camp Bastion, a British military base in Afghanistan, to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. CNN's Tom Watkins contributed to this report.","A National Airlines jet crashed shortly after takeoff from Bagram Air Base on April 29 .

"(CNN) -- A Pennsylvania minister was found guilty in a church trial on Monday for officiating his son's same-sex wedding, according to church officials. Frank Schaefer, 51, the pastor at Zion United Methodist Church of Iona in Lebanon, Pennsylvania, was found guilty by a jury of 13 ordained clergy members on two counts: officiating a same-sex wedding and being disobedient to the discipline and order of the church, according to Cathy Husid-Shamir, a Schaefer family spokesperson. Schaefer told CNN's Zoraida Sambolin that his son, Tim, asked him to officiate his wedding seven years ago, and he decided to do it ""out of love for him."" Despite at one point believing that homosexuality was incompatible with his Christian beliefs, Schaefer told CNN his views on the controversial topic began to change over time. ""By the time our son came out I was ready to embrace him,"" Schaefer told Sambolin on November 14. The complaint was filed by one of Schaefer's church members and the church leadership decided to act upon it, according to Schaefer. The church told Schaefer he could avoid a trial if he agreed never to perform another same-sex marriage again, but he refused. ""I can't commit to a statement like that,"" Schaefer said. ""Especially in light of the fact that I have two more children that are gay."" ""We want to express care and concern for everyone involved in this difficult process,"" Michele Bartlow, district superintendent of the United Methodist Church, said in a statement following the guilty verdict. ""We ask for prayer."" The penalty phase of the trial begins on Tuesday and new witnesses will be heard, Husid-Shamir told CNN.

"(CNN) -- Many moons ago, when backpacking around Europe, I decided to treat myself to a gelato in the Italian city of Florence. It had been a few tough days of not really appreciating the art, architecture and history enough -- no matter how many hours I had devoted to museums. The feet were sore and the mind was well, over it. After all, at some point, ancient cathedrals all start to look the same. ""How many flavors?"" I was asked. The ice cream was beautifully presented in that Italian way that makes the gelati look soft, smooth and perplexingly weightless. In hindsight, the well-polished checkered tile floor and pristine, clear glass display cabinets should have alerted me that this was no ordinary gelati joint. Being greedy and indecisive, but mostly greedy, I opted for three. The attendant got her gelati scraper spoony thing and proceeded to lavish layer upon layer of lemon, strawberry and pistachio ice cream, to create the Monte Bianco of cones. My eyes were huge. They got bigger when she asked me to pay. The amount, it was lire back then, roughly translated to about $30 -- way out of budget for any tight-fisted backpacker, let alone an Australian. The only thing greater than my outrage at the cost was the look of disdain on the attendant's face when I un-artfully negotiated the cost of the gelato down to around $10 (still way too high in my opinion, but it was a tricky situation and I wanted to pretend I had at least some pride). She artfully negotiated her scraper spoony thing around the ice cream and shaved off way more than two thirds, leaving me with the undernourished, poor cousin of what was once a giant gelato cone. Lesson learned. Don't order more than you can afford and avoid posh, well-positioned shops near tourist sites. And don't do pistachio. Among gelati royalty, lemon, or limone, remains king and queen. British tourists stung . A similar lesson hit a group of British tourists this week in Rome, according to media reports. They got stung 64 euros ($84) for four gelati. Chicken feed, I say when compared to my ice cream incident, at a smidgen over $20 per gelato. According to one report, the Via della Vite managers confirmed the cost of the treats and defended the pricing, saying they were large ice creams. ""No one forced them to order big ice creams. We also serve small ones which only cost â‚¬2.50 ($3.30). But if you want a lot of ice cream then it is worth the price. And the prices are displayed everywhere,"" a manager told the UK's The Daily Telegraph. According to the report, the tourists coughed up the money. ""And when we paid up, they didn't even say thank you,"" Mr Bannister, of Birmingham was quoted as saying. You'd hope it was pretty tasty. This leads to this question, what has been your biggest travel rip off? Sure, we all moan about costs of visas (I am singling you out, Uncle Sam and your $160 non-refundable visa processing fee. Oh, and you too, Mr $250-a-day Bhutan), international phone roaming and hotel Wi-Fi but often those charges are simply unavoidable. It is the ones we are not prepared for, such as a super dooper pricey ice cream cone, that often sting us most. We've all had our own version of the Great Firenze Incident of 2000, so get out the gelati spatula and serve up your greatest, or worst, travel rip off in the comments box below.","British tourists charged $84 for four gelati in Rome .

"(CNN) -- Seven children were killed by a mine that exploded at a road where they were playing in eastern Afghanistan on Monday afternoon, a spokesman for a provincial governor said. The deaths add to what the United Nations says is the hundreds of children killed this year in explosions or fighting between Afghan government forces and insurgents. The children were playing in the Khairkut district of Paktika province when, around 3 p.m., they triggered a mine that had been planted at the road, said Mukhlis Afghan, a spokesman for the province's governor. Afghan blamed what he said are the enemies of peace in Afghanistan for planting the mine, without naming the Taliban or any other insurgent groups. In the first six months of this year, 231 children were killed and 529 were injured in Afghanistan, according to the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan. The leading cause, it said, was improvised explosive devices, including mines used by insurgent groups. The second-leading cause, according to the report, was fighting between insurgents and Afghan forces.","Children were playing near a road when they triggered a mine, spokesman says .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Poultry workers moving to and from wet markets and farms may be responsible for the spread of the deadly H7N9 virus in China, says a virologist who's working with the World Health Organisation to investigate the outbreak. University of Hong Kong clinical virologist Malik Peiris told CNN the closure of Shanghai's poultry markets on April 6 had resulted in a sharp drop in the number of human cases in the city. ""That is clear evidence that the poultry markets are the primary source of human infection,"" he said. Peiris, who visited regions hit by the virus as part of a joint WHO mission last month, added that studies of earlier H5N1 bird flu outbreaks in Hong Kong had shown that the virus can move between live poultry markets and clean farms through contaminated cages and other exposed items, and this was a likely explanation of how the virus was being transmitted around China. ""That's how this infection can keep on zigzagging in this way,"" he said. Since H7N9 was first identified in March, 128 cases have been detected in 10 provinces and 26 people have died, according to figures released on May 2 by the WHO. In addition to markets in Shanghai, China has also temporarily closed live poultry wholesale markets in Jiangsu, Fujian, Jiangxi, Anhui, Guangdong and Zhejiang provinces. Health authorities are still investigating the possible sources of infection and Peiris said there was still much work to be done on how the virus had jumped to humans and how it was being spread. WHO assistant director general Keiji Fukada said in a press conference in Beijing on April 24 that H7N9 was one of the most lethal influenza viruses seen so far and unusually dangerous for humans. The international health body has stressed there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission of the virus, but Peiris said that it was difficult to ascertain whether clusters of cases within the same family were the result of ""limited human-to-human transmission or whether these people have been exposed to the same source"" -- such as by visiting the same live poultry market. A large-scale study of blood samples being conducted in China would shed light on whether there had been milder or undiagnosed cases of H7N9 in the wider population -- a key factor in determining the mortality rate, said Peiris, who played a key role in identifying the virus that caused SARS. ""Even if there is limited human-to-human transmission, that doesn't necessarily have any dire consequences because limited human-to-human transmission has been reported for a long time with H5N1."" The visible impact of the virus could also reduce as the hot summer weather approaches but it was unlikely to die out and might re-emerge in winter, Peiris added. CNN's Fang Ke and Zhang Dayu contributed to this report from Beijing .","Virologist says poultry trade may be spreading deadly bird flu virus .

"(CNN) -- Just a few days after Pope Francis decried capitalism, Argentine lawmakers weighed a new way to honor him: putting his face on a coin. A proposal to create a commemorative coin as a tribute to Latin America's first Pope passed in Argentina's lower house on Thursday, Rep. Oscar Cachi Martinez said in a post on his official Facebook page. Martinez first proposed the measure in April, and it garnered approval from congressional committees earlier this month. Now the bill will be sent to the South American county's Senate for consideration. The goal of the coins, according to the text of the proposed law, is ""to commemorate an event of global dimensions, so our present and future generations remember this splendid act in the history of humanity, in which the principal actor is an Argentine."" Beneath the Pope's face, the coins would read, ""Tribute from the Argentine People to Pope Francis."" Catholic faithful across Latin America cheered the election of Pope Francis earlier this year. Even though about 480 million of the world's 1.2 billion Catholics live in the region, for centuries, the church's top job had gone to Europeans. That changed with the announcement that then-Argentine Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio, who served as archbishop of Buenos Aires, would become the new Pontiff. Many Argentines were overjoyed. But the news was met with a more tepid response from President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, who sent a dry letter of congratulations that failed to mention that Francis was the first Pope from Argentina and the Western Hemisphere. Several years before, Fernandez's government had sparred with Bergoglio in a notorious war of words over a gay marriage law the President backed. But since his election in March, Francis has made headlines by decrying the iniquities of modern capitalism, embracing the poor and people with disabilities and reaching out to gays and lesbians. At the same time, the 77-year-old pontiff has sought to to awaken a spirit of joy and compassion in the church, scolding Catholic ""sourpusses"" who hunt down rule-breakers and calling out a ""tomb psychology"" that ""slowly transforms Christians into mummies in a museum."" And Martinez says there's no doubt Pope Francis is already leaving his mark. ""To this Argentine who, for being a good pastor to his flock, especially to those who most need him, we all owe a tribute, a great tribute,"" Martinez said in a post about the initiative on his official website, making the case for Argentina's lawmakers to act. ""We believe that the way of being, the charisma and the humility of Pope Francis have managed to revive global sympathy for the Catholic Church,"" he said. CNN's Daniel Burke contributed to this report.","NEW: A proposal to create a coin honoring Pope Francis passes lower house .

"(CNN) -- Like Amanda Berry, who ran to freedom Monday after years in captivity, Tonia Carmichael was abducted and held by a male captor not far from her Cleveland home. Berry, whom police took to safety along with two other women they rescued from a home at 2207 Seymour Ave., could be seen healthy and beaming in a photo snapped Monday at an area hospital. She endured 10 years of confinement, but her life will go on. Carmichael was less fortunate. Her life and those of 10 others ended just over five miles away in the notorious ""House of Horrors,"" at 12205 Imperial Ave., at the hands of convicted sex offender Anthony Sowell, who had moved to the address after serving 15 years in prison for attempted rape. Many of their bodies were exhumed in October 2009 from shallow graves on Sowell's property. When news of the serial killing broke back then, the investigation revealed that all of the victims had ties to the neighborhood where they died. Things in common . At that time, the grisly graveyard at Sowell's Cleveland home made Berry's aunt think of her lost niece. ""She's got to be around (her neighborhood) somewhere then,"" Gale Mitchell told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Monday. Indeed, Mitchell was onto something. Berry and one of the other women, whom police say Ariel Castro held captive, disappeared from the same neighborhood, within five blocks of each other, starting in 2003. The third one was last seen about two miles away from the neighborhood, according to the Cleveland Plain Dealer. Berry was 16 when she vanished on April 21, 2003, after she left her job at a Burger King just a few blocks away from home, the FBI said then. Mitchell never gave up hope that Berry was still alive. ""Me and my daughter -- neither one did,"" she said. She was ecstatic when she heard her niece is free and still alive. ""I'm just happy and excited,"" she said. ""It's just so great!"" Unfortunately, Berry's mother, Louwana Miller, died in 2006. She did not live long enough to share in the joy. ""She went with a broken heart,"" Mitchell lamented. Berry and the two others had something else in common: They were teenagers at the time of their abductions. Georgina DeJesus was 14, when she went missing. Michele Knight was 19. House of Horrors . The House of Horror victims also had a common profile: They were all African-American mothers who had hit upon hard times. Almost all of them struggled with drug addiction at some time in their lives, and many turned to prostitution and stealing to support their habits, according to court records. Carmichael, who was 52 when she vanished, had routinely left home for days or weeks at a time. So, on November 10, 2008, when her children heard she was missing, it seemed, sadly, like nothing new. She was gone. Four women had fallen victim to Sowell before her. Six more followed her. Most of them were over 40. They all disappeared in the same neighborhood, and their bodies lay on one man's property. Apparently no one noticed. Carmichael's body was the first to be identified. Her remains were unearthed from a grave in the backyard, decayed beyond recognition, except for plastic jewelry falling off her skeletal fingers. Police believe the women were easy prey for Sowell. Nobody cared? Criminologists say serial killers often target people whose lives may be messy or off the grid -- prostitutes, runaways and drug users -- because their absences might not raise red flags, even for their families. After pleading not guilty by reason of insanity, Sowell was convicted in July 2011 of 11 murders, a few rapes and other related charges, according to the Cleveland Plain Dealer. The court sentenced him to death. After the bodies were discovered, other women came forward, alleging Sowell attacked them. His home was in a neighborhood that care forgot. His two-story house sat in a dilapidated neighborhood known as Mount Pleasant, where one in five homes were in foreclosure and at least a third of the residents receive food stamps, according to a study by Case Western Reserve University's Center on Urban Poverty and Community Development. Neighbors and even a councilman had failed to realize that a stench wafting in the area around Sowell's home was rotting human flesh. Some in the neighborhood complained then that another factor may have been in play: No one cared when 11 destitute African-American women died. Trend: escaping alive . More and more people who were abducted escape alive, a spokesman for a nonprofit organization that tracks missing children told Anderson Cooper. ""We are seeing more of them being found as survivors like the three women in Cleveland,"" said John D. Ryan, CEO of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. But years in captivity can turn into decades of confinement. ""We actually celebrated this past summer the longest recovery of a missing person,"" Ryan said. A boy kidnapped at age 2 was found 41 years later and reunited with his mother. Despite the proximity of the House of Horrors and the similarities between these two grim cases, there is one difference that many were cheering Monday. The girls who were allegedly abducted and held at 2207 Seymour Ave. made it out alive.","The abductions of women freed Monday have things in common with the ""House of Horrors""

"(CNN) -- ""The name's Bond, Commander Bond."" Words uttered by the world's most famous secret agent who is adored by his country, feared by the bad guys and trained by Britain's Royal Navy. I have just spent three years with the Royal Navy and written the ""Royal Navy Way of Leadership"" commissioned by the Commander in Chief of the Royal Navy and issued to 15,000 personnel. I spent long spells at sea on all types of vessel; I followed officer training with the Surface Fleet and with the Royal Marines. Never have I found a more cheerful, consistent and yet flexible and innovative working environment. The Royal Navy is expert at planning, measuring and executing -- the key management disciplines; it does these things highly professionally as it moves throughout the 140 million square miles of the world's oceans. Here's the surprising thing: the Royal Navy runs on ""soft skills"" (and never on shouted orders). These are the qualities of character and culture that are remarkably resilient and, most importantly, instilled in all Royal Navy personnel. They understand the uses of commitment, loyalty, integrity, respect and cheerfulness in ways that the commercial and public sector can only dream of. Read more: Top business brains on success . What I learned is that when people gather together to achieve an end (excellence in military operations or in business for example), what gets things done is those soft skills. And where two groups attempt the same thing, the successful group will be the one whose leaders understand how to use those soft skills in motivating their people and maintaining their effort. The soft skills are pretty easy to identify and pretty hard to learn. They are a form of emotional intelligence. Produce a workplace with the soft skills, and your people will flourish. And remember that half the Royal Navy at any one time might be working in an office (even at sea or on land deployment), so their workplace is much more like yours or mine than you think. Take cheerfulness. Are you happy at work? Happy with what you are being told to do, or with what you are asking your people to do? Happy that your commitment and hard work are being nourished? Do you work for someone cheerful? Or are you happy to follow a pessimist? Read more: Neurotics at work aren't all bad . Here is the opportunity. There are over 1.5 million people employed in FTSE 250 companies in the UK; a further 13.8 million in small and medium-sized enterprises nearly three quarters of a million in London. All contain managers, whose job it is to do things right, and leaders, whose job it is to do the right thing. Improve leadership at work, and you improve the lives of over 15 million people. And in this current uncertain and fast-moving global environment, there is even more need for leadership of the right kind. Doing the right thing means three things: looking after your shareholders, looking after your customers, and looking after your people. And it's in the latter where leaders fail. They tend to lack the emotional intelligence, the subtlety of character to elicit the best from their people when times get tough. These are not matters for management but for leadership. So here is the take-home -- or better, take-to-work -- advice for leaders. This is military philosophy applied to everyday working life. First, develop soft skills and see how employees who are trusted, valued, respected and treated cheerfully actually begin to flourish and prosper. In a recession, if money is not the first reward, then improving the individual's relationship with work should be. Your people will achieve more with fewer resources. Second, figure out your ethos or culture -- ""It's the way we do things around here."" If you achieve this, then customer service becomes a reality rather than a hopeful promise; innovation is inculcated into the way everyone thinks all the time; honesty is not a matter of compliance but a matter of fact. Third, be clear in your thinking and you will be more efficient. The Royal Navy works with what the military call Mission Command, which sets out the intent, strategy, resources, contingency and inspiration for any large-scale activity (it actually derives from Nelson's order of battle set out a month before Trafalgar). The simplicity is compelling because it works. And it has been tested in all manner of fast, dangerous, uncertain and difficult conditions for hundreds of years. Read more: Army field doctors' team-building triage . How about when things go wrong? Sir Edmund Hillary, the first man up Everest, used to say that if you were in real trouble in a difficult place you needed an explorer called Ernest Shackleton, because he understood his people, knew how hard it was to lead well, and was prepared to do the right thing. Shackleton never lost a man in the Antarctic, despite being marooned there in 1915, because he understood his people, got them to make sacrifices for the common good, and earned their love and respect. The love and respect found in Shackleton's crew really count commercially. A Mercer survey in the U.S. last year found that half of U.S. employees were unhappy at work, and that a third were thinking of leaving their organization; even worse, 20% of U.S. workers were disgruntled and yet loath to move on. The declines in productivity from ignoring the soft skills are huge. Conversely, high-performing teams tend to have high levels of employee engagement and satisfaction. They depend on shared culture, goals, and methods; which is precisely what makes the Royal Navy so good at getting things done. A survey by Aon Hewitt last year found that employee engagement must be over 67% if a company has any hope of success: the average UK level is 57% (the lowest since 2008). The soft skills that create happiness at work are not expensive to develop. Yet we know CEO tenure is short and therefore leadership/business culture -- the vital essence that carries continuity -- is suffering. It takes time to develop something worthwhile. Yet it is a formula understood instinctively by every navy captain, every galley chef, every officer of the watch. How people are at work affects how they work. The culture counts. If businesses can get this right, like the Royal Navy, it will be revolutionary. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andrew St George.","Royal Navy runs on soft skills more than shouted orders .

"(CNN) -- A strong bomb blast shook one of the main courthouse buildings in central Athens on Thursday morning, Greek police said. Also Thursday morning, a bomb exploded in front of the Greek Embassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina. It is not known whether the blasts are linked. The explosion in Athens occurred about 40 minutes after an unidentified person placed warning calls to a local TV station and newspaper, saying a bomb would explode outside the ""administrative first instance courthouse.""  The advance notice gave police enough time to evacuate the building. Police said the blast came from a motorbike rigged with explosives that was parked in the median across from the courthouse in the Ambelokipi district.  The caller provided the plate number on the bike. A cloud of smoke was visible in the area and there was some damage to the front of the building and nearby cars from the explosion. In the Argentine capital, no one was injured in the blast at the Greek embassy, the state-run Telam news agency reported. The explosion happened about 2 a.m. (midnight Wednesday ET), police said, according to Telam. The bomb was left at the entrance to the embassy. The blast broke some windows on the embassy building and other properties on the block, the news agency reported. Journalist Elinda Labropoulou contributed to this report.","NEW: A bomb goes off at the Greek Embassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina .

"(CNN) -- For those out there worried that our nation's stern gun laws were keeping firearms out of the hands of too many people, the solution appears to have arrived: the printable gun. Produced by a nonprofit organization called Defense Distributed, this small plastic gun, dubbed the ""Liberator,"" has been tested and is able to fire a bullet in a video demo. Assuming this is no crazy hoax, the ramifications of such a weapon for gun control are potentially profound. I can't imagine that too many people with rational minds think printable guns will add to the serenity of the world. Granted, 3-D printers aren't yet a household item, but as technology improves and becomes less expensive, they may become common. Although the ""Liberator"" appears unreliable, tending to fragment after a few shots, subsequent models will likely improve. Either way, it's a workable and untraceable gun. Open source guru Eric Raymond has said, ""I approve of any development that makes it more difficult for governments and criminals to monopolize the use of force."" The development of the printable gun seems to be particularly popular with the ultra-libertarian crowd. The founder of Defense Distributed apparently describes himself as a crypto-anarchist. It's difficult to envision a situation in which a law-abiding homeowner prints a gun for self-defense. Sure, a few people may print the darn things for the novelty of it. But the printable gun, assuming it moves forward unregulated, would be the obvious realm of the criminal. Can't pass a background check? No need to take your chances, such as they are, at a gun show anymore. Just print out your weapon from home! As only the firing pin is metal (a household nail), I can only imagine the nightmare of trying to detect these things. Most homicides are impulsive, not the cold calculated affairs of Agatha Christie novels. Would enraged individuals without a gun be able to print one of these in response to some perceived slight? Yes, they'd have to go buy a bullet (and a nail), but it's still a way around a background check. This scenario seems foolish only because it's already so easy to get a real gun. There are approximately 300 million guns in the United States. If we want to reduce the number of homicides (or suicides for that matter), making it difficult to get immediate access to guns can help reduce impulsive behaviors. Allowing people to print their own gun is just the opposite. Beyond a doubt, calmer heads will want to regulate these things. I'm not a lawyer, but I suspect this is one example in which technology may have raced ahead of the law. Is Defense Distributed selling guns or information? Is this a gun control issue or a First Amendment issue? Can the printers be regulated to refuse to print weapons, or could new designs simply circumvent existing prohibited products? Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, has expressed interest in legislation to block printable guns , so we'll see where it leads. As he puts it, ""We're facing a situation where anyone -- a felon, a terrorist -- can open a gun factory in their garage and the weapons they make will be undetectable. It's stomach-churning."" It seems that way. Don't get me wrong. I'm probably about as neutral as anyone can be on the issue of gun control. I believe law abiding citizens have constitutional rights to own weapons. But at the same time I believe in reasonable safeguards to make sure access to firearms is limited from criminals and those with chronic mental illnesses. In this sense, to me, printable guns are a step in the wrong direction. Granted, the actual impact of printable guns on societal violence is obviously unknown. Perhaps they'll remain so unreliable or difficult to assemble from the individual pieces that the impact will be negligible. Or perhaps not. Some have described Defense Distributed's efforts as a kind of political performance art. Very funny, Defense Distributed. We get it. I just hope we don't regret it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Christopher J. Ferguson.","A group used 3-D printer to make a plastic handgun that can fire a real bullet .

"(EW.com) -- It was the McDonald's of video rental chains. The company that squashed countless local mom-and-pop video stores; its ubiquitous blue-and-yellow signs blanketing the country, cities and suburbs alike, with the promise of a largely efficient, largely impersonal, sometimes painless video rental experience. By 2004, Blockbuster Video had 9,000 remarkably similar-looking locations. By every retail business standard, Blockbuster Video had won. Then, slowly, as The New York Times put it earlier today, ""Internet killed the video store."" Blockbuster eventually adapted to changing technology and consumer habits, but not fast enough. There were struggles. Netflix. Policy changes. No late fees! Store closures. Late fees are back again! Ownership change. And in January, the chain will be gone, shuttering its remaining stores and DVD mail service. Some are posting fond remembrances of Blockbuster. You can't spend that many hours of your life somewhere, especially if it was during your youth, and not have some emotional attachment to the place. But let's face it: Blockbuster was never cool. It was never really the good guy, or a company you cheered for. So let's tell it like it really was. Here's 10 things we won't miss about Blockbuster Video: . 1. The wrong movie is in the box. These first few entries listed could be said about video stores in general. But once Blockbuster Video conquered the known video rental world, Blockbuster Video was ""the video store."" The company became synonymous with what a video store is, and its downfall is largely because it kept being just a video store. So these are fair game. So: You get home from Blockbuster. You have your overpriced 2-liter soda and movie-theater-sized box of Skittles and your movie. You go to the DVD player and open the box. And then: ""WHERE IS STARSHIP TROOPERS? THIS IS FLATLINERS!"" 2. The scavenger hunt. The clerk's computer says there's one copy of Office Space in the store. But its not where it should be on the shelf. Maybe it's behind another movie? Maybe its stacked in the wrong category? It couldn't be under ""Drama"" could it? ""Where is it? You said you had a copy in stock. Where is it!?"" So you go on a scavenger hunt around the store with the clerk trying to find that missing copy of Office Space because you're really in the mood for Office Space and your heart was set on watching it. The best part of this is when the poor schlub clerk gets on his hands and knees and goes through the return bin to see if it's buried under copies of Titanic. Then he finally says maybe Office Space was stolen. STOLEN. You know, like your time. 3. The unkind. Now we're going way back: Blockbuster was normally pretty decent about staying on top of this, but we can't do a post on video store gripes without mentioning those VCR tapes that were not rewound. ""Be Kind, Rewind."" Also: Scratched /unplayable rentals. 4. The New Releases mirage. Blockbuster-specific gripes now: You think you're not too late to get a copy of The Fellowship of the Ring even though its Friday night and it just came out this week, because there's a whole section of the New Releases wall filled with copies of the film. But remember: The movie artwork boxes are hollow. The boxes with the actual discs are in the Blockbuster boxes behind the artwork boxes. None of the false-front boxes have movies behind them. It's a trick! The display wall is a total mirage. Blockbuster succeeded in looking fully stocked with the latest movies, even when there's not one copy in the store. Fooled you! Now go see if a copy of Legend is in, loser! 5. Late fees. Of course. Late fees. Once you rented a Blockbuster video, the clock was ticking. You better watch it the first night, especially if it was a coveted New Release. Those dollar-a-day fees stack up quick. And there's an unholy checking-account-crippling $60-80 full replacement fee lurking if you ever actually lost one of those boxes. For all their brightly lit stores, Blockbuster Video operated like the grim gang in Goodfellas: ""Oh you forgot to return a DVD by midnight? F--k you, pay me! You returned it with the wrong disc? F--k you, pay me!"" 6. Prudishness. You had to get your porn elsewhere. Okay. But even NC-17 films of some artistic/entertainment merit were banned by the chain in the 1990s, which was yet another blow against studios looking for a way to distribute NC-17 films. In other words: If you really wanted to appreciate Elizabeth Berkley causing a minor tsunami in a swimming pool in Showgirls, you couldn't get it at Blockbuster. 7. Indie/foreign film? Ha! It's called Blockbuster Video for a reason, film geek. You want an art film, or something with something nutty like subtitles, you best go someplace else. But Blockbuster will have 71 copies of Enemy of the State. 8. Those uniforms. During its heyday, Blockbuster had Disney-style clean-cut rules for its employees, who also had to wear pretty dorky uniforms (rather than dress like, you know, normal people, like at indie video and record stores). A group of male employees actually sued Blockbuster for a 1994 policy that banned male employees from having long hair. Check out this Blockbuster employee training video below. A creepily omniscient training manager who calls himself a ""professional opportunist"" gets rather inappropriate with a teenage clerk and prods her to date a customer's son while harassing her for apparently committing the unspeakable sin of accepting Bon Jovi tickets. (If you find yourself obsessing about this amazing video, which is totally understandable, you'll find a breakdown of it from an ex-employee here). See the original story at EW.com.

"Cebu Port, Philippines (CNN) -- Nearly 3,000 survivors of Typhoon Haiyan disembarked from a Philippines naval ship in Cebu Friday, carrying the few possessions they could take with them. Many cradled exhausted children; a few even carried dogs. Evacuees said they were relieved to have left Tacloban City, which they described as ""dangerous"" and even ""hopeless."" They said they could not get access to food or water and feared people were ransacking homes. ""We have survived the typhoon, but how to survive the dangers there, it was very, very hard to imagine,"" said Maejoy Vero, who left with her one-year-old son. The sea journey from Tacloban City took roughly 24 hours, in a ship normally used for naval transport. Volunteers greeted those who made it to Cebu, the Philippines' second largest city. Evacuees received boxes of fried chicken and rice, as well as water. Members of the Philippines Navy helped the elderly and those in wheelchairs. At least one man was carried off the ship in a stretcher. Medical experts stood by to treat the injured. Dr. Lourdes Sasoy, a member of the medical team at the port, said she had seen everything from spinal cord injuries to skin infections. She had treated ""countless"" patients, none of whom had access to medical care since the storm. The more severe cases were being sent to local hospitals. Many of the evacuees planned to join family members who live elsewhere in the country, often either in Cebu or Manila, the nation's capital. Cars and trucks lined the streets outside the naval port with those waiting to pickup survivors. People with nowhere to go will be transported to evacuation centers here in Cebu. INTERACTIVE: Typhoon's deadly path . At least one local sports center is currently being used to provide shelter to victims, according to local officials, while the government works out more long-term plans. ""We are so tired,"" said Manilyn Asuncion, who was sitting on board with her extended family, while they waited for relatives to arrive. She and her nieces and nephews were among those holding signs of thanks to the Philippines Navy for getting them out. Another ship plans to leave Tacloban in the next day or two. Asuncion's niece, eleven-year-old Misheiguel Cahuday, said she was sad to abandon her home in Tacloban City, but she understood the dangers and was trying to embrace the future. ""I'll have a new life,"" she said. CNN's Anna Coren contributed to this story.","Typhoon survivors arrive in Cebu after 24-hour sea journey from Tacloban .

"(CNN) -- When the European Union recently lifted economic sanctions on Myanmar, it closed a decades-long chapter designed to encourage democratic reform in the country. Although an arms embargo remains in place, the action will send an unequivocal message of ""mission accomplished."" But while the EU is celebrating the ""new Myanmar,"" Rohingya Muslims in the western part of the country are targets in what appears to be an ongoing campaign of government-supported crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing. Killings and arson attacks between ethnic Rakhine Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims first erupted in Myanmar's Rakhine State in June 2012, and were followed in October by well-coordinated attacks on Rohingya populations. More than 125,000 Rohingya were forced into dozens of internally displaced camps while tens of thousands of others fled the country, launching Southeast Asia's newest refugee crisis. Satellite images obtained by Human Rights Watch from just five of the 13 townships that experienced violence since June show 27 unique zones of destruction, including the destruction of 4,862 structures covering 348 acres of mostly Muslim-owned residential property. Myanmar's government has repeatedly characterized what happened as ""inter-communal violence"" between bitter enemies -- Arakanese Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims -- denying any involvement of the state or abuses by state security officials. Since June, I visited several sites of attacks and every major camp for the displaced, interviewing more than 100 victims and witnesses of abuse, as well as some perpetrators of violence. There is extensive evidence of complicity of the state in ethnic cleansing. Following the first wave of violence and without setting foot in Rakhine State, the EU and others were quick to welcome the Myanmar authorities' ""measured response"" to the crisis. A spokesperson for the EU's high representative on foreign affairs, Catherine Ashton, said on June 11, ""We believe that the security forces are handling this difficult inter-communal violence in an appropriate way."" The reality on the ground was very different. Rohingya survivors alleged how in June soldiers not only failed to protect them from arsonist mobs, but opened fire when they attempted to extinguish the fires, killing scores. Government authorities in Arakan State were busy bulldozing mosques, blocking humanitarian aid to Rohingya populations, conducting violent mass arrests of Muslim men and boys, and digging mass graves, impeding accountability. Human Rights Watch located the existence of at least four such grave sites. IN PICTURES: Myanmar's sectarian crisis . Two days after the EU's June statement, a government truck dumped 18 naked and half-clothed bodies near a camp for displaced Rohingya, according to Human Rights Watch. Some of the victims had been ""hogtied"" with string or plastic strips before being executed. The move sent a strong message, consistent with a policy of ethnic cleansing, that the Rohingya should leave Myanmar permanently. ""They dropped the bodies right here,"" a Rohingya man told me on a visit to the grave site. ""Three bodies had gunshot wounds. Some had burns, some had stab wounds."" After the smoke cleared in June, the Arakanese Buddhist monkhood (or the sangha), political operatives, and local government officials allegedly held public meetings in Rakhine State, plotting to drive Rohingya Muslims from their homes. They seized on President Thein Sein's remarks on July 12 that ""illegal"" Rohingya should be sent to ""third countries,"" and they actively worked to isolate Muslim communities from daily necessities and income. Influential groups released public statements calling explicitly for ""ethnic cleansing"" and forced population transfer -- the government took no action to stop them. The planned second wave of violence began on October 22. Thousands of Arakanese reportedly descended by foot and boat on Muslim villages in nine townships, carrying machetes, swords, spears, homemade guns, Molotov cocktails, and other weapons. Plumes of smoke dotted the sky along the fertile patchwork of Arakan State's intra-coastal waterways as entire villages were razed. State security forces once again either failed to provide protection, or actively participated in attacks. On October 23 in Yan Thei, Mrauk-U Township, security forces took away sticks and other rudimentary weapons from Rohingya and enabled an Arakanese mob to kill about 70 villagers, including 28 children, 13 of whom were under age five. Today, tens of thousands of displaced Rohingya are being denied access to humanitarian aid, have their movements restricted, and are unable to return home. They live in segregated, squalid camps without adequate food and health services. In just weeks the monsoon season will flood several IDP sites, intensifying the humanitarian emergency. At the root of the persecution is the question of citizenship. The Myanmar government considers all Rohingya to be immigrants from Bangladesh. They are denied citizenship under discriminatory national legislation from 1982, although many families have resided in Myanmar for generations. Official government statements reject their very existence and refer to them as ""Bengali,"" ""so-called Rohingya,"" or the pejorative ""kalar."" The world should not be blinded by the excitement of Myanmar's political opening. Rohingya are paying for that approach with their lives. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Matthew Smith.","Smith: Despite reforms, ethnic cleansing continues against Myanmar's Rohingya Muslims .

"(CNN) -- As royalty from different parts of the world converged on the Netherlands to watch the monarchy change hands, some of the guests there may have been thinking ahead to the day when they get the top job back home. In Europe, most monarchs are getting old and have been on their thrones for years. Their offspring are grown up and are now waiting in the wings to take their respective crowns. Britain's Prince Charles was in Amsterdam to watch Queen Beatrix hand over to her 46-year-old son Willem-Alexander. He was also in the Netherlands when Beatrix herself took the throne from her mother 33 years ago on Queen Juliana's abdication. Charles's new Dutch counterpart is Amalia, The Princess of Orange, who is nine. Was Charles wondering when his turn would come? Perhaps, but that of course would involve the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II. One thing is for sure -- his 61-year wait as heir to the throne won't end with the abdication of his mother. To the British royals, the word ""abdication"" brings back painful memories of the 1936 crisis when King Edward VIII was forced to relinquish his throne so he could marry the divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson and relinquished his throne. Queen Elizabeth will never abdicate. The other long-serving European Queen, Margrethe of Denmark also sees it as a job for life. However, both Margrethe and Elizabeth are handing more responsibilities to their heirs. One option might be for them to appoint their sons Princes Regent which would mean they would be in charge of royal duties while their mothers kept the title. Crown princes and princesses across Europe look ready to take on the task of modern-day monarchy with all the burdens that some believe can only be carried by younger royals. Opinion: Dutch monarchs teach world's royalty . In Spain, 75-year-old year old King Juan Carlos's popularity has waned. And that's led to suggestions, even among monarchists, that his heir, Crown Prince Felipe and his wife Letizia take over the throne. In Sweden, King Carl Gustaf is 67. He's been on the throne for 40 years and has recently been scandalized in the press. His heir, Crown Princess Victoria is married to Prince Daniel and has a baby daughter, Princess Estelle, as the next two generations there take shape. And over in Norway, King Harald is in his mid-70s with an heir who will be 40 in July. Crown Prince Haakon is married to Princess Mette-Marit. The couple have had two children. iReport: Happy crowds applaud new king . All of these heirs also have something in common that makes them appealing to a modern, more relaxed generation. They have all married outside the aristocracy, making them more accessible and relevant to younger subjects. But while the precedent of abdication has set in the Netherlands, it hasn't yet taken hold elsewhere. However, in an age when the pope resigns, don't be surprised if other older royals take some sort of cue from Beatrix.","Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands hands over the crown to her son .

"(CNN) -- A heavyweight tome of 536-pages ""On China"" was described by the New York Times as ""fascinating, shrewd and sometimes perverse"". Now the analysis of Sino-American relations written by Nobel Peace Prize winner Henry Kissinger, has received an altogether different endorsement, appearing alongside titles such as ""The Complete Roman Army"" and ""The Gruffalo"" in a list of books recommended by the soccer stars of the English Premier League. The eclectic selection forms part of the elite football division's campaign to encourage children to take up reading. The Premier League Reading Stars campaign sees soccer players set literacy challenges for children using online videos, with footballers also recommending their favorite books. ""I encourage everybody to read as much as possible because knowledge is power and makes you a more rounded person,"" said U.S. midfielder Clint Dempsey, Tottenham Hotspur's representative in the Reading Stars program. ""Not every story will interest you but when you find one that does it can be really fun to get wrapped up in the story. ""Unlike in movies and video games, with reading you get the opportunity to paint your own picture, which gives you power and creative influence over the story."" Each English Premier League star picked one book for children and one for adults. Dempsey, who has 94 caps for the U.S. national team, chose Alice Schertle's ""Little Blue Truck"" as his favorite kid's book and J.R.R. Tolkien's magical epic ""The Hobbit"" as his adult selection. Sports biographies featured heavily on the list. Manchester City midfielder Scott Sinclair opted for Pele's autobiography while Arsenal's German defender Per Mertesacker picked out ""A Life Too Short"" -- the story of his former international teammate Robert Enke who committed suicide in 2009. ""On China"" was the choice of Ryan Nelsen, a New Zealander who recently left Queens Park Rangers to become coach of Canadian Major League Soccer team Toronto FC. ""To date Premier League Reading Stars has helped over 44,000 children,"" explained Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore. ""The schools we work in are those that have the most to gain from the program; they have low achievement in literacy and high numbers of children from poorer homes. ""I'm very proud that we are both partners and sponsors of this effective program. Now we're having an even wider impact as everyone can watch their football heroes reading online and answer their challenge questions to win rewards.""","The English Premier League releases list of footballers' favorite books .

"(CNN) -- For the generation of Iraqi artists who came of age under Saddam Hussein's regime in the 1980s, one common subject was the dictator himself, often depicted holding a sword or riding an Arabian horse. Politics aside, those were good days for artists, says Natiq al Alousi, 49, an Iraqi sculptor who considers his commissioned work of Saddam to be an achievement. ""Working as an artist in Iraq, when Saddam Hussein was president, was a golden period for all artists, not just myself. He was supportive of artists and was open to them,"" he says. ""But we weren't open to the world for security reasons, and that's it."" Receiving small recognition from Saddam was important to him as a budding artist, al Alousi says. As a student he entered a large competition -- one that he did not expect to win -- and Saddam attended the event. Upon viewing his work, ""Saddam Hussein himself told me that the idea was nice, and that's the only thing I remember from the whole competition,"" he says. Read more: Bringing Babylon back from the dead . Al Alousi went on to create public sculptures and some that were placed in presidential palaces. Some were made for aesthetics and others to reflect events or issues that the country faced, he says. His memories of the time under Saddam can verge on idyllic. ""There was never a day, for any artist in any form of art, who was forced to work for Saddam Hussein or the country,"" he says. ""We were all happily working, and there were competitions that anyone can participate in."" And when Saddam fell in 2003, so too did al Alousi's statues. He says it is disheartening to think of art being torn down. Now living in Abu Dhabi, al Alousi still sculpts using various mediums, but there are stumbling blocks. Few people there want to buy large statues, he says, and there is not even a foundry for his bronze works. He has to mail molds more than 1,000 miles away to Egypt, and the bronze rarely survives the return journey intact. In Abu Dhabi, ""the art movement is still yet to begin in the right way. It did start, but it needs more solidarity and extra encouragement from certain entities for it to be mature,"" he says. Read more: Rediscovering Iraq's cultural heart . But al Alousi sees these as only minor problems for his art, which he says is the ""purest thing"" in his life, a matter of expression, beauty and experimentation. And he says art has nothing to do with politics or religion. As for his associations with the dictator, it only meant he was at the top of his game. ""I do not regret that I once worked for Saddam Hussein,"" he said. ""This is history. Only the best artists work for presidents.""","Under Saddam Hussein's regime, Natiq al Alousi was commissioned to create works depicting the dictator .

"(CNN) -- On April 27, NASA's Fermi and Swift satellites detected a strong signal from the brightest gamma-ray burst in decades. Because this was relatively close, it was thousands of times brighter than the typical gamma-ray bursts that are seen by Swift every few days. Scientists are now scrambling to learn more. We already knew that when the biggest stars run out of fuel, they don't fade quietly away. Instead, they explode in a blaze of glory known as a supernova. These stellar explosions are often bright enough to be seen by us even though they are in galaxies billions of light-years from our own Milky Way galaxy home. In very rare cases -- such as GRB130427A (tagged with the date of its discovery) -- astrophysicists are lucky enough to see energetic gamma-rays from hyperfast jets of outflowing material consisting of charged particles created during a massive star's violent death throes. This means GRB130427A's jets must be aimed toward Earth -- purely by chance, of course. For every jet pointed at us, there are hundreds of exploding stars across the universe whose jets point randomly in other directions. Telescopes on other planets in those directions could see those jets, and we might see the exploding stars as supernovae, but we don't see the bright gamma-ray flashes from jets beamed away from us. In the hours after this unusual gamma-ray burst was discovered, astrophysicists rushed to learn more. Thanks to observations made with the Gemini ground-based optical telescope in Hawaii, it quickly became clear that GRB130427A was superbright primarily because it lay only a few billion light years away. Had it been situated in a much more distant galaxy -- as many gamma-ray bursts are -- its signal would have been relatively feeble. The proximity of GRB130427A means we can learn a great deal about it. For example, most of the energy from supernovae is thought to be carried away by neutrinos -- the lightweight, difficult-to-detect particles that are so important to understanding the fundamental laws of nature. The world's most powerful neutrino telescope, IceCube, uses Antarctic ice as the detector volume, with electronic equipment sunk throughout a cubic kilometer of ice -- enough water to fill a million swimming pools -- to detect signals from neutrinos interacting with the ice. If there is a supernova associated with this gamma-ray burst, a big optical flash should be seen any day now by ground-based telescopes, preceded by a flood of neutrinos. (The neutrinos are emitted at the time of collapse, while the optical light is the consequence of explosive debris hitting material surrounding the star a bit later.) Interestingly, an April 18 paper in the journal Nature reported that upper limits for neutrinos measured from IceCube are low enough that gamma-ray bursts are unlikely to be the sole source of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. Just nine days later, the bright nearby burst happened, leading to the Fermi detection of the highest energy gamma-ray ever. Now there is a real chance IceCube will make the first detection of astrophysical neutrinos, from the supernova associated with GRB130427A. Want to know more technical details? Here is some background information about light and about the deaths of stars: . Gamma-rays are the most energetic form of light, with wavelengths far shorter than ordinary optical light (the light your eye can see), or even ultraviolet or X-ray light. The energy of a packet of light -- or ""photon"" -- is inversely proportional to its wavelength. Since the wavelength of an X-ray photon is approximately 1/1,000 of the wavelength of optical light, for example, an X-ray photon has 1,000 times the energy of an optical photon. This is why X-rays can penetrate your skin and soft tissue -- though not bone -- while sunlight mostly reflects off your skin. Gamma-rays have thousands to millions or even billions of times the energy of ordinary sunlight. Being highly energetic, they are hard to produce and very rare. So when we detect gamma-rays from space, we know they signal intensely hot, extreme events. Stars, such as our sun, are giant balls of gas held together by gravity. Acting alone, gravity would cause stars to collapse completely, but as long as energy is produced at their centers by nuclear fusion (the joining of atomic nuclei to form new elements, as in a hydrogen bomb), the star is heated and puffed up. During this phase, stars radiate that heat, shining brightly like our sun, mostly at optical wavelengths. It is an interesting triple ""coincidence,"" which probably evolved over time, that our eyes are most sensitive to yellow-green light, which happens to be the characteristic color of sunlight as well as the color that can most easily be transmitted through the Earth's atmosphere. When nuclear fusion uses up a star's fuel, in the central high-pressure stellar core where fusion occurs, the star will collapse fairly violently. Depending on its initial mass, it might collapse to a compact hot star known as a white dwarf (when the star's mass is less than 1.4 times the mass of our sun) or to a neutron star (for stars 1.4 to about three times the mass of our sun) or to a black hole (for stars more massive than three times the mass of our sun). A black hole collapse is very violent and not well understood at present. Theorists believe the rapid collapse generates heat that ignites the explosion. The explosive energy is released in the form of neutrinos, light (mostly gamma-rays), and a pair of relativistically outflowing emitting jets. That's why an event such as GRB130427A probably signals the collapse of a massive star into a black hole. Incidentally, if not for supernovae, we wouldn't be here. Every single atom of your body that is not hydrogen or helium was created in the fiery interior of a massive star. The supernova explosion disperses these elements throughout interstellar space, where they become the building material for new planets. When Earth formed out of such materials -- iron, manganese, calcium, silicon, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, etc. -- organic chemicals, then cells, then organisms, then humans were able to evolve. In the 1960s, NASA launched the first gamma-ray satellites to look for signals of intense radioactive decay on Earth, which could be generated by nuclear explosions. In other words, detecting gamma-rays was a way to spot nuclear tests. Years later, scientists examining data from the Vela satellites found gamma-ray bursts -- but they were coming from space, not from human activities on the ground. Since that time, gamma-ray bursts have been one of the most interesting phenomena in the cosmos. They are incredibly luminous, with most of the energy of a stellar explosion packed into a few seconds or less, so they represent a kind of extreme physics. Thousands of gamma-ray bursts have been studied for more than 40 years. Because of its proximity, GRB130427A generated more gamma-rays, over a longer time and at higher energies, than any detected previously by the Fermi or Swift satellites. Astrophysicists can't be successful just because they are clever and hard-working. They also have to be lucky. On April 27, nature smiled on the Earth's astrophysical community in the form of GRB130427A, a powerful laboratory for understanding relativistic jets, black holes and stellar collapse. Now the experimental analysis begins. More space and science news at CNN Light Years .

"(CNN) -- An Air Force officer who served as a branch chief for the service's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response program was arrested and charged with sexual battery over the weekend. Lt. Col. Jeffrey Krusinski, 41, has been removed from current duty, an Air Force official said Monday. The official declined to be named because it is an ongoing law enforcement matter. Krusinski was placed in charge of a section of the service's sexual assault prevention and response program in February, running a five-person office, the Air Force official said. He was arrested just after midnight Saturday in Arlington, Virginia, and is accused of grabbing a woman's breasts and buttocks, Arlington County police said. Police said the woman fought off her assailant when he tried to grab her again before she called authorities. Krusinski was held on a $5,000 bond. Arlington County police spokesman Dustin Sternbeck said the woman did not know her attacker. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel discussed the matter Monday with Air Force Michael Donley, according to the Pentagon. ""Secretary Hagel expressed outrage and disgust over the troubling allegations and emphasized that this matter will be dealt with swiftly and decisively,"" said George Little, Pentagon press secretary. Krusinski's arrest comes as the Pentagon has been under closer scrutiny from Congress over its handling of sexual assault cases in the uniformed services. ""Sexual assault and rape are not about the weakness of the victim, they're about power and control,"" Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-New Hampshire, said at a March hearing on the issue. ""In a military context, that becomes an even greater problem."" The Defense Department reported 3,192 allegations of sexual assault involving service members in 2011. It's expected to report an increase in 2012, but officials said that it is not clear whether that's due to an increasing number of incidents or because victims are becoming more comfortable in reporting a crime that is often not reported. The department has stepped up efforts to hold perpetrators accountable, establishing a ""special victims unit"" to handle cases, working to improve tracking of reports and speeding transfers for troops who report a sexual assault by a member of their unit. ""Secretary Hagel has been directing the Department's leaders to elevate their focus on sexual assault prevention and response, and he will soon announce next steps in our ongoing efforts to combat this vile crime,"" Little said Monday.

"(CNN) -- Politics might well be a dirty game, but in Malaysia where allegations of vote-buying, sex scandals and violence are a feature of the political landscape, a group of disaffected activists have distilled these predictable shabby tricks into a popular card game. Called Politiko, players are asked to woo voters with cash handouts, use elements of Sharia law to lay low rivals, or pour petrol subsidies on troubled electoral waters. ""Hire phantom voters. Control the media. Cook up a sex scandal to alienate your enemy's supporters - or to betray your own allies!"" says the game's website. ""Choose from 10 distinct (and familiar) political parties to lead to victory. Play with up to six friends, of any race. But are they really your friends? Remember: it's not about the people -- it's about Putrajaya,"" it adds, referring to Malaysia's administrative capital. The tongue-in-cheek game is loosely based on Monopoly Deal but instead of dealing in property, players compete to get voters - the first to hold eight voter cards gets elected to parliament. Before that can happen, players must negotiate the pitfalls of the ""scheme"" cards - either rising on the pork-barrel politics of free highway tolls and urban metro projects, or falling on crumbling allegiances and misplaced racial scapegoating. Typically, the richest person at the card table gets to deal the first card. In an ironic twist, the game has even become popular with some politicians in Malaysia's ruling UMNO coalition, according to the group that developed the card game. The brainchild of 31-year-old designer Mun Kao - part of a group called Loyar Burok, which is affiliated with the Malaysian Center for Constitutionalism and Human Rights (MCCHR) - the game has quickly sold out of its initial run of 850 decks. ""I had the idea about two years ago when there really was a political circus going on - we had some ridiculous things happening in Malaysia,"" Mun Kao told CNN. ""You had people being arrested for the color of their T-shirts and things like that and to me that period was really absurd. ""It prompted a lot of emotions in a lot of people and it's being expressed in different forms. If you have Malaysian friends you can see it on Facebook and online - I think there's a creative expression tsunami going on,"" he said. Malaysian media reports say about 2.6 million of the country's 13.3 million eligible voters will cast their ballots for the first time in a bitterly fought poll that could see the ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition - which has been in power for 56 years - lose to opposition parties for the first time. The number of new voters, many of them without party loyalties, has increased markedly since elections five years ago when there were 638,000 new voters. Analysts say that many young voters may have been encouraged to register by the closeness of the 2008 poll which the ruling coalition only narrowly won. ""We don't have a reliable mainstream media in Malaysia,"" said Chi Too, a communications officer with MCCHR. ""The government owns pretty much all newspapers, all radio stations and TV stations. A lot of people are now relying on social media and alternative media that can be found with online newspapers and the like."" Websites such as Malaysiakini have become popular with young voters, streaming news and views generally unobtainable in Malaysia's mainstream press. Even so, it claims that it has been the victim of censorship tactics that have involved denial of service cyber-attacks on its streaming videos. The Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission investigating the attacks said there were no such restrictions, adding that the public should not speculate until a proper investigation has been carried out. The power of the online campaign has not been lost on the ruling coalition which this year launched the UMNO New Media Unit; a team of 2,000 of what it calls ""cyber-activists"" tasked with logging opposition attacks. On Sunday, voters will be asked to choose between the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, which -- with its predecessor -- has ruled the country for more than five decades, and Pakatan Rakyat (PR), a loose coalition of opposition parties formed after the last election in 2008. BN is led by Prime Minister Najib Razak, the son and nephew of former prime ministers, who has held the post since 2009. PR is headed by Anwar Ibrahim, a former finance and deputy prime minister who served time in prison on corruption and sodomy charges which he says were politically motivated. The first sodomy charge was overturned in 2004 and in January 2012 he was acquitted of a second charge of sodomy, a serious offense in Malaysia which carries a sentence of up to 20 years in prison. In a hard-fought campaign, both parties have been trying to entice voters with promises of generous government spending.","Tongue-in-cheek card game is based on Malaysian dirty politics .

"(CNN) -- Jose Mourinho likes to keep them guessing. Three days after the Real Madrid manager hinted he was on his way back to England and Chelsea, the self-proclaimed ""Special One"" insisted his future was still undecided. Mourinho signed a contract extension until 2016 with Real Madrid last May after ending Barcelona's three-year stranglehold on La Liga, but his relationship with the Spanish press soured and he has clashed with Madrid and Spain's much-loved keeper, Iker Casillas. ""When I decide on my future, my wife and kids will be the first to know, then the president and general director,"" Mourinho told reporters ahead of Real Madrid's game against Real Valladolid. ""I haven't decided to leave. If I go, I will not give explanations."" Despite Mourinho's pronouncement Friday, England's Sun newspaper claimed that he has already agreed to return to Chelsea but that an official announcement was unlikely until July 1. On Tuesday following Real Madrid's exit in the Champions League semifinals for a third straight season under Mourinho, this time to Borussia Dortmund, the 50-year-old, not for the first time, spoke of his deep fondness for England. ""I know in England I am loved,"" Mourinho said. ""I know. I know I am loved by the fans. I am loved by the media that treats me in a fair way, criticizing me when they have to, but giving me credit when I deserve it. I know I am loved by some clubs, especially one."" Tottenham boss Andre Villas-Boas, who worked under his fellow Portuguese and formerly managed Chelsea, said Mourinho resurfacing in the Premier League would be ""spectacular."" With Mourinho at the helm, Chelsea ended a 50-year title drought and won back-to-back Premier League titles. He parted company with Chelsea in 2007 when his relationship with Russian owner Roman Abramovich deteriorated. Even though the Blues won the Champions League in 2012, they finished sixth in the league, failed to advance from this season's group stage and are in danger of not qualifying for the competition next term. Current interim manager Rafael Benitez has already stated he won't be with Chelsea in 2013/2014. ""I have always left clubs in the right way,"" Mourinho added Friday. ""Even Chelsea, which seemed controversial, wasn't so much. When I go I never say anything negative about those clubs, quite the opposite. The day I go I will be wishing Madrid the best for the future. ""Clubs always stay with me. Chelsea did not win the European Cup with me but I was just as pleased when they won it. Madrid will always be special and I want them to win their 10th European Cup. If that's with me, fine. If not, I will enjoy it as much."" He said his past successes -- which include capturing titles in four countries, the Champions League with Inter Milan and steering Madrid to a record points total last season -- have hurt him in the Spanish capital. Once he ended Barcelona's reign in La Liga in 2012, the goal with Real Madrid was to win the Champions League, which hasn't materialized. Madrid's title drought in the Champions League now extends to 11 years. ""It is my fault,"" Mourinho said. ""I have won so, so, so much that it is hard to live up to those expectations. But the points record in the league is mine and no one can take that away."" In a move sure not to boost his popularity in Spain, Mourinho took a swipe at Casillas, who hasn't reclaimed his position as Madrid's No. 1 from Diego Lopez after recovering from a hand injury. ""I should have been more proactive at the end of the first season, more demanding and more insistent,"" Mourinho said. ""We should have brought in Diego Lopez then. I asked but he didn't come. I didn't do enough to bring him in and that's a pity.""","Jose Mourinho says he hasn't decided where he'll be managing next season .

"(CNN) -- After Carmen Tarleton's estranged husband doused her with industrial-strength lye, doctors saved her life with a medically induced coma and more than 50 surgeries. But they could do little about her scar-ravaged face. She was so disfigured that children ran away from her. When TV news shows did stories about her, they warned that the images might be disturbing and advised viewer discretion. For four years Tarleton lived with this reality, plus enormous amounts of pain. Then her plastic surgeon at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston made a suggestion. He'd recently done the first facial transplant in the United States, and he thought it might work for her. At first the idea sounded a bit strange -- going through life with someone else's face? -- but it didn't take long for Tarleton to say yes, and on Wednesday, Tarleton unveiled her new face at a press conference. She doesn't know her deceased donor's name but said she thinks about her every day. ""I have conversations with her and let her know how grateful I am,"" Tarleton, 44, told CNN during a visit Monday to her home in Thetford, Vermont. ""I'm thrilled. I'm thrilled with what I've got."" Doctor: 'We had some sleepless nights' Dr. Bohdan Pomahac had never seen anyone like Tarleton. The director of the burn unit at Brigham and Women's, Pomahac assessed Tarleton's wounds when she came in after the June 2007 attack. The lye had burned more than 80% of her body, and the burns went deep -- all the way through her skin. In 2011, Pomahac and his team made headlines when they performed the nation's first full facial transplant on Dallas Wiens, a Texas man who got too close to a high-voltage line while at work. Tarleton was approved for a full transplant in December of that year. It took about 14 months -- an unusually long time -- to find a donor, because she had so many antibodies in her immune system built up from the blood transfusions and surgeries used to treat her injuries. She had the 15-hour transplant surgery in February, becoming about the sixth person in the United States to get a full facial transplant, according to Pomahac. An animation of the procedure done by the hospital shows how surgeons removed her skin, muscles, tendons, and nerves, replacing them with those of the donor. At first, it didn't go so well. Tarleton's body started to reject her new face -- a rejection so strong doctors feared the transplant might fail. ""We had some sleepless nights,"" Pomahac said. But a well-tailored cocktail of anti-rejection drugs saved Tarleton's new face. 'He was able to see me through my scars' Completely blind in one eye and partially blind in the other, Tarleton is still able to live on her own in her apartment in Vermont. She did have to quit her job as a nurse. Donations she received after she appeared on ""The Doctors"" television show have helped support her and her two daughters, who were 12 and 14 when they witnessed their stepfather attack their mother. Private insurance and Medicare have paid for her medical care. Emotionally, Tarleton has recovered by forgiving her ex-husband, who's now in prison, and by giving inspirational talks and publishing a book, ""Overcome: Burned, Blinded, and Blessed."" In December, she started taking piano lessons from a local teacher named Sheldon Stein. The lessons were before the transplant, when her face was so badly disfigured, but still he fell in love with her. ""He was able to see me through my scars,"" she said. Stein helped her through her February transplant and during her recovery. At first, she had hardly any control over her face, but she can now muster a bit of a smile, and her doctors say with time she should be able raise her eyebrows and make other facial expressions. She especially looks forward to gaining the strength and coordination to kiss the man she calls ""the love of my life."" ""I can't pucker and feel yet,"" she said. ""But I am looking forward to that day. I know that day will come."" CNN's John Bonifield contributed to this report.","Carmen Tarleton was burned over 80% of her body with industrial-strength lye .

"London (CNN) -- Queen Elizabeth II will not attend the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting later this year, Buckingham Palace said Tuesday. The UK queen will be represented at the gathering in Sri Lanka in November by her son, Prince Charles. The reason for the decision is that Buckingham Palace is reviewing the number of long-haul flights the queen takes, a royal source said. The source, who declined to be named in keeping with royal protocol, said the decision was not made because of medical advice. The queen, who's 87, was briefly admitted to a London hospital in March, where she was treated for symptoms of gastroenteritis. Prince Charles, who is the heir to the throne, has accompanied the queen to Commonwealth events in the past, the source said. The queen is the head of the Commonwealth, a voluntary association of 54 countries. Commonwealth Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma said in a statement Tuesday the group of nations ""completely understands and respects"" the queen's decision not to attend. He paid tribute to ""the continuing dedication and deep sense of duty"" the queen brings to her role as head of the Commonwealth. He also welcomed her decision to send Charles to the Sri Lankan capital, Colombo, in her stead, saying there had been ""close links"" between the prince and the Commonwealth over many years. Prince Charles previously attended a Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Kampala, Uganda, in 2007, he added. Commonwealth leaders gather every two years to discuss Commonwealth and global issues, with the last meeting held in Perth, Australia, in 2011. The leaders represent about a quarter of the world's countries and a third of the world's population, according to the Commonwealth secretary-general. They work together toward shared goals in democracy and development, according to the Commonwealth website. After a formal opening ceremony and initial session, the leaders meet in a private setting, it says. ""The atmosphere is informal, encouraging a full and frank exchange of views, and decisions are reached by consensus,"" it says.","NEW: Secretary-general says Commonwealth respects queen's decision not to travel .

"(CNN) -- There may not be a single cemetery in Massachusetts or in the entire country that is willing to be Tamerlan Tsarnaev's final resting place, a funeral director told CNN on Monday. And that has left Peter Stefan in a very difficult spot. ""I think (the cemeteries that have been asked) probably fear reprisals from people who have loved ones being buried there, people who may potentially buy lots there,"" the funeral director said. Tsarnaev and his younger brother, Dzhokhar, are accused of setting off two deadly explosions at the Boston Marathon in April. The funeral director says he is trying to do everything he can, but he's struggling. ""I think a lot of the people don't understand,"" Stefan said. ""And it's an emotional problem, obviously."" But, ""We have to bury this guy,"" he continued. ""Whoever he is, in this country, we bury people."" But outside the funeral home in Worcester, about 40 miles west of downtown Boston, picketers denounced plans to bury the marathon bomb suspect in their community. One held a sign that read, ""Bury the garbage in the landfill."" Bomb suspect's friend out on bail, released to mom . William Breault, chairman of a Worcester civic group, told CNN that Stefan ""made a big mistake"" agreeing to accept the remains, ""and now we're in a situation where nobody wants to take him."" ""I not only don't want to see him buried in Worcester, Massachusetts, very close to where I live, I don't think he should be buried in the state,"" Breault said. He said his organization, the Main South Alliance for Public Safety, is trying to raise up to $5,000 to have Tsarnaev's body shipped overseas. ""He's not a citizen, he shouldn't be given rights,"" Breault said. Meanwhile on Monday, a law enforcement official who spoke to CNN said that investigators believe that Tsarnaev accessed Inspire magazine -- an English-language magazine published by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula -- on a computer in the apartment where he and his wife lived. The Inspire material had instructions on bomb-making, the official said. Asked whether the computer belonged to the husband, his wife, or whether it was shared, the official said only that investigators believe the husband was accessing that material. What are the options? It may be possible to look to the past for guidance on how to handle the remains of notorious figures. Five new things in Boston bombing story . President John F. Kennedy's assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, is buried in the Dallas area, where he lived before shooting Kennedy in 1963. Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh's ashes were scattered after his execution, though where is a mystery. The body of Abraham Lincoln's killer, John Wilkes Booth, lies in an unmarked grave in a Baltimore cemetery where other members of his family are buried. Cremation is not an option because Islam does not allow it, according to Naeem Baig of the Islamic Circle of North America. However, it would not violate Islamic tradition to bury Tsarnaev in an unmarked grave, which may reduce the odds that a cemetery would suffer a backlash for providing space. In fact, it's customary for Muslims to forgo gravestones, according to John Esposito, a professor of international affairs and Islamic studies at Georgetown University. ""That burial could be carried out by simply saying he was buried in a cemetery and burying him without a marker,"" Esposito said. Some might ask why there hasn't been a move to bury Tsarnaev at sea, the way Osama bin Laden was buried. First, bin Laden's body was in the possession of the federal government, which isn't the case with Tsarnaev's body. Secondly, as Baig points out, it wasn't a concern that relatives of bin Laden should be consulted. The United States asked Saudi Arabia if officials objected to burying bin Laden at sea. The Saudis did not. A family matter . In Tsarnaev's case, his parents are alive and in the Russian region of Dagestan. But Tamerlan Tsarnaev held a passport from the former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan, where he was born, so his remains can't be sent to Russia, said Zaurbek Sadakhanov, a lawyer for the parents. Tsarnaev had requested a Russian passport but had not received one, Sadakhanov said. His parents have not asked that his body be brought to Russia -- and in any event, Russian law says the bodies of ""terrorists"" killed by government forces should be buried in an undisclosed location, without the family being notified of the site, he said. Esposito said that although an unmarked grave may not violate Islamic practices, it could certainly run afoul of the courtesy of getting Tsarnaev's parents' permission to conduct their son's burial that way. On Monday afternoon at a media event, Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick stressed that the fate of Tsarnaev's body rests with his family. ""First of all, this isn't a state or a federal issue. It's the family's issue,"" the governor said, responding to a reporter's question. ""And the family has some options. I assume they will make a decision soon. I hope they do. I think everybody is feeling upset about what happened."" A reporter asked: ""Do communities have a right to refuse the body?"" ""I don't know about right,"" Patrick answered. ""I think, if you're asking about legal rights and so forth, I don't know the answer to that. But I understand that the family does have some options, and I expect they will make a decision soon."" Asked if he opposed burying Tsarnaev in Massachusetts, Patrick said, ""I don't have a comment about that or a point of view."" Watch: Imam doesn't want body either . On Sunday, Tsarnaev's uncle Ruslan Tsarni was the only relative at Stefan's funeral home. Tsarni, who decried the bombing suspects as ""losers"" after the attacks, performed the Islamic tradition of preparing a body for burial, washing and shrouding it. He said he had not been in contact with Katherine Russell, his nephew's widow. ""I'm left alone to deal with this matter,"" Tsarni said. ""And I want to stress that Tamerlan Tsarnaev has no other place to be buried. There's no other place who would accept his body."" Cambridge clash . Tsarnaev's uncle wants him buried in Cambridge, Massachusetts, arguing that it's his nephew's home. ""He grew up here,"" Tsarni said. But town officials have strongly rejected the idea. ""The difficult and stressful efforts of the citizens of the City of Cambridge to return to a peaceful life would be adversely impacted by the turmoil, protests, and widespread media presence at such an interment,"" City Manager Robert W. Healy said in a statement Sunday. Stefan suggested Monday that he and the family are considering appealing to a Muslim cemetery outside Massachusetts. And yet, that might not work either, he fears. ""I feel the same problem exists when the neighbors and the people find out what we're doing,"" Stefan said. He added that most of the cemeteries in Massachusetts are nonsectarian with a section set aside for Muslims. ""The only true Muslim cemetery is in Connecticut,"" he said, without naming the cemetery he was referring to. ""At this point, any outcome would be better than nothing,"" Stefan said. And he will continue to try to bring this painful experience -- for everyone -- to an end. Stefan has said that if no grave site is found, he plans to ask the U.S. government to find one. ""This is a big problem, and somebody has to step in and say, 'Look, we're going to have to do something here,' "" he said. CNN's Susan Candiotti, Carol Cratty and Tim Lister contributed to this report.","NEW: Massachusetts group raising money to ship body overseas .

"Moscow (CNN) -- In an apparent attempt to address popular discontent following the recent parliamentary elections in Russia, President Dmitry Medvedev announced sweeping political reform in his fourth -- and last -- annual state-of-the-nation speech Thursday. Medvedev said he hears those ""who are talking about the need for change"" and understands them, agreeing that ""all active citizens should be given a legal opportunity"" to play a larger role in the country's political life. Speaking before the newly elected parliament members in the Kremlin's St.George Hall, Mevdedev proposed that Russia return to direct elections of regional governors, simplify the registration of political parties and presidential candidates, and establish a new editorially-independent national public TV channel. In essence, Medvedev called for lifting many of the political restrictions imposed in the past several years by his predecessor, Vladimir Putin, Russia's current prime minister and the Kremlin candidate for the March 2012 presidential elections. In addition to the modernization of Russia's political system, Medvedev announced a number of new anti-corruption measures and called the redistribution of power and financial resources from the federal government to local governments across the country. At the same time, he rejected widespread public criticism of the parliamentary elections December 4, which were reportedly marred by fraud and other irregularities, and blamed anti-Kremlin opposition figures for their ""attempts to manipulate the people and foment social discord."" ""We will not allow instigators and extremists to involve society in their reckless schemes, nor will we tolerate interference in our internal affairs from the outside,"" Medvedev said. ""Russia needs democracy, not chaos. We need to have a faith for the future and justice. It is a good sign that society is changing, and citizens are expressing their position more actively, setting legitimate demands to the authorities. It is a sign that our democracy is growing more mature."" On December 10, tens of thousands of people across Russia turned out to protest the election results that returned Putin's ruling United Russia party to power, but with a smaller majority. Police estimated crowds in Moscow at 25,000, while organizers said at least twice as many participated. In either case, the protests were the largest in the past two decades. Claiming the results of parliamentary elections were rigged, protesters chanted ""Putin out."" A similar protest is scheduled to take place in Moscow next Saturday. Despite a mostly positive reaction to Medvedev's speech, a number of opposition figures have told Russian media his latest proposals wouldn't have have been made, had there not been a strong public demand for change. And, they said, he still didn't address the issue of what the authorities are planning to do about the recent alleged voting fraud, as well as whether fair and free elections are guaranteed in the future.","Medvedev calls for a larger role for citizens in politics .

"(CNN) -- When Pedro Matos arrived in conflict-ridden Darfur in 2009 to work as a humanitarian worker, the last thing he expected to encounter was dapper dressing and sartorial splendor. ""I was blown away by what I saw,"" says Matos, a former urban planning engineer who went to Western Sudan to work for a United Nations agency supporting internally displaced people (IDP) in a region rocked by violence for a decade now. ""As I got more and more exposed to the camps and to the IDPs, I was taken aback and surprised with what people wore and how different they were from what I was expecting,"" says the Portuguese aid worker. Struck by the eye-catching color combinations and the rich variety of patterns adorning women's clothing, Matos reached for his camera and started taking pictures of Darfur's local fashion. This gave birth to The Darfur Sartorialist, a project aiming to show to the world a different reality of this remote part in Sudan, beyond the usual narrative of suffering and violence. ""The news we usually get about Darfur -- the war, the oppression, the camps -- exists but that is not the only story,"" says Matos. ""I hope the project can make people question the reality we see."" CNN's Inside Africa spoke to Matos, who is now based in Kenya, about fashion in Darfur and his project's goals. CNN: How you'd describe the way these women are dressed in a few words? PM: Colorful -- amidst these deserted landscapes, people dress in incredible colors; unique -- it's extremely difficult to find two women with the same clothes; proud -- there is a pride in the dressing which goes a bit against to what I was expecting to be a conservative way of dressing; fashionable -- a lot of the clothing is traditionally Sudanese but some is also influenced by the Middle East. The traditional Sudanese clothing is the toub -- many meters of cloth that's wrapped around the body and head. Because it often falls off, they have to wear something underneath so that the skin doesn't get exposed. Those combinations are often unique; their undergarment would often be a patterned shirt and trousers, and with the toub, combinations are extremely varied. But on top of that, you have all the influence that comes from the Sudanese diaspora, the soap operas and all the films from the Middle East where women often dress a bit more Westernized; they have dresses, trousers, denim jackets and skirts, so you have a combination of all these things and it's extremely difficult to find two women dressed the same. The variety is something that surprised me; in the West we often have these fashionable dark colors and because there are all these franchise stores, you get to see people dressed pretty much in the same way. But in Sudan, they're so varied. Read this: Congo's designer dandies . CNN: How easy was it taking pictures? Were there any security concerns? PM: Sudan has been in the spotlight for human rights issues for a long time, so they're extremely suspicious of foreigners going around taking photos. But after working side by side for so long with the security services, they eventually ended up trusting me and I was allowed to take pictures. CNN: Did women want to be photographed? PM: That is quite interesting, because Sudan is a society where women are expected to behave conservatively and refuse photographs. So, when I'd take their pictures, they would often refuse if they don't know me. But if I'm taking [pictures] of children, then the women would say, ""OK, you can take photographs of us too."" My colleagues and the IDPs didn't have a problem because they knew me; actually, they were quite happy and honored and flattered that a foreigner would be so interested in their clothing. Read this: Africa's fashion bible . CNN: What has been the feedback you've received? PM: Most people in the West are extremely surprised and most people in Sudan are quite happy that someone is covering Sudan in such way, with many smiles, and proud, fashionable people. But what I'm mostly interested about is to have people in the West -- those who know very little about Darfur, other than the stories of war and kidnapping -- understand that beyond the society we see in the news, it feels perfectly normal and conceivable that alongside war and oppression there are people who live their own lives and have aspirations which are not that different from ours.","Pedro Matos is the creator of the Darfur Sartorialist project .

"Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN) -- The death toll from the disastrous building collapse in Bangladesh last month has risen above 700, authorities said Tuesday, as recovery workers continued to pull bodies from the rubble. The building, which housed five factories full of garment workers, caved in nearly two weeks ago, burying hundreds of people in a heap of mangled concrete in Savar, a suburb of the capital, Dhaka. It is the South Asian nation's deadliest industrial disaster. Rescue workers managed to save more than 2,400 people in the aftermath of the collapse, but their work for the past week has focused on using heavy machinery to uncover the remaining bodies buried inside the ruins. The number of people confirmed dead from the disaster reached 705 on Tuesday, according to Jitendra Kumar Nath, a senior official with the district administration of Dhaka . A large number of people have continued to wait near the site of the collapse for news of missing relatives. Their gathering point is a school playing field where bodies retrieved from the ruins are taken for initial identification attempts. The task of identifying is made all the more difficult by the decomposed state of many of the bodies. The recovery effort is expected to continue for several more days. From Boston to Bangladesh: 'My heart hasn't stopped breaking' Blame spread around . The owners of the building and the factories are under police investigation over accusations they ordered workers to enter the premises on the day of the collapse despite cracks appearing in the structure the day before. Preliminary results of a government inquiry into the building collapse found that ""heavy machinery and high-capacity generators"" were ""largely responsible,"" the state-run Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha News Agency reported last week. ""During the inquiry, we have found that use of substandard materials during the construction also contributed to the building collapse,"" the leader of the inquiry, Main Uddin Khandaker, told BSS. Bangladesh vs. the U.S.: How much does it cost to make a denim shirt? Bangladesh's $20 billion garment industry accounts for 77% of the country's exports. Among those caught up in the finger-pointing after the building collapse disaster are Western retailers and clothing brands that Bangladeshi suppliers say put heavy pressure on prices, resulting in bad pay and conditions for workers. At the weekend, representatives of Bangladesh's government, industry and workers issued a joint statement laying out an ""action plan"" to improve worker safety in the wake of the disaster. The European Union has said it is considering trade action against Bangladesh if it doesn't take clear steps to improve the safety conditions of its millions of garment workers. In November, a fire at Tazreen Fashions Factory, a garment maker in another suburb of Dhaka, killed at least 112 people.

"Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN) -- On any given Monday, Motijheel -- the commercial center of Dhaka -- is a bustling, chaotic mess of rickshaws and cars jockeying for space in overcrowded streets with an equally determined mass of pushing, shoving pedestrians. This Monday was different. Motijheel resembled a battleground, desolate and destroyed. A day earlier, it was. Throughout the day and late into the night Sunday, police and paramilitary troops battled with Islamists who laid siege to the area. Half a million of them, by many accounts. It ended when security forces, 10,000-strong, moved into the area early Monday morning to disperse the protesters. Exactly how many died in the confrontation might never be known. The national news agency, Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS), put the count at 14 dead and more than and more than 75 wounded. Among them were three police officers, a paramilitary trooper and a 12-year-old boy. Police in various cities reported a total of 18 deaths as violence spread. Human rights activists say the final count will be much higher -- one that the government may be loath to share. Photographs that appeared on online blogs and websites show bodies lying on stairwells or cowered in building corners -- bullet wounds to the head or back, or a pool of blood beside them. To avoid a repeat of Sunday's violence, police declared no rallies and gatherings can take place all day Monday in Dhaka. And they escorted the Islamist group's leader out of Dhaka. So protesters focused their efforts elsewhere. In Narayanganj, a city near the capital, Islamists torched vehicles and fought pitched battles with police. In the port city of Chittagong, they clashed with police -- with fatalities reported but not confirmed. How it began . The Islamists are members of the ultra-conservative Hefazat-e-Islami (Protectors of Islam). They gathered Sunday in numbers that boggled the mind. Photos taken from balconies and rooftops showed a sea of bodies dressed in white panjabis and kufis -- both traditional Muslim attire in Bangladesh -- cramming the streets of Motijheel to the hilt. They demanded that the government enact laws that put to death anyone who blasphemed Islam. They called for mandatory Islamic education for all in this secular Muslim nation. They wanted a ban on statues, and the words ""absolute trust and faith in the Almighty Allah"" reinstated in the constitution. They declared that men and women should not be allowed to mix freely in this country of 150 million. And they vowed they would not leave until their demands -- 13 in all -- were met. The ensuing confrontation was violent. And bloody. Country's direction at stake . What is happening in Bangladesh is a push and pull between two forces to determine the future direction of the country. In February, thousands and thousands of youths held a month-long sit-in in another part of the capital, Shahbag, demanding the death penalty for those who took part in war crimes during Bangladesh's bloody battle for independence from Pakistan. Many of those accused of war crimes now hold prominent position in Islamist parties. Are you affected by the protests in Bangladesh? Send us your thoughts and experiences but stay safe. The rallies, led by youths and fueled by social media, also tried to achieve something else: a ban on extreme fundamentalist parties. But Bangladesh is also the fourth most populous Muslim country in the world. And the radical elements of the religion were not going to sit by idly as those rallies grew. The Islamists let their presence known with larger and larger rallies and strikes, first in cities outside Dhaka and then in the capital city. Each time they came out, police officers with batons followed. Clashes ensued. Properties were destroyed. Lives were lost. The Islamists' tactic has been to turn the criticism on its head: By criticizing them, they seemed to say, you criticize Islam. They called the Shahbag participants ""anti-Islamic atheists"" who deserve death for defaming the religion but who are protected by the government. And so, when the Hefazat-e-Islami protesters gathered Sunday, that was one of their main demands: put to death these ""atheists."" Battles for hours . Clashes broke out when Hefazat activists tried to break a police cordon. The street battles went on for hours, with police firing rubber bullets and tear gas and the Islamists hurling crude explosives and chunks of brick. Syed Ashraful Islam, secretary-general of the ruling Awami League and a government minister, said demonstrators set fire to the Communist Party of Bangladesh office and ransacked several other business establishments in central Dhaka. Shahriar Shahid, the managing editor of BSS, said the service had to suspend operations for the day after Hefazat activists set a fire at the entrance of its office. Blame to go around . The government, rights groups say, shares blame not just for its crackdown but also for muffling the free speech of the Islamists. On Monday, authorities shut down the offices of pro-Islamist Diganta Television and Islami TV stations after they aired footage of the clashes. ""They came in early in the morning and ordered us closed,"" staffer Tanvir Hussain told CNN. Information Minister Hasanul Haq Inu told reporters the stations ""provoked violence (by) spreading hatred and rumors."" Last month, the government shut down another opposition newspaper. ""This is what I and many others feared when the Shahbag movement started,"" said Razab Chowdhury, a Bangladeshi expatriate in Fremont, California. ""Does it matter that Hefazat is misguided? Does it matter that their vision of Islam is as twisted as the Taliban's? ""Before, I didn't know about these guys; they were a fringe group that pranced about in Chittagong. Now security has stabilized situation, but I fear it is pushing the country closer to a civil war."" Reminders everywhere . Monday morning, the reminders of the weekend violence were everywhere. Smoke smoldered from rubbish heaps. Fires burned inside ransacked stores. Bricks and rocks littered the streets. Shopkeepers held up pages from copies of Quran burned in shop fires and wailed, ""Those who did this are not Muslims."" Bulldozers pushed the debris to the side. Bangladesh is still reeling from the aftermath of a catastrophic building collapse last month where the death toll continues to mount: more than 650 by Monday. And now this. But Bangladeshis are resilient people. By Monday afternoon, the rickshaws and the cars were back on the streets in Motijheel. So were the street peddlers and the pedestrians. The cars blared their horns, the rickshaws squeezed into every available space. The pedestrians flung profanities. Life, it appeared, was slowly returning to normal. CNN's Saeed Ahmed reported and wrote this story from Atlanta with information provided by journalists Morshed Ali Khan, Farid Ahmed and Sajjad Hussein in Dhaka, Bangladesh.","National news agency BSS puts the count at 14 dead .

"(CNN) -- The horrors of war are best illustrated in the drawings. In one sketch, a child details a helicopter and warplane firing over a tank shooting a missile. Underneath, men fire guns at each other as a stick figure lies on the ground nearby. The Syrian civil war has taken a massive psychological and physical toll on the most innocent of victims -- the children. More than 2 million Syrian children have been afflicted by trauma, malnutrition or disease, the aid group Save the Children said in a report Wednesday. The fighting has left one in three kids with injuries. And it has decimated vaccination programs across the country, with about two-thirds of children in northern Syria without protection against preventable diseases. U.N.: Number of Syrian refugees escalating at rapid rate . Nowhere to hide . With more than 3 million buildings pummeled by attacks, children and parents across the country are running out of places to take cover. About 80,000 Syrians are now sleeping in caves, parks or barns, Save the Children said. Those slightly more fortunate pack into overcrowded apartments or homes with other families. But with the front lines of war shifting daily, no dwelling is spared from the bombings. ""Most of the houses were being hit. We had to stay in one room, all of us. The other rooms were being hit,"" 12-year-old Yasmine told the agency. ""The shelling was constant. ... I knew we could not move from that one room. There were 13 of us... crammed into one room. We did not leave that room for two weeks."" When her father finally ventured out, Yasmine's life changed forever. ""I watched my father leave, and watched as my father was shot outside our home,"" the girl said. ""I started to cry, I was so sad. We were living a normal life, we had enough food. Now, we depend on others. Everything changed for me that day."" Prince Charles visits Syrian refugee camp . Traumatized by grief . Yasmine's ordeal is just one of countless stories of children struggling with the killings of family members. A new study from Bahcesehir University in Turkey found three in every four Syrian children interviewed had lost a loved one because of the fighting, Save the Children said. ""I don't think there is a single child untouched by this war,"" a resident named Safa said. ""Everyone has seen death. Everyone has lost someone."" Used as pawns . They're too young to fight, too young to fire a weapon. But that doesn't mean they've been spared from the front lines. ""Children are increasingly being put directly in harm's way as they are being recruited by armed groups and forces,"" Save the Children said. ""There have even been reports that children as young as eight have been used as human shields."" A recent U.N. report echoes this finding, saying government and rebel forces have recruited boys as young as 12. No school to go to . Ten-year-old Noura said she loved going to school. But like thousands of students, now there is no school to attend. ""I stopped going to school when the shelling started. It wasn't safe,"" Noura told the aid group. ""I feel sad that my school was burned because my school reminds me of my friends."" More than 2,000 schools across the country have been damaged, with many more turned into emergency shelters, the group said. Any way out . Save the Children called for the U.N. Security Council to unite on a plan that will bring an end to the civil war. But two years of U.N. diplomacy, negotiations and chronic stalemates at the Security Council have so far failed to produce an effective solution in Syria. Earlier this year, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad announced a plan to resolve the conflict, which included national dialogue and a new constitution that would be put up for a public referendum. But there's a major caveat: Al-Assad said he refuses to deal with ""terrorists,"" a term the government often uses to describe the opposition seeking to end 42 years of al-Assad family rule. Similarly, opposition members have said they will not work directly with al-Assad's ""criminal"" government, nor will they accept any solution that doesn't involve the president's departure. ""We don't know who is right and who is wrong, but I know we civilians are paying the price,"" a mother named Hiba said. ""I just wanted to keep my children safe. If I die, it is fine ... but not my children.""","Save the Children: Kids as young as 8 are reportedly used as human shields .

"London (CNN) -- The founder of a French company that made breast implants linked to a major health scare has been charged by police investigating the scandal. Jean-Claude Mas, former boss of Poly Implant Protheses (PIP), faces charges of involuntary injury over the now-defunct firm's use of substandard ingredients in its implants. So what is wrong with the implants? What are the risks? And what is being done to help those affected by the scandal? What is the problem? Implants made by France's Poly Implant Protheses (PIP) were banned in 2010, after it was discovered that they contained industrial-grade, which has more contaminants than the medical-grade gel they should have used. Mas is reported to have admitted authorizing the use of two gel formulas at PIP: A high-end version for wealthier clients, using American-made medical silicone, and a ""house"" formula for everyone else. This was made from cheap industrial silicone, meant for use in mattresses, allegedly in order to cut costs and boost profits. In December 2011, authorities in France sparked a worldwide alert when they advised 30,000 French women who had been fitted with the potentially defective implants to have them removed. The implants are believed to have a higher than normal incidence of rupture, though exact figures on this differ: French authorities put the rate at 5%, but in Britain it is thought to be around 1%, in line with industry standards. California plastic surgeon Dr. Grant Stevens told CNN the health risks of industrial-grade silicone remained unclear. ""The PIP industrial silicone has many contaminants,"" he said, but he added: ""We're not sure just how many... We can't be sure what can go wrong. ""We know there's an increased incidence of inflammation; we're not certain of other health risks, but we certainly have concerns about cancer and other toxic exposures."" Authorities in France and Britain have dismissed fears of cancer from the implants but have said that in case of rupture they could cause inflammation, scarring and fibrosis. Where in the world were they used? PIP was once the world's third largest supplier of implants -- 300,000 women in 65 countries around the world are thought to have had them fitted, both for cosmetic reasons and in reconstructive surgery following treatment for breast cancer. The implants were widely used across Europe -- 40,000 women in Britain are affected -- and South America. PIP silicone implants were never licensed for use in the United States. British PIP implant recipient Rowena Mackintosh, told CNN she was worried about the potential impact on her health. ""It's like a ticking time bomb inside me,"" she said. ""When you go to the doctor, you don't say 'who makes your medicine?' -- you just assume it's going to be safe. To think that I've got mattress silicone inside me, and God knows what else they used, it's disgusting."" What advice is being given to women who had the implants fitted? The advice given to women with PIP implants has varied widely from country to country. France has urged all of those with the implants to have them removed immediately as a precaution. In Venezuela, authorities have also recommended the precautionary removal of implants. The British government says there is no evidence to recommend the routine removal of PIP implants, though it says women who are concerned should be able to have them removed. German medical groups have recommended that women seek the removal of their implants, but that there is no immediate danger. Stevens argues that women who have had PIP implants should not wait until they rupture to have them removed. ""Waiting until an MRI is positive is like saying wait to run for cover until after a bomb goes off. If you know something is going to happen, you would try to remove the risk. ""I think it is incumbent on all women, regardless of their government's stance, to recognize that they have a flawed, defective silicone product in their chest, and they have a shell that is containing it that is also flawed -- they need to remove these implants, or remove and replace them."" And what is being done? The French government has offered to pay for the removal and replacement of all PIP implants fitted in France. Venezuela has said it will cover the cost of implant removal, but not their replacement. In the UK, women who had their implants paid for by the National Health Service (NHS) will be able to have them removed free of charge, after consultation with their doctor. The British government says it expects companies that fitted implants privately, for cosmetic purposes, to offer the same deal. Bioethicist Arthur Caplan told CNN it made financial and ethical sense for governments to pre-empt any potential health issues by removing the implants now, rather than waiting to see if they cause problems. ""If these things do turn out to be nasty, and do cause health problems, the bill for that is going to be big, and every government that has a nationalized system is going to pay, so it may be smarter, just on prudential grounds, to take them out now, avoiding what could be a huge financial disaster down the line. ""On the whole, I think it makes more sense, ethically and in terms of economic risk, to get these things out at public expense."" What is the company's response? PIP went bankrupt in 2010, after its implants were banned. Its founder, Mas, is under investigation by French police. On Thursday, he was charged with involuntary injury over the implants. But PIP's lawyer, Yves Haddad, told CNN that while industrial silicone was used in its implants, no tests had shown them to be a danger -- instead he insisted the problem was fear. ""Several things have heightened this fear: The advice and care given to victims, doctors who didn't want responsibility and pushed the problem onto PIP, and the intense media pressure."" Haddad also says there is no money for compensation for victims. ""Unfortunately the company has already been liquidated. No one can expect any money to come from PIP."" Will the scandal have a lasting impact? Concerns over PIP implants have led some to call for greater regulation of the plastic surgery industry. ""If it's going in your body, if it's a pill, if it's a medical device, it should be regulated by the government,"" said Caplan. ""The consumer can't tell what's safe, what isn't safe, what's made according to good manufacturing processes. ""I think you have to have government watching over anything that people put into their bodies for a medical or a health purpose -- I don't buy the idea that it's just buyer beware."" The bioethicist said the scandal also showed the need for plastic surgery charges to include insurance against problems that may arise in future. ""For elective procedures... it would make sense to make part of the charge some kind of coverage or insurance if things go wrong, if there turn out to be adverse events,"" Caplan told CNN. ""National health systems don't want to pay for purely elective cosmetic procedures, so you're going to be stuck if something does turn out to be fraudulent or just misused, and instead of turning to lawyers, it might make better sense to build some insurance into the system.""","Breast implants made by French company PIP found to contain industrial-grade silicone .

"(CNN) -- Turkey's prime minister, a staunch critic of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime, on Tuesday called Israel's recent airstrikes in Syria ""unacceptable."" Recep Tayyip Erdogan made the statement in the capital, Ankara, during a Justice and Development Party group meeting in parliament. ""The air attack by Israel on Damascus is unacceptable. No rationale, no reason can excuse this operation. These attacks are a bargaining chip, an opportunity delivered on a silver platter to the hands of Assad, to the illegitimate Syrian regime,"" he said. The heightened tensions come amid questions about the possible use of chemical weapons in Syria and international debate over how to respond to the country's bloody civil war, in which more than 70,000 people have died in more than two years of fighting. In the latest unrest, U.N. peacekeepers have been seized in Syria near the Israeli-held Golan Heights, a U.N. spokesman said Tuesday. The four were on patrol near al Jamlah, Syria, when an armed group detained them. Officials were working ""to secure their safe release,"" the spokesman said. The Yarmouk Martyrs Brigade, part of the rebel Free Syrian Army, said the peacekeepers were caught in the crossfire between Syrian armed forces and FSA fighters. That prompted the brigade to extract the peacekeepers for their security, the brigade command said. The peacekeepers, all members of a Philippine battalion of the U.N. Disengagement Observer Force, were seized near al Jamlah, in an area that's technically part of the Syrian Golan. After the 1973 war, the force was established to supervise a cease-fire and disengagement agreement. As for Israel, it conducted strikes against Syria twice in recent days, a U.S. official confirmed Monday. One targeted a weapons storage site containing missiles and another was directed at a Damascus research facility, the official said. The official stressed that Israel is concerned about Syria transferring weapons to the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. The strikes killed 42 Syrian soldiers, the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Monday, citing medical sources. It said 100 people remained missing. An Israeli general who commands forces on the Syrian border said ""there are no winds of war,"" according to the Israel Defense Forces website. But the Syrian government warned that Sunday's apparent strikes, which followed one last week that Syria also blames on Israel, open ""the door wide for all the possibilities."" And Syrian ally Iran warned of a ""crushing response,"" while Russia called reports of Israeli involvement ""very worrying."" READ MORE: Q&A: Is Syrian war escalating to wider conflict? Israel focused on Hezbollah weapons transfers . While Israel has not acknowledged responsibility for the attacks, the country has long said it would target any transfer of weapons to Hezbollah or other terrorist groups. ""We are watching everything when it comes to the movement of these types of weapons. We have the means to do that,"" a senior Israeli defense official told CNN's Sara Sidner on Sunday. The official is not authorized to speak to the media. Shaul Mofaz, a lawmaker in Israel's Knesset, told Israeli Army Radio on Sunday that Israel isn't meddling with Syria's civil war. But Israel must protect itself from Lebanese militants, he said. ""For Israel, it is very important that the front group for Iran, which is in Lebanon, needs to be stopped,"" Mofaz said. Tensions in Syria have been worsened by conflicting reports on the possible use of chemical weapons there. On Monday, a U.N. official said evidence points to the use of the deadly nerve agent sarin by Syrian rebel forces. Opinion: Al Qaeda's track record with chemical weapons . Carla Del Ponte told an Italian-Swiss TV station that the findings come after interviews with doctors and Syrian victims now in neighboring countries. Del Ponte, the commissioner of the U.N. Independent International Commission of Inquiry for Syria, said the notion isn't surprising, given the infiltration of foreign fighters into the Syrian opposition. Later, the commission issued a news release saying it ""has not reached conclusive findings as to the use of chemical weapons in Syria by any parties to the conflict."" Therefore, ""the commission is not in a position to further comment on the allegations at this time,"" the statement said. The claim of rebels using sarin gas comes after months of suspicions that the Syrian regime has used the same nerve agent against rebels. Last week, the United States said its intelligence analysts had concluded ""with varying degrees of confidence"" that chemical weapons had been used in Syria and that the Assad regime was the likely culprit. In April, the head of the Israeli military's intelligence research said the Syrian government is using chemical weapons against rebel forces. President Obama said ""intelligence assessments alone are not sufficient"" in guiding its assessments on chemical weapon use in Syria. ""We are working through other means to try to build on the evidence that we already have of chemical weapons use to assert in a concrete and firm way the chain of custody, when chemical weapons were used, by whom, and the full consequences of that use,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said Monday. READ MORE: 42 Syrian soldiers dead in reported Israeli strike, opposition group says . Amid violence, Syrian Internet connections go down . At least 128 people were killed in violence across the country on Tuesday, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria reported. Amid the reported violence, Internet connections across Syria went down Tuesday night, according to several global monitoring sites. Google reported that its services became inaccessible in Syria around 9:45 p.m. (2:45 p.m. ET). The Renesys, Akamai and BGPmon Internet tracking companies also reported the loss of Syrian Internet connectivity at that time. Opposition activists reported widespread power and Internet outages in Damascus and throughout the country, warning that the communications cutoff could be an ominous sign. A regional conflict . The conflict in Syria, which began in March 2011 when the regime cracked down on peaceful protesters, has morphed into a civil war with sectarian overtones. The war has pitted rebel fighters against the Assad regime, a government dominated by the minority Alawites, who represent an offshoot of Shiite Islam. Sunnis, who make up a majority of the Syrian population, are dominant in the opposition. Syria is believed to be the main conduit to the Shiite militia Hezbollah in Lebanon, the proxy through which Iran, a predominantly Shiite nation, can threaten Israel with an arsenal of short-range missiles. In 2009, the top U.S. diplomat in Damascus disclosed that Syria had begun delivery of ballistic missiles to Hezbollah, according to official cables leaked to and published by WikiLeaks. The last thing Iran wants is a Sunni-dominated Syria -- especially as the Syrian rebels' main supporters are Iran's Persian Gulf rivals: Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Hezbollah's feared scenario is Israel on one side and a hostile Sunni-led Syria on the other. Kerry talks about Syria in Russia . U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday he hopes Russia and the United States can find ""common ground"" on Syria. Kerry was in Russia for talks. Moscow and Washington have had profound differences over how to address the crisis. Russia, a longtime friend of Syria, has supported the regime during the conflict. The United States wants al-Assad to step aside. ""We really believe, the United States believes, that we share some very significant common interests with respect to Syria -- stability in the region, not having extremists creating problems throughout the region and elsewhere -- and I think we have both embraced in the Geneva communique a common approach. So it's my hope that today we'll be able to dig into that a little bit and see if we can find the common ground,"" Kerry said, according to a draft transcript of a meeting released by the State Department. The Geneva plan was proposed last year for negotiations between members of the opposition and the Syrian regime. The United States, Russia, and European and Middle Eastern nations have signed on to the plan. READ MORE: Analyst: Syrian hostilities bring Middle East catastrophe closer .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The news that Alex Ferguson is stepping down as Manchester United manager after 26 trophy-laden seasons will be reverberating far beyond British shores Wednesday, and no more so than in Asia where the club has a huge following. To put this in perspective, a study recently commissioned by the newly-crowned English Premier League champions showed that the team's global fan base had doubled to 659 million people between 2007 and 2012 -- with 325 million fans from Asia alone. The figures are staggering, though the number of Manchester United shirts -- official merchandise or not -- that can be seen around the streets of any major city in the region, from Bangkok to Shanghai, goes some way towards illustrating this phenomenal interest. Social interest . And the interest goes beyond simply wearing a replica shirt. Within minutes of the shock announcement, football fans in China flocked to Weibo, the country's version of Twitter, to lament Ferguson's departure. ""Farewell Fergie,"" posted one netizen, known as @HuxuanzheChuckHoo. ""Sir Alex Forever!"" declared @Yesmanduomehao. Another, known as @Drshankui, said: ""Although I don't really like Manchester and their red polo shirts, I have to say Ferguson is one of the most respected coaches. Now that he's going to retire soon, I felt really sad. I want to thank him for bringing all the splendidness to the team!"" Wednesday's news also found its way into the mainstream media in China, including 163.com, one of the country's most popular news platforms. Lucrative . United has not been slow to recognize the benefits of this global appeal, regularly taking part in lucrative pre-season tours at packed venues across Asia to connect with local fans. In July, the team will visit Hong Kong, Thailand, Japan and Australia. The club has also signed a number of sponsorship deals with ""Asian partners,"" including banks in Vietnam and a Japanese social gaming company -- though this Asian ""sweet spot"" has also been clear in the minds of sponsors beyond the region. ""We've gone from no brand awareness in countries like Japan and South Korea to incredible brand awareness,"" Phil Clement, chief marketing officer at Aon, told the Financial Times when explaining the U.S. insurance giant's decision to put pen to paper on a $23 million sponsorship deal earlier this year. United even explored the idea of an Asian stock market floatation in either Hong Kong or Singapore last year, as it eyed investors -- though market volatility at the time put these plans on hold. Winning habit . So why is the club so popular in Asia? The reason is fairly straightforward, according to James Porteous, a sports journalist at the South China Morning Post in Hong Kong. ""The one thing Asian football fans value above anything else is winning, and under Alex Ferguson, Manchester United have simply been one of the most successful clubs in the world. Liverpool have a big following in Asia because of their great history, but that's taken a dent given their recent trophy-starved years. ""While newer champions such as Chelsea and Manchester City have been on the rise, United have had a consistent record of success under Ferguson, gaining new fans in Asia with every trophy won over the last two decades. ""United's history also gives them great glamor and prestige, from the great names of the 1960s and the tragedy of the Busby Babes, and that is also attractive to fans in the region. But most of their popularity is down to their triumphs in the last 20 years under Ferguson. Title after title, the Champions League twice, global megastars such as Eric Cantona, David Beckham, Cristiano Ronaldo ... all these ingredients have made United's football brand Asia's best-loved."" United has also invested wisely in talented Asian players, most recently signing Japan's brightest talent, Shinji Kagawa. The attacking midfielder follows in the footsteps of South Korean star Park Ji-Sung, who spent seven hugely successful years at the club. The result is United's appeal borders on the fanatical at times. When the club announced plans to play in Hong Kong this year, its first visit to the city since 2005, tickets for the friendly against a local club sold out almost instantly. Porteous said former United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel was mobbed by fans when he arrived at Hong Kong airport to promote the game, and again by local journalists at a press conference -- despite leaving the club in 1999. ""The reception I've had in only a couple of hours is incredible,"" Schmeichel told journalists at the time. ""No doubt the club's vast marketing arm will have many plans to maintain this popularity in Asia,"" said Porteous. ""But the key factor is simple: whoever the new manager is, he'll have to keep winning trophies.""

"(CNN) -- What Syria asserts is Israel's launch of two air strikes on Damascus last week presents a marked and dangerous escalation of that country's involvement in the Syrian war. Israel's intervention -- if confirmed -- also shows how the conflict has mutated from a political uprising to an internal armed struggle, and now to a regional war by proxy fiercely fought on Syria's killing fields. (Israel has a policy of refusing to confirm or deny attacks attributed to its military.) The confrontation in Syria has become more complex, more perilous, and more difficult to resolve. The Syrian struggle has not only spread into Syria's neighbors, like Lebanon, Iraq, Jordan and Turkey -- but has also become a battlefield wherein Israel and Iran are challenging each other. There is also a fierce geostrategic rivalry unfolding in Syria between Sunni-dominant Saudi Arabia and Shiite Iran, a rivalry invested and fuelled with sectarianism. A real danger exists that this complex conflict in Syria could escalate into a region-wide battle involving Syria's major allies -- Iran and Hezbollah, and Israel, other regional powers, and the Western states. Israel's alleged deepening involvement in the conflict also changes the dynamics of the political struggle in Syria in two ways. It puts the armed opposition on the defensive, because it shows them that they and Israel are indirectly battling the same enemy -- the Assad regime. And it reinforces President Bashar al-Assad's dominant narrative: that the struggle in Syria is not internal, that this is not about a domestic coalition striving to replace authoritarianism with democracy -- but rather this is a wider conspiracy spearheaded by Israel and its regional allies and Western powers. The Syrian official media has already portrayed Israel's bombings as an attempt to shore up the armed opposition and reverse the balance of power in its favor. Although the Iranian leadership has repeatedly stated that it would come to the aid of Syria if it is attacked by Israel, it is unlikely that Iran or its partner Hezbollah would retaliate directly against Israel's possible strikes. Both Iran and Hezbollah would like to avoid a regional conflict in which Israel and its allies would have the upper hand. Opinion: Is Obama failing on moral leadership? What Iran and Hezbollah would most likely do is deepen their involvement in Syria's shifting sands. In an emotional speech last week, Hassan Nasrallah, the Hezbollah top leader, stressed that al-Assad's allies will not allow Syria to fall. Now Hezbollah and Iran would become more determined than ever to prevent the removal of al-Assad from power. Bluntly put, the recent escalation of hostilities will not only prolong the deadly conflict in Syria, but has now made it an open-ended war by proxy -- one with major potential repercussions for regional and international security and peace. Israel's major goal appears to be the establishment of a red line in Syria, whereby no advanced weapons reach Hezbollah -- its archenemy in Lebanon. Israel's primary audience was Hezbollah and Iran. Israel is taking a calculated gamble that neither Syria nor Hezbollah would risk retaliation. Obama: 'Do not foresee scenario' of American boots on ground in Syria . There is a risk of miscalculation that could trigger a bigger clash. Given the risks and the dangers of a region-wide conflict, one would hope that the great powers -- particularly the United States and Russia -- would assume their historic responsibility and reach an understanding that begins the process of putting an end to the deadly struggle in Syria that has killed more than 70,000 Syrians, according to the latest United Nations estimate, and caused a humanitarian disaster. More than two years after the breakout of the Syrian confrontation there does not seem to be a military solution. It is a long war of attrition with no end in sight. Neither internal camp seems to have the means to deliver a decisive blow. Only a political solution will put an end to the shedding of Syrian blood and prevent the unthinkable: a region-wide conflict that would have catastrophic consequences. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Fawaz A. Gerges.","Gerges: Israel's alleged involvement changes the dynamics of Syrian struggle .

"(CNN) -- Washington was billed as the national testing ground on the issue of genetically modified foods, which draws spirited supporters and detractors into the debate over their effects on human health and the environment. If the state's vote tally is to be believed, it appears the Evergreen State won't get special labeling for GMO foods, as expected before the Tuesday vote. Those in favor of the initiative, however, say don't count your genetically engineered chickens before they hatch, according to a news release that reads rather victoriously, considering the Washington secretary of state's office says the measure failed 55% to 45%. ""The campaign remains confident that a majority of Washington voters support labeling of genetically engineered foods, and optimistic about supporters getting out to vote in this off-year election,"" said the Yes on Initiative 522 release. ""For now, the votes are too close to call,"" reads the Yes on I-522 landing page. ""Over the next few days more ballots will be counted and we will keep you posted as we learn more."" The secretary of state's website says 100% of the vote has been counted. The vote, if confirmed, would mark a defeat for those who say GMO foods may pose health risks and lead to a spike in herbicide and pesticide usage. The Elway Poll in October reported that Washington voters were in favor of the initiative by four percentage points. The vote would have made Washington the third state to require GMO labeling and the first to pass an initiative that will go into effect regardless of whether other states enact similar laws. Placed on the ballot after Washington voters submitted more than 350,000 signatures, I-522 ""would require most raw agricultural commodities, processed foods, and seeds and seed stocks, if produced using genetic engineering as defined, to be labeled as genetically engineered when offered for retail sale."" Yes on I-522 says it is ""motivated by a very simple principle: People have the right to know what's in the food they eat and feed their families."" Sixty-four countries have passed laws allowing consumers to know when there are GMO ingredients in their food, according to the Center for Food Safety. The watchdog group says the ""limited data"" on GMO foods indicates that the foods lead to higher risks of ""toxicity, allergenicity, antibiotic resistance and immune suppression."" Since genetically engineered foods entered the U.S. market, herbicide use on corn, soybeans and cotton has increased by 527 million pounds, the center said, citing a study by Environmental Science Europe. Monsanto, a Missouri-based agricultural giant that was staunchly opposed to the measure, says on its website, GMOanswers.com, that the crops have led to lower pesticide usage. The company says it's also invested more than $100 million to ensure the products are safe. ""Humans, over our history, have altered all of our crops, often for taste or yield or disease resistance,"" the website says. ""Before they reach the market, crops from GM seeds are studied extensively to make sure they are safe for people, animals and the environment,"" the Monsanto site adds. ""Today's GM products are the most researched and tested agricultural products in history."" Opponents spent more than $22 million to fight the legislation -- more than triple what those in favor of labeling spent -- with only $600 of that money coming from within the state. Monsanto contributed more than $5 million, the Washington Public Disclosure Commission said. Twenty-three states have pending legislation regarding GMO labeling, according to the group Right to Know GMO. Maine and Connecticut in June passed laws requiring labeling, but they won't go into effect until other states pass GMO-labeling laws. California last year shot down such a law with 51.4% of voters casting ballots against it. The U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service approved a non-GMO label for meat and liquid egg products in June, the first time the department has approved such a label from a third party. GMO foods were approved for human consumption in 1995, but the Food and Drug Administration never required any labels pointing them out as such. Follow Eliott C. McLaughlin on Twitter: @CNNWriters .

"(CNN) -- Eleven people were killed in Afghanistan Wednesday when an anti-Pakistan demonstration turned violent, a spokesman for the provincial governor of Kandahar said. Hundreds of residents of Maiwand District in Kandahar province staged the rally, spokesman Javid Faisal said. Most of the protesters were chanting against Pakistan, he said. The demonstration turned violent when an armed group began protesting against the Afghan government and foreign and Afghan forces, Faisal said. Gunfire broke out between police and the armed group, leaving eight of its members dead as well as three civilian motorists. Ten people were injured and 30 suspects were arrested, Faisal said. Police also seized a vest made for a suicide bomber and a motorcycle primed with explosives, he said. Initial investigations show the armed group came from the Pakistani side of the border, he said. The clash comes against a backdrop of renewed tensions on the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan.

"Washington (CNN) -- While the Senate passed legislation barring workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity with a significant bipartisan vote on Thursday, the bill faces major hurdles to even start moving through the GOP-led House, and there's almost no chance it will come up for a vote this year. House Speaker John Boehner opposes the Employment Non Discrimination Act, known as ENDA, and believes protections for employees already exist under other laws. Senate passes LGBT anti-discrimination bill . ""The Speaker believes this legislation will increase frivolous litigation and cost American jobs, especially small business jobs,"" Boehner spokesman Michael Steel said this week. And Rory Cooper, spokesman for House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, told CNN ""the bill is currently not scheduled"" for consideration. Instead, Cooper insisted the Senate should be doing other work. ""I hope (Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid) soon addresses the dozens of House-passed bills that have been ignored in the Senate that create jobs, improve education and create opportunity while Americans struggle to find a good-paying job."" But Rep. Richard Hanna of New York, one of the five GOP co-sponsors of the House version ENDA, pointed to his party's loss in the Virginia governor's race on Tuesday as a reason why the House needs to consider the measure. ""Certainly what we see in Virginia is a difficulty with women and minorities and that's something the party needs to reconcile and look broadly and think about,"" Hanna told CNN on Thursday. Hanna's message to the GOP was ""we need to understand that standing on our own principles is part of this, but the world is a pluralistic place and we represent a broad cross section of Americans of different races, generations, sexual orientations, and everyone has rights."" Sutter: It's 'way past time' for gay rights law . The Republican National Committee found after last year's loss in the presidential election that younger Americans, who voted disproportionately for Barack Obama, weigh their support for a political party based on its tolerance and inclusiveness, including on the issue of gay rights. 10 Republican Senators vote with Dems . Advocates of ENDA also point to national polls that show a majority of Republicans now support legislation protects gays and lesbians from job discrimination. On Thursday 10 GOP senators joined with Senate Democrats to pass the measure. Several senior House Republican congressional aides acknowledge the political climate has shifted some since the House last considered ENDA in 2007, but they also believe most House GOP members would oppose it now. They say members aren't hearing much about it from their constituents, so there's little pressure to vote on it this year. Pennsylvania Rep. Charlie Dent, a five-term Republican whose district has been targeted regularly by Democrats, is another Republican who is pushing for a House vote. Dent told CNN the party's loss to Obama is a key reason why it should get behind the bill. ""I do believe that we have to learn some lessons from the 2012 election, and to me this is one of them. This legislation, ENDA, is one way to reach out to the LGBT community in a way that is fair and reasonable and speaks to our shared values. I think we all agree we should not tolerate this type of discrimination in any form,"" Dent said. Sexual orientation and ENDA: How we got here . Dent also said passing the measure ""would be an upside to the party, particularly with young voters."" Outside advocacy groups spent the past year targeting states with GOP Senators to secure votes to pass the bill in the Senate. Little pressure on House GOP . But House districts were redrawn in 2010 to make them more solidly red or blue so there are fewer ""swing"" districts like those Dent and Hanna represent, reducing leverage for supporters. ""As far as specific House races are concerned, I can't see it being a main issue,"" one of the House GOP sources said in predicting that the issue ""will kind of fade by Friday"" without any real push by members for a vote. Even gay rights advocates who sought to pressure GOP Senators aren't sugar coating prospects in the House. ""It's an uphill climb. It's Mount Kilimanjaro,"" Fred Sainz, vice president of communications at the Human Rights Campaign, told CNN. The House Education and the Workforce Committee, which has jurisdiction over the issue, has yet to announce a hearing on the bill, and doesn't plan any action on ENDA at this point, according to a spokeswoman for the panel. One place where a House Republican could face blowback for lack of action is in upstate New York. Second-term GOP Rep. Chris Gibson is running against an openly gay Democratic candidate, Sean Eldridge, who has worked as an advocate for same-sex marriage. Gibson recently signed on as a co-sponsor of the House ENDA bill. Obamacare still a focus . But GOP aides believe that highlighting problems with the online rollout of Obamacare and focusing on economic issues should remain their top priorities, and say there is little pressure from GOP rank and file to move ENDA, because they largely oppose the bill. Supporters believe the 2007 House vote, when 35 House Republicans backed the legislation, could be a marker of how many GOP members could vote for the bill now. But of that group only a dozen still serve in the House. Among those who supported that measure was 2012 GOP vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin. But that version of ENDA was drafted more narrowly and Ryan's spokesman says the Congressman is opposed to the Senate bill at this point. ""Congressman Ryan does not believe someone should be fired because of their sexual orientation. That said, any legislation to address this concern should be narrowly crafted to guard against unintended consequences,"" Kevin Seifert told CNN. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said Boehner's move to avoid a vote is part of a pattern, criticizing his decision to spend money backing a court challenge to uphold a ban on same-sex marriage, which the Supreme Court overruled. Fighting a losing battle in the House . Democrats might try to force a vote through a procedural maneuver but know it probably won't happen. Sainz told CNN the effort to pass the bill will take some time, but the Human Rights Campaign is working to get at least 25 of the 35 House Republicans they believe would vote for the bill to publicly endorse it. He said ENDA should fit into the House Republican's economic agenda since it promotes employees keeping their jobs. Supporters are also looking for other ways to get it to the House floor. One option is attaching the measure to next year's defense authorization bill in the Senate and sending that to the House. By tucking the measure into a must-pass bill that House Republicans support, any effort to oppose ENDA would mean adopting an amendment to strip it out. Advocates believe they could muster the votes to block that. This strategy was used to move another contentious issue involving gay rights -- the repeal of the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy barring service in the military. Dent believes outside advocates need to do some legwork to educate House Republicans, many of whom didn't serve in Congress the last time the issue came up for a vote. But he notes this session of Congress doesn't wrap up until the end of 2014 so ""they'll be time over the next 14 to 15 months to make progress in the House."" Sainz said he is prepared for the challenge and predicts the same constituents who moved the Senate to act will do the same in the House. ""There are gay people in every single member of Congress' district who we will mobilize,"" he said.","Senate passes Employment Non Discrimination Act with help of 10 Republicans .

It is Friday in downtown Cairo, and people are shouting and screaming across the square, waving signs and chanting in unison. A fever for change pulses through the land of the Pharaohs. It is weeks after the revolution -- yet the fever here still has not broken. Nearly every Friday across much of Egypt, crowds take to the streets, their passion and push for change still visible. Seif, a soft-spoken, petite brunette with big brown eyes, is on the lookout for human rights abuses or beatings of protesters -- her specialty and personal crusade. Before the day is over, she will send dozens of tweets, post online pictures and video, and record her observations and interviews with people in the streets. And this is not even her day job. Seif is a cancer research lab worker. But she is also a blogger and internet activist, one of Egypt's many prominent internet revolutionaries who helped topple former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in February. Though their revolution is officially over, they consider the fight ongoing and any sort of real democracy but a far-off dream. They continue to tweet and upload photos and live-streaming video for all the world to see. A similar network of online bloggers and activists stretches across the entire Middle East and North Africa, from Yemen in the east to Morocco in the west, many of them friends and in constant contact with one another. Mostly in their mid-20s, the young i-revolutionaries have various motivations and backgrounds. For Seif, the mission is personal and, in many ways, an inherited mantle. She comes from a well-known and respected family of Egyptian human rights activists, dissidents and protesters who have helped shape her view of the world and prepare her and her siblings to take a place on the front lines of Egypt's revolution, using the latest technological and digital weapons. She was born into the fight, literally. On the day of her birth, her father was in prison because of his activism. Ahmed Seif El-Islam Hamad is an internationally known human rights attorney in Cairo who was arrested in 1983 and held five years for his work with the country's socialist movement. During his detention, he was tortured, which he has spoken about publicly. After his release, he dedicated himself to fighting torture and injustice, becoming central to some of Egypt's most celebrated human rights cases. A decade after he was freed, Ahmed Seif helped found one of Egypt's top human rights centers. Much of his work at the Hisham Mubarak Law Centre has put him in direct conflict with the Mubarak regime. Mona Seif's mother, Laila Soueif, is a math professor at Cairo University who helped organize many of the country's most important demonstrations against the Mubarak regime during the last two decades. At the height of the last big pro-democracy push, known in part for the ""Kefayah"" movement in 2005, Soueif was among a group of women assaulted by Mubarak thugs on the streets. In that attack, Mona's older brother, Alaa, protected his mother by repelling blows with his arm, which was broken in the attack. Soueif is widely known on the streets as brash and courageous, and has on numerous occasions faced down baton-wielding policemen with nothing but her scolding, scathing, booming voice and steely eyes. ""She is unbelievable,"" Mona said of her mother. ""The joke with all of our friends is, if you see Laila Soueif in a protest, then you stick to her and you will be safe."" ""People always assume, (because) she is a woman and she has white hair, so they want to protect her. But really she doesn't fear anything. She never fears state security. I have one photo of her in a protest where she is literally pushing against this line of state security policemen. She's amazing in this sense."" With their parents so involved in politics and dissent, Mona and her siblings grew up hearing about torture, repression, injustice and the law. The Mubarak dictatorship and police brutality were typical subjects of dinner-table conversation. Seif's oldest brother, Alaa Abd El Fattah, is a computer programmer who has become one of the most widely known internet revolutionaries in Egypt. He and his wife, Manal, created the Egyptian blog aggregator site Manalaa. Shortly after the incident with his mother in 2005, Alaa's insightful, analytical blogs, in which he documented and analyzed the growing abuses by the Mubarak regime, captured attention. As his voice grew, Alaa, too, became a threat to the regime. He was arrested at a demonstration in 2006 and imprisoned for some 45 days. Mona and Manal helped organize a successful worldwide online campaign to free Alaa. Upon his release, he and his wife moved to South Africa, where they continue their campaigns and criticism. Mona's younger sister, Sanaa, is also already involved in helping organize rallies and groups of young activists. Mona, the middle child, always knew this was her path. ""I've always known I'll be politically active. It's sort of, I don't know, part of my heritage I guess,"" she said. ""But I needed to find my own space,"" a way to make her own mark. ""Using Twitter, using social networks, and with my phone, working on cases of military detentions, tribunals and torture -- this has become my own space. I've found my own way of being part of all of this now."" In 2010, as events began to heat up, leading to the revolution, Mona began regularly attending demonstrations and working to help the cause. ""I actually celebrated my 25th birthday at a demonstration, in front of the ministry of prosecution. My friends were all there and it was very funny."" During the revolution, between January 25 and February 5, when President Mubarak finally stepped down, Mona's entire family was together in the square, night and day. Aunts and uncles and cousins came from afar -- one from London -- to join them. ""We actually had our first family reunion in a long time in Tahrir Square, during the revolution,"" Mona said. Facing down the Mubarak regime is something she will never forget. ""It was a life-changing moment for most of the people in Tahrir Square. You could see the gunshots at people, and you could see how people were just going to face the thugs that were attacking us, with nothing to protect themselves. ... ""This was the important moment when everyone realized that everyone in Tahrir Square is willing to take this to the end, no matter what. From that moment on, for me and a lot of others, we had this blind faith that we really will win in the end."" Today, Mona's main political focus is on individuals who have been detained by the military and are denied due process or fair representation. Many detainees have been held with virtually no legal representation, she said, and many of the trials of protesters by the military have been conducted en masse. ""We have evidence that the military right now is targeting protesters. ... They selected known figures of the Tahrir protest. They selected people who were known and they tortured and beat them up,"" she said. ""And if you read or listen to the testimonies of those who were released, which are a few, we still have a lot of people detained unconstitutionally. And you see that it's not just that they're getting tortured or beaten up, but there's an element of the Army trying to break the revolutionary spirit."" CNN's request for an interview with the Egyptian military leaders was denied. CNN was instead given a statement denying these allegations. ""These cases of torture are false rumors. None of these accounts are true. We are in unstable times in Egypt. There are thugs loose,"" said the statement from the Egyptian military spokesman. Mona Seif said the military used different tactics against male revolutionaries than they did the women. ""For the guys, they said the officer told them that they won't stop beating them up until they say 'Long live Mubarak.' In another testimony, they told them to raise their hands up high, and when they would do this they would get beat, kicked in their faces and their heads. ... ""And for the girls, they line them up and ask them who is a virgin and who is not, and whoever says she's a virgin, they got someone, an officer wearing a white coat, so they assume he's a doctor, to check whether they are virgins or not with the threat that those who lied about their virginity would probably face prostitution charges. ... You could see it was just to break their spirit. Because in Egypt, in this culture, nothing would break their spirits far more than this."" The Army has admitted they did the virginity tests, saying it was a way to prevent women from making false claims of rape while they were in prison. Mona works closely with many other online activists, including her friends Gigi Ibrahim and Ramy Raoof. They say the number of those who have been denied justice is not small. ""When we started following some of the cases of the protesters, we realized that since January 28 there are thousands of Egyptian citizens who have gone through this. ... They try at least 100 people per one trial. They don't care about investigations; they don't care about the presence of a lawyer. So far we have 500 names of people who were tried before a military court."" The detainees who get released are asked to record what happened to them. ""They write it down. Some of them we managed to get their video testimonies right after they were released, so it actually shows bruises and burn marks."" The testimonies are now online, as a common blog, called the Tahrir Diaries. ""Especially with the army violations and the army torture cases,"" she said, ""the Internet is really our only means of fighting this.""

"(CNN) -- After sparking controversy to have designer John Galliano teach a three-day master class at Parsons The New School for Design, the school announced on Wednesday the class has been canceled. ""An important element of the planned workshop with John Galliano was a candid conversation about the connection between his professional work and his actions in the world at large,"" said Parsons in a statement. ""Unfortunately, we could not reach consensus with Mr. Galliano on the conditions of this conversation, and the program could not move forward."" The former chief designer for Christian Dior is not new to controversy. In 2011, he was fired and convicted of making anti-Semitic comments. In a previous statement, Parsons said the class was expected to give students an opportunity to learn from ""an immensely talented designer."" Soon after the class was announced, a petition was created on Change.org against Galliano teaching at Parsons and generated more than 2,100 supporters. Galliano was fired from the fashion giant in March 2011 after making anti-Semitic remarks in Paris. Later that year, a French court found him guilty for making public insults based on origin, religious affiliation, race or ethnicity. ""I love Hitler,"" Galliano said in a video obtained by Britain's Sun newspaper. ""Your mother, your forefathers would be f---ing gassed and f---ing dead."" In his trial, he said that alcohol and drugs were major factors, which he realized during a stint in rehab after he was fired. Galliano apologized, saying, ""Anti-Semitism and racism have no part in our society."" He added: ""I only have myself to blame, and I know that I must face up to my own failures and that I must work hard to gain people's understanding and compassion."" Abraham Foxman, national director for the Anti-Defamation League, said Tuesday in a statement, ""I think it's time that John Galliano be evaluated on his skills."" ""He apologized, he repaired, he reached out. We should just move on. I think that's the fair thing to do. I'm delighted for Parsons, and I'm delighted for him,"" Foxman added. In their earlier statement, Parsons acknowledged the controversy saying, ""We believe that over the past two years, Mr. Galliano has demonstrated a serious intent to make amends for his past actions.""

"(CNN) -- A horse racing trainer who became engulfed in a doping scandal and was banned from the sport for eight years has appealed his sentence, the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) has confirmed. Mahmood Al Zarooni, who worked at the world famous Godolphin stables in the English town of Newmarket, was banned from horse racing after admitting injecting his thoroughbreds with steroids. The 37-year-old admitted a ""catastrophic error"" in administering prohibited anabolic steroids -- ethylestranol and stanozolol -- to 15 leading thoroughbreds. All 15 horses, including the former 1,000 Guineas favorite Certify, were banned from racing for six months by the BHA. The case rocked the sport and led to Godolphin principal Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum -- the ruler of Dubai -- shutting down the stables, saying he was ""appalled and angered"" by the doping revelations. A statement on the BHA's official website read: ""Mahmood Al Zarooni has lodged an appeal against the severity of his eight-year suspension from training. ""Al Zarooni, 37, was found guilty of administering anabolic steroids to 15 horses in his care at a BHA hearing on April 25. ""The former Godolphin handler, who was based at Moulton Paddocks in Newmarket, was officially charged with rule breaches related to prohibited substances, duty to keep medication records, and conduct prejudicial to racing. ""He will now contest the length of the eight-year ban, with the date for the appeal hearing to be confirmed in due course."" Al Zarooni waived his right to legal representation and accepted all the charges at a hearing in London at the end of April. It led to Sheikh Mohammed locking down the paddocks and issuing a statement. In it he said: ""I can assure the racing public that no horse will run from that yard this season until I have been absolutely assured by my team that the entire yard is completely clean."" The 63-year-old Sheikh attended Newmarket racecourse on Saturday to see Godolphin colt Dawn Approach win the English 2000 Guineas. According to AFP, Godolphin said Al Zarooni's appeal was nothing to do with them and was simply a matter between him and the BHA. ""He is no longer a Godolphin employee and the appeal is a matter between himself and the BHA. Godolphin has no involvement with this appeal,"" AFP quoted a Godolphin spokesperson as saying. Soon after Al Zarooni's punishment was confirmed a second trainer in Newmarket revealed he was facing an inquiry on similar offenses. The BHA confirmed Gerard Butler was being investigated after some of his horses tested positive for banned substances at his yard in February. Butler told a British newspaper he was facing a ban after injecting his horses with a product used to treat joints but said he was so sure of its validity he entered it into his official medical records which were then sent to the BHA. He called the incident ""an unpardonable misjudgment"" but said it hadn't crossed his mind there could be a problem with the medication.","Horse racing trainer Mahmood Al Zarooni appeals eight-year ban from sport .

"(CNN) -- When Amanda Berry screamed Monday evening for help through a crack in the front door of the house where she was being held, she set in motion an end to roughly a decade of captivity for herself and two other women. Berry's case had been publicized through the years, and when Georgina DeJesus was reported missing, her case, too, became known to the public. Little has been reported about the case of Michelle Knight. According to Cleveland's MetroHealth Medical Center, all three women were seen in the hospital's emergency room Monday night and had been released as of Tuesday morning. What had happened to them -- physically, emotionally, mentally -- in the years before, though, largely remains a mystery. Here's more information about Berry, DeJesus and Knight and their disappearances: . Amanda Berry . Age: 16 when she was reported missing; now, 27. Missing since: April 21, 2003 . Last seen: walking home from a job at Burger King a few blocks from her home about 7:40 p.m., according to the FBI. It was the eve of her 17th birthday. Clues: She called her sister to tell her she was getting a ride home, CNN affiliate WJW reported. Appearance: The FBI missing person poster described her as 5 feet 1 inch to 5 feet 3 inches tall and weighing 105 pounds. Law enforcement action: The FBI had 10 postings on its website about her disappearance and offered a reward of up to $25,000 for information about her whereabouts. Family reaction: It was a call she'd been waiting a decade for. On one end was Fern Gentry, on the other was her granddaughter Amanda Berry -- whom she'd last seen as a teenager but, as the grandmother told her in that long-awaited phone call, she, ""never forgot."" ""Grandma, I'm fine,"" Berry said, according to a call recorded by CNN affiliate WJHL. On the call, Berry also said that the 6-year-old girl also freed Monday was her own daughter. Relatives in Tennessee, like Gentry, were eager to meet her and reunite with Berry. ""I never thought we'd see this day,"" said Crystal Milton, a cousin of the once-missing girl. Georgina 'Gina' DeJesus . Age: 14 when she was reported missing; now, 23. Missing since: April 2, 2004 . Last seen: at a pay phone around 3 p.m. as she was walking home from school. The girl and a friend had called the friend's mother seeking permission for a sleepover at DeJesus' house, but the answer was no. Appearance: The FBI missing person poster described her as 5 feet 1 inch to 5 feet 3 inches tall and weighing 135 pounds. Law enforcement action: The FBI, which mentions her in eight documents on its website, was offering an unspecified reward for information leading to her recovery. Family reaction: The Cleveland hospital room was crowded -- with about 200 people, not to mention balloons and stuffed animals. And at the center of it all was Gina DeJesus. ""I thought it was a dream,"" Ricardo DeJesus said of his sister being found. ""I'm glad it's reality."" Asked what kind of person his sister had been, he said, ""She liked to dance a lot, crack jokes and be with the family."" Though she is now an adult, he said, he plans to keep a closer eye on Georgina than before. ""I'm gonna sit there and make sure that she gets there and back home, be more protective."" A sister, Mayra DeJesus, said Gina spent Tuesday with her family -- with the focus on her, but not so much what she'd gone through. She described Gina as in ""good spirits."" The long missing woman's aunt, Sandra Ruiz, told reporters that her recovery shows that anything is possible. ""If you don't believe in miracles,"" Ruiz said, ""I suggest you think again, because it does happen."" Michelle Knight . Age: 21 when she was reported missing; now 32, according to the Cleveland Police Department. Missing since: August 22, 2002, said Martin Flask, director of public safety for the police; a missing person report was filed the next day. Clues: Knight's grandmother, Deborah Knight, told The Plain Dealer on Monday that the family had concluded that Michelle had left of her own accord because she was angry that she had lost custody of her son. That conclusion was supported by police and social workers, she told the newspaper. But the missing woman's mother, Barbara Knight, told the newspaper that her daughter would never have broken all contact voluntarily. Barbara Knight moved to Naples, Florida, about a year and a half ago, her neighbor Sheldon Gofberg told CNN. But even after her move, Barbara Knight told The Plain Dealer that she often returned to Cleveland's West Side to search for her daughter, putting up posters seeking information about her. She said she thinks she saw her daughter and an older man walking together at a shopping plaza several years ago, but the woman did not respond when she called Michelle's name. Law enforcement action: The FBI website makes no mention of her.","Amanda Berry tells relatives she's fine, a 6-year-old freed is her daughter .

"(CNN) -- Israel is taking steps to defend itself against threatened retaliation from Syria after claims it launched a night assault on a suburb of the capital Damascus on Sunday. This was believed to be the second Israeli attack in three days. The country positioned rocket interception batteries along its northern border and closed northern airspace to civil aviation after Syria vowed it would ""suffer"" for the alleged airstrikes on what it called a ""scientific research facility."" Israel declined to comment on reported attacks. In an exclusive interview with CNN's Frederick Pleitgen, Syria's Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal al Mekdad called the alleged assault a ""declaration of war."" Meanwhile, condemnation flowed from its allies, including Iran, which said the ""vicious acts"" could ""jeopardize (the) security of the entire region."" What do we know about the extent of Israel's intervention? We know what's being claimed by Syria, and that is that several explosions hit the scientific research center in Jamraya early Sunday, killing 42 Syrian soldiers, the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Monday, citing medical sources. It said 100 people remained missing. Syria's state news agency, Sana, said early information indicated the explosions were caused by Israeli rockets, though Israel has a policy or refusing to comment on attacks attributed to its military. It's not the first time Israel has targeted the site, Sana reported, pointing to an attack on January 30. At the time, a U.S. official told CNN the claim was false, saying that Israeli fighter jets targeted a Syrian government convoy carrying surface-to-air missiles bound for the militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon. Syria denied there were such shipments. Last week, two U.S. officials backed up Syrian claims that Israel had launched airstrikes in the country on Thursday or Friday, taking the total number of potential strikes within Syrian territory to three, including Sunday's alleged attack. On Sunday, the Lebanese Army and UNIFIL -- the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon -- intensified their patrols along Lebanon's border with Israel, according to Lebanon's national news agency. It said the move followed the alleged blasts and ""intensified Israeli Army patrols"" along the ""'Blue Line' within the occupied territories."" United Nations Security-General Ban Ki-Moon has urged all sides to exercise ""maximum calm and restraint."" However, Ban's spokesman said in a statement issued on Sunday that the United Nations could not ""independently verify what has occurred."" Is Israel saying anything? Israel's long-standing policy has been to deny comment on claims of attacks. However, it has previously said that it would target any transfer of weapons to Hezbollah or other terrorist groups, as well as any effort to smuggle Syrian weapons into Lebanon that could threaten Israel. Shaul Mofaz, a lawmaker in Israel's Knesset or parliament, told Israeli Army Radio on Sunday that Israel wasn't meddling in Syria's civil war. But he insisted that Israel must protect itself from Lebanese militants. ""For Israel, it is very important that the front group for Iran, which is in Lebanon, needs to be stopped,"" Mofaz said. ""Hezbollah is deeply involved up to its neck in what is happening in Syria,"" Mofaz said, before adding ""Hezbollah helps the Iranians navigate against the rebels."" How is Hezbollah involved, and what is its connection to Iran? The supply of weapons by Iran to Hezbollah in Lebanon is thought to be at the heart of the issue. Iran has long supported Hezbollah with funding and weapons, which it's alleged are smuggled via Syria to the organization's Lebanese base. After Sunday's strike, Iran's foreign minister phoned his counterpart in Syria and ""praised the resistance by the Syrian government against the enemies' plots."" Hezbollah is a Shiite militant group regarded by Israel and the United States as a terrorist organization, although its political wing is a key player in Lebanon's government. It has been linked to a number of attacks against Israeli, U.S. and other Western targets. In 2006, Israel and Hezbollah fought a month-long war in Lebanon, northern Israel and the Golan Heights which ended with a U.N.-brokered cease-fire. At the time, Israel was said to be surprised by the intensity and weaponry displayed by the Hezbollah forces. Israel says it has intelligence that Hezbollah has long been supported by the Syrian government and Hezbollah has in turn been supporting the Syrian regime throughout the country's civil war. Hezbollah has been accused of sending fighters into Syria to support the Assad regime in the south and south west, but has denied these claims, saying its militants have, only recently, begun defending Lebanese border villages from attack by Syrian rebels. In 2009, the top U.S. diplomat in Damascus disclosed that Syria had begun delivery of ballistic missiles to Hezbollah, according to official cables leaked to and published by WikiLeaks. How real are fears that this could lead to a regional Middle East war? Few sides at this point would logically appreciate a widening of the conflict -- but hopes of resolving it seem as distant as ever. ""The Syrian struggle has not only spread into Syria's neighbors, like Lebanon, Iraq, Jordan and Turkey -- but has also become a battlefield wherein Israel and Iran are challenging each other,"" Fawaz Gerges, professor of international relations at the London School of Economics, wrote in an opinion piece for CNN. ""There is also a fierce geostrategic rivalry unfolding in Syria between Sunni-dominant Saudi Arabia and Shiite Iran, a rivalry invested and fuelled with sectarianism. A real danger exists that this complex conflict in Syria could escalate into a region-wide battle involving Syria's major allies -- Iran and Hezbollah, and Israel, other regional powers, and the Western states."" Analysts say that as part of the Lebanese government the group would be risking a great deal if it responded to Israeli aggression with force. Israeli officials are betting that al-Assad will not retaliate, both because his forces have their hands full already and because any strike against Israel would risk Israeli counterstrikes that might seriously degrade his advantages in the civil war, like airpower. ""They don't want to open a new front that might be the last one they open,"" says one Israeli military official on condition of anonymity. ""They would suffer a knockout punch."" Syria's military is exhausted by the civil war and it would make little sense to open a new front against the best equipped military in the region, unless it was in a last-ditch attempt to garner flagging support as its internal morale vanished. But two years into the Syrian civil war there does not seem to be a military solution. ""It is a long war of attrition with no end in sight,"" wrote Gerges. ""Neither internal camp seems to have the means to deliver a decisive blow. ""Only a political solution will put an end to the shedding of Syrian blood and prevent the unthinkable: a region-wide conflict that would have catastrophic consequences.""

"(CNN) -- ""King"" Alex Ferguson is quitting Manchester United but the football team's $3.17 billion brand will survive, according to experts. Ferguson -- the man who helped propel Manchester United to one of the world's biggest sport brands -- is set to step down at the end of the season after 26 years at the club. The 71-year-old Scot has managed the English club -- which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and has millions of fans around the world -- since 1986. During his 26 years as manager, Ferguson has won more than 30 trophies, including 13 league championships. Watch more: What is Sir Alex's football legacy? And while brand expert Jonathan Gabay believes there will be a period of uncertainty at the club following the exit of a ""living legend,"" the ""Brand Manchester United"" will survive long after his reign. ""The king is dead, but that doesn't mean there will never be a king again,"" Gabay told CNN, ""He [Ferguson] is part of a legendary football brand, but he's not bigger than the actual brand itself."" Watch more: Watch 2012 interview with Ferguson . Andre Spicer, a professor of Organizational Behavior at the Cass Business School in London, said the loss of a ""great leader"" such as Ferguson is similar to ""enduring a death"" for a company. Ferguson's retirement has already sparked a media and fan frenzy of speculation over his successor. Spicer added that fans will idealize the achievements of Ferguson and as such ""it becomes impossible for a successor to fill the old leader's shoes."" Watch more: Manchester United's future after Fergie . The Scot's decision to retire and the appointment of his successor could also have a significant impact on the club financially . Since the first season of the English Premier League in 1992/3 season, Manchester United's revenue has grown from £25.2 million to £320.3 million for the 2011/12 season. ""Manchester United has been transformed as a football club under the management of Sir Alex Ferguson,"" according to Dan Jones, partner in the Sports Business Group at Deloitte. While Andy Milligan, a partner at business consultancy, Caffeine, and author of football business book ""Brand it Like Beckham,"" said that club owners, the Glazers, may go into ""overdrive"" in the next 24 hours to reassure global stakeholders that the club's stability, on the pitch, is not at risk. Milligan said Manchester United's next appointment may be as much about reassuring investors outside the U.K. as it will be for sporting reasons. Milligan told CNN: ""Football is a very volatile market place. But if you add U.S. stock market pressures to football; it could be an explosive mix."" Manchester United's American owners, the Glaziers, listed the soccer club on the New York Stock Exchange in August and its growing commercial success is highly dependent on performances on the pitch, according to Joshua Raymond, a market strategist at London-based financial services firm, CityIndex. ""Replacing Alex Ferguson is a monumental task and one that shareholders will watch with great interest and nervous uncertainty,"" he said in a note on the firm's website. Raymond wrote that the appointment of Real Madrid manager Jose Mourinho would be ""a much safer appointment in the eyes of the United board and shareholders"" while the appointment of Everton manager and bookmakers favorite, David Moyes, would ""come with great risk"" due to his lack of experience with big clubs. In his note, Raymond went on to say that Mourinho would be the only appointment that could increase the club's brand recognition. Manchester United is one of the world's most valuable clubs -- second only to Spanish giants Real Madrid -- according to a study by financial experts, Forbes. In the club's third-quarter results, the English Premier League champions posted record revenue of £91.7 million ($142 million) on the back of new sponsorship deals in Asia and Europe. The club, who have just claimed their 20th league title, reported a 52.2% increase in sponsorship revenue having announced new deals with two financial services providers in Denmark and Vietnam as well as an agreement with a Japanese social gaming company.","Experts: 'King' Alex Ferguson may be going but brand Manchester United will survive .

"(CNN) -- Prince Harry's last visit to the United States, in August 2012, did not end well, after photographs of him romping naked around a Las Vegas hotel suite were published worldwide -- just weeks before he began his tour of duty in Afghanistan. ""I probably let myself down, I let my family down, I let other people down,"" he said in an interview a few weeks later. ""It was probably a classic example of me probably being too much army, and not enough prince."" Harry argued at the time that it happened in a private area and that he should have been able to expect a certain amount of privacy. Expect him to redress the balance then on his next visit to the United States, which begins on Thursday. And he won't be stopping in Las Vegas. His Private Secretary, Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, has reassuringly confirmed that the prince will ""fulfil his duties with his inimitable style in all he does."" He has a point. No-one does royal tours quite like Prince Harry, and he's clearly fond of the United States, visiting several times during the years, both in official and private capacities. This is the prince who dispensed with handshakes when he met Jamaican prime minister Portia Simpson Miller in March 2012 and gave her a hug instead (he said he had heard that she liked hugs.) On the same day he also challenged Olympic multi-medallist Usain Bolt to a race and then went on to impersonate Bob Marley during a state dinner. If there is a Usain Bolt moment in the U.S., it will be on a baseball diamond In New York on Tuesday. But striking a baseball isn't as easy as it looks -- has Harry been practicing? He is competitive and will at least be on more of a level playing field when he captains a polo team during a match in Connecticut on Wednesday. It's a sport he excels at, but such events are as much about socializing -- and Harry's presence is fast turning it into the society event of the year. This is, after all, the man who ultimately has the power to turn women into princesses -- or at least duchesses. But Harry isn't coming to the United States to find a wife, officially at least. Instead, he's carrying out a dual role: representing the interests of his charities and those of the United Kingdom. He's a big asset for the British government, able to attract A-list political, corporate and showbiz guests to receptions at tour stops in Washington, Denver and New York.

"(CNN) -- The lead singer of the metal band As I Lay Dying has been arrested and charged with seeking to have his wife killed, the San Diego County Sheriff's Department said. Authorities said Tuesday that Tim Lambesis tried to contract an undercover detective posing as a killer for hire to murder his estranged wife, who lives in Encinitas, California. Arraignment was set for Thursday afternoon at North Division Court in Vista. The department said it learned on May 2 that Lambesis, 32, had asked someone to carry out the killing and an investigation was initiated. The investigation culminated Tuesday afternoon, ""when Lambesis solicited an undercover detective to kill his wife,"" it said. He was arrested without incident at a business in Oceanside and taken to the Encinitas Station and booked into the Vista Detention Facility. Last September, Meggan Lambesis filed with San Diego Superior Court to have the marriage dissolved. The band issued a statement Wednesday through its record label, Metal Blade, to its fans saying: ""As we post this, the legal process is taking it's course and we have no more information than you do. There are many unanswered questions, and the situation will become clearer in the coming days and weeks. We'll keep you informed as best we can. ""Our thoughts right now are with Tim, his family, and with everyone else affected by this terrible situation."" As I Lay Dying was nominated in 2008 for a Grammy Award for best metal performance. During the decade since it was formed, the band has released seven studio albums and a live CD, according to its website. Asked last year in an interview with HardNoise Online Radio about how his time on the road affected his home life, Lambesis said, ""If there was a way to be home but still make a living playing music, I would do that in a heartbeat. ""But the catch is that, as a profession, this is what I'm passionate about. And then my personal life, what I'm passionate about is my loved ones back home. So, you know, those two have a conflict with each other. The only thing I can do is find a balance where, if I am gone a month on tour, then I find a month to be home and just kind of even it out that way."" Asked in January about whether his group was a Christian metal band, he told NoiseCreep that the band had decided not to discuss ""the spiritual topic"" so that listeners would focus on their music. ""We didn't preach at our shows, our goal has always been to just write the best music we can write,"" he said. ""Of course religion has some influence on the things that we write about just like all of our life experiences do but as a band, we want to be judged on the music rather than what our personal beliefs are.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A Blackwater USA employee who was fired after he allegedly shot and killed an Iraqi security guard on Christmas Eve last year was hired by another private contractor to work in the region less than two months later. Congress has been taking a closer look at the government's use of private security contractors. Andrew J. Moonen returned to the United States within a few days of the incident, his attorney said, but in February he returned to Kuwait, working for Defense Department contractor Combat Support Associates (CSA), a company spokesman said.  Mooney worked for CSA from February to August of this year, spokesman Paul Gennaro said. Because the State Department and Blackwater kept the incident quiet and out of Moonen's personnel records, CSA was unaware of the December incident when it hired Moonen. According to Moonen's personnel record, the U.S. Army tried to call him back to service in April 2007, but canceled the request when they were notified he was overseas. Moonen, 27, had served in the Army's 82nd Airborne Division from April 2002 to April 2005 before joining Blackwater. Moonen is accused of fatally shooting an Iraqi guard who was on duty near the Iraqi prime minister's compound, according to a Congressional memo describing the investigation report. The guard was struck three times and Moonen fled the scene, according to the memo. Moonen had been at a Christmas Eve party in Baghdad's Green Zone, the memo said. Witnesses said he was drunk. According to the report, Moonen went to the guard post of another contracting firm, Triple Canopy, and said he'd been in a gunfight with Iraqis. He said they were chasing him and firing at him, but a report by Triple Canopy says its guards had not heard gunfire. Moonen's attorney did not dispute the version of events as laid out in the Congressional memo. Moonen's case was discussed at length at a hearing on Capitol Hill this week, during which State Department officials conceded the Justice Department was still trying to determine whether they had jurisdiction to prosecute Moonen. Moonen was fined, fired and flown home from Iraq, and the company later paid $20,000 in compensation to the victim's family. His identity had been kept private by government authorities and Blackwater, but the New York Times disclosed his name in a morning report Thursday. Blackwater CEO Erik Prince testified Tuesday before Congress' House Oversight Committee that after the Christmas Eve incident, Moonen was fired for ""violating alcohol and firearm policy.""  ""We fired him. We fined him. But we, as a private organization, can't do any more,"" Prince told the committee. ""We can't flog him. We can't incarcerate him. That's up to the Justice Department. We are not empowered to enforce U.S. law."" Prince also said he'd be happy to see further investigation and prosecution by the Justice Department.  The House of Representatives, breaking with the Bush administration, voted overwhelmingly Thursday to bring private military contractors overseas like Moonen under U.S. jurisdiction. The bill would put contractors working for the U.S. government overseas under the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act, which allows American courts to prosecute crimes committed overseas in war zones. The 389-30 vote followed a warning from the White House that the measure would have ""unintended and intolerable consequences"" for national security. But its sponsor, Rep. David Price, D-North Carolina, said the bill would hold contractors ""working in our name and on our dime"" accountable for misconduct. ""If we can't ensure the rule of law for our own personnel, how can we credibly ask other countries like Iraq to uphold the rule of law when their own citizens commit crimes?"" he asked on the House floor Wednesday.  Price said the bill would clear up questions such as those raised by last month's Baghdad shootings involving contractors from Blackwater.  Blackwater said its guards responded properly to an attack on a U.S. Embassy convoy September 16. But Iraqi authorities said Blackwater contractors fired indiscriminately at civilians, killing as many as 20 at two scenes in western Baghdad. But Rep. Randy Forbes, R-Virginia, said the bill could interfere with intelligence-gathering and expose ""clandestine assets"" to prosecutions that could expose ongoing operations. ""The majority, in its haste to score political points, has ignored the intelligence community's concerns about the bill,"" he said. Prince has said his company supports Price's bill.   Under an order laid down by the U.S. occupation government in Iraq, U.S. contractors can't be prosecuted under Iraqi law. Prince said he thinks that rule should stand. ""I'm not sure any foreigner would get a fair trial in Iraq right now,"" he said. ""I think they'd at least get a fair trial here in the United States."" E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- If Jose Mourinho's time at Real Madrid is nearing an end then he seems determined not to go quietly. The outspoken Portuguese coach's time at the Spanish giants -- one of the world's biggest soccer clubs -- has been adorned with three major trophies but also with a healthy dose of controversy. He has had to fend off regular reports of dressing room unrest and a rift with one of Real's key players, goalkeeper Iker Casillas, the World Cup-winning captain of Spain. The 50-year-old has been strongly linked with a return to the English Premier League and former club Chelsea, with the current coach of the London-based club hinting on Tuesday Mourinho is set to replace him. But for the time being, Mourinho remains in situ at Real and used his latest press conference to hit back at defender Pepe, who had criticized his treatment of the benched Casillas in the press. Pepe has lost his place in the side to young French defender Rafael Varane in recent weeks. Mourinho, in typically bullish mood, told reporters: ""Pepe's problem is easy to analyze. His name is Varane. You don't have to be a genius, just a normal guy like me to understand that we're talking about frustration. ""It's not easy for a player to see how he's outperformed by a 19 year-old kid, but the kid is fantastic. I had the courage to play him and the problem is very simple. Pepe's life as an athlete has changed. ""He was permanent starter and it is also one of my decisions that didn't lead to a public discussion. I understand his frustration perfectly, and that it translated into what he said. ""Things are clear and I have no issue with him. It's not an easy situation. I have to try to be honest and most people think that Real Madrid's defensive future is Varane and Ramos."" Mourinho's decision to drop Casillas, who has been with Real his entire career and is a poster boy to the club's many fans, has been met with many questions. After Casillas picked up an injury in January, Mourinho signed Sevilla's Diego Lopez, and continued to play him even after Casillas regained full fitness. It led to much criticism of the coach, who reiterated on Tuesday that Lopez's style of goalkeeping was more to his liking. ""I like Diego Lopez as a goalkeeper more than Casillas,"" he explained. ""It's not personal, I just like him more. I like a goalkeeper that comes out and dominates the airspace and plays with his feet. ""Iker is fantastic under the posts and I can also say that he likes a coach like (Spanish national team coach) Vicente Del Bosque or with a different profile more. ""One's more offensive, the other defensive. I have the right to say this and with me, in normal conditions, Diego Lopez is going to play. People can say what they want, I accept that but please respect a coach who decides who plays."" Mourinho's time at the Bernabeu has been mixed. He has won one La Liga title, last season, but looks set to miss out to archrivals Barcelona this time around. His quest to win the European Champions League for a third time in his career has also faltered. Recently, his side were beaten 4-3 on aggregate by German club Borussia Dortmund at the semifinal stage. Mourinho has made no secret of his desire to return to England with media reports claiming he has already negotiated a return to Chelsea at the end of the season. His previous spell in charge saw him lead the club to their first top flight title for 55 years. He won five trophies in his three seasons in London. Only last week he said, ""I know I am loved by some clubs, especially one,"" which was widely regarded as confirmation of his desire to once again coach at Stamford Bridge. On Tuesday Chelsea's current manager, Rafael Benitez, confirmed he would be leaving at the end of the season and added: ""The next year there will be another manager. I think everybody knows who will be here."" Mourinho, who has a contract at Real until 2016, revealed he's considered remaining at Real and refuted claims that is to do with a dispute over his severance package. Reports in Spain and the UK claim whoever breaks their agreement will owe the other party $26 million. ""I've considered staying. The fans think what you, the press, sell them,"" he said. ""To make things clear I'll tell you that I'll be paid until my last working day here. I don't want even one euro more the day I decide that I'm not going to continue.""","Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho says Pepe's criticism of him borne out of frustration .

"(CNN) -- The death of Slayer founder and Grammy-winning heavy metal guitarist Jeff Hanneman launched speculation Friday that focused on a spider bite. Hanneman, 49, died Thursday of liver failure in Southern California, the band said in a statement. Though there was no official word from a physician or medical professional about Hanneman's death, several news outlets reported what Hanneman's band said in a statement Friday -- that the rocker's death was connected to a spider bite that he suffered at least more than a year ago. On the band's website, a statement read that in January Hanneman contracted necrotizing fasciitis ""likely caused by a spider bite, and has been undergoing surgeries, skin grafts and intense rehab since."" Necrotizing fasciitis is a flesh-eating condition. Read about necrotizing faciitis . On Friday, CNN's Elizabeth Cohen spoke to Dr. Donna Seger who routinely treats spider-bite victims at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Tennessee. The state is known for its recluse spider population. Seger, a medical doctor, is the medical director of Tennessee Poison Center and professor of medicine and emergency medicine at Vanderbilt. She said that spider bites do not lead to organ failure. But infections -- which could develop after a variety of scenarios ranging from a mosquito bite or even a scratch on the skin from a nail -- can sometimes lead to bad outcomes. Could Hanneman have been suffering from an infection? And from what? Without his treating physician weighing in, that is unclear. Seger stressed that, on the whole, patients with spider bites recover fine if they follow medical instructions and keep their bite areas clean so that a scab can form and fall off. ""I think it's really important that spider bites be understood because there's so many urban legends about, you know, you get a spider bite, your limb falls off and you die,"" Seger said. ""That doesn't happen."" Separate from discussion on the cause of death, the musician's passing reverberated throughout the music community. The guitarist was with Slayer from its founding in 1981. Its breakthrough came five years later with the release of ""Reign in Blood,"" an album that included two songs -- ""Angel of Death"" and ""Raining Blood"" -- co-written by Hanneman. That was one of 10 studio albums that the band put out over three decades together, during which they performed thousands of shows. On Slayer's official website, Hanneman said that the last one -- ""World Painted Blood"" -- came together quickly because the band's members worked seamlessly. ""The interaction between all of us on this record was really something special,"" he said. ""... The chemistry was just good."" In 2006 and 2007, Slayer won Grammy awards for best metal performance. The metal world -- in tweets from, among many others, the bands Rancid, Hatebreed, In Flames and Testament -- reacted to Hanneman's death with sadness and appreciation, referring to him as a ""true heavy metal legend"" and a ""brother in thrash."" ""Jeff Hanneman will always be a metal god,"" wrote rocker Andrew WK. ""A true master, he gave energy and excitement to millions, and will continue to. #PartyForSlayer.""

"(CNN) -- When the public thinks about suicide, they tend to see it as something that typically affects adolescents and people in later life. But alarmingly, more middle-aged Americans are dying by suicide. A new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows a nearly 30% increase in the suicide rate among adults 35 to 64, with the most significant increase in those 50 and older. Why the suicide rate is climbing in this age group is a question without a simple answer. There are many risk factors, including high unemployment rates and a weak economy that has been pervasive at all levels of our society; the widespread abuse of prescription pain medication; the problems experienced by aging veterans of the Vietnam War or the Gulf War; the difficulty in convincing men, in particular, to seek help for physical and mental illnesses; and the realities of the baby boomer generation, a group that has experienced unusually high levels of addiction, suicide attempts and mental illness as young adults. The CDC report makes it clear that we must continue to fund scientific research exploring the causes of suicide. It confirms the need to use evidence-based knowledge to expand our research and prevention efforts, in particular, to underserved populations. Suicide prevention programs have typically focused on youth, young adults and the elderly. Now we know we need to do more for those in middle age. Fortunately, there are measures we can take to prevent suicide. We know that the majority of people who die by suicide have an underlying and often undiagnosed mental illness such as depression or bipolar disorder. Are we doing enough to reduce the stigma associated with talking about, and seeking treatment for, mental health conditions? President Barack Obama has recently called on the nation to expand efforts to address mental health problems and to eliminate the stigma associated with seeking treatment. He is right. We know, too, that there can be warning signs before a suicide attempt. Are we educating health care professionals, teachers, social workers and family members to recognize the signs of serious depression, such as expressions of pessimism and hopelessness, a low mood that does not change, sleeping problems and withdrawal from typical activities? We understand that suicide can be an impulsive act and that alcoholism, substance abuse and access to lethal means can increase its likelihood. Are we doing enough to train physicians to recognize the signs of addiction? Are we training emergency room doctors to ask about access to firearms and drugs? Are we educating family members about how to provide safe and supportive environments for those with a mental illness? Finally, are we talking openly about the reality of living with mental illness and sharing treatment options and approaches that may help those with disorders live productive and fulfilling lives? Are we moving to a place where we can be as comfortable discussing mental illness and its treatment as we are in discussing blood sugar levels related to diabetes or the cholesterol drugs for heart disease? A world in which mental illness can be addressed openly without embarrassment or fear of discrimination is not beyond reach. If we pay for the research that can uncover the mysteries of the brain, strive to understand what helps prevent suicide in diverse populations and are committed to helping those at risk receive the treatment they need, we can prevent the losses -- one life at a time. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Robert Gebbia.","A new report shows a 30% increase in the suicide rate among middle-aged Americans .

"Washington (CNN) -- The future of the Korean peninsula relies on U.S. involvement in the peace process, South Korean President Park Geun-hye told a joint meeting of Congress Wednesday. Park said that despite recent tensions with communist North Korea, reunification of the Koreas is possible, even if it ""feels distant today."" ""North Korea continues to issue threats and provocations, firing long range missiles, staging nuclear tests and undermining peace on the peninsula and far beyond it,"" Park said. ""The Korean government is reacting resolutely but calmly. We maintain the highest level of readiness."" And as long as the United States and South Korea maintain their strong relationship, Park said, ""You may rest assured, no North Koreans provocation can succeed."" Throughout much of late March and April, North Korea ratcheted tensions with the United States and South Korea by issuing a cadre of bellicose statements on nuclear war with the South. Recently, however, tensions have begun to wane, signaled by the fact that, according to a U.S. official, North Korea has withdrawn two mobile ballistic missiles from a launch site in the eastern part of the country. Initially, U.S. defense officials told CNN that the missiles' movements to the area signaled North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un was planning to test launch missiles. In response, the United States and Japan stepped up missile defenses in the region. Park said moves like this did nothing for the peace process. ""I am confident that trust is the path to peace, the path to a Korea that is whole again,"" she said. ""The Republic of Korea will never accept a nuclear armed North Korea. Pyongyang's provocations will be met decisively."" The North has long used missile tests and its nuclear arsenal as a way to extract concessions and rewards from the international community. Park said this strategy is part of the North's ""incompatible"" aim to pursue ""two goals at once."" ""You cannot have your cake and eat it too,"" Park said. Her speech to Congress comes just a day after she met with President Barack Obama at the White House. Obama, in a news conference after the meeting, said that North Korea's recent provocations have only made the United States and South Korea closer. ""If Pyongyang thought its recent threats would drive a wedge between South Korea and the United States or somehow garner the North international respect, today is further evidence that North Korea has failed again,"" Obama said. ""The United States and the Republic of Korea are as united as ever ... North Korea is more isolated than ever."" Park, South Korea's first female president, took office in February, shortly before North Korea conducted its most recent nuclear test and has since taken a tough stance on perceived aggression from the North. In an interview with CBS Monday, Park said even a small attack would warrant a military response. ""Yes, we will make them pay,"" she said. In her remarks Wednesday, Park also singled out the four current members of Congress who served during the Korean War -- Rep. John Conyers, Rep. Charles Rangel, Rep. Sam Johnson and Rep. Howard Coble. Each congressman stood as Park acknowledged them and received loud applause for their service. ""Gentleman, my country thanks you,"" she said. Park said as part of her visit, she traveled to the Korean War Memorial on the National Mall in Washington. Citing an inscription at the monument -- ""Our nation honors our sons and daughters who answered the call to defend a country they never knew and a people they never met"" -- Park reflected on what those words meant to the country she now leads. ""Time and again, I am moved when I read those familiar words,"" she said. ""Our profound gratitude to America's veterans, their blood, sweat and tears helped safeguard freedom and democracy."" CNN's Gabriella Schwarz and Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","South Korea's president says even a small attack from the North would warrant military response .

"(CNN) -- Like many aspiring singers on YouTube, 17-year-old Carley Allison has uploaded several videos of herself belting out covers and original songs. But her most popular YouTube video, which was later posted on CNN iReport, was shot just after doctors sliced a hole in her neck. A golf-ball-sized tumor -- what turned out to be an extremely rare cancer -- was causing her to have difficulty breathing, and she needed an emergency tracheotomy. Even after the tracheotomy, she could still sing. ""Music has been my passion ever since I was young,"" the Toronto resident wrote on her blog. ""I started taking guitar lessons when I was 11 years old, and I've been singing for as long as I can remember."" Allison hopes that, despite the tumor, she'll still be able to pursue singing as a career. The diagnosis . Music wasn't always the primary focus of Allison's life. She initially hoped to become a competitive figure skater, training six days a week for more than five years. The intense training was something she learned from her mother, who was an Olympic marathon runner in 1996. It was through skating that Allison first suspected something might be wrong. ""Her skating coach noticed that just walking up a flight of stairs, she'd breathe hard,"" said her mother, May Allison. It seemed unusual that such a young athlete might have trouble breathing. Allison and her family went for a year believing -- as doctors told them -- that she had asthma. But a CT scan in February revealed a clear cell sarcoma outside the trachea. Allison knew her skating career would be put on hold. Teen with cancer blogs her bucket list . A rediscovered passion . Without skating to fill her time, Allison turned her efforts to singing. She has uploaded seven videos to YouTube in the past year, where she has nearly 50,000 views. ""Everything happens for a reason,"" she said of her condition. ""It was an easy switch to put music as the biggest thing in my life right now ... and my music has taken off, which is nice."" In April, her videos received the notice of actress and pop star Selena Gomez. Gomez tweeted, ""Carley Allison you are so strong girl. Love you! And praying for you. Keep singing."" The words echo many of the comments on Allison's YouTube and Twitter pages -- and helped her singing videos take off online. She has certainly followed Gomez's advice, too. Singing is ""therapeutic for her in a way,"" said her mother. May Allison believes this is the best way her daughter has found to deal with the fact that she has a hole in her trachea and her hair has been shaved down, and it's how she has chosen to express herself. Her daughter put it this way: ""Before February 4, my biggest problem was trying to find a prom dress."" May Allison added, ""She wants to make something of (her condition) instead of moping around."" Allison's focus on singing isn't unusual for a patient, said Dr. Michael E. Kupferman of the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. He has seen others with cancer turn to creative outlets. ""Any kind of devastating medical situation will make people more introspective,"" he explained. ""Artists' careers have sometimes evolved having gone through cancer. I've seen patients find that creativity to express themselves whether in music or in art. We've seen that for millennia. It changes the tenor of their art and productivity."" What the future holds . Will Allison still be able to belt out her songs in the same way when her cancer is eventually surgically removed? Luckily, ""her vocal cords are not involved with the tumor,"" according to her mother. Teen beating the odds after brain injury . However, she added, ""The one side that the tumor's on, the vocal cord nerve may be affected by the tumor. It's very difficult to tell on the CT scan. We're hoping the chemotherapy will help the situation."" Allison herself maintains a positive attitude. ""There is a smaller chance there may be some permanent damage, but I try not to think about that,"" she said. Early on, there were some fears as well. Allison admitted that she was originally scared by her diagnosis after searching online. She has since mostly stayed away from searching for information on her illness. When the family learned about the tumor, May Allison said she and her husband got choked up. ""(Carley) turned to us in a calm voice and said she was glad it was her and not anyone else in the family, because she knew she could handle it."" Despite being told there was a 5% chance that chemotherapy would affect a tumor in the trachea, the tumor has become softer since treatment and has moved away from the thyroid gland, which makes it easier to remove surgically. No matter what happens, Allison still plans to pursue her passions. She's still thinking about a possible singing career, despite the fact that she had to cancel an audition for Boston's Berklee College of Music a few days after she was diagnosed. She looks forward to getting back on the ice one day as well. It's that unstoppable attitude that has been the most inspirational to witness, her mother said. ""From an early age, Carley always knew what she wanted and had no fear trying to get it,"" she said. ""For her, every day presents a new opportunity to take a step closer. The interesting thing about Carley is that she actually enjoys the journey as much as achieving her goals. When things don't go according to plan, she rallies quickly and moves on. She has the ability to make anything fun and finds it very difficult to sit still."" ""She's been able to touch people,"" May Allison added. ""Her public school raised $5,000 in a fundraiser for (Toronto's) Sick Kids Hospital where she's having her chemotherapy. There are thousands of dollars coming into Princess Margaret Hospital where she has the link on her blog. She's very proud of that."" In the meantime, Allison continues to inspire people on social media with her positive attitude. ""For me to be able to reach out to other people throughout all this has been great,"" she said. ""People want to hear from me and hear my music right now so it keeps me happy. I cherish every moment. I have a different perspective on everything now. In the end, I think it will make me a better person."" 36 stories that prove citizen journalism matters .","Carley Allison has a cancerous tumor in her trachea .

"(CNN) -- In the 4x100 sprint relay, it is the handoffs that decide the winner. Speed is important, but without a top-notch changeover, you're out. The maneuver is a perfectly orchestrated move performed in a split second without looking. It's all about teamwork, something Tianna Madison knows a thing or two about. She was part of the U.S. team that won gold in the relay at the London Olympics, shattering the world record in the process. Read related: London 2012's top-10 sporting moments . Madison is now back in the U.S., using the lessons she learned on the track to help young girls learn their worth and make positive choices for the future. As a role model, she is not shy to share her experiences -- including the downs in her life: ""I went from being World Champion long jumper in 2005, to nothing in the last seven years, to now being an Olympian. ""I dealt with a bankruptcy; I had my home foreclosed, and these were things that happened and I was not honest with myself about why I was in that situation,"" she said. Crucially for her career, she realized that she couldn't deal with everything on her own. She was lucky enough to get help and support from her husband. Building on this experience, she started Club 360, to give young women love and support, which they might not find elsewhere. Madison sat down with CNN to talk about the ups and downs of her career and how they motivated her to start the program. CNN: What is Club 360 and why did you decide to start it? Tianna Madison: Club 360 is a personal development program for girls aged nine and up. We teach girls and young women the importance of living with integrity, honor, and self-respect and we do that through both online and offline activities. They can learn good habits, take their weaknesses and make them into strengths. CNN: Why did you decide to incorporate your ideals of ""honor, integrity and self-respect"" into Club 360's platform? TM: Integrity means I will not waver from where I want to be, cut corners or cheat myself. When I met my husband, he had a hard conversation with me: I had a weakness where I would say one thing but my action would indicate something else. I would say I wanted to be a great athlete, but I would only give 50% at practice. I learned to be very honest with myself so I know exactly where I am. I can take those weaknesses and turn them into my strengths. Honor means that if I say I am going to do ten reps, I will do ten reps. Sometimes 12. It is important to me to bring honor to my sport, to the people I work with, and to my husband. I can only do that by setting the course. Self-respect: Don't do anything that would derail you or damage you. When you know for a fact who you are and what you want, peer pressure really doesn't exist. CNN: How does teamwork play into it? TM: In a relay, you have to be trusted and you have to trust the next runner. That is what made our team successful. Allyson Felix trusted me to hand her the baton and I trusted her to give me a good target to give her the baton.

But this is definitely not a sob story! I also went from being World Champion long jumper in 2005, to nothing in the last seven years, to now being an Olympian. I dealt with a bankruptcy; I had my home foreclosed, and these were things that happened and I was not honest with myself about why I was in that situation. It wasn't until (last) September that I was able to do that. It took someone like my husband to give me the love and tools to help me change it. It was not something I could do on my own.

"(CNN) -- How do you keep hope alive? The news of the recovery of Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus, along with Michelle Knight, sent shock waves through the nation and the community of folks who used to work at ""America's Most Wanted,"" a show that ran for decades, trying to bring missing children home. When you deal with tragedy every day, you absolutely live for moments like these -- moments that came all too rarely. I don't think we aired Knight's case -- she was an adult when she went missing, and we sadly had to draw the line on those cases -- but we did tell Berry and DeJesus' stories, and they became close to our hearts. We worked like madmen when children went missing, because we knew that if they were not recovered that first day or possibly the next, the chances that they were still alive began to diminish rapidly. And yet, as days turned into weeks and months, I would listen to the families and to the cops and FBI agents on this case, and hundreds of others, and I would marvel at their determination and their belief that we would, in fact, solve this one. Or this one. Or this one. And I wondered: How did they all manage, in the midst of such sorrow, to keep hope alive? It was a question I have pondered all my life. I was about the age Berry is now when my stepsister, Jackie, disappeared. She suffered from schizophrenia and one night ran out of our house in Rockaway, New York, in a mania-induced rage. She was last seen headed to Manhattan on the A train, wearing no coat in the middle of winter, probably without a dime in her pocket. My family was not one of those brave, strong families I would meet years later; Jackie's disappearance tore our family apart. Her mother was driven to madness by the not-knowing, my father driven to depression and attempted suicide by a life that had become a lonely prison, caged in by his wife's grief. They became, thoroughly and utterly, hopeless. I suppose that working on ""America's Most Wanted"" gave me a chance to do for others what I could not do for my own family -- and, sure enough, the very first story I worked on was the case of a missing 5-year-old girl from Boston. We managed to bring that girl home to her family, and until I had a child of my own, it remained the most important thing I had ever done in my life. Before ""America's Most Wanted"" was canceled, 60 missing children were found. And in every case, every one, you could trace the successful return of that child to someone -- a family member, a cop -- who just decided to never give up hope. Our host, John Walsh, a man who'd lost his own child to terrible violence, would never let us give up on a case. And so we pressed on. Whenever a child would go missing, the media would jump all over the story for a few days and then move on to other things. But we kept airing the case, year after year, hoping against hope that something would turn up. Whenever the energy to keep going on a case would flag, someone would remind us of the miracles that came before. Along with the families, we were buoyed -- elated, overjoyed -- by cases like Shawn Hornbeck, an 11-year-old who disappeared from a country road near his parents' home in Missouri in October 2002 and was found alive four years later. And whose parents never, ever gave up hoping. Elizabeth Smart, whom we found after she was held for nine months by a so-called street preacher. Or the astounding case of Jaycee Lee Dugard, who was recovered after 18 long years and who was honored Tuesday night -- in one of those wonderful moments of synchronicity -- at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's annual Hope Awards. As so many people rejoice, I have to admit to some pangs of sadness as I watch the news of the recovery of Berry, DeJesus and Knight. I know there are so many families, like my own, who fear that they will never see their loved ones again. We think of the joy that DeJesus and Knight's families must feel. We watch as Berry's relatives exult at her return: ""I'm excited to see her,"" said her cousin. ""I'm excited to hold her, excited to squeeze her, to tell her how much I love her and miss her"" -- and know that we may never get to say those words. I talked to Lance Heflin today, my old boss, and he told me, ""People who don't follow this don't realize what an absolute miracle this is. This just doesn't happen. When you do this for a living you realize, this is a goddamned miracle."" And it is that fact -- that miracles do indeed happen -- that every family of every missing child is trying to hold onto. I know, because I have spent 15 years working with them, that moments like these remind you: The hardest thing to do is, in the end, the only thing to do. You have to. There is no choice. You have to keep hope alive. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Philip Lerman.","Philip Lerman oversaw the missing child cases for ""America's Most Wanted""

"Orlando (CNN) -- ""Businesses adding jobs"" is a headline every elected official loves to read. Sadly, it's one that's getting harder and harder to find because of a policy and regulatory landscape that makes it increasingly difficult for businesses to see why and where creating new jobs makes sense. That's especially true for me and my colleagues in the restaurant industry, who find ourselves facing a plate piled high with more and more federal, state and local regulations. Regulatory mandates flowing from federal health care reform may be the most visible, but the list also includes measures such as new mandatory paid leave provisions that require us to change the way we accommodate employees who need to take time off when they are ill and ever more unrealistic requirements regarding employee meal and rest breaks that, in California for example, force our employees to take breaks in the middle of serving lunch or dinner. This reality is the result of the best intentions. Policymakers working in silos at every level are pushing through regulations that on their face seem to address admirable goals -- that are each directed at outcomes that seem desirable. The cumulative effect of these regulations, however, is significant damage to the hard-working Americans who are the intended beneficiaries. The employer mandate contained in the new health care reform law, for example, forces us to change the way we have offered health care coverage to our full- and part-time workers and, together with all the other looming regulations, causes us to rethink the way we schedule the hourly work force that is at the heart of how we deliver our product to customers. Some suggest we accommodate the costs of new regulations in one of two ways: Accept lower profits, or charge customers more. Neither is a realistic alternative for many businesses, and certainly not for those in our industry. Like most in retail, low profit margins are a fact of life for us for good reason -- low margins are consistent with charging prices our customers can afford. The difficult reality is that neither our shareholders nor our customers -- who are of course, the very working people policymakers champion -- can afford the cost of the unbridled increase in regulation we're experiencing. This is not to say that the restaurant industry should not be appropriately regulated. Food safety and cleanliness standards are just two examples of categories of regulation we welcome given their importance in helping protect two critical elements of our promise to our guests, which are their safety and well-being. So, what are restaurants doing about all of this? We are labor-intensive businesses and always will be, but we're relying more and more on technologies that make our businesses less labor intensive. It's an ominous development considering restaurants' role as a path to opportunity and entrepreneurship. More than half of today's adults worked in food service at some point in their career, for example -- whether as a first job, a way to pay for higher education, a bridge to a new direction in their lives or as a path to a career in restaurant or food service management. To preserve this important driver of economic opportunity, we need policymakers to understand the snowball effect of too many regulations. Their collective effect is to threaten job creation and prevent us in the restaurant industry from doing our part to put our economy back on its feet. Policymakers and pundits bemoan the economic news of the day and chastise the business community for not ""investing"" or creating jobs to help lead us out of the recession. But through the lens of a business owner, a regulatory ""perfect storm"" is forming that causes even the most well-intentioned business leaders to pause. Some industries -- including the restaurant industry -- continue to grow and add jobs, but what we see on the horizon puts that at risk. In the year ahead, the company I lead expects to open roughly 80 new locations, each with about 100 jobs. The entire industry projects adding 1.3 million jobs over the next decade, according to the National Restaurant Association. My plea to policymakers is simple: Before you impose another well-meaning mandate, consider the burden we already bear and engage us in conversation. Regulations are not inherently detrimental to growth. Responsible companies such as ours, that have been supportive of the president and elected officials of both parties across the country, won't say ""no"" to everything and, indeed, what you might find is that we can help craft solutions that truly are better for everyone. Our success depends on our ability to deliver on three promises: a promise to our guests to provide them exceptional dining experiences at appropriate value; a promise to our employees to provide them jobs with appropriate compensation, benefits and opportunity for advancement; and a promise to our shareholders to provide them appropriate returns on their investment. Our ability to deliver on these promises in the future is directly challenged by the regulations we see as we look ahead.

"Washington (CNN) -- USIS, the government contractor that did the background check on former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, used a practice known as ""dumping"" to issue incomplete background checks to the government for security clearances, according to a whistle-blower lawsuit the Justice Department joined on Wednesday. The private suit brought in Alabama by a former USIS employee, Blake Percival, claims that USIS aimed to boost revenue and maximize profits by using proprietary computer software to automatically release incomplete background checks done at the request of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The suit claims USIS improperly billed the government agency for checks that the company knew were not done under terms of its contract. USIS, based in Falls Church, Virginia, has been under fire for months as lawmakers have lodged criticisms of the company for what they say is shoddy work on government background checks. Several former employees have been prosecuted by the Justice Department for allegedly not doing background investigations that they were assigned to do under USIS's contract with OPM. In a statement, USIS said it is cooperating with the government investigation: ""The behavior by a small number of employees alleged in the complaint is completely inconsistent with our company values, culture and tradition of outstanding service to our government customers. USIS has taken these allegations seriously since they were first brought to our attention more than 18 months ago. We have acted decisively to ensure the quality of our work and adherence to OPM requirements, as we continue to perform under our OPM contracts. We have put in place new leadership, enhanced oversight procedures, and improved protocols that have been shared with OPM."" The company did background checks on Snowden, who has been the source of thousands of leaked documents on the NSA's surveillance activities, and Aaron Alexis, the Washington Navy Yard shooter. The company did the Alexis check properly according to OPM guidelines, the agency has said. Lawmakers have raised questions, however, about the Snowden background check, saying there were problems USIS may have missed. OPM has said it has an ongoing investigation of USIS that doesn't relate to the Snowden background check. The Alabama suit is filed under the False Claims Act, which allows so-called whistle-blowers to sue on behalf of the government and collect a share of funds recovered in the lawsuit. The Justice Department often reviews such lawsuits and decides whether or not to join; joining such suits usually increases the chance of success because the government uses its legal resources. The Justice Department said Wednesday it has asked a federal court in Montgomery, Alabama, to be given until Jan. 22, 2014, to file its own legal complaint in the case. A group of lawmakers, including Sen. Claire McCaskill, of Missouri, announced legislation to tighten government security clearance requirements, ordering more frequent audits of employees and contractors with those clearances. ""There are systemic failures in the current process that are jeopardizing our ability to protect our nation's secrets and our secure facilities,"" said McCaskill, a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.","U.S. Justice Department joins lawsuit filed in Alabama .

"London (CNN) -- The UK government has put immigration reform and the economy at the heart of its plans for the new parliamentary session, which opened Wednesday with the Queen's Speech. The address by Queen Elizabeth II for the ceremonial state opening of Parliament is written by the government, although read out by the monarch. At the center of the government's legislative agenda is a new bill with ""tough new measures to continue immigration reform and prevent illegal immigrants accessing services they're not entitled to,"" the Home Office said. ""The bill will ensure that this country attracts people who will contribute and deters those who will not,"" the queen said. The legislation will also ""contain measures to make it harder for people to prevent their removal with spurious appeals, reduce the complexity of immigration law and make clear that foreign national offenders should be deported, except in extraordinary circumstances,"" the Home Office said. A move to the right on immigration may be a response to the political threat posed by the UK Independence Party, known as UKIP, which has made gains in local elections at the expense of the Conservatives. UKIP has promised steps to limit the number of migrants entering Britain. Measures to make deportation easier may also reflect the Home Office's long-running, and so far unsuccessful, efforts to deport radical Islamist cleric Abu Qatada. A series of legal appeals have kept the Jordanian national in the country. Lawmaker Yvette Cooper, of the opposition Labour Party, criticized the measures outlined in the Queen's Speech, saying they fail to tackle key issues around the exploitation of foreign workers and illegal immigration. ""Immigration is important for Britain and needs to be controlled and managed so it is fair for all,"" she said. Welfare reforms . The government will also work to boost Britain's economic competitiveness so it can continue to succeed in the world, the Queen's Speech said. ""To this end, it will support the growth of the private sector and the creation of more jobs and opportunities,"" the queen said. In addition, the government intends to pass new measures to tackle anti-social behavior, cut crime and reform the police. The legislative agenda also includes more measures to reform the state benefits system, ""helping people move from welfare to work,"" the speech said. The government's sweeping welfare reforms, affecting state help for the disabled and unemployed, have already been controversial in Britain, which is struggling with a large budget deficit. The Conservatives govern in coalition with the Liberal Democrats. Queen Elizabeth II to miss Commonwealth heads meeting . The Queen's Speech also said the government ""will continue to make the case for Scotland to remain in the United Kingdom."" Scots will go to the polls next year to decide whether Scotland should stay in the United Kingdom or become independent. Prime Minister David Cameron has previously said he wants Scotland to remain part of the United Kingdom. The queen's appearance at Parliament, accompanied by her husband, Prince Philip, came a day after Buckingham Palace said it was reviewing the number of long-haul flights she takes. The monarch will miss a meeting of Commonwealth heads of government in Sri Lanka in November, sending her son, Prince Charles, in her place. CNN's Antonia Mortensen contributed to this report.","Queen Elizabeth II reads a speech to Parliament that sets out the government's agenda .

"Beijing (CNN) -- A cold case involving the poisoning of a college sophomore in Beijing almost two decades ago has captured the imagination of Chinese communities around the world, landing a petition on the White House website and igniting an emotional debate on the pursuit of justice in China. Zhu Ling was a chemistry major at the prestigious Tsinghua University, often called ""China's MIT,"" when she started experiencing stomach pain, hair loss and other inexplicable symptoms in late 1994, state-run news agency Xinhua reported in a story published in April. Doctors eventually diagnosed her with poisoning by thallium, a highly toxic chemical used in rodent and insect poisons. Police investigated one of Zhu's roommates, Sun Wei, but subsequently cleared her as a suspect, Xinhua said. The authorities have so far remained quiet on the case. Although domestic Chinese media had covered the unsolved mystery in the past, news of a fatal poisoning case at a Shanghai college dorm in April rekindled national -- and even global -- interest in Zhu's story. In the Shanghai case, police quickly identified the victim's roommate as the suspect and arrested him for alleged murder. As events unfolded in Shanghai, Chinese reporters and Internet users increasingly looked back at the Zhu case and highlighted her plight. Now almost 40 years old, Zhu remains mostly bed-ridden and appears overweight in recent photos. Once an accomplished musician and avid swimmer, she is practically blind and has the mental capacity of a 6-year-old child. Was investigation botched? Amid new outpourings of sympathy, speculation on the investigation abounds across Chinese cyberspace. On Sina Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter with more than 300 million users, many posts alleged a botched process complete with vanishing crucial evidence and mounting political pressure due to the Sun family's powerful connections. Sun's grandfather was a high-ranking official in the Nationalist government before the Communist takeover in 1949. He later held senior -- though largely symbolic -- positions in the People's Republic until his death in 1995. Another close relative, a cousin of Sun's father, was considered a national leader from 1993 to 2003 when he was a vice-chairman of China's top political advisory body. Sun has reportedly made three online statements on Tianya, a popular Chinese Internet discussion forum, according to state media. CNN's efforts to reach Sun and her family Tuesday were unsuccessful. In 2005, Sun stated that police took her in for questioning in April 1997 because of her access to thallium. She said police cleared her as a suspect in August 1998 due to lack of evidence. Sun added that she was not the only student with access to the toxic substance and denied personal animosity between herself and Zhu. Addressing her family's political connections, she said her grandfather had died by the time she was questioned. In 2006, Sun said her family had submitted an application to the police on her behalf requesting the authorities re-open the investigation to ""find the truth."" In April, after the Shanghai poisoning reignited public interest in Zhu's case, Sun resurfaced on Tianya and wrote: ""I, more than anyone else, would like to bring the real perpetrator to justice."" Online campaign for 'justice' Last Friday, with discussion on the Zhu case reaching fever pitch, Weibo started censoring the topic by blocking keywords like ""Zhu Ling"" and ""thallium."" The site's action only added fuel to the fire over the continued official silence, especially about whether Sun had any role in the crime. On the same day, a ""Y.Z."" from Miami created a petition on the White House's official website, naming Sun -- whose English name is Jasmine -- as the prime suspect in the poisoning case and accusing her of committing marriage fraud to enter the United States. The petition calls for the U.S. government to investigate and deport her ""to protect the safety of our citizens."" In less than four days, more than 130,000 people had signed the petition. Anyone can petition the U.S. federal government online to take action on an issue. According to terms posted on the White House website, a petition must reach 100,000 signatures within 30 days to require a response. ""It's extraordinary to seek another country's help to address a domestic judicial issue,"" Yao Bo, a Beijing-based political commentator, told CNN. ""But if your own government ignores you, I think it's reasonable to see people feel compelled to seek outside pressure to ensure judicial fairness and transparency in their own country."" Other observers oppose what they view as a cyber witch-hunt for Sun. ""The law is about evidence -- you can't convict someone without evidence and not everything is a conspiracy,"" a U.S.-based user wrote on his Weibo page. ""Petitioning the White House without evidence is the ultimate fail -- those people really don't understand the law or American politics."" Zhu's mother speaks out . Weibo has lifted its short-lived ban on the discussion of the Zhu case, as her 72-year-old mother was interviewed by a talk show host on China National Radio on Monday . Recounting her experience of being stonewalled by the police over the years, Zhu Mingxin said the government has rejected the family's request to make the investigation results public. ""I will continue to apply,"" she said. ""I hope to have an answer. I hope to give Zhu Ling an answer."" ""Zhu Ling is my child and she is a good child,"" she added. ""In the prime of her youth, she almost lost her life and she's been miserable since. I hate the perpetrator."" Such heart-wrenching words have resonated with the public, prompting many of the so-called ""Weibo stars"" with millions of followers to retweet Zhu's story and appeal for help. Websites set up by Zhu's supporters home and abroad are attracting new donations for her parents, whose entire lives now focus on caring for their ailing daughter. Will public attention bring action? Even the official Xinhua news agency has jumped into the fray, mentioning Sun's ""unusual family background"" and challenging the police to speak up about the case with concrete evidence in a widely circulated article published Monday. ""Whether or not to re-open the investigation depends on new evidence, but the Beijing police should take a meaningful step forward by breaking their silence,"" opined the Southern Metropolitan Daily newspaper on its official Weibo page. ""Doing so would help not only the victim but also the alleged suspect as well as the police's own credibility."" ""In the past few years, people have seen too much injustice in stories posted online -- and the political power's wanton interference in the judicial system,"" said Yao, the commentator. ""Things just erupted when Zhu's case resurfaced."" For Zhu's parents, however, the latest wave of public attention changes little for their daughter. ""I used to hope for a miracle,"" Zhu's mother said on the radio show. ""Now that it's been so long, I just hope to see her conditions improve.""","Zhu Ling was studying at Tsinghua University in 1994 when she was poisoned .

"(CNN) -- The Republican Party is in the midst of a historic debate over what role it will play in immigration reform. Should the GOP change course and support a path to citizenship for some 11 million unauthorized immigrants, hoping this will reverse the party's declining fortunes among Hispanics, the fast-growing group of voters? Or should it double down on its opposition to reform, kill the legislation and hope to hang on by strengthening loyalty among a declining share of white voters? While all the attention has been focused on what to do about the southern border with Mexico, Republicans would be well-advised to take a careful look north. In Canada, the Conservative Party, which lost two of every three elections to the Liberals during the 20th century, has turned the tables by embracing immigration and reaching out to Canada's immigrant communities. There is no reason Republicans cannot do the same. I lived in Canada for many years, as an immigrant from the United States growing up in Vancouver and then as a newspaper reporter for several publications. Throughout my time in Canada, the Liberal Party was the party supported by most immigrants. Under a series of leaders, most notably Pierre Trudeau and Jean Chretien, the Liberals formed an unbeatable coalition based on French-speaking voters from Quebec and the rapidly growing immigrant population in the big cities of Toronto and Vancouver. Mostly white Conservative voters from the heartland grumbled and called for more provincial autonomy, but their party was usually relegated to the opposition benches in Ottawa. Under Prime Minister Stephen Harper, however, Conservatives have turned that landscape upside down. In Canada's 2011 election, the Conservatives outpolled the Liberals decisively among voters who weren't born in Canada, a historic transformation that was the result of a strategic decision by Harper during the 2000s to reach out to Canada's immigrant communities. The party, which won a minority government in 2006, made small gestures such as reducing the arrival fee for immigrants, and larger historical ones such asapologizing and compensating descendants for the notorious Chinese ""head tax"" levied to discourage Chinese immigration in the 19th century. In the 2011 campaign, Conservatives also promised targeted tax cuts for families that appealed to suburban immigrants, recruited more minority candidates than any other party and ran campaign ads in Mandarin, Punjabi, Cantonese and other languages. Of the 23 seats picked up by the Tories, 20 were in the greater Toronto region and none had an immigrant population of less than 30%. Just a decade ago, in the 2000 election, the Liberal Party had won more than 60% of the immigrant vote. The 2011 election was no fluke either. The Conservative Party has increased its share of the overall popular vote in each of the past four elections. The chief architect of this shift was an Energizer bunny named Jason Kenney, who looks like he walked out of a meeting of the young campus Republicans. In nearly five years as Canada's minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism (yes, that's ""Multiculturalism"" with a capital M), Kenney has spent almost every weekend in immigrant constituencies attending parties, visiting temples and mosques, and embracing, sometimes literally, thousands of recent immigrants. ""People from the communities like to touch you, to embrace you, to hug you, and physical contact isn't my strong suit,"" he told Maclean's magazine recently. Kenney has not only embraced immigrant communities, he has championed immigration policy as a tool of Canadian economic development. Indeed, if the Republicans were looking for an actual policy on immigration rather than just saying no to the Democrats, Kenney and the Conservatives are creating a more market-driven, decentralized scheme that could be a model for the GOP. Under the Tories, who won a majority in 2011, Canada is trying to overhaul its immigration system to increase benefits to the Canadian economy. The country's historic ""points system,"" in which the government selected immigrants based on a set of broad skills such as education, work experience and language, has not worked very well in choosing immigrants who succeed in the job market. So the Conservative government is creating a new scheme, modeled after successes in Australia and New Zealand, in which the credentials and language skills of immigrants will be assessed by an independent third party, and those who pass muster will become part of a pool of potential immigrants to Canada that is available to employers. But they won't get on the plane until they have a job offer. The provinces, too, are playing a bigger a role in immigrant selection, unlike the U.S. states which have no say at all. That has gradually shifted new immigrants away from the overcrowded cities to the sparsely populated Prairies and the Maritime provinces, where immigration provides a bigger economic boost. At a speech to the Tory faithful after the 2011 election, Kenney said the Conservatives had proved it was possible to create ""a new durable and diverse Conservative electorate"" based on ""values like freedom, enterprise and hard work, personal responsibility, equal opportunity, and respect for law and order, family, faith and tradition."" While many in the GOP believe a similar message could sell the party to immigrants here, the Republicans remain focused on not rewarding any of the roughly 11 million immigrants living illegally in the United States. That led to Mitt Romney's support for ""self-deportation,"" which appealed to primary voters but sent immigrants fleeing to the Democrats in the general election. While Canada does not have the same illegal immigration problem, the Tories did face the same dilemma reaching out to immigrants while holding on to white voters who see Canada's immigration system as far too porous. The response was to crack down on the refugee admittance scheme, which was rife with fraud, and to tighten immigration rules in other areas as well. Conservatives showed that toughness on immigration policy could go hand-in-hand with welcoming immigrants. While it has been a balancing act, the Conservatives have so far pulled it off brilliantly. ""Canadians of all backgrounds are drawn to our party,"" Kenney said, ""not in spite of our values, but because of them."" That sounds like a slogan for the GOP -- if anyone is paying attention. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Edward Alden.","Edward Alden: GOP in the midst of historic debate on immigration reform .

"(CNN) -- The latest piece in Banksy's monthlong street art residency in New York went up for online auction Tuesday with a starting minimum bid of $74,000. The famously anonymous British graffiti artist's website describes it as ""The banality of the banality of evil, Oil on oil on canvas, 2013,"" and ""a thrift store painting vandalized then re-donated to the thrift store."" The painting depicts a countryside landscape featuring a large lake, trees with autumn colors, and snowy mountains in the background. The one outlier is an officer on a bench in the foreground with what appears to be a Nazi symbol stitched to his right sleeve. The painting was dropped off at the Housing Works auction shop in New York's Gramercy area on Tuesday morning by an anonymous person, according to James Barnes, a Housing Works sales associate. ""It was by surprise,"" Barnes said, ""We just found out a couple of hours ago that it was actually a Banksy painting."" Every day this month, Banksy has been unveiling new works of art around New York. The works are then announced on his website and posted to Instagram.

"(CNN) -- Nigeria's music industry is flourishing. However, it faces a big threat -- the scourge of piracy. But the tide is changing, say the country's top music stars, who are stepping up efforts to reform the industry and are putting pressure on the government to crackdown on pirates. One of Nigeria's most celebrated artists is among those calling for action to stamp out the problem. ""Piracy is still a very massive issue because there is no control in terms of producing the CDs and no barcodes. You don't even know where it is coming from,"" said hip-hop and RnB star Innocent Idibia, popularly known as 2Face. Idibia is no stranger to the international scene and his music has won him a string of awards both at home and abroad. But while he has been recognized for his work he feels that back home there is a lack of respect for artists and that the police do not view piracy as a serious crime. ""A policeman might be standing here, someone might be selling pirated copies over there and he wouldn't even look at it as though someone is committing a crime and he might even buy one!"" he said. ""They love the music, they want to listen to it, they dance to it, they buy the pirated copies, but the respect for the actual intellectual property is not there,"" he continued. Only a decade ago, there were only one or two compact disc production plants. Today there are 28 in operation and the country has its own copyright commission, the Nigerian Copyright Commission (NCC). According to the latest Strategic Action Against Piracy report released in 2011 from the NCC, piracy of CDs, VCDs, DVDs cost just over $3.5 million a year. But despite the increase in popularity and availability of discs, the CEO of one of West Africa's leading media and entertainment companies thinks piracy is hindering the country's success on the international stage. ""When the international majors were in Nigeria they never invested in the back end of the industry, so there is no formal distribution in place,"" said Obi Asika, founder of Storm 360. ""There needs to be major investment into distribution and we are speaking to some of the major fulfillment companies,"" he continued. ""The key issue is that Nigerian businesses need to recognize that this is a significant opportunity which might be worth over a couple of billion dollars a year."" Nigeria's YouTube poet . Asika believes that the mobile industry could be the key place to push African music legitimately. He is helping to launch Spinlet, a music download service going live in December. ""We have over 90 million mobiles in Nigeria and over 40 million are in the youth space. The key issues facing the industry are the need to build a proper touring platform, a live scene, and also for major companies and government to begin to pay for the use of music across all platforms,"" he said. ""We think Spinlet will make a major impact in terms of getting real revenues back to artists, labels, producers and managers returns on their music,"" he added. Last year the industry decided to close ranks and establish the Copyright Society of Nigeria (COSON) to give advice to artists about copyright and licensing their music. The collective also promotes the rights of artists and acts as an industry watchdog. The NCC and COSON are backing Storm 360 to release an anti-piracy song early next year as part of a wider national campaign. Asika hopes that artists like 2Face will get involved to help educate music fans about the problem of piracy. ""Education, communication, campaign -- if you do not educate people you cannot expect them to know there is a real problem,"" he said. Idibia says the issue of piracy is even more aggravating considering the difficulties Nigerian artists face in getting their music to market. He compares the emergence of artists in Africa to ""rose flowers growing from rocks."" But he says the good thing about the African music scene is artists are not afraid to speak up for what they believe in, which could help improve their rights. ""The trend is we get ourselves involved in everything that affects our lives and we speak out. We talk about it,"" he said.","Music piracy in Nigeria is a widespread problem .

"(CNN) -- An Australian swim coach has tough love for his compatriots in the Olympics this year: ""We're getting too soft. Our work ethic has dropped down."" Ken Wood, the swim coach who helped train China's double gold winner Ye Shiwen, one of the Olympic surprises this year, said the Australians ""cannot afford to be soft"" to compete with Chinese swimmers. Wood, a three-time Olympic coach with 40 years of experience, questioned the work ethic of Aussie athletes, saying those in London seemed to be more interested in socializing. ""They're running their mobile phones, Twittering and Facebook and everything else,"" Wood said. ""It was more of a carnival atmosphere."" Australia, usually a swimming powerhouse, is grappling with a disappointing showing in the London Games this year, compared with its Beijing performance in 2008. Wood has coached swimmers and record breakers such as Australia's Leisel Jones and Geoff Huegill. He first started coaching Ye when she was 14 years old. China has a system that identifies promising young talent between the ages of seven and 12, he said. He called the unfounded allegations of doping surrounding Ye as ""absolute rubbish."" ""A lot of the credit has to go to Ye Shiwen's Chinese coach. He's done a great job with her,"" Wood said. And the rising Chinese dominance in swimming is unlikely to fade, he added. ""It's not a matter of if China is going to be No. 1 in swimming nation, it's just when they will be,"" Wood said. As of Thursday, Australia is 11th in the medal rankings, with 5 golds, 12 silvers and 9 bronze. Australia had finished the Beijing games with 14 gold medals and in 6th place in the medal rankings. Australian media has bemoaned the country's performance, and the fact that the swimming nation has won one gold in the pool this Olympics. It has inspired a review of Australia's swimming program, headed by former national head coach Bill Sweetenham and Olympian Suzie O'Neill. Swimming legend Ian Thorpe has suggested that less funding for sports could be one of the factors contributing to the country's lacklustre showing. ""I think it would be great if we actually have a debate about this in Australia and actually talk about what the next 20 years of sport will look like. Sport needs to be included in the health budget,"" said the five-time gold medal winner. London Olympics: Where is Australia? Some Australian athletes have been pushing back on the criticism about their lack of gold medals in London. ""It's bloody hard to make an Olympics final, let alone get a medal,"" said Sally Pearson, who won silver in Beijing and also set a new Olympic record in a gold-winning performance in the 100m hurdles on Wednesday. ""I think it's quite silly saying silver and bronze don't get counted in a medal tally, because it feels like they're not worth anything and they certainly are."" She said she was ""disappointed"" by the response back home. ""To say that silver's not good enough -- it's rubbish,"" Pearson said. Addressing the criticism of the Aussie team, she said: ""We've come together as a really strong team. We're like a little family. I don't think anyone really feels we've done so badly, because we're so proud of everyone.""

"Washington (CNN) -- The nation's airlines asked a federal court on Friday to stop the imminent furlough of air traffic controllers, saying the cuts could delay 6,700 flights daily with passengers waiting up to four hours in some cases. The Federal Aviation Administration is beginning the furloughs on Sunday as part of government-wide spending cuts that took effect in March due to inaction by Congress on a plan to cut the deficit. The FAA said the impact of the furloughs could be felt as early as Monday. Furloughs are hitting other agencies as well. While both sides agree furloughs would lead to substantial flight delays, the FAA and the airlines disagree on whether they are necessary. The FAA says it must furlough all 47,000 of its employees, including 15,000 air traffic controllers, as part of $637 million in planned spending cuts by September 30, the end of the government's fiscal year. The FAA's annual budget is $16 billion. ""We cannot avoid furloughs,"" Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said this week. But the airlines said that step is ""based on a false legal premise -- that Congress has required the precise cuts that (the FAA has) ordered. However, the Budget Control Act does nothing of the sort,"" the airlines argued in court papers. The agency could cut elsewhere and spare the traveling public the acute pain it will feel when controllers stay home, the carriers said. The motion was filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia by Airlines for America, the trade association representing major airlines, the Regional Airline Association, and the Air Line Pilots Association, a group representing unionized pilots. They are challenging the FAA, which oversees air traffic operations and aviation safety in the United States, and its parent agency, the Transportation Department. The airlines said it would push for congressional legislation deeming air controllers ""essential"" employees, which would exempt them from furloughs. It has asked the Obama administration for a 30-day delay of its furlough action so it could pursue the matter with Congress. ""We continue to believe that the FAA has other means to reach a 10 percent budget reduction than to impact the traveling public,"" A4A President Nick Calio said in a statement. ""When a company needs to make a 10 percent budget reduction, the answer is not to make it is so inefficient that no one wants to do business with it anymore. That's essentially what the FAA is proposing,"" he said. A coalition of aviation associations also has called on the White House to give the FAA funding flexibility. ""While other federal agencies, such as the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), Customs and Border Protection (CPB), Meat Inspectors (USDA) and Bureau of Prisons (DOJ), have taken steps to avoid furloughing their essential operational personnel, the FAA believes they have not been given the same flexibility,"" the group wrote in a letter to White House chief of staff Denis McDonough.","Airlines seek court intervention to halt planned furloughs of air traffic controllers .

"Abuja, Nigeria (CNN) -- Three church bombings and retaliatory attacks in northern Nigeria killed at least 50 people Sunday and injured more than 130 others, the Nigerian Red Cross Society said. The series of attacks began when a suicide bomber drove at high speed through a barricade at the EWCA Goodnews Wusasa Zaria church around 9 a.m., congregation member Lucy Bello said. That blast left at least 24 people dead and 125 injured, some in critical condition, according to a Kaduna state government official who asked to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to speak to the media. The Nigerian Red Cross Society, however, reported that two people were killed and 22 injured in the attack. Bello, who had bruises from the explosion, said the dead and wounded were thrown to the ground by the blast. Within minutes, another explosion occurred at the Christ the King Catholic Church in Zaria, according to the National Emergency Management Agency. At least 10 people were killed in that attack and more than 50 were injured, the state government official said. Again, the Nigerian Red Cross Society offered a conflicting report, saying that 16 people were killed and 31 injured in that attack. Later, at least 10 people were killed in a bombing at a church in the city of Kaduna, Red Cross spokesman Andronicus Adeyemo said. Christian youths in Zaria and Kaduna reacted violently, burning tires and blocking major roads. The Kaduna state government imposed a 24-hour curfew. Thirty-two people were killed and 78 injured in the third blast, including victims of the reprisal attacks, the Nigerian Red Cross Society said. The bombings are the latest in a string of violence directed at churches. A week ago, a car bomb killed five people during services at a church in Jos, also in northern Nigeria. Angry crowds wielding makeshift clubs fought with police after chasing security forces away from the destroyed church. Three more people died in the clashes. And two weeks ago, two church bombings in the region killed at least 15 people. No one immediately took responsibility for Sunday's attacks, though Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan suggested they were the work of Boko Haram, a militant Islamist group. ""We will not let Boko Haram intimidate our Christian community or police officers. We will fight these terrorists until there are none left,"" he wrote on Twitter page Sunday. Boko Haram has previously carried out attacks, including at churches. The group also refers to itself as the ""Nigerian Taliban"" and seeks to overthrow the government and replace it with a regime based on Islamic law. ""Boko Haram"" means ""Western education is forbidden.""

"(CNN) -- Alex Ferguson's decision to step down as Manchester United manager after more than a quarter of a century in charge leaves the club's hierarchy with the unenviable task of replacing the Scot, given his phenomenal success at Old Trafford. Ferguson has won more than 30 trophies, including 13 English league championships and two European Cups. It is a record that most managers might wilt under given the level of expectation that will inevitably accompany Ferguson's successor. ""It's impossible to emulate Ferguson and deliver what he has done,"" according to former Monaco technical director and chief executive Tor-Kristian Karlsen. ""The brief for manager is to keep winning trophies. But United want to re-establish themselves as the No. 1 club in the world and they are a long way from that,"" Karlsen told CNN. ""The club is a massive worldwide brand and is now judged on its European performance. On a worldwide basis the Champions League is the Holy Grail. ""Perhaps the one criticism that could be made of the current squad is that it doesn't have a Lionel Messi, a Cristiano Ronaldo or a Radamel Falcao."" Jose Mourinho and David Moyes are two of the potential candidates in the frame to fill Ferguson's shoes -- CNN profiles the duo below and asks Karlsen to give a boardroom view on the two men's chances at Old Trafford. David Moyes . Mourinho has been heavily backed to succeed Ferguson despite hinting at a return to Chelsea, but Everton manager David Moyes is the favorite to take over from the 71-year-old Scot. Appointed by the Liverpool-based club in March 2002, Moyes is very much in the Ferguson mold. Both were born in Glasgow, though Ferguson played for Rangers while Moyes featured for city rivals Celtic at the start of his playing career. The steely-eyed, taciturn Moyes is now the third longest-serving manager in the English Premier League, behind Ferguson and Arsenal's Arsene Wenger. Despite a lack of financial resources, Everton have consistently exceeded expectations under Moyes and in 2005 the club qualified for the Champions League, while also reaching the FA Cup final four years later. Prior to joining Everton, Moyes managed Preston North End, winning promotion from the third tier of English football to the brink of the Premier League. The question mark against the 50-year-old is that he has never won any of the three major English trophies -- the Premier League, the FA Cup and the League Cup. Remarkably his Everton side has never been able to win at Manchester United, Chelsea, Arsenal or Liverpool in 44 attempts. His record in the transfer market is mixed. While Marouane Fellaini and Kevin Mirallas have been notable successes, the likes of Per Kroldrup, Andy van der Meyde and Andy Johnson were underwhelming acquisitions. How would he cope with a bigger budget and better players at his disposal? There is also the question of Moyes' relationship with one of United's star players -- Wayne Rooney. In 2008, the Everton manager accepted ""substantial"" undisclosed libel damages when he sued Rooney, his co-author Hunter Davies and HarperCollins, the publishers of ""Wayne Rooney -- My Story So Far,"" following allegations that he leaked details of a confidential conversation with the player. A year later Rooney phoned Moyes personally to apologize. If the United board do plump for Moyes, they will not have to pay any compensation as the Scot's Everton contract runs out at the end of the season and no agreement has been reached over a new deal. Karlsen's verdict: ""Moyes is the favorite, but I think he is the conservative option. ""If Moyes is appointed, the club would be in good hands. He's a balanced and sensible option. ""I don't think he would have a problem in taking charge of a club of United's size. He would also have the advantage of Ferguson potentially mentoring him. ""On the flip side, there is Moyes' lack of European experience. There is also the lack of experience of working with star players. The bigger the ego, the harder they are to manage -- that is a special art. ""Having said that, Moyes deserves a big job -- arguably it wasn't realistic for Everton to qualify for the Champions League."" Jose Mourinho . Over the last few weeks the coach of Spanish club Real Madrid has been strongly linked with a return to the English Premier League as his old team Chelsea seeks to replace interim manager Rafael Benitez. Mourinho offers the complete package as manager -- an unparalleled track record of success allied to an ability to motivate players that inspires loyalty long after he has moved on to new teams. He has the knack of getting journalists to eat out of his hands as he delivers a succession of quotable quotes. No coach gives better press conferences than Mourinho, evidenced by his pre-match briefing ahead of Real's game with Malaga this week as he skilfully squashed criticism from one of his own players and defiantly gave away no clues about his future. However, given he is the only coach to win European football's top three leagues, Mourinho's time at the Bernabeu has been mixed. The 50-year-old Portuguese has won one La Liga title, last season, but looks set to miss out to archrivals Barcelona this time around. He has also guided Real to a Spanish Cup win, while his team will play city rivals Atletico in this year's final. But Mourinho's quest to win the European Champions League for a third time in his career has faltered at Real, losing in the semifinals for three years in a row -- last month being beaten 4-3 on aggregate by German club Borussia Dortmund. Mourinho has made no secret of his desire to return to England, with media reports claiming he has already negotiated a return to Chelsea at the end of the season. His previous spell in charge saw him lead the Blues to their first top-flight title for 55 years in 2005. He won five trophies in his three seasons in London. Mourinho forged his reputation when his Porto side famously knocked Manchester United out of the European Cup at Old Trafford in 2004, running down the touchline to celebrate the late clinching goal. Porto went on to win the Champions League that year. After Porto and then Chelsea, Mourinho coached Inter Milan, winning the Champions League, the Italian league title and the Italian Cup in his second and final season with the club, before leaving to join Real. But with that unimpeachable track record of success, comes volatility. As well as the incendiary media conferences, Mourinho has occasionally overstepped the mark -- no more so than in his 2011 altercation with the now Barcelona manager Tito Vilanova, when the Portuguese coach poked his opponent in the eye when the Catalan was Pep Guardiola's assistant. ""I'm there to win,"" Mourinho, who often refers to Ferguson as ""The Boss"", told CNN last year as he reflected on his coaching philosophy. ""I'm there with my team to try to win. I'm there and I live the game, I live the match as if it was the last match of my career. ""So people look at me and they see what they see. After that, in press conferences, it's the other place where people know me. ""In press conferences, there is still a match to play. Before the match, press conference is pre-match and after the match, press conference is post-match, but it's a match."" Karlsen's verdict: ""Mourinho is the ideal candidate. He is the only manager who can offer you a guarantee of success. ""With a manager with a lesser profile, if the next season doesn't start well then they will come under immense pressure. ""But given Mourinho's track record no-one can criticize Mourinho. He has proven that he could work under the most intense pressure. ""That is the biggest threat to a manager -- the environment that they are working in -- and when the pressure becomes too much, you become reactive rather than sticking to the plan. ""You would never have that problem with Mourinho. ""As for whether Mourinho's combative personality would damage the United 'brand,' he is clever enough to tone it down. Don't forget that Ferguson often thrived on conflict as a way of putting pressure on United's opponents. ""The United job is a role where your persona is almost as important as your man-management skills -- it is about the statement that you make. ""Mourinho fits the bill. He has that charisma that made Ferguson so special.""","Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson is retiring after 26 years in charge .

"SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- Ssangyong Motor Co., South Korea's fifth largest automaker, filed for bankruptcy Friday, citing the company's worsening finances. About 800 unionized workers rally at a Ssangyong Motor plant in Pyeongtaek, South Korea, on December 30. Ssangyong is seeking court receivership and filed its application for protection from creditors with the Seoul Central District Court, the company said in a statement. During reorganization, Ssangyong plans to cut costs through voluntary retirement and paid leave, according to the statement. Ssangyong is the South Korean unit of China's Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp., which holds a 51 percent share in the company. Ssangyong has been battered by the global financial downturn and credit crunch like many other automakers. A large portion of the company's profits used to come from SUVs, which was hurt by high gas prices earlier in the year before the credit crunch additionally cut into sales. Last year vehicle sales at Ssangyong dropped nearly 30 percent, the Yonhap news agency reported.","Ssangyong plans to cut costs through voluntary retirement, paid leave .

"(CNN) -- The common flu rarely kills the young and healthy, but the Schwolert family knows it can. Their 17-year-old son Max felt ill on December 22 as the family drove to Wisconsin for Christmas vacation, beginning a series of ups and downs that would ultimately claim his life. At first, Max took Tylenol for his symptoms: a mild fever and nausea. He woke up the next morning feeling well enough to play in the snow with his two sisters. His family endearingly called him ""Panda,"" for his gentle nature and 6' 4"" height. Flu picks up steam across the United States . The next day, Christmas Eve, Max stayed home with a cough while his family attended church. The extra bed rest seemed to help. By Christmas day, Max felt better again, even participating in the family festivities. But later that night he took a turn for worse and never got better. ""He woke up very sick,"" said Tom Schwolert, Max's father. ""He had an excessive 104.9 fever, and we could not break it,"" said Max's mother Melanie. The Schwolerts took their son to the local hospital where he tested positive for the flu. ""Within 30 minutes the doctor was like, 'Something's really wrong here. His kidneys are starting to fail. His blood pressure is really low,' "" Tom remembered. Max had to be helicoptered to Regions Hospital in St. Paul, Minnesota, but there was no room on the flight for family. Max's mother had to say good-bye to her sick son and drive separately. That ""broke my heart,"" she said. ""He looked at me and there were some tears rolling down his face. He said 'Mom, I'm scared.' I said, 'I know buddy, I am too.' And then he saw me crying. He said, 'Mom it's going to be OK, you're going to be OK, I love you. And that's really the last coherent thing he said to me."" Max spent four days intubated in the intensive care unit at Regions. A staph bacterial infection soon led to septic shock. By December 29, Max was dead.

"(CNN) -- The jubilation over the freeing of three women and a girl from their alleged captivity in Cleveland is quickly giving way to a serious question: Did Cleveland police miss clues? How could Amanda Berry, Georgina DeJesus and Michelle Knight remain captive for about decade in a densely populated area within a few miles of where each of them disappeared? The women were freed this week with the help of neighbors. The man who lived in the home where the alleged captives were found, Ariel Castro, was charged Wednesday with four counts of kidnapping and three counts of rape, Cleveland chief assistant prosecutor Victor Perez said. Prosecutors are not pressing charges against Pedro and Onil Castro, who were also arrested along with their brother Ariel, with Perez saying there's ""no evidence"" that they were complicit in the case. Neighbors say they had called police about suspicious activity at the home in the past. Cleveland police deny that, issuing a statement Wednesday saying that a ""thorough review of police communications records"" show no such calls ever took place. Police say they went to the address once in 2000, before the alleged kidnappings, when Castro reported a fight outside his home, and in 2004, after two of the three women had disappeared. The latter visit was unrelated to the kidnappings, police said. Child services requested that visit to investigate a complaint that Castro had left a child alone on a bus during the time he worked as a bus driver. No one answered the door at the home, and investigators later interviewed him elsewhere, police say. Martin Flask, director of public safety for the city, later told reporters that ""there is no evidence to indicate that any of them (the women) were ever outside in the yard in chains, without clothing or any other manner."" Timeline: From missing to liberated . Neighbors say they reported suspicious activity . Neighbor Nina Samoylicz says that in July 2010, she and her friends saw a naked woman in the backyard of Castro's home. They said something to her, and Castro ""told her to get down. So we said something to him. He told her to get in the house,"" and then he went inside as well, Samoylicz said. ""We called the cops,"" she says. ""They thought we were playing and joking; they didn't believe us."" But Faliceonna Lopez, Samoylicz's sister, told CNN's ""Piers Morgan Live"" Tuesday night that they called their mother, not the police. Their mother, Annita Lugo, did not contact authorities because, she said, she didn't know what to do. Within a week or two after they saw the naked woman, tarps went up, shielding the backyard from onlookers, Nina Samoylicz said. Samoylicz also said she saw a girl who would sit looking out an open window until Castro would come along and board it back up. Sometimes the girl played at a nearby park by herself. ""My cousin one day said something to her. She said she's waiting for her dad and then she pointed to (Castro). And she ran up to him, and gave him a hug, and they left."" Neighbor feels 'fooled' by abduction suspect . Police say the girl is Berry's daughter. News reports say another neighbor called police after seeing a woman through an attic window of the home, which Castro never allowed neighbors to enter. And another neighbor, Israel Lugo -- Annita Lugo's brother -- says he called police in 2011 when he heard yelling in the Castro home. Officers came a half-hour later, knocked on the door about 20 times over a 10-minute span, then left after no one answered the door, Lugo says. Yet Cleveland police took to Twitter on Wednesday afternoon to dispute such claims. After an ""extensive"" look at its records, Cleveland police said there were no calls to the Castro house ""for women held or women banging on windows."" While denying any tips in the past, authorities are reaching out now to try to get more information about Ariel Castro and his home, in the hopes it can help their investigation. ""We continue to ask the community to send tips and information -- to say something if you see something. We cannot do this alone,"" police said in a statement after the women were freed. Some people in the neighborhood, including Charles Ramsey, the man who helped free the alleged captives, say they don't recall seeing anything suspicious at Castro's home. But legal analysts are taking the police to task. If someone really heard screaming and police simply knocked on the door and left without further investigation, then ""law enforcement clearly dropped the ball,"" attorney Lisa Bloom said on CNN's ""Piers Morgan Live."" ""It was almost like a Keystone Cops situation,"" prominent attorney Mark Geragos added. ""There's got to be much more to this story. Given my experience in handling criminal cases, I can't believe that we're not going to find in the days ahead or the weeks ahead much more that unravels about this that blows your mind."" Deputy Police Chief Ed Tomba, at a press conference Wednesday, said investigators over the past 10 years have often asked themselves whether they missed a significant angle. The answer, he said, is no. ""I'm just very confident in the ability of those investigators and those law enforcement officers that they checked every single lead and if there was one bit of evidence, one shred of a tip, no matter how minute it was, they followed it up very, very aggressively."" CNN's Tory Dunnan contributed to this report.","NEW: Ariel Castro is charged with kidnapping, rape; his brothers are not .

"Sanford, Florida (CNN) -- A case involving the fatal shooting of an unarmed Florida teen, which has sparked outrage and calls for justice, is in the hands of the state attorney's office. Police say Trayvon Martin, 17, was returning from the convenience store to the home of his father's fiancee in a gated community in Sanford, Florida, around sunset on February 26. A neighborhood watch captain, George Zimmerman, 28, saw the teen and called 911 to report a suspicious man, authorities said. The 911 dispatcher told Zimmerman not to confront Martin, but by the time police arrived, the teenager lay dead with a gunshot wound in the chest, said Bill Lee, the Sanford police chief. He was carrying a small amount of cash, some candy and an iced tea. Zimmerman told police he shot Martin in self defense, authorities said. ""When you add it up, it just doesn't even make sense,"" said Ben Crump, the Martin family's attorney. ""Trayvon Martin, a kid, has a bag of Skittles. (Zimmerman) had a 9 mm gun. Trayvon Martin didn't approach George Zimmerman, George Zimmerman approached Trayvon Martin. So how can he now assert self defense?"" A gunshot can be heard on the 911 calls recorded that night, police said. The Martin family has sought to make the tapes available, but State Attorney Norm Wolfinger said Tuesday the calls will not be made public until the investigation is complete. ""Trayvon Martin and his family, interested persons, and the public-at-large are entitled to no less than a through, deliberate and just review of the information provided, along with any other evidence that may or may not be developed in the course of the review process,"" Wolfinger's office said in a statement. ""We intend to honor that commitment."" The shooting has sparked an outrage in the community, with some accusing Zimmerman, who is white, of profiling the black teenager. iReporter: 'Unconscious racism' behind shooting? Numerous CNN attempts to contact Zimmerman were unsuccessful, and it is unclear whether he has retained an attorney. Police said they have not charged him because there are no grounds to disprove his story of what happened. ""The evidence and testimony we have so far does not establish that Mr. Zimmerman did not act in self defense. We don't have anything to dispute his claim of self-defense, at this point, with the evidence and testimony that we have,"" Lee said. Lee said the 911 directions asking Zimmerman not to confront the teenager are not mandatory instructions. ""That is a call taker making a recommendation to him. He's not under a legal obligation to do that, so that is not something we can charge him with,"" he said. "" But it would have been a good outcome ... if Trayvon Martin and George Zimmerman never came in contact with one another."" In a letter sent to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, the NAACP expressed doubt in the Sanford Police Department and asked the Department of Justice to review the case. ""The NAACP has no confidence that, absent federal oversight, the Sanford Police Department will devote the necessary degree of care to its investigation. We therefore call upon you to detail personnel to Sanford immediately to review the facts, ensure that the Sanford Police Department conducts an impartial, thorough and prompt investigation of the circumstances involving the death of this unarmed teen, and ensure that the responsible person is held accountable if a crime was committed,"" the letter said.","Trayvon Martin, 17, is fatally shot during a neighborhood watch .

"(AOL Autos) -- Well, it was bound to happen. The high-tech arms race has escalated once again. No, we're not talking about military weaponry. It all started with the radar guns used by police officers to detect speeders. We're talking about the tech-driven cat-and-mouse game between law-enforcement agencies and motorists when it comes to setting and avoiding speed traps. It all started, of course, with the radar guns used by police officers to detect speeders. Then came radar detectors used by motorists who wanted to skedaddle faster than posted speed limits. Then police began using laser units which are more effective and more accurate than radar guns and so on and so on. Now, the latest ""upgrade"" in this ongoing game of high-tech one-upmanship: Trapster. Trapster is a service developed and run by Pete Tenereillo of Carlsbad, California, and is essentially a cell-phone social network that allows motorists to hook up with one another for the purpose of issuing real-time alerts about the location of speed traps. Trapster works like this: Go to the Web site, and sign up for a free membership. Then download the Trapster software to your cell phone or PDA. Tenereillo said that most current-generation cell phones, Blackberries and other PDA's can accommodate the Trapster software. Then, you're ready to hit the road. And once you're tooling down the highway, if you spot a state trooper or city cop lying in wait with a radar gun or laser unit, you just need to punch in ""pound one"" on your cell phone -- or dial a toll-free number. Other users are then alerted on their cell phones or PDA when they approach the same speed trap. ""One great thing about that is that it's hands-free,"" says Tenereillo. ""You don't have to be looking at the phone or even be holding it to be notified of the speed trap -- which, of course, is safer, because you don't have to take your eyes off the road to be notified of the trap."" The more sophisticated cell phones/PDAs can also display a map that displays the exact location of the speed trap. ""But obviously, people should pull over if they're going to look at the map,"" Tenereillo added. Trapster was launched in April, and while Tenereillo declined to comment on the exact number of subscribers, he did say the site is booming. ""We're going crazy, we've had so many people sign up that it's been hard to keep up with,"" he said. ""We initially had some capacity issues as a result, so we had to re-do some of the architecture."" Tenereillo said one thing that surprised him is that ""about half of our initial subscribers were soccer moms. But, when you think about it, that makes sense, they're in the car the most, and they take a lot of short trips, driving their kids to and from school, soccer practice, music lessons, etcetera -- so they're the ones getting the worst tickets, like for driving 53 [mph] in a 35 [mph] zone. Those are worse tickets than the ones you get out on the highway because judges show no mercy when it comes to speeding in residential neighborhoods or adjacent surface streets."" In May, Trapster also became integrated with Dash Navigation Inc., an Internet-connected GPS device for vehicles that can be mounted on the dashboard. Trapster relies partly on the WiFi technology provided Skyhook Wireless Inc., a Boston-based firm that provides positioning services that depend on various WiFi access points. It also relies in part on satellite-based Global Positioning Systems. ""The reason that Skyhook is a great partner for us is that, if you have a handset that only has GPS, that takes a few minutes after you turn it on before it gets a fix on the location of a speed trap,"" says Tenereillo. ""But Skyhook's WiFi technology is instantaneous; it can tell you immediately if there is a cop with a radar gun in your vicinity."" ""Pete needed to get Trapster into as many handsets as possible, as many different types of phones and PDAs as he could, in order to build a large interactive social network,"" Ted Morgan, Skybook's CEO, explained. ""A big challenge for a service like Trapster is that it requires the phone to know its own location. So, by integrating our technology, it enabled Trapster to expand the potential pool of phones they could get service onto. ""We take advantage of the fact that there are WiFi access points almost everywhere in populated areas -- homes, offices, Starbucks stores, etc,"" Morgan said. ""We have crews that go out and survey every street, we've covered over a million miles of road, which covers 70 percent of the population. We've now mapped over 40 million access points."" As mentioned, Trapster also relies in part on satellite-based GPS, but using GPS alone is not enough to ensure ""total coverage"" for a system like Trapster, Morgan said. ""Our WiFi system works in a way that is similar to GPS, except that, instead of using satellites, we use the WiFi signals that permeate through most populated areas. GPS has some limitations, in that the cell phone manufacturer has to add it to the phone, and GPS also does not work as well in crowded urban areas."" Tenereillo expanded, saying, ""What's also great about Trapster is that it can work with handsets that have GPS, or, it can work with handsets that don't have GPS, because of the WiFi technology provided by Skyhook."" One would think that law enforcement would take a dim view of a company/service like Trapster -- since you could look at it as a service that is enabling speeders to escape detection. But both Tenereillo and Morgan point out that the opposite is true. ""We have a quote on our Web site from the National Association of Police Organizations that states a service like Trapster is actually a positive,"" says Tenereillo. ""Because, if one driver warns everyone else that there is a speed trap at a certain location, then everyone slows down -- which, after all, is the whole purpose of a speed trap, getting drivers to slow down.""","Trapster is a cell-phone social network that allows motorists to alert others .
Users send alerts via cell phone regarding locations of speed traps .

"(CNN) -- More than two weeks after a factory collapsed in Bangladesh, trapping workers in a mangled concrete heap, the death toll has surpassed 900. Authorities pulled more bodies from the rubble, bringing the number of people killed to 931, Bangladesh's national news agency BSS reported Thursday. The April 24 collapse occurred in Savar, a suburb of the capital, Dhaka. Rescue workers saved more than 2,400 people in the aftermath of the collapse, but have focused on using heavy machinery to uncover bodies buried beneath the ruins. The building, which housed five factories full of garment workers, caved in, burying hundreds of people in a heap of concrete. It is the South Asian nation's deadliest industrial disaster. The owners of the building and the factories are under investigation over accusations they ordered workers to enter the premises on the day of the collapse despite cracks in the structure the day before. Bangladesh's $20 billion garment industry accounts for 77% of the country's exports. Among those caught up in the finger-pointing after the building's collapse are Western retailers and clothing brands that Bangladeshi suppliers say put heavy pressure on prices, resulting in bad pay and conditions for workers.

"Xinxiang, China (CNN) -- Duan Keke greets visitors with a crisp salute and a few pieces of candy. The 80-year-old man stands at the gates of Henan Provincial Military Hospital in China where he has lived in retirement for years, dressed in an olive green army uniform and soldier's cap, carrying a long wooden stick that he taps against the pavement as he walks. ""Thank you,"" he cheerfully repeats to hospital guests -- in Korean. Duan is a Chinese veteran who fought and bled for North Korea in the Korean War. Sixty years ago, U.S. and Chinese-led armies battled each other to a bloody standstill in a conflict between North and South Korea that left millions dead. In 1953, both sides signed a truce that has left the Korean Peninsula dangerously divided to this day. Last March, during an orchestrated campaign of international saber-rattling, the communist regime in North Korea declared that armistice agreement invalid. More: Why the Korean War still matters . In 1951, Duan was only 18 years old when he volunteered to join the Chinese People's Liberation Army. That same year, Duan was deployed to help defend Korean communists from Western-backed troops on the Korean Peninsula, shortly after China emerged from its own deadly civil war. ""The people of Korea were suffering,"" Duan says. ""We were watching the Korean people and we had all gone through war. You look at China, the revolution, the struggle against the Japanese, many people had died,"" Duan continues, recalling preceding years of turmoil in China. ""Seeing the people of Korea farming the land and being killed by enemy planes ... what were they to do if they could not farm? The planes would just come and bomb them to death. We had to help protect the people of Korea."" Today, Duan leads visitors down a dark corridor, past framed black-and-white photos of Chinese army heroes, to a tidy room in the hospital he calls home. Aside from a nephew, Duan saiys he had no living relatives. His neighbors are also elderly veterans dressed in military fatigues. They chat outside the hospital ward, seated on park benches. The uniforms are a source of pride for the retired military residents, but also apparently a hospital safety measure in case one of them wanders too far outside the grounds and into the city. ""They're worried that the veterans that came from the countryside will get lost, so when they come here they make them wear uniforms to keep them safe,"" Duan says. Much of what Duan recalls from the Korean War years seems to revolve around digging trenches, which he says provided essential protection from American warplanes. ""Digging trenches is not easy ... It's not soil, it's rock,"" he says, adding that they used their bayonets to break up the rocks. Though Chinese military units were accompanied by Korean translators, Duan says Chinese and Koreans soldiers were not allowed to fraternize. However, another Chinese Korean War veteran says he did have face-to-face encounters with U.S. soldiers. Former infantry soldier You Jie Xiang says his mission was to guard American prisoners of war held far back from the front lines. ""Handling the captives was very dangerous,"" You says. ""They might kick you so I had to tell them to stay on their knees."" More: North Korea photos and maps . Duan says he remained in Korea until 1953, when he was severely wounded in battle. During his two year deployment, one of Duan's missions was to charge up a mountain carrying explosives towards well entrenched Western-backed troops. ""They're shooting guns at you,"" he says, holding his walking stick up to his shoulder like a rifle and making shooting noises. ""We had to bring up the explosives and bomb them, using explosives and flaming oil."" Duan was wounded at least twice. He rolls back a sleeve to show scars from severe burns resulting from what he said was an airstrike. And in the privacy of the medical ward, he insists on dropping his pants and lifting his shirt to show deep scars in his abdomen left by bullets that struck him during a battle on a mountain. Duan says he was shipped home after this injury, which left him maimed and unable to reproduce. The sight of the elderly war veterans in their baggy uniforms contrasts sharply with the vision of modern China that has grown up around them. The years of starvation and conflict seem like distant history, in a country that is now the world's second largest economy, as well as home to billionaires, gleaming sky-scrapers, luxury shopping malls and brand new airports. The veterans at the Henan Provincial Military Hospital say China's newest generation know little of the hardships they suffered in Korea. ""Young people? Of course they don't know,"" says You, the former infantry soldier who once escorted imprisoned American GIs. ""These wars took place decades ago. All the young people have no idea."" Asked whether Koreans understood the sacrifice Chinese troops had made, the veteran shakes his head ""no."" ""What do the Koreans know?"" You asks himself out loud. ""They know what the Korean (government) tells the Korean people."" This modern-day ambivalence towards North Korea is echoed by some Chinese intellectuals. Recently, Deng Yuwen openly challenged the Chinese government's alliance with North Korea in writing. Partly as a result, he lost his job as deputy editor of the Study Times, a journal published by the Communist Party. ""The current laissez-faire attitude the U.S. and China have towards North Korea is comparable to that of (former British Prime Minister Neville) Chamberlain towards Germany before World War II,"" Deng said, in a recent interview with CNN. If Pyongyang continues threatening its Asian neighbors, Deng argued, Beijing should take steps to reign in the regime, like freezing North Korean accounts in Chinese banks. ""The unpredictability of North Korea's policies prove its nature is dangerous,"" Deng said. Veterans who risked their lives for North Korea more than half a century ago have little to say about the current government in Pyongyang. But they do not seem to hold a grudge against their former American enemies. When asked by an American reporter whether he had any message for the U.S., Duan responds by saying, ""the Americans are peaceful people."" Next to him, several of his fellow veterans nod in agreement. ""I think the Americans did not want to go to war (in Korea). War is death."" Asked whether he feared war might once again break out on the Korean Peninsula, Duan expresses confidence that the Chinese government would prevent hostilities from erupting. ""The central government will handle it. It is guided by the ideas of Mao Zedong,"" he says, referring to the founder of Communist China. ""Big countries don't want war and we're against war and this is what we've been taught."" More: Will North Korea listen to China?

"(CNN) -- Occupy Wall Street called on the masses to skip work and school on May 1, and to close their wallets. All this was supposed to amount to a general strike, if not an American Spring. Some even talked about bringing down capitalism. But the small demonstrations in many American cities and in other cities across the world had little effect. Rush hour on the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, supposed to be a major center of protest, flowed. In Los Angeles, two blocks were closed by the authorities in anticipation of possible disruptions. Reports were that protesters in New York did not shut down traffic, as they planned to do. Some 2,000 demonstrated in Athens, and 7,000 next to a Greek factory, one of the most poorly attended demonstrations in the recent experience of this troubled land. Workers marched in several other cities across the world, as they do on every May 1. Historically, general strikes were considered a powerful tool, meant to demonstrate the power of the people (often organized labor), able at least to gum up the working of major segments of the economy. In France, general strikes were used to force the government to make significant concessions. For instance, the 2006 demonstrations over the controversial CPE (or contrat premiÃ¨re embauche, first employment contract, which would have made it easier for employers to fire young workers) lasted two months before President Jacques Chirac scrapped the legislation. In the United States, the last general strike took place in 1946. While some 100,000 workers from 142 unions participated, it did not lead to concessions by the powers that be, let alone bring down anything. This time? If the past is any predictor of the future, the deliberately nonhierarchical Occupy Wall Street movement, with its fuzzy messages and vague goals, is not going to leave a major mark. Occupy May Day ""fizzled?"" Not so fast, say iReporters . Some observers saw, at least initially, ""an irresistible symmetry"" between Occupy Wall Street and the tea party, despite some clear differences. An article in TIME described Occupy Wall Street as a ""new outpouring of protest ... driven by the same fuel that gave fire to the tea party."" In an October 2011 interview, President Obama said, ""I understand the frustrations being expressed in those protests. In some ways, they're not that different from some of the protests that we saw coming from the tea party."" The comparison is informative, but in a rather different way. It highlights how weak the left is and how strong the right is in American politics. The tea party has a sharply edged message and has used its considerable following to elect public officials, who in turn have affected public policy. For instance, they prevented the GOP leadership from compromising with Obama on raising taxes in exchange for cutting entitlements and government outlays. And the tea party put deficit reduction on the top of the political agenda. Speaking about the August 2011 deficit deal, Sen. John McCain said, ""I don't think without the tea party we would have had an agreement."" There is little in Occupy Wall Street's record that compares to these political victories. Defenders of Occupy Wall Street may well argue that it was never meant to be a political power, but rather a cultural force, more like the counterculture of the '60s than a new civil rights movement. Jonathan Schell argues that ""it was not a new set of policy ideas that was being born â€” the world was already overloaded with these, unacted upon â€” but a new spirit. ..."" But the cultural messages Occupy Wall Street carries, say, environmental responsibility or divorce from capitalism, are far from clear. And while the counterculture could thrive (briefly) in an age in which America was well-heeled, the message of opting out of the prevailing system does not seem to bring out the masses who seek employment, to avoid foreclosure, or simply to make ends meet. Arguably the greatest achievement attributed to Occupy Wall Street is that it put inequality on the agenda of American politics, with its most memorable slogan: ""We are the 99%."" Writing in The New York Times, Brian Stelter described this line as a new ""national shorthand"" for the vast economic disparities facing the United States, noting that ""whatever the long-term effects of the Occupy movement, protesters have succeeded in implanting 'We are the 99%'...into the cultural and political lexicon."" Even an article in the conservative Weekly Standard declared Occupy Wall Street has changed the public discourse, making inequality the topic of the day. There is no question that inequality has been rising in the United States and that it raises numerous issues concerning what is a fair distribution of income and wealth, what taxes we ought to raise, and how to prevent those who acquire great economic power from also gaining excessive political power (through campaign contributions). I share these social justice concerns. However, I cannot help but note that there is a world of difference between putting something on the front pages of the newspapers for a few weeks and achieving changes in laws and, above all, in the distribution of wealth. Given that Occupy Wall Street has not advocated any specific ways to reduce inequality and does not have the political organization to back up such an agenda, either others will have to find ways to curb inequality or we will see little progress on this front in the great budget battles to come shortly after the 2012 election. Most assuredly, a general strike that fizzles will not serve the cause of reducing inequality, or even help Occupy Wall Street find its sea legs. Occupy Wall Street will have more opportunities to show that it did not flame out; however, it had better come up with a more cogent strategy, or it will soon be one more wasted force, one more protest movement that vented feelings but engendered precious little real social change. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Amitai Etzioni.","Amitai Etzioni says Occupy Wall Street's May Day protests made little splash .
He says general strike sometimes effective in history. But Occupy's goals too vague .
He says it's no focused tea party, which has affected policy, helped elect officials .

"(CNN) -- A Navy SEAL killed in a parachute training accident this week in Arizona belonged to the same elite squad that includes those chosen to go after Osama bin Laden in Pakistan two years ago, a source familiar with the matter said. It was the second deadly military training accident in as many weeks and the third notable one in the United States since February. The other two killed 14 Marines combined in a mortar explosion and a helicopter collision. The latest incident occurred around 12:30 p.m. local time on Thursday in a rugged part of the U.S. Special Operations Command facility at Pinal Airpark, military officials said on Friday. Two sailors were undergoing a free-fall routine before opening their parachutes, a Navy official said in a statement, which added it was a normal exercise to maintain readiness. One died from his injuries and another remained in stable condition on Friday at the University of Arizona Medical Center in Tucson, the Navy said. It did not identify either and the accident is under investigation. Lt. Cmdr. David McKinney, a spokesman for the Naval Special Warfare Command, did not reveal specifics but said the sailor who died ""was assigned to an East Coast-based Naval Special Warfare unit."" A source with knowledge of matter said he was part of SEAL Team Six, members of which mounted the May 2011 operation that killed the al Qaeda leader in a third-floor bedroom of his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. It was not clear whether or not he took part in the bin Laden mission. The sailor who was injured was also a SEAL, the source said. But it was not clear whether he was part of the same East Coast group. The incident followed another on March 18 in which seven Marines were killed when a round detonated inside a motar tube during a training exercise at Hawthorne Army Depot in western Nevada, a military commander said at the time. On February 22, another seven Marines were killed in a midair collision of two military helicopters along the Arizona-California border, officials said. The crash occurred during routine training operations. Authorities launched an investigation. CNN's Chris Lawrence and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","NEW: The incident occurred during a ""normal"" parachute exercise, the Navy said .

The six family members don't even have frostbite, said Dr. Doug Vacek, declaring their condition ""absolutely amazing."" Christina McIntee, 25, and the youngest child Chloe, 3, were released from a hospital Wednesday. Their health is ""perfect,"" Vacek said. James Glanton, 34, and the other three children remain hospitalized so they can receive more IV hydration. But they're ""doing really well,"" Vacek said. It's unclear how soon they may go home. Lab test results will help make the decision, Vacek said. The family -- Glanton, McIntee, the two children they share and McIntee's niece and nephew -- went out Sunday together for a playful outing in the snow. The adventure dissolved into a fight for survival after their Jeep Wrangler turned over and slid down an embankment on its top, ending up in a crevice 15 miles from Lovelock. They were found nearly 48 hours later, at midday Tuesday. In a statement, the family thanked numerous agencies for ""the valiant search and rescue efforts"" and requested privacy as it heals and recovers from the ordeal. The family is ""very truly appreciative of the care and love"" from the community and the entire country, the statement said. Patricia Bianchi, CEO of Pershing General Hospital, read the statement to reporters. The family had taken critical steps to prepare for the trip, including bringing along blankets and food.

"(CNN) -- Wayman Tisdale, who became a successful jazz musician after retiring from pro basketball, died Friday morning after a two-year battle with cancer, his agent said. Wayman Tisdale greets Shaquille O'Neal during a game November 1, 1996. Tisdale, 44, died in a Tulsa, Oklahoma, hospital, where his wife took him when he had trouble breathing early Friday, agent Scott Pang said. Tisdale's death was ""a complete shock"" and came as he prepared to return to the recording studio next week to work on a project with jazz guitarist Norman Brown, Pang said. ""He was a real testament to the power of positive thinking,"" Pang said. ""Even after the cancer and amputating his leg above his knee, he never lost that smile on his face."" Doctors discovered Tisdale's bone cancer after he broke his leg in a fall down a flight of stairs, according to the official biography on his Web site. ""It really showed me what's important in life, man,"" he said in his bio. ""It's not getting as many houses as I can, not driving the biggest cars. What's important is family and being healthy."" Tisdale averaged 15 points and six rebounds a game over a 12-year NBA career, during which he played with the Indiana Pacers, Sacramento Kings and Phoenix Suns, according to the NBA Web site. ""He was the nicest man in the world with the biggest heart and an even bigger smile,"" Reggie Miller, Tisdale's teammate with the Pacers in the late 1980s, said in a statement to the Indianapolis Star. ""I thank him for befriending me and showing me there is more to life than just basketball."" Sam Perkins, also a former Indiana Pacer and best man at Tisdale's wedding, told the Indianapolis Star that Tisdale's enthusiasm went beyond the court. ""That's a real friend who's got your back and would do just about anything for you,"" Perkins said. ""That smile just gets you. He was upbeat all the time."" Former NBA player and coach Avery Johnson told the Indianapolis Star Tisdale was always smiling and had an unbelievably upbeat attitude. ""Every time he came in a room or before a game, he always had that smile,"" Johnson said. ""Now, he would elbow you afterward, but he always had that smile."" Tisdale was also considered a Sooner superstar during his stint at Oklahoma University. ""Wayman's one of the biggest reasons why I chose Oklahoma,"" said Stacey King, Tisdale's Oklahoma teammate and a former Chicago Bulls player. ""I wanted to be part of something special, and it made logical sense to go to OU, because I wanted to pattern my game after him. I wanted to be like him. People used to talk about 'Be like Mike [Jordan],' but I wanted to be like Wayman. We've lost a special person. I don't think there will ever be another Wayman Tisdale."" His jazz recording career began in 1995, two years before his 1997 NBA retirement, with a debut CD that rose to No. 4 on Billboard's Contemporary Jazz chart and crossed over onto the R&B charts, the bio said. Subsequent songs -- including ""Ain't No Stopping Us Now,"" ""Can't Hide Love"" and ""Don't Take Your Love Away"" -- were top radio hits. Singer and actor Jamie Foxx praised the basketball star's music career, telling Rolling Stone magazine in 2005 that his all-time backup band would be ""Sheila E on the drums; Herbie Hancock on the keys; Earth, Wind and Fire singing backup vocals; Prince and Slash on guitar; Randy Jackson on percussion; Wayman Tisdale on bass; Kenny G on the sax with Branford Marsalis; and Wynton Marsalis on trumpet.""

"(CNN) -- In six hours, a person might walk 18 or so miles. By car, it could be 350-plus miles. A commercial airplane might get as far as 3,400 miles. A spaceship? In that much time, you could get from Earth to the International Space Station. That's what happened with a Soyuz TMA-08M spacecraft, which launched from Kazakhstan at 4:43 p.m. ET Thursday, or 2:43 a.m. Friday local time, with three soon-to-be space station crew members on board. NASA mission control declared ""contact and capture confirmed"" at 10:28 p.m. ET -- four minutes earlier than planned -- indicating the spacecraft had successfully docked. This six-hour jaunt was exponentially faster than the normal two-day adventure that astronauts and cosmonauts typically take to get to the ISS. That's because, while the live-in orbiter is a mere 250 miles from Earth, it's always moving -- so it's not a simple matter of going from Point A to Point B. That's why it has traditionally taken so long to get there, with the spacecraft going round the Earth every 90 or so minutes, which works out to about 16 total before docking. More space news on CNN Light Years . But this go around, the Soyuz only orbited four times before hooking up with the space station. ""We're trying to cut that amount of time that they had to be in those close quarters,"" NASA spokesman Kelly Humphries said, noting the spacecraft has a basic bathroom but little living space. ""... They may be sharper now, if they'd have to take over the docking."" SpaceX 'Dragon' capsule returns from ISS trip . The NASA spokesman explained that equipment and computer software upgrades, among other factors, helped to make Thursday's historically fast flight possible. And it's possible space officials might decide that the longer, old-fashioned way -- allowing the crew to get its space legs over two days, however cramped they might be -- is preferable, depending on how this mission goes, Humphries said. This pioneering, fast-track crew was made up Pavel Vinogradov and Aleksandr Misurkin from Russia's space agency, as well as NASA astronaut Chris Cassidy. With their voyage complete -- and once the space station's hatches open for them, scheduled for soon after midnight -- they'll have plenty of time to get comfy: They are scheduled to remain on the orbiter for about six months before heading home.

"(CNN) -- A bond hearing is scheduled for Friday in the case of George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer who fatally shot 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Florida, the court said Wednesday. The new judge in the case, Kenneth Lester Jr., will preside, according to the Eighteenth Judicial Circuit. The previous judge in the case approved a motion Wednesday to disqualify her after it was revealed that her husband works with a CNN legal analyst who has commented on the case. Seminole Circuit Judge Jessica Recksiedler said in her decision that while the findings on each basis were ""legally insufficient"" for disqualification, ""the cumulative effect of the events and the totality of the circumstances provides a legally sufficient basis for this court to grant the motion to disqualify,"" a statement from the court said. New judge 'no soft touch' This week, Recksiedler is on temporary assignment from the Florida Supreme Court and is hearing oral arguments at the Fifth District Court of Appeal in Daytona Beach, court spokeswoman Michelle Kennedy said in a statement Tuesday. Wednesday's order directed the case to be returned to the chief judge for reassignment, who in turn ordered that Lester be appointed to preside over the Zimmerman case. Zimmerman, 28, fatally shot Martin in Sanford, Florida, on February 26, a killing he has said was in self-defense. The case has stirred civil rights activists nationwide and drawn intense publicity. The city of Sanford has scheduled a community meeting at 6:30 p.m. Thursday at a church to provide members of the public an opportunity to discuss the incident, according to the Sanford mayor's office. Mayor Jeff Triplett will be among officials attending, the office said. Case divides Sanford . Recksiedler said last week that she would entertain motions to disqualify her from the trial because her husband is a law partner of Mark NeJame's. Zimmerman approached NeJame about representing him. NeJame is now a CNN contributor, providing analysis on this case. NeJame said Zimmerman ""contacted my office, attempting to reach me, and wanted to hire me to represent him"" on March 13. One of his law partners relayed that request to NeJame, who declined. He explained later that he knew how taking on ""big national cases (can) take a lot out of you"" and wanted to have more time to spend with his children. ""I decided simply not to,"" the Orlando lawyer said. NeJame acknowledged Tuesday, ""it's an appearance of a conflict, an appearance of an impropriety"" for Recksiedler to preside over the case. But he said he thought she did nothing improper by waiting for a request from attorneys instead of offering to recuse herself first. ""I don't think she did anything out of the ordinary for this extraordinary situation,"" he said. Meanwhile, media organizations, including CNN, petitioned Recksiedler Monday to reverse an order sealing court records in Zimmerman's prosecution. Prosecutors did not object when Zimmerman's attorneys asked Recksiedler to seal records last week. The judge ordered the court filings and other records sealed ""without giving the public and press an opportunity to oppose closure,"" the media said in its motion. Florida law requires a judge to consider whether the records closure is needed to ""prevent a serious and imminent threat"" to justice, the media members argued. The court must also find that there is no alternative to sealing the records that would provide a fair trial and that the action would not be ""broader than necessary to accomplish this purpose,"" they said. In addition to CNN, several broadcasting and newspaper companies -- including the publishers of USA Today, the Miami Herald and The New York Times -- are part of the effort to unseal the documents. Zimmerman defense attorney Mark O'Mara said Monday that he favors keeping documents sealed in this case in large part because of concerns that witnesses might be contacted and in danger if certain information is released. ""(Our) overall philosophy (is) to keep the information flow concentrated within the court system,"" he said. ""It's much better handled there."" As to his client, O'Mara said he speaks ""at least a couple times a day"" with Zimmerman, whom he described as doing well physically but ""frightened."" Zimmerman is scheduled to return to court Friday for a bail hearing. O'Mara says he hopes his client will be eligible for bail after that hearing and eventually be allowed to go free until the trial. If he does get out, though, the lawyer said, there are legitimate fears about Zimmerman's safety. ""There have been a lot of emotions that have come forward in this case, and some of those emotions have shown themselves in bad ways,"" O'Mara said. Lester has served on the circuit court since 1996. He is currently assigned to the Criminal Division but has previously served in the Juvenile, Delinquency, Dependency, Probate, Guardianship, and Mental Health divisions of the circuit court. A 2011 poll by the Central Florida Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers rated Lester the top judge in the county in terms of legal knowledge and diligence. He had the second-highest overall score among Seminole County circuit judges in that survey, which also ranked the jurists for impartiality, freedom from bias and demeanor.

"(CNN) -- City commissioners in Sanford, Florida, voted Monday to reject the proposed resignation of their embattled police chief, who has been under fire for the handling of the probe into Trayvon Martin's death in February. Chief Bill Lee has been on paid leave since March 22, a day after the commission expressed a lack of confidence in him because of the case. He remains so after the commission's decision, with Capt. Darren Scott continuing to serve as acting chief. George Zimmerman, who has said he killed the 17-year-old Martin in self-defense, was not arrested after being questioned by police the night of the shooting. Arrested weeks later after a special prosecutor was assigned to the case, he was released from jail early Monday and hours later entered a not guilty plea. Earlier Monday, the city announced in a statement that a separation agreement had been reached with Lee to resign. If it was approved by the City Commission, it would have taken effect at midnight. But by a 3-2 vote, the commission opted not to accept the proposed deal, which would have permanently dismissed Lee from the job and given him a severance package. Two commissioners had questioned the fairness of Lee losing his job, while Mayor Jeff Triplett said he preferred to wait possibly several months for the results of an investigation into Lee and his department. ""I'm not ready to have him come back and run the Police Department, but I don't know if I'm ready for this either,"" Triplett said, who sided with the majority to reject the resignation. Benjamin Crump, a lawyer for Martin's family, criticized the commission for not letting Lee step down. ""Sanford residents deserve quality leadership in law enforcement who will handle investigations fairly for all people,"" he said. ""If Chief Bill Lee recognized that his resignation would help start the healing process in Sanford, city leadership should have accepted it in an effort to move the city forward."" City Manager Norton N. Bonaparte told CNN that ""moving the city forward"" is a priority, and something that he hoped might have been expedited by making Lee's departure final. During Monday's meeting, Bonaparte explained that he and Lee had ""agreed to"" the resignation, after Lee ""decided that he can no longer serve as police chief."" But Randy Jones, a commissioner, pointed to other parts of the agreement stating Lee was ""willing, ready and able"" to remain on as chief, hadn't been found to have done anything wrong and was resigning on Bonaparte's ""recommendation."" Added Patty Mahany, another commissioner supportive of Lee, ""What did the chief do wrong? I mean, tell us."" Bonaparte said an interim chief -- in place of Scott, the current acting chief -- could be in place early next week. The case has drawn intense media attention, with Sanford residents and many civil rights leaders from outside central Florida criticizing the Police Department for not immediately arresting Zimmerman, 28, after he shot the unarmed teenager. HLN: Zimmerman wife talks publicly for the first time . Zimmerman is now free and awaiting trial, after making bail and leaving the John E. Polk Correctional Facility in Sanford at 12:05 a.m. Monday. ""He's doing well. He's very glad to be out, trying to get settled in, still worried about his safety ... talking to his family and feeling much better than being in (jail),"" his lawyer Mark O'Mara told CNN later Monday. Also Monday, O'Mara filed documents in court in which Zimmerman entered a written not guilty plea and waived the right to appear at a formal arraignment. Zimmerman is now ""on his own"" with no police protection or security detail, O'Mara said, shuttling to and from several secret locations in light of threats against him and his family. He wore a bulletproof vest while leaving the jail accompanied by Michael Smith, the owner of Magic Bail Bonds. ""There's been a lot of chatter lately about his release, and that's concerning to him and us,"" said O'Mara. Follow the timeline of case . The Seminole County Sheriff's Office said that Zimmerman had been fitted with a GPS monitoring device, allowing authorities to track his location. Zimmerman's release came as something of a surprise. Over the weekend, his lawyer had said Zimmerman might remain behind bars until the middle of this week as his team worked to secure funds to meet the $150,000 bail set last Friday. With the 10% cash payment customarily made to secure bond, Zimmerman's family needed $15,000 for him to make bail. Martin's family wasn't pleased by news of Zimmerman's release, said one of their attorneys, Daryl Parks. ""It's tough for them to see their son's killer walk free again,"" he said. The case has riveted the nation and sparked intense discussions about race, gun control and ""stand your ground"" laws, which make it legal for people to use deadly force when they feel a reasonable threat of death or serious injury. Florida to review 'stand your ground' law . Although details of the shooting remain murky, what is known is that Martin ventured out on February 26 from the home of his father's fiancee in Sanford and went to a nearby convenience store, where he bought a bag of Skittles and an Arizona Iced Tea. After spotting him, ZImmerman called 911 to complain about a ""suspicious"" person in the neighborhood. In the call, the neighborhood watch volunteer said he followed Martin after the teen started to run, prompting the dispatcher to tell him, ""We don't need you to do that."" Zimmerman claims the unarmed teen attacked him, before he fired his gun. Martin's supporters say Zimmerman targeted Martin because he was black. On Friday, Zimmerman's father testified that when he saw his son the day after the shooting, he was wearing a protective cover over his nose, his face was swollen, and he had two vertical gashes on his head. Martin's family and the special prosecutor appointed to investigate the case have rejected Zimmerman's self-defense claim, saying they believe Zimmerman disobeyed the police dispatcher who advised him to stop following Martin, racially profiled him and unjustly killed him. The case has also shined a hot spotlight on the city of Sanford, and particularly interracial relations in the community. Mahany, for one, said Monday that reports of gaping rifts in Sanford along racial lines have been vastly overstated, adding, ""I don't think Sanford needs healing."" And Jones, the other dissenting commissioner, blamed outsiders for fanning the flames. ""It is not Sanford residents who created this firestorm,"" he said. ""It was brought in from the outside. We all know it."" CNN's Vivian Kuo, David Mattingly, Leslie Tripp Holland, Martin Savidge and Holly Yan contributed to this report.","NEW: Zimmerman is ""doing well,"" ""feeling much better than being in"" jail, his lawyer says .

"(CNN) -- Rush joined the likes of Aerosmith, The Doors and James Taylor on Thursday when the trio was -- finally -- inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Having been eligible for a nomination since 1998, the honor was a long time coming for Rush and loyal fans of the Canadian band. ""This is a little overwhelming for a nice Jewish boy from Toronto,"" lead vocalist Geddy Lee said before thanking ""the most passionate, most dedicated, incredible fan base around the globe."" Guitarist Alex Lifeson delivered an acceptance speech consisting entirely of different speeds and intonations of the words ""blah blah blah,"" which still somehow managed to convey the story of being surprised that the band was finally being inducted and thanking the fans for all of their support. Even backstage Lifeson didn't speak another word. ""Believe me, that's a blessing,"" Lee said. Randy Newman, Heart, Albert King, Donna Summer and Public Enemy also joined the exclusive club on Thursday. ""Once again, thank you guys for inducting Public Enemy into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,"" said Hank Shocklee, a member of the group's production team, the Bomb Squad who along with group frontman rapper Chuck D. helped create the Public Enemy sound. ""Our mission was basically to inspire, to teach, to do something that we haven't done in music, or even in the rap game, was to bring about a unity, a collective effort, so that we can fight the power."" Singer Harry Belafonte Jr., praised Public Enemy for changing ""everything about the emerging urban musical force called rap."" He applauded group members Chuck D, Flavor Flav, Terminator X, Professor Griff and DJ Lord for using the medium at their disposal to speak the truth and ""inspire others to take on the forces of oppression that separate us and try to suffocate progressive and radical thought."" Flavor Flav, who wore a white tuxedo identical to his son's, acknowledged his trademark accessory during his lengthy acceptance speech. This is the ""last night that you see me wearing this particular clock, yes, because ... this is going into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,"" he said pointing to the clock, with a white bezel and black face, that was hanging around his neck. He quickly added: ""Yes, I will put another clock on, y'all know that."" There were performances by the inductees and musical tributes like the Foo Fighters performing in full Rush regalia of white satin and wigs, Usher singing Michael Jackson's ""Rock With You"" and Jennifer Hudson performing some of Donna Summer's biggest hits including ""Bad Girls."" The show ended with all the inductees together onstage for a super-jam finale. Though the ceremony took place in Los Angeles, Boston was on everyone's mind, including Neil Diamond's, in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombing. ""For some strange reason, Sweet Caroline has become an anthem in Boston, and I give them the song with my heart, and I hope it offers some comfort to them right now,"" Diamond told CNN. Soundgarden's Chris Cornell told CNN that the tragedy in Boston scares him as a father. ""It could happen on my block,"" he said. ""Sometimes I'm not home, sometimes I'm touring. ... To me, it's maddening. I want to get angry about it, but that's the whole point. They want people to get angry about it and to get violent and become like them, and we can't do that.""

"Atlanta (CNN) -- On Monday, I signed an online petition standing with President Obama, Warren Buffett and others to urge Congress to pass the Buffett Rule. It was a small gesture to stand for what is fair. The Buffett Rule, simply stated, requires the wealthiest Americans to pay taxes at rates not less than rates paid by middle-income Americans. Current loopholes that allow millionaires and billionaires to have unfairly low tax rates would be closed. It's only fair. So much has happened this year to focus our attention on what is fair: Obama's State of the Union address, the Trayvon Martin case, the rhetoric around the Supreme Court's review of the Affordable Care Act and Paul Ryan's proposed budget, with its cuts to services to middle- and low-income Americans. What has happened to the concept of fairness? I'll tell you: It's been retooled. No longer is it defined as my parents taught me. I hear their voices saying, ""Play fair,"" ""Share (my toys) and play fair,"" ""Don't cheat. Play fair."" ""You'll have your turn at bat, play fair."" ""Don't fight, play fair."" ""Win fair."" Even in the midst of segregation, with its pervasive lack of fairness on every front, they never wavered in their lessons about fairness. More important, there was clarity of meaning. Fairness was at the heart of being a good person. Fairness was about how I related to others, combined with how others related to me. Fairness was not one-sided. In my early 30s, I worked for someone who said, ""Fair is when I win."" It was his attempt to clarify inherent complexities in the term ""fair."" It was then I awakened to a definition of ""fair"" I had not known, definition in which the individual determined fairness by how the situation affected him and him alone. Fair had been retooled. Its meaning had shifted. In this year's State of the Union message, Obama said, ""We can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot and everyone does their fair share and everyone plays by the same set of rules."" I know what those words mean to me. I now know they may mean something very different to others. Some heard the same words and thought, ""Fair is when I win."" How else can we explain the person who got his job because of personal or family connections, now protesting another person getting a job because of government or corporate initiatives? How else can we explain cuts or freezes in salaries for workers and huge pay raises and bonuses for top executives? How else can we explain board members approving such bonuses, saying ""it's only fair""? How else can we explain how those with the most financial resources pay the lowest tax rates? Fair? Over my 60-plus years of living, I have been close to people of varied socioeconomic levels and life experiences. The differences are often striking. Take health care. I was working as a corporate executive during the developmental stages of H.R. 3962, the Affordable Care Act, currently under review by the Supreme Court. There, I was with my peers in our good jobs with comprehensive health insurance. Some were indifferent to health care reform, while others were vehemently against it. For me, it was personal. Affordable, accessible, quality health care for every person was only fair. Was it ""only fair"" because I had more personal contact with poor people or sick people or people without health insurance? Was it ""only fair"" because I knew the challenges and outrageous costs faced by my mother, who struggled with multiple sclerosis, or my sister, who has sarcoidosis? Perhaps. But still today, as a retiree, I think it only fair. My peers, for the most part, were good people. Yet there were times I thought their attitudes and actions most unfair. It really scares me that ""fair,"" as I know it, may have gone for good. The bright flames of innovation, hard work, and individual and collective achievement are snuffed out when people feel that they do not have a fair shot. Snuffed out when rules change to fit the whims of those in power. Snuffed out because people stop trying and give up on their dreams. As a teenager, I fell in love with the writings of the brilliant poet Langston Hughes (1902-67). In his ""Dream Deferred,"" he asked: . ""What happens to a dream deferred? Does it dry up like a raisin in the sun? Or fester like a sore -- And then run? Does it stink like rotten meat? Or crust and sugar over -- like a syrupy sweet? Maybe it just sags like a heavy load. Or does it explode?"" God grant me strength to fight for what is fair. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Marsha Johnson.","Marsha Sampson Johnson: It's only fair that the wealthiest pay higher tax rates .
She says some have redefined ""fairness"" as ""when I win""
Johnson: We have been taught that fairness is not one-sided; it's about others, as well .
She says the spirit of innovation and achievement is snuffed out when things are not fair ."
"(CNN) -- U.S. ski star Mikaela Shiffrin underlined her status as the best slalom racer on the World Cup circuit in Finland Saturday then landed the prize of her childhood dreams -- a reindeer! Teenager Shiffrin was excited to relegate Maria Hoefl-Riesch and Tina Maze into the minor places, but absolutely thrilled to get an early Christmas present, whom she quickly named Rudolph. ""Who wouldn't want to get a reindeer? I remember being five years old and Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer was my favorite song,"" she told the official World Cup skiing website. ""I think we will be getting along. I hope that when he get's older and trained I can go for a ride on a sledge with him,"" added Shiffrin. She won't be taking the reindeer with her on her travels, but will meet Rudolph again when she returns to the Finnish ski resort of Levi for further races. With Sochi 2014 looming, Shiffrin's performance laid down an early marker and reigning Olympic champion Hoefl-Riesch from Germany was 1.06 seconds behind after two runs, with Slovenia's Maze 1.61 seconds slower. Maze was disappointed to be so far back and to miss out on a prize she also coveted. ""I already was making room for a reindeer back home, but unfortunately it was not my turn to win it,"" she said with a smile. Fellow skiing superstar Lindsey Vonn of the United States also claimed a four-legged prize after winning a race in Val d'Isere in France, opting for a cow rather than the prize money. A cow was also presented to Roger Federer by grateful organizers when he returned to play the Swiss Open in Gstaad this year. When he took part in the same event in 2003 after taking his first Wimbledon title he was also given a cow. For Shiffrin, the reindeer was the icing on the cake after a superb performance, keeping the red World Cup leaders' bib she earned last season. ""There's definitely some relief there...one of my goals is to keep my slalom standings, and it's nice to know I'm not that far off,"" she said before going off to place a picture of herself with the reindeer on her Facebook page.","Mikaela Shiffrin wins season opening slalom in World Cup .

"Denver (CNN) -- A year ago, 42-year-old runner Victor Carlos never thought he'd be excited just to see the starting line. But that was before he almost died. In fact, the father of two girls didn't breathe for a month; a machine pushed oxygen through his body. Now he's training for another marathon. It all began in December with a bad bout of the flu that led to an acute bacterial infection. By the time he checked into the hospital, Carlos was barely hanging on. ""We walked into the triage, and his oxygen level was only 57%, and everybody turned a corner,"" Carlos' wife, Brenda Voglewede, told CNN. Healthy blood oxygen levels are higher than 95%. Carlos was in deep trouble. He had developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, also known as ARDS. It was slowly killing Carlos by attacking his lungs. ""Not only that, but he had multiple organ failure related to the infection. So his kidneys were not working. His liver was not working. And his bone marrow was failing as well,"" said Dr. Ashok Babu, a cardiothoracic surgeon at the University of Colorado Hospital. Babu had no time to spare. He knew trying to force air into Carlos' lungs would do more harm than good. But without oxygen, Carlos' organs would soon shut down. Babu had one shot: a procedure called extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or ECMO. With this treatment, doctors turn down the patient's respirator, then insert a special tube through the heart. A pump draws blood from the body, flushes it through an oxygenation machine that removes the carbon dioxide and delivers oxygen back to the heart. It functions as an external lung, without the patient taking a single breath. ""So (oxygenated blood) could pass through the lungs, and the lungs didn't have to do anything to it because it was already processed,"" Babu said. ""And what we see on the X-ray is the lungs basically collapse down to nothing. ... They are just resting. We support the patient until the lungs can heal on their own."" Carlos' family was told he had a 40% to 50% chance of survival. ""Dr. Babu initially said he thought he'd be on ECMO for a week,"" Voglewede recalled. ""Then the week turned into two weeks. And then he's just like, 'Well, sometimes you just have to wait these things out.' "" Babu said, ""Two weeks into it we were all pretty worried that we had this young guy whose lungs just didn't seem to be coming back. At the time, he was the patient we had had on ECMO the longest in the history of our program."" Two weeks became four. Carlos didn't take a single breath for a month. Then a breakthrough came. ""Somewhat miraculously, his lungs just started to open up on their own,"" Babu said. By that time, Carlos was a shadow of his former self. He had lost more than 30 pounds. ""You can imagine, before going into the hospital you are this active person. Then you go in, they put you under, and when you wake ... you can't sit up, you can't move your arms up and you look at your legs, and they're just not there anymore,"" Carlos said. ""Then you realize it's far worse than you ever expected it to be."" Still, he was determined to make a full recovery. Seven weeks after entering the hospital, Carlos got to go home. ""I started out just walking a block and then pushing that out the following day to a block and a half, or two. Then it was like walking to school with the girls,"" he said. Remarkably, just six months later, Carlos is running. ""My goal at the time was to be able to jog nonstop for three miles. And I didn't think that was going to happen until November. That happened in May,"" he said. Once he was able to cover three miles, the distance he usually started out at to train for a marathon, ""that's when I knew it was just a matter of time."" Carlos has set his sights on completing the Denver Rock 'N Roll Marathon on October 20. He's already covered the 26.2 miles in a training run. Carlos isn't running for time. He's running just because he can. ""Every long run gets a little emotional for me this time around. I think of all the people who were there when I couldn't do it for myself. I think of the nurses, people at work, my boss who sent cards ... neighbors, friends, family, all praying for me,"" he said. Watch Erin Burnett weekdays 7pm ET.

"(CNN) -- Greeted by streets packed with well-wishers, Barack Obama arrived in Myanmar on Monday for a historic visit that hopes to encourage the once repressive regime to continue with its ""remarkable journey."" The first sitting U.S. president to visit the country, Obama will urge its leaders, which have embarked on a series of far-reaching political and economic reforms since 2011, not to extinguish the ""flickers of progress that we have seen."" ""This remarkable journey has just begun, and has much further to go,"" Obama will say, according to excerpts of his speech released before his arrival. ""Reforms launched from the top of society must meet the aspirations of citizens who form its foundation."" During his six-hour visit, Obama will meet with Myanmar's President Thein Sein, whose reform drive has seen the release of hundreds of political prisoners and steps to open up the country's economy. The country, which is also known as Burma, was ruled by military leaders until early 2011 and for decades was politically and economically cut off from the rest of the world. He'll also meet fellow Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi at the lakeside villa where the pro-democracy icon spent years under house arrest. He said Suu Kyi, now a member of parliament, encouraged the visit during a recent trip to the White House. ""Obama fever"" has gripped Yangon, with the street from the airport lined with crowds waving the stars and stripes, taking pictures and craning for a glimpse of the president. Obama's image also featured on T-shirts, mugs and walls for sale in city stores. Myanmar faces unfolding crisis . On the eve of his Myanmar trip, Obama insisted that the visit was ""not an endorsement of the Burmese government."" ""This is an acknowledgment that there is a process under way inside that country that even a year and a half, two years ago, nobody foresaw,"" Obama told reporters in Thailand on Sunday, the first stop on his Asia trip. He added that the country was moving ""in a better direction."" As well as meeting Thein Sein and Suu Kyi, Obama will deliver a speech at the University of Yangon before departing for Cambodia on Monday afternoon, where he will attend the East Asia Summit. Western governments have responded to Myanmar's progressive efforts by easing sanctions that targeted the military regime. On Friday, the U.S. eased restrictions on imports of most goods from Burma. But the country has also witnessed bouts of turmoil in recent months. Violence between Rohingya Muslims and local Buddhists broke out in the western state of Rakhine. During the latest eruption of tensions, the United Nations said at least 89 people were killed in two weeks, and 110,000 were displaced. What's behind sectarian violence in Myanmar? Obama will urge Myanmar to use its ""diversity as a strength, not a weakness."" ""I believe deeply that this country can transcend its differences, and that every human being within these borders is a part of your nation's story."" He is expected to meet briefly with representatives of civil society organizations, including an advocate for Burma's Rohingya population. However, some aid organizations are questioning whether now is the right time for Obama to add legitimacy to Thein Sein's government. Burmese exile leaders and human rights advocates have expressed concerns that the visit is too soon, and may not yield the additional reforms that a presidential visit can deliver if it happens at the right time. Speaking Sunday alongside Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, Obama emphasized that the United States is ""a Pacific nation,"" and that events in the Pacific ""will shape so much of our security and prosperity"" in the future. He said ""restoring American engagement"" in the region is one of his priorities. Asia's vast economy accounts for roughly a quarter of the global gross domestic product. Challenges facing the U.S. economy seeped in Sunday. Obama, accompanied by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, joked with a monk in Thailand. ""We're working on this budget,"" he said. ""We're going to need a lot of prayer for that.""

"(CNN) -- Trayvon Martin's girlfriend, talking to him on the telephone, heard the teenager saying ""get off, get off,"" in the moments before his cell phone cut off and he was shot dead, according to a recording released Friday of the girl's interview with a prosecutor. Another witness, however, seems to put Martin on top of George Zimmerman for at least part of the struggle, according to another recording. ""When I first walked out there, the black guy was on top, and the only reason I can tell that was because the guy that was on the ground under him at that point wrestling was definitely a lighter color,"" the man, whose name has not been made public, said in the interview. Martin was African-American. Zimmerman is Hispanic. When first interviewed, the witness said the individual on the bottom was calling for help. But a few weeks later, in another interview, he said he wasn't sure. ""At first I thought it was the person on the ground, because me thinking rationally, if someone was on top, the person on the bottom would be yelling,"" the witness aid. ""I truly can't tell who, after thinking about it, was yelling for help just because it is so dark on that sidewalk. You can't see a mouth."" In his second interview, the witness said when he returned to the window while calling 911, he saw the person who had been on top sprawled in the grass, not moving. Another person with his hands in the air said, ""The gun's on the ground. I shot this guy in self-defense,"" according to the witness. Another witness said the heavier of the two individuals appeared to be on top. ""I know after seeing the TV of what's happening, comparing their pictures, I think Zimmerman was definitely on top because of his size,"" the witness said. The recordings provide the most detailed look yet into previously reported witness statements detailing the last moments of Martin's life. Martin, 17, was shot to death February 26 while walking in the Sanford, Florida, neighborhood where he was staying during a visit with his father. The girlfriend, whose name has not been made public, told Assistant State Attorney Bernie de la Rionda that Martin got away from the man, who turned out to be Zimmerman, but only temporarily. He was out of breath from running away and scared, she said, and decided not to keep running because he was close to the house where he was staying. And as Zimmerman drew closer, the girl said, Martin called out, ""Why you following me for?"" according to the recording. ""I hear this man, like this old man, say, 'What are you doing around here?' "" the girl said. The girl said she called out to Martin, asking what was happening, but he didn't answer. The next thing she heard was a bumping sound, followed by what might have been a scuffle. ""I could hear it a little bit, 'Get off, get off,' then the phone just hung up,"" the girl said. Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, is charged with second-degree murder in the death, which sparked nationwide protests and inflamed public passions over race relations and gun control. Another witness interviewed by police said Zimmerman ""looked like he had just gotten his butt whupped,"" according to a recording released by authorities. The witness also said Zimmerman seemed nonchalant about the shooting, ""like it was nothing."" Zimmerman told the witness to call his wife and ""just tell her I shot somebody."" A woman told Sanford officers she did not hear the sounds of fighting outside her residence. ""I heard nothing but a little kid scared to death, like crying."" Zimmerman has claimed self-defense in the shooting, saying Martin charged him after the two exchanged words, knocking him to the ground and hitting his head repeatedly against a concrete sidewalk. Prosecutors say Zimmerman profiled Martin as a criminal and killed him, even though he was doing nothing wrong. Zimmerman has pleaded not guilty. The recordings and other documents released as part of the court case also touch on the racial component of the case. In one recording, a former co-worker of Zimmerman's says Zimmerman made him the butt of a long-running office joke, ridiculing his Middle Eastern accent and bullying him in what the witness described as a juvenile but infuriating effort to fit in with other workers. In another, an anonymous caller tells a Sanford police officer that Zimmerman and his family are racists. ""I don't know what happened. I don't know at all, who this kid was or anything else,"" the woman said. ""But I know George. And I know he does not like black people. He would start something. He's a very confrontational person."" Some people have also attributed a racial epithet to Zimmerman during his call with an emergency dispatcher. But an FBI analysis, released Thursday, determined that the word could not be definitively identified ""due to weak signal level and poor recording quality."" Zimmerman's former attorneys and an audio expert said in April that they believed Zimmerman used the word ""punks,"" not a slur. The recordings released Friday are the latest in a series of revelations from the official investigation into the shooting. Authorities are making details of the case publicly available as attorneys prepare for Zimmerman's trial. Among the documents released was one filed with prosecutors by Sanford police two weeks after the shooting, urging Zimmerman's arrest. New documents shed light on Trayvon Martin killing . ""The encounter between George Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin was ultimately avoidable by Zimmerman, if Zimmerman had remained in his vehicle and awaited the arrival of law enforcement, or conversely if he had identified himself to Martin as a concerned citizen and initiated dialog (sic) in an effort to dispel each party's concern,"" the police request to arrest Zimmerman said. ""There is no indication that Trayvon Martin was involved in any criminal activity."" Other documents released this week include Martin's autopsy report and a fire department report on Zimmerman's injuries. The autopsy report showed that Martin died of a gunshot wound to the chest fired from within 36 inches and that he had traces of marijuana in his blood and urine. In his 911 call just before the shooting, Zimmerman had speculated that the teen looked like he was ""up to no good or he's on drugs or something."" Martin's blood contained THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, according to autopsy results released Thursday. The autopsy was conducted February 27, the day after the teenager was killed. Toxicology tests found elements of the drug in the teenager's chest blood -- 1.5 nanograms per milliliter of one type (THC), as well as 7.3 nanograms of another type (THC-COOH) -- according to the medical examiner's report. There also was a presumed positive test of cannabinoids in Martin's urine, according to the medical examiner's report. It was not immediately clear how significant these amounts were. No precise levels on the urine were released. What happened that night? Just before the shooting, Zimmerman, 28, called 911 to complain about a suspicious person in his neighborhood. In the call, Zimmerman said he was following Martin after the teen started to run, prompting the dispatcher to tell him, ""We don't need you to do that."" Prosecutors say Zimmerman disregarded the advice, leading to a confrontation between the two. A screaming voice could be heard on other 911 calls placed by neighbors, with some speculating that those screams came from Martin and others that they belonged to Zimmerman. As part of an analysis released this week, the FBI did not make a final determination either way, citing several reasons, including the fact they came during ""an extreme emotional state,"" that there weren't enough words to make a good comparison and that the sound quality was low and distant. FBI analysis -- Zimmerman's 911 call (pdf -- strong language) Zimmerman claimed, according to a police report released earlier, that he'd been ""assaulted (by Martin) and his head was struck on the pavement."" According to a report from the Sanford Fire Department, released Thursday, Zimmerman had ""abrasions to his forehead,"" ""bleeding/tenderness to his nose"" and a ""small laceration to the back of his head"" when emergency personnel arrived at the scene at 7:27 p.m., six minutes after they were first called. By that time, Martin had no apparent pulse, according to the fire and EMS report. Emergency personnel attempted resuscitation and chest compressions, to no avail. He was pronounced dead at 7:30 p.m. CNN's Vivian Kuo and Danielle Dellorto and InSession's Jessica Thill contributed to this report.","Woman said she heard ""little kid scared to death""

"(Rolling Stone) -- The paintings in Bob Dylan's ""The Asia Series,"" which are currently on display at the Gagosian Gallery in Manhattan, have come under fire for their resemblance to widely available pre-existing photographs. The series of paintings, which are said to part of a ""visual journal"" made by the singer during his travels through Japan, China, Vietnam and Korea, have been compared to famous photos by well-known photographers such as Henri Cartier-Bresson and LÃ©on Busy. ""The most striking thing is that Dylan has not merely used a photograph to inspire a painting: he has taken the photographer's shot composition and copied it exactly,"" wrote Dylan critic Michael Gray in a post on his blog, Bob Dylan Encyclopedia. ""He's replicated everything as closely as possible. That may be a (very self-enriching) game he's playing with his followers, but it's not a very imaginative approach to painting. It may not be plagiarism but it's surely copying rather a lot."" While some fans in the Dylan-centric online community ""Expecting Rain"" have voiced concern about the songwriter's highly derivative visual art, others have argued that ""quotation"" is a part of the tradition of art. Nevertheless, it's a bit difficult to reconcile this notion with the fact that the work has been presented as coming from the rock legend's ""firsthand"" experiences abroad. Dylan has, in his way, been forthcoming about using photographs in his paintings. In a statement in the exhibition's catalog, the singer says that he paints ""mostly from real life. It has to start with that. Real people, real street scenes, behind the curtain scenes, live models, paintings, photographs, staged setups, architecture, grids, graphic design. Whatever it takes to make it work."" See the full article at RollingStone.com. Copyright © 2011 Rolling Stone.","The series of paintings are said to part of a ""visual journal"" made by the singer .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama honored Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Pride Month with a White House reception Monday where he likened the struggle for gay rights with the struggle of African-Americans for civil rights. President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama entertain Monday in the White House's East Room. With first lady Michelle Obama at his side, the president told the cheering crowd filling the East Room that his administration would work to repeal the so-called Defense of Marriage Act and end the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy regarding gays in the military. ""I know that many in this room don't believe that progress has come fast enough, and I understand that,"" Obama said. ""It's not for me to tell you to be patient any more than it was for others to counsel patience to African-Americans who were petitioning for equal rights a half-century ago."" The ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy bars military officials from asking about a service member's sexual orientation but also bars the service member from revealing it, and allows the dismissal of a service member if a same-sex orientation is discovered. ""I believe preventing patriotic Americans from serving their country weakens our national security,"" Obama said to applause. Ending the policy requires an act of Congress and will take time, he added. The Defense of Marriage Act effectively bars the federal government from recognizing same-sex unions, even as individual states legalize them. It is one of the most divisive political issues in America, strongly backed by conservatives -- particularly the religious right. ""We have a duty to uphold existing law, but I believe we must do so in a way that does not exacerbate old divides,"" Obama said. ""And fulfilling this duty in upholding the law in no way lessens my commitment to reversing this law."" He also is pushing for passage of a law guaranteeing full benefits including health care for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender couples and their children, as well as bills to strengthen laws against hate crimes and prevent employment discrimination based on sexuality, Obama said. ""There are unjust laws to overturn and unfair practices to stop,"" he said. ""And though we've made progress, there are still fellow citizens -- perhaps neighbors or even family members and loved ones -- who still hold fast to worn arguments and old attitudes, who fail to see your families like their families and who would deny you the rights that most Americans take for granted. And I know this is painful, and I know it can be heartbreaking."" Obama cited the roots of the gay rights struggle in the Stonewall riot 40 years ago, when police raided a New York nightclub and sparked a demonstration that lasted for days. ""As we've seen so many times in history, once that spirit takes hold, there's little that can stand in its way,"" he said to cheers that turned to laughs when he added: ""The truth is, when these folks protested at Stonewall 40 years ago, no one could have imagined that you or, for that matter, I would be standing here today.""","President Obama tells crowd at White House to give him time to reverse laws .

"(CNN) -- A French job-seeker has ""sold"" himself with an online resume made to look like an Amazon page, proving that some creativity and attention to personal branding can go a long way. Philippe Dubost began his trawl for a new job as a web product manager in late December. Depressed by the thought of sending a regular resume into the ether as part of the usual job application process, he built his to look like an Amazon page, complete with product dimensions, five-star ratings, world-wide shipping and even a gift-wrap option. ""Amazon's pages just naturally fit the form of a resume,"" he said. ""I just thought that if a company thinks that this is fun, then that's a company I would like to work for."" ""At first I sent it out as a link with the normal job applications I was sending, but then sent an email to a popular French blog saying 'Hey guys, if you're bored and have nothing to look at...'"" That was the beginning of last week. From there its journey across blogs and social media has propelled it from around 500 hits a day to over 200,000, and the page has gained over 27,000 Facebook ""likes"". But more than just being a fleeting Internet sensation, Dubost's Amazon resume has also done what it was designed for. From the 800 or so messages he has received over 100 have been work-related with job offers coming from across Asia and Europe. ""Quite a few are great and are really fit what I'm looking for,"" he said. Imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery and Dubost admits that Amazon is one of the companies he greatly admires and would like to work for. However he remains tight-lipped about how the company has responded, or even if it have contacted him at all. As well as being a smart piece of design, the creative resume also shows Dubost's personality, something he believes has helped it reach its target audience. ""It made me realize how important personal branding is,"" he says. Whitney Johnson, author and career and life advisor agrees: ""Personal packaging is absolutely vital"" she says. ""If you think about it, people don't buy products, they hire them to do a job. You have to figure out a way to make employers believe that you're the person who can get a job done. It is not the responsibility of any future employer to figure out how the employee can do the job, it's the employee's responsibility."" Dubost's advice to others is to do what you can to differentiate yourself from other would-be job-hunters and be creative with it. ""Although that doesn't apply for all industries; if I was an accountant it's not the same,"" he says. ""But you can always do something that is relevant to the industry you work in."" The overwhelming response to Dubost's experiment did make him question if he shouldn't take his career in a different direction instead of just search for a new job. ""It occurred to me, and many friends said the same, that maybe I should (do something different). But in the end I did this for a job and it has opened up opportunities with companies I really want to work for. I was so completely not expecting this.""","Web product developer created online CV to look like Amazon page .

"(CNN) -- Jennifer L. Scott arrived in France as a California girl, but she returned home as a Parisienne. As a foreign exchange student in college, she spent six months living with a family in Paris: an elegant couple she dubbed Madame and Monsieur Chic. Scott observed them carefully, took part in their everyday rituals and delighted in the experience. ""Before I lived in Paris, I would go through life on autopilot,"" said Scott, who writes The Daily Connoisseur blog and is the author of the new book, ""Lessons from Madame Chic: The Top 20 Things I Learned While Living in Paris."" ""Paris taught me not how to just exist, but to thrive and make every small moment meaningful."" Here are five of the lessons Scott learned in the ""City of Light."" 1. Live a passionate life . Scott noticed that Parisians often turned mundane aspects of everyday life into something special. ""For example, every night after dinner we would have a cheese course and every night we would have Camembert because it was Monsieur Chic's favorite cheese. And every night without exception, before we cut a slice of Camembert for everyone, he would proclaim it to be the 'Roi du fromage' -- or the king of all cheeses,"" Scott recalled. ""He did it with passion. They turn the smallest things, the smallest rituals and they make them passionate events."" Dinnertime was a great example because every night of the week, whether it was a Wednesday or a Friday, it would be an experience that included a three-course meal and lively conversation, Scott said. Afterward, the family would listen to classical music. ""They never sat in front of the television with a box of pizza and zoned out, never,"" Scott said. The joys of slowly savoring Paris . 2. Cultivate an air of mystery . Scott thinks the French get a bad rap for coming across as cold and aloof when they're simply very picky about who they open up to and how much they reveal about themselves. ""I think we can learn a lot from this,"" Scott said. ""I would attend at least two dinner parties a week when I was there... and I wouldn't really (know a lot about) the guests. I wouldn't know what they did for a living, but yet I would know the best book they read recently or the most interesting film they saw or the art exhibit that they went to. They loved to discuss these areas of life but they don't overshare details about their personal lives."" It's considered rude in France to ask someone what they do for a living, Scott said, so when she returned to the United States she stopped asking new acquaintances this question and liked the way it fueled her wonder about them. She also discovered that staying mum can be ""delicious."" ""Being OK with silence is important. I think a lot of people are afraid of silence in conversations, I know I am,"" Scott said. ""French people are very OK with silence. You can see this in a lot of French films -- there's lots of silent pauses in French films that you don't get in American films."" 3. Look presentable always . Madame Chic wouldn't even go to the corner store to get a baguette without applying lipstick and tying a scarf around her neck, Scott recalled. Looking presentable was a way of honoring the people she came in contact with everyday. ""This isn't to be confused with being high maintenance,"" Scott said. ""She wouldn't spend an hour in the bathroom flat-ironing her hair and applying meticulous makeup. She had a very quick (routine): 'Le no makeup look' and a very easy hairstyle to follow. Her 10-item wardrobe allowed her to pick something really easily. She wouldn't agonize over what clothes to wear every day like so many of us do."" Scott also noticed the family would routinely wear their best clothes for everyday occasions, a lesson she took to heart. ""It's funny, we'll go and spend money on beautiful clothes and we won't wear them. We'll be saving them for some unknown occasion in the future because we don't want to ruin them,"" Scott said. ""We should use these clothes on a daily basis. Why not use our best? I think you should never save your best clothes for later. Use your best now and get rid of anything that isn't up to par."" 4. Don't forget the simple pleasures (and do not deprive yourself) Scott thought the movie ""Amélie"" showed off this lesson perfectly as it introduced its whimsical characters and their little pleasures. ""For some of them it's cleaning out their handbag, and for some of them it's breaking the crust on a crème brulee with a spoon,"" Scott said. ""These are things that a lot of us just mow over in life and don't even notice."" She observed that Madame Chic took great pleasure in making her own preserves or baking a strawberry tart, while Monsieur Chic always looked forward to eating his favorite cheese every evening. Food was a big part of life in Paris, but Scott was amazed to find that she didn't gain any weight. She attributes this paradox to lots of walking, little TV watching and no snacking. ""There were no snack foods in the house and I just did not snack the entire time I was there. So when I went to meals, I was hungry,"" Scott recalled. ""But the meals were long, drawn-out affairs so I wasn't scarfing down this decadent food. I was sitting at dinner and we were having conversation. The meal would take about an hour and I would eat mindfully, so I wouldn't overeat. ""I had dessert at least twice a day. I had it every day after dinner, and for tea every afternoon, I would get a crepe or something in the city. And I enjoyed my food."" 5. Make life a formal affair . Scott was impressed by the formal manner in which her host family lived. They were always elegantly dressed, their apartment was beautifully furnished and they maintained graceful rituals. As a visitor to their home, for example, Scott was considered the female guest of honor and was always served first at dinner, ahead of her host and hostess and their son. ""They just observed these formal protocols and manners and etiquette were very important to them,"" Scott said. ""They used their best china and their best crystal on a regular basis. ... They used the nicest things that they had on a daily basis and it elevated every experience that we had.""","Jennifer L. Scott spent six months living with a family in Paris .

"Beverly Hills, California (CNN) -- Two loud booms jolted awake the music industry executive in her fifth-floor room of the Beverly Hilton hotel. The time was 3:30 p.m. Saturday. The thuds seemed to be coming from the room below. The voice of a man, loud and urgent, followed. It was only later that she learned the news: Whitney Houston, a guest in the room below hers, had died. Cause of death: Unclear. Time pronounced: 3:55 p.m., February 11, 2012. Age: A mere 48. The shock and grief from fans worldwide was immediate: Houston's pipes and presence, her grit and glamour had made her an icon. Fans: Whitney Houston's music spanned an era . For a decade and a half, she ruled the charts: 170 million albums sold, including seven back-to-back multi-platinum ones. Numerous No. 1 hits, including the biggest-selling U.S. single of all time, ""I Will Always Love You."" Emmys, Grammys, Billboard Music awards. Dozens of them. While her luster dimmed in recent years as she battled drug addiction, Houston was in the midst of a comeback. A few shows here and there, mostly abroad, and a movie in the works. She had appeared healthy and beautiful in recent days, said the music executive -- who did not want to be identified because she didn't want reporters hounding her. Just days before, the exec had seen Houston swimming in the hotel pool with daughter Bobbi Kristina. They looked happy, she said. What exactly happened Saturday afternoon now awaits a coroner's examination. Police and fire officials were called to Houston's room at 3:43 p.m., after Houston's bodyguard found her unconscious body. Medics tried reviving her, but failed. There were ""no obvious signs of criminal intent,"" said Beverly Hills Police Lt. Mark Rosen. Medics removed her body from the hotel room early Sunday morning and an autopsy has been scheduled. But the county coroner's office could not say when. ""I just can't talk about it now. It's so stunning and unbelievable,"" said singer Aretha Franklin on hearing the news. ""I couldn't believe what I was reading coming across the TV screen."" Saturday night, fans mourned Houston's death in different ways inside and outside the Beverly Hilton. Grief flows at hotel where Houston died . Outside, grieving fans laid roses and flickering candles on the front and back entrances of the sprawling complex. Some sang songs. Others played her music videos on their smartphone. ""Everyone has their own demons, and some overcome them and some never do,"" said Tya Conerly, referring to Houston's history of drug abuse. ""Sometimes life gets the best of us."" Inside the hotel, music industry's biggest names gathered in elegant attire for an annual pre-Grammy party that had been long planned by Houston's mentor, Clive Davis. ""I do have a heavy heart, and I am personally devastated by someone so close to me for so many years,"" Davis told the gathering of artists and entertainers, that included Tony Bennett, Gladys Knight and Britney Spears. ""My heart goes out to her daughter Bobbi Kristina and her mother, Cissy."" He then asked for a moment of silence. ""We dedicate this evening to her,"" he said. Stunned celebrities mourn Whitney Houston . Houston had been scheduled to attend the festivities. She had performed as late as Thursday night at a pre-Grammy event in the area, a raspy rendition ""Jesus Loves Me"" with singer Kelly Price. The organizers of Sunday's Grammy Awards said they have retooled the show to pay respect to Houston, with the help of singer Jennifer Hudson. ""It's going to be something respectful,"" said Ken Ehrlich, executive producer of the show. ""It's not going to be a full-blown tribute. That's too early and it's too fresh at this moment. It's going to be something respectful to Whitney's memory."" But musician Paul Shaffer said he thinks the whole show will double as a tribute to Houston. ""Here is music's happiest night combined with such a sad note,"" he said. ""You got to be some kind of philosopher to make some kind of sense out of this. I certainly can't."" Sorrow at church where Houston got her start . Houston was born in Newark, New Jersey, on August 9, 1963, the daughter of gospel singer Cissy Houston. Her cousin was Dionne Warwick; her godmother Aretha Franklin. ""You couldn't find a more auspicious template for great expectations,"" said music critic Gene Seymour. In the mid-1980s, Davis spotted Houston in a New York nightclub and signed her on the spot. For the next quarter century, he steered her career and served as her mentor. ""I saw a depth and a range and soul ... that rarely ranks at the top level,"" he said Thursday. ""And that's why we've been working together ever since."" Houston's career: A regal rise, a tragic fall . Her string of Billboard No. 1 hits included ""Saving All My Love for You,"" ""How Will I Know,"" ""The Greatest Love of All,"" ""Where Do Broken Hearts Go,"" and ""I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)."" In 1991, Houston's commanding performance of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" at the Super Bowl, just days into the first Persian Gulf War, electrified audiences and became the gold standard for performing the national anthem, according to many music critics. The next year, she released the soundtrack to her movie ""The Bodyguard,"" one of the top 10 biggest-selling albums of all time. Her cover of Dolly Parton's ""I Will Always Love You"" for the soundtrack has been interpreted by many but rarely duplicated. TIME.com: Houston's ten most memorable songs . She appeared in several more films in the 1990s, including ""Waiting to Exhale."" In 2000, Houston earned her sixth Grammy for best female R&B performance and, a month later, she was named female artist of the decade at the ""Soul Train"" Music Awards. But by then, her battle with drugs -- cocaine and marijuana -- and her tumultuous marriage to singer Bobby Brown were taking their toll. The couple appeared together in the mid-2000s on the reality show ""Being Bobby Brown,"" and had one child together, Bobbi Kristina. HLNtv.com: What about Bobbi Kristina Brown? They divorced in 2007. Brown performed at a ""New Edition"" concert Saturday night in South Haven, Mississippi. ""The atmosphere felt bittersweet,"" said iReporter Moshiu Knox, who attended the concert with his wife. ""Bobby was crying during his performance and at one point had to walk off stage. ... The crowd was emotional and tears were flowing all over the arena."" Video of the concert show Brown asking the audience to pray for the couple's daughter. ""If you find the time, can you say a prayer for me because I'm going to need it,"" he says. In a 2009 interview with Oprah Winfrey, Houston recalled how her mother arrived one day at her doorstep with sheriff's officers and a court order in a drug intervention. ""(My mother) says, 'I have a court (injunction) here,'"" Houston said. ""Either you do it my way, or we're just not going to do this at all. We are both going to go on TV, and you're going to retire.'"" She entered rehab and took a long hiatus. Her 2009 release, ""I Look To You,"" was her first in seven years. ""I just took a break, which sometimes you have to,"" Houston said. ""You have to know when to slow that train down and kind of just sit back and relax for a minute."" TIME.com: Houston's life in photos . She recently returned to a movie set for ""Sparkle,"" a remake of the 1976 hit that was loosely based on the story of The Supremes. It is scheduled to be released nationwide in August, her first movie role since 1996's ""The Preacher's Wife."" Music mogul Simon Cowell said Houston's death is one of those events where you remember what you were doing when you heard the news. ""It's that significant,"" he said. ""I'm so sad for her. She was undoubtedly one of the greatest superstars of all time, one of the greatest voices in our lifetime we're likely ever to hear."" CNN's Holly Yan reported from Atlanta and Denise Quan from Beverly Hills.

"New York (CNN) -- Construction workers bolted the last pieces of a 408-foot spire into place atop One World Trade Center on Friday, symbolically capping New York's comeback after the September 11, 2001, terror attacks. The spire brings the iconic building to a height of 1,776 feet -- an allusion to the year the United States declared its independence. It also makes the building the tallest in the Western Hemisphere and the third-tallest in the world. The Port Authority of New York & New Jersey confirmed the installation in a statement. ""This milestone at the World Trade Center site symbolizes the resurgence and resilience of our state and our nation,"" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in the statement. Port Authority Chairman David Samson called the building ""a national symbol of hope and strength in the face of tragedy."" While the building still has significant construction before its scheduled 2014 opening, the installation brought cheers from New Yorkers, and from people around the country. ""I think it's awesome,"" said Alen Presson, a firefighter visiting New York. ""It shows our resolve. You can blacken our eye, but you're not going to kill us. We're going to come back. So, it's awesome."" ""I'm still taking it in,"" said tourist Joyce Elter of Las Vegas. ""I mean, it was such a devastation back then, and everything is progressing. It still has a long way to go, but it's phenomenal."" The pieces installed Friday morning were hoisted to a temporary platform atop the building last week. The spire contains 18 steel sections and three communication rings. The first -- and heaviest -- steel section was installed in January. It weighs more than 67 tons, according to a statement from the Port Authority. It will be an antenna for a television broadcast facility in the building, which rises from the site near the original World Trade Center towers, which fell in the 2001 attacks. Last week, construction director Steven Plate told CNN affiliate WABC that the spire will be a ""beacon that'll be seen for miles around and give a tremendous indication to people around the entire region, and the world, that we're back and we're better than ever."" Construction on the building began in April 2006.

"(CNN) -- Tennis' year-end championships are supposed to showcase the top eight players in the world but Monday's opening matches in London took a backseat to another butting of heads between the two biggest names in the sport. The difference of opinion came as Stanislas Wawrinka beat Tomas Berdych 6-3 6-7 6-3 in the afternoon and Juan Martin del Potro defeated Richard Gasquet 6-7 6-3 7-5 in the nightcap. Having disagreed about a potential two-year ranking system and a previous selection of the ATP's executive chairman, the latest dispute between Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal revolves around the surface for the World Tour Finals. Switzerland's Federer says the tournament should remain on an indoor hard court but Spaniard Nadal wants it played outdoors and on surfaces including his preferred clay. Federer and his attacking game flourish under a roof -- he was unbeaten on indoor hard courts for two years from late 2010 -- and the 17-time grand slam winner boasts a career winning ratio of over 80% when playing inside. Nadal's indoor strike rate, meanwhile, stands at about 66% -- and the world No. 1 has even less success on carpet. Clay is undeniably his most successful surface, with eight of his 13 grand slam triumphs coming at the French Open. Nadal has never won the ATP World Tour Finals while Federer has on six occasions, with four of those coming indoors -- Houston in 2003 and 2004 proving the exception. ""I believe it should be indoor and hard,"" Federer, president of the ATP Players Council, told CNN on Sunday. ""I know there's an argument to have it on clay, on grass, to have it outdoors -- and I did play outdoors in Houston. ""I just feel indoors doesn't have enough play. The indoor season is small. I believe indoors deserves a huge event, which this one is."" Playing the tournament in such fashion is a natural extension of the European ""indoor swing"" that begins in the middle of October. Prior to London, Shanghai staged the year-end showpiece on an indoor carpet and then on an indoor hard court from 2005 to 2008. The last time it was contested on a surface other than hard or carpet was way back in 1974, on grass in Melbourne, and Nadal insists it is time for a change. The ATP, he says, should be ""fairer"" with the players. ""I know it's not going to happen for my generation,"" Nadal, who stepped down as vice-president of the players council last year, told reporters on Monday. ""I'm talking for the future generations, something that will be a little bit fairer for the players. And I think for the fans it will be interesting to change the surface every year to the surfaces we qualified on for the (World Tour Finals). ""A good player has a chance to qualify for the (World Tour Finals) four or five times in his career, so if during this four years you have a different surface every year, a minimum one time he will have the chance to play on his favorite surface."" In an interview with CNN last week, Andre Silva, tournament director of the World Tour Finals and the ATP's chief player officer, said changing surfaces would make for an ""interesting concept"" but presented some problems. ""If it's something the players want and can be done logistically, it's something we can explore,"" said Silva. ""Even in the same place it would be pretty unique if you have all of a sudden one year on a hard court in London and the next year on a clay court. ""But it's hard for players to switch surfaces. I think guys who haven't played on clay for six months wouldn't be comfortable going back to a surface they haven't experienced in six months. ""I'm not opposed to it but I just think it becomes hard because of the logistics."" When asked about the issue by reporters, Novak Djokovic -- the third most successful active player in the men's game -- didn't ""know what to say rightly."" The Serbian, however, said the championships shouldn't be held in the same city for more than three years. London's stint will hit seven seasons come the end of its term in 2015 and Silva said there was ""definitely"" a possibility of a further extension. Federer told CNN he wasn't opposed to the idea. On Tuesday, the Swiss enters the action when he meets Djokovic in the evening session with Nadal facing compatriot David Ferrer earlier in the day.","Tennis legends disagree on nature of ATP World Tour Finals .

"(CNN) -- It wasn't so long ago that orange fell off the home decor color wheel. After a decade of being associated with popular appliance colors like ""avocado green"" and ""harvest gold"" (ah, the '70s), orange became outdated and was quietly dropped from the roster. But, as Mark Woodman, the president of the Color Marketing Group points out, a color as bold as orange is never gone for good. (He should know. The Color Marketing Group forecasts the colors major industries, manufacturers and services will use one to three years in advance.) In recent home decor trends such as ""modern global"" and the Chinoiserie revival, orange has been a key player in shades of pumpkin, cinnabar, terra cotta, vermillion and coral. ""The beauty of orange is its energetic appeal in almost all of its values,"" Woodman said. Especially in its brighter spectrum, orange is considered fun, upbeat and unique, he said. But even as colors come and go in popular use (orange is already beginning to cycle down in popularity, with cooler blues taking the forefront in design and color news), orange always comes to mind as the weather cools down. ""Fall decorating will often take its clues from the natural world,"" Woodman said. ""As leaves change color, we are introduced to a collection of reds, browns, golds and, of course, oranges. Of them all, the orange seems most to be the last vestige of summer joy. So it becomes a bridge color, hovering between the golds and browns with a hint of the past season marrying the coming season."" Perhaps it won't be so easy to let go of our orange decor as fabric and furniture trends continue to evolve, Woodman said. While orange is the natural complement to the brand new blues soon to be seen in the home furnishing aisles of major retailers, the real future of the hue, Woodman said, is metallic: Think ""copper."" ""It is poised to be the metal to embrace in coming years and will keep orange alive,"" he said. ""In the end, orange has been embraced by so many that we won't want to see it go,"" Woodman said. ""It may step back for a bit and become more subtle, but we will always want its bit of fun and energy."" Want to add orange to your home's color palette? Here are anecdotes and advice from this week's Open House contributors: . Take inexpensive risks . ""If you're afraid to use color in your home, choose an inexpensive way to add color like pillows or bedding. These things can be replaced (more) easily and effortlessly than, say, an expensive orange couch or chair. Using neutral elements like gray curtains and white walls gives a bold color a resting place so that the room isn't too overwhelming. It also keeps the look fresh."" -- Holly Modica, Old Lyme, Connecticut . Less is more . ""Pair orange with cooler colors, and use it more as an accent to add a small dose. It also works well with metals: copper, gold and brass. With black or darker colors, orange can be a bit too 'heavy.' "" -- Emily Clark, Charlotte, North Carolina . Mix it up . ""My husband loves bright orange, not the muted fall orange, because bright orange is represented in his school colors. I fell in love with the color, too, and wanted it somewhere else in our home. I love the combo of pink, gold and orange, and that's what inspired me to paint the little box under our coffee table in that color combination. It is eye catching to say the least. While it's not for everyone, I have to say that I love it."" -- Julie Konya .

""Last year was the first year when most of our production went to export"", Oknoplast President Mikolaj Placek told CNN.

"Detroit (CNN) -- A relieved Mitt Romney headed back to the campaign trail Wednesday after sweeping crucial primaries in Arizona and his childhood home of Michigan to revitalize his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. Romney needed to win both states, but especially Michigan -- where he grew up when his father was governor -- to assert his ability to overcome the conservative challenge from former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum. A Santorum victory in Michigan would have raised questions about how strong a candidate Romney is within his own party. By early Wednesday morning, the Michigan Department of State had posted unofficial results from 80 of the total 83 counties. They showed Romney with 36% to 33% for Santorum. Texas Rep. Ron Paul had 10% while former House speaker Newt Gingrich had 6% . Wayne County, home to Detroit, was not among the tallies, but numbers posted on its website also showed Romney with a sizable lead. The state's 30 delegates will be allocated on a proportional basis, and Romney and Santorum each won three so far, according to the returns. However, it was unclear who would win the most Michigan delegates, which are based on congressional districts. Romney's victory in Arizona was expected and more thorough. He had 47% to 27% for Santorum, 16% for Gingrich and 8% for Paul with 88% of the unofficial returns counted, according to the secretary of state website. The result gave Romney all of the state's 29 delegates in the winner-take-all primary. In a speech to supporters, Romney acknowledged he had to come from behind on his home turf in Michigan. ""A week ago, it was just a week ago, the pundits and the pollsters, they were ready to count us out,"" he said of surveys showing Santorum leading in Michigan. "" ... We didn't win by a lot, but we won by enough and that's all that counts."" Santorum portrayed his Michigan defeat after leading in the polls as a better-than-expected performance in his main rival's territory. ""This was going to be Romney's night. The question was how big. And it wasn't very big,"" Santorum said. The outcome showed it's a ""two-person race right now"" with Romney, he added. ""A month ago, they didn't know who we are, but they do now,"" Santorum said, calling it ""an absolutely great night."" ""The people of Michigan looked into the hearts of the candidates, and all I have to say is 'I love you back.' "" Santorum and Gingrich are vying for the support of conservatives to try to overcome Romney's advantage in spending and organization. The results Tuesday showed that combining the support for Santorum and the former House speaker would equal or exceed Romney's support, a point certain to heighten the competition in coming weeks as the campaign heads toward Super Tuesday on March 6 and beyond. In an attempt to capitalize on Michigan's open primary in which any voter could participate, Santorum launched automated phone calls Monday asking Democrats to support him ""to send a loud message to Massachusetts' Mitt Romney."" Liberal bloggers also asked Democrats and independents to vote for Santorum as a way of damaging Romney's chances of winning the nomination. Speaking to reporters in Livonia, Michigan, on Tuesday morning -- his first news conference in nearly three weeks -- Romney called the tactics by Santorum and Democrats ""a real effort to kidnap our primary process."" He called on Republicans to turn out ""and say no to the dirty tricks of a desperate campaign."" Santorum defended the calls to Democrats at a campaign stop Tuesday in Kentwood, saying Romney used the same tactics earlier when he encouraged New Hampshire Democrats to cross over to support him. A majority of voters in New Hampshire, which Romney won last month, were independents or Democrats, Santorum said. ""And when he goes out and recruits folks who aren't Republicans, that's all right,"" said Santorum, who later said of Romney: ""That's what bullies do -- when you hit 'em back, they whine."" However, it was Santorum who first complained of the crossover voting tactic in January, telling a Minnesota event that ""We want the activists of the party, the people who make up the backbone of the Republican Party, to have a say in who our nominee is as opposed to a bunch of people who don't even identify themselves as Republicans picking our nominee."" He called for closed primaries with only Republicans allowed to take part ""because it's the Republican nomination, not the independent nomination or the Democratic nomination."" Democrats who voted Tuesday said they didn't need much convincing to support Santorum in order to weaken Romney. Bruce Fealk said he voted for Santorum because he's the weaker candidate. ""The idea is to help Obama get re-elected,"" he said. ""We want Mitt Romney to go bankrupt in Michigan."" Romney attributed Santorum's late rise in the polls to his recent ""incendiary comments"" about Obama, such as questioning the president's theology and accusing him of snobbery for advocating higher education. ""We have seen throughout the campaign that if you are willing to say really outrageous things that are accusative and attacking of President Obama, that you are going to jump up in the polls,"" Romney said. ""You know, I am not willing to light my hair on fire to try and get support. I am who I am."" The tough talk reflected the high stakes in Michigan. Romney has led nationwide polls off-and-on over the course of the campaign, but has been unable to increase his support base. Santorum is the latest of Romney's rivals to challenge him for frontrunner status by playing on conservatives' reservations about the former Massachusetts governor. Santorum's hat trick earlier this month in Minnesota, Missouri and Colorado propelled him to a lead in national polls and a double-digit lead in Michigan two weeks ago. But he had a lackluster performance in last week's CNN/Arizona Republican debate and has fallen into a statistical tie with Romney in national polls. Both candidates spent most of their time following the last debate in Michigan, making it the key showdown for both their efforts to establish momentum. CNN chief political analyst Gloria Borger called Santorum's focus on social issues in recent weeks ""detours he didn't need to take"" from the economic message that resonates most with voters in a sluggish economy. To David Gergen, CNN's senior political analyst, Romney's victories strengthened the narrative that his campaign is on an inevitable march to the nomination. While noting it was ""easy to see how Mitt Romney can lose this,"" Gergen added that it was ""very hard to see how any of his rivals can win it."" Michigan and Arizona come four days before Washington state holds its caucuses on Saturday and a week before 10 states hold primaries and caucuses worth 437 delegates on Super Tuesday. Santorum adviser John Brabender, who had downplayed expectations for his candidate in Michigan, noted that the 30 delegates at stake there were proportional, so a second-place finish with a decent delegate haul is just as good as a win. Brabender said Santorum has already won by forcing Romney to spend major campaign resources in a state considered home turf. ""The Romney campaign is spending a fortune they never expected to spend in Michigan, and every dollar they spend in Michigan is a dollar they don't have on Super Tuesday,"" Brabender said. For Gingrich, it's all about Super Tuesday and Georgia, which he represented in Congress for more than two decades. ""I want to focus on winning in Georgia. I think it is essential to us to do that, and we are going to do everything we can between now and next Tuesday to win here at home,"" Gingrich said last weekend while campaigning in the state. However, Gingrich's hopes of building a strong support base in the South after his lone victory in South Carolina appears in trouble. Santorum holds a big lead in polls in Tennessee, another Super Tuesday state. Paul, the libertarian champion making his third bid for the White House, campaigned briefly in Michigan to try to win some delegates, but was mostly looking ahead to Washington state and Super Tuesday caucuses to try to increase his delegate count. ""We'll continue to work in the caucus states"" where investments of time and resources pay off in delegates, Paul said. CNN's Paul Steinhauser, John Helton and Ed Payne contributed to this report.","Romney grew up in Michigan, so a win there was crucial .
His victory in Arizona was expected and more thorough .
Despite his loss in Michigan, Santorum says he performed better than expected .

"(CNN) -- Ever wish that you remembered every day of your life? Cesar Kuriyama did. So starting more than a year and a half ago, Kuriyama has recorded video every single day to help him remember. Kuriyama has compiled this footage into a piece he calls ""1 Second Everyday -- Age 30."" Using only one second of footage from each day, the video shows a variety of snippets and experiences from the Brooklyn-based artist's life. These scenes range from the mundane, such as browsing Facebook and watching TV, to the adventurous, including a cross-country trip that Kuriyama took after he saved up enough money to take a year off from work. Kuriyama sat down with CNN at TED 2012 in Long Beach, California, to talk about his project. CNN: Why did you take a year off from work? Kuriyama: Frankly I was burnt out. I'd been constantly working nights until midnight, until 2 in the morning, weekends and I wasn't getting my creative juices off so I needed to take some time off and after having seen Stefan Sagmeister's talk on ""The power of time off,"" I decided to save up enough money over the course of about two years and took a year off so that I could travel, spend more time with my family and pursue my own creative ideas such as the one second everyday project. CNN: Can you talk about the project? Kuriyama: The one-second everyday project was something that originally started out as a way for me to chronicle my year off from work but really quickly after I started I realized that it was helping me in many more ways. It was allowing me to realize that I could remember everyday that I've lived; it was allowing me to quickly reflect back on the things that I had to done, to be able to zoom out from the past month and realize, ""Oh wow, I sat around a lot this month."" I instantly decided to do it for the rest of my life and realized the benefits were far greater than the amount of work I needed to put into it, which was just a quick second to remind me of that day. CNN: What's your biggest takeaway from doing this project? Kuriyama: It's a very powerful project for me. I really do think that putting something together like this for your own personal life, not necessarily to show other people what your life is like but so you yourself can remember what you've done over the years, could be very beneficial to anyone. CNN: Are there any seconds you would wish you could take back or do differently looking back at those days, at those frames? Kuriyama: The two seconds that I forgot that were black that just said, ""Whoops I forgot."" I learned from those mistakes, those two mistakes are painful to see on screen but those two mistakes basically led to me never forgetting to do this ever again because I can remember how I felt in this moment and that's what this project is about. This project is about looking back on the days where I made a mistake or I did something wrong or I feel regret and learning from them and I found that without a project like this that I'll not learn from mistakes because I'll so easily forget them. Kuriyama is currently working on a mobile app that will allow others to easily compile their own one-second everyday project. More information can be found here.

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama's re-election campaign is spending record amounts of money for online advertising and more than twice as much as his Republican rival, a CNN analysis of campaign finance data shows. In the first few months of 2012, Obama's campaign bought nearly $16.4 million worth of online ads after spending almost $2.2 million last year -- even though he didn't face a Democratic challenger. That means he is on pace to spend a record amount on digital ads, according to ad spending experts. The campaign for Mitt Romney, who survived a heated primary race to become the presumptive Republican nominee, spent $7.8 million for online ads this year, in addition to the $500,000 it spent in 2011. The numbers are compiled by the Federal Elections Commission from reports by the campaigns. Zac Moffat, digital director for Romney's campaign, predicted online ad spending would pick up for both camps as the general election contest kicks into high gear. ""We plan to do a ton more now that the primaries are over,"" he said. The Obama campaign won't comment on its digital strategy. Moffat said that while TV ads are like hitting voters over the head with a hammer, Internet ads are more like using a scalpel. Obama's campaign going to the dogs -- and cats and chickens . When it comes to reaching specific voters, Moffat said, ""you can be a lot more precise with your message online."" Plus, compared with broadcast, online ads are cheaper and easier to track. ""We can show the value of a particular message right away by seeing who clicks through or who spends time with a particular message,"" he said. ""We can immediately demonstrate its value, and we have hard numbers to show a person's engagement."" In theory, such targeted ads can help the candidates better engage with the key voters they need in what's sure to be a close election: the elusive swing state independents, the coveted Hispanic groups, the Catholics who vacillate between Republicans and Democrats. The campaigns buy ad space on sites such as elNuevoHerald.com to reach Latino groups and SuburbanChicagoNews.com to find the Catholics who could vote either way, and look for independents on general news sites such as CNN or e-mail sites such as Yahoo! ""They can find where these coveted voters specifically are online and get their message to them,"" said Kate Kaye, senior editor for ClickZ, a trade publication that covers the digital advertising industry, and author of ""Campaign '08: A Turning Point for Digital Media."" ""It's a major advantage."" Moffat also noted that Romney's campaign, like Obama's, has posted multiple videos to Hulu and YouTube to reach people who don't watch TV much. There's another strong advantage to online video ads: You generally can't fast -forward through them like you can if you use a DVR to watch TV. Both campaigns have already spent millions on TV ads. The Obama campaign spent nearly $13.3 million from January 19 to May 22, while the Romney campaign spent more than $15 million from November 22 to May 22, according to Kantar Media/Campaign Media Analysis Group, which tracks political ad spending. Online, the Romney campaign has spent much of its early money on Google search terms. Type in ""George Romney,"" Mitt's father, and an ad for his son appears on the top of the page. ""Mayor Booker"" pulls up a ""Stand With Cory Booker"" ad from the Republican National Committee criticizing Obama. The Obama campaign is doing the same on Google, but ad buys for both sides may change, as the political debate shifts. When ""Buffet Rule"" was a hot topic a few weeks back, a Google search turned up a link to WhiteHouse.gov. That ad has since disappeared now that the term is no longer in the news. Romney's online campaign seems pretty traditional so far. Type Romney's name into Moat.com, a visual ad search site, and 20 ads appear, most with a simple message such as ""Stand with Mitt,"" ""Ready to Lead"" or ""Vote for Mitt."" In many of the ads, the candidate stands alone smiling confidently, looking off into the distance. Prove Mitt's not a unicorn, group says in satirizing 'birthers' ""What he is trying to do here is essentially show Romney is the strong leader, implying that Obama is the weaker leader,"" said Drew Westen, an Emory University psychology professor who wrote ""The Political Brain,"" a book about the role of emotion in deciding elections. For now, Romney's ads are most likely to show up online where readers may be sympathetic to his message, or on sites that would catch the attention of voters in a particular primary state. According to a CNN analysis of Nielsen Online AdRelevance, which tracks online ad spending, Romney's campaign made its largest online ad purchase -- some $32,000 -- on DrudgeReport.com. The site had more than 5 million Romney ad impressions between January and April. His ads also ran on local news sites such as TheState.com in South Carolina and OrlandoSentinel.com in Florida. By comparison, Obama's campaign spent the most at Comcast.net, paying more than $1 million for ads that have appeared on the site more than 238 million times. His ads also pop up regularly on general news sites such as CNN and The New York Times. They also turn up in some unexpected places -- games.com, elyrics.net and match.com. The images in the 145 Obama online ads that surface on Moat.com stand in stark contrast to Romney's. Most feature first lady Michelle Obama or the president's entire family. There's even one that features their dog, Bo. The messages encourage people to ""Enter to win dinner with Barack"" or ""Wish Michelle a Happy Mother's Day"" by clicking the ad. ""It makes a lot of sense to put Michelle front and center,"" Emory's Westen said. ""She is so much more popular than the president is at this point. It makes him likable to be associated with her. I think Romney should be doing more of this, because his wife seems quite likable in a very different way. It will be key for Romney to share who he is in a real way with voters so they can feel some connection."" Borrell Associates, which tracks ad spending, predicts online ad purchases will make up about 1.5% of the candidates' overall campaign ad budgets. While that may not sound like much, Borrell said it would be $159 million more than in 2008 -- a sevenfold increase. And it's likely that as technology improves, that number will grow. ""What TV and radio used to do exclusively is now something, with the improved technology, that online ads can do very well,"" Kaye said. ""So you can be sure to see a lot more political presence online in the very near future.""","President Obama spent $16.4 million this year on online ads, twice as much as Mitt Romney .

"Washington (CNN) -- Secretly accessing phone records of journalists. IRS targeting of conservative groups. Misleading statements last year about the Benghazi terrorist attack. News headlines of the past week portray an administration engulfed in potential scandal, providing opponents of President Barack Obama with plenty of ammunition to try to derail his agenda in the early months of his second term. The scenario invites comparisons to previous presidents who faced controversies in their ""lame duck"" second terms, such as the Iran-Contra scandal of the Reagan administration and Bill Clinton's impeachment for perjury and obstruction of justice in the Monica Lewinsky scandal. However, a rocky start to a second term doesn't mean certain derailment of a president's goals or agenda. For example, Reagan and Clinton both signed major fiscal legislation during their lame duck terms, noted Howard Kurtz, the host of CNN's ""Reliable Sources."" Despite increasingly strident rhetoric from Republican leaders and others, White House spokesman Jay Carney insisted Tuesday the controversies have little connection to Obama's second-term agenda. ""The president is focused on what he believes the American people expect from him and from their leaders in Washington,"" he told reporters, citing campaign issues from his re-election last November such as economic growth, expanded opportunities for the middle class and immigration reform. In question is whether Republicans intent on focusing attention on potential scandal will be willing to work with Obama and Democrats on such major legislation. Already, the president has seen stiff GOP opposition derail gun legislation he proposed in the aftermath of the Connecticut school massacre. Full details of the controversies remain unknown, but the issues are certain to continue to dominate Washington in coming days. Carney spoke as Attorney General Eric Holder announced a Justice Department investigation of whether any laws were broken in the IRS political targeting. Congress also is looking into the matter, with a House committee hearing scheduled for Friday. The embattled Holder, cited for contempt of Congress by House Republicans during Obama's first term over the botched ""Fast and Furious"" gun walking program, also confirmed that he recused himself last year from his department's investigation of classified leaks that led to the recent secret subpoenas of telephone logs of The Associated Press. According to the AP, U.S. officials have said they were probing how details were leaked in May 2012 about a foiled bomb plot that targeted a U.S.-bound aircraft, and that the Justice Department collected two months of telephone records for some AP reporters and editors without notifying the news organization. The Republican National Committee called for Obama to demand Holder's resignation over the matter. If not, said RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, it will show that ""the president of the United States believes his administration is above the Constitution and does not respect the role of a free press."" Even Democrats such as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada condemned the secret subpoena of AP phone records. ""I don't know who did it, or why it was done, but it's inexcusable, and there's no way to justify this,"" Reid told reporters. Meanwhile, Republican senators characterized the IRS political targeting as a broad abuse of power by the administration. ""I have never seen anything quite like this except in the past during the Nixon years,"" veteran Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, told reporters in an allusion to the Watergate scandal that led to President Richard Nixon's impeachment and resignation. Carney rejected such GOP statements as political hyperbole, but also sought to distance the administration from the roiling issues. ""I understand the natural inclination to try to bunch some of these things together, but there really is a distinction here,"" he said. He refused to discuss specific details of the Justice Department's subpoena of AP telephone records, citing the ongoing criminal investigation of the classified leak. At the same time, he described Obama as desiring a balance between protecting classified information vital to national security and the First Amendment right of a free and unfettered press. Carney also avoided specific comment on IRS political targeting, saying it would be inappropriate until the upcoming release of an inspector general's report on the matter. He noted Obama's remarks to reporters on Monday that if the reported allegations of political targeting proved true, they would be ""outrageous"" and require immediate action against those responsible. However, Carney criticized the continuing GOP focus on the administration's response in the immediate aftermath of the Benghazi attack last September 11 as a ""sideshow that's driven purely by or largely by political interests."" The Benghazi issue has renewed GOP criticism of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, considered the certain Democratic frontrunner if she decides to run for president in 2016. In particular, Republicans accuse the administration of not bolstering security prior to the attack, of botching the response to it, and of misleading the public in its slow-to-evolve explanation of events less than two months before the November election. After the GOP-led House Oversight Committee held a hearing last week on the attack that killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans, Republican politicians and organizations launched a campaign that sought to raise questions about Clinton's role as the nation's top diplomat at the time. An independent review of the Benghazi incident, led by Former Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen and former ambassador Thomas Pickering, found no wrongdoing by Clinton. CNN's Chief National Correspondent John King noted that history shows popular politicians can overcome links to scandal. In 1988, Democrats tried to use the Iran-Contra scandal of the Reagan administration, which involved weapons sales to Iran that funded anti-communist rebels in Nicaragua, against then-Vice President George H.W. Bush, he said. The scandal involved an attempted cover-up, televised congressional hearings, criminal charges and resignations, but in the end, Bush won the presidential vote.

"(CNN) -- Betty West knew that something was wrong when her husband Howard slept through a NASCAR race on television. They had been married 65 years, and she knew he never, ever slept through NASCAR. ""All that day, I sat there and watched him, and I knew something was wrong with my husband,"" she said. When he woke, he had trouble moving his arms and legs, so they went to the hospital. Doctors diagnosed dehydration, gave him fluids, and sent him home. But Howard West wasn't himself anymore, his wife said. He lacked energy. He wasn't hungry. He got a fever. A second trip to the hospital revealed that he had the West Nile virus. ""That's when I knew my husband was going to go,"" Betty West told CNN affiliate WRAL in North Carolina. He got weaker and weaker, finally losing the ability to speak, before he died August 9. ""Just as easy as it could be. No struggles, just gave it up,"" Betty West said of the man she married when she was 17. The United States is experiencing its biggest spike in the number of West Nile virus cases since 2004. Dallas mayor declares emergency as West Nile virus spreads . Howard West is one of at least 26 Americans, by official federal count, to have died in the outbreak of the disease carried by infected mosquitoes. His widow thinks he was probably bitten as he worked on the tomatoes in the garden he loved. She's grateful that he didn't suffer or have to spend time in a nursing home at the end of his life. ""If you got to go, just get out of here quickly,"" Betty West said. Suddenly, a widow after a lifetime with Howard, Betty is now ready to go, too, she says. ""I don't have a lot of desire to hang around here now,"" she said. ""And I hope my children understand. You've been with someone 65 years and you go put them in the ground and a part of you goes in there, too."" Howard West lived and died in North Carolina, but Texas is the state hardest hit by the current outbreak. Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings declared Wednesday that the city is facing an emergency as the West Nile virus spreads, killing at least 16 people in Texas. The Dallas declaration clears the way for aerial spraying to kill the infected mosquitoes that carry the disease. There were 26 deaths and 693 cases in 32 states nationwide as of Tuesday evening, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Spokesman Tom Skinner told CNN the agency is updating case counts once a week after it has analyzed reports. The next report on its website is set for August 21. Dallas County was already under a state of emergency declared last week. Judge Clay Jenkins declared the emergency Friday in his capacity as director of the county's Homeland Security and Emergency Management agency and instructed the department to file a local disaster declaration with the state. West Nile virus on the rise in the U.S. Ground and aerial spraying will happen as weather allows. ""The insecticide is safe,"" Jenkins said. ""The planes are quite sophisticated, and they get the spray to where it needs to go."" The Indiana State Department of Health announced Wednesday that state's first West Nile virus death this year. The death occurred in Vanderburgh County, said spokeswoman Amy Reel. She said she was not permitted to provide further details. Six other cases have been reported across Indiana. Louisiana health officials said the more serious form of the virus has seen its highest level since 2006. So far, six people have died from the virus in Louisiana this year. In the United States, most infections occur between June and September, and peak in August, according to the CDC. ""It is not clear why we are seeing more activity than in recent years,"" CDC medical epidemiologist Marc Fischer said Friday. ""Regardless of the reasons for the increase, people should be aware of the West Nile virus activity in their area and take action to protect themselves and their family."" Symptoms include fever, headache, body aches, joint pains, vomiting, diarrhea or rash. ""Less than 1% develop a serious neurologic illness such as encephalitis or meningitis (inflammation of the brain or surrounding tissues),"" the CDC said. Those at greater risk are people older than 50 and those with conditions such as cancer, diabetes and kidney disease, or with organ transplants. There are no medications to treat the West Nile virus or vaccines to prevent infection. People with milder illnesses typically recover on their own, but those more seriously affected may need hospital care. Health experts say prevention measures include avoiding mosquito bites, using insect repellant and getting rid of insect breeding sites. Symptoms of West Nile virus .

"(CNN) -- While millions of Americans were at home celebrating Thanksgiving Day, Lindsey Vonn was out on the slopes early doing what she loves most. The champion skier raised hopes she will soon be fit to return to action after testing her re-injured knee Thursday at her home piste in Vail, Colorado. ""First day back on snow since my crash and it was awesome!"" Vonn wrote on her Facebook page. ""I'm very thankful for many things this year (family, loved ones, great fans) but at this moment I'm happy to be on the mountain doing what I love -- skiing!! Happy thanksgiving everyone!"" Vonn, who revealed that the resort staff opened the lifts early for her, has yet to make a World Cup appearance this season. She decided to skip the opening events in Austria and Finland, while last week's training crash has ruled her out of this weekend's three races at Beaver Creek, Colorado. The 29-year-old is recovering from new damage to the knee ligament that required major surgery after an accident on the opening day of the world championships in February. However, U.S. ski team women's head physician Bill Sterett said Vonn's first session since her tumble nine days ago went fine and there were ""no issues."" Next February Vonn is hoping to defend her downhill title at the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, while she is also just four race wins away from a new World Cup record. The next opportunity for Vonn -- who made her relationship with golf star Tiger Woods public in March -- is likely to be at the Canadian resort Lake Louise next weekend.","Lindsey Vonn returns to the ski slopes for the first time since her crash nine days ago .

"London (CNN) -- With her lashings of butter and flirtations with the camera, celebrity chef Nigella Lawson has charmed her many fans by turning everyday cooking into a more sensual experience. Her licking of her fingers as she talks viewers through her recipes have earned her nicknames such as ""domestic goddess"" and the ""queen of food porn"" in the British media. But her successful cooking career has not been mirrored in her personal life lately. Her 10-year marriage to millionaire art collector Charles Saatchi has collapsed since photos of the couple having an argument at a restaurant emerged in June. In the photos -- which were splashed across the front pages of national newspapers at the time -- Saatchi is seen with his hand around Lawson's throat. Saatchi accepted a police caution for assault, and the couple announced they would divorce soon after. Now Saatchi is set to take the stand in the trial of the couple's two former personal assistants, who are accused of defrauding them of hundreds of thousands of pounds. They deny the charge. In a pre-trial hearing, the defense read an e-mail from Saatchi to Lawson about the allegedly embezzled money, saying that the assistants would ""get off"" because, he wrote, Lawson was using cocaine and marijuana on a daily basis and ""allowed the sisters to spend whatever they liked."" Representatives for Lawson declined to comment on the allegations, citing the ongoing court proceedings. Born in London, Lawson, 53, is the daughter of a former Conservative Party British Chancellor of the Exchequer -- or finance minister -- Nigel Lawson. Her brother Dominic was formerly editor of The Spectator, a British conservative political magazine. Before she married him, Saatchi ran Saatchi & Saatchi, a leading global advertising agency, with his brother in the 1980s. Its campaigns included the promotion of the Conservative Party under Margaret Thatcher. After studying at Oxford University, the celebrity chef began her career in publishing before moving into media, writing restaurant columns. She met her first husband, John Diamond, while working at the Sunday Times newspaper. The couple had two children. In 2001, Diamond died after a battle with throat cancer. Lawson went on to contribute to various UK newspapers before writing books. In 1998, she brought out ""How to Eat,"" in which she stated how food was an early love. ""I am not a chef. I am not even a trained or professional cook. My qualification is as an eater,"" she wrote. Her second book -- ""How to be a Domestic Goddess,"" in which she taught readers how to feel just like that while baking muffins or cakes -- came out two years later and won her the British Book Award for Author of the Year. Lawson went on to release a string of other successful cookbooks as well as host numerous cooking television shows, such as ""Nigella Bites"" in Britain. In the United States, she's been a judge on the ABC show ""The Taste"" -- due to air its second season from January. She also launched a successful kitchenware range and once oversaw a lunch menu for former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and former U.S. President George W. Bush. Lawson lists her recipes on her website and posts them on her Twitter account.","Lawson fans call her the ""domestic goddess""

"(EW.com) -- 12 Years a Slave may have the most nominations, but Nebraska will probably benefit the most from its Independent Spirit Awards recognition — which give a much needed boost to low-budget movies competing for Oscar attention. The epic slavery drama collected a leading seven nominations, while Nebraska was right behind it with six. Both films are in the running for Best Feature, alongside All Is Lost, Frances Ha, and Inside Llewyn Davis. Fruitvale Station, this year's grand jury winner at the Sundance Film Festival, was honored in a separate category for ""first feature,"" which also included Blue Caprice, Concussion, Una Noche, and Wadjda. The Independent Spirit Awards, distributed by the non-profit arts organization Film Independent, are only a sporadic indicator for the Academy Awards, but can help cast a spotlight on scrappier, more intimate films that don't always have huge marketing budgets. Acclaim for the intense and harrowing 12 Years a Slave has already secured it a solid place in the running for this year's Best Picture Oscar, and Spirit nominations were expected for director Steve McQueen, screenwriter John Ridley, cinematographer Sean Bobbit, lead actor Chiwetel Ejiofor, and supporting actors Lupita Nyong'o and Michael Fassbender. It would only have been a shock if one of them had been snubbed. But Nebraska — director Alexander Payne's black-and-white dramedy about a terse Midwestern family — is only a possible Oscar contender for Best Picture, and these six nominations will reinforce its bona fides and perhaps add some box office momentum just as the movie is gradually expanding beyond a handful of theaters. The film had nods for director, first screenplay for Bob Nelson, lead actor Bruce Dern, and supporting actors June Squibb and Will Forte. The one surprise omission was the lack of a cinematography mention for Phedon Papamichael's silvery images of the desolate rural landscapes. A few films that could have fared better: Inside Llewyn Davis, another movie on the Oscar bubble, which really could have used a director or screenplay bid for Joel and Ethan Coen; Dallas Buyers Club, which was only recognized for its two actors (lead actor Matthew McConaughey and supporting actor Jared Leto), and Before Midnight, which got only female lead for Julie Delpy and best screenplay. Other curiosities among the nominees included a posthumous honor for James Gandolfini's supporting performance as a middle-aged lonelyheart in Enough Said, a best director bid for Upstream Color's Shane Carruth, even though the poetic science fiction drama was named in only one other category (best editing), and a best first screenplay mention for Don Jon writer-director-star Joseph Gordon-Levitt.

"(CNN) -- The use of chemical weapons in Syria is a ""tragic mistake"" but Italy will only participate in military action with the approval of the United Nations Security Council, according to the country's finance minister. Fabrizio Saccomanni, a member of Italy's coalition government under Prime Minister Enrico Letta, told CNN that Italy ""firmly"" condemns the use of chemical weapons on Syrian civilians. Referring to a possible U.S.-led military strike on Syria, he said: ""That doesn't mean that we will oppose other types of action by other countries, but we think it is important to continue to cooperate."" Saccomanni's comments come as members of U.S. Congress are due to debate support for military action in Syria. President Barack Obama says the U.S. has ""high confidence"" that Syria used chemical weapons - the strongest position the U.S. can take short of confirmation. Britain, France, and Germany have said their intelligence backs up the same conclusion although elsewhere, doubts remain. Saccomanni added: ""There is... continuous attention also to the humanitarian aspects of the crisis and I think Italy, like other countries, has committed humanitarian funds and aid to Syria."" Italy's economic pain . Saccomanni was speaking to CNN amid fears Italy's coalition government could collapse following the sentencing of former Prime Minister and coalition partner Silvio Berlusconi for tax fraud. Berlusconi -- leader of the center-right party The People of Freedom -- is facing a four-year sentence and there are fears this could destabilize an already fragile government. Asked if the coalition could fail, Saccomanni said: ""I hope it doesn't."" Saccomanni added: ""It is a possibility, but the probability of it happening is decreasing day by day."" The country is also struggling with spiraling unemployment and a high national debt, resulting in a deep recession. But following a spate of positive data out of the eurozone, Saccomanni, formerly the Bank of Italy's deputy governor, expects the country's economic prospects to improve next year. He said that Italy's new coalition government is ready to restart investment in infrastructure projects and energy efficient technologies to put the eurozone's third-largest economy back on the path to growth. Saccomanni blamed the lack of training for young people, in subjects such as computer science, and Italy's insufficient investment in new technologies as the reason for the country's lack of competitiveness. CNN's Isa Soares and Oliver Joy contributed to this report .","Italian Finance Minister Fabrizio Saccomanni told CNN that Italy ""firmly"" condemns the use of chemical weapons .

"(CNN) -- It's a really good year to be a bold and bad-ass chick in Hollywood. This weekend, ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" broke box office records, catapulting Jennifer Lawrence's Katniss Everdeen to superhero status on the big screen and putting her in the ranks with other megafranchises, including (male-dominated) ""The Avengers,"" ""Iron Man"" and ""Harry Potter."" Movies in those franchises held on to the top three slots on the list of highest grossing opening weekends of all time, but ""Catching Fire"" came in at a strong No. 4 with $161 million, beating out ""Batman,"" ""Spider-Man"" and the ""Twilight"" franchise. And ""The Hunger Games"" franchise is only at the halfway mark of its life on the big screen -- the third book, ""Mockingjay,"" will be split into two movies, meaning there's still plenty of time for Katniss and Co. to fight their way to that No. 1 slot. It's not just new faces getting all the attention. Entertainment Weekly just named Sandra Bullock their Entertainer of the Year on the heels of the success of ""Gravity,"" which is getting plenty of Oscars buzz, and female buddy cop comedy ""The Heat."" Bullock has been acting for more than 25 years -- longer than Jennifer Lawrence has been alive -- but that hasn't stopped the Oscar winner from being one of the most consistent top earners in Hollywood. The Jennifer Lawrence quotebook . ""The Heat,"" which co-starred fellow female favorite Melissa McCarthy, grossed almost $160 million at the box office; ""Gravity"" did even better, bringing in more than $245 million already since its October premiere. But it's Bullock's ability to shift so effortlessly from comedies to dramas to a sci-fi thriller such as ""Gravity"" -- which is basically just a one-woman show, a character study set in space -- that keeps her at the top of so many moviegoers' must-see lists. On the music side, the AMAs were another shining example this weekend that women are dominating. Yes, plenty of men took home top awards, but it was the women making all the headlines. From memorable performances by Miley Cyrus, Katy Perry and Lady Gaga to Taylor Swift winning artist of the year for a record third time and Rihanna taking home the AMA Icon Award, women dominated the show, the social media chatter about the show and all the morning-after conversations. Miley: Confessions of pop's wildest child . Cyrus has been on an envelope- and conservative button-pushing tear lately, with a tongue-out, twerk-filled, nearly nude and super sexy performance with Robin Thicke at MTV's VMAs, followed by an equally bizarre showing at the network's Europe Music Awards, where she lit a joint and smoked it on stage. The controversy is only fueling the fire: Her album ""Bangerz"" topped the charts, making it the year's biggest-selling album for a solo female artist this year with 270,000 copies sold. Compare that with her last album, ""Can't Be Tamed,"" which peaked at No. 3 on the charts in 2010 with only 102,000 copies sold, and it's clear that Cyrus' professional success has grown as her antics have grabbed more headlines. Why we love Jennifer Lawrence . Swift, on the other hand, has made a career out of being the good (but always romantically scorned) girl next door. And what a career it is -- at just 23, she's making an estimated $55 million this year, which includes endorsement deals and her budding acting career. Without licking anyone or humping any foam fingers on stage, Swift keeps her fans satisfied by churning out hit after hit and remaining humble while still being delightfully uncensored. When accepting artist of the year again this weekend, she very sincerely thanked her fans for making 2013 her best year, then joked that she's scared for it to be over. Luckily for her, that shouldn't be a problem -- Swift is already teasing her next album. What can we take away from all of this? While these are all examples of female successes on different sides of the industry, there are just as many big misses. In movies, while many people claim that roles for women are on the rise, studies show otherwise: In 2012, The Annenberg School for Communications & Journalism at University of Southern California found that of all the speaking roles in movies released that year, only 28.4% of those roles were for women. With women making up more than 50% of the movie-going audience, those numbers need to shift to meet demand. A few huge female-centric hits does not a new Hollywood make. From Cyrus' tongue-wagging to Lawrence's aw-shucks-ness , it's nice for audiences -- young women especially -- to see strong and creative women on top. Now we just need to see more of them.

"(CNN)  -- Liberia's president has declared a state of emergency after hordes of ravenous caterpillars infested the country. The African armyworm caterpillar is chewing its way through Liberia's food crops. Tens of millions of the worm-like larvae have appeared in the northern part of the country, where they are destroying green crops like cabbage and collard greens and contaminating the water supply, Liberian Information Minister Laurance Bropleh told CNN Wednesday from the capital of Monrovia. ""I am not aware that they have been here before, ever, and certainly not in this great number,"" Bropleh told CNN. ""That is why it was so overwhelming initially when we first discovered it."" The state of emergency covers the three northern Liberian counties of Bong, Lofa, and Gbarpolu, Liberian officials said. President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf told legislators Monday that 350,000 people in 62 communities in those three counties may have been affected. There are also indications the bugs have spread to neighboring Guinea, Sierra Leone and Ivory Coast, Bropleh said. ""This is indeed a crisis,"" the president said Monday. Johnson Sirleaf said she appointed a task force, including members of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), to identify the species and commence spraying. Investigators suspect the caterpillars are African armyworms, the FAO said. The infestation is ""quite alarming,"" said Winfred Hammond, the FAO representative in Liberia. Hammond said the caterpillars started showing up sometime during the week of January 12 but spread quickly. In just a week, he said, the caterpillars had spread to 50 villages. The pests multiply rapidly and adult moths are able to fly long distances at night, the FAO said. Worsening the situation, the area's water supply has been contaminated by the huge volume of feces dropped by the caterpillars, the FAO said. ""The plague is being described as Liberia's worst in 30 years,"" the FAO said. ""The last African armyworm outbreak in the sub-region occurred in Ghana in 2006.""","Liberia declares emergency after hordes of ravenous caterpillars infest country .

"(CNN) -- Jose Mourinho -- ""The Special One."" Alex Ferguson -- ""The Hairdryer."" Cristiano Ronaldo -- ""The Prodigal Son."" The Oscars aren't until February 24 -- but the latest Champions League blockbuster and its all-star cast didn't disappoint. The intrigue, the subplots, the glitz and glamor of two European giants steeped in glorious history. This had everything. The master and the apprentice ably played by Ferguson and Mourinho. The love affair between the two, the cozy drinks and the bottles of red wine, the terrible children cast as Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney. The best of ""frenemies"" is how the pair are described. If only Ferguson hadn't admitted to leaving his finest claret on the airplane. Enter stage left, Real Madrid -- the nine-time winner of the European Cup led by the man who once wore the red of United with such distinction. Ronaldo fires warning to former club Manchester United . Ronaldo -- all $124 million of him -- is the man who lives a movie star existence, scoring goals for fun, 183 in 180 appearances since his move from Manchester in 2009. Real, the first club to ever break the $650.5 million revenue barrier in a single year and the most successful club side in the history of European football. Then of course there's Mourinho, the man constantly linked with a move to Manchester when Ferguson eventually retires. Suave and sophisticated with his film star looks, Mourinho's departure from England in September 2007 is still mourned to this day. A natural on camera, a wonderful way with words and his ability to charm, made him a favorite with the country's football aficionados. With Real 16 points behind Barcelona in the Spanish league and Mourinho already stating that his next club will be in England, perhaps this duel with Ferguson could be considered an audition. 'I hate my social life,' says Mourinho . If so, then perhaps it is the elder statesman who holds the aces. Ferguson has always claimed that United's three European titles are not enough for a club of its magnitude. Whether his team will add to that collection this year remains open to question, but after securing a 1-1 draw at the Bernabeu, United will retain lofty ambitions. This contest had everything. There were goals -- Ronaldo scoring against his former club -- moments of controversy, world-class saves. Ronaldo admits Real's Champions League 'anxiety' It was pulsating, breathless, two heavyweights of the beautiful game slugging it out at the very highest level amid one of the most dramatic settings in world football. A cauldron of noise and expectation greeted the players and yet, in one single movement of Danny Welbeck's head, the Bernabeu was silenced. Rooney, on the periphery of the action for much of the night, sent in a corner and the young England striker rose highest to plant a header into the far corner -- only his second goal in 28 games. First blood to United . So many had predicted Real would use their attacking prowess to blow holes in a United side deprived of warrior-like defender Nemanja Vidic. But this is Manchester United -- this is a club which knows how to fight, to survive when the odds are stacked heavily against it. It may not be able to match the nine European titles of Real, but this is a club which has made the final in 2008, 2009 and 2011 on top of its three successes. Real Madrid, Barcelona or Manchester United: Which is the biggest club? Real's history and appeal worldwide is well known, but United are catching up both on the pitch and off it. Finacially, United continue to reach new audiences and according to Austin Houlihan, Senior Manager in the Sports Business Group at Deloitte, the club is on track to overhaul the Spaniards. ""Manchester United continue to successfully leverage their global brand,"" he said following the publishing of the annual Football Money League table. ""The new world-record seven-year shirt sponsorship deal with General Motors will double the revenues the club receives from its shirt partner in the first season of the new deal in 2014-15. ""This combined with new Premier League broadcast deals from 2013-14, which will deliver incremental distributions of between £20 million ($31.7 million) and £30 million ($47.5 million) per club, will help Manchester United push the two Spanish clubs above them, for a top two ranking."" While money matters, there can be no doubt that the biggest bargain was Real's decision to throw piles of cash at United for Ronaldo. It was his equalizer on 30 minutes which caught the eye, his ability to hang in the air and generate an unfathomable amount of power to head the ball into the net remains a joy to behold. From there on it was simply wonderful to watch. Robin van Persie hit the crossbar and had another effort hacked off the line, while the much-maligned David De Gea produced an astonishing performance in the United goal, fending off every effort which came within his grasp. How Manchester United tried to drown the stars of Real Madrid in 1957 . Both teams had opportunities, Real might have even been reduced to 10 men had the referee not afforded Raphael Varane a huge let-off for his foul on Patrice Evra as last man. The sequel at Old Trafford on March 5 cannot come quickly enough following this latest installment in the fascinating duel between the master and his apprentice. Mourinho will remember all too well how he danced down the Old Trafford touchline when Porto shocked United back in 2004 on the way to winning the competition. This tie is not over. ""They defended well and the result is open,"" Mourinho told Sky Sports. ""If you ask me percentages, I don't change one single number -- 50/50. ""We can score more than one goal there. They had two big chances in the second half, but chances out of context because we were chasing the game and they were just defending. ""This is the Champions League and there are two matches, home and away. They did their match and they did it well."" United, unbeaten in the past 16 matches and 12 points clear at the top of the Premier League, will now hope to make home advantage count n the second leg. ""There were a lot of incidents in the game,"" Ferguson told Sky Sports. ""We had lots of chances in the match and played some good attacking football at times but we did not get the possession we should have had. ""Real won possession without question, but it takes us back to Old Trafford with a great chance. ""It will be very open. I think we'll score at Old Trafford. We have a big job on our hands but it is definitely within our grasp."" Deaths reported in Ukraine plane crash . In the night's other last-16 game, Borussia Dortmund had to twice come from behind to secure a 2-2 draw at Shakhtar Donetsk. A minute's silence was held following reports that four people died when a plane made an emergency crash-landing in Ukraine according to the Russian news outlet, state-run RIA Novosti. The Donetsk-bound charter flight was reported to be carrying football fans from Odessa to Donetsk for the contest. Once the game did get under way, Shakhtar took the lead through Croatia captain Darijo Srna before Poland striker Robert Lewandowski brought the German visitors level. Young Brazilian midfielder Douglas Costa restored the home side's lead only for Germany center-back Mats Hummels to level late on. ""It is important that we are going into the second leg level and a 0-0 would see us through,"" Hummels told reporters. ""Certainly there were a few dangerous moments in defense, but against such an attack-minded team you can never avoid this.""","Real Madrid held to a 1-1 draw by Manchester United in the first leg of its last-16 tie .

"(CNN) -- Nickelodeon star Ariana Grande has proven she knows ""The Way"" to No. 1. The 20-year-old actress and singer, already famous for Nick's ""Victorious"" and now ""Sam & Cat,"" has spread her wings beyond kids TV into the music industry. Her debut album, ""Yours Truly,"" arrived on September 3 and went straight to the top of the Billboard 200 chart. That not only solidifies Grande as a pop star to watch, but it also puts her in pretty rarefied company: According to Billboard, she's one of only 15 solo female artists whose debut albums have opened at No. 1. Interestingly enough, that doesn't include one of Grande's idols, Mariah Carey, whose influence is evident on some of ""Yours Truly."" Although Grande wasn't born until 1993, the record ""honors '90s-style R&B,"" and stands out as ""one of the most purely enjoyable albums of the year, powered by her lithe, Broadway-honed voice,"" Entertainment Weekly says in its review. Her taste for throwback sounds goes hand-in-hand with a more retro approach to crossing the treacherous boundary between kid entertainer and adult star: Rather than trying to change her image through provocative sexual posturing, Grande seems to be relying solely on her voice. ""I think everybody does what feels natural to them and that's a great thing,"" Grande told CNN. ""If you're doing things that make you feel happy and doing things that you're confident in, that's great. But for me, I just feel like I've always been the same way. And I don't feel like any need to shock people. I just want to sing."" There are inevitable comparisons with another all-grown-up-now child star, Miley Cyrus, who is close in age. But Grande has said that she passes no judgment on her twerking colleague, and believes that everyone else should follow suit. When it comes to Cyrus' controversial MTV VMAs performance this year, ""she looked like she was having the time of her life. ... There's nothing wrong with having fun,"" Grande told Rolling Stone. ""I think all the people who are saying mean things about it and who are judging, need to spend less time judging other people and more time worrying about how to have as much fun as she's having in life right now."" Besides, Grande noted -- she and Cyrus are doing different things. ""I don't feel much pressure to fit in. I never have,"" she said. ""I've always just wanted to do my thing. I have really good friends and good family and if I don't fit in somewhere else, I fit in at home. I feel like when I try to fit in, it comes across as not genuine, and that is not good."" For the time being, though, Grande is easing up on showcasing her vocals after suffering a hemorrhaged vocal chord. ""First day off in forever... Vocal rest and watching movies in with my best friend,"" Grande tweeted Wednesday night. ""For those of u asking about my voice I screamed too much at my party totally irresponsible but it's better now, thanks for the well wishes ... I'll be better in no time.""

"London (CNN) -- The award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the international chemical weapons watchdog helping to eliminate the Syrian army's stockpiles of poison gas, recognizes the dangers and difficulties that the body faces. A team from the OPCW and the U.N. has been in Syria since October 1, and oversaw the first destruction of chemical weapons equipment this week. On Sunday, Syrian personnel used ""cutting torches and angle grinders to destroy or disable a range of items,"" the OPCW said. ""This included missile warheads, aerial bombs and mixing and filling equipment."" Given the danger the inspectors face, U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon this week described the joint OPCW-U.N. mission in Syria as ""an operation the likes of which, quite simply, have never been tried before."" The joint mission is tasked with eliminating all chemical weapons in the country by midyear 2014. ""These developments present a constructive beginning for what will nonetheless be a long and difficult process,"" OPCW Director-General Ahmet Uzumcu said. Mission impossible? Securing Syria's chemical weapons wouldn't be easy . There are many more sites to inspect and the OPCW experts face significant dangers in working in a country riven by a protracted civil war. The U.N. resolution that authorized the mission capped a month of dramatic diplomacy between the United States and Russia. That deal averted an American military strike over allegations the Syrian government used sarin nerve gas in an August 21 attack on a Damascus suburb. U.S. officials said at least 1,400 people died in the attack. Syria denied responsibility, blaming rebel forces. The Norwegian Nobel Committee tweeted that the prize was awarded not because of Syria ""but because of its long standing work."" However, in a statement it said that recent events had underlined the need to enhance the efforts to do away with such weapons. It also pointed the finger at certain states for failing to observe an April 2012 deadline to destroy their chemical weapons. ""This applies especially to the USA and Russia,"" it added. The need to rid the world of chemical weapons was underlined by events in Libya, said CNN's Nic Robertson. Former dictator Moammar Gadhafi tried over many years to destroy his stocks under the terms of an international treaty, but after his removal from power in 2011 and the ensuring turmoil, Libya's remaining weapons spread throughout the region. Arms treaty . The OPCW, based in The Hague, in the Netherlands, is the implementing body for the Chemical Weapons Convention, an international arms control treaty. The Chemical Weapons Convention entered into force in April 1997, at which point 87 states had ratified it -- and the work of the OPCW to implement its provisions began at that point. According to the treaty's wording, signatories are ""determined for the sake of all mankind, to exclude completely the possibility of the use of chemical weapons, through the implementation of the provisions of this Convention."" Sixteen years later, more than 100 additional states have ratified the treaty. In September, Syria became the latest nation to ask to join the convention. It is due to enter into force in Syria on October 14, when it will become the 190th member state. Aside from its work on disarmament, the OPCW aims to prevent the proliferation of chemical weapons through the inspection of chemical production facilities and monitoring of transfers of toxic chemicals and their precursors. The OPCW's experts have monitored the cataloguing and destruction of chemical weapons in countries ranging from the U.S. and Russia to Libya. They have also worked in Iraq, which was the first time its inspectors were sent into a live battlefield. ""We try to get as much information as we can about what we are doing,"" Franz Ontal, OPCW's head of inspector training, recently told CNN, during an exclusive visit to the organization's lab and staging facility in the Netherlands. ""We want to know what the target site looks like; we want to know what we are after. The information we get is what's going to inform the inspectors about the kind of protective equipment they are going to wear."" Ontal showed CNN around the OPCW's warehouse and explained the inspectors' rules of operations. Once they have located the site of a possible chemical weapons attack, the inspectors use special electronic detectors to give them an initial readout of the type of chemicals they might be facing, and in what concentration. Two different machines, using different technologies, are used to increase confidence in the result. In addition to chemical experts, the inspection team also includes munitions experts. That's because they may be dealing with unexploded ordnance. In addition, shell remnants often contain traces of the chemical residue inspectors are looking for. Ontal said inspectors rarely find chemical agents in their pure form, but, crucially, they can detect residues even if only fine traces are left. ""The holy grail for environmental sampling is the pure agent, the agent itself. [But] that might not be practical; we do not expect to find agent by the time we arrive. So we need to look for secondary evidence. That could be munitions fragments, or the delivery device itself, or whatever they used to deliver the agent. Munitions fragments can inform us of many things; they can still hold agent, if there is some liquid left."" Identifying the munitions and the delivery device can also assist the investigative process, by providing clues about who might have been behind the attack. Reactions . The European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, which won the peace prize last year, tweeted its backing, saying: ""Congratulations @OPCW! #NobelPeacePrize is a powerful recognition of your important role in curbing the use of chemical weapons."" And NATO's Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen sent his support: ""Congratulations to @OPCW for winning #NobelPeacePrize! OPCW doing difficult but essential work in eliminating #WMD #CW in #Syria"" Some took exception to the award though. Nadim Houry, deputy director of Human Rights Watch for Middle East/North Africa tweeted: ""I would have thought 2013 would have been a year for soul searching at OPCW not accolades."" And Blake Hounshell, deputy editor of Politico magazine, made a dig at the expense of U.S. President Barack Obama, a previous Peace Prize laureate: ""OPCW owes this prize to the use of chemical weapons and the 2009 winner's subsequent threat to bomb Syria."" Tawakkol Karman, a Yemeni human rights activist who won the 2011 Nobel Peace Prize, described how the award inspired her battle against injustice. ""The peace prize meant so much for me and my Yemeni people and the youth of the Arab Spring who were fighting dictatorship and corruption,"" she wrote in an email to CNN before the announcement was made. ""There will be no deviation or turning back no matter how much violence and suppressions we face and no matter how many bullets and bombs are directed towards the chest of peaceful activists who are full of love and peace. No matter who wins the prize this year, I believe that both that person and his organization are worthy of respect and our trust. The Nobel Peace Prize has helped us to view the future with optimism.""","Nobel Peace Prize goes to Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons .

"Johannesburg (CNN) -- With an international tour at an end, Justin Bieber told his millions of fans he's gonna ""chill"" for a bit. You can't blame the guy. Seems as if trouble and controversy have followed him everywhere as he made his way across Europe and Africa. No wonder he tweeted Monday: ""Glad to chill for a few days. gonna take it easy. that was an amazing tour. thanks to all the fans around the world. #grateful to all of u."" The latest incident didn't directly involve the pop star but occurred just after the singer entertained 95,000 Beliebers at a stadium in Johannesburg, South Africa. Thieves broke into a safe and stole millions of rand, the equivalent of more than $110,000, South African police said. So you can't blame that one on the Bieber, but it's just one more negative press item in a tour that had its share of them. Within the past few months, his bus was searched (yes, a musician's bus was searched!) in Sweden, he left a widely panned message in the guest book at the Anne Frank House in the Netherlands, and he ended up in the hospital after one show and showed up late for another in England. Have we forgotten anything? Oh yeah, a concert-goer in Dubai rushed the stage and tried to grab him. Security took care of the interloper. And the monkey. He surrendered his young monkey to the authorities in Germany. It appears Mally the monkey will stay at the shelter where it is being kept, Billboard reported Monday. Bieber comes back to the States with an unresolved battery case in which a neighbor told police the pop star spit on him and threatened him. CNN affiliate KTLA reported the man wanted to discuss how fast the singer was driving in their tony neighborhood. And KTLA said last week the district attorney in Los Angeles is deciding whether to prosecute Bieber for the March incident, which occurred while he was on a tour break. Police: Thieves lowered themselves into room with rope . The incident in South Africa took place after Soccer City, also known as the FNB Stadium, hosted rocker Bon Jovi on Saturday night and Bieber on Sunday night. ""That was a show! 95000 strong! #SoldOutStadium . Thank u Johannesburg!"" Bieber tweeted after the concert, the last stop on his international ""Believe"" tour. South African police said thieves scaled down a rope into a stadium in Johannesburg and stole the contents of a walk-in safe. Employees had put the money in the safe after the concert Sunday night, said Lt. Col. Katlego Mogale, a spokesman for Gauteng police. Growing up Bieber . When they came in Monday morning, they found the safe had been broken into, Mogale said. ""The intruders broke through the roof of the bathroom nearby, and there is evidence that they gained entry by abseiling down to gain access to the strong room,"" Mogale said. Police were studying closed-circuit TV footage Tuesday for clues as they investigate the theft, he said. Mogale said it was a break-in rather than a heist, as some media have reported.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Broadcast icon Dick Clark, the longtime host of the influential ""American Bandstand,"" has died, publicist Paul Shefrin said. He was 82. Clark suffered a heart attack while at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica for an outpatient procedure, his publicist said Wednesday. ""Attempts to resuscitate were unsuccessful."" The family has not yet decided whether there will be a public memorial service for the multifaceted Clark, although Shefrin said, ""There will be no funeral."" Clark suffered what was then described as ""a mild stroke"" in December 2004, just months after announcing he had been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. That stroke forced Clark to cut back on his on-camera work, including giving up the hosting duties for the ""Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve"" specials. He returned as a co-host with Ryan Seacrest on December 31, 2005. Clark anguished each year over whether to continue appearing on the annual show because of limitations on his speech from the stroke, U.S. Rep. David Dreier, a longtime friend, told CNN Wednesday. ""But then he would get deluged by people who were stroke victims and other people who had infirmities and they were such admirers of his fighting spirit,"" said Dreier, R-California. Share your memories of Dick Clark . Clark's ""American Bandstand"" work, which he began when it was a local TV show in Philadelphia in 1956, earned him the nickname ""America's oldest living teenager."" The dance show was picked up by ABC and broadcast nationally a year later. ""If you didn't go on 'American Bandstand,' you hadn't made it yet,"" singer Aretha Franklin told ""AC360."" The savvy entrepreneur was a pioneer in introducing African-American and other performers to millions of young TV viewers. His audiences were integrated, among the first on television. ""Only God is responsible for making more stars than Dick Clark,"" said singer Tony Orlando, who was 16 when he first appeared on Clark's show in 1961. Entertainers told CNN on Wednesday that Clark knew that music transcends race. ""Dick understood the connection that music had. It wasn't about black, it wasn't about white,"" Shawn Stockman of Boyz II Men told ""Piers Morgan Tonight."" Seacrest gave a statement to CNN expressing deep sadness for ""the loss of my dear friend Dick Clark."" ""He has truly been one of the greatest influences in my life,"" Seacrest said. ""I idolized him from the start, and I was graced early on in my career with his generous advice and counsel. When I joined his show in 2006, it was a dream come true to work with him every New Year's Eve for the last six years."" Seacrest called Clark ""smart, charming, funny and always a true gentleman."" Another major figure on the music scene was too upset to talk about Clark's death. Radio host Casey Kasem's wife, Jean, told CNN that Clark served as substitute host for Kasem's popular ""American Top 40."" ""We just feel that he was one of the most magnanimous human beings that we ever knew in the industry,"" Jean Kasem said of Clark. Clark became wealthy as a businessman, producing successful TV shows through Dick Clark Productions. He created the American Music Awards in the 1970s, a competitor to the Grammy Awards. He sold the company to Washington Redskins owner Daniel Snyder in 2007. ""One of the real draws when we purchased Dick Clark Productions was the opportunity to build on the tremendous foundation of programming that this icon of American broadcasting created,"" Snyder said Wednesday. ""I got to know Dick over the past five years, and he was just as personable and warm in person as he was on television. Once you got to know Dick, it was obvious why he was so beloved by his fans. He was, in every sense of the word, a giant."" Born Richard Wagstaff Clark in Mount Vernon, New York, on November 30, 1929, he began his broadcast career working at a radio station managed by his father. Clark, who was married three times, is survived by his wife, Kari, two sons and a daughter. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inducted Clark in its nonperformer category in 1993. Clark also hosted numerous other television favorites, including the ""Pyramid"" game shows and ""TV's Bloopers and Practical Jokes."" ""This guy was the best,"" said singer Freddy Cannon, who appeared on ""American Bandstand"" 110 times. ""He helped me from the very bottom of my career all through the '80s and the '90s, and he's going to be missed a lot."" Former CNN talk host Larry King said Clark's secret for success was his ability to be natural on camera. ""The hardest thing in the business is to be yourself, and no one knew that better than Dick Clark,"" King said. Singer Donny Osmond said Clark was one of a kind: ""If someone cannot fill your shoes, you are a legend. And Dick Clark was a legend."" Clark's passing follows by less than three months the death of another TV dance show icon, Don Cornelius, the creator of ""Soul Train."" Cornelius was found dead of what authorities said was a self-inflicted gunshot wound in Los Angeles on February 1. He was 75. People we've lost in 2012: The lives they lived .

"(CNN) -- Turkey's tragic loss of at least 47 people in the car bombings in the border town of Reyhanli illustrates vividly that Turkey is not immune to the raging violence next door. Turkey has suffered similar, though far less deadly events in the past year, including Syria downing a Turkish jet, the killing of five Turks in cross-border artillery fire and a car bomb blast at a Turkey-Syria border crossing in February killing more than a dozen people. Read more: Turkey blames Marxists with Syrian links for bombings . It is also hosting more than 400,000 largely Sunni Syrian refugees at a cost of $ 1.5 billion and counting. The United Nations estimates that number of refugees will triple by the end of this year. Moreover, it is a critical staging post and a logistical lifeline for opposition fighters against the leadership of Bashar al-Assad in Damascus. Unsurprisingly, the Turkish government quickly claimed that al-Assad instigated a left-wing Marxist revolutionary group in Turkey to carry out the spectacular attacks. Syria vehemently rejected the charge. Read more: 5 reasons Syria's war suddenly looks more dangerous . Yet, so far, the U.S. and its European allies have publicly avoided implicating al-Assad in the attacks. U.S. reticence towards military involvement in Syria in the wake of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the fears of extremist groups dominating the Syrian insurgency is causing enormous consternation in Ankara. Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan will attempt to persuade U.S. President Barack Obama at their meeting on Thursday to impose a no-fly zone in Syria and to provide ""lethal"" assistance to Syrian opposition fighters. Obama will be sympathetic but unlikely to be immediately forthcoming. Read more: Analyst -- Syrian hostilities bring Mideast catastrophe closer . Erdogan seemed to imply that Ankara's response will be limited. He insisted that Turkey will maintain its ""extreme cool-headedness in the face of efforts and provocations to drag"" his country into the Syrian civil war. This is in stark contrast to Israeli robust airstrikes against what is understood to be military supplies via Syria to the pro-Iran Lebanese Hezbollah group. Obama has, noticeably and repeatedly, supported the right of Israel to ""guard against the transfer of advanced weaponry."" Syria: Attack on military facility was a 'declaration of war' by Israel . Consequently, the Reyhanli incident will probably not be a game-changing development. Rather it may intensify four visible trends of the conflict in Syria. Firstly, the Turkey-Syria 910km porous frontier is increasingly becoming a volatile and chaotic region beyond the full control of Ankara. It no longer affords protection against the instability ripping Syria apart and could in the future be a destabilizing influence to the immediate neighborhood, including Europe. Ankara lacked the intelligence capabilities to track the movement of the two bomb-laden vehicles near this frontier. Secondly, the domestic unpopularity of the Turkish government's stance on Syria may deepen even further. According to a recent poll by U.S.-based Pew Research, merely one-quarter of Turkish respondents favour either Turkey or Arab countries ""sending arms to anti-government groups in Syria."" This partially explains why Turkey is refraining from direct retaliatory measures against al-Assad. Read more: Why Turkey is increasing pressure on Assad . Thirdly, Washington's leadership is indispensable to bringing order and coherence to the anti-Assad front. Neither Turkey nor its Arab partners are able or willing to act decisively without the U.S. leading from the front. By comparison the pro-Assad alliance of Russia, Iran, Iraq and Hezbollah act in unison to stymie the downfall of al-Assad. Fourth, the bloodshed could feed the perceptions of an escalating sectarian fault line along the Turkish-Syrian border. Reyhanli is located in the Turkish province of Hatay sharing the sectarian and ethnic diversity of Syria itself. There are concerns that the exacerbating tensions in Syria might undermine the delicate sectarian balance in southern Turkey. Turkey had boundless ambition and energy to project regional power and influence in the post-Arab Spring Middle East. Reyhanli, and the Syrian civil war more generally, is a stark reminder of the messy transition in an unpredictable part of the world. The opinions expressed in this commentary are soley those of Fadi Hakura.","Hakura says blasts in Reyhanli illustrate that Turkey is not immune to violence next door .

"(CNN) -- Double explosions of a roadside bomb and then a car bomb killed at least 10 people and wounded 40 others near a Shiite mosque north of Baghdad on Saturday, Tikrit police officials told CNN. Elsewhere in Iraq, at least five people were killed and 18 more wounded when a suicide car bombing hit near a security checkpoint at an outdoor market in central Tal-Afar, outside of Mosul, the city's police and health officials said Saturday. Tal-Afar is mostly inhabited by Shiite Turkmen. In a third incident, three people were killed and six more wounded when gunmen attacked security checkpoints in southern Mosul, officials said. In the double explosions near the mosque, the blasts took place in central Tuz Khurmatu, located in Salaheddin province about 125 miles north of Baghdad. There is also a security checkpoint near the mosque as well as several shops, police said. It was the latest round of violence in Iraq. On Friday, at least 21 people were killed and dozens wounded in shootings and explosions across the country, officials say. The deadliest attack occurred in the neighborhood of Dora, southern Baghdad, where twin improvised explosive devices were detonated near an ice cream shop. Officials told CNN seven people -- including children -- died in the blasts and 18 others were wounded. Political unrest and sectarian violence between Sunnis and Shiites have festered in recent months. The U.N.

"(CNN) -- When Ariel Castro was arrested last week on charges of kidnapping and raping three women for more than a decade in his Cleveland home, police also detained his two brothers, showing their mugshots to the world. Police released Pedro and Onil Castro a few days later, saying neither man had anything to do with the alleged abductions and torture of Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight. The men, both in their 50s, are now in hiding in an undisclosed location, as are other family members, including their 71-year-old mother. The brothers say their homes have had rocks thrown through the windows -- one of them was broken into -- and they have been receiving death threats online. In an exclusive interview with CNN, which took place outside Cleveland, the Castro brothers say they are grateful the three girls are finally free and safe, but they are haunted by missing clues and hunted by the media.

"Johannesburg (CNN) -- From inside a small thatched roof cottage, Ahmed Kathrada watched with horror as a laundry van approaching the main house of Liliesleaf Farm exploded with teams of police officers. He and other anti-apartheid activists hiding out at the farm attempted to jump out of a back window. But they were surrounded, their hopes dashed and their plans for an overthrow of South Africa's apartheid government were extinguished. ""The vehicles pulled up that way, and there was nothing I could do,"" says Kathrada, recalling July 11, 1963, from the same cottage he once called home. Kathrada and close friend Denis Goldberg have returned to Liliesleaf Farm, which has now been turned in to a museum to commemorate 50 years since that fateful day. Earlier, Nelson Mandela had also used Liliesleaf as a hideout, posing as a domestic worker. But at the time of the raid he was already serving a prison sentence. Mandela had been charged with inciting workers to strike and also leaving the country illegally. He had been to the United Kingdom and more than a dozen African countries trying to shore up financial and material support for the ANC's armed wing, named MK or ""Umkhonto we Sizwe,"" which means the tip of the spear. MK was supposed to execute ""Operation Mayibuye"" a form of guerrilla warfare against the government, taking care not to target civilians. The plan was being discussed just before the police raid. ""I tried to flush as many documents as I could down the toilet but it was too late,"" recounts Goldberg, who was in the main house at the time. Read more: Mandela's pistol remains a hidden treasure . ""Death was in the air there was no doubt. Their hatred was palpable,"" Goldberg tells CNN, remembering the disdain officials had for them. Police would use evidence found at Liliesleaf, which included a journal of Mandela's travels, to charge him and 19 people found at the farm with sabotage and conspiracy to violently overthrow the government. But the Rivonia trial, as it would become known, would be used as a tool by these activists to show the world what their aim really was. Goldberg tells CNN, ""We would show that the apartheid state was inherently based on violence to maintain itself in power and had to be overturned in the name of humanity and democracy."" Indeed, Mandela knew the power of speech from within the courts and knew there was international media interest in the trial, so he too wanted to show their driving philosophy. In his autobiography, ""Long Walk to Freedom,"" Mandela writes: ""Right from the start we had made it clear that we intended to use the trial not as a test of the law but as a platform for our beliefs."" Read more: Where to trace Mandela's most significant moments . He famously said from the dock, ""I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities.

"(CNN) -- It's hard to overstate how frustrated Republicans have been over the last few years by their failure to gin up a juicy Obama administration scandal. They tried with Solyndra and ""Fast and Furious,"" but those turned out to be gigantic nothing burgers. Well now at last, they may have something, in either Benghazi or the IRS targeting conservative groups. Unlike Benghazi, where even the Republicans claiming it was ""worse than Watergate"" can't quite say what the misconduct was (unless you consider squabbling over talking points to be a nefarious and earth-shattering crime), the IRS affair is pretty straightforward. From what we know, employees in the Cincinnati IRS office singled out conservative groups applying for tax-exempt status for extra scrutiny. If that turns out to be true, then it was absolutely wrong and the people responsible should be held to account, as everyone in both parties up to and including President Obama has agreed. But this controversy shines a light on a larger problem in the way our tax system interacts with our political system. Obama says some IRS employees 'failed,' order accountability . Many Americans are probably hearing the term ""501(c)(4)"" for the first time, but a full context requires understanding two related types of groups. The first is 501(c)(3) groups, which are charities that are supposed to have no involvement in partisan politics; the second are the 501(c)(4) groups, which are permitted to be a little more involved in the political process, with more latitude for lobbying and electioneering. If you make a contribution to a 501(c)(3) organization, it's tax deductible, but a contribution to a 501(c)(4) isn't. (Both kinds of groups are charitable entities that don't have to pay taxes on the money they take in.) In its 2010 Citizens United decision, the Supreme Court declared that 501(c)(4) organizations would now be permitted to engage in ""express advocacy"" during election campaigns, meaning they could explicitly urge the election or defeat of candidates for office. Nevertheless, 501(c)(4) groups are still supposed to be primarily nonpolitical and devoted to ""social welfare."" They can engage in some politics, but it's supposed to be a minority of their activities. Even before Citizens United, however, the law in this area was flouted so routinely that it made a mockery of the IRS mandate to keep charitable organizations from being partisan. Though they exist all over the country, Washington in particular is full of organizations whose partisan political purpose is apparent to everyone, but which nonetheless are considered ""social welfare"" groups. Some exist to advance conservative ideology, and some exist to advance liberal ideology. Opinion: Obama's second-term curse? Not so fast . Everyone in the organization, with the possible exception of the receptionist or the deputy assistant IT director, comes from the same party. When election season rolls around, their efforts turn to the campaign. If the group focuses on economic policy, it will issue reports on why the tax plans offered by the other side's candidate are bogus. If it's a foreign policy group, its representatives will assail the foreign policy record of the other side. If the organization is big enough, it might even be set up as two organizations, a 501(c)(3) that can accept tax-deductible contributions and a 501(c)(4) that can't. They'll both be in the same office, run by the same people. There are multiple organizations that use this structure. For example, on the right you have the Heritage Foundation and its (c)(4) twin, Heritage Action, just like on the left you have the Center for American Progress and its (c)(4) twin, the Center for American Progress Action Fund. Whatever the spirit of the law, dancing close to, but not over, the line of what's permissible in the law's letter is a daily concern for groups like these. As long as you're careful about how you phrase your communication (""candidate Smith's tax plan is a disaster"" is fine; ""No one should vote for candidate Smith"" is a no-no), the IRS will probably leave you alone. But after Citizens United, things changed. Groups like Heritage and the Center for American Progress are large organizations that do many different kinds of work on all kinds of issues. But now there are organizations with virtually no purpose other than influencing elections that apply for tax-exempt status, claiming that they'll be engaging only in ""education"" or ""research."" You may have heard, for instance, of Crossroads GPS, the group Karl Rove and other Republican strategists created to help defeat Barack Obama in the 2012 election. It had a counterpart on the Democratic side, a group started by former Obama staffers called Priorities USA. Both raised tens of millions of dollars, which they spent on dueling ads in the presidential campaign. Yet both Crossroads GPS and Priorities USA applied to the IRS as 501(c)(4) ""social welfare"" organizations, claiming that politics wasn't their primary purpose. If you believe that, I have a bridge in Brooklyn I'd love to sell you. But if their attorneys craft the language in their applications carefully enough, the IRS will approve their application. IRS approval of 501(c)(4) status means not only that the organizations don't have to pay taxes, but also, unlike super PACs, they don't have to disclose their donors -- and keeping your donors secret is one of the chief attractions of the 501(c)(4). The danger now is that because of this affair, instead of scrutinizing all 501(c)(4) applications regardless of the applicants' ideological perspective, a chastened IRS will let more and more applications slide by with minimal inspection. ""Dark money,"" so called because 501(c)(4)s don't have to reveal their donors, could come to dominate our elections even more than it has since 2010. We could see the blooming of a thousand weeds, as everyone who wants to pour money into campaigns while hiding their identity starts a 501(c)(4) under the fiction of ""social welfare,"" and the IRS won't stop them. The IRS obviously needs better internal controls to ensure that it treats all groups by the same standards. But one reason this misconduct occurred was that after Citizens United, the IRS was deluged with thousands of applications for 501(c)(4) tax-exempt status, and many of the organizations were obviously political groups claiming to be ""social welfare"" organizations. If we're going to have a special set of rules for groups focused on elections and lobbying -- which we should -- then we need rules that mark clearer lines between political and nonpolitical activity, and an agency with the will and the resources to enforce them. This scandal could be an opportunity to make the system work better. Or it could cause it to deteriorate even further.

"(CNN) -- Attention, holiday shoppers: Put away your wallets and credit cards. If you're looking for a gift that will please someone close to you, there's one that won't cost you a cent, and that you won't find on any store shelf. This thought occurred the other day when, on a visit to the west coast of Florida, I was walking through a crowded outdoor mall and the familiar voice of Frank Sinatra wafted out of the loudspeaker system: . ""If I don't see her each day I miss her. . . ."" I recognized the song immediately. ""Believe me, I've got a case, . ""On Nancy, with the laughing face. . . ."" It's one of the songs Sinatra cherished most. And what does that have to do with the most meaningful present you can give to a loved one this holiday season? There's a story behind the song: a story with a lesson. In the early 1940s, when Sinatra was a relatively young man, he and his wife were having a birthday party for their firstborn child, Nancy. Among the invited guests were two good friends of Sinatra: the wonderful musical composer Jimmy Van Heusen, and the brilliant comedic actor Phil Silvers. Van Heusen and Silvers wanted to bring a gift. But what could they purchase that Sinatra himself could not provide for his daughter? What the two men did was revise a song they'd been working on. Van Heusen had written the melody; Silvers was the writer of the lyrics. (He would go on to immense fame in the 1950s playing Army Sgt. Ernest Bilko on CBS television, but his talents extended to many fields.) Their song, in an early version, had featured the words ""Bessie, with the laughing face,"" referring to the wife of a colleague. Now they worked some more on it, and fashioned the lyrics for Sinatra's young daughter. They played and sang it at the birthday party. Sinatra adored it; by some accounts, he was so moved by the gesture from his friends that he began to cry. Talk about a gift for the man who has everything: What are you going to give to Frank Sinatra that he will remember? A tie? A car? A bottle of liquor? He needed nothing. But that song, and the effort his two friends had put into it, touched him so deeply that, until his dying day, it signified something achingly personal to him. And now it's the holiday season. We've all read about the mobs of people at door-buster sales, the fights in the aisles of stores. Yet there is a way that each of us, if we are willing to invest the hours, can come up with a gift that will mean more than any flat-screen television or video game. If you're good with words, write the best and longest letter you've ever written to a family member who maybe doesn't know just what he or she means to you. That letter will be kept, and treasured, long after gifts bought in a store have worn out or been thrown away. If you're artistic, paint a picture with a special significance that the person you love will understand. If you're the organized type, gather family photos from over the years, select them carefully, and put them together in an album that will mean everything to the person who receives it. If you're musical ... well, do for the person you care about what Phil Silvers and Jimmy Van Heusen did for Frank Sinatra and his family. Will the effort be time-consuming? Yes, and that's the point. It will certainly be time better spent than standing in line for hours before some big-box store opens its doors for midnight bargains. Because I'd heard about the Sinatra story for so many years, I called his younger daughter Tina the other afternoon to ask her about its veracity -- and its meaning to her family. ""All of it is true,"" she said. She said that her dad, Silvers and Van Heusen were dear buddies who loved to spend time together: ""There would be New Year's Eve parties where they'd set up a stage, and play charades games. Everyone had to participate. They just liked being around each other."" When the two men presented the song at the birthday party, she said, ""It was done out of pure friendship."" Her father and her mother -- whose name was also Nancy -- couldn't have been more moved by the personal nature of the gift. Tina had not yet been born, but the reason she is certain of this, she said, is that her dad talked about it, from time to time, for the rest of his life. And for him, the song -- and the memories of his friends who wrote it -- never diminished in emotional power. She recalled one time in Paris when her dad was in a brittle mood over some things that were going on in his life. He was angry and irritable; at a concert, as he worked his way through his song list, his agitation was evident to everyone who knew him. But then he got to ""Nancy (with the Laughing Face)"". ""His entire physicality changed,"" Tina said. 'He relaxed. He calmed down. The gentleness of the song, and the meaning of the story behind it, did that to him. You could see it. He went from being tense and on edge to being like an at-ease sergeant."" The gift from his buddies did that for him, all those years later. The best gifts are like that. Here's hoping you'll find the right one. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: In 1940's, Jimmy Van Heusen, Phil Silvers gave personal gift to Frank Sinatra .

"New York (CNN) -- The big news in the Big Apple this week may be what didn't happen. There was not a single reported slaying, stabbing, shooting or knifing in any of the five boroughs on Monday, according to the New York Police Department. ""It is unusual in a city of 8 million people, but we never read that much into one day,"" said Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne, who said it was the ""first time in memory"" that the city had had such a lull in violent crime. The violence-free stretch spanned 36 hours, starting Sunday evening when a man was shot in the head and lasted until Tuesday morning with another shooting, police said. For a city that once suffered from high crime rates, Monday's feat fits into a broader trend of dropping homicide rates, police say. ""The city hopes to finish out the year with the lowest homicide rate sine 1960,"" said Browne. In 1990, police say the city tallied just under 2,300 homicides. By 2002, that number had dropped below 600. So far in 2012, police say that number is 366. ""If you think back to how bad things were in the 1970s and '80s, you were lucky if you had a few hours go by where you didn't have a violent crime, nevermind a whole day,"" said NYPD historian Michael Cronin. Nationwide, there were 14,612 murders in 2011, on average one every 36 minutes, the FBI reported. That's a small decline from 14,722 in 2010. In October, the FBI said violent crime across the nation fell for the fifth consecutive year in 2011 with murder, rape and robbery all declining, but it noted that violent crime remains a serious problem in many urban areas. The FBI crime statistics differed from a telephone crime survey released in October by the Justice Department. That report showed crime increasing last year but attributed the change to a jump in simple assaults. James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University in Boston, said many of those assaults described to interviewers were pushing-and-shoving incidents with no injuries and were not reported to any law enforcement agencies.

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- A Philadelphia abortion provider found guilty of first-degree murder has agreed give up his right to appeal in exchange for avoiding a possible death sentence, Philadelphia's district attorney's office announced Tuesday. Dr. Kermit Gosnell, 72, was convicted Monday on three counts of murder for killing babies by cutting their spinal cords with scissors. The next step in the case was to have been the penalty phase, when jurors would have weighed whether to give Gosnell a death sentence. The arrangement erases a need for that phase. ""Like any deal, there's a give and take on each side. The Commonwealth (of Pennsylvania) took away the death penalty and Dr. Gosnell gave up his right to appeal,"" said defense attorney Jack McMahon. ""A big factor for Dr. Gosnell was his family. They've been conspicuously absent, and that's been intentional because of the media focus and whatnot. He has some younger children in high school ... and bringing them all forward for a penalty phase is something that troubled him."" According to a statement from the office of Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams, Gosnell ""agreed to waive all of his appellate rights in exchange for life in prison without the possibility of parole instead of the death penalty."" He was ""immediately sentenced"" for the deaths of two babies. He will be sentenced on remaining charges, including the death of the third baby, on Wednesday, the statement said. A jury also found Gosnell guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the case of 41-year-old Karnamaya Mongar, who died of an anesthetic overdose during a second-trimester abortion at Gosnell's West Philadelphia clinic. Additionally, Gosnell, who is not a board-certified obstetrician or gynecologist, was found guilty of 21 counts of abortion of the unborn, 24 weeks or older. In Pennsylvania, abortions past 24 weeks are illegal unless the health of the mother is at stake. O. Carter Snead, a professor of law at the University of Notre Dame, said that he wasn't surprised by the deal. ""From a pragmatic perspective, it can take decades for a defendant to exhaust all of his appeals from a sentence of death. Given his advanced age, it is likely that Gosnell would die on death row before this process runs its course,"" he said. ""More importantly, in my judgment, principles of justice are served by a sentence of life without parole in this case. There has been quite enough bloodshed because of this evil man's actions."" The doctor's lawyer said his client is at peace now that ""he knows what his fate is."" ""I think, once there is a finality ... there's a certain sereneness about that,"" McMahon said. Gosnell's co-defendant, Eileen O'Neill, 56, was found guilty of conspiracy to operate a corrupt organization and two counts of theft by deception for operating without a license to practice medicine. O'Neill, a medical school graduate, was not charged with performing illegal abortions. Both pleaded not guilty. Eight people involved in Gosnell's clinic, called the Women's Medical Society, earlier pleaded guilty to various charges. Four of them pleaded guilty to murder. A grand jury report from 2011 says the ""people who ran this sham medical practice included no doctors other than Gosnell himself, and not even a single nurse,"" yet they still made diagnoses, performed procedures and administered drugs. Defense attorney McMahon, in an impassioned, 2Â½-hour closing argument, said that none of the infants was killed; rather, he said, they were already dead as a result of Gosnell administering the drug Digoxin, which can cause abortion. Gosnell also was accused of reusing unsanitary instruments; performing procedures in filthy rooms, including some in which litter boxes and animals allegedly were present at the time; and allowing unlicensed employees -- including a teenage high school student -- to perform operations and administer anesthesia. The remains of aborted fetuses were stored in water jugs, pet food containers and a freezer at the clinic, the city's chief medical examiner Sam Gulino testified. Former employee Kareema Cross said Gosnell regularly performed illegal late-term abortions that he routinely recorded as ""24.5 weeks."" McMahon, who called no witnesses, accused prosecutors of ""the most extraordinary hype and exaggeration in the history of the criminal justice system,"" even adding that they are ""elitist"" and ""racist."" Gosnell has been accused by authorities of preying on low-income, minority women. McMahon argued that Gosnell offered access to health care for people who were poor and without health insurance. The doctor was first charged in January 2011. The case has drawn national attention and sharp criticism from anti-abortion activists. Mother shares regrets amid Pennsylvania abortion trial .

"(CNN) -- Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross will wait until an NFL investigator meets with Jonathan Martin before holding his own meeting, the team said Tuesday. Ross had announced on Monday that he would fly to an undisclosed location on Wednesday to talk to the offensive lineman about why he left the NFL team last month. Martin's sudden departure two weeks ago ignited a controversy over locker room hazing, perceived bullying and racial slurs among professional football players. ""We want to get to the bottom of it,"" Ross told reporters in Miami on Monday. ""We want to get to hear what the real facts are. There's been so much said and done to date that I don't think anybody really knows what has happened, because nobody has really spoken with Jonathan Martin directly."" The league and Ted Wells, who was appointed to investigate the controversy, asked Ross and Dolphins' President Tom Garfinkel to wait ""until they have the opportunity to meet with him,"" Garfinkel said in a statement to CNN on Tuesday. ""Out of deference to the process, we will cooperate with their request,"" he said. ""We look forward to meeting with Jonathan as soon as possible."" Martin, 24, left the Dolphins last month because of ""harassment that went far beyond the traditional locker room hazing,"" his lawyer said. Days later, the team suspended veteran lineman Richie Incognito, 30, for conduct detrimental to the team. Incognito said in an interview over the weekend that his vulgar text messages and voice mail to Martin were misunderstood because ""people don't know how Jon and I communicate to one another."" ""The world has changed, with social media and everything today, but one thing that will not change, there will be no racial slurs or harassing or bullying in that workplace, in that locker room and outside the locker room,"" Ross said. Ross, a real estate developer, has exchanged his own text messages with Martin in recent days, he said. ""I would like to hear from him, what had happened, why he felt that way, the whole origin, what we did or what we could have done to really prevent something like this from happening,"" Ross said. ""I want to hear the facts,"" he said. ""From the facts, I can then say 'Hey, were we right? Were we wrong?' and what have you. You can't just deal with speculation, and I will not deal with speculation."" Incognito acknowledged in an interview aired on ""Fox NFL Sunday"" that he used racist and vulgar language in voice mails and text messages to Martin but said it was ""coming from a place of love."" ""No matter how bad and how vulgar it sounds, that's how we communicate,"" he told Fox Sports reporter Jay Glazer. ""That's how our friendship was."" ""For instance, a week before this went down, Jonathan Martin text me on my phone 'I will murder your whole F-ing family,'"" Incognito told Glazer. ""Now, do I think Jonathan Martin was going to murder my family? Not one bit."" While Martin has not spoken publicly since the controversy erupted, his attorney David Cornwell broke the silence on his behalf with a prepared statement last week. Martin tried ""to befriend ... teammates who subjected him to the abuse with the hope that doing so would end the harassment"" -- something Cornwell called ""a textbook reaction of victims of bullying."" The taunting did not stop, however, the lawyer said. He cited ""a malicious physical attack on him by a teammate and daily vulgar comments,"" and a threat of a group sexual assault against Martin's sister. ""Eventually, Jonathan made a difficult choice,"" Cornwell said of Martin leaving the Dolphins. ""... Jonathan looks forward to getting back to playing football. In the meantime, he will cooperate fully with the NFL investigation."" Ross said he called for the independent investigation by the NFL because he knew the objectivity of a team investigation could be questioned. ""We need to look at ourselves,"" Ross said. ""We have to examine everything internally. I know that this is so appalling to me."" But Ross also said he wanted to avoid overreacting. He formed a committee to help guide the changes, including former Dolphin coach Don Shula and quarterback Dan Marino. ""We all know that the football locker room is a different workplace than most of us are accustomed to,"" Ross said. ""Basically, I don't want to make any excuses. I want to know that our workplace going onward will be the best workplace that you can find in the NFL."" Ross said he had ""total confidence"" in head coach Joe Philbin. The only issue that Incognito ""sidestepped and wouldn't answer"" in his Fox Sports interview concerned the allegation that Miami coaches had ordered a ""code red"" instructing the veteran to ""toughen up"" the younger Martin, Glazer said. Incognito said ""legal issues"" prevented him from answering. ""The face of bullying in America"" ""Right, wrong or indifferent, because of all this, you've become the face of bullying in America,"" Glazer told Incognito. ""Someone thinks of a bully, they think of Richie Incognito."" ""This isn't an issue about bullying,"" Incognito said. ""This is an issue of my and Jon's relationship, where I've taken stuff too far, and I didn't know it was hurting him."" A profanity-filled voice mail from Incognito to Martin that has been made public was intended to shock him so ""his buddy"" would call him back, he said. ""I understand why a lot of eyebrows get raised,"" Incognito said, ""when people don't know how Jon and I communicate to one another."" Incognito: ""I'm not a racist"" ""When it's on the screen it sounds like I'm a racist pig, it sounds like I'm a meathead,"" he said. ""It sounds like a lot of things it is not. And I wanted to clear the air just being saying that I'm a good person."" He acknowledged using the n-word in his communications with Martin, who is African-American. ""I'm not a racist and to judge me by that one word is wrong,"" Incognito said. ""It, in no way, shape or form, is ever acceptable for me to use that word, even if it's friend to friend in a voice mail."" He said ""it was a joke."" The word is ""thrown around a lot"" in NFL locker rooms and it's ""a word that I've heard Jon use a lot,"" he said. ""There's a lot of colorful words thrown around in the locker room that we don't use in everyday life."" Martin was his ""best friend"" on the team, Incognito said. ""You can ask anybody in the Miami Dolphins' locker room, who had Jon Martin's back the absolute most, and they'll undoubtedly tell you me,"" he said. Incognito said he was ""miffed"" by ""how I missed this and I never saw it coming."" Glazer asked Incognito what he would say to his former teammate today if he were in the room. ""I think I would give him a big hug right now, because we've been through so much and I'd be like 'Dude, what's going on? Why didn't you come to me?'"" he said. ""If he were to say 'listen, you took it way too far, you hurt me.' You know, I would just apologize and explain to him exactly what I explained to you. And I would apologize to his family that they took it as malicious. But I never meant it that way.""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The portrait of Michael Jackson in the last week of his life, painted by people close to him, is a disturbing picture of an emaciated man, unable to sleep or eat, and unlikely to be ready for his comeback concerts just days away. ""Oh, my God, Turkle, I can see Michael's heart beat through the skin in his chest,"" stylist Michael Bush said after a costume fitting six days before his death on June 19, 2009. Turkle is the nickname of makeup artist Karen Faye, who testified Thursday and Friday in Jackson's wrongful death trial. Her testimony has been the most dramatic so far. Proceedings continue Monday with choreographer Stacy Walker on the witness stand. ""Get him a bucket of chicken,"" manager Frank DiLeo said in reply to concerns about Jackson's weight loss, Faye testified. ""It was such a cold response, it broke my heart,"" Faye said through tears. Witness: Jackson was paranoid, talking to himself in last days . Michael Jackson's mother and three children contend concert promoter AEG Live is liable in Jackson's death because its executives ignored his health problem and pressured him to prepare for his ""This Is It"" shows set to debut in London in July 2009. AEG Live negligently hired, retained and supervised Dr. Conrad Murray, who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the pop icon's death, according to the Jackson's lawsuit. The coroner blamed Jackson's June 25, 2009 death on an overdose of propofol, combined with sedatives, given to him by Dr. Murray as a treatment for insomnia. AEG lawyers contend that it was Jackson, and not AEG, who hired and supervised Dr. Murray, and that he was responsible for his own decisions. They said these were influenced by a drug addiction its executives did not and could not be expected to know about. Witness: ""Everybody was lying after he died"" The Michael Jackson the public saw in the documentary ""This Is It"" -- produced months after his death with 80 hours of video shot during his last rehearsals -- is not reality, Faye said. She was asked to help retouch the video to make Jackson look healthier on the big screen, she testified. But she refused. ""It was a lie. I didn't want to lie,"" Faye said. ""Everybody was lying after he died, saying that Michael was well, and everybody knew he wasn't. I felt that retouching Michael was just a part of that lie."" Before Faye testified, jurors heard a similarly disturbing description of Jackson in his final days from ""This Is It"" associate producer Alif Sankey. Jackson ""was not speaking normally"" at the June 19 costume fitting, Sankey said. She and producer Kenny Ortega cried after he left because of his appearance and what he said. ""God keeps talking to me,"" Jackson told Ortega, Sankey testified. Faye said Jackson seemed ""frightened,"" and he was talking to himself, repeating ""the same thing over and over again."" ""He kept repeating, 'Why can't I choose?'"" she said. Jackson was shivering from chills, and it was ""like I was touching ice"" when she put on his makeup, Faye testified. Faye said she raised her concerns with AEG Live CEO Randy Phillips. He told her, ""Yeah, this is bad. It's not so good. I had to scrape Michael off the floor in London ... because he was so drunk,"" she said. The Jackson family's legal representation contends Phillips should have gotten Jackson medical care from someone other than Murray. Sankey, who knew Jackson since she first danced with him in 1987, said she screamed at Ortega in a phone call after the June 19 rehearsal, begging that he get help for Jackson. ""I kept saying that 'Michael is dying, he's dying, he's leaving us, he needs to be put in a hospital,'"" Sankey said. ""'Please do something. Please, please.' I kept saying that. I asked him why no one had seen what I had seen. He said he didn't know."" Michael Jackson defender files sex abuse claim . Debbie Rowe was ""in love with Michael"" The trial, which enters its third week Monday, could offer more previously unpublicized insights into Jackson's life and death. Along with his oldest children Prince and Paris Jackson, his ex-wife and their mother, Debbie Rowe, is scheduled to testify. Faye's testimony on Friday offered a glimpse at Jackson's relationship with Rowe, suggesting there was romance involved, or at least jealously. Faye said that after she was fired from her job during Jackson's ""History"" tour in 1997, she learned it was because Rowe felt threatened by her relationship with Jackson. ""She was obviously in love with Michael,"" Faye said. ""She had told me for many years that it was her desire to be with him."" Rowe later apologized to her for asking Jackson's manager to let her go, she testified. ""She told me she was jealous of me,"" Faye said. ""She thought that Michael liked me better.""

"(CNN) -- Health officials reported four more cases of a dangerous new virus in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. Three of the patients diagnosed as having the novel coronavirus, or nCoV, are still being treated, a statement on the Saudi Health Ministry website said.

"(CNN) -- In the three days since Disney crowned its 11th official princess and people got a glimpse of the ""new"" Merida -- Disney's doll version of the fire-haired heroine of the Oscar-winning animated film ""Brave"" -- there's been much uproar. The princess-ified Merida aimed at the merchandising market is hippier, her neckline a little more plunging and off-the-shoulder than it was in the film. Her features are softer. And is that lipstick she's wearing? Disney was quickly taken to task by many, including the film's writer and co-director Brenda Chapman, who called the makeover a ""blatantly sexist marketing move based on money"" that strips the character of her place as a ""better, stronger role model ... something of substance, not just a pretty face that waits around for romance."" The implication, of course, being that pretty girls can't be role models. Or have substance. Let me be clear: As a female heroine, Merida was revolutionary, and we should have more like her. Increasingly, we do. Disney's Mulan -- the female warrior from its 1998 animated film -- was one, in fact. And indeed, in the film, Merida's best features were the ones that had nothing to do with her body, her face or her outfits. She was outspoken and unafraid, independent and empowered. She stood up for herself and others. She carried a bow and arrow, and she knew how to use it -- far more skillfully than the boys, besides. She was perfectly subversive as a princess for all the reasons that had nothing to do with her looks. (Though let's be honest: Her wild mane of red hair could not have meant to be anything but ravishing.) At the same time, she was undeniably sexy, if you consider strong women sexy -- and don't we? Dolls are built on the notion of fantasy. They are not true to life -- but even less true, by nature of their technical limitations, than cartoons, which benefit from animation that's often so precise as to appear real. As toys, dolls take on many of the characteristics that the child playing with them chooses to impart. Part of parenting is to help children explore the many options that life offers, to tap into the vast reaches of their imagination, but also to know the difference between what's fiction and fantasy and what's reality. And dolls, perhaps more than most toys for children, are not meant to be taken at face value. Otherwise, we'd be making the case for legions of 8-year-olds to be running around suburban America with bows and arrows. And that's not, I don't think, the point Chapman was trying to make in her movie. The reality is that in deciding to make some changes to Merida, Disney probably was thinking about money. How corporate America works is a conversation for another day. But more poignantly, moneymaking is how Disney, and others, help new films get made -- and yes, even the progressive ones. Disney's Princess Merida doesn't take away from the positive message that ""Brave"" put forth: Lipstick or no, she's still the same girl inside. But Chapman's argument does -- by bringing the focus back to Merida's looks in a way that's exclusionary of all else. The fact is that ""babes"" can be worthwhile role models, too, and no less so than those women whose looks are more rough and tumble. What's sexist, polarizing -- and most damaging -- is the suggestion that women can be only one or the other: pretty or powerful. Vulnerable or strong. Pink wearing or substantive. These are incorrect messages that serve to confuse and contain. Instead, the message should be about how these days, women can be many things. Girls -- and boys -- are listening. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Peggy Drexler.","Peggy Drexler: Disney retooled Princess Merida from ""Brave"" movie as ""babe"" for doll .

"(CNN) -- One question that policymakers might have overlooked in trying to come up with a long-term strategy toward North Korea is this: Could the Hermit Kingdom be the next Myanmar? Myanmar, widely known by its former name of Burma, was once a pariah, but it has surprised almost everyone by becoming a Western investor's dream. While there are significant differences between Myanmar and North Korea, there are similarities that prompt the same Southeast Asian investors who correctly predicted Myanmar's turnaround to be optimistic about North Korea's future. Until recently, Myanmar's only ally was China. For over a decade, the international community placed sanctions on Myanmar for its human rights violations, including the house arrest of the prominent activist Aung San Suu Kyi. But the junta drastically changed direction and endorsed a U.S. road map for reform -- a process that led to the U.S. lifting its export ban in September. Today, an emancipated Suu Kyi is working with the new government on reforms, and Westerners carrying suitcases of cash (sometimes literally) are looking to invest in the country. There are many good reasons to turn to Myanmar. The country has plenty of fertile land for agriculture, an abundance of precious stones and large reserves of oil, gas, coal and metals. Office rentals in some parts of Yangon, the former capital, exceed those in central Tokyo. Children who used to beg on the streets have been spotted selling copies of the investment law (in Burmese and English). Myanmar's transformation is partly because of the leadership realizing that overreliance on China jeopardized the country's national security. The government prioritized diversifying its trading counterparts, and the detente began. An over-dependence on China could become a big issue for North Korea, too. China props up North Korea with aid and diplomatic support. According to the Council on Foreign Relations, the Middle Kingdom provides North Korea most of its energy needs and consumer goods and nearly half of its food supplies. But despite the support, the North Korean leadership often ignores Beijing's requests. North Korea conducted its third nuclear test in February despite China publicly asking it not to so. Economic and political pressures do not work well on North Korea's leadership because its central ideology of Juche, translated as ""self-reliance,"" produces a very negative reaction to outside pressure. This stems from an underdog psyche resulting from centuries of kowtowing to strong Chinese and Japanese neighbors. When the regime feels provoked, it often acts in the opposite direction to demonstrate its independence. For China, being ignored by North Korea is an embarrassment. China's strategy is a combination of reprimand with ongoing economic engagement, hoping that its influence will change North Korea's mind. Meanwhile, North Korea's leadership is aware of its ever-increasing reliance on China, and the Juche ideology may catalyze diversification -- as in Myanmar. And like Myanmar, North Korea would have an appeal to investors. It, too, has large deposits of undeveloped mineral wealth, estimated by the South Korean government to be worth $6 trillion. The country also boasts a cheap labor force, with even higher literacy rates than Myanmar. There is one big difference between the two countries -- the attitude of the people toward the West. Even when the U.S. had sanctions on Myanmar, the people weren't taught to hate America. A steady stream of propaganda, however, has left North Koreans with a negative view of the United States. But the recent celebrated visits of Americans such as Google Chairman Eric Schmidt and former NBA Star Dennis Rodman show the appeal the U.S. still has -- and the soft power it can leverage. While the State Department criticized Schmidt, saying the timing wasn't ""particularly helpful,"" the timing was in fact telling. Even while going head-to-head with the U.S. on the world stage, a representative of U.S. capitalism was heralded inside North Korea. Of course, soft power strategies are difficult to employ while tensions are high. Since the nuclear test in February, North Korea has threatened to strike at U.S. bases in Asia. It has closed the joint North-South Kaesong Industrial Zone and declared a state of war with South Korea. These are actions that cannot be ignored. But in deciding a response, it's important to understand how the leadership is thinking -- and what the future could hold. In the meantime, it's the China-North Korea relationship that the savviest of Southeast Asia investors are watching most closely. Maybe North Korea could learn valuable lessons from Myanmar. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Kim and Daniel Freedman.","John Kim and Daniel Freedman: Could the Hermit Kingdom be the next Myanmar?
Kim, Freedman: Myanmar surprised everyone by its reforms, and Western investors responded .
They say North Korean leadership may not want to rely solely on China for its needs .

"(CNN) -- With one child dead and the second arrested in her death, a California woman pleaded for a bit of privacy on Mother's Day. Crystal Walters posted a brief message on Facebook on Sunday, the day after sheriff's investigators in Calaveras County announced the arrest of her 12-year-old stepson on a homicide charge in the death of her 8-year-old stepdaughter, Leila Fowler. ""I don't have much to say but thank you to those who are standing by us in this devastating time for our family,"" Walters said in a brief post on Facebook. ""And thank you for respecting our privacy during this time. We need a little space. Happy mothers day to all."" Leila Fowler was stabbed April 27 in the family's northern California home. The 12-year-old boy told police he'd seen an intruder leaving the home. But Saturday, police announced the boy had been arrested. ""Citizens of Calaveras County can sleep a little better tonight,"" Sheriff Gary Kuntz said. The death of young Leila, known for her bubbly personality, shook the small town of Valley Springs, where purple ribbons, in Leila's favorite color, were tied to stop signs. After the killing, police offered a sketchy description of the suspect as a 6-foot-tall white or Hispanic male with a muscular build. They also interviewed registered sex offenders in the area, ran down leads and searched in attics, storage sheds and more in the rural, mountainous community located about 60 miles southeast of Sacramento. Kuntz said law enforcement officers ""put over 2000 hours into this investigation to provide Leila Fowler's family with answers in her death."" Hundreds flock to vigil for slain girl . He declined to answer questions after Saturday evening's announcement and didn't specify the exact charges against the brother, where he is being held or when he will appear in court.","Leila Fowler was stabbed to death in April .

"(CNN) -- Critics and a growing number of fans call Richard Lange an up-and-coming name in crime fiction, but don't tell him that. ""I don't even call myself a crime writer,"" Lange recently said. ""I'll take the title but I would call myself more of a grime writer because my novels always seem to end up on the grimy end of the spectrum."" The award-winning author's new noir novel, ""Angel Baby,"" is hitting stores this week. The story is set in the criminal underworld of Tijuana and Southern California, but to Lange, it's more than just another crime tale -- it's a way to explore how humans interact. ""Angel Baby"" is intense, extreme and definitely grimy and readers will find that's a good thing. In the book, Luz, the trophy wife of a vicious drug lord called ""El Principe"" goes on the run from her prisoner-like life in Tijuana. She steals a gun and a pile of cash from her husband and flees for the border, hoping to sneak into the United States and find the daughter she left behind years ago. Along the way, she gets help from an alcoholic ex-surfer, all while a crooked border patrol officer and a scary hit man nicknamed ""El Apache"" try to track her down. The story is thrilling and cinematic, told as one long chase scene. Lange says that's by design, ""I wanted to tell this compelling tale, a chase, that begins in chapter one and carries readers along with it to the final page."" Beyond the basic plot, Lange inhabits his novel's characters. There's no pure black and white to them, only varying and unexpected shades of gray. Must-read books for May . ""Even the worst characters in the book, the villains and the bad guys, I always try and give them some human element that makes them recognizable to people. You might not agree with their motivations but I try to make the reader understand them,"" Lange said. Lange compares his writing process to that of an actor, working out a backstory, delving into psychological motivations so each character can develop a voice. ""If you've done a good enough job they will surprise you,"" he said, ""and if it surprises you, it will surprise the reader."" Readers will also enjoy Lange's dangerous and desperate portrayal of Tijuana, what he lovingly describes as ""a wild west town."" The dichotomy of a former tourist hot spot was part of what sparked him to write the book. ""It's possibly the quintessential border town. There's smuggling going on there, both human and drugs. There's a sense of lawlessness,"" Lange said. ""What fascinated me was here you have all this poverty and then right across the border you can actually see these nice new subdivisions going up on the hills on the American side overlooking Tijuana. I had this idea of these people sort of trapped there. It just seemed a very rich terrain."" This is only his third published book -- his second novel -- and he believes he can only get better. ""In a way every novel is a failed project because it never lives up to what's in your head. You can never get everything down on paper,"" he said. Novelist loses a dog, finds a heroine in 'Suspect' Lange is a 2009 winner of a Guggenheim fellowship, a former magazine editor turned full-time writer. He's a fan of writers as diverse as Elmore Leonard and Raymond Carver. He's also a self-described adrenaline junkie and a long time Los Angeles resident. He loves his hometown, calling it a wild place to live, with a very real air of danger. ""I saw a guy get shot two blocks from my house last year. I was out eating at a pizza parlor and across the street we hear POW, POW, POW, 'Look out!' It was a gang shooting, two guys in hoodies go running up the street and a guy was dead on the sidewalk,"" he said. Despite the danger, Lange said he couldn't live anywhere else. He's already hard at work on his next novel, also set in the criminal underworld. It's only in the early stages but it's the story of a con man. Become a 'Mastermind' with Sherlock Holmes' help . Lange said he's enjoying his new fans and all the critical praise. ""I'm extremely happy about any accolades I get because the book business is extremely hard right now, so every little bit helps,"" he said. Lange is also ""taking meetings"" with people from Hollywood about possible future film or television projects, but adds, ""I don't let my head get too swollen with dreams of Hollywood glamor. My bread and butter are the books. That's what I most enjoy."" Crime fiction fans will enjoy ""Angel Baby"" for now and fans can look forward to more of Lange's ""grime"" in the future.

"(CNN) -- Angelina Jolie stunned many people with an op-ed Tuesday describing her reasons for choosing to have a preventive double mastectomy. Her mother passed away at the age of 56 after battling ovarian cancer. Moreover, Jolie found that she had the BRCA1 gene, which significantly increases the lifetime risk of breast cancer. In fact, she reports that her doctors estimated that she had an 87% chance of developing breast cancer. I have no doubt that this piece is causing many women across the country to think about their own health and chances of developing the disease. Thanks to many successful organizations, breast cancer awareness is at an all-time high in the United States. A person of Jolie's stature publicly discussing such a personal and difficult decision will likely weigh on the minds of many women who have similar concerns. Breast cancer is a real disease, it's not rare, and it can potentially strike almost anyone. I have no doubt that her op-ed in The New York Times will help many women who would not have considered this procedure to do so now. Five reasons we love Angelina Jolie . In one sense, that is a good thing. There are legitimate and real reasons for some women to consider a preventive, or prophylactic, mastectomy. Some women who have had breast cancer in one breast elect to have a mastectomy of the other breast to prevent the cancer from spreading there. Some women who have a family history of cancer, especially before age 50, might consider the procedure. More recently, women who have been able to learn through genetic testing that they have the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene, both of which make it more likely that they might develop cancer, have been given new information that may help them make a decision. It's a personal decision. It's also a serious one, because there are downsides to a preventive mastectomy as well. First of all, it's still a major procedure, and it carries all the risks of one; one should never minimize the risks of a big operation. It's also irreversible, and some women do suffer psychological or physical consequences afterward. No one should ever judge another woman's decision in this area, but it would serve individual patients poorly for doctors not to discuss with them both the potential harms as well as benefits. Opinion: Angelina Jolie's brave message . It's also important to recognize that even a preventive mastectomy is not a guarantee against cancer. Studies show that it's about 90% effective in preventing breast cancer in moderate and high-risk women. That still leaves a 10% chance of developing cancer in the chest wall, armpit or even in the abdomen. That's because it's pretty much impossible for even the best surgeon to remove all breast tissue from a woman. Because of this, some women choose not to have the procedure done, even when they are at high risk. Just a few weeks ago, Peggy Orenstein wrote a compelling account of her decision not to undergo the procedure after her first brush with breast cancer. Her reasons are just as valid and important as Jolie's but may not make the same splash in our national discussion. Part of the reason for that is that there are few stars with Jolie's fame who could claim this sort of attention. But there's a larger current here that is worth considering. We in America sometimes are risk averse. We favor trying to reduce the chance of something bad happening to as close to zero as possible. We also tend to err on the side of doing something rather than nothing. There's nothing inherently wrong with this type of behavior. But we should recognize it. My preventive mastectomy: Staying alive for my kids . We tend to screen more than other countries. We tend to push for more invasive and technologically driven solutions. We do these things, sometimes, at the expense of both health and money. In the last few years, there has been some pushback against the potential over-use (and detriment) of mammograms and prostate specific antigen tests. Such debates are controversial but important. You can't reduce risk to nothing. Trying to do so will lead to practices none of us would support. After all, someone could make the argument that we should remove all breast tissue from all women because you never know where breast cancer will strike. That's hyperbolic, and no one is suggesting it, but it shows that this is really a personal, and individual decision. That's how it should be. Jolie's relating her decision to have a preventive mastectomy is no more or less brave than Orenstein's decision not to have one. But both are welcome in their bringing to the forefront that these are discussions that every woman should have with their physicians, their loved ones and themselves. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Aaron E. Carroll.","Aaron Carroll: Jolie op-ed on elective double mastectomy was brave, raised consciousness .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Navy has pulled off what the service's ""air boss"" called ""a watershed event,"" launching a drone from an aircraft carrier. The X-47B Unmanned Combat Air System (UCAS) demonstrator completed a catapult launch from the USS George H.W. Bush off the coast of Virginia Tuesday morning. ""Today we saw a small, but significant pixel in the future picture of our Navy as we begin integration of unmanned systems into arguably the most complex warfighting environment that exists today: the flight deck of a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier,"" the ""air boss,"" Vice Adm. David Buss, commander of Naval Air Forces, said in a statement. The drone landed at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland, after a 65-minute flight around Chesapeake Bay, the Navy said. ""The flight today demonstrated that the X-47B is capable of operation from a carrier, hand-off from one mission control station to another, flight through the national airspace, and recovery at another location without degradation in safety or precision,"" Matt Funk, the lead engineer for the UCAS program, said in statement. The next milestone will be landing the craft back on the carrier as the flight deck pitches in the open sea, something onboard pilots consider one of the most difficult things they do. That may come sometime this summer, the Navy statement said. Drone came within 200 feet of airliner in March . One state has a new law restricting drone use .","The launch from the USS George H.W.

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- After weeks of large anti-government demonstrations in the capital, Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra dissolved the nation's parliament Monday and called for new elections. ""I don't want our country and the Thai people to suffer from more losses,"" Yingluck said in a televised address. ""I have decided to dissolve the house."" Her announcement came as protesters began marching toward her office, known as Government House, in the latest effort to put pressure on her administration. A day earlier, Thailand's main opposition party said its roughly 150 members would resign en masse from parliament because they could no longer work with the government. ""This government is no longer justified to run the country, as this house is no longer justified. Today we resign to express that stance,"" opposition party leader Abhisit Vejjajiva said. Dissolving parliament and calling elections appear unlikely to placate protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban, a former deputy prime minister for the Democrat Party. He has called for power to be transferred to an unelected ""people's council."" Thaksin's influence . During the weeks of demonstrations, protesters have occupied various government offices. The rallies have been mostly peaceful, but clashes between protesters and government supporters on November 30 left five people dead. Protesters and police, who had confronted each other with tear gas and rocks in parts of Bangkok last week, agreed to a truce Tuesday in a show of respect for Thailand's revered king, who celebrated his 86th birthday Thursday. Protest leaders have said they want to rid Thailand of the influence of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, the older brother of Yingluck. That's an ambitious goal in a country where parties affiliated with Thaksin, who built his political success on populist policies that appealed to Thailand's rural heartland, have won every election since 2001. Thaksin was ousted in a military coup in 2006 and has spent most of the time since then in exile overseas. If he returns, he risks a two-year prison sentence on a corruption conviction, which he says was politically motivated. The current protests in Bangkok were prompted by a botched attempt by Yingluck's government to pass an amnesty bill that would have opened the door for her brother's return. That move added fuel for critics who accuse Yingluck of being nothing more than Thaksin's puppet, an allegation she has repeatedly denied.","NEW: Yingluck says she doesn't want the country ""to suffer from more losses""

"(CNN) -- ""Dr. Youn, I want the works."" Carol, an attractive Caucasian woman in her mid-40s, sat across from me in the consultation room. Her eyes stared into mine, unwavering. ""What do you mean by 'the works?' "" I asked. ""I want to enlarge my breasts, flatten my tummy, lift my neck and skinny my thighs. Oh, and I want my eyes to tilt like Megan Fox's, and I want you to plump my lips like Angelina Jolie's."" She puckered and smacked her lips. ""Carol, that's a lot of plastic surgery. Are you sure you need all this? Why do you want to have so much done?"" She paused. Her face flushed a bright shade of crimson red. ""Because,"" she seethed, ""My husband left me for a younger woman. And I want revenge."" Revenge plastic surgery is becoming more common. A 2011 survey by the Transform Plastic Surgery Group in the United Kingdom found that over a quarter (26%) of their patients were recently divorced women, while 11% were newly single men. Suffering from 'tattoo regret' Even Hollywood is getting involved in revenge surgery. ""Real Housewives of Beverly Hills"" star Brandi Glanville recently revealed in her book, ""Drinking and Tweeting and Other Brandi Blunders,"" that she spent $12,000 to undergo rejuvenation of her private parts after breaking up with her husband Eddie Cibrian (who is now married to country singer LeAnn Rimes). She even paid for it with his credit card. In my metro Detroit plastic surgery practice, I estimate that 20% of my new female patients have recently undergone a divorce. These patients usually fit into one of three categories. The largest group is recent divorcees who are back ""on the market"" and want to enhance their appearance to be more attractive to the opposite sex. A smaller group of newly single patients have always wanted to have plastic surgery but their ex-spouses disallowed it. The divorce frees them to finally go under the knife. And then there are patients such as Carol, who seek plastic surgery as a way to make their ex-spouses jealous. For them, plastic surgery is a way to gain the ex's attention. It's a ""look-at-me-now!"" mentality. But recent divorcees may not be in the best mindset to make major medical decisions such as whether to have cosmetic surgery. In fact, according to the Holmes and Rahe stress scale, divorce ranks as one of the most stressful events that can occur during one's life, second only to the death of a spouse. Breasts, butts out in 2012; faces in . So when I see newly divorced patients in my office, I encourage them to hold off on plastic surgery until they're in a good mental state. That didn't stop Carol, though. One year later, she came back to see me. She arrived at my office dressed conservatively. Her hair was unstyled and she wore no makeup, although her neckline was sharp and her lips were decidedly plump. The corners of her eyes were slanted upwards, like a cat, and her eyebrows were overly arched, resembling Mr. Spock. A disproportionately large bosom jutted out from her chest, causing the front of her shirt to hang over her flat tummy. We sat down across from each other in the consultation room. ""Hi Carol. You look a little different."" ""Well, because you wouldn't operate on me, Dr. Youn, I went to a different doctor. He performed a face lift, brow lift, lip plumping, eyelid tilting, breast augmentation, tummy tuck and liposuction,"" she said, a serious look on her face. ""Wow, that's a lot of surgery."" ""Yeah, I know. But my husband and I are back together ,and we've even renewed our vows."" ""That's great! So what can I do for you?"" ""The thing is, though, now that we're back together, I figured out what I really want."" ""And that is?"" ""To look like my old self again."" The unsung heroes of medicine .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Justice Department on Tuesday defended its decision to subpoena phone records from Associated Press bureaus and reporters, saying the requests were limited and necessary to investigate a leak of classified information. The AP revealed Monday that federal agents had collected two months of telephone records for some of its reporters and editors without notifying it of the subpoena. In a letter to Gary Pruitt, the news service's president, Deputy Attorney General James Cole said the Justice Department had balanced the public's right to know with national security. ""Any subpoena that is issued should be drawn as narrowly as possible, be directed at relevant information regarding a limited subject matter and should cover a reasonably limited period of time,"" Cole wrote. ""We are required to negotiate with the media organization in advance of issuing the subpoenas unless doing so would pose a substantial threat to the integrity of the investigation. We take this policy, and the interests that it is intended to protect, very seriously and followed it in this matter."" Justice officials haven't specified the leak that triggered the probe, but the AP has said it believes the investigation focuses on its account of a foiled plot to bomb a U.S. airliner in May 2012. AP blasts feds for phone records search . In response to Cole, Pruitt wrote that government officials ""assured us that the national security concerns had passed"" before it ran the story. ""Indeed, the White House was preparing to publicly announce that the bomb plot had been foiled,"" Pruitt wrote. ""The White House had said there was no credible threat to the American people in May of 2012. The AP story suggested otherwise, and we felt that was important information and the public deserved to know it."" Speaking Tuesday evening to CNN's Erin Burnett, AP Executive Editor Kathleen Carroll said the news service is ""shocked"" by what unfolded. ""We've never seen anything along the size and scope of this particular investigation,"" she said. In all, federal agents collected records from more than 20 lines, including personal phones and AP phone numbers in New York; Hartford, Connecticut; and Washington, he wrote in a letter of protest to Attorney General Eric Holder. Among those staffers whose phone records were subpoenaed was the news service's Washington bureau chief, Sally Buzbee, AP spokeswoman Ellen Hale said Tuesday. Investigators sought call records from five other reporters and an editor, the AP reported Monday. Carroll said the phone lines were used by about 100 journalists, casting a ""very broad net"" of AP operations ""that have, as far as I know, no particular connection to the story that they (authorities) seem to be investigating."" Holder said Tuesday that he had stepped aside to avoid any potential conflict of interest in the case and left the decision to subpoena the phone records to Cole. He said his recusal was necessary because he had been questioned by FBI agents as part of the leak probe and wanted to make sure ""that the investigation was seen as independent."" The story the AP says is at the center of the probe broke the news that the CIA had thwarted an al Qaeda plot to blow up a U.S.-bound jetliner around the anniversary of the killing of Osama bin Laden by American commandos. Sources later told CNN that the operative who was supposed to have carried the bomb had been inserted into al Qaeda's Yemeni affiliate by Saudi intelligence, and that the device had been handed over to U.S. analysts. Holder said the leak being investigated was one of the most serious he has ever seen. ""It put the American people at risk, and that's not hyperbole,"" he said. ""It put the American people at risk, and finding who was responsible for that required very aggressive action."" It's not the first time the Justice Department has taken flak for seeking the phone records of an AP reporter. In 2002, Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley criticized the department for its subpoenas of John Solomon, an AP writer who had written about an investigation into then-Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-New Jersey. The subpoena also spurred a protest from the journalism association Investigative Reporters and Editors. The Obama administration has launched several high-profile leak probes, leading to the prosecution of two government employees accused of revealing classified information. Thomas Drake, a former National Security Agency official, was sentenced to one year of probation and 240 hours of community service in 2011, while former CIA officer John Kiriakou was sentenced to 30 months in prison after admitting to identifying a covert intelligence officer. Documentary filmmaker Robert Greenwald, whose previous movies have criticized the war in Iraq, Fox News and Walmart, called the administration's pursuit of leakers ""an effort to silence and scare whistleblowers, and to get the press to be quiet and do what it wants them to do."" ""This is a systemic, continuing problem,"" said Greenwald, whose latest film, ""War on Whistleblowers,"" focuses on the issue. ""It's not a one-off, and it's not an accident, sadly."" CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said Monday that the subpoenas were likely legal, but go further than previous administrations in pursuing private information of journalists. ""I have never heard of a subpoena this broad,"" Toobin said. The White House had no knowledge of any attempt by the Justice Department to seek the records, spokesman Jay Carney said Tuesday. ""We are not involved with the White House in any decisions made in connection with ongoing criminal investigations as those matters are handled appropriately by the Justice Department independently,"" Carney told reporters at a news conference. Carney said the administration supports the right of the press to pursue investigative journalism, but said a balance must be struck between that right and national security interests. ""The president is a strong defender of the First Amendment and a firm believer in the need for the press to be unfettered in its ability to conduct investigative reporting and to facilitate a free flow of information,"" Carney said. ""He also, of course, recognizes the need for the Justice Department to investigate alleged criminal activity without undue influence.""

"Las Vegas, Nevada (CNN) -- Disgraced football legend O.J. Simpson was in a Las Vegas courtroom Monday in a bid to get his robbery, assault and kidnapping convictions thrown out. Dressed in a blue prison uniform, the Heisman Trophy winner and former Buffalo Bills star halfback appeared to have grayed some during his four years of incarceration. He listened intently through hours of testimony, which concluded Monday evening. Simpson, who is serving a 33-year prison term, is asking for a new trial. In court papers, he's arguing that bad legal advice led to his arrest and conviction in a 2007 confrontation with sports memorabilia dealers. Simpson accuses his old lawyer, Yale Galanter, of having a conflict of interest and of failing to mount an effective defense in his trial. He also says Galanter told him before that confrontation that he was within his rights to take back property he believed had been stolen from him, ""so long as there would be no trespass and no physical force used against the persons with the property."" Among the witness called on Monday was Arnelle Simpson, one of O.J. Simpson's daughters, who said she and her father had dinner with Galanter and his wife the night before the incident took place. Simpson, 65, was convicted of leading a group of associates into a room at the Palace Station hotel and casino and using threats, guns and force to take back the items from the two dealers. ""Simpson also contends that Galanter did not advise Simpson that carrying out the plan could subject him to criminal charges, regardless of the ownership of the property,"" his new lawyers wrote in seeking a new trial. Simpson also blames Galanter for preventing him from testifying in his own defense. Without putting him on the stand, ""There was no evidence presented to adequately challenge the state's evidence of criminal intent and knowledge of the guns or the bad character evidence to which the jury was exposed,"" his appeal states. The Nevada Supreme Court already upheld his conviction in 2010. Prosecutors have called the new attempt to reverse his conviction ""without merit,"" and Galanter is quoted in court papers as telling the judge in the original trial that he spoke to Simpson only after the confrontation. ""Other than Simpson's bare allegations, the record does not support any conflict of interest,"" prosecutors wrote in response to Simpson's claims. Galanter could not be immediately reached for comment Sunday. Simpson's October 2008 conviction came on the anniversary of his famous acquittal on murder charges in the 1994 deaths of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman. Though cleared of criminal charges, a civil jury later slapped him with a $33 million wrongful-death judgment, and lawyers for the Goldman family have doggedly pursued his assets. His current sentence leaves him eligible for parole in 2017.

"Cleveland (CNN) -- Bicycles. Barbed wire. A chain. Those are of just some of the items found in kidnapping suspect Ariel Castro's Cleveland yard, according to photographs taken over the weekend by a neighbor and obtained by CNN. The neighbor asked not to be identified and said that he took the photographs because he wants people to know what's there. The images show a cluttered yard. Inside Cleveland's haunted house . A garage sits in the background, while basketball nets, a ladder and what looks to be a pile of debris rest in the foreground. One of the photographs shows a thick spool of barbed wire; another shows a chain. Bicycles, clearly meant for children, can be seen into other images. From the photographs alone, it's impossible to know whether any of the items in the yard are related to Castro's case. But at the least, they help to paint a picture of how he lived. Castro brothers: Ariel is ""a monster"" The photographs show that Castro, or someone, went to some pains to shield what was happening in the house from the outside world. The windows are boarded up, and a bright blue tarp stands at attention near the garage. The photographs also show a small mirror hung on Castro's back door. Its position would allow someone to stand there and see someone coming up the driveway. Opinion: Castro's alleged abuse, sadism all too common . Castro, 52, is charged with four counts of kidnapping and three counts of rape. He's accused of abducting Michelle Knight, now 32, in August 2002; Amanda Berry, now 27, a day before her 17th birthday in April 2003; and Gina DeJesus, now 23, in April 2004. DNA tests revealed a daughter born to Berry six years ago was fathered by Castro. According to a family friend of the DeJesus family who has visited Gina since her release, the woman seems in ""good spirits."" How the horror unfolded . She is happier now, bouncing around the house like her old self, the friend said, adding that Gina had a tough time the first couple of days. The friend said that Gina is asking for her old friends to visit. She's afraid of leaving the house for fear of being bombarded by people, the friend said. Castro remains in a Cleveland jail on $8 million bond. On Monday, CNN affiliate WKYC posted jail logs showing his activity since Thursday. Castro is on suicide prevention watch, standard procedure for high-profile inmates. He cannot interact with other inmates and does not have their privileges. Castro is checked on every 10 minutes. Mostly, the logs show him doing mundane activities -- ""resting on mat,"" ""eating chow,"" and ""making Kool-Aid."" Though some entries stand out. ""Inmate is walking around cell naked,"" read one.

"Near the Israel-Gaza border (CNN) -- Hopes were briefly raised then dashed Tuesday for an imminent calm between Israel and Hamas as diplomats fervently sought a way to stop the deadly violence. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arrived in the region, where she met for more than two hours with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. She is expected to meet later with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy, who is working to broker a cease-fire. Gaza is run by Hamas, which the United States and other countries consider a terrorist organization. Clinton offered Israel the support of the United States and expressed hope for a lasting solution as she spoke to reporters alongside Netanyahu at the prime minister's office in Jerusalem. She thanked Egypt and especially Morsy for their efforts. Hillary Clinton's farewell tour takes detour . ""President Obama asked me to come to Israel with a very clear message. America's commitment to Israel's security is rock solid and unwavering. That is why we believe it is essential to de-escalate the situation in Gaza,"" she said. ""The goal must be a durable outcome that promotes regional stability and advances the security and legitimate aspirations of Israelis and Palestinians alike."" Tuesday marked the seventh day of deadly violence that that has turned life into a nightmare for millions in Israel and Gaza. Rockets rained as the death toll continued to climb. There was a moment when it looked like the attacks might stop. A senior Hamas official told CNN a ""calming down"" would be announced at 9 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET). But that did not happen. Opinion: How this could be the last Gaza war . Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri later said that Israel had not agreed to terms that would stop the fighting. Similarly, Egypt's Morsy said the ""travesty of the Israel aggression on Gaza will end in a few hours."" But a few hours passed, and Morsy's office told CNN not to expect any announcement Tuesday night. A ""calming down"" could halt violence, but it is not the same as an official cease-fire or truce. Israel has said it wants a cease-fire agreement but has not indicated whether one could be imminent. ""Obviously, no country can tolerate a wanton attack on its civilians,"" said Netanyahu, standing beside Clinton. ""Now, if there is a possibility of achieving a long-term solution to this problem through diplomatic means, we prefer that. But if not, I'm sure you understand that Israel will have to take whatever actions necessary to defend its people."" Netanyahu accused ""terrorist enemies"" of ""doing everything in their power to maximize the number of civilian casualties."" According to the Gaza Ministry of Health, 27 people were killed Tuesday, including children, and 137 Palestinians have been killed since the latest hostilities erupted. More than 1,100 people were injured. It's not clear how many of the victims were militants. Five people have been killed in Israel, according to Israel's Soroka Hospital. More than 70 have been injured, including soldiers, Israeli officials have said. The death toll in Israel moved from three to four early Tuesday when an 18-year-old soldier was killed in a rocket attack in the town of Eshkol, officials said. It climbed from four to five, according to the hospital, when a 30-year-old Bedouin was killed. Israel said it was holding off on a ground offensive into Gaza to give diplomatic efforts time. Those efforts include talks with Clinton and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. A source familiar with discussions in Jerusalem told CNN, ""One of the Israeli demands is that there should be a period of total calm for 24 hours before committing to any agreement."" How this conflict reignited . Israeli spokesman Mark Regev told CNN, ""Diplomacy is still ongoing."" ""It's in the hands now of the Israelis,"" Osama Hamdan, Hamas spokesman in Beirut, told CNN earlier by phone. ""... I think the Egyptians are waiting for some support, promised support, from the United States in order to make an end for that. So we expect to have an outcome of this issue today as President Morsy has said."" That ""expected"" outcome didn't arrive. Speaking early Wednesday, Hamdan said he believes Hamas and Israel are close to a cease-fire agreement. ""I can say that we are close, and we are on the edge. It may happen, and it may not,"" he said. Later, Hamdan added, ""I believe there is a good chance to have a cease-fire, which can fulfill the needs of both sides."" A timeline of the Israel-Gaza conflict . Regev said Israel is not interested in a ""time out,"" allowing Hamas to regroup after Israeli strikes have done damage. ""We want a new reality"" in which Israelis don't live under rocket fire from Hamas, he said. To succeed, negotiations have to be done ""discreetly,"" he said. Hamdan said Hamas' actions have been ""a good lesson for the Israeli government. It's not good to attack the Palestinians, expecting that they will not react against the attack."" Asked whether Hamas would accept Israel's right to exist, Hamdan said the Palestinian people would not consider it without an end to occupation. Smuggling weapons to Gaza -- the long way . The onslaught of rockets fired Tuesday into Israel continued to be met by Israeli strikes on sites in Gaza. Attacks included one aimed at Jerusalem, one that caused casualties in the southern town of Beer Sheva, and one that injured five Israeli soldiers. Another rocket hit a civilian building in Rishon LeZion, part of metropolitan Tel Aviv, Israel Defense Forces spokeswoman Avital Leibovich said. Netanyahu, at a news conference with Ban, said Israel was fighting back with ""surgical operations against terrorists at a time when our own population is being bombarded by rocket attacks."" ""If we hope to make these tactics illegitimate, they should be condemned in the most forceful terms by all responsible members of the international community,"" he said. ""The moment we draw symmetry between the victims of terror and the unintended casualties that result from legitimate military action against the terrorists, the minute that false symmetry is drawn, the terrorists win."" In Israel, Iron Dome can't keep the fear away . Speaking later at a news conference with Israeli President Shimon Peres, Ban urged diplomacy and said further escalation would put the region at risk. ""The world is concerned, gravely concerned, at the rising loss of human lives. Further escalation would be dangerous and tragic for Palestinians and Israelis and would put the entire region at risk. I am here to appeal to all to halt fire and restore calm immediately,"" he said. ""Further escalation benefits no one. Now is the time for diplomacy."" Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat said Ban was among those who had to take cover when sirens sounded in Jerusalem, warning of an incoming rocket. Military officials said the rocket landed in an open area of a village. Other violence Tuesday included 11 Hamas rockets that hit the Israeli city of Beer Sheva, causing casualties. More than 30 rockets were fired into the area, but most were destroyed by Israel's Iron Dome interceptors. In Tel Aviv, a man with an ax attacked a U.S. Embassy security guard, Israeli police said. The attacker, who also had a knife, was arrested, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said. In Gaza, too young to understand but not to die . The IDF again dropped leaflets across parts of Gaza warning residents to evacuate their homes and go to central Gaza City. The leaflets told them which way to go and what part of the city to stay in once they arrived. The leaflets are part of Israel's efforts to minimize civilian casualties, Israeli officials say. As a CNN crew was getting video of families fleeing an area in Gaza, an explosion shook the windows of a school, CNN's Arwa Damon reported. The target was a vehicle around the corner, and the strike killed two people, she said. Another Israeli airstrike hit a building that houses the local offices of Agence France-Presse in Gaza City. No one from the agency was injured, according to AFP. Also in Gaza, CNN saw a group of men drag the body of a man through streets from the back of a motorcycle. The men, who carried weapons, yelled in Arabic that he was a traitor and Israeli spy. Gaza has endured a crippling economic embargo since Hamas won control of the territory from the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority after a landslide 2007 election that was followed by intra-Palestinian clashes. Many Arab and Muslim nations view Hamas as the victim of Israeli aggression. Diplomats hope to avoid a repeat of 2008-2009, when at least 1,400 people died when Israeli troops invaded Gaza after a similar spate of rocket attacks.

"(CNN) -- Even for able-bodied golfers, the U.S. Open is a stern test of stamina. And this week's venue, the Olympic Club's hilly, tree-lined Lake course, is as demanding as it gets. Casey Martin cannot walk for 18 holes, but nonetheless he will tee off in San Francisco on Thursday 14 years after he made his only other appearance at a major tournament, also at Olympic. Back then he was at the center of controversy as he sought special dispensation to use a golf cart due to a birth defect which affects the circulation in his right leg, causing him severe discomfort. ""It's not great at times. I'm able to do it, but I'm in pain when I play so I'm grateful I have a ride to my shots,"" the 40-year-old told CNN. ""I deal with pain but it's bearable. It helps me sometimes to concentrate -- I realize there's only one thing I can do and I try to block out my leg."" U.S. Open latest scores . Martin eventually won the right to use a cart, appealing to the Supreme Court after the PGA Tour fought hard to prevent what it considered a dangerous precedent contravening its rules. Legendary names such as Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer were called in to testify against him. In the end, it proved to be a storm in a teacup. Martin tied for 23rd at the 1998 U.S. Open but the Oregon-born golfer played only one full year on the PGA Tour -- in 2000 -- and finally quit the professional circuit after another season struggling on the second-tier Nationwide Tour in 2006. Since then he has been coaching the University of Oregon's golf team, but he decided to have a go at last week's U.S. Open regional qualifying event despite limited preparation. ""It just came together. I haven't been playing much golf. I've been around it with my team, I coach them, and I practice a little bit but I don't play a lot of golf,"" he said. ""Leading up to that qualifier I was at the national championship with my guys, so I hit about 20 minutes worth of golf balls that week. It was kind of a random occurrence me getting in, but I'm glad I went through the qualifier and grateful I got hot at the right time and I get an experience like this as a reward."" While his early years trying to establish a place on the circuit were difficult, Martin is now hoping to cherish his return to the spotlight. ""My life changed on Monday night when I qualified -- phone calls and demands, and a lot of well wishers. Which meant a lot, it's been a really neat experience for me,"" he said. ""I haven't had much time for myself so I'm anxious to get inside the ropes and just go play. Realistically I don't know what to expect. It's so hard to quantify because I don't play a lot of golf and I certainly haven't competed in so long. ""So what does that mean when you go to a stage like this, where there's millions of people watching on TV and the golf course is so hard? I don't know. I don't even know what my golf should be, but I am going to give it great effort, enjoy every bit of it, add 'em up and see what that means."" Martin has already had a taste of what's to come after Tuesday's practice round with his former Stanford college teammate, Tiger Woods. They played together at the 1998 U.S. Open, when Woods -- who had already won the Masters by that stage -- tied for 18th. ""Man, it's great to see him. And just so happy in life. It's good to see him in a really good place"" said Woods, who is seeking to win his 15th major title but his first since the 2008 U.S. Open at Torrey Pines. ""Unless you really know him, I don't think people have an appreciation of how much pain he's in. Just the everyday pain he lives with. He doesn't show it, doesn't talk about it, doesn't complain, he just lives with it. ""And you just look at him and he's always so happy. It's very easy to go the other way and be very bitter, because of how uncomfortable he is on a daily basis. But I think that's what makes him special. That's what makes him so different than everyone else -- he has such a strong will and such a strong spirit.""","Casey Martin will play at his first major tournament since the 1998 U.S. Open .

"(CNN) -- An Ontario family is in shock after receiving an anonymous letter -- purportedly from a neighbor -- imploring them to euthanize their autistic son or move out of the neighborhood because of the ""nuisance"" the teen poses to the community. ""That noise he makes when he is outside is DREADFUL! Its (sic) scares the hell out of my normal children!!!!!"" said the letter aimed at 13-year-old Max Begley. ""They should take whatever non retarded body parts he possesses and donate it to science.""

""Either way we are all better off."" ""Disgusting"" is the word Max's father, James Begley, said comes to mind when he thinks about the letter. ""I cannot believe that someone would think that in this day and age."" Begley said the letter was delivered to Max's grandmother's house, about 15 minutes from the Begley home in Oshawa, a town 40 miles from Toronto. ""I work and my wife has (multiple sclerosis),"" Begley said. ""So Max's grandmother helps us out a lot. He is over there three to four times a week."" Durham Regional Police said the incident is being investigated, and police have asked the Crown Attorney's Office whether the letter constitutes a crime. Crime or not, Begley is concerned. ""If someone is sick enough to not only have those thoughts, but to write those thoughts out and then to mail them"" he said, then ""they should be considered dangerous. We are all concerned."" Despite the ""one bad apple"" as Begley described the letter's author, his spirit has been buoyed by others who have rallied around Max. ""The neighbors have been wonderful"" he said. Max is going into the eighth grade this year and his dad said he is not aware exactly of what has happened, ""but he sure is getting a kick out of all of the attention."" .","Letter delivered to Ontario grandmother's house .

"(CNN) -- The United States offers millions for information leading to the capture of the world's most wanted terrorists. A Somali militant group has purportedly countered with an offer of camels for U.S. officials. Al-Shabaab has placed a bounty of 10 camels for President Barack Obama and two camels for information on Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. An audio statement posted on jihadist websites purportedly from Al-Shabaab jeered news that the United States is offering millions of dollars for information on seven key members of al-Shabaab through its Rewards for Justice program. The man on the audio claimed to be Fuad Mohamed Khalaf, considered by the State Department to be Al-Shabaab's leading fundraiser. The United States has offered $5 million for information of his whereabouts. ""Whoever brings the mujahidin information about the whereabouts of infidel Obama and the lady of Bill Clinton, the woman named Hillary Clinton, I will give a reward,"" the man said. A study by Galkayo University, which looked at the effects of drought on livestock, said the average cost of a camel in Somalia is $700. CNN can not independently verify the authenticity of the audio recording, which was purportedly made by Khalaf during a speech to followers in the southern port city of Merca. The U.S. State Department's Rewards for Justice program is offering $7 million for information on the location of Ahmed Abdi Aw-Mohamed, the founder of the Islamist group in Somalia. This year, he and al Qaeda's leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, released a joint video formally announcing a merger between the terror groups. In announcing the bounties on Mohamed and his key associates Thursday, the State Department called al-Shabaab ""a threat to the stability of East Africa and to the national security interests of the United States."" The State Department said it is also offering up to $5 million each for information leading to the location of four of Aw-Mohamed's associates, including Khalaf. In addition, it is offering up to $3 million each for two of the terror group's other leaders. Journalist Mohamed Amiin Adow contributed to this report.","The militant Al-Shabaab jeered a U.S. reward offered for seven of its key members .

"London (CNN) -- Charles Saatchi, the millionaire ex-husband of celebrity chef Nigella Lawson, said Friday he believed his ex-wife had taken drugs but had no evidence of it, as he testified at the trial of two former assistants accused of fraud. The former assistants, Italian sisters Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo, deny embezzling hundreds of thousands of pounds on company credit cards. Allegations of drug use by Lawson were made in a pre-trial hearing for the case earlier this week, when an e-mail sent by Saatchi to Lawson in October was read out by the defense. In the e-mail, Saatchi wrote that the assistants would likely ""get off"" because Lawson was using cocaine and marijuana on a daily basis and ""allowed the sisters to spend whatever they liked."" Giving evidence Friday in the west London court, Saatchi said he was ""bereft"" that the e-mail -- in which he said he ""believed"" what the sisters claimed about Lawson's drug use -- had been made public. He said he never saw his wife taking drugs during their 10-year marriage and that he had no hard evidence she had done so. But he testified that the accusation ""sounded pretty compelling to me."" The allegations emerged in June, around the time that the couple were photographed in a restaurant having an argument. In the photos, which were splashed across the front pages of national newspapers, Saatchi is seen with his hand around Lawson's throat. Saatchi accepted a police caution for assault, and the couple announced they would divorce soon afterward. The prosecution also showed Saatchi a list of the top 50 transactions made by the sisters, totaling more than $1 million, which he said he did not recognize and had not authorized. He was not able to say whether Lawson had approved them, he said. Earlier, Saatchi described the sisters' roles as housekeeping, organizing the household and helping out with any tasks needed by the family. They were first employed by Lawson and then by his company, he said. Saatchi said he was aware the two sisters were given credit cards in order to pay for household expenses. This was his ex-wife's idea, he told the court. Asked about the sisters' role when Lawson's children grew older, Saatchi said: ""I'm very fond of Francesca and Lisa (Elisabetta) and they were part of our family ... The children were fond of them, we didn't want them to go, so they stayed with us as housekeepers and for general assistance."" Designer labels . The first witness in the case, Rahul Gajjar, an accountant for Saatchi, told the court Thursday that Francesca had 64,336.97 pounds ($104,500) in expenses on her company credit card in June 2012. Among the expenses were purchases from designer labels Prada, Miu Miu, Louis Vuitton and Chloe, as well as hotel bills and plane tickets. The court heard that Francesca's average monthly expenditures were 48,000 pounds and Elisabetta's were 28,000 pounds, whereas other personal assistants to Saatchi, a well-known art collector, spent a maximum of 8,000 pounds a month. The sisters were expected to make purchases for the household on the company credit card, Gajjar said. But the prosecution says they spent large sums of money on themselves. Drug use claims . Isleworth Crown Court heard at a pretrial hearing for the sisters this week that Lawson and Saatchi had a ""culture of secrecy"" around their marriage. Representatives for Lawson declined to comment on the drug allegations then, citing the ongoing court proceedings. The defense alleged that the e-mails showed both Saatchi and Lawson had attempted a ""manipulation of the court"" and that the case should be thrown out. The judge ruled the trial would proceed. The prosecution told the court Wednesday that the two sisters spent about 685,000 pounds ($1.1 million) on company credit cards over the course of four years, according to UK media reports. Lawson, whose culinary skills and flirtatious manner have long entranced UK audiences, has also appeared as a judge on ABC show ""The Taste"" in the United States. A second season of the show is due to air in January.","Charles Saatchi says he never saw Nigella Lawson take drugs but he believes she did .

"(CNN) -- Chilean voters cast ballots in a presidential election on Sunday, but no candidate secured enough votes to declare victory. The South American country is set to hold a runoff election December 15. Socialist Michelle Bachelet, who was Chile's president from 2006 to 2010, will face off against Evelyn Matthei of the conservative Independent Democratic Union party. Chile's constitution requires a candidate to garner more than 50% of votes to win the presidential election. Bachelet had won 46.8% of votes with more than 92% of votes counted, elections officials said Sunday night. Matthei had garnered 25.1% of votes. READ MORE: Can Bachelet lead Chile to change?

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- South Korea has denounced a policy that called for a peaceful engagement with North Korea as a failure. An annual white paper published by Seoul's Ministry of Unification slammed the decade-long engagement policy, which cost South Korea $4.5 billion. The policy did not change North Korea's ""perverse"" policies, the report said Wednesday. ""Despite outward development over the past decade, inter-Korean relations have been under criticism from the public in terms of quality and process,"" the Chosun Ilbo newspaper quoted the white paper as saying. ""They have in fact become increasingly disillusioned with the North and more worried about security as the North continued its nuclear arms program."" The sinking of the South Korean warship, the Cheonan, which killed 46 sailors earlier this year, showed that the North is ""... consistently maintaining a reunification doctrine based on a strategy to turn the entire Korean Peninsula communist despite its outward policy in favor of cooperation and reconciliation."" The ministry confirmed the newspaper report. The Sunshine Policy is based on the Aesop fable of a warm sun forcing a man to divest his coat after a cold wind had failed to do so. It lasted between 1998 and 2008. It overturned decades of containment, but was reversed when the conservative Lee Myung-bak government took power in Seoul in 2008. ""This government has more focus on principle-based exchange and cooperation,"" said deputy spokeswoman Moon Jong-woo of the unification ministry. ""We want to promote peace and security through inter-Korean relations -- that is the all-time goal."" While current relations between the two Koreas have been cold since the Lee government took office, and have been icy since the naval sinking this March, there were significant tensions even at the height of ""sunshine"" -- including North Korean nuclear and missile tests, and two fatal naval clashes. The Sunshine Policy resulted, however, in the establishment of an enclave for Southern tourists in North Korea at Mount Kumgang and two inter-Korean summits. The tourist enclave has been closed since 2008 when a southern tourist was shot there by a Northern soldier. Today, the last tangible relic of ""sunshine"" is the Kaesong Industrial Zone, a factory park just inside North Korean where 110 Southern firms employ more than 40,000 North Korean workers. Some pundits say Seoul's 1998-2008 engagement policy was undermined by fractures in the Korea-US alliance. ""You had the most liberal presidents ever in Korea at the time of a very vigorously conservative American president who thought that accommodating the North Koreans was not the way to go,"" said Mike Breen, a biographer of North Korea's leader Kim Jong-il . Today Seoul's policy aims are clear, their outcome even less so. ""I would say that the current South Korean policy is based on the denuclearization and the openness of North Korea,"" said Dr Choi Jin-wook, of the Korea Institute for National Unification.

"(Health.com) -- If you ever need motivation to slide off the couch and hit the gym, just think of Dara Torres. At 45, the superstar swimmer has been training feverishly to make her sixth Olympic swim team at London's Summer Games. Her event: the 50-meter freestyle, which is one frenzied lap. The swimmer (and model, TV sports commentator, author, and mother of 6-year-old Tessa, with ex-boyfriend David Hoffman) loves a challenge, but she's had some tough ones thrown her way in the past few years. In 2009, she underwent major knee surgery for arthritis and had to take off a year to recover. Last year, her coach, Michael Lohberg, whom she adored, died at 61 from a rare blood disorder. And she has found that her body -- as insanely fit as it is -- doesn't bounce back from training as fast as it did a few years ago. So this time around, she's shaking things up and taking a more scientific approach. In her adopted hometown of Coral Springs, Florida, she's assembled a team that includes a naturopathic doctor, a cook (""because it's just me and Tessa, and she wants mac 'n' cheese every night""), a nutritionist, and a pair of therapists who stretch her for two hours post-workout. Recently, she even saw a specialist who analyzed her eye movements and prescribed exercises to improve her motion sickness. Fun and games? Actually -- surprisingly -- yes. Over a dinner of steak and Yukon gold potatoes one night in the weeks leading up to the U.S. Olympic Trials, which start in late June (if she comes in first or second, she goes to London), the funny, down-to-earth athlete talked about what she eats, how she got those killer abs, and what it's like to share the pool with a bunch of 20-year-olds. If you compete in London, you'll be the oldest female Olympic swimmer everâ€”how do you feel about that? You know what? To me, it's an honor. People say, ""You must get sick of everyone talking about your age,"" but it really doesn't bother me. Health.com: Defy your age, inside and out . So it doesn't psych you out to be competing against people half your age? Not many things psych me out! [Laughs] I just try to have fun. I mean, I definitely have aches and pains that most middle-aged people have. What's funny is that I listen to music before I swim a race and while I train. And I'm surrounded by teenagers -- everything is hip-hop for them. So I've really gotten into the hip-hop scene! I'll always have my classic rock -- the Rolling Stones, the Doors, the Who -- but I've made some other playlists with Kanye West, Rihanna, Jay-Z... How did changing your weight-training strategy in 2006 help improve your swimming? My old school of training was the heavier you lift in the weight room, the stronger you'll be in the water, but I felt like I was sinking because I had so much bulk on me. When my strength coach first came to see me, he said, ""If you're using every muscle in the pool, why shouldn't you use every muscle in the weight room?"" Now my core is involved and the stuff I do really elongates my body, and I don't feel so heavy in the water. Dara, the entire nation is obsessed with your abs. We want to know your secrets. OK, the first thing is genetics. My brother and I, our body types are exactly the same: ripped abs, big arms, skinny legs. And the second thing is my training. As far as ab sets, the most I do is maybe 30 reps, but there are always some kind of rotational movements using my core while I'm working out. And I train extremely hard, so that's why my abs are so strong -- I use my core in almost every exercise I do. Health.com: Dara Torres's moves for rock hard abs . There's so much pressure on you. How do you sleep the night before a big race? It's called Ambien. Do you really? Oh, yeah. There are a lot of athletes who will take it if they need to fall asleep before they compete -- because you're thinking about your race and you're tossing and turning. I'll take an Ambien if I'm having a really hard time going to sleep. But the next day is the Olympics -- aren't you groggy? No, I feel pretty good. It's not like I'm doing it all the time, but it definitely helps you to conk out. How do you deal with jitters in general? Any tricks? I always feel sick to my stomach before I swim. But the minute I'm on the block, everything is calm and I'm ready to go. The way I look at it is, ""I've done everything I can at this point, I should just enjoy it."" That takes the pressure off. Health.com: Stressed? 7 steps to instant calm . Let's talk about food. How much wiggle room do you have for splurges? Women are going to hate hearing this, but I just have a really good metabolism. So did my mom. I used to take advantage of that and eat whatever I wanted. It's different now. This is my last Olympics and I need to give it 100%. But I told myself that this summer -- when I'm done training for good -- I'm going to go back to drinking Coke Slurpees. Even with a fabulous metabolism, do you ever have days where you feel fat? Oh yeah. And in my cycle, absolutely. I just got it a few days ago, and I was like ""Why is my stomach so bloated? Oh, hello."" Other people may not see it, but I do. That's the other thing that's interesting -- working with a naturopathic doctor, I know that there are certain times in my cycle where my hormones are so low that if I train hard, it will take me forever to recover. So I actually have to let my nice 30-something male coach know so he doesn't train me hard during those times. You've talked about battling bulimia during the early part of your career. Any regrets about coming clean? No. I wrote about it in my book because I wanted people to know me and not just, ""I'm first place."" I had such a fear of food for so long, but I finally got over it. What's your biggest energy sapper? Probably being in the sun too much. I take my dog, Scarlett, to the beach on Sundays, and I'm in the sun every day anyway with my training. I never go outside before I'm going to swim in a meet. Health.com: 8 ways to instantly boost your energy . You're very competitive -- for you, second place is losing! But what about outside the world of swimming? Are you the type that says, ""Lady, I'm taking that parking space,"" and jams on the gas? Constantly! [Laughs] It's just in my makeup. It doesn't matter if it's in the pool or in a parking lot, I always have to be first -- it's ridiculous. I have bets with friends all the time. I just have to win. I'm hoping when I hang up my suit to dry this summer that it will go away. What's motivating you this time? Why keep proving yourself? I don't think I have to prove anything anymore. It's just the fact that I love challenges, and this is a huge one I'm taking on -- much more so than four years ago. My coach and I had spoken about taking on this challenge before he passed away, and I want to finish what we talked about. Plus, the fact that so many people come up to me and say I inspire them really gets me going. I want to still give people hope that they can do the things that they thought, maybe, they couldn't do.

"(CNN) -- For months, the rebels fighting to oust Syrian President Bashar al-Assad were considered by the global community to be unorganized. But that appears to be changing, after the leaders of various fighting units agreed to move forward in lockstep with a uniform military plan. And now France and the United Kingdom are giving help to those rebels and their unified opposition organization. Though the United States has not made any kind of statement, France's and the United Kingdom's declarations of support could mark major progress toward international intervention and, perhaps in turn, an end to the fighting that has killed more than 37,000 people since March 2011. The Assad family has controlled Syria for four decades. Rebels blame the country's current leader and his forces for killing scores of innocent people, including entire families. Al-Assad blames the violence on ""terrorists."" On Tuesday, for example, government-controlled SANA news agency reported that ""terrorists"" shelled a publishing outlet in Damascus. British Foreign Secretary William Hague told members of parliament Tuesday that the National Coalition of the Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces was the ""sole legitimate representative"" of the Syrian people, calling it a ""credible"" alternative to al-Assad. Hague said he'd still like to work through diplomatic channels to end the bloodshed in Syria, but that the United Kingdom will remain open to other options. Hague said the Syrian opposition would be asked to appoint a political representative to the United Kingdom, and Britain will also help the rebel coalition with political and humanitarian challenges. French President FranÃ§ois Hollande announced last week that it would support the new coalition and would even consider arming the opposition to hasten the end of the war. Hollande met with the newly elected leader of the coalition, Ahmed Moaz al-Khatib, in Paris Saturday. Al-Khatib is a former cleric of the historic Umayyad Mosque in Damascus and is a respected figure in Syria. At a meeting in Brussels Monday, European Commission High Representative Catherine Ashton said the body ""welcomed the agreement to create the new opposition coalition."" Ashton said she met with al-Khatib in Cairo, Egypt, last week. ""We called for a long time for the opposition to unite,"" Ashton said. ""We consider the coalition legitimate representatives of the aspirations of the Syrian people."" But she conveyed cautious optimism. ""It's important that the coalition works for full inclusiveness, human rights and democracy, engaging with all opposition groups and with civil society,"" Ashton explained. Winter is approaching and the need to help people who are displaced or do not have heat in their bombarded neighborhoods is a serious concern, she said. So far Tuesday, at least 122 people, including two children and two women, were killed across the country, according to the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria. And just as the West backed the coalition, Iran urged the opposition to talk rather than continue to fight. Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei blasted certain foreign countries for equipping ""terrorists"" in Syria and said the only way to settle the crisis is to prevent the shipment of arms to the rebels, the Iranian government-controlled FARS news agency reported. Khamenei said that the ""arrogant powers want to weaken and annihilate Syria as main ring in the chain of resistance through arming terrorists in the country,"" FARS reported. ""But they will fail in their attempt."" His remarks came after Iran hosted a meeting between the Syrian government and opposition forces in Tehran Sunday with representatives of different opposition and political groups. Addressing the participants, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi described the discussion as ""an important step"" toward peace in Syria, and said Iran strongly supports any move which can lead to the restoration of peace and stability in the Muslim country. Salehi said the meeting was intended to also revive Syria's anti-Israeli position in the region.","Britain's foreign secretary voices support for anti-Assad coalition .

"(CNN) -- Thirty Haitian migrants were dead and dozens of others were rescued after their overloaded sail freighter grounded and capsized off Staniel Cay, Bahamas, the U.S. Coast Guard said Tuesday. Photos and video released by the Coast Guard showed numerous people crammed onto the parts of the boat that still were above water, with others in the Atlantic Ocean and clinging to the sides. About 110 people were rescued, the Coast Guard said. The 40-foot boat turned over Monday night about 15 nautical miles southwest of Staniel Cay, spilling its occupants into the ocean, the Coast Guard said. The Royal Bahamas Defence Force worked with the U.S. Coast Guard to rescue the survivors. Coast Guard air crews dropped food, supplies and rafts to the boat's passengers while 13 lifting survivors from the water and the boat, the service said. As of late Tuesday morning, all of the survivors had been taken to the Bahamas for medical treatment, Coast Guard spokesman Mark Barney said.

"(CNN) -- By making public her story about how she dealt with the high risk of getting breast cancer, Angelina Jolie has done a real service for women around the world. By letting us all know about her decision to get genetic testing for susceptibility to breast cancer -- and then, when the results came back positive, to have a double mastectomy -- she has bravely helped inform women with a history of breast cancer in their families about the need to seek out testing and counseling. For a woman whose career is tied to her appearance, her willingness to talk about her decision provides support to women and their partners who may face a similar difficult choice. Five reasons we love Angelina Jolie . There are other lessons to be learned from her example. For one, reconstructive surgery is better than it was a few decades ago. For another, she chose not to have her ovaries removed, which some women do despite the resulting premature menopause and other hormonal changes. Just as important is the issue of cost. Many insurance companies do not cover the cost of genetic testing for cancer and other conditions. The cost of the breast cancer test that Jolie had is prohibitive for many women. Some insurance companies won't pay for elective preventive mastectomy. And still others balk at the cost of reconstruction -- denying payment on the grounds that it is merely cosmetic or aesthetic. Jolie's choice carries risks along with benefits . Women with breast cancer and ovarian cancer in their families should talk to their doctors about the desirability of testing. If they are found to be at risk, not all will follow Jolie's decision, since even radical double mastectomy is not a 100% guarantee against getting cancer. My preventive mastectomy: Staying alive for my kids . As the U.S. pushes forward into health reform, Jolie's story reminds us that we need to adjust our health care system from one that pays for treatment to one that also covers prevention.

"(CNN) -- A Michigan man and woman convicted of trying to extort $680,000 from ""Glee"" actor John Stamos by threatening to sell compromising photos were each sentenced to four years in prison Friday. U.S. District Judge R. Allan Edgar in Marquette said the photos never existed, according to a federal prosecutor. Scott Edward Sippola, 31, and Allison Lenore Coss, 24, could have faced up to nine years in prison for convictions of conspiracy and interstate communications to extort money. Assistant U.S. Attorney Paul Lochner said a statement from Stamos was read in court. In it, Stamos said he had been slandered and his reputation impugned. Lochner said the judge ascertained that the conspiracy wasn't just a ""foolish lark."" In a presentence filing, Sippola admitted his conduct ""was awful."" ""I sought to exploit my knowledge of the personal weaknesses of a perfect stranger for my own undeserved financial gain,"" Sippola wrote. ""The case was made by the fact that these defendants made threats to damage his [Stamos'] reputation in order to have him pay them,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Maarten Vermaat said after the July verdict in Marquette, Michigan. According to CNN affiliate WLUC, prosecutors said that Coss and Sippola told Stamos that if he didn't give them the money, they would sell embarrassing pictures of him allegedly using drugs to tabloid publications. Vermaat said the defendants sent about 40 e-mails to Stamos threatening to sell the photos. FBI agents got involved and started monitoring Stamos' e-mail account and ""eventually communicated by cellular telephone with the defendants pretending to be Mr. Stamos' business manager."" Sippola and Coss were arrested in December 2009 at an airport, a pre-arranged dropoff spot for the money. Defense attorney Sarah Henderson alleged at trial that Stamos had a fling with Coss when she was a 17-year-old vacationing on spring break in 2004. Prosecutors said Stamos met Coss during a trip to Disney World in Orlando, Florida. They developed a friendship and the two communicated by e-mail occasionally until November 2009, when the actor turned the photos matter over to the FBI. According to WLUC, Coss testified there were several photos depicting Stamos using cocaine. She claimed the actor seemed interested in buying the photos. The television actor, who also appeared in ""Full House"" and ""ER,"" testified that nothing inappropriate happened at a 2004 spring break party and, accordingly, he didn't believe compromising photos existed. Coss also filed a memorandum before sentencing, asking for a lighter sentence because she is a ""good person who acted out of character."" ""The defendant was misguided in her thinking that asking for money to prevent selling photographs was a legitimate business transaction,"" the filing states. Calls by CNN to defense attorneys Friday were not immediately returned. CNN's Phil Gast contributed to this report.","Federal judge sentences man, woman in extortion, conspiracy plot .

"(CNN) -- Shigeo Tokuda looks like your average retiree, wearing a classy gray suit and distinguished glasses. But there is nothing average about this 73-year-old when he steps in front of the camera. Shigeo Tokuda is a porn star. Shigeo Tokuda (his pseudonym) says he hopes to work until he's 80 or even older. From women in their 20's to their 70's, Tokuda romances them all (sometimes more than one at a time). Tokuda is a genuine leading man in the genre of elderly porn, starring in more than 200 adult videos. Tokuda (that's his porn name) is so successful, he is a brand. ""I retired and didn't have anything to do,"" says Tokuda, a former 9 to 5 travel agent. ""This is my second life. I don't know how long I can keep living, but I want to enjoy the rest of it."" Tokuda certainly looks like he's enjoying life, saying he's healthier now than he's been in years. So are sales of his DVD's, primarily among middle-aged and elderly buyers. ""In his generation, Tokuda is a superstar,"" says Gaichi Kono, an adult video director who has worked with Tokuda.  Watch how Shigeo Tokuda has launched a second career » . ""He encourages older people to think, I can do this because that old man can do this."" Ruby Productions produces Tokuda's movies and specializes in elderly porn videos. It's a genre they helped pioneer by accident. Ryuichi Kadowaki, president of Ruby Productions, says they started producing adult videos with people in their 30's to good sales. They creeped up to 40 year old actors and they sold even better. Kadowaki says they went up to actors in their 50's, then 60's, and now they're producing an entire line of adult videos with actors in their 70's. And their star, says Ruby, is Tokuda. ""To be honest, I don't understand why people are buying these videos,"" he says. ""I think our older customers must feel a sense of security by watching videos with an actor who is in the same generation."" Ruby says it's targeting the elderly audience and considering selling videos in retirement homes. Ruby also says it's just completed a deal to release some of Tokuda's movies in the U.S. Japan does have a higher percentage of people over the age of 65 than any country in the world. Ruby Productions says it's just meeting a demand of an aging Japanese society. Tokuda says his friends are envious, because he's in a job where he's valued, something many seniors lack. ""Seniors get depressed because they don't have anything to do. They go crazy,"" says Tokuda. Tokuda hopes to work until he's 80 or even older. Giving it his all, he says, until the end.","Former travel agent Shigeo Tokuda, 73, stars in over 200 Japanese porn videos .

"(CNN) -- Never have so many been so outraged by so little. We live in a time of instant outrage. The explosion of social media and the demands of the 24-hour news cycle let us immediately express our self-righteous anger about any incident, while the content-desperate media eagerly report -- and repackage -- our rage. Outrage has become conveniently instantaneous. In the years before social media, people who were truly outraged would have to get a piece of paper, type a letter, put it in an envelope, stamp it and drop it in a mailbox. In contrast, today you can use your thumb to type a tweet on your phone and simply click ""Tweet."" Your rage is communicated to the world. Just this week, we saw instant outrage on full display in response to Seth MacFarlane's jokes at Sunday's Oscars. Amazingly, MacFarlane offended almost every group in America in one show. He was accused of being sexist, anti-Semitic, homophobic and racist. (It has to be an Oscar record.) Did Oscar organizers possibly hire MacFarlane to trigger our instant outrage for their own benefit? After all, they knew he'd say outrageous things. Any chance they wanted the public backlash to make the show, which has seen ratings woes in recent years, more relevant? (And ratings did rise for Sunday's Oscar telecast 11% in the coveted 18-49 age group.) Make no mistake: Our outrage has value. More recently, comedian Joan Rivers found herself the subject of outrage for a joke she made this week invoking the Holocaust. The media are now filled with people debating the ""important"" question: Did Rivers go too far? (Will the media ever stop asking that tired question about comedians' jokes?!) Instant outrage, however, is not just reserved for comedians; it crops up all over the news cycle. We saw it this week over Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer's new policy banning telecommuting in the company she's been hired to revive, meaning people have to work from the office every day or quit. Twitter lit up: It's outrageous! It even happened to me last weekend when I was on CNN with anchor Don Lemon and playfully joked about Canada. Bingo! My Twitter feed was instantly filled with Canadians incensed that I had the audacity to poke fun at their beloved country. Just to be clear, I have nothing against Canada. In fact, it's my third favorite country in North America. There's so much more: Beyonce's halftime Super Bowl outfit; Hulk Hogan tweeting a photo of his daughter's legs; Kim Kardashian tweeting a photo of her diamond-encrusted gun; NBA star LeBron James wearing a T-shirt that some claim was about devil worship and/or a symbol for the illuminati. I get it. We all want to have our opinions heard. When we are mad about something, we want others to know about it. When we are offended, we want to call out the person who has offended us. I'm no different. But here's the thing: Why not also unleash our collective fury over issues more meaningful than just a comedian's joke or a celebrity's tweet? I'm not suggesting we ignore those -- because even if I did, no one would listen. But in addition to those, take a moment to express your powerful outrage over issues that might tangibly benefit your life and the lives of others. Let's get collectively angry that every nine seconds, a woman in the United States is assaulted or beaten. And let's get even angrier that three women a day in the United States are killed by domestic violence attacks. Let's get really pissed that 22% of American children are living in poverty. And please save some (actually a lot) of outrage for Congress, which has become the political equivalent of Lindsay Lohan: We only see it in media coverage doing bad things. Sure, go ahead and be outraged over Joan Rivers' and Seth MacFarlane's jokes if you must, but let's show some anger about the fact that almost 10,000 Americans died in gun violence last year and still Congress hasn't passed a universal background check to ensure that criminals and mentally ill people can't legally buy guns. So let's collectively tweet away about the issues that outrage us, be they stupid comments or Syria, comedians' jokes or the growing income inequality in America. But please don't just reserve all your outrage for celebrities. They simply aren't worthy of it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","Dean Obeidallah: We live in a cultural era of instant outrage, fed by social media, news cycle .

"(CNN) -- Paul McCartney has never dwelled in yesterday, even if he remembers it quite well. At 71, he's just released his 24th post-Beatles album, ""New,"" and is generating music at a pace that puts artists a quarter of his age to shame. And in a remarkably candid cover story by Rolling Stone contributing editor Jonah Weiner (on newsstands Friday October 25) McCartney discusses the drive that keeps him creating fresh music — as well as the memories of his Beatles bandmates that continue to shape his life today. Look back at Paul McCartney's remarkable career in photos . Perhaps most shockingly, McCartney reveals that although he's always teaming up with fresh talent — ""New"" features production by Adele collaborator Paul Epworth, Amy Winehouse producer Mark Ronson, Giles Martin (son of legendary Beatles producer George) and frequent Kings of Leon partner Ethan Johns — he also consulted with another source, someone who knows his music intimately: John Lennon. ""If I'm at a point where I go, 'I'm not sure about this,' I'll throw it across the room to John,"" McCartney tells RS. ""He'll say, 'You can't go there, man.' And I'll say, 'You're quite right. How about this?' 'Yeah, that's better.' We'll have a conversation. I don't want to lose that."" See where your favorite tracks rank on Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Beatles Songs . McCartney also reveals that his long-bitter relationship with Lennon's widow Yoko Ono has turned a corner. Describing Ono as a ""badass,"" he says he's moved on. ""I thought, 'If John loved her, there's got to be something. He's not stupid,'"" McCartney says. ""It's like, what are you going to do? Are you going to hold a grudge you never really had?"" In fact, another voice from the past — that of George Harrison — had encouraged him to forgive and forget. ""George would say to me, 'You don't want stuff like that hanging around in your life.'"" But despite his spirit of reconciliation, McCartney maintains there's one person he will never forgive: John Lennon's murderer, Mark David Chapman. ""I think I could pretty much forgive anyone else,"" he explains. ""But I don't see why I'd want to forgive him. This is a guy who did something so crazy and terminal. Why should I bless him with forgiveness?"" Paul McCartney: The 1974 Rolling Stone interview . Though he's willing to reflect on the past, McCartney remains firmly focused on the future. Part of his motivation to continue recording and playing marathon live shows comes from a fear of becoming complacent. ""I've always got the critic in my mind,"" he tells Rolling Stone. ""He keeps me on my toes — 'Don't get too blasé about it.' I don't want to become too smug, to think I'm great."" Look for the issue on stands and in the iTunes App Store this Friday, October 25th.

"(CNN) -- China's top security official has linked the deadly vehicle crash this week in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, which killed five people and is being described by Chinese authorities as a terrorist attack, to an Islamic separatist group. ""The terrorist attack in Beijing was organized and premeditated,"" said Meng Jianzhu, the secretary of the Central Politics and Law Commission of the Chinese Communist Party. ""The instigator behind the scenes is the terrorist group the East Turkestan Islamic Movement that operates in central and west Asia."" Meng was speaking Thursday in Tashkent, the capital of the central Asian country Uzbekistan. His brief comments were carried by the broadcaster Phoenix TV, which is based in Hong Kong. Chinese officials have blamed the East Turkestan Islamic Movement in the past for fomenting unrest in Xinjiang, the western Chinese region that is home to the largely Muslim Uyghur ethnic group. The Tiananmen Square crash -- which took place Monday in the politically sensitive heart of the Chinese capital underneath a giant portrait of Mao Zedong -- would be the most high-profile attack in recent years. No group has claimed responsibility for the crash so far. Five suspects arrested . The U.S. State Department listed the East Turkestan Islamic Movement as a terrorist organization in 2002 during a period of increased cooperation with China on security matters after the September 11 attacks. But details on the group's activities and capacity are scarce. Chinese authorities said this week that they worked with police in Xinjiang to arrest five suspects in the Tiananmen case. And they identified the three people inside the vehicle, which plowed through crowds of people before hitting the rail of a pedestrian bridge in front of the Forbidden City and bursting into flames, as members of the same family with Uyghur-sounding names. The vehicle killed two tourists and injured 40 other people. Authorities say its occupants died when they set light to gasoline inside the vehicle. As well as the gasoline, police say they found two knives, steel sticks and a flag ""with extremist religious content"" in the vehicle. Questions over transparency . The World Uyghur Congress, a diaspora group, has urged caution about the Chinese government's account of the Tiananmen crash. ""The Chinese government will not hesitate to concoct a version of the incident in Beijing, so as to further impose repressive measures on the Uyghur people,"" it said in a statement earlier this week, citing a lack of transparency over the investigation. State media inside China have given relatively limited coverage to the story. Images posted immediately after the incident on Weibo, China's version of Twitter, which showed black smoke and a vehicle engulfed in flames, were largely deleted. Searches combining the words ""Tiananmen,"" ""terrorism"" and ""car crash"" were also blocked. CNN broadcasts about the subject were initially blacked out inside China. Simmering tensions . Tensions have run high in Xinjiang between Uyghurs and the millions of Han Chinese people who have migrated to the large, resource-rich region over the past several decades. Uyghurs complain of discrimination and harsh treatment by security forces, despite official promises of equal rights and ethnic harmony. Activists say that a campaign is being waged to weaken the Uyghurs' religious and cultural traditions and that the education system undermines use of the Uyghur language. The simmering tensions have periodically boiled over into deadly violence, most notably in July 2009, when rioting in Urumqi, the regional capital, killed around 200 people and wounded 1,700. That unrest was followed by a heavy crackdown by Chinese security forces. Beijing exaggerates the threat from Uyghur separatist groups, Sean Roberts, an associate professor at the Elliott School for International Affairs at George Washington University, said this week. Little of the violence that has occurred inside Xinjiang should be considered terrorism, according to Roberts.

"(CNN) -- Amanda Knox's former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito took the stand in an Italian court Wednesday, defending himself at a retrial in the 2007 killing of British exchange student Meredith Kercher. ""I would like to make you understand that these charges against me are absurd,"" he said. ""There was not a basis to charge me, to put me in jail. ... I don't wish anybody on Earth to go through what I went through."" He said that evidence against him -- a knife that was a key part of the prosecution's case -- was ""an illusion."" ""I ask you ... to really look at reality,"" he implored the judges. ""For me, it's a nightmare that goes beyond imagination,"" Sollecito said of what he's been through. ""Right now, I don't have a real life."" Sollecito, 29, is not testifying in the case, which is being heard in an appeals court in Florence. But he made a spontaneous declaration, which is the right of any defendant in an Italian trial, and he is not under oath. He and Knox were convicted in 2009 of killing Kercher, 21, who was found stabbed in November 2007 in the villa that she and Knox rented in the central Italian university town of Perugia. Their convictions were overturned in 2011 for ""lack of evidence."" But Italy's Supreme Court decided last year to retry the case, saying the jury that acquitted them didn't consider all the evidence and discrepancies in testimony needed to be answered. Both Knox, 26, and Sollecito have maintained their innocence. Afraid to return . The retrial began on September 30 without either of them present in court. The presiding judge, Alessandro Nencini, read out the details of the case, including the conviction of Ivory Coast citizen Rudy Guede for his role in Kercher's murder. Knox returned to her hometown of Seattle after her acquittal and has been living there since. She says she is afraid to return to Italy, where she spent four years behind bars. Sollecito was in the Dominican Republic at the start of the retrial but returned to Italy. He and Knox made several spontaneous declarations throughout the original trial and first appeal. But only Knox testified. Knox is crippled with fear . DNA tests . The court hearing Wednesday is expected to address new DNA tests of the knife that prosecutors say was used to kill Kercher. The knife was a critical piece of evidence in the original trial. The tests involve a small portion of the knife. According to recent Italian media reports, the tests rule out the possibility that Kercher's DNA is present in the sample. That would support Knox and Sollecito's case. The results are expected to be revealed in court Wednesday. Written conclusions by forensic experts have already been filed in Florence. The Italian authorities who examined the spot on the knife are expected to present their report. They will then be questioned by all parties. Knox isn't the only person watching the retrial from afar. Citing health reasons, Kercher's relatives said in September that they had decided not to return to Italy for the retrial. The family said it would follow closely from Britain and remain in close contact with lawyers.

"(CNN) -- So Yeon Ryu was seven years old when she gave her first violin recital. She was in love with music, but at age 12 she had to make a tough decision. ""I started playing golf in elementary school. One day my golf coach took the team to a golf course and I fell in love with it. I loved walking the course and being out in nature,"" recalls Ryu, now 22. She started to notice several professional golfers, like fellow South Korean Grace Park. ""She was fashionable, powerful and beautiful,"" Ryu says. Her golf was getting so much better that her mother asked what everyone had been thinking: ""Do you want to become a violinist or a professional golfer?"" The moment of truth . ""It was one of the hardest decisions I have ever had to make. I always wanted to become violinist,"" Ryu acknowledges. By that time, she already had a role model: a girl who played on the elite U.S.-based LPGA Tour, and who, at age 20, became the first South Korean to claim a major title: Se Ri Pak. ""She is a great trailblazer for all Korean golfers. She played super great on the LPGA and because of that we could dream about playing on the world stage,"" Ryu says. ""But, this is not only her influence, we must be thankful to Grace Park, and Mi-Hyun Kim and other first generation Korean players on the LPGA."" With her mind solely on golf, Ryu informed her family about her decision to put the violin to one side, though her mother was not convinced. ""'Really? No violin?' My mom was so disappointed with my decision because everybody said I had a talent for music. I think my mom enjoyed choosing my recital dresses and having me perform on stage."" The transition . Waking up early for practice was one of the toughest things in Ryu's new life. Little by little she got used to it and during the transition she discovered that her musical background would be very helpful. As a junior golfer, she had some trouble with her swing but her shots were good enough. ""My swing tempo was consistently well and I think I got my good tempo from music,"" she says. In 2006, at age 16, Ryu represented South Korea in the Asian Games in Qatar and won gold in the individual and team events. Having impressed as an amateur, Ryu turned professional at the end of the following year and joined the KLPGA, the Korean women's tour. She won her first tournament as a KLPGA member, triumphing by four strokes at the Sports Seoul Open in April 2008. Her first winner's check brought her back to her first love -- she bought a violin for her sister, who had decided to pursue music as a career. The 2009 season would be even better for Ryu. Aged just 19, she won five times, earned over $500,000 and finished second in the Player of the Year race. But the real breakthrough came in 2011, at the most prestigious tournament in the female game: the U.S. Women's Open. After a shaky opening round that put her six strokes off the pace, Ryu shot 69 on Friday and Saturday to share the lead going into the final day. The tournament ended in a showdown between Ryu and her rival Hee Kyung Seo -- who had beaten her to the KLPGA player of the year award two years earlier. This time it was Ryu who prevailed. She forced a playoff with a birdie on the last regulation green before, after three extra holes, becoming just the fifth South Korean to win the major. A sixth, Na Yeon Choi, will defend her title at Sebonak Golf Club in Southampton, New York, this week. Ryu emulated her hero Pak -- who 13 years earlier became the first Korean to win it -- and, along with the winner's check of $585,000, it prompted her to make the next big step in her career. ""I transferred from the KLPGA to the LPGA and people started to recognize me,"" she says. ""I moved to the U.S. and I am now based in California. That was a pretty big change, relocating to another country."" A keen student . Despite moving, Ryu continued studying physical education at Yonsei University, a private institution and the oldest of her country, and graduated in February this year with a bachelor's degree in sports management.. ""I could not and would not trade my university life for anything. It was such a great time for me,"" she says. ""Sometimes I couldn't sleep during a tournament because of assignments. I had to wake up early if I wanted to practice before going to class. Physically, it was a hard job but it was worth it."" That work ethic goes some way to explaining the success of Korean women golfers and Ryu is now hoping that she can inspire new generations of young players like Pak and Kim did for her. ""I'd love to be someone's role model. I want to share my experience and heart,"" says the golfer, who finished second behind compatriot and close friend Inbee Park at this season's opening major, the Kraft-Nabisco Championship in April,. ""I would like to donate to poor people or junior golfers. I really want to support young golfers, not as an instructor but as a manager."" The best decision . Ryu's determination at age 12 has led her to become one of the best players in women's golf; she currently sits fifth in the Rolex world rankings, just behind Choi, while Park is No. 1 after also winning this month's LPGA Championship. Last weekend the two friends battled for victory at the NW Arkansas Championship event, with Park beating Ryu in a playoff to claim her fifth win this season. ""Inbee and I practice together a lot so when we are standing at the 18th hole, it feels like just a practice round,"" Ryu told reporters. ""I wasn't really nervous. Two players cannot be champion, so she deserved it."" Ryu was named 2012's LPGA Rookie of the Year, having won the 11th title of her pro career by a massive seven shots at the Jamie Farr Toldeo Classic. Her love for music is still alive, and Ryu acknowledges that it ""is too hard"" to even think of trading her accomplishments in golf for a night as concertmaster of the Berlin Philharmonic or Amsterdam's Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. Her mother, who once was not satisfied with her daughter's decision, is now ""so happy that I am a professional golfer."" And it was from her mom that she received the advice that has shaped her career: ""Enjoy your life.""","South Korean golfer So Yeon Ryu has come a long way since her days as a musician .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Actor Brandon T. Jackson was kicked off a US Airways flight Monday because he was disruptive, the airline told CNN Wednesday. The ""Tropic Thunder"" star claims that it was other passengers who were loud and that the flight attendant who reported him called him the ""n-word."" ""The disruptive behavior started with loud music being played by Mr. Jackson at his seat,"" the airline said.  ""He was asked several times to turn down the music.  Additional erratic behavior was observed, and that is when the crew made the decision to stop serving.  If the crew determines to no longer serve alcohol to a customer, then their decision is definitive at that point."" But Jackson's rep insisted the actor was not served any drinks before the incident, which he said began when Jackson walked to the back of the plane to ask for two sandwiches for himself and a seat mate. The attendant told him that other passengers had complained that he was being too loud, he said. ""The flight attendant told him to sit down and 'I don't care if you're Obama's son,' then used a derogatory  word -- seemingly in jest,"" the rep said. US Airways ""fully supports the actions of the crew in this situation,"" and the attendant ""denied any use of the n-word or racist slurs"" with Jackson, the airline said. Jackson ""was disruptive and our crew made the right decision,"" the airline said. ""This is in line with federal regulations and our policies."" The attendant's remark ""obviously upset Brandon, so he said he was going to report it to the airline,"" the rep said.  The attendant told the pilot a passenger was disruptive, and the report was relayed to officials at the Phoenix airport, where he was to catch a connecting flight to Los Angeles, he said. ""The flight attendant made it seem to Brandon that they were going to land prematurely because of him, which alarmed him (and the reason he took to Twitter immediately),"" the rep said. Jackson, who was traveling from New York to Los Angeles for an audition, tweeted to his 205,000 followers from the plane: . ""blogs please pic this up US Airways the most racist thing happen i was called the N word""I don't care if your obama son"" she said"" ""they want to escort me off the plane for her saying racial stuff i have witness"" ""i wish this racist generation just hurry up and die off... im tired of this"" ""GUYS i need you help i am not going to jail for be called racial slurs please..."" Airport police questioned Jackson after he stepped off the flight in Phoenix, his rep said. The rep said 13 other passengers confirmed Jackson's story that he was not drunk or disruptive. Afterward, Jackson tweeted again: ""I was released from question and stranded in phx they will not let me fly anymore I don't want to .. I'm taking this to CNN"" He boarded another flight to Los Angeles Tuesday morning, his rep said. Jackson's rep provided a statement from a woman he said was seated next to Jackson on the flight, whom he didn't know before boarding. ""He wasn't being rowdy at all, and definitely not intoxicated,"" Elisabeth Schwarz said. ""There was another exit row in front of us that was standing, drinking and making noise.  We were all in shock when the attendant insinuated other passengers were complaining. The other flight attendant even told us we weren't doing anything wrong."" Jackson's statement also included a conciliatory quote from the actor: ""I realize this was just one flight attendant acting inappropriately and I appreciate the support of the other passengers, US Airways staff at the Phoenix airport, and the Phoenix airport police."" CNN's Carolyn Sung contributed to this report.","US Airways ""fully supports the actions of the crew in this situation""
