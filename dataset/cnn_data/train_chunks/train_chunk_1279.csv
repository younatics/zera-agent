"Noah Kagan was employee number 30 at Facebook but was fired after only eight months in the role . A 23-year-old Mark Zuckerberg used to walk around the Facebook offices with a samurai sword pretending to threaten employees if they produced bad work, it has been claimed. The revelation, along with the claim an angry Zuckerberg threw water all over an engineer's computer, is made in former Facebook employee Noah Kagan's new ebook. Kagan was the employee famously fired eight months into his stint at Facebook just as it became a global sensation. It occurred before his stock options had vested and is estimated to have cost him $100million. In his book, according to Business Insider, Kagan claims a 23-year-old Zuckerberg would walk through the offices carrying a samurai sword, pretending to attack employees if they produced bad work. 'He’d come around and pretend to cut you, joking if you take down the site he’ll chop your head off. 'You have to remember you have a 23-year old uber nerd running one of the fastest growing sites on the web. 'As mature as he could be he also was still immature.' During another incident, Zuckerberg allegedly threw water all over an engineer's computer after his work was not up to scratch. The younger Zuckerberg's abrasive and socially awkward style of management was detailed in the 2010 movie The Social Network. However, he appears to have made amends - last year he was ranked the most popular CEO in the world. It has been claimed a 23-year-old Zuckerberg carried around a samurai sword to help motivate employees . Although Kagan missed out on a fortune when he was fired from Facebook, he has since gone on to found several other successful companies. Four years ago he created AppSumo, a daily deals website which specializes in digital goods for the apps market. Kagan, who is still running AppSumo, was the 30th employee at Facebook when he was hired by founder Zuckerberg as a product manager. Kagan went on to found AppSumo, a successful daily deals website which specializes in digital products . Even though he estimated he could have earned $100million if he had remained at the company, he has said he has no regrets. Having worked at web firms such as Mint.com and KickFlip before starting AppSumo, he says of his departure from Facebook: 'It is what it is. 'Ultimately, I appreciate where I am now and all the experiences I got from not being there.'","Former Facebook employee claims boss carried around samurai sword .

"Beloved Caretaker: Hadassah Peri earned unspeakable riches working as heiress Huguette Clark's nurse for 20 years . She may look like a typical nurse seen on the wards of any American hospital. But this is the reclusive Hadassah Peri who is set to inherit a staggering $33million from the famed New York copper heiress Huguette Clark. It is the first time the Filipino-born mother has been spotted in public since the news broke of her amazing windfall after the death of secretive Miss Clark in June at the age of 104. The heiress had not been seen in 70 years and spent her time in her sprawling apartment block on New York's Fifth Avenue. There she was tended to for 20 years by Mrs Peri after the nurse was randomly assigned to her by an agency in the 1990s. Mrs  Peri earned $131,000 per annum working for the reclusive Ms Clark, who died at the age of 104 with a $400million fortune. The 61-year-old nurse’s 2001 Bentley Arnage sedan cost  $204,000, and her Lincoln Navigator SUV was around $42,000. The mother of three lives in luxury with her husband, with a total of five properties to her name. They include a three-story brick home in . Manhattan Beach, complete with a swan-filled canal, and a $500,000 . beach house on an exclusive strip of the Jersey Shore. It is an amazing existence for the Filipno woman who emigrated to the US in 1972. But her American dream began when she landed the job with Miss Clark, whose fortune was founded on her father's Montana copper empire. Miss Clark was born in Paris in 1906, the youngest child of U.S. Senator William Andrews Clark, who was known as one of the copper kings. He was America's second richest man in the early 1900s behind John D Rockefeller. He shocked the political and financial world when he was 62 by announcing he had secretly married two years earlier and that his 23-year-old wife already had a two-year-old daughter. Miss Clark became the subject of public fascination and an investigation after a century of life as a recluse. The last photograph was taken of her more than 80 years ago. Heiress: Huguette Clark doted upon her nurse, paying her six-figure wages. In her will, she left Mrs Peri with $33.6 million of her fortune . She was married in 1928, at 22, to . William Gower, a law student and Clark family employee. The couple soon . separated, had no children, and divorced in less than two years, in the . summer of 1930. When Senator Clark died, his millions . were divided equally between his children from both his marriages. When . Huguette turned 21, she received $300million or $3.6billion in today's . money. But that money is now at the centre . of a lengthy court battle as New York lawyers examine the management of . of Miss Clark's fortune, which had dwindled to $400million by the time . of her death, by lawyer Wallace Bock, 79, and accountant Irving Kamsler, . 64. Court documents released at the . weekend revealed that amazing details of the millionairess's lifestyle . including a bottomless $43m checking account. The records show $126.3million was spent by her attorney and accountant from her accounts over 15 years. Formal: Huguette (right) is pictured as an 11-year-old with her father and sister Andree in 1917 . A total of $2.5million was paid to a famous French doll house, as the heiress filled her home with the delicate figurines. Another doll auction company received 21 payments between 1997 to 2009, totaling $729,000. A total of $380,000 in cheques was spent on November 16, 2009, written by either by Mr Bock or Mr Kamsler from Miss Clark's personal account, including written out to her doctor for $50,000, Mrs Peri and her husband, each for $60,000. Various nurses and personal assistants also got massive sums, msnbc.com reports. Mr Kamsler was not left out. He received a cheque for $60,000, and three weeks later, so did Mr Bock. In later years, a large sum of money went to cover her ailing health. Beth Israel, which housed Miss Clark for years, received $4.9million for her care between December 1997 and February 2011. Miss Clark's closet friend outside of Mrs Peri was Suzanne Pierre, the widow of her physician. Mrs Pierre would often serve as her social secretary and get regular payments of around $50,000. In all, she was paid $1.7million. Mrs Pierre was also gifted with $10million in 2000. She died only weeks before Miss Clarke. According to court documents obtained by the New York Post, Mrs Peri was given an astounding $5 million bonus in February 2009. Mrs Peri is also said . to have been able to afford another guest house in Brooklyn from . her salary where her relatives stay when they’re in town. In August 1999, she was given a single payment of $133,950 for undisclosed reasons. She also stands to inherit $33.6 million once Miss Clark’s will is cleared in court, as well as the priceless doll collection. Bounty: Mrs Hadassah bought this family home in Sheepshead bay Brooklyn for $700,000 . Though Mrs Peri would not herself . comment on the riches she obtained from working for the centenarian . heiress, her spokesman told the New York Post: ‘Miss Clark was a very . generous woman.’ According to recent salary reports, the average remuneration for a private nurse is $65,000. Miss Clark cared deeply for her nurse, and would call Mrs Peri each night to wish her sweet dreams. Generous: The money was also used to secure two places for her children at this posh Manhattan apartment complex . Gilded Age: U.S. Senator William A. Clark (centre) joins daughter Huguette at the Easter Parade in New York in 1922. He left her millions of dollars when he died . But the heiress wasn’t only fond of Mrs . Peri. She doted upon Mrs Peri’s three children and spared them the . experience of New York City dorm life by instead securing two lavish Upper East . Side condos for university. In a statement released after Miss . Clark’s death, Mrs Peri said she cared for the heiress every day for 20 . years. ‘I was her private duty nurse but also her close friend. I knew . her as a kind and generous person, with whom I shared many wonderful . moments and whom I loved very much.’ Miss Clark died at the age of 104 in May. She hadn’t been seen in public for some 70 years, and only left her sprawling 42-room Fifth Avenue apartment to go to doctor’s appointments. Her New York apartment is believed to . have a 30ft library, a 40ft drawing room and 40ft living room as well . as stunning views of Central Park. It has 42 rooms covering 15,000 square feet in total. She also owned properties in California and Connecticut, which she never visited and lay empty for nearly 60 years. Ms Clark was buried at her family's . mausoleum in Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, where the only people present . were funeral home employees. All other family members had been banned. Investigations into Ms Clark’s estate are currently underway, both by the Manhattan district attorney and the state attorney general. It is widely believed Mr Bock wrongly accepted large sums of money and gifts from Ms Clark, as well as mismanaging her fortune.","Nurse spotted for the first time since news of windfall broke .

"As the story goes, the mythical Kraken was an ancient tentacled sea monster that ate whales and devoured entire ships. In 2011 researchers found the remains of a marine lizard that had been arranged in a strange pattern by what they claimed was a giant Kraken-style octopus playing with its food. These claims were widely criticised, but now new fossils discovered by the same researchers add further weight to the theory that the Kraken not only existed, but that he used his prey's bones as art. This fossil, found in Berlin-Ichthyosaur State Park in Nevada by Professor McMenamin is believed to be part of the beak of a giant ancient octopus- or squid-type creature. This has revived claims made by McMenamin that a mythical tentacled sea monster called the Kraken may have actually existed . Both claims have been made by Professor Mark McMenamin, a . paleontologist at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts. Professor McMenamin initially found the strange arrangement of vertebrae of the ichthyosaur Shonisaurus popularis in Berlin-Ichthyosaur State Park . in Nevada. The shonisaurus was a sea reptile that lived around 200 million to 250 million years ago. His latest discoveries include the beak of what is believed to be an ancient cephalopod, as well as more bones arranged in unusual patterns and shapes. Discovery: Researcher Mark Professor McMenamin says this arrangement of lizard . bones, which were brought to this area in a pattern of a tentacle, could . prove the existence of the Kraken . The new discovery of fossils, including this shell-like fossil believed to belong to an ancient octopus-type creature, made Professor's McMenamin's 'eyes pop out of his head' because they supported his 2011 theory about the existence of the Kraken . This new arrangement of ichthyosaur . fossils, which Professor McMenamin saw from a photo taken at the University of Nevada's Museum . of Natural History, show the bones laid out in the museum exactly how they had been found in the park. Next to the remains of the ichthyosaur was a 'debris pile' of scattered bones that were no longer in their correct order within the skeleton. McMenamin told LiveScience: 'When I saw that photograph, basically my eyeballs popped out.' 'We think one plausible explanation of this is an attack on the icthyosaur by a much larger predator.' Professor McMenamin argues that the way the bones were arranged could not have occurred naturally. He reiterated his point at a meeting of geoscientists recently by saying there was 'virtually zero' chance the sea's currents could have moved them into such an arrangement. As the story goes, the mythical Kraken, illustrated here, was an ancient tentacled sea monster, which ate whales and devoured entire ships. Stories about this monster seem to date back to 12th century Norway. These tales often refer to a creature so big it was mistaken for an island . Professor McMenamin said that evidence of the Kraken, which would have been up to 30 metres long, comes from the vicious injures it inflicted on the giant marine reptile ichthyosaur, either by drowning the creature or snapping its neck. The researcher claims he can tell this by examining the placement and sucker markings on bones, which seems to prove the creatures were drowned or had their necks snapped by a Kraken-like creature. But Professor Professor McMenamin said: 'I was aware that anytime there is controversy about depth, there is probably something interesting going on.' A Kraken destroys the Edinburgh Trader in the 2006 Disney film Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, still from the film is pictured . 'It became very clear that something very odd was going on there,"" he said. 'It was a very odd configuration of bones. Professor McMenamin also noticed, because of the arrangement, that they . had been carried away from where they were killed, leading him to think . they had been carried to the Kraken's lair and dumped in the pattern of . the mysterious creature's tentacles in a 'midden' - a pile of remains . accumulated by the beast. 'Modern octopus will do this,' Professor McMenamin said. 'What if there was an ancient, very large sort of . octopus, like the Kraken of mythology?' 'I think that these things were . captured by the Kraken and taken to the midden and the cephalopod would . take them apart.' Professor McMenamin explained the absence of any Kraken fossils with the fact that octopuses are soft-bodied creatures, but sceptics say his explanation is simply circumstantial evidence. Today's cephalopods - even the largest - are rarely much bigger than a human being. The largest existing specimens of this Pacific giant octopus species tend to weigh around 150lb .","Kraken is a legendary tentacled monster that ate whales and even ships .

"It sounds like one of the complex theories he is so good at making seem simple. In fact, the ‘Cox Effect’ is the name given to the surge of interest in all things scientific when Professor Brian Cox appears on television. Amazon has reported an extraordinary leap in sales of telescopes of almost 500 per cent thanks to the popularity of BBC2’s Stargazing Live. Makes things simple: Professor Brian Cox (above) has been credited with a huge surge of interest in science thanks to the popularity of his show Stargazing Live . The show, which is fronted by Professor Cox and Dara O’Briain, explores astronomy and the sky at night. This year’s series has seen record ratings – peaking at 3.8million including those watching on HD – with audiences keener than ever to learn about the wider universe. A spokesman for Amazon.co.uk said it saw sales of telescopes jump by 491 per cent after the first show aired on Monday night. He said: ‘In the three hours following ‘Stargazing Live’ being aired, we saw an almost six-fold increase in sales of telescopes. ‘Each time the popular physicist appears on TV we see a jump in telescope sales and that would appear to point to a significant ‘Brian Cox effect’ encouraging a renewed interest in stargazing.’ Renewed interest: Sales of telescopes on Amazon have rocketed six-fold since the launch of Stargazing Live on Monday . Thousands took to Twitter to praise the star for making difficult theories more accessible. Professor Cox, who used to be in pop band D:Ream, is hailed with making science 'sexy' again. Academics and examiners have reported seeing a huge increase in students interested in maths and science subjects. In . 2011, entries for A-level maths are up by just over 40 per cent over . five years, while the number of entries for physics has risen by 19.6 . per cent and chemistry is up 19.4 per cent. Sexy again: There has also been a huge jump in the number of students taking A-Level maths, physics and chemistry . The TV physicist, who made his name presenting BBC2 series Wonders of the Universe, is credited with helping fuel the big rises. He said in a recent interview he believed there had been a ‘step change’ in the public’s opinion of science. Professor Cox said: ‘I go to schools and I see and hear there are a lot of kids, girls as well as boys, interested in science and engineering. ‘This is the message: that these subjects are great things to do – for the individual it’s great because there is a shortage of scientists and engineers, but it’s also great for the country, because our country needs these people to improve our economy in the 21st century.’","Professor Brian Cox is making science sexy again .

"Islamic State yesterday called on Muslims to murder people on the streets of Western countries which oppose its takeover of Iraq and Syria. The terror group’s spokesman, Abu Mohammed al-Adnani, urged supporters to knock people down with cars and attack them with knives, in a chilling echo of the murder of soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich last year. Fusilier Rigby’s two killers – subsequently jailed for life – told passers-by they had killed a soldier to avenge the killing of Muslims by British armed forces. Scroll down for video . Abu Mohammed al-Adnani, the terror group's spokesman, called on supporters to launch random attacks on the streets of Western countries . Fusilier Rigby’s two killers – Michael Adebolajo (left) and Michael Adebowale (right)  – told passers-by they had killed a soldier to avenge the killing of Muslims by British armed forces . In his message, Adnani demands: ‘If you can kill a disbelieving American or European, especially the spiteful and filthy French, or an Australian, or a Canadian ... including the citizens of the countries that entered into a coalition against Islamic State, then rely upon Allah, and kill him. 'Smash his head with a rock, or slaughter him with a knife, or run him over with your car, or throw him down from a high place, or choke him, or poison him. ‘Kill the disbeliever whether he is civilian or military, for they have the same ruling. Both of them are disbelievers. Both of them are considered to be waging war. Both of their blood and wealth is legal for you to destroy.’ A young Syrian claims Islamic State offered him £950 a month, a car and a house to take a job at its headquarters. It is believed the terror group is attempting to recruit ‘spin doctors’ as part of its slick propaganda machine. The man, who turned down the role in Raqqa, northern Syria, also said he was offered cameras and editing software. Investigators believe IS leaders have access to £1.4billion and ‘earn’ around £3.5million a day, largely from selling oil. At one point in the tirade, US Secretary of State John Kerry is described as an ‘uncircumcised old geezer’ – the British slang seen as evidence the translation from Arabic to English was done by an IS recruit from the UK. Meanwhile, Turkey has begun to close checkpoints with Syria after more than 130,000 refugees fleeing IS poured across the border. As Turkish troops were dispatched to the frontier last night, there were fears tens of thousands more refugees will try to enter the country in the next two days. Many are from the Syrian border town of Kobane and surrounding villages, which IS militants have targeted. Turkey opened a 19-mile section of the border at the weekend for those fleeing Kobane. More than one million Syrians have fled to Turkey since the start of the uprising against president Bashar al-Assad three years ago.","Terror group spokesman called on Muslims to murder people on streets .

"Twelve struggling towns offered help from TV guru Mary Portas to save their high streets still have fewer shops than two years ago, it emerged today. The businesswoman and presenter was hired by the government to turn around town centres in places like Bedford, Dartford and Margate, with a share of a £1.2million fund. But two years on, there are still 53 fewer shops in their dozen towns than before the project started, with Labour claiming it is 'politically embarrassing' for the government. Scroll down for video . Businesswoman and TV presenter Mary Portas was hired by the government to offer ideas to turn around struggling high streets . The plight of town centres was thrown into the spotlight in the wake of the recession, when a revival in the economy was not matched by empty stores reopening. The loss of big names like Woolworths, Zavvi, Whittard and JJB Sports from many high streets was accompanied by the rise of charity and betting shops. In 2012, Portas was appointed by the government to bring about a revival in areas worst affected by the economic downturn and the rise of out-of-town shopping centres. The first 12 Portas Pilot towns were Bedford in Bedfordshire, Croydon in Greater London, Dartford in Kent, Bedminster in Bristol, Liskeard in Cornwall, Margate in Kent, Market Rasen in Lincolnshire, Nelson in Lancashire, Newbiggin by the Sea in Northumberland, Stockport in Greater Manchester, Stockton on Tees in Teesside and Wolverhampton in the West Midlands. They were promised an injection of life, with more markets, better branding and pop-up shops. Ideas included ‘guerilla gardening’, street art, town criers and bicycle rickshaw services. However, many of her main recommendations including free parking and cheaper business rates were not taken up by ministers. After a year of the project, the total number of shops in the first 12 Portas Pilot towns had fallen by 95. New research by the Local Data Company shows things are improving, but are still not back to the level seen in 2012. In the last 12 months, there has been a net increase of 42 in the number of shops in the first pilot areas, according to research commissioned by BBC Radio 4’s You and Yours programme. This means the number of shops is still 53 lower than it was two years ago. In the first 12 Portas Pilot towns, there are still 52 fewer shops than there were two years ago. The towns are Bedford in Bedfordshire, Croydon in Greater London, Dartford in Kent, Bedminster in Bristol, Liskeard in Cornwall, Margate in Kent, Market Rasen in Lincolnshire, Nelson in Lancashire, Newbiggin by the Sea in Northumberland, Stockport in Greater Manchester, Stockton on Tees in Teesside and Wolverhampton in the West Midlands. Labour MP Adrian Bailey, chairman of the business select committee, told the BBC: ‘The response was inadequate to actually transform the fortunes of the high streets in those selected areas. ‘These are pilots. Now, you would normally expect the government when they have introduced pilot schemes to have some process for assessing how they have worked, then doing a report and then making recommendations arising from the evidence that they have got there. ‘None of that appears to have taken place. ‘So I think the inevitable conclusion you can draw is this was really a political response to the Portas recommendations and is now being exposed as not delivering and potentially politically embarrassing to the government.’ The government argues that across the country shop vacancy rates are down to their lowest level since 2010, at 13.4 per cent in June. High Streets Minister Penny Mordaunt insisted Portas Pilots and Town Teams are ‘helping to drive the local economy, boost business and adopt shopper-friendly parking policies’. She added: ‘The main aim of the scheme has always been to harness the energy and enthusiasm of the local community and give them the freedom to try out their ideas. This is a long term project, but pilots are already showing what is possible. ‘From Nelson getting empty shops back into use to Braintree developing 10p parking initiatives. ‘The Government’s long term economic plan is supporting high streets. We have provided over £1 billion of business rates support which includes the doubling of small business rate relief and a reoccupation discount of 50 per cent for businesses taking on long-term empty shops.’","Mary Portas hired by the government to turn around struggling towns .

"More than a fifth of Britain’s stores will close by 2018 as increasing numbers of customers switch  to internet shopping, experts  warn today. As a result, swathes of Britain’s high streets may have to be knocked down to make way for housing and other uses as a predicted 62,000 shops go to the wall. In particularly deprived areas, such as Wales and the North West, up to three in ten stores could close. Death of the High Street: A predicted 62,000 shops are set to close by 2018, and around 316,000 workers are expected to lose their jobs as Britain switches to online shopping . Around 316,000 workers are expected to lose their jobs in the high street Armageddon, according to a study published today by the Centre for Retail Research. The independent retail analysis group says the country needs a £320million redevelopment programme to build 20,000 homes on redundant shopping streets and convert disused outlets to doctors’ surgeries, community and leisure centres, nursery schools and offices. The centre’s founder, Professor Joshua Bamfield, said that Britons are leading the exodus from  bricks-and-mortar stores to making purchases online. Websites already take 12.7 per cent of  Britain’s retail spending. But this  is expected to surge to at least 22  per cent by 2018. Major chains such as Tesco, Wickes, Asda and B&Q are opening fewer large stores, and Marks & Spencer is to stop building big outlets in 2016. New trend: Both customers and retailers turn to online shopping and as a result, thousands of shops are set to close within the next five years . Professor Bamfield’s report, Retail Futures 2018, says the first closures will be pharmacies and health and beauty stores, followed by  those selling music, books, cards, stationery and gifts, as well as DIY outlets. He added: ‘The total number of UK retail stores will fall by 22 per cent over the next five years from 281,930 to 220,000 in 2018. ‘If no action is taken, store vacancy rates could almost double to 24 per cent. Already this year, 16 major retailers have gone into administration operating 1,985 shops and employing 14,719 staff. ‘By the end of 2018, research predicts that a further 164 companies will go bust, taking 22,600 stores and 140,000 employees with them.’ As customers go online, the cost of running a town centre store has risen far faster than increases in pay and takings. For example, a small shop on a Midlands high street costs around £10,000 a month to rent. The equivalent space in a warehouse on the outskirts of Corby, Northamptonshire, achieving the same sales online would cost up to £1,800 a month, with lower business rates and no parking charges for customers. The amount of consumer spending on the high street  is down from around 50 per cent in 2000 to an estimated 40.2 per cent today. Last year, the Government hired TV retail expert Mary Portas– the self-styled Queen of Shops – to devise an action plan to revitalise town centres. Some areas subsequently  won small rejuvenation  grants, but the resulting initiatives were dismissed as merely window dressing. Key recommendations, such as business rate controls and restrictions on the building of out-of-town supermarkets, were left on the shelf. Professor Bamfield said: ‘High streets need to combine the enthusiasm generated by Mary Portas with realistic and well-managed plans. ‘The March 2013 budget saw the Government promising to invest £130billion to help people buy property. Our proposal would actually help create new accommodation.’","A fifth of Britain's high street shops - 62,000 - are set to close by 2018 .

"Claims Apple is about to release headphones that can monitor a person's pulse have been revealed as a hoax. The source, who referred to himself as DMx, says it was part of a plan to to the anonymous social network 'for comedy'. A series of posts claimed Apple was preparing to unveil a new set of headphones that can monitor a wearer's heart rate and blood pressure. Apple's headphones could monitor the pulse of runners, and automatically track their health and performance. According to Apple's patents, the fitness monitoring system is built in a set of headphones, something users commonly wear to listen to music during workouts. By positioning the headset in or near the ear, the embedded activity sensor can pick up temperature, perspiration and heart rate data, among other metrics. In addition to skin-based readings, an accelerometer may also be incorporated into the earbud chassis to facilitate the collection of accurate movement data. However, the firm has not revealed how i will capture a user's heartrate. The earbuds are also expected to contain a tiny tracking device so they can tell the user where they are if lost. According to the anonymous poster, the headphones could even automatically alert your doctor if it detects a dangerously high reading. 'The phone stores the data in a similar way to thumbprint point data, fully encrypted and nothing identifiable. 'But nice to send to your doctor to keep track of at which point your blood pressure started rising for example.' The poster claimed to be a recent employee of the company who was recently fired. 'I have being manipulated… I'm not the only person who got sent home for good last week, he said. However, today the user revealed he had made the whole thing up. 'I made it up. 'I wrote it 5 minutes after I woke up on the 1st of may. 'I was blurry eyed, I had a headache, I was using the toilet and worrying about my blood pressure,' wrote DMx. 'The worst part is that the story just came out of Apple hiring an expert in making products that are exactly like I described. 'I’d never seen the patents that Apple filed about the Earbuds. I just made it all up.' The rumour of the new earbuds first surfaced on Secret, an anonymous gossip app popular in Silicon Valley . 'I’d been messing around with secret as an outlet for comedy. 'The anonymous nature makes it a fun place to post things you can’t on twitter.' Secret has been the platform for several accurate tech leaks in the past few weeks, including the fact Nike planned to close down its Fuelband wearables department, and that Google + chief Vic Gundotra was set to quit the search giant. MacRumors had previously revealed Apple already has patents that show the company has an interest in this type of technology. 'In one embodiment, the present invention can include headsets having one or more integrated physiological sensors,' a patent filed by Apple in 2007 says. 'The headsets can be, for example, headphones for receiving audio signals from a media device or headsets for communication with cellular telephones.' Another patent points to using earbuds to collect biometric data, including perspiration levels, and a user’s heart rate and temperature. That patent shows an EarPod device with an arm and what appears to be a sensor at the end of it. MacRumors revealed Apple already has patents that show the company has an interest in this type of technology. The app will work with a new app Apple is believed to be preparing to show off in June. Called Healthbook, the new app is expected to be unveiled at Apple's annual developer conference. It offers everything from food and sleep tracking to blood sugar level analysis - and can even tell how much water you've drunk. At tonight's event, Cook is set to unveil the next-generation of mobile software, dubbed iOS 8.  Although many of the changes are likely to incremental, the biggest addition is rumoured to be an application called Healthbook, which is believed to have leaked last month (pictured) and is designed to track and monitor fitness .","Source, who referred to himself as DMx, says it was part of a plan to to use anonymous social network 'for comedy'

The North West Ambulance Service spent the most on taxis - £9.9million since April 2008, on more than 500,000 journeys. Some trusts also provided information on the most costly taxi journeys they had paid for. These included two fares in excess of £700, one for a 184-mile journey from Cambridgeshire to Bristol when a patient was discharged from Papworth Hospital, while the second was for a 151-mile trip from Chase Farm Hospital in north London to Shrewsbury, Shropshire. Patient transport services - provided . free to those who are too ill or unable to travel to and from hospitals - . are mainly run by ambulance trusts, although private firms are used in . some places. The findings revealed a number of very expensive taxi journeys: . £700+ for a 184-mile journey from Cambridgeshire to Bristol . £700+ for a 151-mile trip from Chase Farm Hospital, in north London, to Shrewsbury, Shropshire . £670.86 for a 290-mile journey from St Cross General Hospital in Rugby to a nursing home in Falmouth, Cornwall, . £600 for a 262-mile journey from Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Greenwich, London, to Hartlepool . Other costly taxi journeys included a £670.86 fare for a 290-mile journey from St Cross General Hospital in Rugby to a nursing home in Falmouth, Cornwall, by West Midlands ambulance bosses. Another £600 was paid for a 262-mile journey from Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Greenwich to Hartlepool by London's ambulance service. The services rely on specially adapted vehicles - normally minibuses equipped with basic medical supplies such as oxygen - staffed by trained crews to ferry patients around. For those who do not need any medical assistance, official ambulance trust cars can be used to drive them. However, if neither of these options are available patients have to be ferried in private taxis. Only the South East Coast Ambulance Trust has avoided paying anything out to taxis in the past three years, while London has reduced its reliance on them to fewer than 100 journeys a year. The figures show that all other ambulance trusts use taxis on a regular basis. Sara Gorton, from Unison, said: 'There may be occasions where it is unavoidable, but while these are not patients who have dialled 999, there will be times when they will need someone with more skills and training than just how to drive. 'But our concerns about patient transport services go wider than use of taxis. There are big differences in the way that patient transport is provided and what standards are kept to in different areas.' Increasingly, services are being outsourced to private firms which means that competition is based on costs, and standards are being driven down. This also means it's harder to find out what is happening. But Delwyn Wray, the director of patient transport services at North West Ambulance Trust and vice-chairman of the National Patient Transport Service Group, said while there was concern about taxi use, it was on value-for-money grounds rather than safety. He said: 'Anyone needing medical help in any way would not go by taxis. 'I think there will always be a need for them at times, but each service needs to look at how they are using them and whether there is a more efficient and better way of transporting patients. 'That is what we are gearing up to in the North West.' The Department of Health said decisions about how to transport patients were the responsibility of local NHS chiefs. Data for Scotland was not available.",One 184-mile journey from Cambridgeshire to Bristol cost £777.45 .
"Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling has written a heartfelt letter to Cassidy Stay, who survived a gun attack that killed her parents and four siblings in Texas last month.

"Marriage is as important to the future of the nation as climate change and poverty, a senior family lawyer said yesterday. Baroness Deech said the growing numbers of families without fathers was doing more harm to the next generation than other factors such as smoking, alcohol, poor diet and lack of exercise. And she warned that a conspiracy of silence surrounded the issue because political leaders were afraid to say married families were better for children than cohabiting families or single parent families. 'Conspiracy of silence': Politicians are now too afraid to offend single parent families, says Lady Deech . Lady Deech, who is head of the Bar Standards Board, made her remarks at a conference organised by the Marriage Foundation, a pressure group led by High Court family judge Sir Paul Coleridge. She said marriage was based on a public promise and evidence showed married parents were twice as likely to stay together through a child’s early years as cohabiting parents. Children of single mothers have greater problems than those of cohabitee parents, and children of cohabitees have greater problems than those of married parents. ‘Since this is so incontrovertible, why is it so brave, as Sir Humphrey would put it, to tackle the desirability of marriage over cohabitation, both for adults and children?’ Lady Deech asked. ‘The topic has become a no-go area. ‘We live in a world where we are encouraged to take care of our own and our children’s health: we are constantly admonished to take exercise, eat healthily, wear a cycle helmet, study the side of the package, stop smoking, recycle, combat global warming, brush our teeth, control our drinking habits and have health checks. But when it comes to the one issue that does more harm to the next generation than any of these – the absence of a father in the family – there is a conspiracy of silence. Championing marriage: Baroness Ruth Deech says children of single mothers and cohabitees have greater problems than those of married parents . ‘Politicians fear to address it. It is time to place marriage issues up there along with climate change, poverty and peace as a topic pre-eminently relevant to the present and future happiness and health of all people.’ Lady Deech said those who favoured cohabitation often said marriage was ‘only a piece of paper’, adding: ‘It is clearly a very important piece of paper, nonetheless, of the utmost significance to life, equal love and happiness, say the gay community, when gay marriage is on the agenda.’ Other kinds of relationship are seen as lesser than marriage, she added. ‘Children deserve natural parents who are prepared to make the act of commitment and aspiration found only in marriage, in order to demonstrate to those children that they intend to be there for them, without question, as they grow up. ‘The wedding ceremony highlights the fact that marriage is the strongest bond ever invented to link together two people and two families, for now and posterity – intimately, legally, politically, religiously, civilly and publicly.’ Lady Deech added that same-sex couples who have entered civil partnerships are pressing to have marriage, which is seen as a ‘better alternative’.","Supporting marriage has become a 'no go area' for our politicians says Baroness Deech .
She says an absence of fathers is 'harming' the next generation of children .
Politicians are 'too afraid' of offending cohabiting partners or single parents ."
"Claims: Dr Katherine Rake leads the Family and Parenting Institute . Only one in six people in Britain think they live as part of a traditional family, according to claims by a new think-tank yesterday. Apparently, only a small minority come from ‘traditional nuclear families’ with married parents and two or more children, the Centre for the Modern Family said. Its report said the traditional family is out of date and that the Government should consider ways to support alternative family forms that are adopted by the majority. But the group’s research and findings were criticised by analysts who said that according to official statistics, six out of ten of all families with children are led by two married parents. Family researcher and author Jill Kirby said: ‘A large majority of couples are still married. ‘By painting the traditional family as a tiny minority this report is giving a false picture of life in Britain. It makes one wonder what their agenda is. ‘Their data is absurdly fixed. It is at odds with the official data on the family.’ And one of the panel of experts that drew up the report, financed by the Scottish Widows insurance group, acknowledged that the low figure thrown up by its research was connected to the way the questions were framed. The report comes at a key moment for Government policy on the family, with a gap appearing to widen between supporters of ministers such as Iain Duncan Smith who would like to see the tax and benefit system changed to support married couples, and those who believe state support for marriage should take a low priority. Traditional family? Apparently only a small minority come from 'traditional nuclear families' with married parents and two or more children (posed by models) David Cameron’s latest pledge is to extend the full title of marriage to same-sex couples who, at present, can become civil partners but do not have the right to call themselves married. The Centre for the Modern Family produced its findings from research that involved ‘in-depth interviews’ with an unspecified group of people and a phone survey of 3,000 people carried out by the Futures Company. The research was then examined by a panel that included Scottish Widows chairman Lord Leitch, a Labour donor who advised Tony Blair and retained close links with Gordon Brown’s administration, and Dr Katherine Rake, who leads the Family and Parenting Institute, a state-funded quango. The report said that ‘just 16 per cent of people define themselves as part of a 'traditional' family of two married parents living together with two or more children’. Lord Leitch said: ‘What is striking about our new research is how quickly new family structures and our attitudes towards them have changed in the past few decades. David Cameron's latest pledge is to extend the full title of marriage to same-sex couples . ‘So quickly, in fact, we suspect society has failed to keep up with the dramatic changes we are seeing in family life across the UK. ‘By society, I mean Government and public policy. But I also mean companies, charities and our public services.’ The report said: ‘The majority of people feel their family is unrepresented by politicians, the media and advertising, with 52 per cent claiming the Government does not take their family set-up into account. ‘The findings indicate family structures are becoming increasingly diverse. A quarter of all couples are childless, and one in five lives alone. As a result of this, half of the population believe society is out of date in its view of the family. ‘In addition to married mums and dads with two or more children, Britons are increasingly likely to describe single-parent, same-sex, or unmarried couples as “proper” families.’ But Professor Cary Cooper of Lancaster University, one of the centre’s panel, acknowledged that the findings on numbers of traditional families have been influenced by the research methods used. ‘The 16 per cent is connected to the way they phrased it,’ he said. ‘We did not assume that 16 per cent of people were married with kids. I would be stunned if that were the case. They are doing it on the basis of 2.4 kids.’ The latest official figures on family structure were published by the Office for National Statistics in April. They show that 60 per cent of families living with children aged 16 and under, or under 18 if still at school, are headed by married parents. If all families – defined as all couples, including same-sex couples and couples who are childless or whose children have grown up, together with single parent families – are counted, married families make up 68 per cent of the total. The figures apply to 2010 and were gathered from the ONS Labour Force Survey, which  covers 60,000 homes.","Only one in six Britons think they live in a 'traditional family', according to report .

"The pound shops, pawnbrokers and empty premises suggest a high street struggling to attract shoppers. But one sector at least is thriving – the street has 12 charity shops which have become a magnet for bargain hunters from far and wide. Orpington High Street contains branches for disability charity Scope, Marie Curie Cancer Care, the British Heart Foundation, The Children’s Trust, Age UK, Save the Children, Oxfam, pet charity PDSA and two local hospices. An 11th charity, Cancer Research UK, has two shops almost facing each other. Influx: Charity shops now dominate Orpington High Street as businesses have gone bust . Thriving: Business is doing well for charity shops in Orington, Kent, but at the expense of small independent businesses . In one stretch of the high street in Orpington, charity streets dominate the landscape . The charity shops have filled the spaces left by local business that have gone bust and vacated . Mandy Wines, manageress of both . stores, said the street in South-East London had become a well-known . destination for charity shop devotees from miles around who come in . their hundreds every day. In other ways, however, it stands as a . symbol of the sad decline of Britain’s local shopping districts. There . are few independent grocery stores or well-known clothing shops to draw . real money into the town. Some local traders say the Tesco superstore which opened at one end of the road several years ago caused several shops to close. Others say the departure of Marks . & Spencer to the nearby Nugent shopping centre contributed to the . street falling on hard times. Thrifty shoppers come fore far and wide to hunt for bargains among the mountains of goods in the charity shops . Lack of choice: Local residents complain that there is a lack of choice for them now on the high street which is now dominated by second-hand shops and pound-stores . Jacob Christodoulou, 30, owner of a . nearby barber shop, said: ‘When Marks & Spencer was here there was a . reason for shoppers to come. But now there are just charity shops and . coffee shops.’ Many of the charities have opened in . premises once occupied by the businesses that were the street’s . lifeblood. The PDSA shop used to be a Doulton China store, while Scope . occupies a former wool shop. His views were shared by Agnieszka Parker, manager of Ola’s Place sandwich shop. She said: 'The amount of charity shops . shows how bad things have got around here. There is no variety of shops . down this street anymore.' At one point in the street two shops for one charity, Cancer Research UK, are virtually on opposite each other . The council says is has introduced measures to try to encourage shoppers back into the town centre . Local businessman Warren Tull said: 'It’s all charity shops and pound shops now.' The Scope store’s manager, Jason Cuffe said the street had recently lost, among others, a pet shop and two computer stores. 'It’s been a steady decline,' he said. Plans for a new cinema complex have . raised hopes of a change in fortune, while the local council says it has . introduced other measures to encourage shoppers back, including a new . library. Councillor Peter Morgan, Executive Councillor for Renewal and Recreation at Bromley Council said the authority has carried out a number of initiatives 'focused on raising the town’s profile'. Plans for a new cinema in the area have raised hopes that fortunes for the Orpington could be about to change . 'These have included the successful . £2.2million High Street improvements, opened by the Mayor of London, . which welcomed new retail investors to the town and enhanced the public . realm and the relocation of the library to a brand new building in the . heart of the town centre, which has significantly increased footfall . figures,' he said. The council hopes a new Business . Improvement District (BID), will give businesses 'real power over the . management of their town'. He added: 'With a new seven screen .

"Barney Jones said the company has 'pulled the wool over the eyes of HMRC and the British population' A former Google executive turned whistleblower says he has 100,000 emails that expose the 'immoral' tax avoidance scheme used by his former employer. Barney Jones, who worked for Google from 2002 until 2006, said the company has 'pulled the wool over the eyes of HMRC and the British population'. He claims Google has a system in place which diverts British profits through Ireland to the Bermuda tax haven and accused the company of 'cheating' the British taxpayer. The internet giant has been under increasing pressure about allegations of tax avoidance. Prime Minister David Cameron will lead efforts at next month's G8 . summit of world leaders to find ways of preventing multinational firms . from exploiting tax loopholes. He is due to meet Google's executive chairman Eric Schmidt tomorrow at the quarterly meeting of the prime minister's Business Advisory Group. Last . week, Matt Brittin, a vice-president of Google, was aggressively . questioned by MPs, who accused the company of 'doing evil' by using . 'devious, calculated and unethical' tricks to minimise its liabilities. It paid just £7.3million in corporation tax last year despite having a UK turnover of £3billion. Yet, . Google assert that all its sales are made in low-tax Ireland, rather . than the UK, where corporation tax is just 12.5 per cent compared to 23 . per cent in Britain. Mr . Jones's earlier testimony to the PAC gave MPs such as chair Margaret . Hodge further ammunition for the questioning of Mr Brittin last week. Scroll down for video . Whistleblower Barney Jones's evidence about Google's tax affairs led to combative questioning of company vice president Matt Brittin, pictured, who was interrogated by the Public Accounts Committee . Whistleblower Barney Jones said Google has 'pulled the wool over the eyes of HMRC' about profits made through its UK Headquarters (pictured) He told MPs at a previous meeting in November: 'No one in the UK is selling'. He again told the public accounts committee that no one in the UK 'closed' a deal and that this was done by Dublin staff. Yet Mr Jones said this was a 'smokescreen'. Mr Jones told The Sunday Times that he won contracts with major companies to buy advertising space in the UK but the deals were 'closed' by staff in Ireland. He . told The Sunday Times: 'It uses a concocted scheme to avoid tax. It's a . smokescreen to distort where the substance of its economic activity is . really taking place.' He said he was at meetings where London staff did deals with companies such as eBay and Lloyds TSB. During the two-hour interrogation of Mr Brittin by MPs last week, he eventually admitted that 'a lot of the aspects of selling' do take place in the UK. He told MPs: 'Literally 99 per cent of our UK customers spend their money without ever talking to anyone in Google UK.’ But the remaining 1 per cent are the group’s largest customers, and account for more than two thirds of its total sales. Mr . Jones's testimony will add to the mounting pressure on the Silicon . Valley company, which has an informal motto of 'Don't do evil'. The company is reportedly spending up to £1million on a lavish weekend for its staff at the so-called Zeitgeist Conference. The company has hired out the Grove Hotel in Hertfordshire, where singer Jessie J will perform. Meanwhile, . Labour leader Ed Milliband will write new rules to tackle corporate tax . dodgers if he wins the next election, even if there is no international . consensus for action. Public Accounts Committee chair Margaret Hodge Matt Brittin that his company 'does evil' In a statement, Google's director of external relations Peter Barron said: 'As we said in front of the Public Accounts Committee, it is difficult to respond fully to documents we have no seen. 'These questions relate to Google's business in the UK going back a decade of more. 'None of the allegations put to us change the fact that Google pays the corporate tax due on its UK activities and complies fully with UK law.' Mr Schmidt, who will visit Downing Street tomorrow, claimed his company 'has always aspired to do the right thing' but said 'international tax law could almost certainly benefit from reform'. The Tories said David Cameron is prioritising tax law at the G8. A Conservative Party spokesman said: 'David Cameron is putting tackling international tax avoidance and . evasion firmly at the centre of his agenda for Britain's Presidency of . the G8 this year.' The Prime Minister has established links . with Google. His former director of strategy was Steve Hilton, whose . wife Rachel Whetstone is high up in the internet giant. Cameron, pictured with his ex-political guru Steve Hilton, whose wife Rachel Whetstone is high up in Google . Amazon could be hauled before the Public Accounts Committee just like Google, MPs have suggested after serious doubts were raised about how much tax it pays in this country. The company said it paid just £2.44million in corporation tax on UK sales of £320million last year. But the Seattle-based group told its investors that it actually made 13 times this amount, claiming the UK sales were actually more than £4billion. Accounts committee chair Margaret Hodge has previously said they were planning to investigate government contractors. Accounts show that nine of the largest government IT suppliers made £62billion in sales in the UK over the past five years – but paid just £527million to the Exchequer in corporation tax over that period. Five of the firms, with combined  taxpayer contracts worth £500million, paid nothing at all in the last year. The likes of Microsoft, IBM and Dell could now be probed by the influential Public Accounts Committee, which last year explored the tax affairs of Google, Starbucks and Amazon. Starbucks was one of the first companies to be accused of tax avoidance when the row erupted last year. It has since agreed to pay £20million in tax voluntarily after a public boycott over revelations it had paid no corporation tax since 2009.","Barney Jones said Google diverts British profits through Ireland to Bermuda .

"Talented musician Jesse Jones never finished his last email. The poignant message, found by police days before the 24-year-old’s body was discovered at the foot of a cliff in Swanage, Dorset, is testament to his belief that a drug used to treat acne had blighted his life. ‘Dear Mum and Dad, Roaccutane seems to have changed the way my mind and body works in a big way. I can barely bring myself to type its name because I hate it so much.’ Eloquently cataloguing the physical and mental symptoms  he suffered, Jesse’s despair is highlighted when he reveals: ‘Anything to do with the opposite sex isn’t psychologically appealing. I used to have to try and stop myself from thinking about girls all of the time; now, I could hardly care less.’ Jesse had been out with friends in Swanage when he went missing. CCTV footage shows him in the town centre, but what happened after that is unclear. His body was found five days later on February 25, 2011. Happier times: Jesse Jones with his sister Laura in Venice in 2006, five years before he died. The talented musician was taking Roaccutane for his acne but said it changed the way his 'mind and body' worked . Bereft: Patsy and Derek Jones blame the drug for their son's death and have launched a campaign to try to get it banned . Although he had downloaded a suicide manual, the coroner returned an open verdict. His email, which was saved in the drafts section of his account, left his parents Derek and Patsy, both 59, racked with guilt. They had no idea Jesse, who was living at home after graduating from university, was taking Roaccutane, which has been hailed as a ‘wonder cure’ for acne. Critics of the powerful drug claim doctors ignore its possible side effects, which have been linked to debilitating depression, bowel disease, impotence – and even suicide. Roaccutane’s manufacturer, the Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche, is facing thousands of lawsuits in the US. ‘We will forever ask ourselves, “Could we have done something?” ’ admits Derek, a freelance documentary maker. ‘We were devastated when we read his email – we had no idea. ‘He’d been moody for more than a year before he died and at times it was like walking on egg shells, but we put that down to the fact he hadn’t found a direction in life. ‘Ironically, the week he died he seemed so happy. He was starting a new job at Elstree Studios as a runner and was moving to London. Everything seemed on the up.’ Derek warns: ‘This drug could drive your child to suicide and that risk is too high a price to pay for clear skin.’ Harmful? Roaccutane has been linked to devastating side effects but manufacturers Roche say there is 'no causal link' between the drug and depression or suicidal thoughts . Jesse suffered from cystic acne and, after antibiotics and lotions failed to alleviate the condition, was referred to a dermatologist at the age of 18. He was prescribed a six-month course of Roaccutane and the spots cleared up. However, his acne returned four years later in 2009, and once again he was prescribed the drug. Acne is caused by the excessive production of sebum, the natural oil that blocks the sebaceous glands in the skin. Roaccutane capsules contain isotretinoin, which reduces the skin’s natural oil production. Developed as a chemotherapy drug, it has proved effective in clearing up acne, however a quick internet search reveals concerns about Roaccutane. In April 2010, 18-year-old Melissa Martin-Hughes, from Cheltenham, hanged herself after spiralling into depression. She had been taking Roaccutane. Two-and-a-half years earlier, Angela Lee, 28, stepped in front of a train in Ilford, East London, having left a suicide note claiming Roaccutane had made her feel physically aged. And as far back as 1997, Seamus Todd, son of the late screen star Richard Todd, killed himself after taking the drug. Derek and Patsy Jones were aware that their son was on anti-acne medication, but they did not realise the specific drug he was taking – or the side effects it had been linked to. ‘We didn’t know Jesse was taking . Roaccutane either time it was prescribed,’ says Derek, who has made a . documentary for BBC3 as part of his campaign to get the drug banned in . the UK. ‘He was an adult . and because it was recommended by an expert, we didn’t think to question . it. It worked the first time and there didn’t appear to be any ill . effects. Blighted: Actor Richard Todd with wife Virginia and sons Andrew and Seamus, left, who killed himself after taking Roaccutane . Suicide: Seumas Todd, son of actor Richard Todd, killed himself after taking the drug . ‘But Jesse stopped the second course after three months. He was getting joint pains in his fingers and was finding it very difficult to play the guitar and the drums, which were the loves of his life.’ It wasn’t until reading Jesse’s email that Derek had any idea of the extent of the side effects his son had been suffering. ‘What became clear to us after Jesse died was that he continued to suffer these symptoms even though he’d been off the drug for more than a year,’ he says. ‘In my research since, I’ve discovered that people are still having adverse effects years after coming off it.’ In February 2010, Roche was forced to pay more than $25 million (£16 million) to a man who developed inflammatory bowel disease years after he had taken Roaccutane, which was marketed as Accutane in the US. An estimated 5,000 personal injury lawsuits have been filed against the company. They claim Roche failed to adequately warn patients of the risk of bowel problems associated with the drug. Roche holds the NHS contract to supply the medication in the UK. Data collected by the World Health Organisation indicates Roaccutane has been implicated in 720 reports of psychiatric problems, including more than 100 suicides and suicide attempts. But Derek believes this is just the tip of the iceberg. ‘I’ve discovered that while many people are suffering side effects, GPs aren’t listening,’ he says. ‘There is a yellow-card system in place in the UK, which means that if you have adverse effects from a drug you can report it to your GP, who in turn should inform the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. The drug company then has to investigate. ‘But all too often, doctors don’t do it because they don’t want to bother with the paperwork. There is the option to do it yourself online, but many people don’t even know the system exists. ‘Many people I have spoken to since Jesse’s death make it clear, as does Jesse’s own email, they’ve tried to bring their symptoms to the attention of their GPs, but they’ve been ignored.’ Roche says there is no evidence of a causal link between Roaccutane and depression or suicidal thoughts, even though in the company’s patient literature they are listed as possible side effects of the drug. Bereaved: The son of Richard Todd, pictured at the Imperial war museum, killed himself after taking the drug . Derek wants Roche to print the warning on its packaging. ‘One expert I spoke to, who prescribes Roaccutane, believes that the number of people it is likely to affect is very small, but that is like playing Russian roulette with  people’s lives,’ he says. ‘These side effects can be not just devastating, but deadly. As far as I’m concerned, one suicide is one suicide too many. ‘As a director, I am used to making programmes about people’s tragedies. I never thought I’d be making one about my own. ‘If it hadn’t been for our daughter Laura, who’s 22, I don’t know how my wife and I would have carried on. Our future with Jesse and the children he might have had has been taken away. ‘A whole part of our lives has gone, and for what? ‘I will do everything I can to get this drug banned. This BBC film is just the first step in a campaign  I plan to take as far as I can. ‘Jesse’s death cannot have been for nothing. Some good has to come out of it.’ In a statement, Roche said: ‘There is no evidence of a causal link between Roaccutane and depression or suicidal thoughts. However, as there have been rare reports of people getting depressed while taking Roaccutane, we provide a warning in our patient information leaflet and urge those taking the drug to tell their dermatologist immediately if they experience any mood swings or any other side effect. ‘In the half a million courses of Roacctuane prescribed globally between September 2010 and September 2011, we were unfortunately notified of nine suicides worldwide while taking the treatment. This works out to just under two per 100,000. ‘However, the rate of suicide seems to be higher in young people who are not taking the drug. The Samaritans estimate the suicide rate among young men aged 16 to 24 in the UK to be 16 per 100,000 – eight times higher than among those taking Roaccutane.’","Musician Jesse Jones, 24, said he 'hated' the acne drug in last email sent to parents .

"The US Navy today christened the USS Gerald Ford, costliest and most deadly aircraft carrier ever built. The $13billion warship is the first in the Navy's newest generation of aircraft carriers. It was launched in a grand ceremony Saturday from the Newport News, VA., naval yard. The Ford is expected to stay commissioned for five decades and will enter the fleet in 2016. Scroll down for video . I christen thee, the USS Gerald Ford: Susan Ford Bales, daughter of former President Gerald R. Ford, right, christens the USS Gerald R. Ford . Hooyah!: The USS Gerald Ford has been christened and is ready to move out . The giant 1,106-foot USS Gerald R. Ford is be able to launch 220 airstrikes per day from its two runways, hold 4,000 sailors . and marines while appearing virtually invisible to enemy radar. 'She is truly a technological marvel,' Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Jonathan Greenert said at the ceremony 'She will carry unmanned aircraft, joint strike fighters, and she will deploy lasers.' The staggering number of airstrikes, about one every six minutes, is capable because the ship's deck uses electromagnetic force to propel the jets forward, according to WTKR. Pressurized steam is used in older ships. Electromagnetic force is used to propel roller coasters, the station noted. The gear used to snag jets as they land will be software controlled, a significant bump from the systems currently used. Pomp and circumstance: It's not everyday the most expensive aircraft carrier ever built is launched . All hands on deck: An honor guard of boy scouts from the local area and Michigan welcome visitors for the christening of the USS Gerald R. Ford . Soon to be set free: The $13billion ship will soon set sail . President Ford's daughter Susan Bales Ford spoke shortly before smashing a champagne bottle on the ship's bow. 'Dad, their message fills this shipyard,' she said. 'You kept your promise. You healed the nation. You gave the American people a president that was a shining beacon of integrity at the helm.' 'And as demonstrated by Capt. (John) Meier and by the crew and by this mighty carrier, the American people are forever grateful to you. And Dad, I'll always be proud,' she added. Other speakers honoring Mr Ford included former Vice President Dick Cheney and former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. The Ford - with a new nuclear power plant, electromagnetic catapults and an enhanced 5-acre flight deck - will leave dry dock and head to a pier at Newport News Shipbuilding next week. The Navy says construction on the ship is about 70 percent complete and will finish up in 2015. It will then undergo a series of sea trials before it is commissioned and becomes operational. The Navy also plans to buy another three such carriers, at a cost of $43 billion, to complete its fleet. But the project to build the most advanced aircraft carrier every made has come at a high price, with costs overrunning to the tune of nearly $3billion and major delays. Beci . Brenton, spokesman for Huntington Ingalls Industries, the maker of the . ship, told FoxNews.com: 'The structure has been rearranged to . accommodate new technology and meet all of the Navy’s operational . requirements. From head to toe: The USS Gerald Ford is decked out in patriotic colors . Big day: A massive crowd is on-hand to help dedicate the equally gigantic ship . Finishing touches: Workers tend to a few last minute details before the ceremony begins . The $13billion USS Gerald R. Ford will be one of the most fearsome weapons in the Pentagon's arsenal . Superpower: The new generation of aircraft carriers incorporates a host of top secret technology which is designed to secure dominance of any battlefield . Deadly: USS Gerald R. Ford will hold 4,000 sailors and marines and is designed to be virtually invisible to enemy radar . The . ship’s structure and exterior are now 100 per cent complete, Brenton . said. But internal connections and features inside the ship are still . being added. The ship began construction in Newport News, Virginia, in 2007, but is unlikely to enter sea trials until 2016. The carrier would be fully capable by February 2019, according to a critical watchdog report. Delays . ranging from between two and a half and four and a half years in . testing three of the ship’s most important new advances: its dual band . radar, arresting gear and the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System . that will catapult jets off the carrier have become serious issues. Power: The USS Gerald R. Ford is the new generation of aircraft carriers capable of launching 220 airstrikes a day . Rising costs: The USS Gerald R. Ford is expected to cost taxpayers more than £13billion when it is finally completed . New generation: The giant 1,106-foot ship is currently under construction at a dry dock in Newport News, Virginia, but will not be commissioned until 2016 . And . the spiralling costs come at a time when the Navy is seaching for ways . to plug a $14 billion cut in the upcoming fiscal year as a result of the . automatic federal budget cuts known as sequestration. The state-of-the-art carrier has provoked strong criticism from some quarters, including the government's own watchdogs. In . a report earlier this month the Government Accountability Office wrote: . 'Key ship systems face reliability shortfalls that the Navy does not . expect to resolve until many years after [Ford] commissioning, which . will limit the ship’s mission effectiveness during initial deployments . and likely increase costs to the government.' It added: 'The Navy faces technical, design, and construction challenges to . completing Gerald R. Ford that have led to significant cost increases.' National . security experts at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, . the Brookings Institution, have also called into question the value of the aircraft in future conflicts. 'I’m not persuaded they’re worth twice what the old carriers cost,' Michael O’Hanlon, of Brookings, told FoxNews.com.

"Ukip have increased the pressure on George Osborne to ease the tax burden on millions of middle-class Britons . Ukip will today  pile pressure on George Osborne to ease the tax burden on millions who have been sucked into the higher 40p rate of income tax. The Eurosceptic party is proposing a new 35p rate to be levied on earnings between £42,000 and £55,000, arguing many middle-class families on such incomes are being unfairly squeezed. It will also float the idea of a ‘turnover tax’ – a minimum percentage of companies’ annual turnover that has to be paid to the Treasury – to crack down on large-scale tax avoidance. Ukip says the £2.5 billion a year cost of a new 35p income tax rate should also be met by cutting the foreign aid budget, ending contributions to Brussels by exiting the EU, slashing funding to Scotland and scrapping the new high speed rail line HS2. It will also back a Liberal Democrat policy to increase the starting rate for income tax further to £12,500, bringing it broadly in line with the minimum wage. Chancellor George Osborne has targeted support at more than 20 million basic rate taxpayers, despite calls from the Tory Right for him to do more for middle class families who have been dragged into the 40p rate. A dramatic and expensive increase in the personal allowance from £6,475 to £10,500 means that since 2010 almost three million people have been lifted out of paying income tax. For the average taxpayer, it will amount to paying over £700 a year less in income tax compared to when the Coalition took power. The Treasury says anyone earning up to around £120,000 has seen at least some overall benefit from the higher starting rate of tax. However, the numbers dragged into paying the higher 40p income tax is expected to rise from three million in 2010 to 4.9million by the time of next year’s election. In 1978, only three per cent of taxpayers paid tax at the higher rate. By next year it will be approaching 20 per cent. Normally, the 40 per cent higher-tax threshold rises in line with inflation to take into account rises in the cost of living. But from April 2014, the point at which higher rate tax is paid is to rise by a flat 1 per cent for two years instead. This lower rise in the threshold means more workers will be caught in the 40 per cent net. Nigel Farage's party will announce it wants to cut income tax for middle-earning families at its conference . Ukip economics spokesman Patrick O’Flynn, who will propose a new 35p rate at his party’s annual conference today said: ‘This is a massive blind spot for the coalition, and for George Osborne in particular. He has given the very highest earners a tax cut, and we agree that 50p was too high as a top rate. ‘But he seems to think that tax discincentives only really apply to the very wealthiest. It’s incredible that a Tory Chancellor after half a decade in office is going to go into an election with a 40p threshold that’s actually lower than the one he inherited from a Labour Chancellor. Those on these incomes are aspirational people, many of whom started with very little. They are by no means rich. Traditionally they might have thought the Tory party would back them, certainly in the days of Thatcher. ‘Yet they have seen Osborne penalise them.’ Official figures, from HM Revenue and Customs, show there were just three million higher rate taxpayers when the coalition came to power in May 2010. An analysis by the Taxpayers’ Alliance shows the starting salary for higher rate tax would currently be £63,777 if it had been uprated each year in line with earnings. Conservative MP Dominic Raab has led calls for the Treasury to act to help those on the higher rate. He said the Government needed to ‘ease the squeeze on the middle classes’. Mr O’Flynn said Ukip would also ask the Treasury to examine the feasibility of a ‘turnover tax’ to reduce large scale tax avoidance, and at what level it might be set. ‘It would act as a backstop for the tax system, so that every major company would be measured on whether it had paid a set proportion of turnover in corporation or other taxes,’ he said.","Ukip arguing many middle-class families are being unfairly squeezed .

"A California woman has told how a three-foot-long piece of metal from an airplane fell from the sky and almost crashed down ontop of her while cycling through Huntington Beach last Thursday - the same day a JetBlue airplane was forced to make an emergency landing after one of its engines malfunctioned. JetBlue Flight 1416 - carrying 142 passengers and five crew members - had taken off from Long Beach - just 15 miles north-west of where the plane part fell - headed for Austin, Texas, when one of its engines exploded not long after takeoff, filling the cabin with smoke. Cindy Gilbert said she was riding her bike along the Pacific Coast Highway in Huntington Beach when the metal part  - known as a c-duct - landed just a few feet away from her. 'It literally fell from the sky,' Mrs Gilbert told CNN. Scroll down for video . Eeek: Cindy Gilbert was riding through Huntington Beach last Thursday when this piece of metal - purportedly from JetBlue flight 1416 - fell from the sky just feet from where she was riding. Dangerous: Mrs Gilbert said the metal part - about three-foot-long - 'literally fell from the sky' Frightened: Cindy Gilbert collected the piece and brought it home, where she called the Federal Aviation Administration . Under unvestigation: A FAA official (center)collects the plane part from the home of Cindy Gilbert . 'No comment': JetBlue are yet to saying anything about the plane part, which they say is under investigation . Flightpath: The plane left Long Beach last Thursday heading for Austin, Texas, but turned around not long after takeoff. The piece of the plane fell down in Huntington Beach, about 15 miles southeast of the airport . Mrs Gilbert carried the part home in her bicycle and called the Federal Aviation Administration. A FAA official then came to her Fountain Valley to collect the part. The officer reportedly told Mrs Gilbert the part was indeed from JetBlue flight 1416, CNN reported. JetBlue have refused to comment on the incident, which they say remains under investigation. Four people were injured as part of the engine incident. A video filmed by a passenger wearing an oxygen mask shows the dramatic scene inside the aircraft. Passengers are seen expressing confusion as they are shrouded in a haze of smoke and a wailing child is heard in the background, but everyone remains calm as they prepare for the emergency landing.

Passengers express confusion as they are shrouded in a haze of smoke and a wailing child is heard in the background, but everyone remains calm as they prepare for an emergency landing . Remain calm:  The man who filmed the dramatic scene turns the camera on himself before giving a wave . Amidst the confusion, a passenger asks, ‘Did we blow an engine?’, as the man films the cabin’s interior and the scenery outside. At one point, he turns the camera on himself, showing his oxygen mask, and gives a wave. Moments later, the pilot announces that plane has suffered a right engine failure and the engine has been ‘shut down’. He tells passengers to remain in their seats while the aircraft returns to Long Beach Airport in suburban Los Angeles. An air steward tells them to stay out of the bathrooms and keep seatbelts fastened. The twin-engine Airbus A320 was carrying 142 passengers and five crew . The pilot informed passengers that the right engine had failed and the plane was returning to Long Beach . Twilight actor Jackson Rathbone, one of the passengers on board, documented the harrowing ordeal in a series of tweets and photos. He wrote that the engine ‘exploded’ before smoke clouded the plane and revealed his relief at having landed safely. Mr Rathbone, who played Jasper Hale in the wildly popular vampire franchise, told his Twitter followers that he said a prayer and held his wife and young son in his arms. The actor posted a picture to whosay.com showing passengers coming off the plane with the help of the Long Beach Fire Department. He wrote: 'From the bus, we all just followed one after another. I never felt so okay being a lemming.' He then posted a selfie, adding: 'Where are we going/ don't care we're alive- face.'

"In 1995, the Hubble Space Telescope's 'Pillars of Creation' image of the Eagle Nebula became one of the most iconic images of the 20th century. Now, two of European Space Agency's orbiting observatories have captured a new - and very different - view of the nebula. The pillars are invisible in the ESA's image, which uses far-infrared light and X-rays to create a composite image that 'sees through' the clouds of dust that form the pillars in Hubble's famous image. The shot shows how young, hot stars 'sculpt' the ultra-cool matter around them, forming new stars. The ESA Herschel Space Observatory's new image shows the pillars and the wide field of gas and dust around them. Captured in far-infrared wavelengths, the image allows astronomers to see inside the pillars and structures in the region . It has become one of the most famous images of modern times. This image, taken with the Hubble Space Telescope in 1995, shows pillars of molecular hydrogen gas and dust. The giant pillars are light years in length and are so dense that interior gas contracts gravitationally to form stars . Hubble's visible-light image of the nebula (top right) is one of the most iconic astrophotographs ever captured by the space telescope. But other views also offer an insight . The Eagle Nebula is 6500 light-years away in the constellation Serpens. It contains a young hot star cluster, NGC6611, visible with modest back-garden telescopes, that is sculpting and illuminating the surrounding gas and dust, resulting in a huge hollowed-out cavity and pillars, each several light-years long. The Hubble image hinted at new stars being born within the pillars. Owing to obscuring dust, Hubble's visible light picture was unable to see inside and prove that young stars were forming. Combining both ends of the electromagnetic spectrum - the full spectrum of radiation that takes in everything from visible light to X-rays - the ESA's composite of the Herschel and Newton space telescope images shows hot, young stars 'sculpting' matter around them. The stars detected by the X-ray observations are interacting with the surrounding ultra-cool gas and dust, at only a few degrees above absolute zero, in the process of forming new stars. The near-infrared results showed that 11 of the 'gas globules' detected by Hubble possibly contained stars, and that the tips of the pillars contain stars and nebulosity not seen in the Hubble image . Both wavelengths would be blocked by . Earth’s atmosphere and could only be detected by space telescopes such . as Herschel and Newton. In visible wavelengths, the nebula . shines mainly due to reflected starlight and hot gas filling the giant . cavity, covering the surfaces of the pillars and other dusty structures. At near-infrared wavelengths, the dust becomes almost transparent and the pillars practically vanish.Intricate tendrils of dust and gas are seen to shine, giving astronomers clues about how it interacts with strong ultraviolet light from the hot stars seen by XMM-Newton. Herschel's image makes it possible to search for young stars over a much wider region and thus come to a much fuller understanding of the creative and destructive forces inside the Eagle Nebula.","Composite image looks 'inside' pillars captured in iconic 1995 Hubble photo .

"Oscar winner Halle Berry's ex made 'completely and totally unacceptable' racial slurs against the actress - and dyed their six-year-old daughter's hair blonde, it was revealed in court today. The star took her former love, Gabriel Aubry, to court, accusing him of straightening their little girl Nahla's naturally curly hair and lightening it over the past year in a bid to deny her African-American heritage. As a result, Halle said in court documents, Aubry had caused Nahla 'potential psychological and physical damage' - and could cause her to wonder 'why her natural appearance is not good enough'. A judge ruled today that neither Halle nor Aubry can now change Nahla's hair, while court records obtained by MailOnline show that Aubry has made shocking racist remarks against the star. Mommy and me: Halle Berry and daughter Nahla, six, in LA in October 2013. Nahla's hair is noticeably blonde . Growing it out: Nahla's hair is obviously blonde at the ends after the color grew out. She's pictured with her dad Gabriel Aubry in LA in August 2014 . In a note included on Halle's testimony to the court about her ex's 'reprehensible' actions, she referred to the findings of Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Mark Juhas, who presided over their recent custody case. He said: 'The racial epithet made by Petitioner was and is completely and totally unacceptable. 'Nahla is a child of both of these parents, making this sort of comment about Respondent affect the very core and being of Nahla. 'And when Petitioner attacked Respondent for what she is and who she is, he was attacking Nahla because Nahla is part Respondent. And Nahla is part Petitioner. So when Petitioner did those things, that does serious damage to Nahla because he is attacking her core being, who she is.' Today, a source close to Halle told MailOnline Gabriel had used racially abusive language to Halle - claiming he called her the N word - but said: 'Halle is a great mom, she wants to keep Nahla on an even keel.' Describing Halle's fears over Nahla's hair, the source said: 'Halle kept asking and asking Gabriel about Nahla's hair and he kept denying it. 'What does this say to a six year old who’s half black? Her father is denying her identity. 'Halle then filed the court papers and Nahla's curls came back.' In her testimony, Halle said: 'I strongly feel that Gabriel's same underlying attitude is at the root in the changes which only he could have been causing to our daughter's hair.' She told how she had secured scientific evidence to prove she is not 'delusional', as Gabriel had called her, 'about the extensive damage and the changes to the texture and color of Nahla's hair that were observed by me. I was not willing to allow this to be a 'he said-she said' dispute.' The actress told how she had collected Nahla's hair with a new brush and sent the strands from June 28, 2014, to a laboratory. Darker now: Nahla's hair, although pinned back, is brunette. She accompanies her mom Halle Berry in September 2014 . Heritage: Halle Berry fears her daughter Nahla, seen in LA on Mother's Day in May, will feel her appearance is not good enough if her dad Gabriel Aubry is allowed to continue dyeing and straightening her hair . She said she first noticed a difference in her daughter's hair when Nahla returned from visiting her father in August 2013, saying : 'Gabriel continues to maintain that he has done and is doing nothing to cause the extensive straightening, color changes, stripping and damaging of our daughter's hair. 'I have personally observed the changes in Nahla's hair texture and color over the last year. I have never personally experienced hair damage nor have I ever known a single person whose hair has suffered such excessive changes from spending time in a salt water pool (or even chlorinated water) and sunlight.' Halle put forward 'before and after' photos of Nahla to the court and said: 'I have since reviewed the laboratory report concerning this very hair sample that I obtained, which confirms to me that Gabriel has not been truthful about what he has done and had been doing to our daughter's hair.' The star's mother Judith is white and originally from Liverpool in the UK, while her father, Jerome Jesse Berry is of African-American heritage. And she noted: 'I continue to worry about the potential psychological and physical damage to Nahla that can be caused by the use of chemical hair treatments and the psychological message that it conveys to Nahla, and to implore the court to put a stop to Gabriel's attempts to alter our daughter's appearance and most probably cause her to wonder why her natural appearance is not good enough.' This is the latest court battle for Halle and Aubry, who split in 2010 after four years together, leading to a lengthy custody dispute over Nahla. In 2012, Halle was banned from moving with Nahla to France, where she said they would have more privacy. Little Goldilocks: While Halle Berry was pregnant with son Maceo-Robert, daughter Nahla sported blonde locks, a result, Halle says, of Gabriel Aubry dying their daughter's hair.  Mother and daughter are seen in August 2013 - when Halle says she first noticed Nahla's hair was different . The pair are currently in court as Halle - who became the first the first African American woman to win an Oscar for best actress for Monster's Ball in 2002 - is seeking to cut her monthly child support payments to Aubry. She is making a bid to reduce her monthly payments from about $16,000 to $3,800. But Aubry claims he needs the money because he was unable to book modeling jobs after he came to blows with Halle's husband, French actor Olivier Martinez on Thanksgiving 2012. For her part, Halle alleges that Aubry uses the child support for his own fitness, clothing, electronics, car and health insurance, TMZ has reported. Halle and Martinez, 48,married in July 2013 and welcomed son Maceo-Robert that October. Halle was not at court in Los Angeles on Monday morning, but her lawyer Steve Kolodny was present, along with Gabriel. The source said: 'When Halle has a problem, she just goes to court to settle it. Nahla is a great little girl,  and they are incredibly close. 'Nahla is always foremost in her mind.' In the court papers, Halle said she was keen to work together with Gabriel, adding: 'I want both Gabriel and I to make decisions together that affect our daughter, her growth, her development and her general welfare... 'I continue to hope that Gabriel and I can find a way to work together to be successful co-parents. It was with regret that I concluded that I had to seek the court's intervention on these issues, but until Gabriel recognizes the meaning of joint legal custody and how it is implemented, it appears that hte court will be my only resort to safeguard Nahla's best interests.'","Star takes ex to court - accusing him of dyeing and straightening six-year-old Nahla's hair .

"A 76-year-old man in Texas recently spent nine days in jail for feeding nine strays that are said to have nine lives. David Parton of Gainesville has been giving stray cats food for almost a decade because God told him to 'keep feeding them'. He was arrested earlier this month after racking up $900 in fines and opted to spend nine days behind bars instead of paying. Scroll down for video . David Parton of Gainesville, Texas, was jailed for nine days after refusing to pay fines for feeding stray cats . A Gainesville law makes it illegal to 'make convenient food or containers of food' to feed stray animals . Parton, 76, served his time at the Cooke County Justice Center (pictured) earlier this month . Parton was breaking a city law that makes it illegal to 'make convenient food or containers of food on any property or city street in the City of Gainesville for the purpose of feeding stray animals'. He had previously been cited before for failure to vaccinate cats, the Gainesville Daily Register reported. The feline fan said he hasn't seen the cats he was feeding since he was released from the Cooke County Justice Center and he fears they may be in trouble. Parton claimed he wouldn't have paid the fines if he 'had a million dollars', CBS Dallas reported. He said: 'God told me to keep feeding them and leave the consequences to him. 'I told them I'd sit it out in jail. 'I did, that's why I went to jail, I wouldn't pay the fine. 'That law is not right.' Parton, who claims God told him to feed the cats, said there is no way he would have ever paid the fines . Parton has not seen any of the cats he was feeding since his release and he is worried about their welfare . An animal rights group, Alley Cats Allies, has hired an attorney to give legal advice to Parton . The situation in Gainesville caught the attention of animal rights group Alley Cats Allies. The group has offered support to Parton and is 'working to repeal the local feeding ban so that no one in Gainesville who feeds cats will have to fear legal action, fines, or jail time'. Becky Robinson, president and founder of Alley Cat Allies, said: 'This is a truly disheartening miscarriage of justice. 'Compassion should not be criminalized, but that is exactly what this man was arrested for—simply providing food for cats. 'We are proud to offer any assistance to this gentleman who provides a service to the cats and Gainesville.' The organization hired an attorney from the Tatum Erlandson & Neu law firm for Parton, KX11 reported. Despite the added pressure, Gainesville police are standing by their decision to arrest Parton. Gainesville Chief of Police Kevin Phillips said: 'I think everyone involved in this process had tried to be as compassionate as possible. 'Our prosecutor met with him on two separate occasions, trying to work with him, really all we're looking for is compliance.' Authorities blame feral cats in the area for offenses including destroying ceiling tiles at a business, infecting a local yard with fleas and scratching and biting an eight-year-old girl.","David Parton of Gainesville has been feeding cats for almost a decade .

"A rare collection of Beatrix Potter possessions including a never-seen-before recipe book is due to go on sale - but don't expect to find any recommendations for rabbit stew. The children's author, whose famous creations included The Tale of Peter Rabbit, compiled the collection with her solicitor husband William Hellis. The recipes, which are believed to have been handed down over generations, include sponge cake, roast turkey and curry. Rare find: The Beatrix Potter family heirloom is set to go on auction in, Ludlow, Shropshire on Thursday . The 161-year-old hidden gem was discovered among a trove of Beatrix Potter ephemera which is due to go on sale at Mullock's showroom in Ludlow, Shropshire, on Thursday. Enthusiasts are set to flock to the auction where the collection is expected to sell for several hundred pounds. The recipe book includes hand-written entries believed to originate from Beatrix Potter herself. She married William Hellis in 1913 and the settled in Lancashire but also spent many summers in the Lake District. The earliest entry is from 1851 and the book was updated over many years. Labour of love: Beatrix Potter, left, wrote the recipe book with her husband William Hellis, right. Potter died in 1943 aged 77. Many of her possessions were sold off at a sale in 1954 and it is thought that is where these items came from. But the private owner has now decided to sell them and there is a great deal of interest among enthusiasts. The collection includes a photo of William Hellis from 1910 which has never been seen before. Other items in the sale include legal documents relating to the Heelis family, financial ledgers, a notebook and a New Testament in Gaelic bearing the name “AJ Heelis.” Richard Westwood-Brookes, from the auction house, said: “These form an intriguing insight into the daily life of one of the world’s most loved children’s authors. ""They came from the personal effects of her husband and we understand that the photograph of him as a young man as part of a typical Lakeland shooting party has not been seen before. ""As far as the recipes are concerned, they are clearly the family recipes that had been handed down throughout the generations of William Heelis’s family. ""They therefore came with him into the home he set up with Beatrix Potter. Children's favourite: Beatrix Potter's Peter Rabbit . Home treats: Beatrix Potter recipe for roast turkey . ""It is an intriguing thought that she might well have used this very book to make ginger bread and marmalade and a whole host of other items for the family larder. ""The books have clearly been compiled by various members of the Heelis family over the years, but some sections do seem to be in a hand which resembles that of Beatrix Potter herself. ""While we cannot conclusively prove this, further research may prove that these humble books have a considerable literary significance.” Beatrix Potter published 22 books, beginning in 1902 with the Tale of Peter Rabbit. Her characters and illustrations remain popular worldwide, and her life was the subject of the 2006 film Miss Potter, starring Renee Zellweger. At home with Beatrix: Favourite recipes of children's author revealed . Pluck the bird carefully and singe all over with a piece of white paper; then . wipe it with a clean cloth; draw in and keep the liver and gizard.

"A two-bedroom luxury home in a desirable area is on sale for just £150,000  - but its new owner will have to be willing to adopt an aquatic way of life. The rare 'Oxford Barge' dates back to the 19th century, and was formerly used by university rowers as a changing room and common room. The floating accommodation, for sale on home retail site Zoopla, comprises two double bedrooms, two bathrooms, an open plan lounge and fully fitted kitchen. Luxury: This two-bedroom 'Oxford Barge' is currently on the market for £150,000 . Spacious: The rooms of the home have a homely feel despite being permanently on the river . Tradition: The barges would be used by Oxford college boat clubs for rowing races . A decked bow platform and ballustraded roof terrace - once used to watch rowing races - provide views of the river. It is currently moored in Surrey, but the new owner will need to secure a permanent mooring along the Thames. The barge was built in 1880, and is thought to be one of just six Oxford Barges left in existence. The luxury boats have their origin in London's livery companies, which used them to show off their wealth during the annual Lord Mayor's Show. Maritime: One of the bedrooms has a distinctly naval feel with its small port window . Views: The roof terrace allows the new owner to sit and watch the world go by . Domestic: The barge has its origins in the 19th century but is perfect for modern living too . However, during the 19th century the lavish vessels became so expensive to maintain that the guilds began to see them as too much of a burden. The decline of the London barges coincided with the rise of rowing culture in Oxford, and college boat clubs rushed to snap them up. Colleges used them for accommodation, storing rowing boats and changing rooms to protect the students' modesty. Later, they were remodelled to hold dozens of spectators on their roofs for the college 'bumps' races. Kitchen: The barge has been upgraded since its origins in 1880 . Bathroom: Some might see the £150,000 price tag as a bargain for river-side accommodation . The example currently on sale was one of the last ever made. Lawrence Hall of Zoopla said: 'With the history that comes with this stunning barge, buyers won't have to sacrifice character and charm should they decide to leave dry land behind and plump for a life on the water. 'The spacious interior layout, copious outside space and the flexibility to move your lodgings up and down river as you please means that, for the price, a home on the river can be extremely affordable compared to bricks and mortar.'

"This video of a ghostly white shape floating down a hallway might look like it was taken from the latest science-fiction thriller - but in fact it was captured by a pub's CCTV camera. And the landlord said that this spooky footage is the proof he needed that his pub in Llamelli, west Wales, is visited by supernatural spirits. David Langley-Evans, 49, said he couldn't believe it when he first saw the wispy shape appear in his hallway - and now he wants experts on the supernatural to identify what it was. Scroll down for video . The 'ghost', pictured next to the coffee table, apparently appears from nowhere in the footage captured by the pub's CCTV. Mr Langley-Evans said that he has been experiencing things like this for years . The shape moves down the hallway, towards the camera mounted in the corner of the room. Mr Langley-Evans and his wife said this is the latest in a series of a 'weird and wonderful' experiences at their pub . In the video the 'spirit' apparently appears from the ground, before becoming a more solid white shape and rising into the ceiling. Mr Langley-Evans said: 'I’ve seen it before with my own eyes but now I have proof and people believe me. 'In the 10 years I’ve been at the pub I’ve seen all kinds of ghostly things going on.' Mr Langley-Evans and his wife Christine, 48, have also seen a fish bowl sliding the length of the bar and fall off the end. And they blame the pub’s ancient cellar which dates back to 1830 for the unexplained happenings. He said: 'I often entertain our regulars with the weird and wonderful experiences we have. I’ve heard voices, seen orbs and all kinds of other-worldly things. The 'spirit', just seen beneath the light fixture, rises towards the ceiling in the final shots of the CCTV footage. The landlord said that he thinks the apparition has something to do with his spooky cellar . 'I know this presence isn’t dust catching the light or an insect inside the camera. You have a sense while it’s happening that it’s a spirit. I can’t explain it.' Mrs Langley-Evans said: 'We all think it’s something to do with the cellar. People go down there and come back up crying and refuse to go back down. 'But the whole place is spooky... There’s always been lots of banging and bumps in the night and when you go downstairs there’s no-one there.

"He is barely out of university, but this bright young graduate has come up with an invention that could save countless lives. British inventor James Roberts, 23, has created a baby’s incubator which can be manufactured for £250 ($395). The inflatable device could transform healthcare in poor countries, where the normal £30,000 ($47,500) price of an incubator is unaffordable to all but the most advanced hospitals. Scroll down for video . British inventor has created a cheap and inflatable baby incubator (pictured). James Roberts, 23, graduated from Loughborough University in the summer and was awarded the International James Dyson Award this week. Incubators can cost £30,000 ($47,500). But Mr Roberts' invention can be made for just £250 ($395) It might also be one day used as a portable device by paramedics in the UK, or even as a standby in hospitals. Mr Roberts, who graduated from Loughborough University in the summer,  awarded the International James Dyson Award for design engineers this week. The young inventor, who sold his car to fund the prototype, beat competitors from 18 different countries to win the prestigious prize. A champagne cork-like device that nurtures fledgling embryos inside a woman’s body could halve the cost of IVF, doctors believe. This would give many more women the chances of fulfilling their dream of motherhood. The clear plastic mini-incubator would also make IVF quicker, easier and more natural, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine’s annual conference in Honolulu heard. In a pilot study, women treated using the INVOcell device were just as likely to become pregnant as others. Nine babies have been born so far using the new technique. Mr Roberts, from Leatherhead in Surrey, will spend his £30,000 ($47,500) prize fund on clinical trials for his machine, which he hopes will eventually be adopted in British hospitals and aboard. One in ten babies around the world are born prematurely. Being placed in an incubating machine which regulates temperature and oxygen flow is vital for tiny babies’ survival. Mr Roberts, who gained A Levels in maths, physics and design at the private St John’s School in Leatherhead, before started a product design degree at Loughborough, said he was appalled at the cost of a modern incubator. ‘There is no need for them to be so expensive,’ he said. ‘They are built with very expensive materials and have lots of features you don’t necessarily need, like weight scales and oxygen sensors.’ Mr Roberts' design might also be one day used as a portable device by paramedics in the UK, and it could also be used in developing countries and disaster zones. Sir James Dyson said it could save 'thousands of lives'. Mr Roberts, from Leatherhead in Surrey, will spend his £30,000 ($47,500) prize fund on clinical trials for his machine, which he hopes will eventually be adopted in British hospitals and aboard . He looked at every competent of a state-of-the art incubator and came up with cheaper replacements - ending up with a machine that could be created for less than a hundredth of the price. His main cost saving was achieved by replacing the normal aluminium and rigid glass or plastic frame with a plastic inflatable body. He also replaced the humidifiers and temperature controls with cheaper parts and tore out anything not absolutely necessary. The machine, which he called Mom, ended up with a machine that is portable and cheap. It is heated using ceramic elements, has a digital screen to monitor temperature and humidity, an alarm that sounds if the temperature changes, and special lighting for babies with jaundice. It has already passed engineering tests, but must also undergo stringent medical testing before it is used in the field. Mr Roberts, who gained A Levels in maths, physics and design at the private St John’s School in Leatherhead, before started a product design degree at Loughborough, said he was appalled at the cost of a modern incubator. ‘There is no need for them to be so expensive,’ he said . The design has won the approval of experts in the field. Dr Steve Jones, consultant pediatrician at the Royal United Hospital in Bath said: ‘Mom is a really interesting piece of innovation - I particularly like the integration of phototherapy, as jaundice is a very common co-morbidity alongside prematurity. ‘Its use needn’t be limited to developing world scenarios. I could see it being used in the UK to support community midwifery units, or following home births.’ Sir James Dyson, who launched his award after achieving commercial success with his bagless vacuum cleaners, said: ‘James’ invention shows the impact design engineering can have on people’s lives. ‘The Western world takes incubators for granted - we don’t think about how their inefficient design makes them unusable in developing countries and disaster zones. By bravely challenging convention, James has created something that could save thousands of lives.’","British inventor has created a cheap and inflatable baby incubator .

"A senior Roman Catholic will today use his Christmas sermon to liken plans for the legalisation of gay marriage to the way the Nazis and Communists tried to undermine religion. The Bishop of Shrewsbury will launch a vociferous attack on the Coalition’s decision to fast track a vote on same-sex marriage in the New Year. The Right Reverend Mark Davies will use his midnight Mass to say marriage can only be between a man and a woman. And he will accuse the Prime Minister of attempting to redefine the institution of marriage for ‘generations to come’ without any mandate from the electorate. The Bishop of Shrewsbury will launch a vociferous attack on the Coalition's decision to fast track a vote on same-sex marriage in the New Year . Most controversially, he will equate the support for same-sex marriage with the way totalitarian regimes acted in the twentieth century. The bishop will say that both  Hitler and Stalin challenged Christianity with the notion that what they were doing was ‘progress’. He will argue that, in a similar fashion, the supporters of same-sex marriage also use the idea of ‘progress’ to support the ‘redefinition’ of marriage. The bishop will conclude: ‘The British people have reason to ask on this night where is such progress leading?’ And he will tell the faithful that a moment has arrived for them to ‘stand up for what is right and true as previous generations have done before us: to give witness to the value of every human life, to the truth of marriage as the lasting union of man and woman... the foundation of family.’ In his sermon, Bishop Davies will say: ‘Past generations have gathered in this cathedral on Christmas night amid many shadows which seemed to obscure the future for them. We think of the ideologies of the past century, Communism and Nazism, which in living memory threatened to shape and distort the whole future of humanity. ‘These inhuman ideologies would each challenge in the name of progress the received Christian understanding of the sanctity of human life and the family. Winston Churchill, Britain’s wartime Prime Minister, a man without clear, religious belief, saw in this deadly struggle nothing less than the defence of Christian civilisation. The bishop will say that both  Hitler and Stalin challenged Christianity with the notion that what they were doing was 'progress' ‘Few of our political leaders today appear to glimpse the deeper issues when the sanctity of human life and the very identity of marriage, the foundation of the family, are threatened.’ He will add: ‘This Christmas we are also conscious of new shadows cast by a Government that was pledged at its election to support the institution of marriage. ‘The Prime Minister has decided without mandate, without any serious consideration, to redefine the identity of marriage itself, the foundation of the family for all generations to come. ‘This is again done in the name of progress. The British people have reason to ask on this night where is such progress leading?’ In another part of his sermon, the bishop calls this country’s treatment of the elderly and sky-high abortion rates ‘the darkest shadows of our time’. He will say: ‘The widespread neglect and ill-treatment of the frailest, elderly people in our society: concerns highlighted in the Care Quality Commission’s recent report. The growing concerns about end-of-life care and what is happening to the most vulnerable in our hospitals. ‘This dark side to our society is surely connected to the discarding of human life from the beginning in legalised abortion on an industrial scale, in reproductive technologies, in embryo experimentation which our laws have sanctioned.’ The bishop’s comments come despite the fact that polls repeatedly show the public is largely in favour of allowing gay marriage. Ruth Hunt, of gay rights group Stonewall, said: ‘Gay people are all too aware of the horrific results of Nazi ideology due to the countless casualties of the Holocaust. ‘Bishop Davies’s comments are both deeply offensive to gay people and their families.’ The Coalition has tried to defuse Church of England opposition to its plans by specifically saying it would be illegal for any Anglican vicar to marry a gay couple.","Right Reverend Mark Davies will use his midnight Mass to say marriage can only be between a man and a woman .

"A photographer has lifted the lid on a famously unexplained light phenomenon that appears in an area of the Missouri known as the Devil's Promenade . Locals in the Ozarks hills say they have seen the light and heard the tales of it all their lives. The name of the area is the title of the series, created by artists Lara Shipley and Antone Dolezal,- but the mysterious apparition itself is known to the townspeople in southwest Missouri as the Spook Light. Spook Light appears as a basketball-sized orb of light, but only every so often and only by chance on a road called E50, where the rolling Ozark hills disappear into the endless flatness of Kansas and Oklahoma. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Spooklight Road: Southwest Missouri's West 50 road is famous to area people as where Spook Light, a bright and aptly named anomaly . The light: Artists Antone Dolezol and Lara Shipley traveled to an area of the Ozarks known as Devil's Promenade, a moniker that lent their project its name, in order to try and catch the intermittent, unexplained  phenomenon for which locals have varying explanations . Waiting for light: The Devil's Promenade is an area of southwest Missouri where the rolling hills of the Ozarks give way to the endless flatness of Kansas and Oklahoma . On E50, also known as Spook Road, there's a gathering south of the town of Joplin each year at . Halloween, when hopeful visitors and locals alike seek a chance . encounter with the Spook Light. Meanwhile, the cause of the light--which hovers in the sky and is seen to change colors as it moves towards and away from the viewer--remains a mystery. Even the Army Corps of Engineers once tried to pinpoint the cause of the floating orb. They traveled to the area outside Joplin, a town now known as the 2011 site of a devastating F5 tornado, to study the Spook Light in the early 1940s. They were unable to come to any conclusions. Guesses as to its origins run from everyday expulsions of gas from the areas abundant shale deposits to UFOs. Denizens: The area where the Spook Light is colorful even without the lore. Some locals believe its the ghost of a Civil War soldier, while others say it is an Indian spook . Isolated: The isolated locals manage a living in rural Newton County, where everyone seems have a version of the Spook Light story . Parallels: The series points toward parallels between the Bible Belt area's haunting anomaly and its denizens' struggles to remain in the light, here on Earth and beyond . 'An authentic guide by Bob': Called the Tri-State Spook Light by this guide, the phenomenon occurs on a rural stretch where the Ozarks flow into the endless, flat stretches of Kansas and Oklahoma . MANY NAMES . The Spook Light can be found south of Joplin, Missouri, a town now better known as the site of a devastating F5 tornado in 2011. The anomaly is variously called the Spook Light, Ghost Light, Joplin Ghost Light, Ozark Spook Light, Devil's Jack-O'-Lantern, Hornet Ghost Light, and others. MANY LEGENDS . Like folklore anywhere, the legend of the Spook Light and its origins varies each time its told. Some maintain the light is the torch of a beheaded Quapaw or Osage Indian in search of his lost head. According to another origin tale, the orbs are the spectral remains of the mutual murder of a native man and a white farmer in the woods. Others legends say the light is the ghost of a Confederate soldier or that of a decapitated miner. NO EXPLANATIONS . Despite an attempt in the 1940s by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to study the Spook Light, it's true origins remain a mystery. Some say the lights are the result of gases emerging from the abundant shales in the area. Others blame reflected car headlights, though official reports date back to an 1881 publication called Ozark Spook Light, well before motor vehicles began passing through the area. Luminescence from rotting organic matter has also been fingered, as have UFOs. ONE FORM . While the name and explanations vary, all those who see the Spook Light report it as an orb or several orbs that float on the horizon and can appear to move quite quickly. It is described as being able to change colors from blue to red to gold. 'Its very spooky,' said local Mary Roundtree. 'It looks like a light way far off, and then its right on you.' Roundtree said she saw the light as a kid when she and her parents were lured to E50 out of curiosity. 'My heart was just pounding and it was up in my throat and I thought my head was going to explode and my hands got all cold,' she said. Local . legend has it that the first to see the lights were the local Quapaw . Indians, and some stories saw the light is actually the tormented . spirits of two Quapaw lovers run off a cliff by an angry Chieftan. Other . folklore says the light is the torch of a Quapaw or Osage Indian who . was beheaded and is searching for his head. Still others maintain it's . the spirit of a decapitated miner or Confederate soldier in search of . his lost head. And for every . story behind the lights, there's another name for them. It has been . referred to as the Hornet Ghost Light, Devil's Jack-O'-Lantern, Ozark . Spook Light, and Joplin Ghost Light. Regardless of the tale behind it or its proper name, the locals who've seen the phenomenon are adamant it is real. Roberta Williams from Carthage, Missouri has seen the light . and told her story to Mysterious Universe. Cabin in the woods: Everyone in Newton County has a tale about the light, which some insist is a brilliant red, while others say its a bright blue . Tattooed: A local shows off his devil tattoos. Artists Antone Dolezal and Lara Shipley portray a haunting landscape and the indelible mark it leaves on its inhabitants . ‘It was before midnight,’ she said. ‘It was like a big, huge . ball with a yellow glow and it went right straight through our car. I just . screamed.’ Mary Roundtree, a local historian, told NPR she's seen the light, too. 'Its very spooky,' she said. 'It looks like a light way far off, and then its right on you.' Roundtree said she saw the light as a kid when she and her parents were lured to E50 out of curiosity. 'My . heart was just pounding and it was up in my throat and I thought my . head was going to explode and my hands got all cold,' she said. And like almost everyone else whose seen the bobbing orb, she has her own variation of the tale that's behind it. According . to Roundtree, a old Indian man came across some dead bodies in the . woods where the Spook now appears. After he buried them, a white farmer . came by carrying a lantern. The two killed one another but the light of . the lantern still hangs there as an apparition. The Devil’s Promenade is as dedicated to the the inhabitants of the rural, . impoverished area as it is to the Spook Light. The series paints a vivid picture of both the . haunting landscape and the fascinating people who populate it. 'We . feel the frequent and mysterious appearance of the Spook Light has come . to represent for the people we meet a desire for redemption and the . fear of slipping into darkness,' write Shipley and Dolezal. 'Our aim is . not to provide documentation, but to suggest a narrative that, in the . spirit of the light, is part fixed in this unique region and part afloat . in a mysterious, otherworldly realm.' 'We feel the frequent and mysterious appearance of the Spook Light has come to represent for the people we meet a desire for redemption and the fear of slipping into darkness,' write Shipley and Dolezal . Artist Laura Shipley is based in Lawrence, Kansas where she teaches photography. Antone Dolezal is a New Mexico-based artist and writer who primarily focuses on the American social landscape.","On a road outside Joplin, Missouri, where the rolling Ozarks merge into the endless flatness of Oklahoma and Kansas, locals report seeing a light called the Spook Light .

Supernatural incidents have been reported for years in the 17th century Grade II listed Allerton Hall in Liverpool. But it was not until Monday night that the owners managed to capture 'hard evidence' of a ghostly object in the manor - which is owned by pub chain The Spirit Company. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Ghostly: This is the orb spotted drifting through the Allerton Hall in Liverpool on Monday night . The translucent object drifts through the panels of the 17th century manor moments after closing time . It was discovered by Joe McCann, general manager at the building known as The Pub In The Park, after looking back through security footage. To his horror, the largely uneventful late-night video is interrupted by a translucent object plainly drifting across the screen. He replayed the reel dozens of times, and every time a misty, white ball loops through the oak wood panels before drifting through a wall. Mr McCann said: 'It was a very strange thing to see. 'We’ve all been talking about it and trying to figure out what it actually is. 'Ghost . hunts here in the past have found some strange things like orbs and . other supernatural activity so who knows what’s going on. Horrified general manager Joe McCann said it is the first piece of evidence after years of reported sightings . Eventually it drifts to the right and through a wall of the Grade II listed building built in the early 1600s . 'It’s a different kind of spirit to what we usually deal with anyway. 'I’m not a believer in ghosts but my girlfriend Susan was convinced she’d seen something supernatural. 'When we watched the footage back I couldn’t believe my eyes. The manor of Allerton served as the National Fire Service headquarters during the war. In the centuries before, it housed some of the nation's most prominent figures. It was built in the early 1600s for the . Lathoms, a prominent family in South Lancashire - but they were accused . of treason after the civil war and forced to forefeit their land. Allerton Hall, now known as The Pub In The Park, was the regional fire service based during World War Two . The city's former mayor Richard Percival took over the estate in 1670 and his family passed it down two generations. However, in 1736, the Percivals hit financial difficulties, forcing them to sell up to soon-to-be MP John Hardman, commissioned most of the building which remains today. When he died, Hardman handed Allerton to his butler's son: the celebrated politician, historian and philanthropist William Roscoe. From Allerton, Roscoe wrote his book Life Of Lorenzo de Medici and influential pamphlets calling for the abolition of slavery. His alterations to the house in 1811 involved pulling down the remaining 17th century parts and the building of a library and art space. Mr McCann added: 'I’ll be on the lookout for any more goings on but am hoping this is a friendly ghost.'","Vision spotted on CCTV at Allerton Hall pub, Liverpool, on Monday .

"The U.S. Embassy in Mexico issued a security message Friday warning U.S. citizens to avoid the Pacific resort of Acapulco because of violence and protests. In yet another blow to a coastal city once favored by U.S. movie stars and jet-setters in the 1950s and '60s, the embassy said its personnel 'have been instructed to defer non-essential travel to Acapulco, by air or land,' and added that it 'cautions U.S. citizens to follow the same guidelines.' The alert noted that 'protests and violent incidents continue in Guerrero state in response to the disappearance of 43 students there.' Scroll down for video . A students takes part in a protest by students of the Ayotzinapa school and parents of the 43 missing students in Acapulco on November 19, 2014 . Mexico was confronted with one of the grisliest massacres in years of drug violence after gang suspects confessed to slaughtering 43 missing students and dumping their charcoaled remains in a river . Demonstrators have blocked highways to Acapulco, hijacked buses and blockaded the city's airport to demand the government find the students who disappeared Sept. 26 in the nearby city of Iguala. Prosecutors say local police working for a drug gang probably turned the students over to gang members, who may have killed them and burned their bodies. In early November, demonstrators  blocked Acapulco's airport for hours carrying clubs, machetes and gasoline bombs, causing hotel reservations on a subsequent three-day holiday weekend to fall about 35 percent, said Javier Saldivar, head of Acapulco's business chamber. Hotel occupancy that should have neared 95 per cent was only about 60 per cent. Around 300 students, some wearing masks and armed with sticks and machetes, were joined by some parents of the 43 missing young men as they marched toward the city's airport, but police blocked their way . 'We suffered a serious loss,' Saldivar said. While U.S. tourists account for about 55 percent of foreign visitors to Mexico, relatively few of them go to Acapulco any more. For example, while Mexico's most popular cruise ship port, Cozumel, handled 894 cruise ship arrivals in 2013, Acapulco had only 9. Drug gang violence has also played a role. In recent years there have even been some shootouts on Acapulco's famed coastal boulevard, but those incidents have calmed somewhat in the last two years. A caravan of students and relatives of the missing students, feared to have been massacred, came to Acapulco as part of its journey to the Mexican capital to end November 20 . Acapulco was once a well-regarded destination. It was during a vacation there in the 1960s that novelist Gabriel Garcia Marquez came up with the idea for '100 Years of Solitude.' It was there that Bill Clinton took a young woman named Hillary for a honeymoon in 1975. But in the 1970s and '80s, the resort's infrastructure crumbled, and poor, crowded settlements sprung up inland from the bay, sparking rising problems of unemployment, crime and pollution.","The alert noted that 'protests and violent incidents continue in Guerrero state in response to the disappearance of 43 students there'

"Recent strange events at an Iowa restaurant have the owner and his employees spooked. Pat Orr, owner of Chuck and Edna’s Maid-Rite, in Cascade, enlisted the help of Iowa City Ghost Hunters to investigate a series of unexplained phenomena in the restaurant that started April 14. The first seemingly unexplained disturbance took place just before 6pm April 14. The store’s security camera captures an amorphous shadow . at the restaurant’s dishwashing station that slowly forms into what . looks like a person and drifts off screen. Scroll down for video . Haunted: Pat Orr owns the Maid-Rite in Cascade and says he can't explain the human-shaped shadow that was captured on security footage . Unexplained: Security footage shows this dark shadow in a place in the restaurant where no shadow can be made . The video shows the feet of a . Maid-Rite employee at the edge of the frame, but the employee told Orr . she saw nothing unusual. '(Employees) have been saying they’ve seen strange things ever since the place . opened, and (I) blew it off until I saw the video,' Orr told the . Telegraph Herald. 'It . looks like it’s coming out (from underneath the cooler), goes across . the floor and up over the dishwasher,' Orr said. 'But, you see, I can’t . make a shadow here. I don’t know. I don’t know what it is.' Orr acknowledged the figure could have been an insect on the camera lens. Then, . at about 10am April 19, another security camera shows a stack of . Styrofoam cups sliding off a shelf and hitting a worker in the head, . while another stack falls sideways as if it was pushed. Another night, Orr was alone in the office doing paperwork when he heard a metal spatula fall to the ground, he said. 'It . was on the cooler at the end of kitchen, and I found it on the floor in . the middle of the kitchen in front of the fryer,' as if it had been . flung across the room, Orr said. Spirit or bug? Orr admits the shadow could be a speck or a bug crawling across the camera . Normal day: A staff member was working close-by at the time the footage was captured and noticed nothing out of the ordinary . Not . knowing what to make of the events, a manager typed 'ghost hunters' into the Web browser on his smartphone and pulled up Iowa City Ghost . Hunters. Matthew . O’Brien, 30, of Iowa City, and his team of paranormal investigators . spent the early morning hours one day last month at the restaurant, . recording audio, video and electromagnetic field readings and trying to . re-create the shadow. Among . the devices they use to record paranormal activity is a 'ghost box,' a . modified portable radio that continuously scans AM and FM radio bands. When on, it is believed to create white noise and audio remnants from . broadcast stations that entities are able to manipulate to create words . and sentences. O’Brien said audio and video recording devices are . portals for the supernatural to communicate. The . team also tried to provoke activity by talking to the entity and . placing flashlights on tables around the restaurant, asking the spirit . to turn them off or on to respond to questions. O’Brien, . an entrepreneur by day who is attempting to launch a cleaning service, . said he and his team still are reviewing all the evidence collected and . can’t say whether the restaurant might be haunted. He . would not share what the team encountered during its investigation, . saying Orr signed a confidentiality agreement preventing him from . disclosing evidence gathered. Fall or pushed? A stack of cups falls onto a worker as she prepares food in the Maid-Rite in Cascade . Odd: Cups fell every which way as if they were pushed, says Orr . O’Brien said the team also is researching the history of the property dating back to the 1800s to see what else has been on the land. Orr said the site was a vacant lot when he purchased it about five years ago, but he recalls seeing an old, undated photo that shows a building on the spot that sold ice-cream. At one point, the site also was home to a grocery store, tavern and feed store. Behind the restaurant, across an alley, sits a house that was once a funeral home and next door was an ambulance garage, Orr said. Bradley Burt, Maid-Rite president and CEO, has not seen the tapes and is dubious of the paranormal research. 'But Pat is a good operator, and if it creates some curiosity and interest around town and brings more people to his restaurant, that’s OK,' Burt said. 'He’s having some fun with it, which is fine. I chuckled when I first heard about it. I thought it was amusing. Can’t say I’ve heard of anything similar at other Maid-Rite locations.' Orr remains baffled by the disturbances and has named the supposed ghost Charlie after his father, Chuck. 'Could it have been a bug on the camera lens causing the shadow? I suppose,' Orr said. 'But I can’t explain the cups or the spatula. ... What I do know is my four-year-old niece won’t come in the restaurant. Fortunately, if it is a ghost, it’s been a friendly one so far.'","An Iowa Maid-Rite called in ghost hunters after seeing security footage of an unexplained shadow .

"This eerie footage claims to have captured three ghostly apparitions on camera in one of the most notorious 'haunted' buildings in north-west England.

The team from Sefton Paranormal Investigators noticed the activity - which they say is three children - as they watched back the footage after the investigation. Scroll down for video . The video, taken by paranormal investigators during a night-time project at Stanley Palace, Chester, shows spooky figures standing on the staircase . The team from Sefton Paranormal Investigators noticed the activity as they watched back the footage after the investigation, which took place on June 28 . The ghost hunters chose an area within the 16th century Grade II-listed building to carry out their investigation because a man reportedly died there. Aaron Robinette and Joanne May are seen on the video sitting in front of the staircase, unaware of the shadows moving behind them. Co-founder Pamela Robinette, 44, said: 'After every investigation we look back at the footage to see if we captured anything. 'We couldn’t believe what we could see. There are clearly three figures, which I think are most likely children, on the staircase behind Jo and Aaron. 'And if you look closely you can see her facial features as she turns her head, and her hair looks liked its rolled.

'When we told everyone from the group they were all made up - it made them all want to go back again. They all thought it was absolutely fantastic.

'In the video, Jo and I are sat on the staircase calling out to spirits. 'Nothing happened, but it was only when watching the video back that I saw it. It appears and disappears in shot, all in front of the camera.

"The echoes of departed spirits often show up on camera when those in shot were unaware of their presence. But, as this spine-chilling video shows, sometimes the undead are more than capable of making their presence felt. It purports to show the startling moment that a phantom pushes a man to the floor before seizing hold of his leg and dragging him along a deserted corridor. Scroll down for video . The unknown man wearing the hoodie walks along the corridor unaware of what is about to happen . The man becomes startled when a black shadowy figure appears in front of him . The man falls to the ground as the 'ghost' appears to grab his foot and begins to drag him along the ground . But just as it seems the demonic entity is about to drag its no-doubt accursed victim to the deepest pit of hell, it lets go and vanishes, as mysteriously as it appeared. The minute-long clip, which emerged online, shows footage of unknown provenance shot on a CCTV camera which captures a hoodie-wearing gentleman striding purposefully along a deserted corridor. With few signs of life in the stark, clinical-looking corridor, it is already an eerie scene, but hardly looks like the kind of place where the dead might visit. The clip is silent, presumably since the surveillance camera on which it was shot has no microphone. As the man reaches the end of the corridor a forbidding shadow-like apparition materialises ahead of him. The terrified victim is continued to be dragged across the ground by his foot . Man and 'ghost' appear to be locked in a tussle on the floor as the victim tries to get on his feet . His previous confidence evaporates as he is knocked to the ground by the spectral assailant. Before he can react, it snatches hold of his left leg, dragging him along on his back. The victim of the supernatural attack, whose identity is not known, must have thought his days were numbered. He may have feared he would spend the whole of the rest of eternity in a pit of hellfire. But without warning, the wraith relinquishes its grip and, as quickly as it materialised, it dissolves. Terrified, its victim, scrambling to his feet, flees in the very direction he has just come from. The 'ghost' releases its grip and the hooded man is left lying on his back on the floor . He then struggles to his feet, still shocked by his supernatural experience . The video's origin is unknown, but it has made its was to YouTube where it has received nearly a million views on one channel. Commenters were mixed in their opinions as to its authenticity. Cassandra Jordan wrote that she fell victim to a similar supernatural attack as a teenager. 'I saw this dark entity looking at me with red eyes,' she wrote. Terrified, he runs back in the direction from which he came not wanting to repeat the experience . Not looking back, the victim, caught on CCTV, continues to run for his safety . 'I tried to run but it grabbed me and dragged me back in my room. I passed out i didn't know what happen after that all I know is that I wake up running to my older sister and scratching her uncontrollably.' But others dismissed it as a ultimately flawed attempt at amateur computer-generated imagery. Mongodos wrote: 'Hey good attempt at cgi. Salute.

"A bar in Bolton has renewed its claim to be 'Britain's most haunted pub' after new footage emerged of a 'ghost' appearing at an upstairs window. Tony Dooley, who runs Ye Olde Man and Scythe in Greater Manchester, feared his premises were haunted earlier this year when CCTV appeared to show a ghostly figure standing at his bar during the night. He now says he's been left in no doubt that there are ghosts in the pub after  another video, apparently shot by a tourist, emerged showing a second apparition. Scroll down for video . Ye Olde Man and Scythe in Bolton has appeared in a second spooky video after a tourist  filmed a strange flickering light in an upstairs window of the centuries-old tavern . The latest video is believed to have been filmed by a Portuguese visitor to the area who was talking about the original incident, which happened at the 763-year-old pub earlier this year. As he describes the pub's 'haunted' history, a strange flickering light appears at an upstairs window. Manager Mr Dooley, 36, says the footage has left him certain that he is living among ghosts. He said: 'I'm not too happy about it. That's my flat behind the window. My attitude before I became the manager nine months ago was not to believe in ghosts. I'm convinced now.' He also claims that, a few weeks ago, he was woken by what he thought was his partner's pet dog, Kallie, licking his feet, but he looked over to discover the animal was asleep. He added: 'My feet were clammy and wet, like sweaty palms only worse. I went straight to the bathroom and took a shower with the dog in the room making sure nothing else happened.' Mr Dooley, manager of the pub, lives in a flat behind the window where the flickering light appeared . He said: 'It was creepy, but my attitude is as long the ghost doesn't harm me then that's fine.' In February, Mr Dooley investigated smashing glass in the bar area overnight and saw a 'figure' appear on CCTV footage. It is claimed the pub, the fourth-oldest in Britain, is haunted by the ghost of James Stanley, the seventh Earl of Derby and royalist. It is believed he spent the last hours of his life at the inn before he was beheaded in 1651 in the final months of the English Civil War. Hundreds of soldiers and civilians were also killed outside the pub, which dates from 1251, during the Bolton Massacre in 1644.

"The £653million spent on drugs to stave off a flu pandemic was ‘money thrown down the drain’, a damning report found yesterday. The drugs – Tamiflu and Relenza – were stockpiled at huge cost by health chiefs in the hope they could stem the effects of a pandemic. The mass purchase was triggered in 2005 when Government scientists warned that as many as 700,000 Britons could die from deadly bird flu. The mass purchase of Tamiflu and Relenza was triggered in 2005 when Government scientists warned that as many as 700,000 Britons could die from deadly bird flu . After millions of doses were stockpiled, spending on the drugs escalated still further with the outbreak of swine flu (H1N1 virus) in 2009, the first pandemic in 40 years. The anti-viral medicines were purchased to reduce admissions to hospital and dangerous complications from flu such as pneumonia. But the drugs work no better than remedies such as paracetamol, according to an analysis by researchers. There are also claims that vital information from clinical trials was withheld from regulators, researchers and doctors. The report, which analysed data from published and unpublished trials, concludes there is no evidence to show that the drugs reduce hospital admissions or complications. It also says the two drugs do shorten the symptoms of flu but only by half a day – about the same as some over-the-counter drugs. The review by Cochrane, an independent, international network of researchers, also found Tamiflu had side effects including a higher risk of psychiatric and kidney symptoms. The authors of the report, published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), called for an immediate end to stockpiling of the drugs on the basis of the evidence. Dr Carl Heneghan, professor of evidence-based medicine at Oxford University, said: ‘The money spent has been thrown down the drain. There is no credible way these drugs could prevent a pandemic.’ The drugs worked no better at relieving symptoms than over-the-counter medicines but had potential to ‘cause great harm’, he said. A second author, Dr Tom Jefferson, a clinical epidemiologist, said: ‘The evidence doesn’t justify stockpiling – we should stop it.’ The investigators said there had been . ‘multi-system failure’ which included the role of regulators, the . European Medicines Agency – which approved licensing of the drug in . Europe – and the drugs watchdog Nice. Spending on the drugs escalated still further with the outbreak of swine flu (H1N1 virus) in 2009, the first pandemic in 40 years . Investigators from Cochrane say the original evidence the drug companies gave to the Government was incomplete. They used a huge amount of data only made available by manufacturers Roche and GlaxoSmithKline after ‘years of struggles’, said BMJ editor-in-chief Dr Fiona Godlee. The findings, based on 46 trials involving more than 24,000 people, cast doubt on whether the drugs are worthwhile fighting flu and suggest ‘insufficient grounds’ for using Tamiflu as a preventive measure. Roche said it ‘fundamentally disagreed’ with the findings. Between 2006-07 and 2012-13 the Department of Health spent £609million on antiviral medicines, £473million on Tamiflu and £136million on Relenza. This includes £74million written off because poor record keeping meant medicines had to be thrown away. The swine flu pandemic claimed 457 lives in the UK between June 2009 and April 2010. There were no human cases of bird flu in the UK. The latest review follows a highly critical report in January from MPs on the Public Accounts Committee which warned that a further £49million was at stake because drugs running out of shelf life were due to be replaced. But the DH confirmed last night that a 2008 contract with Roche meant the drugs had been delivered and the money spent in 2013/14 . But Professor Wendy Barclay, chair in influenza virology at Imperial College London, said other evidence showed the drugs benefited sick pregnant women and stockpiling had been ‘prudent’. Roche UK medical director Dr Daniel Thurley said: ‘Roche stands behind the wealth of data for Tamiflu. The report’s methodology is often unclear and inappropriate, and their conclusions could potentially have serious public health implications.’ The Department of Health said: ‘Tamiflu is licensed around the world for the treatment of seasonal flu and is a licensed product with a proven record of safety, quality and efficacy. We regularly review all published data and will consider the Cochrane review closely.’","Tamiflu and Relenza were stockpiled to stave off a flu pandemic .

"Scroll down for video . You would typically expect a ghost's tipple of choice to be a spirit, but a haunted pub claims to have a phantom with a penchant for red wine. Staff at the Carlisle Castle Hotel in Newtown, Sydney, have noticed a series of spooky happenings in recent weeks with many incidents even captured on camera. They have seen bottles and glasses smash to the ground despite no one standing anywhere near them. But it appears that only one type of alcohol is the focus of these spooky occurrences - $27 bottles of red wine. Spooky: Customers spin around in shock as a bottle of red wine falls off a shelf and smashes on the counter . Haunted: Another bottle of wine mysteriously falls from a shelf while a customer searches in a fridge . Peter Bradbury, licensee of the Carlisle Castle Hotel, has set up a Facebook to document the activity. He told the Inner West Courier: 'We have the cameras on when we're doing the tills and we've seen a few strange things. 'It's all very strange. I don't know how long it's been coming but it's become quite a regular in the last few weeks. There's been a few bottles of wine falling off the shelf.' Mr Bradbury added that if a ghost is behind the events, they certainly have good taste, as only expensive red wines are targeted. He said: 'Red wine seems to be the choice, apparently he likes the red. Expensive wine too, he picked a Kilikanoon last night, which is about $27 a bottle.' A strange light, which in the footage appears to be shaped like a human, can be seen in front of the table . Staff at the Carlisle Castle Hotel in Sydney, have noticed a series of spooky happenings in recent weeks . Other strange events include a beer tap apparently turning on by itself, lights flickering on and off, and strange shadows 'dancing' around the room. Some patrons have offered up their own suggestions on Facebook as to who may be responsible. One theory is that it could be 'Old Peter' - an elderly man who worked in the pub in the early 1990s. Others are convinced the ghost is Mr Bradbury's predecessor, Johnny Hoy. More cynical souls have suggested a vibrating fridge motor or poor shelf-stacking are to blame, pouring cold water on the 'Scooby Doo mystery' one drinker likened the situation to. Mr Bradbury is yet to be convinced by any of the theories put forward however, saying he still has no idea what's behind the really behind the strange occurrences. 'When we saw the bottles and glasses just start flying off shelves, we saved it and put it up on our Facebook page for a bit of a laugh really but we don't know what it is,' he said.","Staff at the Carlisle Castle Hotel in Sydney have noticed spooky incidents .

"The man who was put behind bars for obsessively texting his former girlfriend before she fell 11 storeys to her death has been released from jail after just 10 days as neighbours recount what they witnessed on that fateful night. Cheerleader Breeana Robinson, 21, fell from the balcony of the Gold Coast high-rise apartment of her controlling boyfriend, Dan Shearin in January last year. Shearin was sentenced to six months in jail on October 27 after pleading guilty to using a carriage service to menace or harass Ms Robinson who received 1,439 text messages from him before she died. At what was expected to be a straight forward bail application at Southport District Court on Thursday, Judge Terence Martin recommended Shearin's lawyers appeal the case, Gold Coast Bulletin reported. 'If the words were spoken face-to-face, there would be no illegality,' Judge Martin said. 'He can't be punished for having a bad personality.' Scroll down for video . Breeana Robinson, 21, pictured with Dan Shearin, who sent her 1,439 abusive text messages before she died . Shearin's neighbour Gina Hadid saw Ms Robinson: 'go past me fast, like a flash of light' Gina's husband Buddy Hadid (right) was the first to reach Ms Robinson who was still breathing at the time . Meanwhile, Gina and Buddy Hadid, who live on the fourth floor of the same building as Shearin, have spoken out about what they saw the night that Ms Robinson plummeted to her death. 'Never ever will I forget this in my life. It will stay in me for the rest of my life,' Gina told ACA. 'I just heard her scream, something go past me fast, like a flash of light.' 'I'm 100 percent sure I heard her saying 'no' or 'oh no'. So I did hear her screaming and saying something when she went past me.' 'I went to look over and I saw her lying there, not moving in her underwear and I quickly ran inside and called to my husband 'Buddy wake up, call the police.' Buddy Hadid and a security guard were the first to reach Ms Robinson. 'I called the ambulance on my phone. I was talking to the ambulance. The security guard and I were taking it in turns one was doing CPR and one was talking to the ambulance and then we swapped over, 'Mr Hadid said. Mr Hadid said Shearin was calm when he arrived at Ms Robinson's body . Breeana Robinson, pictured left in both images, was bombarded with 1439 text messages by ex-boyfriend Dan Shearin in the month before she died . Mr Haddin said he first saw Shearin within a minute of exiting the building. 'We were trying to work out who she was and he just turned around and said ""oh that's my girlfriend"",' Mr Haddin said. 'He was perfectly calm, he was calmer than what I was.' Just seven days after his girlfriend's death, Shearin went on a holiday to Bali where he posted pictures of himself enjoying massages. When he returned from his trip, Mr Hadid claims Shearin threw a party at the same unit where Ms Robinson fell from. Judge Martin said Shearin should receive bail because his appeal was unable to be heard before November 17. Dan Shearin (right) was sentenced to six months behind bars on October 27over the death of his girlfriend Breeana Robinson, who fell to her death in January 2013 . Ms Robinson's family carried pink flowers into court last month to show their support for Ms Robinson . Ms Robinson's auntie Janine Mackney and cousin Edyn carried pictures of her to court . He pleaded guilty to using a carriage service to menace or harass earlier in October. On Monday a court heard Ms Robinson received the last text message from her boyfriend, whom she had been living with for a little over a month, just ten minutes before her death. Friends and family of Ms Robinson wore pink and handed out flowers of the same colour in support of the 21-year-old. Shearin (right) is said to have bombarded his girlfriend with thousands of text messages before her death . Earlier this month the cruise ship entertainer (right) pleaded guilty to using a carriage service to menace or harass . The cheerleader's family also handed out the flowers to other attendees in a show of solidarity . Supporters also carried pictures of the young cheerleader, who had dreams of becoming a dancer despite having been legally blind since a young age. In the 38 days Ms Robinson was with Shearin before she fell to her death he sent her 1439 text messages, Southport Magistrate's Court heard earlier this month. At 10.35pm on January 29, 2013 after she returned from cheerleading practice Ms Robinson fell from their luxury apartment, H20 Broadwater in the Gold Coast suburb of Southport. Horror scene: Ms Robinson fell from their luxury H20 Broadwater complex in Southport, on the Gold Coast . The athletic, but slight, young woman fell the eleven storeys on to a Perspex awning above the shops and restaurants at the base of the iconic building. The court heard evidence that in one text message sent to Ms Robinson ten minutes before she died, Shearin said: 'You're more interested in TV, food and everything else but your partner. That's why everything's ruined. Your priorities are f***ed up'. In another text message sent to Breanna that was heard in court, Shearin said: 'You're a complete f***ing moron. I don't want a stupid, dumb c***'. Police investigating the death charged Shearin with using a carriage service to menace or harass Ms Robinson. He pleaded guilty. Mr Shearin poses with two waitresses . 'I love jealous bitches who can't handle rejection': Excerpts from Dan Shearin's Facebook page. 'Reach out to someone': More snippets from the cruise ship entertainer's Facebook page . Ms Robinson, who was legally blind from a young age, had been drawn to cruise ship entertainer Shearin through his promises of helping the pretty blonde to realise her dreams of a dancing career. Shearin, who describes himself on Google Plus as 'Australia's premiere cruise ship vocalist/author & cruise ship specialist' was Ms Robinson's first boyfriend. Shearin, who friends of Ms Robinson's said is obsessed with Facebook and dating sites, has called girls 'bitches' and a 'psycho' on another of his Facebook pages. On September 21, he posted, 'Haha. I love jealous bitches who can't handle rejection. One has set up an account on grindr with my phone number thinking that it might somehow embarrass me. 'Talk about psycho just coz she couldn't f*** me lol. She is so stupid that she doesn't realise that it is a criminal offence these days.' Friends of Ms Robinson told Daily Mail Australia how the 'lovely young woman' who had struggled at school because of a chronic astigmatism called 'cat's eye', would have done anything to become a dancer. 'She believed Dan would help her achieve that goal,' the friend said, on condition of anonymity. 'She was the sweetest, kindest person, unaffected and always apologising,' the friend said. Breanna Robinson was bombarded with 1439 text messages in the month before she took her own life . Dan Shearin, pictured with a pet dog . Ms Robinson, who was unable to drive a car because of her sight problems, fought to be independent, and had travelled overseas to see the Moulin Rouge in Paris. 'She idolised Gold Coast dancer Anthony Ikin,' the friend said. 'She knew she couldn't be a Moulin Rouge dancer, but she hoped to dance professionally and that's how she and [Dan Shearin] met. 'He promised to help her get work on cruise ships.' Shearin has written a book, Confessions of a Neurotic Cruise Ship Singer, which has a subtext of sex and romance. Shearin, who recently returned from a trip to Canada to appear at Southport Court, has reportedly fronted 'Las Vegas style' productions says on his Facebook page he has performed 'in over 30 different shows on cruise ships'. On June 15 this year, he posted on Facebook, 'It just dawned one day as I walked along the beach that no matter how many dating sites I join, however many places I go, or how much time I spend searching for the right woman, none of it is going to speed up the process because the Universe has a plan and when the time is right, she will appear no matter how much time I spend in solitary.' 'Time to live life and stop waiting.' On July 25, he posted: 'So sad to hear that another young woman has committed suicide from a Surfers hi-rise tonight. 'My heart goes out to her family and all those innocent people who saw her land. 'Having witnessed this exact same situation myself, I hope those affected seek counselling.' Following Ms Robinson's death, Shearin moved from the H20 apartment block and is now believed to be working for a Gold Coast time share company. The investigation into the 21-year-old's death remains open.","Breeana Robinson fell to her death from 11th floor balcony of Shearin's apartment in January last year .

"Water can be made to appear to flow in a remarkable corkscrew shaped stream by means of a simple experiment involving the right frequency of bass and a video camera with an adjustable frame rate. A mesmerising YouTube video shows how one amateur scientist made the flow appear to stay still then, by adjusting bass frequency, rotate in both directions. The video, uploaded along with a how-to guide by user brusspup on Monday, has already gone viral - attracting nearly 500,000 views and nearly 18,000 'thumbs up'. Corkscrew: Water can be made to appear to flow in a remarkable corkscrew shaped stream by means of a simple experiment involving the right frequency of bass and a video camera with an adjustable frame rate . Brusspup said on the video-sharing site: 'This is a really fun project and when you first see the results, chances are your jaw will drop.' The effect cannot be seen with the naked eye, so anyone who wants to try it at home will have to first get their hands on a camera capable of shooting at exactly 24 frames per second. To recreate the effect, the first thing you will need to do is get hold of an amplifier and a speaker with a frequency response low enough to reach 23hz - a very low bass sound. Connect the speaker to a computer running tone generating software - many such programs are available as open-source freeware - and tune it down to 24hz . Take a soft rubber hose and connect that to your tap, then run it down past the speaker, across the cone, so that one or two inches hang past the bottom of the case, and tape it securely into place. Optical illusion: The effect cannot be seen with the naked eye, so anyone who wants to try it at home will have to first get their hands on a camera capable of shooting at exactly 24 frames per second . 'The goal is to make sure the hose is touching the actual speaker so that when the speaker produces sound (vibrates) it will vibrate the hose,' brusspup explains. Point the camera at the end of the hose, turn on your tap, press play on your tone generator and, as brusspup puts it: 'Watch the magic begin'. The effect can be changed by altering the frequency of the tone. Set it to 23hz and it will look like it's moving backwards. Set it to 25hz and the stream will appear as though its moving forward in slow motion. Variable: The effect can be changed by altering the frequency of the tone. Set it to 23hz and it will look like it's moving backwards. Set it to 25hz and the stream will appear as though its moving forward in slow motion . One of the top rated comments on the video's YouTube page explains how it works. User necraduq explains: 'When the frequency of the speaker is the same with the frequency of the video frames (frames/sec) the camera actually captures the same frame everytime and thus the same water shape. 'You can see the change 1hz makes when filming (if filming is kept at the same rate 24fps) as this translates into a ""forward movement"". 'Imagine a clock with only a seconds indicator. If you would close your eyes and open them precisely once every 60 seconds you would think the indicator is not moving.'","Video explaining the optical illusion has gone viral on YouTube .
Vibrations from a very low sine wave give the stream its shape .
But it can only be viewed through a camera with the right frame rate ."
"A woman who awoke in the middle of the night to find her five-year-old daughter being kidnapped by a stranger has revealed 'woman's intuition' made her know something was wrong. Stephanie Holladay Edson and her husband Aaron Edson woke early on Friday morning to find their daughter Lainey being carried across the front yard of their home in Sandy, Utah - allegedly by Troy Morley, 48. After a calm interaction between Aaron Edson and Morley, the little girl was handed back to her family unharmed. Morley was later found inside a neighbor's home and arrested. Speaking exclusively to Good Morning America on Monday, Mr Edson, 37, revealed that there were no noises in the home that woke them up - and instead thanked his wife's 'woman's intuition'. Scroll down for video . Thankful: Stephanie and Aaron Holladay Edson spoke with GMA on Monday about the terrifying moment they found their five-year-old daughter had been snatched from their home in the middle of the night . Safe: Lainey, pictured left with her mother, step dad and brothers, is back home safe after Friday's scare . 'We were asleep and I woke up - not to a noise,' she explained. 'Nothing woke me up. I looked at my cell phone - it was 4.07. I remember thinking, ""I'm not tired, I'm awake, this is weird"".' 'I was fully mentally alert and because I was awake, I was able to hear the things that... saved my daughter.' She said that she heard a dull thud and her daughter's voice, but could not hear her daughter walking. The girl has a minor physical handicap that gives her a recognizable gait pattern, she said. 'There was no footsteps,' her mother, 32, said. 'There was her voice without her footsteps... I knew something was wrong.' At that point, she woke up her husband, yelling: 'She's outside! She's outside!' Mr Edson jumped from the bed and the couple found their daughter's door open, her light on and her bed empty. He ran outside. Emotional: Stephanie said that she awoke at 4am and immediately knew that something was wrong . Heroic: Aaron ran outside and asked the kidnapper what he was doing, before calmly convincing him to hand the little girl back over. He said no one raised their voices and that the handover was peaceful . 'I was just looking for Lainey,' Mr Edson explained. 'I wanted to get her back in a way that was not upsetting to her.' He called out gently and then he saw the man carrying his step-daughter - who was still holding on to a story book - away from the home. 'What are you doing?' he asked. Morley explained to the father that he was in trouble and 'if he had her with him then they wouldn't kill him,' Edson recounted. Mr Edson said that he wanted to help but that he couldn't take the girl with him. The man handed over the little girl without any trouble, he said. 'Just peacefully and calmly and nobody's voice ever got raised,' he said. The couple said their daughter was smiling and was even excited that she would get to stay up until the morning. Saved: The five-year-old girl is carried to the family's home on Friday, hours after the ordeal . They called 911 and alerted police, who found Morley inside a neighbor's home. 'It came so close to being something horrible,' Mr Edson said. It was 'a very close call... If it has to happen, if this is the way it has to end, it's just perfect.' The five-year-old girl wasn't hurt in the frightening experience, but the incident has evoked haunting echoes of when 14-year-old Elizabeth Smart was snatched out of her Salt Lake City bedroom in 2002. She was held captive for nine months before being found. The abduction attempt was not targeted, but a random incident, said Sandy Police Sgt. Dean Carriger. The family said they don't know Morley. The intruder was in the family's basement searching through things when he came upon the girl sleeping in her bedroom, Carriger said. Police don't know what his motive was. Caught: Troy Morley, 46, is seen here being led in the jail after he was released from the hospital on Friday afternoon. He was bitten on the shoulder by a police dog before his arrest . In custody: Police say Morley had been wandering through the neighborhood trying to find open doors and windows to break into a home. He entered the house through an unlocked side door . 'It obviously was a very scary, traumatic situation,' Carriger said. 'The sanctity of our home is huge and for somebody to enter that and grab your child, it's got to be one of the worst nightmares a parent could face. 'If those parents were not awakened to go out and investigate, he could have easily left undetected with the girl.' After the 911 call, officers set up a perimeter, and with the help of police dogs, launched a search. Mugshot: A booking photo from 2012 shows Troy M. Morley, who was arrested on Friday . The suspect went into a second home two blocks away through a doggy door in an attempt to evade capture. The dogs at that house alerted the residents, who yelled at police already in the area to come get him. Police captured Morley outside the second home thanks to a police dog that bit the suspect in the upper shoulder, Carriger said. He was arrested and booked on charges of child kidnapping, burglary, trespassing and resisting arrest. Morley isn't on Utah's sex offender registry and online court records only show a pair of divorces and DUI charges. Family spokesman Miles Holman called it a miracle that the parents woke up in time. 'Thirty seconds later and it would have been all over,' Holman said. 'He would have been long gone.' The family's backyard butts up against a canal that separates the neighborhood from a bustling shopping center in the heart of Sandy, a city of 90,000 people that, like most parts of Utah, is predominantly Mormon. 'Things like that just don't happen around here,' said Melissa Johnson, 26, who is staying in her parents' house that is next to the home where the abduction event occurred. She said her younger sibling heard screams and commotion in the early morning and came to sleep with her downstairs. Johnson said they attend the same Mormon congregation as the family. 'I've been thinking that the Heavenly Father had a hand it,' Johnson said. 'He was protecting them. . . I just hope it won't be traumatizing for the little girl.' Johnson and other neighbors say it's a scary thought that a man capable of snatching a child was roaming their neighborhood in the night. Scene: Troy Morley allegedly broke into this house in quiet Sandy, Utah, by slipping in through an unlocked window. Once inside, he found a five-year-old girl, whom he tried to abduct, police say . Taken away: Sandy Police drive the suspected kidnapper to the Salt Lake County Jail on Friday . April Parry, a mother of three children who lives down the street, said she and her husband are considering an alarm system. 'That is your biggest fear as a parent,' Parry said. 'It can happen anytime, that's what makes it scary.' About 45 miles north in Roy, where Morley lived, neighbors said they weren't the least bit surprised to find out the man known as a super creep had been accused of trying to abduct a girl. Next-door neighbor Andrea Shearer, 33, said she forbid her children to interact with Morley after a series of bizarre and inappropriate conversations. Shearer said Morley had been caught sneaking into backyards, including hers. She obtained a no trespass order on him from police. She said she believes Morley had a meth addiction. He talked about a satanic cult causing his wife to leave him and having critters crawling through the attic, she said. 'He scared me. I'm so glad he's gone,' said Shearer, a health care professional. 'You always hear people saying about their neighbor that they seemed so quiet and normal. Not him, I'm not surprised.'","Aaron and Stephanie Edson awoke early on Friday morning to find their daughter Lainey missing from her bed in Sandy, Utah .

"The local hunter suspected of killing and eating a missing German tourist has a tattoo of a notorious cannibal tribe on his shoulder, it emerged yesterday. Henri Haiti is on the run after the remains of Stefan Ramin were found round a campfire on the French Polynesian island of Nuku Hiva earlier last week. A photograph of Haiti, 31, pictures him with a distinctive tattoo just below his left shoulder, which shows a warrior from the Kaioi tribe, who were said to eat their victims. Link: Henri Haiti's body art on his left shoulder depits a warrior from the Kaioi tribe, who were known for eating their victims . According to experts, the Kaioi tribe used to live on the same island where 40-year-old Mr Ramin's charred remains were found. Haiti, who was a member of the island's canoe club, sports the image of a Kaioi warrior in a canoe on his upper body, according to German tattoo expert Joerg Klein. Pacific islanders have denied the claims that Mr Ramin was eaten by cannibals after insisting: 'We prefer hot dogs to people'. Fears that outdoor fanatic Mr Ramin had been cooked and devoured erupted after his charred remains were found on a campfire on Nuku Hiva following a goat hunt. Although locals described their shock at the island being linked to cannibalism, a picture of Haiti revealed that he sports a tattoo of a Kaioi warrior on his left shoulder. Cannibal expert Dr Gundolf Kruger said: 'Polynesians are now Christian and literate, therefore pious and educated. But it is entirely possible that the criminal was led by old rituals into this crime.' World tour: Stefan Rami and Heike Dorsch at one of the idyllic locations they visited before the horrific episode . Journalist Alex Du Prel on the neighbouring island of Tahiti said locals were shocked at claims Mr Ramin had been eaten. He wrote in his Nouvelles de Tahiti newspaper: 'Trust me, we'd rather eat hot dogs than humans around here. 'These tales of flesh-craving islanders are totally invented. 'Believe me, French civilisation has taught these people to eat cheeseburgers and canned food, not people. And the wild pigs we breed here are far tastier.' Mr Ramin had been sailing around the world with girlfriend Heike Dorsch, 37, for three years when they stopped on Nuku Hiva on September 16. The day he disappeared he had gone with his guide Haiti to hunt goats. The German traveller is feared to have been eaten during his visit to French Polynesia . Ms Dorsch said Haiti later returned to their boat without Ramin and tied to convince her to come into the jungle, saying her boyfriend had been injured. When she refused, she claimed he tied her to a tree and tried to sexually assault her. She escaped and raised the alarm but Haiti had fled, police said. The hunter is said to have 'an unrivalled knowledge' of the densely forested terrain and would 'probably find it easy' to elude his pursuers, officials said. The 40-year-old from the small town of Haselau in north-west Germany was on a round-the-world trip with girlfriend Heike Dorsch, 37, when they anchored off the coast of the Polynesian island on September 16. Mr Ramin and Miss Heike began their travels in 2008 and dropped anchor in Nuku Hiva last month . He went off on a goat hunt with Haiti - a guide registered with authorities on the island - and never returned. It was only on Wednesday last week that the human remains were found. Among the embers were bones including a jaw bone, teeth and melted metal - believed to be fillings. Mr Ramin, a fanatical sailor, was a former business adviser. He kept a regular blog of his trip begun in 2008 and one of his last entries read: 'I seek freedom and adventures'. A family friend said: 'It is a tragedy that a man with such a zest for life should have his days ended in such a brutal fashion.' He bought his catamaran Baju in Turkey and had planned to spend the next two years island hopping in the South Pacific. The island of Nuku Hiva has a population of around 2,000 . On Facebook, he listed his interests as 'travelling, blue water sailing, kiting, kitesurfing, windsurfing, surfing, diving... actually everything which one can do on and under the water'. Last month, they dropped anchor in Nuku Hiva, largest of the Marquesas islands, which over the centuries have featured in many reports of cannibalism. Deborah Kimitete, deputy mayor of Nuku Hiva, told local news website Les Nouvelles: 'No one can believe what has happened. This has never happened here before, this is the first time, it's horrible.' It was not clear whether Miss Dorsch is still on the island or whether she has returned home to Germany. Nuku Hiva has a population of just over 2,000 and featured in the stories of Herman Melville, author of Moby Dick.","Wanted man 'has tattoo of cannibal warrior on his shoulder'

The video was produced by TouchCast, a New York-based video technology used by the BBC, and Emmy award-winning director Michael Jurkovac, who was behind the viral video sensation Yes We Can in support of Barack Obama’s 2008 Presidential campaign. With #IMAGINE, UNICEF hopes to bring awareness to the fact that in many countries, children have to imagine having the basic human rights that allow others of their age to be children. UNICEF hopes to inspire people to take action to fight for global children’s rights and raise funds via donations and iTunes royalties from the song’s purchase to finance their efforts. Donations will be used to support UNICEF’s health, education and sanitation projects in 150 countries. 'The Convention on the Rights of the Child asked us all to imagine a better world for children – and calls on all of us to make that vision a reality,” said UNICEF Executive Director Anthony Lake. 'The #IMAGINE project gives people across the globe a chance to join a global movement for children, lending their ideas, their visions and, not least, their voices to advance the rights of every child, everywhere.'

"A woman who was kidnapped from a motel parking lot and shoved into a black Acura by four women was covered in bite marks all over her body, and even on her face, when police found her. The woman, who has not been named was kidnapped from a Motel 6 parking lot off Southside Commercial Parkway in Jonesboro, Georgia, on Sunday, according to police. She is described as a 21-year-old white female who might have been taken at gun point. Police say they found a firearm in the getaway car. Arrest: Police put one woman in handcuffs and have identified the suspects as Kyneisha Norman, 32, Shataya Durham, 17, Jasmine McCloud, Davel Locker, 17, and Teona Willis, 34 . Taken: Eyewitnesses called 911 and gave a description of the vehicle to police . The incident is being treated as a case of sex trafficking by authorities, who found the woman sobbing and terrified after a police chase four miles away from the motel. A spokesperson from Jonesboro police said eyewitnesses saw five people shove the woman into a car in the parking lot of the Motel 6 and called 911, to give a description of the vehicle. Most of the suspects appeared to be women and were driving a black Acura car. They have been identified as Kyneisha Norman, 32, Shataya Durham, 17, Jasmine McCloud, Davel Locker, 17, and Teona Willis, 34. Officer Cornell Madison from the Jonesboro Police Department said he spotted the car after police asked officers to look out for the vehicle. He told WSB-TV: 'I saw the vehicle drive by and I did a u-turn, followed the vehicle and made a traffic stop. '[I waited] until it was safe for myself and the victim as well.’ Rescuer: Officer Cornell Madison from the Jonesboro Police Department saw the vehicle  and stopped it . Kidnapped: The woman was taken from the parking lot of a motel 6 off Southside Commercial Parkway . ‘When I walked up to the vehicle, the victim did have tears in her eyes and I asked her name and she didn't really want to tell me, but she seemed relieved to see me,’ he added. Officer Madison found the victim inside the car along with four women and one man. The suspects are each facing kidnapping charges and could face further charges for the weapon found in the car. Officers suspect that the kidnapping was in relation to prostitution. Officer Madison added: ‘Atlanta, from what i've been told, has the highest sex trafficking in the nation and our police chief makes sure we get training in how to search for that and look for that and fortunately, I was at the right place at the right time.’ The victim was taken to the hospital and is expected to be alright.","The woman was taken from a Motel 6 parking lot in Jonesboro, Georgia .

"PUBLISHED: 24 May 2012 . This is the shopaholic model who spends £1,000 a week on clothes - and says she cannot stop. Star Thompson, 19, has filled four wardrobes at her home in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, with clothes she has never worn. The teenager hates wearing the same outfit twice - to the point that she will bin socks after wearing them just once. Miss Thompson has a wardrobe stuffed with tops, leggings and shoes. She frequently buys underwear and has amassed more than 200 bras and 15 pairs of £250 Ugg boots. 'A lot of the clothes I do buy, I buy because I like them although I know that I won’t ever wear them,' she said. 'I’ve got to the point where I haven’t got anywhere to put it all and I’m doing three loads of washing each day just to keep it all clean.' Miss Thompson was given £6,000 on her birthday by her family, but she blew £4,000 in just hours, according to the Daily Star. She waded through the rest of her family's money in just days. She added: 'Sometimes I feel guilty because I could be saving or spending on something I actually need, but you only live once.' Retail therapy: Star Thompson is so addicted to buying clothes that she spent £4,000 in just a few hours on her birthday . Compulsive shopping (known as a shopping addiction), is a psychiatric disorder like all other behavioural addictions. Shopping addictions are socially reinforced, however, because consumerism is boosted by advertising, peer pressure and political encouragement to feed the economy. It has become more common in recent years, but was recognised as far back as the early nineteenth century. As with all addictions, shopping becomes the person’s main way of coping with stress, to the point where they continue to shop excessively even when it is clearly having a negative impact on other areas of their life. Finances and relationships are damaged, yet the shopping addict feels unable to stop or even control their spending.

"Yahoo and Microsoft have both revealed plans to create their own TV shows in the ever-expanding battle for the living room. Yahoo has unveiled plans for four shows, while Microsoft is believed to have 12 in development. They will go up against Amazon, Hulu and Netflix, all of whom are also commissioning their own shows in a bid to change they way we watch TV. Scroll down for video . Yahoo chief executive Marissa Mayer has unveiled plans to break into television-style original video with the launch of two original comedy series and an internet channel that will stream live concerts. The expansion makes Yahoo the latest technology company to mount a challenge to Netflix . Amazon last week unveiled a $99 TV box to take on Apple, Google and Roku - and it doubles as a games console. At an event in New York the firm launched the Fire TV box, which runs a special version of Google's Android software. The small box fits under a TV, and comes with a remote with a built in microphone for voice recognition. It allows users to download films and TV shows, along with apps. To play games, users can use a remote, or buy a separate game controller for $40. Mike Frazzini from Amazon Games said each game will be priced like a phone app, costing on average $2. Games available at launch will include Minecraft, driving game Asphalt 8 and first person shooter Sev Zero, created by the games studio double Helix Microsoft bought recently. Microsoft has signed up comedians Sarah Silverman and Seth Green for its projects. It hired former CBS boss Nancy Tellem to head up its new TV studio, which will produce shows to be watched on the firm's Xbox games console as well as its mobile devices. The studio now has six series lined up - including a science-fiction thriller called 'Humans' about humanoid robot workers - and more than a dozen projects in development, according to Bloomberg. Yahoo is seeking to order web series’ that will position it to compete with offerings from other streaming video goliaths in a bid to bolster advertising revenues. The web portal is set to order four new shows with per-episode budgets of as much as a couple million dollars, a source told the Wall Street Journal. CEO Marissa Meyer’s sweet spot appears to be half-hour comedies with 10 episode seasons ‘led by writers or directors with experience in television,’ the paper reported. Sagging revenues and four straight . quarterly losses have created a sense of urgency among executives . looking to have deals lined up before a major advertising conference . later this month. Actress Sarah Silverman is among those believed to have signed up to Microsoft's TV shows. It is believed the firm has six projects approved, with a dozen in development. ‘They want to blow it out big time,’ said the Journal’s source. Meyer believes the key to upping the advertising rate ante is adding television-caliber content to compete with the likes of Amazon, Hulu and Netflix, a person close to the negotiations explained. ‘They're looking at the same type of shows that Netflix and Amazon are eyeing,’ said the source. Having those shows lined up by the April 28th ‘NewFront’ event – in which internet companies pitch their advertising dollar worthiness similar to the way television networks present their primetime lineups – is key to that strategy. Yahoo is competing against an ever-increasing number of cable networks and other sites for the original content and viewers’ eyeballs, but is fixated on the potential premium advertising rates charged for video has for boosting the bottom line. Recent successes such as ‘House of . Cards’ and ‘Orange is the New Black’ helped drive a subscriber surge of . 2.3million in the fourth quarter of 2014 alone, the company announced earlier this year. Yahoo currently trails far behind other online video providers. Financial terms of Yahoo's deals to license the new series weren't disclosed. However, Yahoo doesn't plan to charge viewers to watch the series . Yahoo trails far behind other streaming providers, but it wants a piece of that pie, and the revenues that could be reaped through international syndication deals, according to the Journal. The ability to stream video from Amazon, HBO Go, Hulu and Netflix straight to televisions through Blu-ray players, game consoles, set-top boxes like Roku and other devices has no doubt fueled their growth, as has the ability use apps specially designed for handheld devices. Amazon Prime has also added multiple scripted and animated shows to its subscription-based Prime service, and only sweetened the deal with the recently-released Fire TV box meant to stream the content directly on to televisions. Vizio televisions currently use a Yahoo-based interface for apps, including direct video streaming competitors, to extend their usefulness – but it is not clear if the search giant would look to leverage that partnership. Also available is the Yahoo Sceeen app, which allows users the ability to watch Yahoo videos on Apple handheld devices. A Yahoo Screen website is also available for those interested. Yahoo declined to comment about it's video ambitions when reached by MailOnline. 'House of Cards': The Kevin Spacey-starring Netflix series has become the standard for online television shows . Yahoo is up against stiff competition without the ability to easily stream video content to televisions. Binge-watching has replaced appointment viewing, and web series have reached a level of critical acclaim with Kevin Spacey starring in ‘House of Cards.’ The site has produced original video series in the past, such as the Morgan Spurlock-directed ‘Failure Club’ reality show, and has also recently ramped up video production across its news and sports divisions. This is not an entirely new frontier. Recent moves to hire veteran journalists Katie Couric and David Pogue, as well as a rumoured $300million acquisition of video provider News Distribution network have also hinted at Yahoo’s ambitions. Meyer and chief marketing officer Kathy Savitt have reviewed more than 100 projects over the past few months, but are looking for shows that can hit the ground running, according to the Journal.","CEO Marissa Meyer is reportedly looking for four 30-minute, 10 episode comedies produced by television industry veterans .

"A man who has been evading capture in Florida after skipping out on bail 16 years ago has been caught in Panama and brought back to Miami by the U.S. Marshals service. Samuel Silva was arrested in April 1998 for driving under the influence after he crashed into a state trooper's car and nearly killed her when the gas tank exploded. 'When that violent crash happened, her gas tank exploded. The trooper (Marissa Sanders) was pinned under the vehicle,' Marshals Service spokesman Barry Golden told NBC Miami. In custody: Samuel Silva had to be transported to the U.S. by private jet after causing such a commotion on the commercial airliner that the Marshals Service planned to use . Now and then: Silva, now 46 (left), was first arrested in 2001 (right), three years after he caused an explosive accident that left a female state trooper with third degree burns . The station reports that after a lengthy investigation and ensuing search, Silva was brought into court and sentenced to almost nine and a half years behind bars. He appealed the verdict in May 2001 and was released on bond, but when that appeal was denied three years later, he failed to show up for the hearing, noting the start of his years on the run. The intelligence data collected by the Marshals office suggests that Silva, who is now 46, went to Puerto Rico in 2005 and lefty by August of that year. From then on, he traveled to various Spanish-speaking countries including Spain, the Dominican Republic, Mexico and Guatemala before ending up more permanently in Panama. In addition to his earlier charge of . DUI causing serious injury, Silva now faces two more charges of failure . to appear and unlawful flight to avoid prosecution, the latter of which . is classified as a federal charge. Silva attempted to put down roots in Panama in recent months, buying four properties and two cars in Panama City. Dangerous: Silva first evaded capture following this 1998 accident for three years . Moved around: Silva got a fake passport in Puerto Rico in 2005 and has traveled to a host of Spanish-speaking countries ever since, landing most recently in Panama and buying property there . It wasn't those purchases that tipped off investigators, however, as they kept their attention paid to the false passport he was issued in Puerto Rico in 2005 under a relative's name. Police in Panama assisted the Marshals Service in Silva's arrest, but he didn't go quietly: he caused such a commotion on the commercial airline on Friday while being transported by guards that they had to leave the plane and hire a private jet. The jet cost the federal government $30,000 and landed in Fort Lauderdale's executive airport on Monday. 'It doesn't matter how far you travel. It doesn't matter where you go. You can run. You can hide in a different country. The Marshals Service does not quit,' Mr Golden told area news station Local 10.","Samuel Silva crashed into a trooper's car on a Miami highway in 1998, nearly killing the officer when she was trapped below the gas tank .

"Zaha Hadid has said claims her plans for the new stadium resemble a vagina are 'really embarrassing' The female architect behind designs for the new Al-Wakrah sports stadium has said critics who compared her plans to female genitalia are 'really embarrassing.' Zaha Hadid has hit back against claims her designs for the stadium, which will host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, resemble a woman's private parts insisting they were inspired by an ancient dhow boat. Iraqi-born Hadid, who is considered one of the world's best female architects, also suggested the plans would not have faced the same criticism if they were designed by a man. 'It's really embarrassing they come up with nonsense stuff like this. 'What are they saying? Everything with a hole in it is a vagina? That's ridiculous,' she told Time. Hadid, who won the prestigious Pritzker . Architecture Prize in 2004 added 'if a guy had done this project' there . wouldn't have been the same level of criticism. The striking design is meant to resemble an ancient dhow boat that Qataris traditionally used for pearl diving. But when plans were released for a new 45,000-capacity stadium to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup the first reaction was something different entirely. Scroll down for video . Private parts: Designed by AECOM in association with Zaha Hadid Architects, the new 40,000-seat Al Wakrah Stadium is a proposed venue for matches during the 2022 FIFA World Cup Qatar . Inspired by the dhow boat that carried generations of local fishermen and pearl divers, the stadium weaves together Qatar's past with its progressive vision for the future . As Qatar unveiled the stunning blueprints for its new state-of-the-art climate-controlled Al-Wakrah sports stadium, design went viral. Thousands of fans posted tweets likening it to a woman's private parts - something that was almost certainly unintentional. The design, topped with a structure . resembling the sails of a dhow, is meant to tackle the Qatari searing heat and also includes a spectator area outside . the ground that will be temperature controlled at 30C to 32C. The . plan gave no specific details how the cooling system would work, other . than saying it would incorporate 'shading, aerodynamic and mechanical . cooling components'. The . question of the heat during a summer tournament has been a one of . several controversies since Qatar was announced as the winner of the bid . in December 2010. Players' union FIFPro has said it will urge its members not to take part if it . is played in Qatar's summer, even if air conditioning is installed in . the stadiums. Qatar's building projects have also been . hit by allegations of migrant construction workers not being given . enough food or water, as well as accusations of corruption over the . voting procedure to win the bid. Officials have denied the accusations. State-of-the-art: Sustainable materials and practices will be used throughout the stadium and the pitch and spectator stands will be cooled to a perfect temperature for football . Qatar's building projects have also been hit by allegations of migrant construction workers not being given enough food or water . The stadium, with a capacity of 40,000 people, is expected to be completed by 2018 . 'Al-Wakrah is the first of six stadiums already in the latter stages of the design process, our committee has issued 10 major tenders to the market encompassing project and design managers and stadium-operation consultants,' Hassan al-Thawadi, the general secretary of the 2022 committee told reporters. He said the stadium, with a capacity of 40,000 people, would be completed by 2018, but declined to comment on the cost. (File picture) A traditional dhow sails out of port. The stadium was meant to look like one of these . (File picture) The new stadium is being built 12 miles south of Doha for the 2022 World Cup . Overall, the tiny gas-rich state plans to spend about $140 billion on a rail system, a new airport, a seaport, and hundreds of kilometers of new roads for the tournament, in addition to the stadiums that will host the matches. Asked how the committee plans to limit any risk of abuse to workers, al-Thawadi said the committee was dedicated to applying all clauses in its workers' charter to make sure the rights of the workers were going to be respected and upheld. 'If there are any deaths above zero that would be unacceptable for us,' he said. The Al-Wakrah, which will be built 12 miles south of Doha, is not the only building to have been attracted attention for that reason. In Chicago the . Crain Communications Building, which was completed in 1983 with a . prominent vertical slit in the front, has been dubbed the Vagina .

"The ability of chimpanzees to communicate and use tools has fascinated scientists for years. And now they have witnessed how new behaviour is adopted and transmitted from individual to individual within a wild chimpanzee colony. It is the first time that experts have caught this behaviour on  camera in real-time and they say that the footage will shed light on how culture spread among early humans. Scroll down for video . Scientists have witnessed how new behaviour is adopted and transmitted from individual to individual within a wild chimpanzee colony. This image shows KB of the Sonso chimpanzee community of the Budongo Forest in Uganda, using a moss-sponge - a behavior she learned by observing her mother . The team studied the spread of two novel tool-uses among the Sonso chimpanzee community living in Uganda's Budongo Forest. 'Researchers have been fascinated for decades by the differences in behaviour between chimpanzee communities; some use tools some don't, some use different tools for the same job,' said Dr Catherine Hobaiter of the University of St Andrews in Scotland. 'These behavioural variations have been described as ""cultural"", which, in human terms would mean they spread when one individual learns from another; but in most cases they're long established and it's hard to know how they originally spread within a group. 'We were incredibly lucky to be in the right place at the right time to document the appearance and spread of two novel tool-use behaviours, something that is extraordinarily rare in the wild.' The results of the real-time discovery, described as 'extraordinarily rare', are published in the latest edition of the journal PLOS Biology. The analysis began when Nick, the 29-year-old alpha male chimpanzee, made a moss sponge while being watched by Nambi, a dominant adult female. Over the next six days a further seven individuals made and used moss sponges. Six of these had observed the behaviour before adopting it and the seventh was seen to re-use a discarded moss sponge so may have learned about the novel behaviour in this way. The scientists also recorded a 12-year-old sub-adult male retrieve and use a discarded leaf sponge. A further eight individuals adopted the re-use technique, but only four of them observed another individual re-using a sponge first. By using a technique called network-based diffusion analysis the researchers estimated that each time a 'naïve' chimpanzee observed moss-sponging, this individual was 15 times more likely to develop the behaviour. This striking effect contrasted with the re-use behaviour in which social learning played much less of a role. The researchers investigated the spread of new variations of 'leaf-sponges', which are tools dipped in water to drink from, commonly manufactured by the Sonso chimpanzees by folding leaves in their mouth. Different individuals were observed to develop two novel variants: moss-sponging (a sponge made of moss or a mixture of leaves and moss) and leaf-sponge re-use (using a sponge left behind on a previous visit). Neither moss-sponging nor leaf-sponge re-use had been previously observed in Sonso in over twenty years of continuous observation. Chimpanzees are widely considered to be the most 'cultural' of all non-human animals, but most studies examining how behaviour is transmitted are carried out in captive groups. This has long been a focus for critics of arguments for chimpanzee culture, who point out that without similar evidence from the wild it is difficult to argue for an evolutionary connection between human and chimpanzee 'culture'. But now, the researchers from the University of St Andrews, University of Neuchâtel, Anglia Ruskin University, and Université du Quebec, have proved how a new natural behaviour was passed from individual to individual in a wild community. The researchers investigated the spread of new variations of 'leaf-sponges', which are tools dipped in water to drink from, commonly manufactured by the Sonso chimpanzees by folding leaves in their mouth (pictured) Dr William Hoppitt, Senior Lecturer in Zoology at Anglia Ruskin University said: 'Our results provide strong evidence for social transmission along the chimpanzees' social network, demonstrating that wild chimpanzees learn novel tool-use from each other and support the claim that some of the observed behavioural diversity in wild chimpanzees should be interpreted as 'cultural'.' Dr Thibaud Gruber, Marie Curie Fellow at the University of Neuchâtel, said: 'This study tells us that chimpanzee culture changes over time, little by little, by building on previous knowledge found within the community. 'This is probably how our early ancestors' cultures also changed over time. 'In this respect, this is a great example of how studying chimpanzee culture can help us model the evolution of human culture. 'Nevertheless, something must have subsequently happened in our evolution that caused a qualitative shift in what we could transmit, rendering our culture much more complex than anything found in wild apes. 'Understanding this qualitative jump in our evolutionary history is what we need to investigate now.' Chimpanzees are widely considered to be the most 'cultural' of all non-human animals, but most studies examining how behaviour is transmitted are carried out in captive groups. This is the first time that learning has been filmed in real-time in the wild.

"A family has been forced out of their charred home after their 5-year-old son started a fire after playing with a lighter. Amoz Davis was in his bunk bed when he started playing with the lighter on Thursday night in northern Miami apartment.

Burned: The apartment in northern Miami was covered in soot and ash Friday morning after the fire the night before . Fire-starter: Amoz Davis, 5, was playing with a lighter when the blaze started . 'I had a fire and I light the bed up and then all the stuff get on fire,' he told NBC Miami on Friday morning.

"Texas Governor Rick Perry has caused a firestorm by comparing likening homosexuality to a disorder that people can avoid like alcoholism. The former Republican presidential candidate made the controversial remarks while speaking at a conference in San Francisco, and while most of the event focused on economic issues, an audience member asked about a new program in Texas that aims to 'cure' gay and lesbian clients. In response to a question about it, Perry said he did not know whether the therapy worked before he was further asked if he thought homosexuality was a disorder. Sparking controversy: Texan Governor Rick Perry made the remark during a Wednesday evening event in San Francisco . The San Francisco Chronicle says that the governor responded that 'whether or not you feel compelled to follow a particular lifestyle or not, you have the ability to decide not to do that.' He said: 'I may have the genetic coding that I'm inclined to be an alcoholic, but I have the desire not to do that, and I look at the homosexual issue the same way.' The paper added that while the event in famously-liberal San Francisco was packed with Republicans but there was even an audible mumbling immediately after the remark. This is not the first time he has drawn that comparison: he wrote in his 2008 book that while he is 'no expert on the 'nature versus nurture' debate, he argued that there were parallels between homosexuality and alcoholism. He went on to suggest that homosexuals should abstain from sex. The Texas Republican platform stand on the issue is in contrast to California and New Jersey, which have previously banned licensed professionals from providing such therapy to minors. Under fire: Former presidential hopeful Rick Perry compared homosexuality to alcoholism by suggesting that they are both something that can be cured (pictured Tuesday in California ahead of the Wednesday conference) Economic principles: Much of the Texan governor's trip to California was meant to focus on different economic initiatives, like the work being done at Tesla Motors . During the bulk of his talk, Perry held up his own state as a model for responsible energy production and economic growth in California. Perry said he believes Texas is leading the way in achieving energy independence by producing crude oil and electricity in many forms, including solar power. Perry also suggested that deregulating electricity had started a boom for renewable energy in Texas, which he called the nation's leading developer of wind energy. Perry said shale drilling techniques had doubled oil production in Texas, and he urged Californians to tap the full energy potential in its Monterey Shale. On Tuesday, Perry drove up to California's state capital of Sacramento in a Tesla Model S electric car — underscoring his desire to lure a Tesla battery factory to Texas.","The Texas Governor made the controversial remarks to an audience in San Francisco on Wednesday night .

"Pakistan's prime minister was jailed for around three minutes yesterday after he was convicted of contempt in a bizarre court case.

The case has stoked political tensions in the country and the ruling against Gilani appeared to be a compromise. But the case could still mean problems for Gilani because he has been convicted in a court. That means he could face dismissal from office in the weeks, or more likely, months to come.

The case against President Asif Ali Zardari, pictured here holding a picture of his late wife Benazir Bhutto, involves kickbacks he and Mrs Bhutto, a former prime minister, allegedly received from Swiss companies when she was in power in the 1990s . * Gilani was summoned before the Supreme Court on January 19 for failing to take steps to re-open money-laundering proceedings against President Asif Ali Zardari. He was indicted for contempt of court on February 13. * The civilian-judicial confrontation stems from thousands of cases thrown out in 2007 under an amnesty ordered by former military president Pervez Musharraf, which paved the way for a return to civilian rule. * Zardari was the decree's most prominent beneficiary. He became the main target of the court when it voided the measure in 2009 and ordered the government to ask Swiss authorities to restart legal action against him. * The cases date back to the 1990s, when Zardari had multiple cases of corruption lodged against him, including accusations of money laundering using Swiss accounts. He says all the cases are false and politically motivated. * Gilani and his advisers have defied the court, citing the president's constitutional immunity as head of state. The prime minister appealed the court's decision to charge him with contempt, but that appeal was dismissed in February. Elections are scheduled for later this year or early next, meaning it is quite possible the government could see out its term with Gilani still in charge. Gilani smiled when the verdict was read out in a packed court house. Gilani is the longest-serving prime minister in the history of Pakistan, where civilian governments have repeatedly been toppled by the country's powerful military, often with the support of the Supreme Court, which critics allege is heavily politicized. Corruption charges have routinely been used to target those in power, or seeking to return. The source of the current conflict is a graft case against President Zardari that involves kickbacks he and his late wife, former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, allegedly received from Swiss companies when Bhutto was in power in the 1990s. They were found guilty in absentia in a Swiss court in 2003. Zardari appealed, but Swiss prosecutors ended up dropping the case in 2008 after the Pakistani government approved an ordinance giving the president and others immunity from old corruption cases that many agreed were politically motivated. The Pakistani Supreme Court ruled the ordinance unconstitutional in 2009 and ordered the government to write a letter to Swiss authorities requesting they reopen the case against Zardari. Gilani has refused, saying the Pakistani constitution grants the president immunity from criminal prosecution while in office.","Yousuf Raza Gilani faces dismissal because of Supreme Court conviction .

"The U.S. government has spent $3million on eight inflatable boats that were intended to be used in Afghanistan but never once saw water. The landlocked nature of Afghanistan- not to mention the fact that they have been sitting in a Naval warehouse in Virginia ever since they were purchased in 2010- are two of the biggest reasons why they went unused. The U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction does not specify why the boats cost so much more than their American counterparts either. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Never made it over: Eight of these inflatable boats were ordered to deter smuggling along a river that separates Afghanistan and Uzbekistan but they were deemed unnecessary nine months after they were bought . The $3million price tag breaks down to $375,000 per boat, and The Washington Post reports that similar inflatable boats in the U.S. tend to cost about $50,000. 'We don't even have a list from (the Defense Department) of where they spent the money. We have no centralized list of where the taxpayer money went in Afghanistan,' special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction John F. Sopko told CBS. 'It's like you gave your credit card to your teenage daughter or son and then you just never looked at the bills.' The boats were originally intended to patrol the Amu Darya River that separates Afghanistan and Uzbekistan. Small section: Afghanistan is a landlocked nation but there is a strip of a river that separates it from Uzbekistan that, at one point, was considered necessary to patrol . Unanswered questions: Similar boats (like this one) reportedly cost about $50,000 but the ones the military ordered somehow cost $375,000 each . General Harold Greene told The Washington Post reports that they were intended 'to deter smuggling and illegal entry into Afghanistan' but they didn't see much action on that front. U.S. officials and NATO commanders deemed that the boats were not needed only nine months after they were bought without giving any specific reasons as to why, so the boats ended up staying in a warehouse in a Yorktown, Virginia naval base. 'The list of unanswered questions is particularly troubling given the fact... that this program had been an important national security priority for the Afghan National Security Forces prior to its cancellation,' Mr Sopko wrote in an official letter to military officials, which was then shared with The Washington Post. He expects the boats to be stripped for parts or 'sold for pennies on the dollar'. The boats are far from the only instance of an expensive budget item that went unused. Ghost town: A two-story facility in Helmand Province will now likely be demolished because American troops are being pulled out of the region, and it will be too expensive for the fledgling Afghan army to maintain . Seats to fill: The command and control facility at Camp Leatherneck in southern Afghanistan cost $34million . More than $600million was spent on specialized aircrafts that stayed on runways in Kabul and Germany. One of the clearest signs of waste, however, was highlighted in another SIGAR report last summer, where it detailed how $34million was spent on a state-of-the-art building on a base in southern Afghanistan that will never be used. The building was never be used by American troops but is too expensive for Afghan forces to maintain, so it will be levelled as a result. 'This is an example of what is wrong with military construction in general — once a project is started, it is very difficult to stop,' Mr Sopko wrote in a scathing report released last June. 'One senior U.S. military official told me that this facility was designed for a military division that was never deployed and, subsequently, a decision was made not to construct the facility, but inexplicably the building construction started and is now complete.'","Eight inflatable boats were ordered in 2010 but have stayed in a Viginia naval warehouse ever since .

"The Geneva offices of HSBC were raided by Swiss prosecutors yesterday in an investigation into alleged money laundering. Public prosecutors said they were searching for evidence of ‘aggravated money laundering’ after ‘the recent published revelations ’ about HSBC’s Swiss private bank. It is the latest damaging twist for the banking giant embroiled in a scandal over claims staff helped rich clients dodge tax. Under suspicion: Olivier Jornot, Prosecutor General of the Canton of Geneva, updates the media about the money-laundering investigation into HSBC's Swiss private bank after searching its offices in Geneva . The raid follows reports that HSBC also helped hide millions of dollars for arms dealers and blood diamond traders. It comes seven years after its former IT worker Herve Falciani fled Geneva with details of thousands of clients suspected of avoiding tax in their home countries, including 6,000 Britons. Although the Geneva prosecutor’s office said the probe was against the bank, it added that it could target individuals ‘suspected of committing or participating in acts of money laundering.’ Those found guilty could face a fine and up to five years in prison. Authorities in France, Belgium, the US and Argentina have already launched criminal inquiries. Gathering evidence: Attorney General Olivier Jornot (right) leaves the offices of HSBC's Swiss private bank . The investigation comes just over a week after HSBC Switzerland found itself at the centre of a massive global scandal following the publication of secret documents that claim to show it helped people avoid tax . In an unusual move, the Geneva prosecutor’s office alerted the media about the raid. This meant camera crews filmed attorney general Olivier Jornot and his staff arriving at HSBC’s offices overlooking Lake Geneva. Another raid was carried out on its office near the city’s airport. Mr Jornot said: ‘What we are looking for today is not yet proof. What we are looking for are all documents, all information which will then allow us to make an analysis.’ Mr Jornot added that Swiss law did not allow an investigation based on stolen evidence but his office could investigate if it secured the evidence itself. The raid comes more than a week after allegations emerged that HSBC’s Swiss private bank may have routinely helped wealthy clients dodge tax and hide assets. Files including the names of 30,000 account holders including celebrities, were leaked. They claimed huge sums were channelled through HSBC as customers dodged taxes or laundered proceeds of crime. Last week, a leaked memo revealed that HSBC was willing to help a ‘blood diamond’ trader even though he was being investigated for tax evasion. The term refers to uncut gems smuggled out of Africa and sold to fund brutal civil wars. HSBC said its private banking operation has been overhauled and accounts of suspect clients closed. A spokesman said: ‘We have co-operated continuously with the Swiss authorities since first becoming aware of the data theft in 2008.’ 'Decent': Clive Bannister . Former HSBC executive Clive Bannister – the son of four-minute-mile legend Sir Roger – could face questions from the Geneva public prosecutor. The 55-year-old spent 17 years at the bank and was the boss of its global private banking business from 1998 to 2006. Oxford-educated Mr Bannister, a father of three sons who is also a keen runner, was based in London. He was instrumental in turning the private bank into a global powerhouse with profits soaring to almost £1billion by 2007. HSBC’s Swiss private bank was a key part of his empire. Although there is no suggestion Mr Bannister was aware of any wrongdoing, the alleged misconduct occurred from 2005-2007, overlapping part of his service. Prosecutors may also choose to summon former trade minister Lord Green, who joined David Cameron’s government in 2011. He was the chief executive and then chairman of HSBC until stepping down in 2010 and sat on the board of the Swiss banking arm for a decade. Sources close to Mr Bannister describe him as a ‘incredibly decent man’ and point out he has not been interviewed during other investigations into HSBC in Belgium, France and the US. But the controversy has touched his current role as chief executive of insurance firm Phoenix Group as his chairman Sir Howard Davies has asked him to explain his role at HSBC. A cache of files stolen by former IT worker Herve Falciani (above) in 2007 claimed HSBC's Swiss private banking arm helped clients in more than 200 countries evade taxes on accounts containing $119 billion . HSBC were willing to help a 'blood diamond' smuggler even though they knew that he was being investigated over tax evasion, according to a leaked memo. The bank aided Emmanuel Shallop before he was convicted for his part in an illegal trade that fuelled war in Africa. According to one memo seen by the Guardian, one banker said: 'The client is currently being very careful because he is under pressure from the Belgian tax authorities who are investigating his activities in the field of diamond tax evasion.' HSBC bankers also helped him open a bank account in Dubai. Blood diamonds were rough, uncut gemstones, smuggled out of Africa and sold to fund civil wars. The main countries involved were Angola, Liberia, Sierra Leone, The Democratic Republic of Congo and the Ivory Coast. Emmanuel Shallop used his company Shallop Diamonds to trade conflict diamonds for Revolutionary United Front (RUF) leaders in Sierra Leone.","Investigators have searched Geneva offices of HSBC's Swiss private bank .

"Charged: Jennifer Cotten, 40, now faces aggravated assault, abuse and neglect, and bail violation charges in connection with Rebecca's death last Thursday . A malnourished young disabled woman who weighed only 40 pounds has died and her mother has been charged for having a role in her condition. Rebecca Cotten was 22-years-old and had been previously diagnosed with cerebral palsy. Her mother Jennifer Cotten, 40, now faces aggravated assault, abuse and neglect, and bail violation charges in connection with Rebecca's death last Thursday. Local Memphis station WREG reports . that authorities had been previously alerted to the alleged abuse that . the mother inflicted on her daughter when Jennifer was ordered to stay . away from Rebecca after the young woman was found in a hot car. At the time of that August 2013 incident, . Rebecca weighed 55 pounds and was five feet tall and was tested to have . traces of methamphetamine in her system. Police were called to the . scene when there were reports that people- including Jennifer- were . doing drugs in a nearby home. When police arrived, they found Rebecca in . the car with the engine off and the windows rolled up all the way. Jennifer's . brother then took Rebecca to his house after the incident and told the . station that his mother, Rebecca's grandmother, took care of the girl . before her death. Malnourished: Rebecca Cotten, pictured, was severely neglected but her mother's live-in boyfriend claims that she did her best for the girl, even though she is now facing multiple abuse charges . Questions: Relatives do not know how the young woman's condition got so drastic, and she was unable to communicate making the investigation process even more difficult when police got involved last year . Rebecca's condition is so drastic that she was completely unable to communicate, so family members and investigators do not know how her health deteriorated so dramatically. WREG spoke to Jennifer's unidentified brother at that point, after a meeting with Department of Children's services, and the mother reportedly said that there was an explanation- but her relatives contradicted her statements. 'She told them she has a eating disorder and when she eats, she spits up and she spits the food back out and doesn’t consume it, which has not happened since we’ve had her,' Jennifer's brother told the station. At some point, John returned Rebecca to her mother's care- which Jennifer's boyfriend said was because he couldn't handle the demands of an individual with special needs- and the situation did not improve. Neglect: Rebecca was about 5-feet tall and 22 years old but only weighed what a toddler normally weighs . It . is unclear exactly when Rebecca's uncle John brought her back to her . mother, but both Jennifer and Rebecca were injured in a house fire in . early May- just weeks before Rebecca was found dead. Jennifer took Rebecca to a house in the Berclair neighborhood of Memphis where there was no electricity and she left her there for an unreported reason. Police responded to that scene when there was a fire and both Jennifer and Rebecca were inside. They both had to be treated for burns sustained in the fire. Neither Jennifer nor her brother, who was only identified by ABC using his first name, have spoken publicly since Rebecca's death last week, but Jennifer's longtime boyfriend has said that she was doing the best she could and she should not be blamed. 'Jennifer's the only one who ever cared for that child or done anything. She's the only one who would,' William King told WREG. Defending his girlfriend: William King said that Jennifer did the best she could and was the only one who cared about Rebecca . 'Nobody wants to change the diaper of a 22-year-old kid. Feed her. Nobody wants that!' He went on to claim that while John did take care of Rebecca after the August arrest, it did not last long and he quickly returned the young woman to her mother because he could not handle the constant care she needed. 'They tried to give the kid to everybody- nobody wanted her! nobody!' Mr King said. 'The police wouldn't even do anything about it. They said ""Nobody wants her, what can we do?"" Now y'all are going to lock people up for trying to take care of a child. 'Single mother raised three kids on her own and worked with disabled children all her life- why was she on her own? This was a terrible accident to happen.","Rebecca Cotten, 22, was severely malnourished and unable to communicate due to her disability .

"A teenage girl's dream to pay homage to her idol Marilyn Monroe with a tattoo of her has ended in a nightmare - after the finished artwork looked like a 'blow up sex doll'. Siobhan Fields, 16, paid £50 for the image of Marilyn to be inked on her left arm but said the end result was simply a 'monstrosity'. The heartbroken hairdresser said tattooist Dave Stewart - who does not have a council licence to operate - originally agreed to refund her money but then blocked her on Facebook. Some like it botched: Siobhan Fields, 16, is appalled with the result of her Marilyn Monroe 'artwork' she received from Daves Intenze Tattoos . The teenager says it's going to cost an estimated £300 to cover up the tattoo . She has now reported him to police and today warned other potential victims to steer clear of the tattoo artist. Siobhan, of Burnbank, Hamilton, . Scotland, said: 'It's horrible. It's so embarrassing. I've had to go out . and buy loads of long-sleeved shirts because I don't want anyone to see . it. 'I love Marilyn Monroe. She was absolutely beautiful - but this tattoo makes her look more like a blow-up doll. 'Her mouth is just a black blob, the eyes are circles, her eyes are two dots. 'She has black hair, the eyebrows are all wrong and there are wobbly lines everywhere.' Siobhan's ordeal began after she found Dave's 'Intenze Tattoos' on Facebook and - impressed by the artwork on display - booked a session. She said: 'Alarm bells should have started ringing when he said he would do it round at my house. 'I showed him to the picture of Marilyn and he seemed very confident that he could match it. 'I booked an appointment and during the session I didn't look at my arm because I'm not good with pain so I was just closing my eyes and gritted my teeth. 'When it was finished, after about 90 minutes, I looked in the mirror and just felt total shock. But he was quite an intimidating guy, with tattoos all over his face so I didn't want to confront him at the time. 'Then I felt that I had just paid £50 for this guy to basically disfigure me for life. 'Later on I contacted him and asked if he could refund my money and at first he agreed but then he blocked me on Facebook and cut off all contact. 'It's just one sorry looking mess and now I have to live with it. Distraught Siobhan says tattoo artist Dave Stewart (pictured left and tattooing the teenager) originally agreed to refund her money but then blocked her on Facebook . 'It's going to cost around £300 to have it covered up by a proper tattoo artist.' Mr Stewart was unreachable for comment today. The Facebook page for Dave's Intenze Tattoos has been taken down. A spokesman for South Lanarkshire Council said: 'Intenze Tattoos does not hold a licence within the South Lanarkshire Council area. 'The Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 (Licensing of Skin Piercing and Tattooing) Order 2006 gives Local Authorities the power to license individuals who carry out skin piercing or tattooing activities as a business. An example of a tattoo done by Daves Intenze Tattoos on a Facebook awareness site set up by Siobhan Fields' mother Cheryl, after her daughter had a tattoo of Marilyn Monroe . Siobhan has now reported him to police and has set up a group of examples of Mr Stewart's work to warn others to steer clear of the tattoo artist . Siobhan says that customers should be careful about having tattoos done by the artist, and has posted photos that she says are examples of his work . Siobhan has posted photos of examples of the tattoo artist's work to Facebook, and says she has reported him to police . 'The Order lays out a number of requirements aimed at reducing, if not removing, risks to public health from these practices. 'As well as setting out criteria that operators must adhere to, the Act also prohibits the tattooing of people under the age of 18 years and restricts the activity of skin piercing on people under the age of 16 years unless accompanied by a person with parental rights. 'A person carrying out the activity of skin piercing or tattooing without a licence shall be guilty of an offence and liable, on summary conviction, to a fine.' A Strathclyde Police spokesman said: 'We would urge anyone considering body art, including tattooing, to thoroughly check the artist's credentials. 'Artists operate under a local authority-granted licence which should be displayed.' Other celebrities to have Marilyn Monroe tattoos inked on them include I'm A Celebrity... contestant Helen Flanagan and Megan Fox - but the star has undergone surgery to remove the 'negative character' from her arm.","Teenager estimates it will take £300 to cover up 'monstrosity'

And Ronaldo would add a penalty in . the last minute after he had been tripped in the box to give the . score-line an entirely unmerited gloss. Yet it was Bale’s goal which . finally broke Atletico Madrid. How . Real were made to work for those milestones; how close they came to . failure. Atleti had led 1-0 with three minutes of added time played when . Sergio Ramos’ header cruelly denied them a triumph, an almost exact . re-run of how they lost this trophy against Bayern Munich in 1974. In . the end it was all too much. Their extraordinary coach, Diego Simeone . invaded the pitch before the end to protest, bringing a red card for the . Argentine. It was a seemly end to a brave fight for this team . constructed at half the cost of Bale’s price tag. For . while recognising the achievement of Real Madrid – and in the end . their sheer willpower and determination not to lose prevailed – it was . impossible not to recognise the enormity of Atletico Madrid’s . achievement.

Five . minutes of injury time were indicated and Simeone was already furious, . the first sign of the imminent breakdown. Three minutes into that added . time came a corner from Luka Modric. It was well delivered but the leap . of Sergio Ramos and the ferocity of his header was something to behold.  It fairly flew into the bottom corner and a good two thirds of the . stadium erupted as the Real Madrid bench sprinted to join in the . celebrations.

With Simeone cajoling, encouraging them every step of . the way from the touchline, they proved thoroughly disruptive with Gabi, . Koke and Raul Garcia terrier-like in midfield. Real . were slowly constructing some coherent football, there best chance . coming on 32 minutes from a characteristic burst from Bale after a . mis-placed Tiago pass.

Atleti’s . retort came four minutes later. A Gabi corner was headed away on 36 . minutes and then returned by the head of Juanfran, looping into the . penalty area. There was little danger until Iker Casillas, the . 33-year-old came sprinting off his line in a panic.

Gutted: Atletico's Portuguese midfielder Tiago is left devastated by the result . Job done: Ancelotti celebrates after his Real Madrid team won their 10th European crown . As . he did, Uruguayan Diego Godin, who will soon take on England, rose . above the Real defence to divert the ball over the unfortunate . goalkeeper. Despairing Casillas was already retreating, realising his . error; he even got a hand to the ball, but to no avail. It was over the . line and a manic Godin was off on a celebratory run that would end under . a mass of Atletico players. Real . would strive for an equaliser. A Ronaldo free kick was deflected onto . the bar on 54 minutes; his header glanced wide on 62 minutes; Bale . simply sprinted past Godin on 78 minutes but shot tamely into the side . netting.

"Friends reveal that Bowe Bergdahl was discharged from the Coast Guard on account of a failed psychological exam two years before he enlisted in the Army and shipped off to Afghanistan. Bergdahl sent a box containing his laptop and personal journals to a friend in Idaho shortly before he walked off the Army base in Afghanistan in 2009 and she has shared the concerning writings with The Washington Post. Some of the more bizarre excerpts feature his rantings about the wisdom of the protagonist in Ayn Rand's novel Atlas Shrugged, his desire to learn Russian and 'Chines' and how he wanted to write a story about someone 'going-crazy-to wander the earth alone'. 'I’m worried... The closer I get to ship day, the calmer the voices are. I’m reverting. I’m getting colder. My feelings are being flushed with the frozen logic and the training, all the unfeeling cold judgment of the darkness,' he wrote in one entry shortly before his deployment. Release: Bowe Bergdahl was exchanged for five detained Taliban leaders and now a friend has revealed that he failed a psychological examination in 2006, two years before he enlisted in the Army . Frequent misspellings and repeated references to voices inside his head are seen throughout the entries in a notebook and in various files on his computer. 'These thoughts insist on trying to overwhelm my mind... I’ve spent a lot of my life thinking blackness was all I had in front of me, that it would be blackness to the very last instent [sic]. I know this is not right. I know that there is light in this darkness, and that I can actuly [sic] reach it if I keep walking, keep moving to it.' 'Like i’m pulling away from the human world, but getting closer to people... Almost as if its not the people I hate, but society’s ideas and reality that hold them,' he wrote in a document called 'threw the mind'. 'I want to change so much and all the time, but then my mind just locks down, as if there was some one else in my mind shutting the door in my face... I want to pull my mind out and drop kick it into a deep gorge.' Bergdahl, who was promoted to Sargeant during his five years in captivity, reportedly had a little-known history with the uniformed services before he enlisted. Friends were shocked when the introspective teen, who took ballet and fencing lessons near his home in Idaho, told them that he wanted to join the Coast Guard. Uncharacteristic: Bergdahl's friend from home in Idaho said that he does not look like his normal self in footage of the exchange . He was close with Kim Harrison, who ran the center where he took the recreational classes, and she was the one who drove him to take the Coast Guard exam even though she had initially told him about her reservations about the idea. She was the one who Bergdahl later listed as his emergency contact in the Army who he designated should be sent his remains if he was killed in combat. 'These thoughts insist on trying to overwhelm my mind... I’ve spent a lot of my life thinking blackness was all I had in front of me, that it would be blackness to the very last instent [sic]. I know this is not right. I know that there is light in this darkness, and that I can actuly [sic] reach it if I keep walking, keep moving to it.' -Bowe Bergdahl, written in a journal he sent to a friend shortly before walking off an Army base in Afghanistan . She was also the one who he sent his box filled with his writings, as well as a copy of the libertarian favorite Atlas Shrugged and a pile of military records, which she has since shared with The Washington Post. Ms Harrison, who spoke using her maiden name to avoid threats, said that she shared the information because she was concerned about the portrayal of Bergdahl as a cold, calculated deserter as opposed to how she viewed him: as a vulnerable young man with emotional issues. His writings, which poetic longings to see the world and become a story teller to unexplainable repetitions of bizarre phrases, give the clearest picture to date of his mental state but the revelation of his history in the Coast Guard shows that there were external warning signs that were overlooked by the government. The Washington Post checked Coast Guard records which show that Bergdahl left as a result of an 'uncharacterized discharge' following just 26 days of basic training. Bergdahl reportedly told Ms Harrison and other friends that he had faked the exam but they did not believe him. 'He said he started to feign a psychological disorder, saying strange things to get out. I remember flat out calling him out on it— I said ""there is something else going on."" He said, ""I chose to do it,""' an unidentified friend told The Post. He announced that he had enlisted in the Army two years later. Normally the Army requires a waiver to be filed noting that they have approved the enrollment of individuals who have previously been discharged. One unidentified military official claimed that the Army was aware that Bergdahl had received an 'administrative discharge' in the past when he enlisted. Inner thoughts: Bergdahl sent a box filled with his Apple computer, journal, military files and copy of an Ayn Rand book to a friend in Idaho and it arrived to her just days after he walked off the base . The Army could not immediately confirm or deny the issuance of a waiver. He wrote about his feelings both before he left his Army training program in Georgia and while he was on the base in eastern Afghanistan. 'Really, how pathetic i feel as i listen to people talk of the hell I will be heading to,' he wrote in a document saved on his computer under the file name 'my army memories'. 'Compared to hell of the real wars of the past, we are nothing but camping boy scots. Hiding from children behind our heavy armored trucks and our c-wire and sand bagged operating post, we tell our selves that we are not cowards.' One of his last known communications came a few weeks before he left the base on June 30, 2009. He emailed Kim Harrison's daughter Kayla, who he had been close with, and told her not to worry if her mother 'gets a call from red cross' at any time in the future. 'You know what I do, and ash I am still perfecting, actions may become . . . odd. No red flags. Im good. But plans have begun to form, no time line yet. . . love you! Bowe,' he wrote. Kayla was concerned and emailed back asking about the plans, and he replied in code: 'l1nes n0 t g00 d h3rE tell u when 1 ha ve a si coure 1ine about pl/-\ns'. 'There is still time yet for thinking,' he wrote the next day. When she wrote back telling him not to 'do anything stupid or pointless,' he said 'you know I plan better then that'.","Close friend of Bowe Bergdahl has shared the journals and writings on his laptop that he sent to her shortly before walking off the Army base .

"Only four companies have signed on to base their operations in the World Trade Center as the majority of the world's most expensive office building remains available for rent. Magazine publishing company Conde Nast are the largest tenants, having claimed 24 floors starting on the 20th floor. The China Center, a company that provides office space for Chinese businesses, has signed on for floors 64 through 69. A hospitality management company, Legends Hospitality, has purchased 100,000 square feet on the 100th, 101st, and 102nd floors which includes the observation deck. Mashable reports . that the final interested party is the General Services Administration, . a federal agency, who has claimed six floors starting on the 50th floor . as their new base of operations. Scroll down for video . Scores of empty floors: The majority of the World Trade Center remains unallocated . That means that approximately 39 of the 104 floors occupied and 65 unclaimed. This week's earlier report that the owners have slashed office rents nearly 10 per cent comes as little surprise then. The Wall Street Journal  reported that rents have been cut to $69 a square foot for larger tenants on the building's middle floors. Developer Douglas Durst says that is down from $75 a square foot. 'The market's not there,' Mr Durst told The Wall Street Journal. He bought a stake in the 1,776-foot tower from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in 2011. 'When we started in 2011, everybody expected the economy to take off, and obviously that hasn't happened.' All told, the construction of the 1,776-foot building cost $3.9billion . Major tenants in the building include magazine publisher Conde Nast and the government's General Services Administration. The skyscraper, the nation's tallest building, is scheduled to open later this year. Filling the floors: The developer has cut the asking rent for the middle floors of the World Trade Center from $75-per-foot to $69-per-foot . Competition: Rent in some of the middle floors of the World Trade Center have been knocked to $69-per-foot but neighboring buildings cost closer to $53-per-foot so that makes it tough for businesses to swallow . 'We have a lot of people looking at the space, but because of the asking rent, we are not able to really put anything over the finish line,' Mr Durst told The Journal. Part of the problem is that while there is a great deal of interest in real estate downtown- with Time Inc and the Bank of New York Mellon Corp. among the list of companies looking to move their operations south- the neighboring buildings are able to charge far cheaper rental rates. For instance, average downtown office rents were $53.87 in the first three months of this year, making the 1 World Trade Center rates more difficult to accept.","Less than half of the office space in the building is rented out .

"Expelled: Lewis McLeod was expelled following an investigation into an alleged sexual assault but he never was subject to a criminal investigation . A soccer player who was expelled from Duke University because he was accused of sexually assaulting another student is now suing the school to get his diploma. Lewis McLeod was accused of sexually assaulting a female student in November and though the school expelled him after conducting his own investigation, the case was never pursued by law enforcement and he never faced criminal charges. McLeod, who is Australian and in North Carolina on a student visa, has filed a lawsuit saying that without the diploma that he was originally due to receive earlier this month, his life is being put on a detrimental hold. Local station WRAL reports that the lawsuit claims that the 'sloppy investigation' and 'violated Duke University's own written standards... as well as all notions of fundamental fairness'. If the expulsion is not overturned, McLeod will lose his student status and be forced to return to Australia. If he does not receive the degree, he will also lose a conditional job offer at an unspecified Wall Street firm. Scene: McLeod says that the sex he had at his home (pictured) with the young woman he met at a bar in November 2013 was consensual but she claims she was assaulted . 'Inability to actually assume employment . in this prestigious position is substantially certain to negatively . impact him forevermore,' his lawyers wrote. The alleged sexual assault took place . on November 14 when McLeod, who played on the school's soccer team, . brought a young woman home from a local Durham, North Carolina bar. They . proceeded to have sex, and though he claims it was consensual, the . unidentified young woman 'got emotional' and started crying. On the team: Because of his student visa status, McLeod will be forced to return to Australia . She later contacted the local police and the school's police force. Duke's Office of Student Conduct conducted an investigation though it remains unclear why the local police did not pursue any charges. 'Throughout the hearing, members of the panel and the Office of Student Conduct made decisions that prevented Mr. McLeod from presenting his side of the story, denied him his right to respond to allegations against him and denied him his right to a fair and impartial hearing,' his attorneys wrote. Duke University has a very public history of controversy surrounding sexual assault charges. In 2006, three lacrosse players were accused of raping a stripper who had been hired to perform at a party. The scandal and subsequent trial became a national news story but the accuser was found to have fabricated the story. The three young men have filed lawsuits against the city, and one of their lawyers is representing McLeod in his case. 'I think it's terribly unfair to impact an accused student's life, future career, even the pursuit of their degree at this level,' attorney Kerry Sutton told WRAL. 'I'm not saying rape doesn't happen. I know it happens. It's a horrific offense,"" but she asserted that the judgement and punishment should be handed out by law enforcement and not universities.","Lewis McLeod, an Australian who was on the soccer team at Duke, is suing the school to get his diploma .

"Her side of the story: Maria Di Toro, now 31, has opened up for the first time about how she claims she was raped by Greg Kelly in 2011, though no charges were ever filed . The woman who accused a prominent New York news anchor of rape has spoken out for the first time after the alleged 2011 attack. Maria Di Toro accused Greg Kelly, who was known for his role as a local Fox News anchor and the son of the then-police commissioner Ray Kelly, of rape but the district attorney’s office refused to prosecute citing a lack of evidence. As soon as it became clear that charges were not going to be filed, her name was released publicly but an exclusive new interview with Buzzfeed that was published Monday marked the first time that she or her longtime boyfriend had ever spoken about the ordeal. ‘I was really scared into submission,' Ms Di Toro told Buzzfeed. ‘I’ve gotten to a point in my life where I realize that I didn’t do all that I could have done to stand up for myself… I was always like a puny little thing, but I always stood up for myself… And I didn’t this time. And it’s eaten away at my core every day.’ The alleged assault took place in early October 2011. According to Ms Di Toro, she met Kelly on the street and approached him to say that he looked better in person than he did on television. At this point in time, she was a 29-year-old paralegal and had been dating her then-48-year-old boyfriend for three years. When she happened to meet Kelly, who was also in a relationship, he asked for her number and they began a texting exchange that went from ‘casual, G-rated stuff’ to ‘casual, trusting, and consensually explicit’. At one point, they spoke by phone while she was at her law office about what their favorite sexual positions. They agreed to get drinks on Saturday October 8 at a bar in the South Street Seaport called Jeremy’s Ale House, and Kelly paid for the first round of drinks before she returned the favor with both the second and third rounds. She told the police, and more recently Buzzfeed, that after only two sips of the third drink, she became strongly impaired and she can only remember the rest of the afternoon in snippets. They walked back to her law office, and she remembered a flashback of being pushed up against a building and kissed by Kelly. Then she remembers being on the floor in her office and seeing him bare-chested on top of her. He allegedly told her to ‘get up, get up, get up’ at one point and she could not move. Accused: Greg Kelly is a co-anchor for Good Day New York on the local Fox affiliate and the district attorney chose to never charge him in the case. He maintained his innocence throughout . Backlash: The day after the district attorney announced that they would not be pressing charges, The New York Post- which is owned by the same company that owns the network where Kelly is a co-anchor- revealed her identity and put her on the front page . She also says that he was later sitting and looking at his phone as he asked her if she was on the pill- which she was not because her boyfriend, Francis Laros, had had a vasectomy. She spent the rest of the weekend refusing to talk to her relatives about what happened and feeling nauseous. She eventually told her boyfriend and her twin sister, and they both came to the conclusion that Kelly had raped her. On Monday, Kelly called her and talked to her about how drunk they had been on Saturday- after only two full drinks- and when he asked if she had a good time, she said she could not remember. He then filled in the details, allegedly reliving graphic details and telling specifics about their alleged sexual encounter. He concluded the call by asking if she wanted to ‘f*** again’ and she said that she ‘croaked out “Yeah, sure.”’ They never met in person again. She spoke to him again two days later and told her that her boyfriend had found out and that her life ‘had been turned upside down’. She aked him if there was any possibility she could be pregnant from their encounter and he reportedly said no, and when she asked if he had put something in her drink, he allegedly said that he did not like what she was implying. ‘I wasn’t accusing him of anything, but I couldn’t believe I got that drunk off only two drinks and couldn’t remember the whole evening, not even remember the hours later and how I got home,’ she wrote in an official statement to the district attorney. Video Source MyFoxNY.com . Connections: Kelly is also the son of Ray Kelly (right), who was the longtime New York Police Department commissioner at the time of the alleged October 2011 incident . Their conversation ended with Kelly reportedly saying that he would call her in a month ‘when things cooled down’ but that never happened- and tensions only continued to mount when she realized two weeks later that she was pregnant. Both she and her boyfriend had tried getting in touch with Kelly- with her boyfriend even saying something to his father, Ray Kelly, when he happened to pass him on the street just days after the alleged rape. Greg Kelly never responded to any of their texts or voicemails. Ms Di Toro sought council from nuns at a mission on the Upper East Side who agreed that she had been raped, and she determined that she would get an abortion, which a letter from a Manhattan doctor confirmed on November 12. It was not until January 24, 2012 that Ms Di Toro reported the incident to police, and considering three months had passed after the alleged rape, there was no tangible evidence that they could use against Kelly in any court of law, but she had known that from the beginning, citing knowledge gleaned from reports of other rapes and Law and Order: SVU. She explained to Buzzfeed that it took time for her to conceptualize the fact that she had been raped, not to mention the time that she needed to decide to come forward with the support of her boyfriend, who has stayed by her side throughout. ‘All I kept thinking for those three months is that if my niece came up to me and told me what happened to me happened to her, I would want to kill the man and make sure she got justice,’ she said. Support: Di Toro, who is now 31, has stayed with her boyfriend Francis Laros (right) who she was dating at the time that she went to meet up with Kelly . That was not the case for Ms Di Toro, however, as the chief of the district attorney’s sex crimes unit released a letter saying that no charges would be filed against Kelly because ‘the facts established during our investigation do not fit the definitions of sexual assault crimes under New York criminal law. Therefore, no criminal charges are appropriate’. ‘Because of that letter, the press was able to say, “Here’s physical proof that what she’s saying is a lie.” Because of that letter, the press got a free pass to tell me, along with the rest of the world, that what happened to me didn’t happen to me. Because of that stupid letter, they’re saying I was not raped,’ Ms Di Toro told Buzzfeed. Kelly’s station, Fox5, is owned by the same parent company as the New York Post which led the local coverage of the accusations, using quotes from unidentified colleagues who said that he was a nice guy who they could never imagine involved in such a situation. Two days after the letter from the district attorney’s office was released, the Post ran a picture of Di Toro wearing a large sunhat that they took from her Facebook account as the front page with the headline ‘Shady Lady’. ‘I thought that was one of the most personal things they could have ever done. They didn’t kill my mother or anything, but they came pretty damn close to it. It felt like being violated a second time, third time, fourth time,’ she said of the coverage. After taking a leave of absence following the initial onset of the investigation, Kelly returned to the morning news the day after the ‘Shady Lady’ cover and thanked his fans for staying by him after a ‘tough couple of weeks’. Kelly, now 45, remains one of the Good Day New York co-anchors. In a statement released after the district attorney’s letter, he said he was ‘thankful that the investigation established what I’ve known all along, that I am innocent of the allegations that were waged against me. I am so blessed to have a wonderful family and friends whose support for me never wavered.’","Maria Di Toro accused Fox News Good Day New York co-anchor Greg Kelly of rape in October 2011 .

"The United States government has denied Edward Snowden's claims that he was an undercover spy and had worked for both the CIA and NSA. National Security Adviser Susan Rice has spoken out in the wake of Snowden's first televised interview that aired on NBC Wednesday night. When asked if Snowden's claim was true, Ms Rice bluntly said: 'No'. 'Edward Snowden was a contractor working for the NSA and other elements of the intelligence community,' she said to CNN's Wolf Blitzer after being prompted with another question. His side: Edward Snowden told NBC's Brian Williams that he previously worked as an undercover operative for the CIA and the NSA, but the government has since denied those claims . 'Obviously he’s accused of sharing and disclosing, illegally, some of the most sensitive information of the United States government, allegedly, and our strong view is that rather than give television interviews, he ought to come home and have his day in court where he will be treated with all of the protections and fairness that our judicial system allows.' Speaking out: Susan Rice told CNN that Snowden never served in such capacities and he should come back to America to be brought to court . Her comments come after Brian William's full interview with Snowden aired, wherein he claimed to have had experience working as a government-backed undercover agent in addition to working later as an analyst and contractor for the NSA. 'I was trained as a spy in terms of the traditional sense of the word in that I lived and worked undercover, overseas, pretending to work in a job that I'm not, and even being assigned a name that was not mine,' he said to NBC. 'Now the government might deny these things, they might frame it in certain ways and say ""Oh, well he's a low-level analyst"" but what they're trying to do is they're trying to use one position that I've had in a career here or there to distract from the totality of my experience, which is that I've worked for the Central Intelligence Agency- undercover, overseas. I've worked for the National Security Agency- undercover, overseas- and I've worked at the Department of Defense as a lecturer at the joint-training  academy where I developed sources and methods for keeping our people and information secure in the most hostile and dangerous environments across the world.' He went on to claim that before he turned over the documents to journalist Glenn Greenwald, he started to go through official channels to report his apparent concern over the NSA's surveillance programs. More evidence: Snowden said that he sent emails to his higher ups at the NSA before leaking, expressing his concerns, but the government took the unprecedented step on Thursday of releasing one email that went against his comments . In response, the government used their new Intelligence Community Tumblr to released one email that they had on file from Snowden. The email is dated April 8, 2013, and seems to be an inquiry about the definition of the scope of executive orders as dictated in part of his training. 'NSA has now explained that they have found one email inquiry by Edward Snowden to the Office of General Counsel asking for an explanation of some material that was in a training course he had just completed,' the IC On The Record Tumblr caption notes. 'The e-mail did not raise allegations or concerns about wrongdoing or abuse, but posed a legal question that the Office of General Counsel addressed.' Edward Snowden's email, dated Friday, April 5, 2013 . Hello, I have a question regarding the mandatory USSID 18 training. The training states the following: ----(U) The Hierarchy of Governing Authorities and Documents is displayed from the highest authority to the lowest authority as follows:U.S. ConstitutionFederal Statutes/Presidential Executive Orders (EO)Department of Defense (DoD) and Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) RegulationsNSA/CSS Directives and Policies      USSIDs      SID Management Directives and Policies      Office Policies----I'm not entirely certain, but this does not seem correct, as it seems to imply Executive Orders have the same precedence as law. My understanding is that EOs may be superceded by federal statute, but EOs may not override statute. Am I incorrect in this? Between EOs and laws, which have precedence?Similarly, between DOD and ODNI regulations, which has greater precedence? Could you please clarify?Thank you very much, Ed . Official response, sender's name redacted, sent on Monday April 8, 2013Hello Ed,Executive Orders (E.O.s) have the ""force and effect of law."" That said, you are correct that E.O.s cannot override a statute.In general, DOD and ODNI regulations are afforded similar precedence though subject matter or date could result in one having precedence over another. Please give me a call if you would like to discuss further. Regards, [name redacted]Office of General Counsel . Full exchange: This email chain was released by a government-run blog on Thursday afternoon in an effort to discredit Snowden's claims that he sent emails showing he was concerned about NSA policies .","Snowden claimed that he worked for the CIA, NSA and Department of Defense at different points in his career .

"Tottenham can finally press on with plans to build a £400 million stadium after a High Court judge ruled they can force out the one business blocking their way. Archway Sheet Metal Works were fighting a compulsory purchase order making them give up their land for Spurs to build a new 56,000-seat ground next to White Hart Lane. The company has 21 days to appeal but Mr Justice Dove told them they have no reasonable chance of success. Tottenham have the go-ahead for their new 56,000-plus capacity stadium at White Hart Lane . Archway Sheet Metal Works, which is located next to White Hart Lane on the last patch of land Tottenham needed for their stadium development argued that the compulsory purchase order was unlawful . How Tottenham's new stadium will look for night games from 2018-19 season onwards . It is anticipated that once work starts on the new stadium it will take three years to complete. The news will give Tottenham supporters an extra lift before tomorrow's London derby against West Ham. Sam Allardyce, the West Ham manager, has stoked the flames by claiming he could have succeeded where Spurs have failed this season by getting Emmanuel Adebayor (right) scoring again. Allardyce tried to end Adebayor's nightmare at White Hart Lane by taking him to Upton Park on loan last month. Sam Allarydce has goaded Spurs fans after saying he could have got the best out of Emmanuel Adebayor . The misfiring Tottenham striker has scored just two goals in 15 games so far this season . The striker was close to a deadline day move only for Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy to veto the deal. Since then, Adebayor has not made even one of manager Mauricio Pochettino's match squads. In 12 Spurs games this year Adebayor has started just once and been on the bench three times — playing just 115 minutes. Allardyce, who has lost striker Andy Carroll for the rest of the campaign with a knee injury, instead brought in 33-year-old Brazilian Nene on a free transfer. Now Big Sam is convinced he could have got the best of Adebayor. Allardyce said: 'He is one of those players that you have to look at and say, 'How do I react to him and interact with him (because) that is the basis for how well he plays for us?' 'You use your management skills in terms of looking at his personality and talking about wanting him to enjoy his football and do what he does best: play and score goals.'

"Here's the latest plaything for the super-rich - a giant three-hulled yacht that cost £15million to make and would fit as comfortably in outer space as it would on the open sea. Described by Boat International magazine as 'one of the world's most amazing super yachts', the 42.5metre-long Adastra is a floating pleasure palace equipped to entertain a billionaire with even the highest of standards. She is the the new pet of Hong Kong-based shipping magnate Anto Marden, 64, and his wife Elaine, whose uses for her may include - among other things - gliding between the two tropical islands they already own off the coast of Indonesia. Scroll down for video . The giant Adastra is a three-hulled made-to-order yacht that cost $15million to make . The yacht has been described by Boat International as 'one of the world's most amazing super yachts, that could spell the future for efficient long range cruising' Futuristic: The main deck area looks more like that on a spaceship than a boat . The main helm station, which has seating for two, is positioned in a raised pilot house situated between the rear deck and the saloon area and forms part of the cross beam structure . Very little is known about billionaire shipping magnate Anto Marden, the boss of Fenwick Shipping Services, and his wife Elaine. Mr Marden, 64, is known as a very experienced yachtsman who has spent his life on the high seas for his business and now flitting between islands in the far east and south-east Asia. He was educated at the expensive Charterhouse School Godalming in Surrey before graduating from the University of Leeds. Designed by Sussex-based yacht designer John Shuttleworth, the Adastra is so high-tech, it can even be controlled remotely at the touch of an iPad... as long as you don't get any further away than 50 metres. The yacht's high-concept, space-age look is no gimmick. The shape has . been specially developed to cut through waves as it glides across the high seas. Adastra was unveiled in China and took three years to build, as well as two years of planning and design. It is 42.5 metres long, 16 metres wide and weighs 52 . tons. Her enormous petrol tank coupled with her dynamic sailing efficiency allows the Adastra to travel up to 4,000 miles without refuelling - the same distance from London to New York. ‘It takes the power trimaran concept further than has ever been . attempted before,’ Mr Shuttleworth told Boat International. ‘The challenge of turning this . concept into a viable luxury yacht has taken us to further research and . to develop new thinking on stability and comfort at sea for this type of . craft.’ It is the result of five years of planning and construction, and rivals anything owned by yacht-lover Roman Abramovich. The hull of the Adastra is built from glass and Kevlar and can house nine guests and six crewmen. The deck saloon has a panoramic view while the open cockpit has sofas on both sides. The open deck running aft also . has a door that hinges . out to create a bathing platform. Boat International magazine said Adastra 'could spell the future for efficient long range cruising'. The yacht has an integrated ship monitoring system, and . can even be controlled with an Apple iPad within a 50-metre range. Adastra is powered by one Caterpillar C18 engine of 1150hp . at 2300 rpm and has 2 Yanmar 110hp @ 3200 rpm outrigger engines. Adastra's 16-metre beam features a saloon area on the main . deck with a lounge area, dining table, and navigation station. The deck at the rear of the yacht has a sofa and bar area to . port and a dining area to starboard. Great unveiling: The Adastra during its grand launch in China yesterday . Lavish: The master bedroom has all the luxury you might expect in a 5-star hotel . Opulent: The bathroom is complete with power shower and a flushing toilet, left,  while the galley has fresh running water, a stove and all one could want in a kitchen, left . Shiny: As the designs show, the boat has a bathing platform at the back where passengers relax as the it glides effortlessly across the open sea . The main helm station, which has seating for two, is . positioned in a raised pilot house situated between the rear deck and the saloon . area and forms part of the cross beam structure. The Adastra is the latest in a long line of super yachts that compete to be the most high tech. Last year Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich bought a £300 million superyacht with two swimming pools, two helipads, a gym, hair salon, dancefloor and submarine. Eclipse has plenty of room to entertain friends, . with 15 double bedroom cabins all equipped with their own luxury . bathrooms and 6ft wide television screens. Parties on the 533ft yacht . are guaranteed to stay private, as it’s fitted with an ‘anti-paparazzi . shield’ that fires a laser beam of light at cameras to ruin photographs. The 20,000 sq ft interior also houses a sauna, steam bath and whirlpool to help guests wind down.

Blueprints: It was designed by Sussex-based yacht designer John Shuttleworth, a world-renowned boat architect . Early stages: The shape has been specially developed to cut through waves as it glides across the high seas . New build: It is the result of five years of planning and construction, and rivals anything owned by yacht-lover Roman Abramovich . The designers say Adastra is the result of meticulous attention to detail and innovative design . The Adastra can house up nine guests, in addition to six crew members, and travel at a speed of up to 22.5 knots . The boat is fuel efficient, too, able to make it 4,000 miles - longer than a trip from London to New York - without stopping for gas . Into the sunset: The yacht has an integrated ship monitoring system, and can even be controlled with an Apple iPad within a 50-metre range . According to Shuttleworth's website, the yacht's hull is made of glass and Kevlar, while the interior consists of lightweight oak cabinetry using honeycomb panels. To reduce weight, everything on the boat was custom made . The yacht has an integrated ship monitoring system, and can even be controlled with an Apple iPad within a 50-metre range . The style of the Adastra has been described as 'futuristic' by some and akin to an 'alien attack vessel' by others . The boat was built in China for the Hong Kong-based couple and recently launched . The designers said: 'We have undertaken state of the art structural analysis of all the major components in the yacht in order to achieve the light weight required for very low fuel consumption' The slender hulls and streamlined exterior allow her to travel faster in the open ocean and at 17 knots she has a 4,000 mile range so can comfortably cross both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans at hi-speed . Extensive tank testing and radio controlled model tests in waves have been carried out to analyse stability and performance .

"If you think your commute is a living hell, then spare a thought for these subway passengers in Tokyo. Packed like sardines into sweaty, claustrophobic carriages, these passengers can barely breathe let alone move about freely. The photographs are the work of Michael Wolf, a German-born artist who has been capturing the cramped conditions of Japanese capital's transport network for 15 years. Scroll down for video . No breathing space: Michael Wolf's 'Tokyo Compression' photographs capture the cramped misery of the morning commute in the Japanese capital. The German-born photographer has spent 15 years documenting the overcrowded and sweaty conditions on a subway network used daily by 11 million people . What a squeeze! These passengers don't have an inch in which to move and are pressed up against the steamy glass windows. The one on the left stares out of the carriage, while the one on the right seeks solace in music . Tokyo is world famous for its urban density and so the public transport nightmare is hardly surprising. And despite being squeezed and stretched every day, it's the dignified way the commuters cope with the depressing daily grind that Wolf's pictures bring out. He has just released a third volume of pictures in his portfolio 'Tokyo Compression' which has been published in a book by Peperoni Books and Asia One Books. Standing on the platform as the doors snap shut, Wolf has been able to capture a whole range of expressions from his unwilling and trapped subjects. Some stare disconcertingly at the lens, others close their eyes to try and escape the brutal overcrowding, while others have their faces contorted against the steamy glass windows. Sardines: Wolf has been taking pictures of the Tokyo morning rush hour for 15 years, working Monday to Friday between 7.30 and 8.45am at the same subway station . Forty winks: Many passengers close their eyes to try and think about something other than the crush, Wolf found, while the man on the left gives out a yawn which suggests he may need a bit more sleep . Going head to head: You never know who you will be squeezing up against on the Tokyo Subway. Many frequent commuters have worked out their own personal methods of winning some space, taking advantage of anything they may have to hand - umbrellas, bags and briefcases - to make room . Wolf first experienced the Japanese subway network when reporting on the aftermath of the sarin nerve gas attack which killed 16 people and injured 6,000 in 1995. His collection of images quickly grew into a portfolio first exhibited in 2008. 'I shot six frames of faces of early morning commuters in subway windows which turned out to be very powerful images,' said Wolf to Landscape Stories of his work. 'I spent 20 days [Monday to Friday] every morning from 7.30 until 8.45 at the same subway station shooting portraits of people on their way to work.' 'The images create a sense of discomfort as his victims attempt to squirm out of view or simply close their eyes, wishing the photographer to go away,' reads the description on Wolf's website. 'Tokyo Compression depicts an urban hell and by hunting down these commuters with his camera, Wolf highlights the complete vulnerability of the city at its most extreme.' Ghostly: Some of the commuters take on a hauntingly pale complexion, giving the impression they are hopelessly trapped on their journey . Push button to exit: The trains are packed to capacity between first light and late morning in Tokyo, with the carriages appearing fit to burst as they arrive into the stations. White-gloved 'oshiya' or pushers have been employed on the network since 1955 to forcibly shove passengers into the carriages . Eleven million commuters use Tokyo's transport network every morning, with suburban and subway trains reliably packed to the brim from first light to late morning. It is a sign that Tokyo's tsukin jigoku [commuting hell] has grown steadily out of hand that the railway companies have employed white-gloved oshiya (pushers) to shove passengers into carriages since 1955. Regular commuters have become deft at performing what is known as the Tokyo pirouette, which allows them to slide into the carriage and then stand without having to make eye contact with those who have moved aside. Scuffles between frustrated commuters have become more and more common, while notorious chikan [subway molesters] take advantage of the overcrowding to fondle fellow passengers. Passengers are well trained in using whatever they have on them - bags, briefcases and umbrellas, for example - to fight for space. Police have reported a massive rise in 'commuter incidents' - injuries and assaults. Cheek to cheek: Being squashed against the glass of a subway train is a common occurrence in Tokyo, where as many as 11 million people use the creaking network to get to and from work every day . Chin up: In situations like this, all you can do is try and keep your spirits up. Wolf was surprised by the dignity and stoicism of the passengers, despite the ever-worsening transport nightmare .","Series of pictures by Michael Wolf, entitled 'Tokyo Compression' document the misery of the morning commute in the Japanese capital .

"Posing in a feminine lace dress with flawless make-up, Cara Delevingne is the picture of professionalism in the new Mulberry campaign. But the behind the scenes video, which the fashion giant has just released, shows the Cara that the world fell in love with, in all her kooky glory. The 21-year-old, who kicked off 2014 as the star of Mulberry's SS14 campaign, can be seen fondling a tortoise, posing with a horse and pulling a series of her trademark goofy faces in the new short film. Goofball! Cara Delevingne, whose kooky personality skyrocketed her to fame, is her usual goofy self in Mulberry's SS14 behind-the-scenes campaign video .

Cara appears to have found a new best friend in the form of a tortoise . Work mode: Cara is ever the professional as she poses as the face of Mulberry for the second season . Speaking about the campaign, art director Cooke Newhouse said: 'The spring 2014 campaign was a beautiful but naughty tea party with Cara and her ark of animals - the perfect Mulberry moment. 'They didn’t have the best table manners, but Cara was very forgiving.' Cara, who is well known for her love of animals, even poses with a parrot on her shoulder in one of the shots. Furry friends: Cara, 21, proves that she is ever the professional as she poses with a parrot on her shoulder in the SS14 campaign . What a tasty finger you have, Cara: Behind the scenes, Cara can't resist playing with her parrot friend . A spokesperson for Mulberry said: 'I don’t think I have ever been on a shoot with so much talent in the room…and I am not talking about our animal friends! 'Tim Walker’s vision gives a romantic, literary and very British feel to the Mulberry brand and Cara has more spirit, true beauty and warmth than you could ever hope for: charisma with a capital C!'

As well as being an iconic brand, the products are sexy and cool.' And it seems that Cara is keen to follow in the footsteps of fellow clothes horse Alexa Chung, who had a Mulberry satchel named after her. 'My favourite Mulberry bag would be the Cara bag…actually that hasn’t been made yet! I want to design a Mulberry bag, there needs to be a Cara bag. 'I have so many ideas, Mulberry need to call me. And they have to let me design trainers too!', she added. The next Alexa? Like Miss Chung, Cara has revealed that she wants to design her own handbag for the brand . It has been a busy few months for fashion's favourite face. Aside from her modelling duties, she is currently filming Michael Winterbottom's film The Face Of An Angel in Italy. She took some much-needed time off over Chiristmas to holiday with her family in Barbados before flying to New York to ring in the New Year with her good friend Rihanna.

"Detectives are reporting a massive rise in the number of reported child abuse linked to witchcraft, they said today. Scotland Yard has received 27 allegations of ritual child abuse this year alone - a dramatic increase on a decade ago, when just two such cases were reported to police in the whole of 2004. Examples of the faith-based abuse include a child being dunked in a bath to 'wash away evil spirits', children being raped, and a pastor swinging a child around banging its head to 'drive out the devil'. Now teachers, social workers and doctors are to be taught to spot the signs of the abuse in a drive to tackle the growing problem across Britain. Police say witchcraft-based child abuse is on the rise - this shows an alleged exorcism ceremony in a suburban street in south London last month . Last month police were called to a leisure centre in south London after residents reported a string of dawn 'child exorcisms' in which adults surrounded a toddler chanting 'Get the demon out'. A number of child killings have been linked to these beliefs, including the murder of Kristy Bamu, 15, who was tortured and drowned by his sister and her boyfriend in 2010; and the death of Victoria Climbie. The number of cases of ritualistic or faith-based abuse of children reported to Scotland Yard has increased year-on-year over the past decade.  But detectives believe the number of reports is just the tip of the iceberg, with many more such cases being kept secret among communities. Police and child protection experts have now created a training film for all front-line professionals who work with children to teach them how to recognise the signs that a child may be suffering, or likely to suffer harm from witchcraft. The DVD will be launched at a conference on the subject in London today, organised by the Met police and the Churches' Child Protection Advisory Service (CCPAS), before being distributed to those in the force area who work with children who may be affected. Detective Superintendent Terry Sharpe, head of the Met's Project Violet which tackles faith-based child abuse, said: 'Abuse linked to belief is a horrific crime which is condemned by people of all cultures, communities and faiths. 'Families or carers genuinely believe that the victim has been completely taken over by the devil or an evil spirit, which is often supported by someone who within the community has portrayed themselves as an authority on faith and belief.' This alleged exorcism ceremony, performed on the street in south London, did not involve children but police say child abuse linked to faith-based rituals is on the rise and professionals must learn to recognise the signs . 'But regardless of the beliefs of the abusers, child abuse is child abuse and it is important that professional are clear about the signs to look for.' At the event at City Hall, detectives will debate with teachers, social workers and healthcare professionals to discuss how to tackle what is now a growing problem in Britain. In 2004 just two such cases were reported to Scotland Yard.  By 2009 it had risen to seven, and by 2012 it had risen again to 19. Among this year's 27 reports of such abuse, cases included a child forced to drink unknown substances to 'rid them of evil spirits' and parents removing their children from school and taking them abroad to attend an 'exorcism' ceremony. One case has already resulted in an arrest for rape, and another in a charge of rape being brought. Previous cases dealt with by Scotland Yard include a child having chillies rubbed into its eyes to 'remove an evil spirit' and being cut with a knife for the same reason. Extreme cases have seen children killed as a result of these rituals. In 2000 Victoria Climbié, an eight year old originally from the Côte d'Ivoire who lived in Haringey, north London, was tortured and murdered by her guardians who believed she was possessed by an evil spirit. The belief, which was supported by their church leaders, led to her being beaten, burned with cigarettes, and forced to sleep in a bin liner in a bath before she was killed. Victoria Climbié, eight, and Kristy Bamu, 15, were murdered by relatives who thought they were possessed . Victoria's aunt and adoptive mother, Marie Therese Kouao, then 44, and her boyfriend Carl Manning, 28, were both sentenced to life imprisonment for Victoria's murder. In 2010, 15-year-old Kristy Bamu was tortured and beaten before he drowned in a bath at his sister's flat in east London after his sister and her boyfriend became convinced he was possessed by 'kindoki', or witchcraft, and was trying to harm or control another child in the family. Magalie Bamu, then 29, and her partner Eric Bikubi, 28, were jailed for life in 2012 after they were convicted of Kristy's murder. And in 2001, the torso of a young boy, named Adam by police, was found floating in the Thames.  It is believed he may have been the victim of a ritual sacrifice practised in parts of Africa. Simon Bass from the Churches' Child Protection Advisory Service said: 'We are not remotely surprised that the Metropolitan Police alone has already received 27 referrals of this type this year - or three a month. 'We are pleased that the Metropolitan Police has undertaken such great work in this area, but we are convinced that this form of abuse is hidden, and that the statutory agencies across the UK are facing similar situations.' Abuse survivor Kevani Kanda said: 'Mass migration has made this a pervasive problem worldwide, and it is not confined to cities or areas where there are large migrant communities. 'Belief-related abuse can result in significant physical and emotional harm, neglect, sexual abuse and even death.'","Metropolitan Police have 27 reports of witchcraft-based child abuse this year .

"A Florida-based former Christian missionary was today sentenced to 58 years in federal prison for sexually abusing girls who were part of an indigenous tribe in the Amazon and filming the acts. While he was establishing a church with the Katukina tribe, Warren Scott Kennell, 45, a missionary with the Sanford-based New Tribes Mission, befriended the girls and abused them over several years, prosecutors said. He was arrested in Orlando in May and investigators found more than 940 images of child pornography on his hard drive. Convicted creep: Warren Kennell, a Florida-based former Christian missionary, pictured, was sentenced Tuesday to 58 years in federal prison for sexually abusing girls who were part of an indigenous tribe in the Amazon and filming the acts . On Tuesday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Tanya Davis Wilson said Kennell abused his position as a missionary 'in the most horrendous way.' Homeland Security Investigations began investigating Kennell after they got a tip that he'd posted pictures on a website that allowed people to trade child pornography, according to the Orlando Sentinel. Agents stopped him at Orlando airport after he got off a plane from Brazil and discovered several thumb drives and an external hard drive on his person during a search. The drives contained hundreds of images of child pornography. Kennell admitted he was the man . abusing a young girl in one of the images and said he was responsible . for photographing the second girl. Missionary: Kennell abused his position as a missionary for Sanford-based New Tribes Mission, pictured, which is one of the largest Christian missionary organizations in the world . After his arrest, he pleaded guilty to two counts of production of child pornography and during his sentencing Tuesday, Kennell apologized to the victims and his family. 'I've hurt a lot of people,' he said. His father, Joe Kennell, asked the court for leniency, listing off some of the positive things the missionary has done throughout his life. Joe Kennell, who was also a missionary and, with his wife, raised their children in Brazil, told the court his son often provided medical care to the locals. New Tribes Mission is one of the largest Christian missionary organizations in the world. In 2011, the Sanford-based group was sued by a woman who claimed she was raped repeatedly from age 8 while she lived in a dormitory for missionary children in the Philippines.","While he was setting up a church with the Katukina tribe in Brazil, Warren Scott Kennell, 45, befriended the girls and abused them over several years .

"Caroline Kennedy's recent attempt to stop her mother's letters from being auctioned off is just her latest effort to stop others from profiting off her family's legacy. Caroline, who is the sole surviving member of former President Kennedy's direct family, stopped a batch of letters that her mother sent to an Irish priest from being sold at auction last month on the grounds that she has inherited her mother's copyright and therefore owns the letters that were sent to Father Joseph Leonard. 'The family got fed up of everybody making money off of the Kennedys,' author Laurence Leamer, who wrote a book called The Kennedy Women, told The Boston Globe. Not for sale: A set of letters Jackie Kennedy wrote to a Catholic priest in Ireland have been pulled from auction after All Hallows College received complaints from the former first lady's family . 'They want the control. They want the money. . . . They’re very protective, and they feel these repulsive journalists are trying to say anything to make a buck. That’s not totally untrue.' Now more details have been revealed about how she was able to put an end to the sale, which would have helped a local college stay afloat during tough financial times. The specific contents of the letters have been kept under wraps but they were sent from Jackie over the span of 15 years following the first time she met Father Joseph Leonard during a trip to Dublin in 1950. In the 33 newly-discovered handwritten letters, amounting to some 130 pages, the famously tight-lipped Mrs Kennedy writes freely of her suspicions about JFK’s fidelity, her reservations over his frightening ambition and her utter loneliness and anger at his tragic death. Father Leonard worked at All Hallows College in Dublin, and the cash-strapped college found the letters in his belongings that he had gifted to the school when he died. Fast friends: Jackie first met Father Joseph Leonard on a trip to Dublin in 1950. He chaperoned her during the trip, taking her to the theatre and out to the city's finest French restaurant . More roles: Caroline Kennedy serves as the protector of her family's legacy but she also is now the American ambassador to Japan, seen here at an event in Tokyo last week with actor George Takei and the Prime Minister's wife Akie Abe . In correspondence before and after she joined her husband in the White House, she admitted the rising political star was consumed by ambition ‘like Macbeth’. Writing in 1953 — the year they married — she said that politicians were ‘a breed apart’ but admitted that she too was vulnerable to their craving for attention. Because the sale has been cancelled, the school will not receive the windfall from the auction which was expected to net about $4million, and they have been forced to close after 172 years. The sale raised legal question of ownership, however, because even if the letters themselves were the property of the priest, who then passed that property on to the school, he never legally had the copyright to the material in the letters. That copyright is generally believed to belong to the author themselves, which would be Jackie Kennedy in this case. When she died in 1994, her will mandated that the copyright to all of her writings would fall in the hands of her two children. 'I request, but do not direct, my children to respect my wish for privacy,' her will stated. Longstanding friendship: Father Leonard and Jackie, pictured in 1950 during their initial meeting, corresponded faithfully over the course of 15 years . When John Jr died in 1999, Caroline was given control of both of their estates. In the latest drama surrounding the end of the Irish auction, the sellers did not immediately announce who put an end to the sale, saying only that members of the Kennedy family complained. Now The Boston Globe has revealed that Kennedy family attorneys contacted Sheppard's Irish Auction House on May 21 saying that the sale could not go forward on the grounds that they own the copyright. 'It’s Caroline’s decision about what should happen... Whatever she would suggest I would agree to,' Jackie's stepbrother Hugh D. Auchincloss told The Globe. Caroline, who is now serving as the American ambassador to Japan, has taken a hands-on role in the release of her mother's private thoughts. The clearest example comes when an oral history Mrs Kennedy made was first not going to be released until 75 years after her death, but then Caroline surrepticiously released a book in 2011  detailing the transcriptions.","The sale of 130 pages of letters written by the former first lady to Father Joseph Leonard was called off after the Kennedy family intervened .
Lawyers for the family contacted the Irish auction house and argued that Caroline owns the copyright to the letters .
The letters themselves technically belonged to the priest, who gifted his belongings after his death to All Hallows College, where he taught .
But because Jackie Kennedy wrote the words in the letters, that falls under her copyright which is now controlled by her daughter Caroline .
All Hallows College was hoping to make about $4million from the sale which would have kept them open but now the school is shutting down ."
"It utilizes the vertical take off and landing of a helicopter and couples it with the off road driving capabilities of a truck. And, what's even better, is that this robotic warrior is remote controlled. Introducing Black Night Transformer, a specially made truck that comes complete with eight rotors - four on each side - that will spring out for take off and then fold in while driving. The machine was built as part of a U.S. military desire for a 'multi-mission medical and casualty evacuation unmanned air vehicle/unmanned ground vehicle', according to Pop Science. Scroll down to video . The U.S. military commissioned the creation of a vehicle that can drive and fly remotely so it can be sent on missions unmanned . The Black Knight Transformer features eight rotors that expand when necessary and fold away while on the ground . Creators Advanced Tactics tested the transformer's flight earlier this year . Essentially it meets the need of an autombile that can adapt to a variety of situations. An American government study on medical evacuation concluded that the use of robots in military missions will allow for casualty evacuations in areas and times that manned platforms should not operate in, such as 'zero-zero' weather and contaminated environments. Once the Black Knight reaches its target, its also possible for the controls to be switched and for it to be driven by a human. Overall, it reduces the risks involved with many missions. The Black Knight is also designed for cargo delivery. As per its design, the Black Night Transformer is able to shrink down its helicopter engines so that it is more drivable . Test: A prototype takes flight during initial testings . Tests were carried out in February to see whether the Black Knight Transformer could be used by the U.S. military in the future . This artist's impression by the developer Advanced Tactics showed what they intended the AT Transformer to look like . Advanced Tactics, an El Segundo-based firm, plans to test a remotely operated, transforming, flying, driving evacuation vehicle early this year . 'The U.S. Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory is interested in using the Black Knight vehicle for unmanned cargo resupply missions,' Advanced Tactics chief engineer Rustom Jehangir tells Popular Science. 'They've done work on this in the past with other platforms, such as the Lockheed Martin K-Max, but our platform will be much less expensive.' The driving components were tested in late 2013, while the flying aspects will be tested before the end of February. The Black Knight Transformer would allow the military to enter and exit dangerous areas without having to send in soldiers . In November, it was reported that U.S. soldiers in combat had made a request for drones that could be launched by hand. It prompted the Pentago to commission three-dozen micro-drones that resemble birds. Prioria Robotics of Florida announced at the time the US Army Rapid Equipping Force, or REF, awarded them $4.5 million in federal contracts to deliver to the Department of Defense 36 models of the company’s Maveric unmanned aerial vehicle by December. Each Maveric can soar through the sky at speeds up to 55 knots and has the ability to offer soldiers an array of advantageous features. Each aircraft weighs roughly two-and-a-half pounds, and according to the Army News Service, the Maveric’s flexible wings help enable the UAV to blend into its surroundings. In November, the Pentagon ordered 36 drones known as 'Mavericks' that could be hand launched and were fitted with cameras for reconnaissance missions . Almost there: The truck-mounted laser weapons the army hope will prove to be a game-changer on the battlefield . Then in December, the Army successfully tested a futuristic laser weapon capable of shooting football-sized mortar rounds. The truck-mounted weapon, known as the High Energy Laser Mobile Demonstrator (HEL MD), gives a hint at what a weapon of the future could look like. Using an invisible laser beam to exact targets, the rounds are capable of taking down drones from the sky and even missiles. In November, the Pentagon ordered 36 drones known as 'Mavericks' that could be hand launched and were fitted with cameras for reconnaissance missions . During tests, a 'quarter-sized' invisible laser beam successfully targeted and destroyed more than 90 incoming mortar rounds and six to seven unmanned drones. Terry Bauer, the project manager for the laser program, told ABC News the test results were 'above and beyond' what they had expected going into the testing. 'We had no thoughts that this 10-kilowatt would be as successful n doing that as it has been,' he said. Mortars are common battlefield weapons that are hard to protect against because they can be fired from short distances. The mortars used in the test were standard 60 millimeter rounds – the length of a football — fired from a distance of less than two kilometers in salvos of two to three mortar rounds each. The laser’s success rate against incoming mortar shells indicates that battlefield protection from the small explosive rounds could be possible in a few years.","New drone is in development to meet the requirements of the U.S. military for a new evacuation vehicle .

"A bloodied drug addict falls into a stupor as he injects a bags-worth of potent Mexican heroin into his foot. Disturbing as it may be, this is an all-too-familiar sight on Chicago's West Side. The addict, named Rico, is just one of hundreds of the city's homeless population in the grip of the city's heroin 'epidemic'. Heroin addicts Ozzy, left, and John prepare their morning hit in a car park in Chicago, Illinois. The city's homeless often fall prey to heroin addiction . Left pic: Greg, left, with a syringe in his hand and his partner Stacey, right. Right pic: The 'cooking' tools of a junkie who has fallen into a stupor after getting their fix . And not all of them have grown up in inner city slums, as you might expect. There has has been a rise in the number of 'suburban addicts' ending up on the streets too. The problem has been blamed on Mexican cartels flooding the streets with, what local and national government officials say, is some of the highest purity heroin there has ever been. This haunting project - titled Poison Brown - is the work of photographer Chuck Jines, 47, who has spent almost a year documenting the plight of Chicago's addicts. His images show the squalid conditions in which they live - in cardboard boxes, under bridges and car parks - and how they will do anything to get their next fix. Mr Jines, who started shooting documentary projects in 2008, said he was shocked by the level of drug abuse he found.

Rico, a long-term drug addict, lies back after injecting heroin into his feet. Photographer Chuck Jines said he feels a personal connection to all of his subjects . 'It's truly remarkable how the city revealed itself to me,' he said. 'Heroin is everywhere. It's as if one day a mysterious veil was suddenly lifted and I was shown a world that dwells just beneath the surface. 'The whole experience has made me more grateful for what I have and who I am.' Heroin abuse is believed to be dropping in the UK but is rising in the US, where there are thought to be half a million addicts. In Chicago's West Side, where open-air drug markets operate, a bag of heroin can cost as little as $10 (£6) and a typical addict uses up to 20 bags a day. Mr Jines's photographic project began in June 2013 as a follow-up to another project about a group of homeless people he called the 'Alley Boys'. Rico is one of dozen of heroin addicts Chuck Jines has followed and built a friendship with as part of his photography project . Young men being searched by an officer under the suspicion of drug dealing in Chicago. Mr Jines thinks drugs should be decriminalised . After being released by the Chicago Police, this individual was seen displaying his earnings for the camera . Chicago's west side is stricken by severe poverty, both a consequence of and reason for its spiralling drug problem . Through his connections he was able to start meeting and photographing heroin addicts and their world. He said: 'I've developed a reputation on the streets over the years for being an authentic person. I'm straight-up and I show people respect. 'I started out by focusing on one addict named Kevin. From there I began to develop relationships with several other addicts. 'It takes a lot of waiting. It can be hard to catch people ""home"". Often addicts are in and out of jail, so the story is continually on delay. 'The worst part of this was watching people destroy themselves, sleeping in s***, sticking dirty needles into their abscess-speckled bodies.' He added: 'Today I have addicts who approach me because they've heard of me and want to be part of the story.

Ozzy, a heroin addict, prepares to for a hit in a bathroom block. Chicago's drug addicts are coming from all walks of life, both inner-city slums and the outer suburbs . 'Generally the people in my photos are folks that I've come to actually like as people. If I don't like someone, I don't invest in the relationship. 'Like in most social strata, there are both good and bad people in the heroin world. I see some who are truly haunted by their addictions and have a true desire to quit - but I also know addicts who maintain that they literally love their addiction to heroin. 'A lot of them are dead. If the heroin doesn't get them, hepatitis or the streets themselves will get them. You don't see many old heroin addicts out here.' Mr Jines, who has 'not for a millisecond' been tempted to try heroin, says his view on heroin use and the 'War on Drugs' has changed over the last year. He now believes heroin needs to be decriminalised to stop it spreading across the country. This comes in spite of the high-profile arrest in Mexico of Joaquin 'Shorty' Guzman, the alleged head of the Sinaloa Cartel, who last year was described as 'Chicago's Public Enemy Number One'. Stacey, a drug addict, shows an infection developing in track marks on her elbow. Disease is rife and a constant danger for the homeless addicts . An addict preparing himself for injection. The conditions in which many of these people live are horrendous . 'I advocate for a three-pronged approach: prevention, harm reduction, and treatment,' Chuck said. 'In every culture and society there will always be a certain percentage of the population that become addicted to drugs such as heroin. 'The situation becomes inflated through the War On Drugs which has created an atmosphere of crime, mass imprisonment and unnecessary death. 'The drug cartels make money, the dealers make money, the government makes money and private enterprise makes money. 'Legalising the use and sale of drugs deflates the whole situation by removing the money incentive.' Mr Jines, who is married and lives on the outskirts of Chicago, is now documenting the gang culture that thrives in Chicago's West Side and plans to publish a book of his work in the next year. Heroin addicts can consume up to 20 bags of the drug every day and will do whatever they can in between to get the money to pay for it .

"Daisy Fellowes tried to seduce a married Winston Churchill and when that failed, wed his cousin. She lived on a diet of morphine and grouse, and the occasional cocktail. Pictured above in 1934 . She was rich, ugly, dissolute and ‘the destroyer of many a happy home’ as one ex-lover bitterly put it. She did her best to seduce a married Winston Churchill and when that failed, wed his cousin. She lived on a diet of morphine and grouse, with the occasional cocktail thrown in. The colour Shocking Pink was created for her — and how she loved to shock! If it wasn’t morphine then it was opium or cocaine, and she loved nothing better than discussing her private collection of leather-bound volumes of pornography. When it came to sex she was a voracious man-eater, who’d steal her daughters’ boyfriends and seduce her best friends’ husbands. Yet Daisy Fellowes was also the living embodiment of Thirties chic, a style icon who inspired designers Chanel and Schiaparelli and who wore so many jewels they weighed her tiny body down. Heiress to the Singer sewing machine empire, she was ‘the very picture of fashionable depravity’, according to her rival Lady Diana Cooper. And Lady Diana should know — Daisy bedded her husband and determinedly remained his mistress for 17 years. The uber-rich Mrs Fellowes was also the greatest collector of fine jewellery the 20th century ever saw. Her rapacious and salacious life was remembered this week when one of her pieces — a crystal and pearl clip — was among the highlights of Sotheby’s spring gem sales. Though she became a central part of Mayfair society during the inter-war years, buying up the friendship of royalty, ministers, peers and moguls, Daisy was in fact half-French, half-American. Her mother was Isabelle Singer, daughter of the inventor of the first commercially successful sewing machine, while her father was a French aristocrat, the Duc Decazes. At 19, she was married off to Prince Jean de Broglie, but the relationship fell apart when she found him in bed with the chauffeur. Marriage, however, had unlocked an inextinguishable sexuality and soon she was to be found in the Ritz Hotel in Paris desperately trying to bed Winston Churchill, then a young MP. Though she became a central part of Mayfair society during the inter-war years, buying up the friendship of royalty, ministers, peers and moguls, Daisy was in fact half-French, half-American . According to Winston’s later private secretary, Jock Colville: ‘She was a wicked but attractive woman who, according to Mrs Churchill, tried to seduce her husband shortly after their marriage. It was unsuccessful and she was forgiven, even by Clementine.’ By now, Daisy had three children. ‘The oldest, Ermeline, is like my first husband only a great deal more masculine. The second, Isabelle, is like me, only without guts; the third was the result of a horrible man called Lischmann,’ she spat when someone gently inquired about them. Nonetheless she had a sneaking fondness for children — but only at a distance. One day strolling in a park, she exclaimed: ‘Oh look at those pretty little girls. Aren’t they beautifully dressed! We must go and ask the nurse whose they are.’ Walking over, Daisy duly asked: ‘Whose lovely little children are these?’ ‘Yours, Madam!’ snapped the nurse. ‘She was fascinating and I suppose wicked; her wickedness was on a scale that it had its own distinction,’ declared David Herbert, son of the Earl of Pembroke. Again, he should know — Daisy threw herself at his bumbling father in the hope of becoming an English countess. Daisy's second husband was the Hon. Reggie Fellowes (both pictured) - a banker, and son of the second Baron de Ramsey, connected to Winston Churchill through the Dukes of Marlborough, and a decidedly good egg . After a brief dalliance in Paris, Pembroke realised what a lightning storm he’d walked into and tried to back away. Her brother, now having succeeded their father as the Duc Decazes, claimed her reputation had been damaged by this rejection and challenged the bewildered Pembroke to a duel. The peer scuttled back across the English Channel and Daisy returned to flicking through the pages of Burke’s Peerage for a new husband. He was soon to arrive. But first Daisy decided that a little remodelling was in order. It was not sufficient that she was rich, she must have breeding and looks to match. After commissioning a portrait of herself she’d been appalled by the result and set to work. She had a nose-job, without anaesthetic, threw away her entire wardrobe and started to consult couturiers. And she began, very seriously, reading books. The Daisy that the Hon. Reggie Fellowes met and married was a very different article to the teenager who’d wed the Prince de Broglie. Her new husband was rich, a banker, the son of the second Baron de Ramsey, connected to Winston Churchill through the Dukes of Marlborough, and a decidedly good egg. The couple made their home in France, with frequent visits to London. In the milieu she now inhabited, sexual freedom was obligatory once she’d secured the marriage by having a child with Fellowes. A friend recalled Daisy in Monte Carlo with her lover Fred Cripps, later Lord Parmoor: ‘She and Fred tracked Reggie down to a brothel and through a rough glass window watched him perform with a poll [prostitute]. He didn’t know of course, but they told him afterwards.’ Rich, wayward, uncontrollable, her marriage remained a success despite her determination to cuckold as many wives as possible. She described herself as always being ‘on the scent’ of new conquest. ‘It’s a thrilling feeling,’ she confessed, ‘like tasting absinthe for the first time. Soon the man asks: “When may I come to tea?” — that’s when I sharpen the knife.’ The painter Sir Francis Rose was both fearful and admiring: ‘She’s as dangerous as an albatross,’ he declared. Another lover, Alfred Duff Cooper, father of writer John Julius Norwich, described how smoking opium before sex lowered her inhibitions to the point of extinction. As old age set in, Daisy's thoughts returned to her childhood. Her mother had committed suicide when Daisy was only four. Now her thoughts moved along similar lines and on more than one occasion she attempted to take her own life.  Pictured in 1962 . While in Paris she mixed with the new, thrilling art movement which included the writer Jean Cocteau and Sergei Diaghilev, founder of the Ballets Russes. When Diaghilev’s star ballerina complained of a headache, Daisy produced ‘a white powder which worked wonders’. It was cocaine, her new drug of choice. The composer and painter Lord Berners was similarly introduced to the dubious delights of cocaine by Daisy and was soon serving it during decorous tea-parties at Faringdon, his Oxfordshire stately home. But by the time Duff Cooper was Britain’s ambassador in Paris, at the end of World War II, Daisy had moved on again. Diana Cooper learned from her friendly rival — she tolerated, even encouraged, her husband’s on-off affair with Mrs Fellowes — how to jazz up a boring drinks party. ‘Just pour Benzedrine [an amphetamine] into the cocktails, darling!’ Daisy kept two yachts on the go, crewed and ready for action, in the Mediterranean. Her hospitality was lavish, but it came at a price. Society photographer Cecil Beaton jumped ship after a brutal few days cooped up with his hostess under azure-blue skies: ‘Daisy has been impossible. She bullies one person, keeping the others on her side until it’s time to bully the next person. She is spoilt, capricious, and wicked.’ Other guests on her bigger yacht, the Sister Anne, included the Prince of Wales and a then unknown American, Wallis Simpson. The romance between the soon-to-be King and his divorcee was still fresh, ‘otherwise, make no mistake, Daisy would have gone for him’, observed a fellow passenger. It was 1935 and the world would have to wait another year to discover who the Prince loved enough to give up his throne for — but in the calm waters of the Mediterranean Daisy Fellowes was already  privy to the country’s most devastating secret. All these things, good and bad, should have made Daisy the focus of Society’s attention, but it was her clothes — and her jewels — that people talked about most. There were diamonds, emeralds, sapphires, rubies, outside the Crown Jewels, there was nothing to match them. The big  jewellers of the day, Cartier, Van Cleef and Arpels, were in  seventh heaven for she never stopped shopping. Vogue magazine saluted her ‘for daring to be different’. At the Ritz, diners climbed on chairs to get a glimpse of her Schiaparelli monkey-fur coat embroidered in gold, and she shocked the public by wearing a Surrealist hat shaped like a high-heeled shoe. It was then that Schiaparelli invented ‘shocking pink’ for Daisy, and she wore it with panache — a lobster dress, or a black suit with pink lips for pockets. Alas, all legends fade and World War II helped reshape society. Daisy was getting older, while husband Reggie was in a wheelchair. She was deeply shamed to discover that her daughter, Jacqueline, who stayed in France and heroically worked for the French Resistance, had unknowingly married a German spy who betrayed her Resistance colleagues. Jacqueline, who retained her family title of Princess de Broglie, had her head shaved publicly as a punishment. A once-proud family, one of the richest in Europe, was humbled. As old age set in, Daisy’s thoughts returned to her childhood. Her mother had committed suicide when Daisy was only four. Now her thoughts moved along similar lines and on more than one occasion she attempted to take her own life. The long-suffering, fun-loving Reggie, who she stuck with till the bitter end, died around the time of her 63rd birthday. Daisy returned to Paris, to a vast town-house in the Rue de Lille, and slowly the shades were drawn around her. She died aged 72, but already the world had moved on. In the age of The Beatles, nobody cared to hear about a woman who wore a shoe for a hat, had a shade of pink named for her, collected the biggest set of priceless jewels ever known and encouraged people to take cocaine with their cup of tea. The new world seemed more interesting than that.","Daisy Fellowes was the living embodiment of Thirties chic .

"Even billionaires sometimes struggle to find space to park. For Roman Abramovich, that moment came when he tried to moor his £1billion yacht Eclipse - the largest in the world at 557ft long. The Russian tycoon was beaten to the only space in the harbour big enough to moor his giant vessel, Eclipse. Chelsea battleship: Eclipse, the world's biggest yacht, owned by Russian businessman Roman Abramovich, lies at anchor off the coast of Antibes, near Nice, south-eastern France . Saudi Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal . Alsaud - whose own yacht Kingdom KR5 is a mere 265ft long - took the . coveted mooring in ‘Millionaire’s Quay’ in Antibes, in the French . Riviera. Prince Al-Waleed is the world’s 26th richest man with £12.3billion, according to Forbes magazine, while Mr Abramovich is 53rd with a fortune of £8.4billion. Holiday on the Med: Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich and girlfriend Dasha Zhukova . The last space in Europe’s biggest yachting harbour simply wasn’t big enough for the two superyachts. So the Chelsea FC owner was left with . little option but to drop anchor several hundred feet out at sea - and . then travel to his villa on the shore by motorboat. Mr Abramovich’s crew had pleaded to . be allowed to moor in the harbour, but were told it would be impossible . to ‘squeeze Eclipse in’ as it was ‘far too big’. ‘Mr Abramovich has a villa in the . town, and is, of course, always welcome to disembark with his family, . but with a yacht this size it was not possible,’ a source at the port . said yesterday. ‘Instead Eclipse had to be sailed out to sea and left there.’ Mr Abramovich, 41, who has six . children with his first wife Irina and girlfriend Daria Zhukova, often . uses his fleet of luxury boats to ferry his family up and down the . Mediterranean. But none has ever compared to . Eclipse, which has two swimming pools, two helicopter pads, a dedicated . disco hall, around 30 cabins, a mini-submarine, and even a missile . defence system. Beaten: Chelsea-owning oligarch Abramovich's current flagship vessel Eclipse (pictured) will be knocked off the top spot by the new boat . People carrier: Mr Abramovich often uses his fleet of yachts to ferry his family, including his six children, up and down the Mediterranean . Luxury: Eclipse had an initial order cost of £300million, but this rose to nearly £1billion after all the fixtures and fittings Mr Abramovich wanted were added to the boat . This port ain't big enough for the both of us: The super yacht of Saudi Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal Alsaud was already moored in Antibes preventing Abramovich from parking his vessel . It also has armour-plating around . Abramovich’s master suite, bullet-proof windows and a laser system . designed to dazzle long-lens photographers. Fabulous wealth: Saudi Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal Alsaud . When it was ordered the initial cost . was estimated at around £330million, but by the time Mr Abramovich took . delivery last year it was spiralling towards the £1billion mark because . of the extra luxury fittings and security measures. Prince Al-Waleed’s vessel, though smaller, has a fascinating history of its own. The boat, which can carry 22 . passengers and 31 crew, was built in 1980 and bought by Saudi . billionaire, Adnan Khashoggi under the name Nabila. It featured in the 1983 James Bond film Never Say Never Again – as ‘The Flying Saucer’ – owned by villain Maximilian Largo. Its other owners have included Donald . Trump, who named it the Trump Princess. Prince Al-Waleed bought the . yacht in 1991, and renamed it Kingdom 5KR after his investment company . Kingdom Holdings, his lucky number 5 and the initials of two of his . children. The prince is the owner of the Savoy hotel in London, and his investment company plans to finance the construction of the world’s tallest building - the Kingdom Tower - in Saudi Arabia. Antibes is the largest yachting harbour in Europe with more than 2,000 moorings - but only one spot big enough for Eclipse. Mr Abramovich had applied to Antibes council three years ago to build his own pontoon at the villa, but the plans were rejected. A spokesman for the Antibes . International Yacht Club said: ‘The only space where it could fit is . already taken, though there are plans to build another large berth in . the coming coming years.’ Eclipse was built by the Blohm and Voss shipyard in Hamburg, Germany, and delivered to Abramovich last December. The oligarch also owns three other mega-yachts, the Pelorus (377ft), the . Ecstasea (282ft) and the Sussurro (161ft). Abramovich once lent the Pelorus to Chelsea footballers Frank Lampard and John Terry as a ‘bonus’ for playing well. Annual running costs for his fleet are around £16million including full tanks of petrol at around £70,000 per yacht.","Antibes port authorities tell tycoon there's no space for his superyacht .

"One of the Woolwich killers decided to convert to Islam after being inspired by a hate preacher who advocates killing gays and beating women, he has revealed in a letter. Michael Adebowale, 22, said that lectures posted online by notorious firebrand cleric Sheikh Khalid Yasin taught him the ‘purpose of life’. In the note written from Belmarsh Prison, he said he made the decision to convert to Islam in 2009 – around the same time that he was serving half of a 15-month sentence for supplying heroin. Inspiration: Michael Adebowale, left, converted to Islam after listening to a sermon by Khalid Yasin, right . Victim: Adebowale helped murder Fusilier Lee Rigby outside Woolwich Barracks in May this year . The letter, which uses his prisoner number A0882CY, is dated December . 20 – the day after he was convicted of Lee Rigby’s murder. 'I have always been Muslim for nearly five years. I have always been a fairly spiritual person and most of my friends at that time were Muslims. 'So the combination of the two factors caused me to start learning more about Islam. 'The more I learnt the more interested I became which led to me listening to a lecture by Sheikh Khalid Yaseen, you may have heard of him? 'He is based in the US. The title of the lecture is called ""What is the purpose of Life"". After hearing this I had to conclude that the purpose of life is to acknowledge and worship the creation as Allah said in Surat Az-Zaariyat: . '""I did not create the Jinn-kind and mankind except to worship me.""' Recalling . his introduction to the religion, he wrote: ‘I have been Muslim for . nearly five years. I have always been a fairly spiritual person and most . of my friends at that time were Muslims. ‘So the combination of the two factors caused me to start learning more about Islam.’ He added: ‘The more I learnt the more interested I became which led to me listening to a lecture by Sheikh Khalid Yasin. ‘The . title of this lecture is called “What is the Purpose of Life?” After . hearing this I had to conclude that the purpose of life is to . acknowledge and worship the creator.’ Yasin, who calls the . Taliban his ‘brothers’, has been given free rein to tour the world and . spread his vile views – stopping off in countries including Britain and . the US. Linked to the hardline Wahhabi branch of Islam, he has . previously denounced both Christian and Jewish beliefs as ‘filth’ and . believes there can be no such thing as gender equality. He claims that . the Koran gives men permission to ‘beat women lightly’ and thinks all . Muslims should shun anyone who does not follow their faith. He has also called homosexuality an ‘aberration’ that should be ‘punishable by death’. Guilty: Adebowale, left, and Michael Adebolajo, right, were convicted of murder earlier this month . Alienated: Adebowale's mother Juliet Obasuyi has spoken out against his horrific crimes . And DVDs of his sermons were given to would-be jihadists who were being recruited in Britain’s streets to fight in Afghanistan. Adebowale . and his accomplice Michael Adebolajo, 29, were convicted earlier this . month of murdering Fusilier Lee Rigby outside his barracks in Woolwich. Both . killers were also inspired by Anjem Choudary and Adebolajo was filmed . standing alongside  the hate cleric at demonstrations. The pair, who . were brought up in Christian families, face spending the rest of their . lives behind bars when they are sentenced next year. The hand-written . letter is the first insight into the mind of Adebowale, who refused to . give evidence during the Old Bailey trial. His fragile mental . state repeatedly delayed court proceedings  as his barristers claimed he . could not face the dock or make important decisions about his defence. In it, he complained that his family did not understand his views, . writing: ‘They aren’t Muslim so I never get that “click” with them. May . Allah forgive their mistakes.’ He also wrote of his . disappointment that he has been ‘ill-judged’ and offered ‘little . support’ from  fellow Muslims who were appalled  by the atrocity. Writing from  his solitary confinement cell, he said: ‘The trial has now . come to  an end and me and my brother  in Islam are waiting till next . year  as the case was adjourned for sentencing. Hate speech: Yasin has previously called for gay people to be put to death . Controversy: The preacher was born in New York City and converted to Islam as a teenager . ‘I have had little support as you can imagine, many people are shocked and many Muslims sadly ill-judged me, Allah help them.’ Adebowale also said he had changed his name to Ismail ‘because I knew about the Prophet Ismail from Christianity’. Adebowale and Adebolajo said they killed Mr Rigby in May in revenge for British troops being in Muslim countries. They . ran him over in a car, almost decapitated him and then dragged him into . the middle of the road and ordered onlookers to film them.

With a population of 171,000, the southern city is the most Bible-minded in the country, with the majority of its citizens reading the Bible regularly outside of church and believing the centuries-old book is accurate. Chattanooga overtook Knoxville, Tennessee, in 2013, in the society's second consecutive study into the nation's Godliness. Unsurprisingly, the Midwest and the South dominated the most Bible-minded areas, with Birmingham, Alabama taking second spot followed by Lynchburg, Virginia; Springfield, Montana and Shreveport, Louisiana. Little Rock, Arkansas and Jackson, Mississippi also made the top 10. What was surprising was New York City's absence from the 10 least Bible-minded cities rank for 2013.

"A leading British motorcycle journalist has died in an accident during the press launch of a new bike in South Africa. Kevin Ash was killed while testing BMW's R1200GS motorcycle in the rugged landscape around the town of George some 155 miles east of Cape Town. The father-of-three wrote for a number of motor publications and was The Daily Telegraph's motorcycling correspondent for 15 years. Tragedy: Motorcycle journalist Kevin Ash has died following an accident at a BMW event for their new bike in South Africa . According to reports, the accident happened as groups of journalists were on a two-day ride to test BMW’s new R1200GS motorbike. On the day of the accident one . motorcycle journalist wrote that the groups were ‘just about to head . off-road and try out the new endure mode’. Motorcycle.com reported that the accident is believed to have happened during the test drive. Kevin Ash was riding with a party of journalists . and died at the scene. An official statement released by BMW . late last night read: 'It is with deep regret that BMW Motorrad . confirms the fatal injury of Kevin Ash in a motorcycle accident during a . launch event in South Africa. 'Kevin Ash passed away on January 22nd due to a motorcycle accident during a press launch in South Africa. 'The . phrase ""he died doing what he loved"" sprang to mind but I would like to . stamp that firmly out. He loved his family more and we love him. 'As his oldest daughter, I only . recently started to fully realise just how much further his parenting . went than most; on receiving a tearful phone call at Stanstead airport . it was a natural response to immediately cancel his press launch and . ride back home to teach trigonometry the night before exams. 'Everything he did was entirely for his children and his wife, and a little bit for his cat. 'My parents loved each other very much and I hope that one day we can learn to live without him.'

'As his oldest daughter, I only recently started to fully realise just how much further his parenting went than most; on receiving a tearful phone call at Stanstead airport it was a natural response to immediately cancel his press launch and ride back home to teach trigonometry the night before exams. 'Everything he did was entirely for his children and his wife, and a little bit for his cat. 'My parents loved each other very much and I hope that one day we can learn to live without him.' In a statement on its website, Motorcycle News said it was ‘deeply saddened’ at his death. ‘Known for his technical authority, . clarity of expression and prolific output, Kevin was also sharp-witted, . great company, a devoted husband and father to his wife and three . daughters and universally liked. MCN passes on our deep condolences to his family.' Location: Mr Ash was killed while testing a BMW bike around the town of George some 155 miles east of Cape Town . Adrian Roderick, general manager for BMW Motorrad UK, said: ‘We are shocked and deeply saddened to hear the awful news about Kevin Ash; one of the most well-liked, experienced and respected journalists in the extremely close-knit motorcycle community. 'Losing Kevin is a tragedy which will be felt across the entire industry. He was a friend, as much as a journalist, and will be sorely missed. Our heartfelt thoughts are with his family, friends and colleagues at this awful time.’ A keen racer, Mr Ash worked as a motorcycle courier before getting his break in Journalism when his employer Colin Schiller launched the magazine Fast Bikes. He then worked for the highly respected Motocycle News (MCN) publication before going freelance and becoming motorycle correspondent for the Daily Telegraph - a post which he held for a around 15 years. Today tributes were flooding in onto his popular website Ashonbikes.com. One user Markyboyzx6r posted: 'Absolute numbing shock to hear such terrible news. I’m so sorry to all of Kevin’s family, colleagues and friends. 'Kevin was a fantastic journalist. He had the ability to write about the finer technical details of motorcycle engineering and make it understandable and interesting for non-technical people like me. 'His columns in the Telegraph were always highly informed, free from hyperbole and honest. But it was on this site ashonbikes, that I really got to know Kev - his basic niceness, his enthusiasm for biking and good bloke status were always clear to see. 'He always took the time to contribute to discussions, was helpful to all readers and his helpfulness made this a very civilised place to post ideas. And user KurtVerbose wrote: 'I shall really miss his articles as there's no other motorcycle journalist who writes with such intelligence and insight.'","Kevin Ash died in motorcycle accident at BMW launch of R1200GS bike .

"The 13-year-old boy who was found behind a false wall at the weekend after being missing for four years has told how he used his phone to contact his biological mother. Gregory Jean Jr. said: 'I just went on [Google] Play Store and I downloaded an app called Magic Jack and I called my mom.' It is not clear how the teenager managed to get hold of the phone, but once downloaded the App allows users free calling to the US and Canada. Gregory went missing in 2010, when he went to visit his father Gregory Jean, 37, and his stepmother Samantha Joy Davis, 42 - the pair are both charged with the false imprisonment and cruelty against Gregory at their home in Jonesboro, a suburb of Atlanta, Georgia. Davis is on probation for punishing her biological son by cutting his tongue with a pair of hot scissors in 2004. Gregory Jean Jr, the 13-year-old boy who was found behind a false wall at the weekend after going missing for four years has told how he used his phone to contact his biological mother. Pictured: Gregory Jean Jr in an undated photo . Reunited: Gregory Jean Jr,  is pictured being reunited with his Florida-based mother after he was found imprisoned behind a false wall in the linen closet of his father's Georgia home four years after going missing . Captors: Father Gregory Jean, 37 (left), and stepmother Samantha Joy Davis, 42 (right), appeared in court Sunday morning on charges of false imprisonment, obstruction and cruelty to a child after Jean's son was found hidden behind a linen closet at their home . Today his biological mother, Lisa Smith told CBS46 she had talked to her son a few times during the four-year period he was missing and said their emotional reunion 'feels good.' She said she now has custody of Gregory and added that she was a U.S. citizen but refused to comment on why she had not  reported her son missing. A press conference today revealed that the 'hidden compartment' where Gregory was found, was an attic space connected to a garage by a crawl-through in a linen closet. First appearance: Jean (left) and David (right) take the stand in Clayton County, Georgia court on Sunday. They were remanded . When police attended the home at 11pm on Friday they could originally not find the boy, but Gregory then gave them more details and they returned - he was found behind the 'access panel' at 2am. 'The victim had signs of physical assault and was very emotionally distraught,' Clayton County Police Chief Gregory Porter said, reports NBC News. The police supervisor who found him said that after he calmed down, Gregory kept repeating his thanks and gratitude. Police said Gregory had been in the attic area 'temporarily' and actually shared a bedroom with one of the other juveniles in the home. In court on Sunday, a judge revealed that Davis allegedly hit the boy on his buttocks and legs with a stick. Arrests: The boy went missing in 2010, when he went to see his father and never returned. His mother allegedly never informed police since she is an immigrant and unfamiliar with the system. Above, the house where he was held captive . No clue: Neighbors in the Jonesboro neighborhood said they often saw the boy outside the house, and never thought he was being held prisoner . He denied a bond after learning that Davis is currently on probation in Henry County for child cruelty. The judge also denied a bond for Jean and said a fugitive of justice case appeared on the record of Jean, who is a U.S. citizen from Haiti. 'They dismissed the case,' Jean insisted. 'That was not me. They had the wrong person.' Judge Richard Brown refused both suspects bail and they were remanded to Clayton County Jail until their next appearance on December 9. There is no indication Gregory attended school, and neighbors have said they often saw him doing yard work. Neighbors in the Atlanta, Georgia suburb  have spoken out to say they saw the boy often and never knew he was being held against his will. Investigation: CID officers are pictured arriving at the house on Saturday morning. An investigation is ongoing . Jean's neighbor's in the Atlanta suburb of  Jonesboro were shocked to hear that the Gregory was a prisoner. They say they often saw him outside the house, sometimes doing yard work. 'It was a shock to all of us. They were really nice people, very open they said come over anytime you want,' neighbor Julie Pizarro, who lives across the street told WXIA. 'The young man didn't seem under any distress. I guess you never know what's behind closed doors.' 'Gosh, it was right under our nose,' neighbor Akono Ekundayo said. 'We could have done something.' Proud: Police Chief Greg Porter (left) said: 'The police department did an excellent job coming out here and responding to the 911 emergency call.' Right, one of the boy's relatives weeps after being reunited with him . Scene: Police have now requested a search warrant for the property in Duke Court (pictured) In heart-wrenching scenes on Saturday morning, Gregory was pictured clinging on to his weeping mother, who had traveled to Georgia, as another female relative sobbed uncontrollably nearby in an emotional reunion. Sergeant Joanne Southerland, of Clayton County Police Department, told the news station: 'We came here to the home and were able to get inside and talk to the people inside. 'After several minutes of denying that the child was here and that there was ever any assault or anything like that, we were able to find him in the linen closet.' Officer Daniel Day added: 'I just couldn't believe it. We found him, we saw him. To say it was a great feeling is an understatement. He just couldn't thank us enough, he was overjoyed we had found him.'","Gregory Jean Jr. found at his father's home in Jonesboro, Georgia .

"A growing controversy surrounding the results of the ladies’ free skate in Sochi this week reached a fever pitch after images surfaced showing a Russian judge hugging her 17-year-old compatriot just moments after her surprise victory. The stills were taken from Thursday's Olympic coverage by the Korean TV channel SBS. In the pictures, skating judge Alla Shekhovtsova is seen warmly embracing Adelina Sotnikova, who skated to victory over reigning Olympic champion Yuna Kim, of South Korea. Scroll down for video . Compromising position: Cameras set up by South Korean channel SBS caught Russian figure skating judge Alla Shekhovstova (left) warmly embracing Russia's Adelina Sotnikova (right) after her win . Authority figure: Shekhovtsova, seen right during the free skate, was on the judging panel that handed Sotnikova a victory over South Korea's Yuna Kim . The veteran International Skating Union referee (left), who is also married to a top Russian figure skating official, was among a throng of people waiting backstage to congratulate Sotnikova . The Chicago Tribune, which obtained the stills from SBS, got a confirmation from an NBC staffer that cameras set up backstage at the Iceberg Skating Palace caught the women celebrating together Sotnikova’s gold medal. The compromising images have caused an uproar among South Koreans on Twitter and in local media. While the cuddle does not suggest in any way that Miss Shekhovtsova had judged the free skate unfairly, critics have said that rushing backstage to congratulate her compatriot in full view of cameras was a bad judgment call. Beside her role as a long-time International Skating Union judge, Shekhovtsova is also the wife of General Director of the Russian Figure Skating Federation Valentin Piseev. Meanwhile, more than 1.9million people have signed a Change.org petition demanding that an investigation into the judging decisions in Thursday night's women's figure skating competition be opened. Sotnikova finished with a total score of 224.59, beating Kim's score of 219.11 by 5.48 points after the free skate program, becoming the first female Russian skater to win in the category. Controversial win: Adelina Sotnikova of Russia (center), Yuna Kim of South Korea (left) and Carolina Kostner of Italy stand on the podium during the flower ceremony for the women's free skate figure skating final at the Iceberg Skating Palace . Kim would have been the third woman in history to defend her Olympic gold medal after her landslide win at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics where she beat her closest rival by 23.06 points. However, that title eluded her when Sotnikova was announced as the gold-medal winner with Kim in second and Italian Carolina Kostner with bronze. The reaction was immediate and vocal, with more than 700,000 people signing the petition within six hours. Many called for greater transparency in the judging panel, which was overwhelmingly made up of Eastern Bloc nations. Petition: This Change.org petition has been signed almost 1.8 million times since Thursday . Shock: Many in the figure skating world expressed surprise that Yuna Kim did not win gold for her performance . Upstart: The young Russian dethroned the 'Queen' Yuna Kim, to the chagrin of many . One of the judges, whose votes were . anonymous, was Yuri Balkov of the Ukraine who was caught on camera . trying to fix an event at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano. Another, Alla Shekhovtsova, is married to the head of the Russian figure skating federation, reports USA Today. Critics . pointed to another Russian skater in the competition, Yulia . Lipnitskaya, who fell more than once during her program yet still . managed to beat American Ashley Wagner, who came in seventh. 'I feel gypped,' Wagner said at a news conference Thursday. 'People don't want to watch a sport where you see people fall down and somehow score above someone who goes clean.' Historical: Carlina Kostner won Italy's first-ever Olympic figure skating singles medal . Speaking to Yahoo! Sports, Wagner said the results of the free skate have left her ‘speechless.’ However, the 22-year-old skater's comments came as a surprise to Sotnikova’s  coach, Elena Buianova, who told Russian reporters from Izvestia.ru Friday that Wagner approached her rival backstage after the free skate and congratulated her, telling Adelina that her victory was well-deserved. Buianova also came to Shekhovtsova’s defense, insisting that her judging has always been objective. Sotnikova herself has brushed off the brewing scandal and the petition. The 17-year-old sounded defiant during a recent interview, stating in Russian that her goal is to win 'all the gold possible - and more than once.' Even Eteri Tutberidze, who coaches skater Yulia Lipnitskaya – Sotnikova’s Russian rival - publicly said that the 17-year-old deserved to be at the top of the podium. 'In my opinion, it is not right at this time to discuss who is married to whom,' Tutberidze said, referring to Shakhovstova. Tutberidze went on to say that she had reviewed recordings of Sotnikova  and Kim's free skates, and came to a conclusion that the Russian's quality of skating and artistry were superior to Kim's performance Thursday night. The current scoring system rates the . technical elements of a skater's routine, then the execution and . presentation using a cumulative system. The . most problematic impact of the system is that judges are now allowed to . give their scores anonymously, Eric Zitzewitz, an economist at . Dartmouth University who has studied judging bias, told ABCNews.com. Judges' tendencies to inflate scores for athletes from their own countries and . trade votes with other judges has increased 20 per cent since the rules . were changed in 2004, according to Zitzweitz. Second place: Silver medalist South Korea's Yuna Kim smiles during the victory ceremony for the figure skating women's free skating program . Triumph: Gold medalist Adelina Sotnikova of Russia celebrates during the medal ceremony for the Women's Free Figure Skating on day fourteen of the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics . Stoic: Kim did not question the judges' scoring of her program at the press conference following the figure skating finals . Kim herself remained above all the fuss being made over the alleged robbery of her second Olympic gold medal. 'The scores are given by the judges, so I am not in the right position to comment on it,' Kim said. 'There’s nothing that will change with my words. The biggest thing was I felt relieved because it was over.' Sotnikova seemed oblivious to the questions raised over her win. 'I won. It's my gold medal. I can't believe it,' she said. 'Two years ago, all of my competitions were very bad. I didn't know if I had what it takes to be successful. Now I know that I do.'","Russian Adelina Sotnikova beat out favorite South Korean Yuna Kim to the figure skating gold medal .

"Falsely accused: Sunil Tripathi, 22, was wrongly fingered as the Boston marathon bomber on Reddit . A Rhode Island family is anxiously awaiting news from authorities on whether the body they pulled from Providence River on Tuesday evening is their son, missing Brown student Sunil Tripathi. Police found the body around 6 p.m. and said they think it is 'very possible' that it is Tripathi, who was wrongly accused of being one of the . Boston Marathon bombers. Tripathi, 22, has been missing since the middle of March. Authorities are hoping to reveal the identity of the body today, but police lieutenant Joseph . Donnelly told The Boston Globe that 'it's very, very possible' that it . is Tripathi. The body was discovered on Tuesday evening around 6 p.m. in the river near the Wyndham Garden Providence Hotel, but it is not yet known when the person died. The hotel is a little over a mile from . Tripathi's apartment on Angell Street where he was last seen on March . 16. His cell phone and wallet were left in his apartment. The body was discovered by the coach of the Brown University crew team during practice. As news spread that his body had possibly been discovered, tributes to the student poured in through his family's Facebook page, 'Help Us Find Sunil Tripathi.' 'Sending prayers to you and your family!' wrote Michelle Tanenbaum Copelin. 'Praying the report this morning is not true!' Joanne Hubble wrote, 'I know you already are, but hold onto each other and just keep holding onto each other. So many around the world are trying to help hold you all.' Discovery: The body was discovered by the coach of the Brown University crew team during practice . Location: This is where the body was discovered on Tuesday evening around 6 p.m., in the river near the Wyndham Garden Providence Hotel . Tragic: Sunil Tripathi, seen here with his mother and sister, has been missing since last month. He left his cell phone and wallet when he walked out the door . Search: His family and friends frantically searched for him . Added April Jenson: 'My thoughts and prayers are with your family alone today.' The discovery comes just one day after . a Reddit moderator put out an apology to Tripathi's family after . internet commentators falsely accused him of being one of the bombers. 'I'd like to extend the deepest . apologies to the family of Sunil Tripathi for any part we may have had . in relaying what has turned out to be faulty information,' the moderator . of the FindBostonBombers subreddit wrote in a statement. 'We cannot begin to know what you're going through and for that we are truly sorry. 'Several users, twitter users, and . other sources had heard him identified as the suspect and believed it to . be confirmed. We were mistaken.' The apologies didn't stop there, as . Erik Martin, the general manager of Reddit, also sent out an email 'to . apologize personally and on behalf of all our employees for...some of . the people on our site's role in the spreading of this false idea about . Sunny.' It is not clear exactly how Tripathi went from being a missing person to wrongly becoming the prime suspect in the manhunt for the Tsarnaev brothers. But it appears speculation started on social news site Reddit, with several users claiming on the forum last Thursday evening that he was being sought by thousands of police and SWAT team officers over the attack. Remembrance: As news spread that his body had possibly been discovered, tributes to the student poured in through his family's Facebook page, 'Help Us Find Sunil Tripathi' Some claimed his name had been mentioned between officers on the police scanner and one woman who said she went to school with Tripathi alleged CCTV images of one of the real suspects 'looked like him.' Then, after the suspects engaged in a raging gun battle with police, some Twitter users began circulating the police scanner claims, setting off a storm of further storm of speculation. A cameraman with a Hartford affiliate of the CBS television network also tweeted: 'BPD scanner has identified the names' before naming 'Suspect 2' as Sunil Tripathi. A review of recordings from police radio traffic, though, shows Tripathi was never mentioned by police, according to the Atlantic. Real suspects: 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (left, in the white cape) and his 26-year-old brother Tamerlan (right in a black hat and glasses) were identified hours after police released their photos on Thursday evening . Wrong guy: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (left) has reportedly admitted to being the Boston Marathon bomber, and said that he and his brother acted alone, meaning Sunil (right) had nothing to do with it . But with the story gathering pace on . social media, many users began to celebrate how they had found the . suspect in the 'white hat' - a reference to the fact one of the images . showed alleged bomber Dzhokar in a baseball cap of that colour. Yet all chose to ignore the fact Tripathi had not been named by police as a suspect. Within hours, vile messages began . cropping up on Sunil's Facebook page and about a dozen news vans camped . outside the family's home in Radnor, Pennsylvania. By dawn on Friday, the suspects had . been formally named - brothers Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, whose . family is from the breakaway Russian region of Chechnya. The only consolation that his family . took from the incident was that perhaps the internet sleuths may use the . energy that they applied to sending vicious emails and threats after . the false accusation to help find the missing student. The Reddit contributor who started the forum dedicated to identifying the Boston Marathon bombers announced that he is quitting the community site. The user, identified only by his screen name of 'Oops777' said that it was a mistake to do so, and is now facing a massive backlash following their incorrect accusations. He said that the goal of the forum was 'to consolidate the already existing posts floating around /r/news and /r/boston.' He announced his departure from the site as part of a Reddit 'AMA', which stands for Ask Me Anything. 'We find it incredibly unfortunate that . media outlets were so quick to jump without checking with authorities, . but we hope they use the same energy and intensity they showed in the . past 24 hours to really help us find Sunil,' Sangeeta Tripathi, Sunil's sister told Mother Jones earlier this week. As the erroneous reports about . Tripathi continued to spread online, his family, huddled around their . computers in Providence, Rhode Island, felt helpless as Internet users . leveled accusation after accusation against their missing relative. ‘Someone will tweet, then retweet, and . completely unsubstantiated things can proliferate so rapidly and . destructively,’ Sunil's sister Sangeeta Tripathi said in an interview on . Friday. ‘Those night hours were horrible.’ 'It seems this is just the ugly underbelly of viral social media,' she later told NBC News. 'But a lot of stir can be created through just a complete accusatory and unsubstantiated effort.' The true suspects, 19-year-old . Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his 26-year-old brother Tamerlan, were identified . hours after police released their photos on Thursday evening. Tamerlan was shot in an altercation . with police early Friday morning but actually only died when his brother . ran over him in the getaway car. Dzhokhar was captured by police Friday evening and remains in FBI custody. Searching: His family started a Facebook group soon after his March 16 disappearance . At a crossroads: Sunil Tripathi had taken a . leave of absence from Brown recently and was volunteering at a library . while deciding what to do next . Grainy images from a surveillance . camera have come to light showing a figure believed to be Tripathi . moments after leaving his home at 1.33am, just 20 minutes after he last . used his computer, according to ABC News. Police checked Tripathi's online . activity and bank accounts, but reportedly found no leads. They did come . across what they have characterized as a vague note in the student's . apartment, but will not go into details. The missing man’s bicycle, which he . used frequently to get around, was at the unit he shared with several . other university students. Tripathi's siblings, Ravi and . Sangeeta, have been canvassing Providence and its suburbs in hopes of . uncovering new clues leading to their missing baby brother. Their desperate search took them to coffee shops, stores, homeless shelters, soup kitchens hospital and morgues. Sensitive soul: The philosophy major, right, was described by his older brother, left, as a man who found pleasure in simple things like classical music . 'Everyone's racking their brains to . see if they can come up with places that he might be or where he might . have gone,' Ravi Tripathi, 26, said. The student's brother described him . as a quiet man who found pleasure in simple things like listening to . classical music. He also revealed that his sibling suffers from . depression. The close-knit family last heard from Sunil, known to his loved ones as Sunny, the night before he vanished. ‘Between family and friends, we are in constant contact with him,’ Sangeeta, 30, told ABC News on Sunday. ‘We became worried when he didn't respond to many missed calls,’ she said. Items left behind: Sangeeta Tripathi, the missing student's sister, says his wallet, ID cards, credit cards and cell phone were found in his room . Tripathi, 22, is a philosophy major at Brown and grew up in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. He has been living in Providence, Rhode Island, since 2008 and was on approved leave from the Ivy League school he is enrolled at. According to his brother, Sunil had taken a leave from Brown recently and was spending his time volunteering at a local library. He was last seen in the campus area wearing a pair of blue jeans, a black Eastern Mountain Sports ski jacket, glasses and a Philadelphia Eagles wool hat, according to witness reports. It is unclear what if any identifying features the body found in the Providence River had on him to make police blieve that it is Sunil.","'Body of Sunil Tripathi' discovered in the Providence River in Boston .

But Van Gaal struggled to dress this up as anything other than a disappointing performance, even if he did at least take the kind of risks that many continue to demand of the Dutchman. After a first half that finished with a goal apiece, with Ki Sung-yeung equalising for Garry Monk’s side a couple of minutes after Ander Herrera had opened the scoring, Van Gaal displayed some genuine ambition by replacing his more defensive full backs with Antonio Valencia and Ashley Young. It had not been a terribly successful afternoon for Luke Shaw or Paddy McNair. They struggled against Swansea’s width and pace. But Valencia and Young’s introduction remained a bold move, and one that worked until Gomis diverted Shelvey’s effort beyond De Gea. United had dominated the second half, leaving Van Gaal ‘amazed’ that his side had lost. Monk, however, made the point afterwards that United managed only one shot on target after the break and, in fairness to Van Gaal, he too admitted that his players made little of the possession they had enjoyed. He said they were not ‘effective’, adding that he would need to study slow motion replays to determine exactly why. In real time here at the Liberty Stadium, Swansea were able to savour completing a Premier League double over the Old Trafford club because of the lack of cohesion and fluency that has too often been evident in United’s football this season. They remain very much a work in progress for their former Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Ajax boss. Gary Neville is probably right. It is time to stop pining about the football that was played under Sir Alex Ferguson and accept that, with the players currently at his disposal, Van Gaal is doing things differently. But that 81 per cent approval rating he received in a Manchester Evening News poll might drop a few points if there are too many more displays like this. For now, United have dropped only a place in the Premier League and remain in a Champions League spot. But Southampton need only draw against Liverpool to move above them and that might yet make life more uncomfortable for a manager set the target by his bosses of finishing third this season. Ferguson had a saying for such anxious moments but, Neville would no doubt agree, it should probably be retired with him. It felt like a short step back in time with Wayne Rooney paired with Robin van Persie in attack. Radamel Falcao was left on the bench. The result was Rooney’s first shot on target in the Premier League in 2015, albeit an effort that was probably symptomatic of too many matches spent in midfield.

Herrera slides on his knees as the Manchester United midfielder celebrates his fifth goal since his summer arrival . Alongside him, though, was a player who continues to look a shadow of the forward who inspired that last Premier League title only two seasons ago. Van Persie was dreadful even before he suffered what seems to be a serious injury. A midfield comprising Herrera, Angel di Maria, Marouane Fellaini and Daley Blind was not entirely convincing either. No sooner had this contest begun than United were almost a goal down, Herrera clearing a powerful Gomis header off the line. It was close, as the goalline technology quickly illustrated. But what amounted to a fairly open first half saw United land the first blow after 28 minutes, Rooney and Di Maria combining well before Herrera unleashed a marvellous first-time strike that beat Lukasz Fabianski via the inside of his far post. Van Gaal punched the air in celebration, and understandably so. But barely 90 seconds later he might have been tempted to thump his defenders for failing to defend a teasing cross from Shelvey. Ki reacted quickest, surging ahead of Shaw to beat De Gea from close range. Van Gaal made one change at the break, replacing young McNair at right back with Valencia. And it was not long before Shaw had been hooked too, for Young. If that summed up Van Gaal’s view of his full backs, it also remained a statement of intend and United did gain momentum with the changes. For long periods, Swansea found themselves camped deep in their own half, with United pressing but unable to break through a backline led impressively by Ashley Williams. It made the decisive goal all the more frustrating for Van Gaal, a goal scored very much on the counter-attack. But, as Van Gaal said, you need to convert the chances you create, and rarely did United ever look capable of doing that.

"A female student who was allegedly raped by her former boyfriend has claimed her Christian college has accused her of 'harassment' after she filed a complaint against him. The student, identified only by her first name Samantha, says she now faces possible expulsion from Hanover College in Indiana for repeatedly calling for punishment over the alleged sexual assault, which she says took place in March 2012 while staying at her former boyfriend's fraternity house. Following a complaint from Samantha, the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights has reportedly informed the small college of 1,100 students that it has been placed under investigation. Under investigation: The student says she now faces possible expulsion from Hanover College in Indiana (pictured) for repeatedly calling for punishment over the alleged sexual assault . Two years of correspondence between Samantha and the college reportedly showed she had been told to take her complaint of sexual assault and ongoing harassment to the police and at one point had been asked to move off campus. This is despite a U.S federal gender equality law requiring colleges to make every effort to prevent and intervene in all incidents of harassment that have been brought to their attention. According to the Huffington Post, the episode began shortly before a week-long holiday in the autumn of 2011, when Samantha fell out with her then dormitory roommate and the college gave her roughly one day's notice to leave the property. She claims the college subsequently failed to provide alternative accommodation, leaving her little option other than the stay with her former boyfriend and his fraternity house. She says it was during this period that her former boyfriend sexually assaulted her after he had been drinking heavily. Samantha says it was roughly one month before she felt comfortable enough to report the sexual assault, adding that she had requested to speak to a female security officer. She claims, however, that a  male security officer pressured her into reporting it to him instead and refused to let her leave the room until she signed a written agreement not to press criminal charges. A later hearing at the college found Samantha's former boyfriend not guilty of the alleged sexual assault after he claimed not to have been in the building at the time, and concluded that the male security officer had simply been 'anxious to help'. A spokeswoman for Hanover (pictured) insisted the college takes all reports of sexual misconduct seriously and insisted it would fully cooperate with the Department for Education's investigation . Over the following two years, Samantha says her former boyfriend's new girlfriend repeatedly harassed her as she fought to have the case against him reopened. The Office for Civil Rights initially worked with Samantha and reached a mediation agreement last summer to allow her to file a claim of harassment against her alleged attacker and his new girlfriend. When that case was dismissed last November, the college then allowed the couple to claim that it was in fact them who were being subjected to harassment, claiming Samantha's repeat attempts to have sexual assault charges filed against her former boyfriend breached their rights. The college was quoted by the Huffington Post as saying that it concluded that the attempts to have alleged attacker punished 'whether . through campus security, the campus conduct review process, his . fraternity, the court system, or the Department of Education, do appear . to be a type of harassment'. They reportedly added that Samantha would face no punishment however, as the form of harassment they were accusing her of isn't covered by the school code of conduct. The Office for Civil Rights is now investigating whether the college failed in its duty to stop harasment against Samantha after it had been reported, and whether or not it had permitted retaliation against a sexual assault victim when allowing the alleged attacker and his girlfriend permission to file their own harassment claim. A spokesman for Hanover insisted the college takes all reports of sexual misconduct seriously and insisted it would fully cooperate with the Department for Education's investigation. In the meantime, 38 students have reportedly signed a letter in support of Samantha warning they will withhold donations and discourage people from attending Hanover until the case is resolved and the college overhauls its policies on sexual assault.","Victim says alleged attacker wasn't adequately punished for sexual assault .

"Front Row host Mark Lawson stepped down after disagreements with management . The BBC maintained a wall of silence yesterday over 'bullying claims' against its arts presenter Mark Lawson. The Front Row host has stepped down from his Radio 4 programme after editorial disagreements with management. But bosses refused to give any details of the issues or say if he will return to radio. The 51-year-old works for the BBC as a self-employed freelancer so he cannot be fired by the Corporation. Next week, the new series of his BBC4 show Mark Lawson Talks To... will go ahead as scheduled. Lawson has not spoken publicly about his departure since the news was revealed  yesterday. Neighbours at his Northamptonshire farmhouse said he decided to ‘escape for a while’ rather than answer the allegations. However, some of the broadcaster’s friends have already leapt to his defence and accused the BBC of overreacting. Writing on Twitter, author and journalist Tony Parsons – who wrote the bestselling novel Man and Boy – said he was ‘shocked and saddened’ by the news. He added: ‘He is a real gentle giant and the BBC are starting to get hysterical. I worked with him for six years and I have never known anyone less like a bully than Mark Lawson. Total pro: respectful and friendly to all.’ During a two-decade long career in which he has had more than 3,000 guests on his show, Mark Lawson was proud of what he called his sensitive questioning technique. In an interview last October, he said he was particularly keen not to encourage his guests to become too emotional. ‘I’m always uneasy both as a viewer and an interviewer with tears on TV because it is one  of the most private reflexes becoming public,’ he said. But some production staff at the BBC Radio arts unit that produces Front Row claim to have seen a very different side to the presenter, labelling him a bully who was capable of reducing women to tears. According to one insider, the response by BBC management until now was to move any staff who claimed to be unhappy rather than to confront Lawson, because it didn’t want to risk upsetting one of its stars. Programme: Next week, the new series of his BBC4 show Mark Lawson Talks To..., which last year featured Steve Coogan will go ahead as scheduled . But with the recent launch of a BBC confidential 24-hour ‘bullying and harassment’ telephone line for staff and freelancers, the situation changed. The BBC’s human resources department emailed staff, asking if anyone had been subjected to harassment. Within days of the email, a letter signed by 15 current and former production staff was sent to Graham Ellis, the deputy head of BBC Radio, which described a ‘culture of bullying and a failure of management to protect staff’. Tony Hall, the BBC’s director-general, had also pledged a ‘zero tolerance’ approach to bullying after a critical report by a QC in the wake of the Jimmy Savile child abuse scandal. The report uncovered 37 complaints of sexual harassment and highlighted problems involving ‘known bullies’ and identified complainants who had been working in ‘a climate of fear and anxiety’. Lawson was not identified as one of the culprits, even though it is believed that management knew there had been ‘issues’ with his behaviour. Crackdown: Tony Hall, the BBC's director-general, had also pledged a 'zero tolerance' approach to bullying after a critical report by a QC in the wake of the Jimmy Savile child abuse scandal . Bosses were not thought to be keen on action because Lawson was regarded as a ‘brilliant presenter’ – having interviewed some of the biggest names in the arts world, including Robert de Niro, Woody Allen and Helen  Mirren. But a senior BBC source said yesterday that after the  letter of complaint, an internal inquiry was launched last October involving two managers from Salford and two members of the human resources team. Their conclusion was that  ‘Lawson’s position had become untenable’. Lawson was born in St Albans, where he attended a fee-paying Catholic school before studying English at university in London. He lives with his wife Sarah, two sons and daughter in a £500,000 detached stone cottage in Towcester. During the week, Lawson stays in a rented one-bedroom flat in fashionable  Notting Hill, west London. As a freelancer, the BBC pays him through a service company, Wilanben, of which his wife is a director. As he is taxed as a company director rather than an individual, the corporation tax he pays on profits is up to 20 per cent lower than income tax paid by other high-earners on PAYE. He has also been a columnist on The Guardian newspaper. A BBC spokesman said: ‘We don’t confirm or comment on human resources issues.’","Front Row host, 51, has stepped down from his Radio 4 programme .

"Ebola fears struck in Newark and Chicago on Tuesday as passengers arriving from West Africa failed screenings at both city's airports. A passenger who arrived to Newark International Airport, New Jersey via Brussels was taken  in an ambulance to be evaluated for the virus. That passenger, who arrived on United flight 998, was taken to University Hospital in Newark in line with the new protocols, the CDC said. Ebola fears struck in Newark, New Jersey and Chicago on Tuesday as passengers arriving from West Africa failed screenings at both city's airports. Officials take the temperature of a passenger arriving to Chicago O'Hare via West Africa on October 17 as part of the new screening protocols . A passenger landed at Newark airport on Tuesday and following a screening was taken to an area hospital to be further evaluated for Ebola . MailOnline was awaiting an update on the patient's condition from the hospital on Wednesday morning. 'During the enhanced screening process for individuals arriving to the United States from Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea, an individual was identified as reporting symptoms or having a potential exposure to Ebola,' said the CDC. The other passengers on Flight 998 were allowed through the gate and sent on their way. The CDC or state agencies will contact the other passengers on the plane if it is determined they could be at risk for the virus, ABC News reported. In Chicago, a Liberian child was stopped at O'Hare after vomiting once on the flight, reported Fox 32 Chicago. The child reported no other symptoms such as fever, but was admitted to Lurie Children's Hospital. Medical staff found no cause to test the child for Ebola. However, as per protocol, the girl was transferred to University of Chicago Medical Center for further evaluation. In a separate incident, a Liberian man reported diarrhea and nausea symptoms to screeners and was taken to Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. The man, who reported a previous bout with typhoid fever, was evaluated and - like the child-- deemed not in need of an Ebola test. Airports in New York, Washington, Chicago and Atlanta are doing the screenings along with Newark. Federal health officials say the entry screenings add another layer of protection to halt the spread of the Ebola virus that has killed thousands. Screeners will use no-touch thermometers to try to find passengers with fevers. The screenings started at New York's Kennedy International Airport on October 11. Screenings began last Thursday at Washington Dulles, Chicago O'Hare, Newark's Liberty and Hartsfield-Jackson in Atlanta, Georgia. Customs officials said about 150 people traveled daily from or through Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea to the U.S. Nearly 95 per cent of them land first at one of those five airports. As of Monday, authorities had screened 37 incoming Newark passengers, reports NorthJersey.com.

"Woolwich terror suspect Michael Adebolajo was filmed encouraging 1,500 followers to turn against Britain in a hate-filled rant on the anniversary of 9/11. Video footage unearthed by the Daily Mail shows the alleged killer addressing a crowd of young Muslims outside a mosque in north London. Standing on a platform above a large crowd, Adebolajo yells: ‘Do not be scared of the filthy kuffar [non-believers]. They are pigs.’ Scroll down for video . Holding forth: Adebolajo at the rally on the eighth anniversary of September 11 outside Harrow Central Mosque in north London . Moments after his speech – delivered in 2009 on the eighth anniversary of the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington DC that left nearly 3,000 dead – some of the crowd hurled bricks and fireworks at the police. Film of the extremist rant follows the revelation – the day after the slaughter of Drummer Lee Rigby last week – of photos of Adebolajo standing behind hate preacher Anjem Choudary outside Paddington Green police station six years ago. It prompted MPs to call for an inquiry into what MI5 knew about Adebolajo and the other terror suspect Michael Adebowale. The emergence of the video shows for the first time the prominent role Adebolajo played as an Islamic radical. It is bound to raise further questions over whether the police and the security services should have intervened earlier. Radical: Woolwich murder suspect Michael Adebolajo was pictured with bloodied hands and carrying knives in the aftermath of the attack . Last night, Michael Adebowale, 22, was charged with the murder of Drummer Lee Rigby and possession of a firearm. He will appear at Westminster Magistrate's Court today. Adebolajo is thought to remain in a serious condition and it could be weeks before he is fit enough to be questioned. Drummer Lee Rigby died from multiple stab wounds after being attacked outside Woolwich barracks last Wednesday . The video of the 28-year-old Muslim convert is one of many incendiary sermons that can be found on YouTube. During his speech outside Harrow Central Mosque in north London in 2009, Adebolajo tells the crowd not to be scared of  the police. Wearing a white skull cap and a traditional black Islamic robe, he says: ‘You are here only to please Allah. You aren’t here for any other reason.’ The demonstration was organised in response to a nearby protest by the English Defence League and a group called Stop the Islamisation of Europe. During the 80-second clip, Adebolajo says that the Prophet Muhammad fought against ‘way worse’ opposition. ‘They are pigs,’ he shouts. ‘Allah says they are worse than cattle. Do not be scared of them. And do not turn your back to them. Don’t be scared of them, or police, or the cameras.’ A witness at the rally said of Adebolajo’s address: ‘After the speech some of them started running around. An imam even came out at one stage and told the hotheads to calm down and get inside the mosque, saying that they should be praying. ‘I thought it was time for me to get out.’ The Stop Islamisation of Europe group had pledged that its protest would be peaceful and  eventually claimed it called off the protest following appeals  by police. But despite the presence of nearly 500 officers, tensions spilled over when a gang of 100 Islamic radicals – their faces covered with ski masks – chased members of far-Right groups who had turned up. It is not known whether Adebolajo was part of this group, although at one point he had urged his supporters to avoid violence and be ‘sincere to Allah’. Police arrested ten people.

"The manufacturer of DuoMax claims it is the only product in the world which can kill Ebola without damaging the human skin or being toxic to the body in anyway . A British firm which claims it makes the only chemical spray which can safely kill the Ebola virus says it has been swamped with orders. The manufacturer of DuoMax maintains it is the only product in the world which can kill Ebola without damaging the human skin or being toxic to the body in anyway. Because it is non-toxic, it can apparently be used to treat large areas as it does not irritate the skin and eyes like bleach or chlorine products . The company claims DuoMax does not break down human skin like other corrosive chemicals, which makes it susceptible to infection. Instead, it's claimed it effectively kills the virus and also stops it from spreading. The website claims the spray destroys the DNA and RNA which doesn’t allow the pathogen to reproduce or replicate. This also significantly reduces the risk of cross contamination. The chemical can be used in both cleaning products and disinfectants to stop Ebola and is already being used by Heathrow Airport, it is claimed. It comes as UK airports are stepping up their efforts to prevent the disease entering the UK, with both Heathrow and Gatwick screening for the disease. Brian Baker, founder of Bristol-based DuoMax, said the company is now in discussion with officials abroad as the global fight against the disease steps up. He said: 'We are talking to other companies in America who want to licence the product. it just has to get EPA approval first, but that is being fast-tracked for humanitarian reasons. 'We are also in contact with people in Africa are happy to send the product over for free in order to help. 'We're not providing a cure for Ebola but this is life saving and preventative technology which is currently the only form of protection.' Ebola is a spread through direct contact with bodily fluids or vomit from someone infected, meaning that any liquid left on a surface could potential lead to infection. It is so devastating that 70 per cent of cases result in death, with more than 4,500 people having already died. Mr Baker added that DuoMax could be another weapon in the fight against the disease and used as an alternative to other, more harmful chemicals. 'In these circumstances the use of bleach or high-chlorine based products can be extremely dangerous as they are corrosive, toxic and an irritant if in contact with skin. The company's website states: . On contact, DuoMax pierces the outer membrane of the pathogen and dismantles and destroys the DNA and RNA which eliminates the risk of pathogens developing resistance to the product. Alcohol only denatures the external membrane protein which does not kill the pathogen but only temporarily disables them, allowing it to regenerate with increased strength. By removing the protein, DuoMax not only kills the bacteria, but any odour will also be removed. 'This could itself create a situation in which the Ebola virus can enter the human body. 'DuoMax is completely non-toxic and non-irritant so we can use it in anything from hand sanitisers to mist sprays, which coat entire areas within buildings and prevent possible spread of the virus.' He added the chemical has already undergone extensive testing by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service at BlueTest Laboratories in Glasgow. But Paul Hunter, Professor of Health Protection at the University of East Anglia, said: 'I am sure this product will kill Ebola, but then so will almost all other disinfectants, including chlorine. 'The issue is whether the use of this disinfectant has advantages over chlorine in the real world?' Another scientist, who did not wish to be named, told MailOnline: 'A number of disinfectants have been shown to be effective disinfectants against Ebola virus - these include soap and water and bleach. 'Also, none of these disinfectants can be used to treat patients, and nor can the product highlighted on the website.' 'The individuals who have been listed as testing DuoMax would not have tested the product directly on Ebolavirus. 'Suffice to say I don’t doubt that the product would work, but needless to say that the take-home message is that any disinfectant shown to work against envelope viruses will be effective. 'Ebolavirus isn’t particularly hardy out in the environment - in fact sunlight is likely to rapidly kill it.' The chemical can be used in both cleaning products and disinfectants to stop Ebola (pictured) and is already being used by Heathrow Airport, the company says .","As it is non-toxic, DuoMax can apparently be used to treat large areas .

"An Oscar-winning screenwriter strangled a young actress with his belt during sadistic sex, she claims in a $5million lawsuit filed yesterday. Amanda Jencsik, 26, says she feared for her life during an abusive four-month relationship with Moonstruck writer John Patrick Shanley, who is 35 years her senior. Miss Jencsik alleges the 61-year-old would slap her and hold his hands over her mouth and neck during their encounters at his Manhattan apartment. 'Svengali': Amanda Jencsik, left, claims she thought John Patrick Shanley, right, was trying to kill her. Rough sex left her needing medical attention, she alleges . The writer often asked her if she felt like he was raping her, the suit says. She claims their rough sex sessions were so violent that she believed Mr Shanley was trying to kill her, and says she grew light-headed when he wrapped the belt around her neck. Brooklyn-born Miss Jencsik says she suffered severe physical and psychological trauma at the hands of the older man - but did not report him to the police 'due to her mental state', the New York Post reports. Starlet: Miss Jencsik, shown in a scene from the 2006 short I Wonder, claims her mental state meant she did not go to the police during the four-month relationship . Sal Strazzullo, the lawyer . representing Miss Jencsik, said Mr Shanley had a 'Svengali-like effect' on the aspiring actress, which kept her from severing ties. Mr Shanley, who wrote the 1987 Cher . film and also adapted the plane crash survival drama Alive in 1993, said . he knew nothing of the lawsuit when it was filed yesterday. Miss . Jencsik's statement says the pair met via Facebook in October 2009, . with Mr Shanley striking up the correspondence by asking her about her . hair colour. They did not meet in person until a dinner date in January 2010, she claims. The 26-year-old alleges that, after a second date later that month, she followed Mr Shanley to his apartment and they had sex. He invited her back the next day but was not home when she arrived, the suit says. Finest hour: Moonstruck, starring Cher, won the Oscar for best screenplay . When he eventually showed up he was drunk, Miss Jencsik alleges, and once inside he 'forcibly turned [her] over onto her stomach' and sodomised her. Though she told Mr Shanley he was hurting her he laughed, the suit says, and afterwards he complained that his sheets had been left stained with her blood and makeup. The third and final time they had sex, she says, Mr Shanley sodomised her again - this time looping the belt around her throat. After she split up with him in April 2010, Miss Jencsik claims, she was in pain but too scared to seek medical help. The lawsuit adds that it took her a whole year to approach a doctor, who diagnosed her with a bowel obstruction.

"Students once known for their lazy sleep-ins, late night partying and hangovers are now signing up to a university course to learn how to waste time on the internet. The University of Pennsylvania's Department of English will feature a new class next semester  - called Wasting Time on the Internet - in which students spend three hours a week doing nothing of value. The class aims to explore the possibility that checking Facebook and 'watching cat videos' could be used as raw material for 'compelling and emotional works of literature'. Poet and artist Kenneth Goldsmith (pictured) will run the class, which aims to channel wasting time on the internet into  raw material for creative writing. Here he pictured at his art exhibition last year in which attempted to print the internet . Students will  consider if it is possible to 'reconstruct our autobiography using only Facebook' and ponder whether their Twitter feed could be used to write a 'great novella'. The course description notes 'distraction, multi-tasking, and aimless drifting' will be mandatory. The Ivy League School's creative writing class will be run by Kenneth Goldsmith, a poet and digital artist. Mr Goldsmith is no stranger to headlines - he hit the news last year for his attempt to print out on paper the entire internet. Mr Goldsmith (pictured) wants to challenge the notion the internet is making us stupider . By asking the public to contribute to send in internet pages printed on paper, the art exhibition eventually featured ten tons of papers sent in by hundreds of people. Mr Goldsmith told the Washington Post his new university course was challenging the conventional belief that the internet is making us stupider and hoped it would place students into 'a digital or electronic twilight'. He said: 'I think the internet is making us smarter. I’m so tired of reading, every time you pick up a paper, on how bad the Web is.' Mr Goldsmith is recognized as an unusual thinker, publishing books such as 'Day' - which was the retyping of one day's New York Times edition. His other works are 'Seven American Deaths and Disaster' - which involves transcripts of press reports from days such as 9/11 and the assassination of JFK. However, last year's attempt to print out the internet was his most bold stunt to date - although in his defense, he admitted that to print off the Internet in its entirety was not feasible. However, it was not just a whim of Goldsmith's, he does have some previous work to point to in the same area. 'The advent of digital culture has turned each one of us into an unwitting archivist, hoarding endless MP3s and digital pictures and old emails,' he said.","New University of Pennsylvania class teaches students how to kill time .

They foamed at the mouth as they lay on the pavement . According to doctors four of the seven are now out of danger, but the other three are in a critical condition and may not survive. They were left homeless when their family home was demolished five years ago and were never given any compensation in return. Despite handing out posters and leaflets in a bid to garner support for their case, they failed to generate any means of supporting themselves, . Therefore all seven agreed they would head to the capital where they staged the demonstration outside the offices of official newspaper of the Communist Youth League of China. According to police, the group said that they were not prepared to carry on living without recognition for the wrong done to them, and that without death there was only dishonour. Bo Tuan works at the newspaper and was on his way into work when he saw the protest. He said: 'I heard them shouting for justice and didn't really pay much attention but then they pulled out plastic bottles and gulped down the contents before clutching their throats and collapsing to the floor. It was shocking to see, they were frothing at the mouth and choking and then all of them just lay there still.' Ambulances arrived quickly at the scene and took the victims to hospital for treatment. Beijing officials are reportedly looking into the complaint of the seven, and discussing it with local officials to find out exactly what happened with the alleged illegal land acquisition.

"A man who broke with tradition and decided to take his wife's last name when they married is fighting to get his driving license back after it was suspended when he was accused of fraud. Lazaro Sopena, from South Florida, offered to change his name following his 2011 marriage to wife Hanh Dinh in order to fulfill her wish to continue her Vietnamese family surname. Shortly after their marriage, Mr Dinh ordered a new passport and Social Security card and changed his bank account and credit cards before applying to update his drivers license. Lazaro Sopena broke with tradition . when he offered to change his name following his 2011 marriage to wife Hanh Dinh in order to fulfill her wish to continue her Vietnamese family surname . 'It was an act of love. I have no particular emotional ties to my last name,' said Mr Dinh, 40, who was born in Cuba and moved to the United States at the age of 11 in 1984. Just as is the case for newlywed women Mr Dinh was initially issued a new license after presenting his marriage certificate and paying a $20 fee. 'It was easy. When the government issues you a new passport you figure you're fine,' he said. Mr Dinh ordered a new passport and Social Security card and changed his bank account and credit cards before applying to update his drivers license. A year later he was told he had obtained it 'by fraud' But just over a year later, in December, Dinh received a letter from Florida's Department of Motor Vehicles accusing him of 'obtaining a driving license by fraud' and advising him that his license would be suspended at the end of the month. Ironically, it was addressed to Lazaro Dinh. He said he assumed it was a mistake but when he called the state DMV office in Tallahassee he said he was told he had to go to court first in order to change his name legally, a process that takes several months and has a $400 filing fee. When he explained he was changing his name due to marriage, he was told 'that only works for women,' he said. 'Apparently the state of Florida clings to the out-dated notion that treats women as an extension of a man,' said Lazaro's lawyer, Spencer Kuvin, with Cohen & Kuvin in West Palm Beach. While it was unusual for a man to seek to be considered an extension on his wife, Dinh's case raised important issues for gay marriage, he noted. 'If Lazaro isn't allowed to change his name, what is going to happen when a gay couple seeks a name change?' Only a few states have made their marriage name change policy gender neutral, Kuvin said. In Florida's case it has no law, although the DMV's website does not specify gender. According to Kuvin, 9 states enable a man to change his name upon marriage: California, New York, Hawaii, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Oregon, Iowa, Georgia and North Dakota. The Florida DMV did not respond to a request for comment. He has been told he had to go to court first in order to change his name legally, a process that takes several months and has a $400 filing fee . Following a DMV hearing, Dinh was issued a Final Order on January 14 confirming that his license had been properly suspended for fraud. He is now appealing that order but has not dared get behind the wheel. 'I don't understand. I'm being treated like a highway criminal,' said Dinh, who said he has a perfect driving record and now is struggling to carry out his job, begging his wife and friends for rides.","Lazaro Sopena took his wife Hanh Dinh's last name after 2011 marriage .

"A fit and healthy woman who took the contraceptive pill Dianette has said that it was to blame for the life-shattering stroke she suffered. Angela Macleod was a high-flying career girl who had moved to Australia to pursue a career in PR. But just months later, after being prescribed the drug, she suffered a major stroke. Angela, 40, has been left unable to use to her left arm, walk properly and suffers with poor short-term memory and moderate brain impairment. She also says that the stroke has caused havoc in her personal life – shattering her confidence and ultimately causing the breakdown of a relationship. Angela Macleod (pictured after the stroke) was prescribed the contraceptive pill Dianette after being diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome. She suffered a stroke just four months later . Doctors were unable to confirm that Dianette caused her stroke but they admitted that it probably played a role. Thirteen years on, she is angry that more isn’t being done to eradicate the pill that remains widely prescribed to women both as a form of contraception and as a treatment for acne: ‘So many women’s lives are being put at risk and it should be banned.’ In February this year the European Medicines Agency,  announced that Dianette would be investigated after it was linked to four deaths. Regulators in France have since suspended sales of the hormone treatment. In the UK, concerns about the drug were raised after the deaths of several young women, among them Shannon Deakin, 16, in 2011 who died from blood clot after taking Dianette for a month. Dianette - or Diane-35 as it’s known in France - is prescribed to more than 62,000 British women a year, usually for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a hormonal problem affecting young women which leads to multiple small ovarian cysts, irregular periods, acne and excess facial hair. In February the European Medicines Agency  announced that Dianette would be investigated after it was linked to four deaths. Regulators in France have ince suspended sales of the hormonal treatment . It is a combination of two drugs - . cyproterone (a form of the female hormone progesterone) and . ethinylestradiol (an oestrogen), which effectively suppress the effect . of testosterone. As progesterone prevents ovulation, Dianette also works as an effective contraceptive. While other oral contraceptives carry a small increased risk of blood clots - which can be dangerous and potentially fatal if they travel to the lungs or brain - the type of progesterone in Dianette means the drug has one of the highest risks of blood clots of all oral contraceptives. Cyproterone is 65 per cent more likely to cause a blood clot than levonorgestrel (a type of progesterone found in older oral contraceptive pills), according to a review of 25 studies published last year in the European Journal of Contraception And Reproductive Health Care. The French medicines agency last . month revealed Dianette is widely used as a contraceptive in France. It . is not clear what the situation is in the UK. The risk of a blood clot while taking Dianette is, however, small. Angela has been left unable to use her left arm, walk or balance properly and suffers with poor short-term memory. She blames Dianette for her stroke and is angry that it is still widely available . Around 40 of every 100,000 women on . it develop a blood clot in one year, compared with between five and ten . women in 100,000 who are not taking the drug, according to the Medicines . & Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Before her a stroke, Angela was an avid sportsperson, regularly running, skiing and even taking part in swimming competitions. She had no history of strokes in her family, had normal blood pressure, enjoyed a healthy diet and never drank to excess. Despite her fate, Angela (pictured celebrating her 40th birthday) is now managing to do more sport as she did before her stroke . She moved to Sydney in January 2001 and after some years of suffering with irregular periods she was diagnosed with PCOS. She was prescribed Dianette and suffered no immediate side effects. But one night in June 2002, Angela said she started to feel nauseous. She had enjoyed a couple of drinks and a meal out with friends and returned home sober that night. Hours later she woke up to find herself on the floor next to her bed and unable to move. ‘I didn’t know what was going on and despite an overwhelming urge to get up, I simply couldn’t move,’ she said. ‘It was terrifying.’ Angela managed to reach her mobile phone and called her then boyfriend James who lived in Brisbane at the time. ‘He could tell there was something seriously wrong because I was slurring my words, so he called my two other flatmates, who were in neighbouring rooms, to find out what was wrong. 'My flatmate came into my room, picked me up and put me on the bed. None of us for one second thought I’d had a stroke – I was only 29.’ Unsure of what had happened, Angela’s . flatmate took her to the nearest hospital. Doctors immediately knew the . cause of the symptoms. ‘My . whole left side was paralysed and the first thing the consultant said . to me was “Have you seen your mouth?”. It had drooped entirely,’ she . added. ‘I still couldn’t quite get my head round the fact I had suffered . a stroke though – it was something old people had and often they died. 'This sort of thing wasn’t meant to happen to people like me.’ Angela was also unable to recognise faces of close friends and doctors were concerned she would not be able to walk again. A raft of tests were carried out to . discover how she could have suffered a stroke – they even thought she . had a hole in her heart at one point - and although they could not . confirm any obvious reason, the doctor said that Dianette may have . played a role. Since her stroke, Angela has been reluctant to let the after effects of her stroke get in the way of enjoying her life. Here she is pictured (right) in Sri Lanka and last year she even climbed Mount Snowdon . Angela then spend the next three months in hospital, with the first six weeks in Sydney and the final in Edinburgh. She underwent intensive physiotherapy, speech therapy and since then has made a moderate recovery, although she still finds it very difficult to walk, balance, remember and still cannot use her left arm. ‘I’m managing to swim again, albeit with one arm, and I’ve even tried adapted skis so I can get myself back on the slopes. ‘But I’m angry – and I’m even angrier that the pill is temporarily banned in France and not more widely.’ Angela, who now works in the charity sector, said that the stroke has caused her to mourn the life she once had. Shannon Deakin, 16, had been taking Dianette for around four weeks before she died from an undiagnosed deep vein thrombosis . ‘You end up almost grieving yourself and to be honest I don’t think I’ve ever properly get over it – I’ll just get on with it. ‘The after-effects of a stroke affect your confidence so much and the frustration of not being able to do the things you once took for granted changes your personality. 'I try to be positive but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't sometimes sad about the way things have turned out.’ Indeed the emotional strain of the stroke caused her relationship to James to break down and she say she is not confident she will ever find another partner again. ‘I’ve tried dating websites but it can be tremendously frightening. 'You worry you’re going to be judged for having a limp and I’m a bit slower on the uptake which can make conversations more difficult.' But Angela's main concern is now to raise awareness about Dianette and stop more women using it. 'A risk is there and it shouldn't be - especially if women are prescribed it so routinely. I want it to banned.' In a statement, Bayer, the manufacturer of Dianette, said: 'Based on the currently available clinical data, the benefit-risk profile of Dianette is favourable. We will continue to provide information that supports healthcare providers and their patients in making informed decisions. 'The arterial thromboembolism (ATE) risk (which includes stroke) is slightly increased for womentaking Combined Oral Contraceptives (COCs) when compared with non-users. 'Dianette acts as a combined oral contraceptive but should not be used solely as an oral contraceptive. 'It should only be used for the treatment of severe acne if prolonged antibiotic therapy has failed or for the treatment of excess facial hair. 'The slight increase risk of ATE is a well known class effect of COCs and is clearly stated in the patient information leaflet of all COCs.'","Angela Macleod, now 40, enjoyed skiing and competitive swimming .

"It’s the bane of any avid music listeners; headphones seemingly always become tangled when they’re stored in a pocket, bag or elsewhere. But the mystery of headphones tangling might finally be solved thanks to a study that suggests a workable solution. Physicist Robert Matthews from Aston University in Birmingham says that clipping the two earbuds together, then attaching them to the end near the audio jack, will solve the problem - and he’s got the research to prove it. The mystery of how to stop headphones tangling has finally been solved (shown) Physicist Robert Matthews from Aston University in Birmingham says that clipping the two earbuds together, then attaching them to the end near the audio jack, will solve the problem - and he's got the research to prove it . In a separate study in mid-June Experts from the University of California, San Diego, investigated the probability of knotting, the type of knots formed and the dependence on string length in their study. Dorian Rayner and Douglas Smith confirmed that ‘complex knots often form within seconds’ and that stiffer wires are slightly less likely to form such mind-boggling tangles. When shaken up, the wires form coils and the loose end weaves though the other strands, creating the annoying knots. Matthews set out to investigate this so-called ‘Murphy's Law of String’. Robert Matthews of Aston University says that if string can get into knots, it will do. Building on earlier mathematical research, he concluded that string really does have a perverse tendency to knot spontaneously. He also found the longer the string is, the more likely it is to spontaneously knot. Joining the ends together dramatically reduces the probability of the string performing the manoeuvres needed to form knots, making tangling less likely, something he calls the Loop Conjecture. Murphy’s law is an adage that basically means anything that can go wrong, will go wrong. Similarly, Matthews says that any string that can get into knots, will do. To test his theory that string will always form loops he asked schools to conduct experiments, jumbling up regular parcel string to varying lengths and then repeating this process with each string having its ends joined, forming a loop. Children at Coundon Court school near Coventry performed 12,000 individual knotting tests with string ranging in size from 55 to 183 centimetres (21.6 to 72 inches). They found that the results of the experiments confirmed the ‘Loop Conjecture’, proving that simply joining the ends of your headphone cable together can dramatically cut the chance of it knotting. In his study Matthews tasked Children at Coundon Court school near Coventry to perform 12,000 individual knotting tests with string ranging in size from 55 to 183 centimetres (21.6 to 72 inches). They found that the results of the experiments confirmed the Loop Conjecture and proved his solution . ‘The study explains why your headphone cable mysteriously turns into one big jumbled mess while it’s in your bag or pocket,’ said Matthews. ‘We’ve also struck upon an easy solution - simply clipping together the two ends of the cords makes the cable less likely to form a knot - saving the frustration of having to untangle it before plugging in. ‘This was all about using hard science to tackle an everyday issue. ‘It was great to see how enthusiastic school students were to get to grips with the surprisingly complex science behind the phenomenon, and carry out experiments to study the effect and identify the solution.’ The phenomenon of spontaneous knotting also has other real-world implications. It has attracted interest from biochemists working on DNA, as this thread-like molecule also gets itself tangled, with potentially serious consequences. The new findings in Robert Matthews’ paper suggest that nature may sometimes form loops in DNA to reduce this risk. ‘This was a fun piece of research that has an immediate application that everyone can benefit from, but any implication our findings have on the fight to solve major health challenges will be even more important,’ Matthews added.","Physicist at Aston University in Birmingham found solution to tangling .

"West Ham manager Sam Allardyce insists Tottenham’s Harry Kane cannot be considered a great striker until he has proved himself for a second season. Allardyce takes his side to Spurs on Sunday for their fierce London derby where he admits Kane will be the ‘danger man.’ Kane, 21, has shocked everyone by scoring 23 goals in 36 games in all competitions this season which has put him on the verge of an England call-up. But Allardyce does not believe Spurs should get carried away with his performances until he has shown he can continue scoring when opponents are prepared for him. Sam Allardyce believes Harry Kane must continue his form into next season to be considered a 'great' The West Ham manager believes Kane (right) has the benefit of the unknown against defenders this year . ‘He’s been so brilliant,’ Allardyce said, ‘but he’s not that well known in the Premier League. It’s similar to Enner Valencia and Diafra Sakho at West Ham this season.Because they’re unknown they can surprise defenders. They’ve not been able to watch them play. ‘The test of time, if they will be great, is when everyone knows how they play if they can sustain it then. That will be the test for Kane.’ Allardyce is, however, under no illusions as to how much of a threat Kane will be in the match at White Hart Lane. Kane was rested by manager Mauricio Pochettino in Tottenham’s Europa League draw with Fiorentina and only played a part from the bench. ‘He’s the danger man,’ Allardyce added. ‘He only came on as a substitute so I can see him starting on Sunday. ‘Kane is the reason Spurs have climbed the table. His goal threat is greater than any other front man Spurs have got on their books.’ Allardyce compared Kane's situation to Diafra Sakho (left) and Enner Valencia (right) Kane (centre) is expected to start against West Ham on Sunday after starting on the bench against Fiorentina .

"A bus driver who tried to avoid a being caught out in a drugs test by using his wife's urine got busted when officials told him, 'Congratulations, you're pregnant.' The driver was selected along with colleagues from the General Transportation Authority for the standard test to detect if they had been using narcotics. Egypt is gripped by a wave of painkiller addiction, with the prescription opiate tramadol particularly popular among workers who sometimes need at least two jobs to get by. Driver: Am Egyptian bus driver who tried to avoid a being caught out in a drugs test by using his wife's urine got busted when officials told him, 'Congratulations, you're pregnant' (file photo) To avoid being rumbled for his own drug use the driver, whose name has not been revealed, tried to pass off his wife's urine as his own when his turn came to give a sample. What he didn't realise is that his wife was two months pregnant, reports the BBC's News From Elsewhere blog, citing Egyptian news website Al-Yawm al-Sabi. Tamer Amin, a presenter on Egyptian politics show Bottom Line, says officials asked the driver to confirm the sample was his own before they revealed the result. When he did, they reportedly told him: 'Congratulations, you're pregnant.' 'This story despite being funny has several lessons,' the BBC quotes Mr Amin as saying. 'First, that drugs have become available to many and have become as common as cigarettes. This is a calamity.'

More than 12,000 people die on the roads in Egypt every year, according to the World Health Organisation. That gives the country a road traffic fatality rate of 42 deaths a year per 100,000 population. One fifth of those killed are pedestrians. Drug use, meanwhile, is on the rise. The cheap, medical-grade painkiller tramadol has found massive popularity for its energising properties. In Egypt's floundering economy, the drug can ease the pain of stressed employees who work two jobs to survive and hardly have any sleep, reported Al Jazeera last year. Since the farce with the 'pregnant' bus driver, Egypt's transport authority says it will require a blood test as well as a urine test to prevent others giving fake samples.","Driver in Egypt selected to undergo drugs test by transport chiefs .

"Channel 4 was last night accused of ‘denigrating marriage’ by planning a show that will see couples marry on their first meeting. Gone will be all the romance, planning and excitement of a traditional wedding, as a panel of TV experts play match-maker to six singletons. The series, called Married At First Sight, will choose three men and three women to tie the knot, seeking to answer questions about how and why people fall in love. Unusual weddings: Six singletons are going to be introduced at the altar and immediately married off on TV . But . critics have condemned the show, in which couples will meet for the . first time at the altar, as a ‘cheap publicity stunt’ similar to . ‘getting married at 3am in Vegas’. Participants . will enter into legally binding marriages in front of their family and . friends before setting about life as a newlywed couple, all the while . followed by TV cameras. Didn't last: Greg Cordell and Carla Germaine . The . programme, planned for next spring, copies a similar experiment on . Danish TV in which only one of the three couples decided to stay married . after the show. A former . British attempt failed in 1999, when two strangers were matched up by . Birmingham radio station BRMB, agreeing to marry in order to win prizes. Former model Carla . Germaine, 23, wed sales manager Greg Cordell, 28, on air – but the pair . split just three months later and Miss Germaine went on to marry daytime . TV presenter Jeremy Kyle, who had a show on BRMB at the time. Married . At First Sight will see the six people, selected from a pool of 200, . put their love lives in the hands of psychologists, anthropologists and . theology experts, who will analyse their values, looks and personalities . to make matches. Brides . and grooms will first meet at their weddings, having never before set . eyes on one another. The show will then follow each couple for six . weeks, after which they will decide whether to stay together or go their . separate ways. Last night, . Simon Calvert, from the Christian Institute, slammed the programme as a . ‘terrible idea’, saying: ‘It’s disappointing that TV producers seem to . be in this constant race to the bottom, and this is just another idea . that denigrates marriage. New show: The programme on Channel 4 (whose London base is pictured) is based on a successful Danish programme and will see a pool of 200 people reduced to six singles willing to say 'I do' - without having met . Clearly a marriage contracted between two . people who barely know each other, who are doing it solely for the sake . of a TV programme, is not showing proper respect for the institution. ‘Marriage . is meant to be for life and contracting a marriage as part of a TV show . ranks somewhere alongside getting married at 3am in Vegas ... it’s . horrible for broadcasters to be experimenting with people’s lives in . this way.’ Wedding planner . Melanie Helen said: ‘The idea of simply plucking two people off the . street and getting married without meeting is bizarre. Marriage should . be between two people who love each other unconditionally, who know each . other inside out and wish to make that life-long commitment.’ Channel 4’s chief creative officer Jay Hunt said she hoped to ‘take on Britain’s reputation as the divorce capital of Europe’. Marriage in the UK is at an all-time low, with 15.7million adults not in a romantic relationship. A Channel 4 spokesman said: ‘Rather than undermining the importance of marriage this is an acknowledgment that statistically the institution of marriage has a vital role to play in creating an environment where committed and long-lasting relationships can develop.’","Six singletons will be introduced at the altar and immediately married off .

"The charity Amnesty has called for laws banning people from buying or selling sex to be scrapped (picture posed by model) Laws that ban people from buying or selling sex should be scrapped because they breach their human rights, according to Amnesty International. A policy document drawn up by the charity claims that prostitutes, pimps and men who buy sex are simply ‘exercising their autonomy’ and should be allowed to do so ‘free from government interference’. The proposal, which also bizarrely compares prostitutes to coal miners and domestic servants, was uncovered by writer Julie Bindel. It has now sparked a major row within the organisation, which is best known for its attempts to free political prisoners and campaigns against torture. Last night critics said Amnesty was ‘losing the plot’ with one former member accusing the organisation of ‘betraying women’s rights’. They told the Mail: ‘We do not solve the problems for women in the developing world by encouraging them to be prostitutes. Who benefits from that? The men. Prostitution is a form of exploitation and abuse – not a choice.’ The paper, which is titled Decriminalisation of Sex Work: Policy Background Document, states: ‘Amnesty International is opposed to the criminalisation or punishment of activities related to the buying or selling of consensual sex between adults. ‘The criminalisation of voluntary sex between adults, whether for direct monetary gain or otherwise, threatens the rights to health, non-discrimination, equality, privacy, and security of person.’ Laws against prostitution undermine the right to ‘freely chosen gainful work’ and any legislation that targets men who pay for sex will leave prostitutes particularly vulnerable to ‘violence and abuse’, the document claims. It also says countries should support the right of prostitutes to ‘freedom of association’ – thought to refer to groups of prostitutes setting up brothels. The document goes on to say: ‘Amnesty International understands the imperfect context in which individuals choose to become sex workers (or miners or foreign domestic workers.) ‘Human rights principles require policymakers to value the voices of those who are directly affected by inequality and discrimination. ‘We believe that governments should not be devaluing [prostitutes’] decisions and choices or criminalising the contexts in which they live their lives.’ Laws against prostitution undermine the right to 'freely chosen gainful work' the document claims (pictured posed by model) One of the other justifications given in the paper is that some disabled people struggle to form normal sexual relationships – and so need to see prostitutes for the sake of their health. The proposal was drawn up by Amnesty International’s headquarters and will be discussed by members around the world – including UK branches of the charity. The proposal is due to be announced in Amnesty’s magazine, which is distributed to all its members, with a vote expected at the AGM in April. An Amnesty spokesman said: ‘We are aware this is a very sensitive issue and that’s why we are canvassing opinion and encouraging discussion with our members around the world . ‘We are only at the beginning of an extensive process of consultation.’ The revelations are the latest damaging blow to the charity, which was founded in the 1960s as a campaign group dedicated to freeing political prisoners. Last year a Panorama documentary suggested the charity had ignored the advice of its own lawyers by handing its secretary general Irene Khan a £533,000 payoff and giving her deputy £300,000 back in 2009. In 2010 the organisation was accused of losing its moral compass – after a senior member of staff quit in protest over its links with Islamist pressure groups.","Charity says people should be allowed to 'exercise their autonomy' when it comes to buying or selling sex .

"The tomb of an unknown ruler has been discovered, which could help archaeologists find more lost Ancient Egyptian pharaohs. Experts identified the tomb of Senebkay by an inscription on the wall of his burial chamber, which was unearthed at the Abydos archaeological site, near the city of Sohag, Egypt. It is the first time that any trace of the pharaoh has been found. Archaeologists from the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities and the University of Pennsylvania identified the tomb of Senebkay by drawings on the wall of his burial chamber (pictured), which was unearthed in the Abydos archaeological site . Ali Asfar, head of antiquities for the Egyptian government said that only fragments of the name have previously been seen on an ancient list of Egyptian rulers. ‘This was the first time in history to discover the king,’ he told NBC News. It is thought that Senebkay lived around 3,650 years ago at a time when rulers battled for power before the rise of Egypt’s New Kingdom in 1550 BC. Painted decoration in the burial chamber of Senebkay is pictured left. Archaeologists examine Senebkay's skeleton on the right. While his body was mummified, it is thought Senebkay's remains were pulled apart by robbers looking for treasures, who also plundered the pharaoh's tomb . The lost tomb was discovered by a team of . archaeologists from the University of Pennsylvania, who came across it . while excavating the tomb of pharaoh Sobekhotep I, who was buried . nearby. Senebkay’s final resting place appears to have been plundered because the skeleton is pulled apart, but it is estimated that the ruler was aged around 45 when he died and measured five ft 10 inches. Josef Wegner of the university, who led the dig, believes the new find could lead to the discovery of more pharaohs and could help piece together the gaps in knowledge about the rulers of Ancient Egypt. The lost tomb (pictured) was discovered by a team of archaeologists from the University of Pennsylvania, who came across it while excavating the tomb of pharaoh Sobekhotep I, who was buried nearby . The tomb was discovered at the Abydos site (pictured) near Sohag in Egypt and could lead to more royal tombs being unearthed. Last week it was announced that the same archaeological team had uncovered the Tomb of pharaoh Sobekhotep I . ‘We discovered an unknown king plus a lost dynasty. It looks likely that all of the 16 kings are all buried there,’ he said. ‘We now have the tomb for first or second king of this dynasty. There should be a whole series of the others.’ Describing the moment the archaeologists came across the tomb, he explained that they found the entrance first, which led them down to the burial chamber, made of limestone and painted with cartouches of the pharaoh. Last week it was announced that a vast 3,800-year-old quartzite sarcophagus belongs to a little-known 13th dynasty king, Sobekhotep I. It was discovered by an international team of researchers who deciphered inscriptions to link it to its owner . ‘In Abydos there is lots of sand and everything is deeply buried. You can dig day after day, and then this….We were standing there looking dumbfounded at the colourful wall decoration,’ he said. While robbers had stripped the tomb, a re-used burial chest had the engraving of the ruler’s name on the wood. The experts said the re-use of materials suggests a lack of stability and wealth at a time when the kingdom was fragmented. A huge pink tomb of an ancient Egyptian pharaoh was identified approximately one year after it was discovered, it was announced last week. The vast 3,800-year-old quartzite sarcophagus belongs to a little-known 13th Dynasty king called Sobekhotep I, according to the Egyptian government. The 60 tonne sarcophagus was discovered by the same team of archaeologists at the Abydos site and . The same team or researchers from the University of Pennsylvania and Egypt’s Antiquities Ministry deciphered stone pieces inscribed with the pharaoh’s name, which also show him sitting on a throne, to link the tomb to its owner. ‘He is likely the first who ruled Egypt at the start of the 13th Dynasty during the second intermediate period,’ the minister said. King Sobekhotep I is thought to have ruled the 13th Dynasty but little is known about him and his kingdom or even when the dynasty began exactly, which makes the discovery particularly important. Historians believe that it began sometime between 1803BC and 1781BC but they are keen to establish a precise date. He is thought to have ruled for almost five years, which was ‘the longest rule at this time’ according to ministry official Ayman El-Damarani.","University of Pennsylvania and the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities experts identified the tomb by an inscription on the wall of his burial chamber .

"He is renowned for his skills on the pitch, but now Cristiano Ronaldo has revealed his talents stretch further than football. The highest paid footballer in the world couldn't resist the chance to show off after a Japanese manufacturer asked him to promote their facial exerciser ball. Ronaldo, 29, who plays for Real Madrid, appears in a bizarre 30-second video advertising the Facial Fitness Pao which involves nodding excitedly while biting down on a ball. But Ronaldo does appear to have some standards, and instead of putting it in his mouth, he gives it his winning grin and does a few kick-ups before letting the others do the hard work. The product description on the company’s website says the movement will exercise your facial muscles and keep your smile bright – just like Ronaldo’s. The video, which has been uploaded to YouTube, has already had nearly one million hits. Ronaldo, who celebrated in May when his team landed the Holy Grail of ‘La Decima’ – their tenth European championship, is no stranger to scoring advertising deals. Earlier this year he appeared on the front cover of Vogue with nothing but his girlfriend Irina Shayk to cover his modesty. The winning smile: Cristiano Ronaldo gives the facial muscle exerciser his blessing in the bizarre video . The best player on the planet can't resist showing off a few ball skills . Unlike the other people in the video who put the facial exerciser in their mouths, Ronaldo refuses . But the sex god image he has so carefully maintained may have gone out of the window in this embarrassing video. Still, there’s no denying he’s got brand appeal. British magazine SportsPro listed him as the fourth most marketable athlete of 2014. He takes home around £17m every year through his salary from Real Madrid and endorsements with big-name companies including Armani and Nike. Next week he will return to grandstanding his ball skills on the pitch, when Real Madrid take on Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup in Cardiff.

"Smartphone cameras are getting more advanced all the time, but now a DIY fan has revealed how crafty iPhone owners can make a microscope for their handset for under $10. Using a block of wood, some plexiglass and the lens from a laser pointer, a video shows how users can make a microscope with 175x magnification for an iPhone. Once the project is completed, the smartphone can be used to take photos of things as small as the nuclei of plant cells as well as for macro photography projects. Scroll down for video . One crafty DIY fan has revealed how to make a microscope for an iPhone using a few nuts and bolts, a piece of wood and plexiglass plus a torch and a lens taken from a laser pointer . According to crafting website Instructables, the DIY microscope can be made in just 20 minutes and costs under $10, excluding the price of the smartphone. The lens for the microscope comes from a cheap laser pointer and the website explains how it can be freed from its casing and placed in the correct way against the camera lens of the iPhone using a hairpin. It is this lens that creates the larger field of view and can itself be used to take macro shots of insects, for example, just pressed against the phone's camera lens. The lens for the microscope (pictured) comes from a cheap laser pointer and Instructables explains how it can be placed in the correct way againt the camera lens of the iPhone using a hairpin. It is this lens that creates the larger field of view and can itself be used to take macro shots just pressed to the phone's camera lens . However, to create the microscope, a 'rig' must be built to keep the phone steady and it is made from a sheet of plywood for a base and a couple of pieces of plexiglass to make the camera stage as well as the place to put the specimens. They are held in the correct position by carriage bolts and wing nuts. The assembly of the rig requires basic DIY skills, including the use of a drill, as well as a few nuts and bolts. A hole must be drilled in the camera stage just large enough for the lens to sit in and it is vital it is as close as possible to the camera. According to Yoshinok, who penned the original how-to, plants cells can be seen really clearly under the home-made microscope. This is an image of red onion cells taken using an iPhone 4S with the DIY microscope attachment . Another hole is made directly below the lens for the light source - a small torch or LED light - and then the drilled components can be assembled into the final rig. Full instructions of how to put the rig together as well as the dimensions of components are available on the Instructables website. According to Yoshinok, who penned the original how-to and lives in Iowa, plants cells can be seen very clearly under the DIY microscope. The website claims these simple parts costing under $10 are all that is needed to create the microscope - as well as 20 minutes of spare time, some DIY know-how and the smartphone .","A video shows how users can make a microscope with 175x magnification for under $10 that is built for an iPhone .

"A Brooklyn jury has awarded more than $500,000 to a man who sued the city for a broken ankle he suffered during an arrest for shoplifting. The jury awarded Kevin Jarman $510,000 on Wednesday for the injury. Jarman, 50, had filed the suit after pleading guilty to shoplifting at a Queens Pathmark supermarket in 2011. Jarman has also received other payouts from the city, according to The New York Post. Kevin Jarman has been awarded $500,000 by a New York jury after breaking his ankle while shoplifting (library image) In 2005, he sued the NYPD for false arrest after a drug sale charge was dropped. The city settled for $15,000. Last month, the city settled for $20,000 after Jarman sued police for false arrest in another drug case. The city's Law Department says it intends to challenge Wednesday's verdict. On the day of Jarman's arrest for shoplifting, he fell over and broke his ankle after Police Sergeant Samuel Morales yanked on his handcuffs. Jarman, who is six foot two, complained that the cuffs were too tight, but instead of loosening them, Morales pulled them, causing the fall. Jarman was admitted to Jamaica Hospital, where he spend nine days recovering. Despite the jury awarding Jarman the large payout just hours after closing arguments, law enforcements will battle the verdict. 'There's no rhyme or reason for the figure they came up with. These guys are getting huge paydays, and for what? A broken ankle? Half a million? To a shoplifter? It's getting out of control', an officer told the Post.","Kevin Jarman pleaded guilty to shoplifting at a Brooklyn supermarket in 2011 .

"The union baron accused of Commons seat rigging is at the centre of a new scandal after a former mistress who gave birth to his child when he was married was given a top job in his union. Unite union leader Len McCluskey’s ex-lover, Jennie Formby, was last month given the £75,000-a-year post of Unite political director, with the task of getting more union supporters picked as Labour Parliamentary candidates. She won the job after leading the public defence of Left-winger Mr McCluskey, dubbed ‘Red Len’ by critics, who was accused of trying to rig a Labour selection contest in Falkirk, Scotland, for another union ally and friend, Karie Murphy. Unite union leader Len McCluskey, pictured right, . has given a key £75,000-a-year job to Jennie Formby, pictured left, who gave birth to his lovechild in 1991 . The disclosure is deeply embarrassing . for Labour leader Ed Miliband, who is desperate to counter Tory claims . he is in the unions’ pockets. He has to face Ms Formby at meetings of . Labour’s national executive council. Ms Formby effectively acts as Mr . McCluskey’s spokesman at the NEC. At a meeting, she challenged Mr . Miliband, who was present, head-on over his attempt to weaken Labour’s . ties with their union paymasters. Unite helped Mr Miliband become Labour . leader in 2010 and has since given Labour £7.5 million from . subscriptions paid by its 1.4 million members. Last night a Unite . spokesman said: ‘All appointments are authorised and ratified by the . union’s executive council.’ He declined to comment further. Certificate: How the birth of Jennie Formby's child was recorded in 1991 . Official documents show that in 1991, . Ms Formby gave birth to a child by Mr McCluskey, who was married at the . time and living in a union-subsidised home, while his wife stayed in his . native Liverpool. The Unite general secretary is named as the father. The disclosure that Ms Formby has been . given such a powerful and lucrative post in the union, follows a series . of allegations against Mr McCluskey and his union and Labour Party . allies, including cronyism. Union insiders fear the disclosure of his love child with Ms Formby will lead to claims of a conflict of interest. A senior Unite official told The Mail . on Sunday: ‘The existence of McCluskey and Formby’s child is known to a . handful of senior figures in the union but not to its members. Many earn . a pittance compared to McCluskey and Formby and will be shocked nobody . told them about the connection. It helps critics who say the union is . run by a clique.’ Although Ms Formby’s appointment was . the decision of Unite’s executive committee, a well-placed source said: . ‘With most senior appointments like this, the general secretary makes it . clear what he wants and usually gets his way.’ Union officials say that while Ms . Formby is widely regarded as able, her closeness to Mr McCluskey has . been an asset. ‘She has always enjoyed strong support from Len and he is . so dominant in Unite you can’t get far without it,’ said one. Mr McCluskey receives pay and perks . worth around £135,000 a year from Unite. The disclosure of his love . child with his union’s political director is the latest episode in the . Labour seat-rigging row. The Unite leader is accused of . breaking Labour rules to try to get union-backed candidates picked to . contest Parliamentary seats for Labour. Leader Ed Miliband has handed to . police an internal report into claims of foul play by Mr McCluskey, 62, . and his supporters in a selection battle in Falkirk. It is thought the affair between Mr . McCluskey and Ms Formby started when they met through their union . activities. In the 1990s, both worked for the Transport and General . Workers Union. The union merged with Amicus to form Unite in 2007, and . three years later Mr McCluskey became general secretary. Ms Formby also worked her way through . the ranks at the TGWU. But her big break came last month when she won . the key post of political director. Predecessor Steve Hart was forced . out in a power struggle. Insiders say some Unite officials . believed Mr Hart had become ‘too close’ to Ed Miliband. It is not a . criticism that has been made of Ms Formby, 53, a steadfast supporter of . Mr McCluskey. Three years after they had a child, Mr . McCluskey divorced wife Ann. But instead of setting up home with Ms . Formby, he moved another lover, Paula Lace, into his union-subsidised . London home. Ms Formby (then known as Sandle, her maiden name), married . Frederick Formby in 2004 and took his name. A secret to all but a . handful of close friends, her relationship with McCluskey is formally . recorded on the birth certificate of the child they had together 22 . years ago. It shows that in December 1991, Ms . Formby gave birth to a child by Mr McCluskey. The father’s ‘name and . surname’ is recorded as ‘Leonard David McCluskey’ – Mr McCluskey’s full . name; his ‘place of birth’ is given as ‘Liverpool,’ the union leader’s . home city; and under ‘occupation,’ it states ‘trade union official’. The father’s address is listed as . ‘Wellfield Avenue, London N10.’ Mr McCluskey bought the home with a . cut-price union loan. He has since sold it. Ms Formby is listed on the . register as Jennifer Sandle and is also described as a ‘union official’. The child was given the middle name ‘McCluskey’ in honour of its . father. The Mail on Sunday has decided not to publish the full details of the child, now an adult, provided in the same register. In her new role at Unite, Ms Formby . will be expected to get as many pro-union supporters picked as Labour . Parliamentary candidates as possible. Unite has a list of 40 candidates . it hopes will enter the Commons in the next Election, due in 2015. It is certain to bring her into close . contact with Mr McCluskey, who is known to take a close interest in the . selection of such candidates. Allegations that Unite resorted to . cheating to try to get one of Mr McCluskey’s allies, union official . Karie Murphy, selected as Labour candidate in Falkirk sparked a battle . between McCluskey and Ed Miliband. Mr McCluskey’s critics say the . Falkirk scandal has shown the union is plotting to increase its . stranglehold over Labour. Mr McCluskey and Ms Formby claim they . are the victims of a plot by former supporters of Tony Blair, who want . to cut the Party’s ties with the unions. Tattoo: President of the GMB Mary Turner . Ed Miliband was forced to sit in silence as Britain’s most senior woman union leader read the riot act to him for trying to curb the power of trade unions over the Labour party. Former dinner lady Mary Turner, president of the GMB, told him Keir Hardie, founder of the Labour Party, would be horrified by the way Mr Miliband was treating the unions. Mrs Turner, who once had her union’s name emblazoned on her arm, rounded on Mr Miliband at the party’s ruling national executive committee  last week. ‘Keir Hardie would be turning in his grave if he knew what you were doing,’ Mrs Turner told Mr Miliband, according to witnesses. ‘You should be proud of the historic link with unions and fight to defend it.’ Witnesses say Mr Miliband was visibly shocked by the onslaught from Mrs Turner, whose union pays £1.4 million a year to Labour. Her attack followed his attempt to curb union influence after claims Unite tried to rig a Labour Parliamentary selection contest in Falkirk, Scotland. Last year, Mrs Turner also gave Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls a dressing down for refusing to reverse George Osborne’s public sector pay hiatus.","Married Unite union leader Len McCluskey fathered child with Jennie Formby .

"Senior bishops have raised the prospect of asking the Queen to dissolve the Church of England’s ‘Parliament’, the General Synod, if it continues to oppose the creation of women bishops. The unprecedented proposal was made in a confidential meeting chaired by the Archbishop of Canterbury last week and reflects Church leaders’ frustration with the Synod for narrowly defeating legislation in November to allow women priests to become bishops. The House of Bishops unveiled fresh plans on Friday to push through the historic reforms within two years and is preparing for a battle with traditionalists. The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby held a confidential meeting last week about the issue . The Archbishops of Canterbury and York are due to urge the Synod, when it meets in July, to accept a law that will allow women to be consecrated. But some bishops fear that opposition can be overcome only by dissolving the Synod and electing new members who are more sympathetic to reform. One senior traditionalist said last night: ‘It seems the new Archbishop is determined to steam-roll this through, but if he is not careful he will be risking another disaster.’ The Archbishop is to urge the Synod to accept a law that women should be concentrated in July . As in Parliament, elections to the Synod are normally every five years, but the Archbishops can in theory seek an early dissolution. To take this step, they would have to petition the Queen, the Supreme Governor of the Church of England, who has the power to force new elections. Sources said, however, that the idea had not ‘gained traction’ with the majority of bishops because they were confident the Synod would not be able to defeat the motion again. In November, the reform was defeated despite widespread support by only a few votes in the House of Laity, one of the three houses of the Synod alongside the Houses of Bishops and of Clergy. Sources are confident that the Synod, (pictured) will defeat the motion as it did in November . The fallout was highly damaging to the Church’s credibility and MPs have threatened to impose women bishops by passing legislation in Parliament if the Church fails to resolve the crisis. The Synod can reject the Archbishops’ proposals in July, but observers said the mood is now strongly in favour of introducing women bishops as quickly as possible and that the traditionalists will try only to gain favourable terms.","Archbishop of Canterbury chaired a confidential meeting last week .

"One of Britain’s best teenage  sailors has been found dead a day after celebrating her birthday. The body of Jessica Eales was  discovered in woodland near her  home in the New Forest, just weeks after she represented Great Britain in a youth world championships. The straight-A student, who lived near Lymington in Hampshire, had  spent her 17th birthday with friends from her sailing club. Talented: Jess Eales, 17, from Lymington, Hampshire, was found dead in woodland weeks after representing Great Britain in the World Youth Sailing Championships . She had posted messages on Facebook the day before, saying how she was looking forward to seeing them. The group hired a rigid inflatable boat, which they took out on the Solent. Jessica . also uploaded a smiling photograph of herself the day she died, which . has now been ‘liked’ by 157 people on the social media site. The teenager’s cousin, Misty Eales, 24, who lives nearby, said: ‘It looks like she had a lovely day out. ‘She . posted photos online and was laughing in every one – she looked really . happy. Jess was just a lovely person and she did so well, representing . Britain in the sailing in Portugal. Accolades: The teenager was hugely successful on the British sailing circuit, winning gold at the Youth National Championships in Weymouth earlier this year . ‘She was good at art, at school … just really clever.’ Her body was discovered in Sway, near the family home, at around 9.30am last Thursday. Friends and family yesterday refused to discuss the circumstances surrounding her death. Quick progress: She was a student at Brockenhurst College in the New Forest and only learned to sail in 2009 . But . a Hampshire Police spokesman confirmed it was not being treated as . suspicious and they are not looking to speak to anyone else in relation . to it.

"Understanding: Nearly half of the British public believe there should be special pleading for a man sent to forfeit is life overseas . The Chief of the Defence Staff says ‘murder is murder’ and there must be no special pleading on behalf of British Marine Sergeant Alexander Blackman when he is sentenced today for murdering an injured insurgent in Afghanistan. But General Sir Nicholas Houghton could not be more wrong. I believe it is imperative there should be special pleading for a fighting man our government sent into battle with orders to forfeit his life if called upon to do so. Some 47 per cent of the British public understand this, according to opinion polls, and want leniency to be shown. No other human activity is comparable with war, and Sgt Blackman’s killing of a wounded Taliban prisoner following an attack on a patrol base in Helmand province is not comparable with gang murders on the streets of Britain. The court martial having delivered its guilty verdict (two of his comrades  were acquitted), there will be pressure to make an example of Sgt Blackman so that the remnants of an unpopular war can be airbrushed away and the national conscience soothed. Yesterday’s decision to allow the man to be named (after the lifting of a High Court ban that had meant he had previously only been known as ‘Marine A’) will be seen with great anger by many in the Armed Forces. Blackman may be guilty of murder, but identifying him has placed him and his family and friends, at risk of reprisal attacks from Islamist extremists. You only have to read the horrendous evidence from the trial of those charged with the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby in Woolwich to understand the terrible dangers our soldiers face, on duty and off, at home and abroad. All my experience as an infantry soldier, particularly my time commanding British Forces in Afghanistan, tells me the  military court should resist any political pressure. Instead, the court martial members should consider the mitigation for Sgt Blackman’s crime. It could be summed up by that great British soldier, Field Marshal Montgomery. His view was that a soldier reflected the national character of his country — influenced ‘by his home, his upbringing and his historical traditions’. In his days, these values were patriotism, chivalry, honour, discipline and self-sacrifice. Back then, soldiers were regular church-goers. But the past 30 years have seen greater and more rapid change in every aspect of our society than at any time in human history. Soldiers today rarely see the inside of a church and are brought up on movies dripping in gratuitous, unrestrained blood and gore. Scroll down for video . Potential cause: Those close to Sergeant Blackman believe his loss played a part in the 'moment of madness' that ended in the execution of a Taliban fighter . It is the influence of this less moral culture — condoned by successive governments pursuing an agenda of secularism and multi-cultural moral relativism — which now determines how a soldier acts under extreme pressure. General Houghton expects ‘immaculate standards of our people’, and the Royal Marines train their men in the laws of war, professional ethics and the standards and values required of them. But Montgomery explains that ‘no matter what may be instilled into him in the Army, the soldier will retain his individual character, which he derives from his environment’. We know of the extraordinary pressures on Sgt Blackman and his comrades throughout their violent tour in 2011. They endured almost daily Taliban attacks. The Marines saw 20 of their men killed or maimed during the six-month tour, and two of Sgt Blackman’s closest comrades lost their lives in an explosion. The Taliban decorated trees with body parts of the Marines’ fallen comrades. Sticking rigidly to the rules of war against an enemy that flouts even the most basic rules of human decency can only be sustained by the utmost in Christian morality. The argument put forward by Sgt Blackman’s prosecutor, that his actions were not a ‘heat of the moment’ battlefield killing, betrays a lack of understanding of the cumulative pressures of combat. These do not dissipate moments after a bloody fire-fight has ended. It can take months for a soldier to get back to normal. Some never do. In morale-sapping campaigns that . politicians have failed to prosecute with the commitment required to . win, many of our soldiers and Marines have endured far longer periods of . fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq than their forebears even in the two . world wars. The video . unearthed of the incident that led to the trial has been portrayed as a . sickening narrative of abuse, foul language and inhumanity. But it is . rather the product of the Twitter, Facebook and YouTube generation for . whom nothing is deemed real unless filmed. It’s a habit encouraged by . broadcasters such as the BBC, whose popular Our War series relies almost . entirely on head-cam footage. Stress: The Marines saw 20 of their men killed or maimed during the six-month tour, and two of Sgt Blackman¿s closest comrades lost their lives . In training, Marines are inculcated with the importance of constantly living up to their reputation for toughness and machismo. Knowing video footage might be subjected to merciless criticism by their mates, I believe the behaviour of the Marines was driven by a need to maintain their ‘street cred’, and avoid being observed ‘weakly’ affording decent treatment to a brutal enemy. Given as evidence to the court martial, video footage showed Sgt Blackman shooting the Afghan prisoner with a 9mm pistol, and saying: “There, shuffle off this mortal coil . . .It’s nothing you wouldn’t do to us.” He was probably mimicking the dialogue of an action film. Sgt Blackman — a Marine with an apparently exemplary service record in Iraq — was a man who volunteered again and again to put his life on the line for his country. The question the court martial must decide today is: was he a strong leader pushed beyond his endurance who reacted in a way society had conditioned him to react? The Chief of the Defence Staff is right to expect immaculate standards from our fighting men. In my experience, despite everything, we usually get those standards right. But when one of our troops is found wanting amid the horrors of the battlefield, he should not be thrown to the wolves. For us to expect Sgt Alexander Blackman, when under extreme battle stress, unequivocally to behave by the more rigorous moral standards of a previous age when the rest of society no longer does is cowardly and itself immoral.","Nearly half of the British public want leniency to be shown .

"Daimler, the maker of Mercedes-Benz and Smart cars, has announced that it will start selling a self-driving car by 2020. It is thought the car will be able to drive on its own in most situations but will still hand control back to the driver during difficult situations such as dealing with traffic lights. The move could help Daimler regain its position as the leading luxury car market from its rival BMW. Scroll down for video... It is thought the car, which will be able to drive on its own in most situations, will still hand control back to the driver during difficult situations such as dealing with traffic lights . ‘We want to be the first to launch autonomous functions in production vehicles. You can be sure: we will accomplish that in this decade,’ said Daimler head of development Thomas Weber. The technology featured at this week's Frankfurt car show but won’t come to market for another 10 years. The German car maker has been working on improving its driverless technology over the past few years and recently became the world’s first car manufacturer to demonstrate autonomous driving in rural and urban traffic. Last month, a Mercedes Benz S 500 Intelligent Drive research vehicle, drove autonomously through a 100-kilometre-long route from Mannheim to Pforzheim in Germany. Last month, a Mercedes Benz S 500 Intelligent Drive research vehicle drove autonomously through a 100-kilometre-long route from Mannheim to Pforzheim in Germany . The driverless S-Class was able to deal with some difficult situations involving traffic lights, roundabouts, pedestrians, cyclists and trams . A particular challenge for autonomous vehicles is the way in which they communicate and interact with other cars. Coming to an agreement with an oncoming vehicle on who should proceed first around an obstruction is something that requires a very great deal of situational analysis. 'Where a human driver might boldly move forward into a gap, our autonomous vehicle tends to adopt a more cautious approach,' said  Prof Ralf Herrtwich, head of driver assistance and suspension systems at Daimler. 'This sometimes results in comical situations, such as when, having stopped at a zebra crossing, the vehicle gets waved through by the pedestrian – yet our car stoically continues to wait, because we failed to anticipate such politeness when we programmed the system.' The research vehicle was equipped with production-based sensors for the project. Developers taught the technology platform to know where it is, what it sees and how to react autonomously. With the aid of its highly automated 'Route Pilot', the vehicle was able to negotiate its own way through dense urban and rural traffic. The driverless S-Class was also able to deal with some difficult situations involving traffic lights, roundabouts, pedestrians, cyclists and trams. Existing technology already partly automates driving to assist during, for instance, traffic jams, by maintaining a safe distance with the car in front. In July, the UK government said it will allow driverless cars on public roads for the first time during trials to take place this year. During the ground-breaking road tests, an expert will have to remain in the driving seat. Scientists at Oxford University are working with Nissan in Sunderland to create ‘robotcars’ that can drive themselves independently using details of the road they are driving on stored in on-board software. The Nissan self-drive Leaf electric car is controlled by an iPad, and the Oxford team behind it claim the technology could be installed in mainstream cars as a £60 option. The future: Most big car-makers are already developing self-drive technology and incorporating elements of it into cars already on the road . Cameras and lasers built into its chassis map a 3D model of its surroundings when it is driven manually, which is fed into a computer stored in the boot. The car can then ‘remember’ routes. It prompts the driver via an iPad on the dashboard to engage the autopilot and, at a touch of the screen, the car assumes control. A laser at the front scans 164ft ahead 13 times per second for obstacles, such as pedestrians, cyclists, or other cars in an 85-degree field of view. If it senses an obstacle, it slows and comes to a controlled stop. The driver can tap the brake pedal to regain control of the vehicle from the computer. Sweden’s Volvo, Vauxhall’s U.S. parent General Motors, and Germany’s Volkswagen are also working on the technology.","Car will be able to hand control back to the driver in difficult situations .

"David Cameron made the extraordinary claim yesterday that North Korea could attack Britain.

David Cameron described dictator Kim Jong-Un's behaviour as 'worrying and threatening' But his claims were immediately . disputed by experts who say North Korea does not have missiles that can . reach Europe –  and cannot mount nuclear warheads on them either. And they sparked comparisons with the claims made by Tony Blair to justify invading Iraq ten years ago. Mr Blair produced a ‘dodgy dossier’ on Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction. It falsely claimed that . Iraq could hit British targets with chemical weapons in just 45 minutes . and was used to fuel the rush to war. Hackers broke into Pyongyang’s social media sites yesterday and posted a picture showing leader Kim Jong-un with a pig’s snout. North Korea uses its Uriminzokkiri website’s Twitter feed and Flickr stream to send out regime propaganda, such as photos of Kim Jong-un with military chiefs. But as tensions rose on the Korean peninsula, these halted yesterday. Instead, one showed a picture of Kim’s face with a pig-like snout and a drawing of Mickey Mouse on his chest. Underneath, the text read: ‘Threatening world peace with ICBMs and Nuclear weapons/Wasting money while his people starve to death.’ Another posting said, ‘We are Anonymous’ – the name of a hacker activist group. A statement purporting to be from the hackers claimed that they had compromised 15,000 user records on Uriminzokkiri.com and other sites.

That is a real concern.’ Maintaining the UK’s submarine-based . Trident nuclear deterrent was a necessary ‘insurance policy against the . risks that there are in the world’, he said. But international security experts last night cast doubt on his extraordinary claim about the threat posed by North Korea. They said Pyongyang’s most powerful . weapon – test-fired in December – has a range of 3,700 miles. It can . reach no further than Alaska, and certainly not the UK. The poster here reads 'safeguard to the death' as the North Korean army said it had approval to attack the United States with its nuclear weapons . Mark Fitzpatrick, director of nuclear . non-proliferation and disarmament at the International Institute for . Strategic Studies think-tank, said: ‘The Prime Minister was certainly . correct as to the growing nuclear threat from North Korea and the . uncertainties of the future. ‘But North Korea does not have any . missile capabilities that could hit Britain and it is difficult to . envision circumstances when North Korea ever would want to attack the UK . even if they could.’ Labour MP Paul Flynn said: ‘North . Korean missiles would be lucky to reach South Korea given their previous . record. There’s as much truth in this claim as there was in the claim . that Iraq could hit British interests in 45 minutes. ‘This is clearly utter fiction and wild exaggeration. It is desperate scaremongering.’ While experts do not believe North . Korea has the capacity to strike at the US mainland, American bases in . South Korea, Japan and the Pacific island of Guam could be within range . of Pyongyang’s conventional missiles. North Koreans hold posters of their previous leaders, Kim Il-sung, left, Kim Jong-Il .

"It is every shopper's dream - a car that can automatically drop you at your favourite store, go and park itself, and then come to meet you when you're done. Car firm Audi says its self driving technology, revealed at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, could be commonplace in a decade. The modified Audi A7 was put through its paces in the car park of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Las Vegas, ferrying journalists around the cavernous car park. Scroll down for video . Audi's self parking A7 being tested in Las Vegas. It uses sensors on the car and in the car park to drive itself . The car is controlled via a special app - and can start itself and come to meet owners at the touch of a button . 'Imagine you are at a shopping center and you want the car to pick you up,' said Annie Lien, Audi Senior Engineer, told ABC News. 'That's exactly what it will do. 'If I press the pickup button, this car will turn itself on and start driving, and it will stop right in front of your doorstep.' The system works using a combination of sensors on the car and car park. This allows computer systems in the carpark to tell the car where there are spaces. The modified A7 parking itself inside a Las Vegas hotel . Audi has unveiled a self-parking car at the Computer Electronics show - and says it can even come and meet owners when they are finished shopping . For the Las Vegas test, the car only moved in special 'pedestrian free zones', but Audi is also developing anti collision technology so it could one day be used in a normal car park. the firm is among several, including Google, who are developing self driving cars. It hopes the technology could be commonplace within a decade. Shelley was named after Michele Mouton, the first woman to win the race up Pikes Peak in the Rocky Mountains. It its latest test, it was pitted against David Vodden, the racetrack CEO and amateur touring class champion - and was faster by 0.4 of a second. The team hopes to use the same technology that helps Shelley navigate around corners to develop collision avoidance systems for normal cars . The car giant has also been working with Stanford University scientists have to develop the self-driving robotic car. The white Audi TTS was last year put through its paces on the Thunderhill Raceway, north of Sacramento, California. The . autonomous car raced round the three mile course in two and a half . minutes, a time that rivals those posted by professional drivers. The affectionately named Shelley is the . result of a collaboration between Stanford's Dynamic Design Lab, led by . mechanical engineering design graduate Chris Gerdes, and the Volkswagen . Electronics Research Lab. Shelley navigates the course with the help of an assortment of algorithms. The . software that tells Shelley when to brake, how tight to turn, and when . to push the pedal to the metal, was tested by Gerdes at Thunderhill. The researchers claim the route Shelley takes is nearly the same as the one a professional racing driver would take. The Audi TTS is kitted out with antennas and sensors to help it navigate around the track . However, despite the autonomous car's sophisticated technology, it still can't quite compete with human-driven equivalents. 'Human drivers are very, very smooth,' said Gerdes. Shelley computes the fastest line around a course and executes the exact corrections required to stick to it. A . person relies more on feel and intuition, and thus may, for example, . allow the car to swing too wide in one turn if he knows it sets him up . better for the next. 'Human drivers are ok with the car operating in a comfortable range of states,' said Gerdes. 'We're trying to capture some of that spirit.' Gerdes . and his students will have the opportunity to do just that this weekend . at the Rolex Monterey Motorsports Reunion races at the Laguna Seca . Raceway. The group has enlisted two professional drivers to wear a suite of biological sensors as they race around the track. Graduate research team leader Chris Gerdes shows off the systems carried onboard the autonomous car, a modified Audi TTS . The sensors will record variables such as the driver's body temperature and heart rate. Scalp . electrodes will be used to register the driver's brain activity as they . race against other humans to determine which driving maneuvers require . the most concentration and brainpower. The . biological data will be paired with mechanical performance data from . the car – a 1966 Ford GT40, the only American-built automobile to finish . first overall at the 24 Hours of Le Mans race – which Stanford has . kitted out with feedback sensors similar to those on Shelley. 'We need to know what the best drivers do that makes them so successful,' said Gerdes. 'If we can pair that with the vehicle dynamics data, we can better use the car's capabilities.' The team believes that the experience and the data they have gained can be used to develop autonomous vehicles for use on public roads. In the nearer term, the technology could be used as an onboard co-pilot that helps the driver steer out of a dangerous situation. The reality of racing a car round a track and pushing that vehicle to its absolute limit means that it will be subjected to exceptionally high levels of stress. The recent tests left poor Shelley without any brake pads due to the intense heat generated by friction between the tyres and the pads themselves. Pushing a car to the limit on the racetrack is one of the best ways to find out what type of stress that car is under in a crisis. 'If we can figure out how to get Shelley out of trouble on a race track, we can get out of trouble on ice,' said Gerdes.","Driverless Audi A7 can navigate through multi storey car parks to find an empty space - then park itself .

"Updated: . 08:45 GMT, 6 December 2011 . It will cost £6,750,000 per hour to stage the opening and closing ceremonies for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. The astonishing figure emerged last night as a spending watchdog warned that the security bill for next year’s extravaganza has smashed through the £1billion barrier. The total cost of starting and finishing the sports jamboree will be £81million, including £41million of taxpayers’ money. Ouch! The Olympic opening and closing ceremonies are set to cost £7m-an-hour... and security costs will exceed £1billion . Each of the four ceremonies at the Olympic Stadium in Stratford, East London, will last approximately three hours, meaning they will cost £112,500 per minute. The National Audit Office warned that ministers are in danger of overshooting the £9.3billion budget for next year’s games. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport has agreed to pay £41million towards the opening and closing ceremonies – a bill that was supposed to be entirely footed by Locog, the Games’s privately-funded organising committee. The £41million of public money will double the budget for the opening and closing ceremonies to more than £80million. Although Locog has never revealed it initial budget, it was understood to be about £40million. Clock is ticking: The London Olympics get underway on July 27 next year - and the opening and closing ceremonies will now cost public £81m . Olympics Minister Hugh Robertson: 'We decided to go in at the higher figure for the benefit of the country' The amount of money needed to ensure . the safety of spectators, athletes and officials at the London 2012 . games has almost doubled after the number of security guards required . was wildly underestimated. Around 23,700 security staff – . including 7,000 off-duty soldiers – will be deployed next summer, . compared with the original estimate of 10,000. The security bill is growing because £271million has been added to the £282million already pledged. On top of this, £475million has been . set aside for policing and wider security, meaning the total cost for . keeping athletes, spectators and dignitaries safe during the competition . is now £1.03billion. According to the Government’s own . predictions, it will need to use £318million of the £354million . contingency fund that still remains. That will leave only £36million to . play with. Last night the NAO, the Whitehall . spending watchdog, warned that ministers must take ‘rigorous action’ to . curb spending and said there was a ‘real risk’ the overall budget of . £9.3billion could be exceeded. In 2005, when London won the bid to . host the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, the total cost was estimated . at £2.37billion. By 2007, this figure had quadrupled to the present . total. In a report Amyas Morse, head of the NAO, warns: ‘Not everything . is rosy. The Government is confident that there is money available to . meet known risks, but in my view, the likelihood that the Games can . still be funded within the existing £9.3billion public sector funding . package is so finely balanced that there is a real risk more money will . be needed.’ Officials insist the £9.3billion . budget will not be exceeded as the extra costs will be funded through . savings made elsewhere on Olympic 2012 spending. The Department for Culture, Media and . Sport said the Olympic Quarterly Economic Report showed the Games were . still on track to stay within budget. With eight months to go before the . Games, the NAO has warned that a contingency of only £36million is ‘not a . lot of headroom’, considering that the security budget alone has . doubled since February. Strength in numbers: There will now be 23,700 security officers on duty at the Games next summer . The £1billion plus security bill does . not even include the £253million to secure the Olympic venues during the . construction phase. The Ministry of Defence is now in . negotiations with the Home Office to provide up to 7,000 off-duty . soldiers to plug the recruitment shortfall for guards. The Government has denied it is in response to a specific security threat but simply a further analysis of numbers. Olympics Minister Hugh Robertson defended the extra spending and said London needed to advertise itself to the world next year. ‘These ceremonies will be aired around . the globe and watched by four billion people,’ he said. ‘It is a . seminal moment for Britain and we wanted to give it the wow factor and . leave a lasting economic legacy. ‘We cannot do “a Beijing” but we want to give this our best shot to encourage people from around the world to come and visit.’ Past measures: Anti-aircraft missiles were ready for the 2004 Athens Games . The TaxPayers’ Alliance pressure group . criticised the decision to put more public money towards the . ceremonies. Director Matthew Sinclair said: ‘Taxpayers might enjoy . watching the opening party for the Olympics but they won’t want to wake . up to the hangover of another £40million on the bill.’ Last night, Margaret Hodge, chairman . of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, said the contingency fund was a . very small amount for such a large project. ‘What is left in the budget for . contingency is wafer thin, at only £36million,’ she said. ‘For a project . of this size with unknown risks and eight months remaining, that is a . tiny amount of money. ‘Locog is likely to use all of its . contingency funding and would also have to call on further Government . support if there are further cost increases.’","Extra £271m added to venue security bill, now at £553m .

"A 37-year-old German tourist who crashed his drone into a freshwater lake in Yellowstone National Park while trying to film the area has been sentenced to one year of unsupervised probation, fined $1,600 and banned from the park for 12 months. YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK ? In a first-of-its-kind federal prosecution, a German national who crashed a drone into Yellowstone National Park's Lake Yellowstone has received one year of unsupervised probation as well as a one-year ban from the park, 9Wants To Know learned. Andreas Meissner, 37, operated an unmanned aircraft ? known as a Phantom 2 ? over the marina at Lake Yellowstone on July 18. The drone crashed shortly after takeoff after appearing to suffer power loss. The drone and a video card located inside an attached GoPro camera were eventually recovered by a diver 10 days later. Andreas Meissner pleaded guilty to three federal charges last week following the incident on July 18 and narrowly avoided a jail sentence in Germany. The National Park service had banned all drones from their parks system in June after numerous complaints they were disrupting patrons and posed a risk to the delicate surrounds. The prosecution is being called a first of its kind, with at least two other drone pilots facing similar charges, according to 9 News. Meissner . was operating a craft - called a Phantom 2 - over Lake Yellowstone when . the drone crashed into the water following apparent power loss. He . was caught after asking park officers for help in retrieving his drone . and the GoPro camera and SD camera attached to it, which were all . recovered 10 days later by a diver. The National Park Service seized the equipment, which has not been returned to Meissner. Pristine: Andreas Meissner crashed his drone into the water of Yellowstone Lake in Wyoming in July. The lake is the largest freshwater lake above 7,000 ft (2,100 m) in North America . Meissner . told officials he was shooting video for a German nonprofit called and . Run and Ride for Reading as part of a push to organize a charity bicycle . ride across America. However prosecutors claimed Meissner did not disclose his intentions when he entered the park. Meissner appeared via telephone from Germany in a federal courtroom inside Yellowstone National Park during the hearing last Wednesday. He pleaded guilty to three charges, with the US Attorney's Office dropping a fourth charge of giving a false report to a government employee, 9 News reported. Because his probation sentence is unsupervised, Meissner will not have to check in with U.S. officials.

"A gang-rape victim who has spent years battling for the victim compensation she was promised after she was attacked by three men in 2008 says she’s extremely disappointed with the NSW Government after she took a petition signed by 120,000 supporters to them and was basically palmed off. 'I'm stuck in a bureaucratic nightmare,’ Katrina Keshishian told Daily Mail Australia. 'I did get quite emotional at points I tried to hold it together to be taken seriously.’ Katrina has spent six years fighting for full compensation after she was raped on the banks of a river at 20-years-old but budget cuts meant she only received less than half of the amount she was once promised. On Wednesday she bravely took a petition signed by 120,000 supporters to NSW Attorney-General Brad Hazzard in Sydney in the hope that he would reverse the decision. Scroll down for video . Katrina Keshishian gave her petition to NSW Attorney-General Brad Hazzard in Sydney on Wednesday . NSW Premier Mike Baird, her mother Camren Rae and the campaign director for Change.org Karen Skinner, were in the meeting room when Katrina was told that the Attorney-General had not prepared any changed proposals. ‘I was disappointed… they have promised to review it,’ Katrina said as she explained how she was told they won’t have time to look at it before parliament stops sitting next week and no legislation will be changed until next year after the state election. ‘They haven’t given me a time frame… they are not willing to do anything,’ she said. ‘They were basically sorry to hear what had happened to me and the Attorney-General is going to go over the petition and read the comments from everyone who signed it,’ she added. Despite the devastating setback, Katrina said she is not going to stop fighting on behalf of all the victims who have had their compensation cut. ‘I’m disappointed but it means that I’m going to keep fighting and pushing to become a priority… they gave no indication to what they are prioritising,’ she added. Katrina is campaigning to have retrospective cuts to compensation reversed . She is fighting to receive full compensation for the gang rape she experienced six years ago . Katrina has been overwhelmed by the public support she has received since launching her petition and waiving her right to anonymity as a rape victim. ‘I didn’t really think 120,000 signatures would be that heavy, to feel all that weight was amazing,’ she said. She explained she has been contacted by hundreds more sexual assault victims, some of whom are still waiting for compensations and others who have had their lump payments cut. ‘I’m going keep trying and I’m not going to give up… they are all thanking me for the strength to come out and give a voice to the people who want to remain anonymous still…. all these people, it’s just so amazing,’ she said. NSW Attorney-General Brad Hazzard greeted her in Sydney and took the 'very heavy' box of 120,000 signatures . The pair were engaged in an hour and a half meeting in Sydney on Wednesday . Katrina has been overwhelmed by the support from the public after she came forward with her story . Katrina recently told her story on the ABC’s 7:30 report. She said she has relived the nightmare every day since three men attacked her in Windsor in Sydney’s outer-west after she met one of them at her local Leagues Club at St Mary's. After her parents went home she stayed at the club to have a drink and play on the pokies when she met a young man and quickly struck up a rapport. 'He seemed like a really nice guy - we started talking and we had a lot in common at the time, so I had no reason to be in fear of the man - I was just having a good time,' she said . She agreed to go dancing with him at a nightclub and when he brought two friends to join them she was not alarmed. Ms Keshishian said she used to be a 'happy-go-lucky kind of girl' before the vicious attack . When they ended up driving 20 kilometres to Windsor to a riverbank for ‘a few beers’, she convinced herself not to worry and ended up having consensual sex with the man she’d met earlier. But when she opened her eyes and saw his friends surrounding them, he told his mates ‘sharing’s caring, get down here.’ A distraught Ms Keshishian told 7.30 last week: ‘That's when the other two took turns at raping me.’ 'They just got on top of me and spread my legs apart and one of them was holding the top part of my body down so that that I couldn't get up and they just had sex with me,' she said. Now Ms Keshishian is too frightened to go out as she has relived the horror everyday for the past six years . The Leagues Club at St Mary's where Ms Keshishian met the man who invited his two mates to join them . Ms Keshishian had spent the night with her family at the club before she decided to stay a bit longer on her own . The men drove back to St Mary's and dumped her at a petrol station where the attendant called the police who took her to hospital for a rape examination. 'I had to sit around for hours with their DNA inside me - it was horrible - I just wanted to have a shower,' she recalled. When it came to appearing in court Ms Keshishian could not bear to relive the rape under cross-examination and the men were not convicted. Despite this Ms Keshishian is entitled to victim compensation and because there were two or three offenders her rape was classified as a category assault and she was meant to receive between $25,000 to $50,000. Ms Keshishian’s case was finally approved in June but she was appalled when she was awarded just $15,000. ‘I've paid through the nose for psychological help to recover but because the government still hasn't paid my victims of crime compensation – 6 years since being raped – it's meant I've been in debt and had to borrow money from friends and family just to get help,' Ms Keshishian said. In 2013, the government retrospectively changed the legislation to cut the amount of compensation and support for gang rape victims. ‘I don't understand why they're doing this to me. I can't fully move on because the government won't finalise my case,' she said. 'To me it says the government doesn't care about victims - all it cares about is saving some money.' Ms Keshishian is desperately trying to rebuild life after the brutal gang rape at just 20-years-old . She said she desperately needs compensation to assist with the ongoing psychological help . Ms Keshishian said she is scarred for life from the traumatic experience. 'I used to be a really happy-go-lucky kind of girl - I used to go out with my friends all of the time – I don't go out anymore at all,' she said. 'It’s living in fear every moment of the day - it’s the nightmares that wake me up and I can't get a proper sleep most nights.' She is desperately trying to move on from the horror of that night six years ago. 'Now I just want this to all be over, to have closure on this and be able to get the ongoing help I need to recover,’ she said. 'It ruined my life they took away from me something that wasn't theirs - I can still hear them laughing at me in their dreams.' Determined not to give up on fighting, Ms Keshishian started a change.org petition. ‘This is very hard for me to talk about. I was gang raped in 2008 by three men. I was 20-years-old. They took turns raping me on the banks of a river – then dumped me at a servo,’ she wrote in the online petition. She went onto describe how the gang-rape: ‘Plunged my life into a living hell. The nightmares and flashbacks still terrify me.’ In a devastating plea for help she added: ‘I can't even describe how horrific being gang-raped was - it will haunt me forever, but what's even worse is the toll it's taken on my life.' To make matters worse - the financial impact is also taking its toll. ‘I'm broke, I've had to pay huge amounts of money to get treatment,' she said. 'If I can't get support, then they will have not only made me suffer personally, but also have put me in a position impossible to work my way out of.' Ms Keshishian says she can still hear the men who gang-raped her laughing at her in her sleep at night .","Katrina Keshishian was gang raped by three men six years ago .

"A baroness has spoken of her ‘horror’ at discovering she could see her own garden using Google satellite imagery. Lady O’Cathain said: ‘I was horrified the other day when I was given a certain website to look at. I could see the roses in my garden. ‘It was on a Google map or something, and I have no idea how it was taken. Lady O’Cathain said the picture of her garden, in which she could see her roses, had been 'taken up there' ‘It was taken from up there. Obviously it was not a large aircraft, but this is happening. It did not fill me with a sense of security.’ But her comments, which were shared more than 2,000 times on Twitter, provoked concern among internet users that she appeared not to understand the difference between satellites – which capture images used by Google – and aerial photography. Others voiced concern that the baroness, who is also on the House of Lords Digital Skills Committee, was not familiar with basic technology like Google Maps. One Twitter user wrote: ‘Good God, these people are supposed to look out for us and they don’t know even the basics of today’s world.’ Another said: ‘Good thing she’s not involved in creating laws that touch on public policy or technology. Oh wait…’ The baroness’s comments were made during a House of Lords sub-committee meeting on the rise of personal drones which can take aerial pictures and video, and how they should be regulated. Paul Cremin, of the Department for Transport, said there was a problem with people buying small drones (file) Paul Cremin, of the Department for Transport, said there was a growing problem with members of the public buying small drones, often fitted with cameras, for personal use without realising they were regulated by aviation law. He told the committee: ‘You can go into Maplins today and buy a fairly sophisticated system for about £500. The question is that when you get the box home, where, first of all, does it tell you that you are buying an aircraft, let alone anything else? ‘They are viewed in the Air Navigation Order as aircraft, and you have responsibilities under that order, but if I do not know that they are aircraft I do not know how to behave. This is a very real problem that we are aware of.’ He said the Civil Aviation Authority was calling on manufacturers to include information on aviation law and relevant data protection and privacy law with drones sold for personal use.","Spoke of 'horror' at being able to see her own garden with satellite imagery .

"Pictures and footage have emerged showing a man and his partner waving a giant Australian flag in the crowd at the Melbourne Cup - and the shocking moment Araldo flipped out and broke his leg on the way back to the mounting yard that led vets to put him down. Channel Seven have identified a man in a green polo shirt and a black cap as Mark Schneider, who along with his partner was pictured on the fence celebrating the race with a huge flag. Footage taken from the woman's phone, Channel Seven cameras and a camera mounted on the helmet of Araldo's jockey Dwayne Dunn capture the exact moment the horse spots the flag in the crowd and loses its composure - kicking a fence that shattered its leg. It comes as Racing Victoria confirmed that flags would be banned for the remainder of the Melbourne Cup carnival - and that horses would be led back to mountain yard via a different route away from the crowd. Scroll down for video . Mark Schneider, pictured in a green polo shirt and a black cap, says he deeply regretted the incident . Mr Schneider, with the assistance of another man, helps hold his partner up as she waves the large flag that spooked Araldo . Seven-year-old stallion Araldo (left) ridden by Dwayne Dunn is pictured tangled in the fence after being spooked by an Australian flag . Araldo, piloted by jockey Dwayne Dunn, is clearly distressed at the sight of the flag . Racegoers claim that Mr Schneider thought the incident was funny - but he said in a statement to Seven News that he was 'shattered' and 'deeply shaken' The man and his partner are then confronted moments later by angry punters in the crowd, who have accused the couple of finding it funny. 'A horse got hurt and you thought it was funny,' a racegoer says to Mr Schneider. 'You just put it up again.... the owners of Araldo have a million-dollar horse that's going to get the vet now saving its life because of you.' 'But you think it's funny. You laughed at security when he came up to you. Mr Schneider told Seven News in a statement: 'As owners ourselves we are shattered at the events of yesterday ... regretting what unfolded and are deeply shaken,' But a woman who witnessed the confrontation between Mr Schneider and the man in the crowd claims he wasn't initially bothered by Araldo's reaction. 'I don't think he really cared until he found out that the horse was injured.' Admire Rakti, the pre-race favourite, also died shortly after the prestigious race, with a preliminary autopsy pointing to to acute heart failure and an irregular heart rhythm as the cause of death. VRC confirmed the rule changes to Daily Mail Australia on Wednesday evening, citing the safety and wellbeing of horses, participants, employees and other event patrons as the key reasons. The ban on flags will be in place for the remaining two days of the spring racing carnival, but it has not been confirmed whether these measures will be implemented permanently. Julian Sullivan, VRC Acting Chief Executive, said the amendments had been implemented in direct response to Araldo sustaining a broken pastern when returning to the Mounting Yard on Tuesday. 'While it is important not to respond in a knee-jerk manner, these interim arrangements will be implemented until procedures are reviewed after the Melbourne Cup Carnival,' Mr Sullivan said. Horses will also be led along a different path after the race, a decision which was made in conjunction with Racing Victoria Chairman of Stewards Terry Bailey. 'Traditionally horses wait for the winner to lead them down the race, but will now enter the Mounting Yard in the order they return,' Mr Sullivan said. 'The larger crowds that gather for the Group 1 races will still have the opportunity to see the horses return to scale along the track.' Earlier on Wednesday pictures emerged showing Araldo, which ran seventh, clearly distressed at the site of a large flag being waved by a member of the public - who then shattered its leg after freaking out and kicking a fence on the way back to the mounting yard. Anthony Feroce, the racing manager of Araldo's stables, told the Herald Sun Melbourne Cup organisers should review crowd control measures after the freak incident, saying: 'It's not like car racing.' In mobile phone footage aired on Channel Seven, a man is seen angrily confronting Mr Schneider . Mr Schneider pictured here in the crowd says he is a regular racegoer and has previously waved the flag at the Melbourne Cup . The horse, which ran seventh, is clearly distressed at the site of a large flag being waved by a member of the crowd - and shattered its leg after freaking out and kicking a fence on the way back to the mounting yard . This shot taken from a camera mounted to the helmet of Araldo's jockey Dwayne Dunn shows the moment the horse spots the flag . The horse was later put down due to the injury suffered, during Melbourne Cup Day at Flemington Racecourse in Melbourne on Tuesday . The death of Araldo and pre-race favour Admire Rakti overshadowed victory for the German-trained Protectionist, who romped away with the biggest winning margin in nearly two decades, and also reignited a bitter debate about the ethical treatment of racing horses. Dr Stewart said an autopsy was conducted for Admire Rakti on Tuesday night at the University of Melbourne and initial results point to acute heart failure and an irregular heart rhythm. A full post mortem with microscopic and toxicology studies will take 10 days or more, he said. 'It's seen in racehorses and human athletes as well - in the large mass of the muscle of the heart, the electrical current has to get through in a coordinated way, and at high heart rates sometimes that can become short circuited,' Dr Stewart said. Admire Rakti, the pre-race favourite, finished last in the Melbourne Cup and almost walked across the line . The heartbreaking moment that Melbourne Cup pre-race favourite Admire Rakti collapses and dies in the stall after the race . Racing Victoria head of veterinary services and equine welfare Dr Brian Stewart (left) and chairman of stewards Terry Bailey arrive at a press conferenceon Wednesday. Mr Bailey called Dr Stewart at 10pm the night before the Melbourne Cup to ask him to vet Admire Rakti . 'It happens more or less spontaneously with no warning.' He initially said the horse suffered from 'sudden death syndrome', which occurs in just 0.007 per cent of racehorses. The reason for Araldo’s demise was immediately clear. Speaking shortly afterwards, his trainer Mike Moroney said that the stallion had become distressed by a big flag and run off. 'They run the Melbourne Cup for 154 years and nothing like that has happened,' he said. Anthony Feroce, racing manager at Mike Moroney's Ballymore stables, said the horse's death was a 'freakish accident', but he anticipated the Victoria Racing Club would review how close punters are allowed to get to Cup horses following the race. 'I think the Victoria Racing Club does a magnificent job, but possibly they could look at flags that close to where the horses go,' Mr Feroce said. 'Someone had a big flag and was waving it and right at the time when our horse went passed it and they're animals, they get spooked quite easily.' Mr Feroce added that it was 'not fair' that racing was being portrayed as a cruel industry following the deaths of the two horses. 'All care is taken for their wellbeing and their welfare and I assure you, you've just got to talk to everybody involved and see how much love they have for the animals,' he said. 'Now and then we do have unfortunate accidents that happen but that's no different to any other sport.' The deaths of the two horses prompted an outpouring of comment online and reaction from animal charities who insist that racing is a cruel sport.

"These are the satellite images being used by the UN to claim that facilities at two Iranian cities may be used to develop nuclear weapons. Satellite images of Arak and Natanz show changes to the facilities in the areas when compared with images taken in October 2010. The overhead pictures were released by Google following a report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) which expressed 'serious concerns regarding possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear programme'. 2010: A satellite image shows the facility in Natanz, Iran, described as the country's 'biggest nuclear facility' A year on: Sections of road appear to have have been developed or removed and other landscape changes are noticeable in the satellite image taken last month . The IAEA report released earlier this week states that while some activities in Iran have civilian as well as military applications, others are 'specific to nuclear weapons'. There were indications in the dossier that the country had conducted detonator development, as well as high explosives testing and electronic modelling of a nuclear warhead core. The IAEA report, which ‘completely discredits’ the Islamic nation’s protestations of innocence, according to Foreign Secretary William Hague, cites preparatory work for a nuclear weapons test.

It is also thought to be the largest nuclear facility in Iran, and has anti-aircraft weapons to defend itself from potential airstrikes. The town of Arak is home to a heavy-water production plant, which can be used to generate nuclear power.

"With her flowing blonde hair, flawless skin and Hollywood heartthrob boyfriend, Blake Lively has seemingly got it all. But the actress, who shot to fame as Serena Van der Woodsen on Gossip Girl, has revealed that she isn't as confident as she may appear and even uses her hair to hide behind. Speaking to Hello! magazine, the 26-year-old said: 'Honestly I am a shy person and my hair is a safety net for me, so I love to have it down and full and relaxed. A-list locks: Blake says she snubs hot tools when it comes to looking after her hair . 'Often you see people on the red carpet with tight-up dos, but that makes me feel stiff.' Much to our annoyance, the Green Lantern actress revealed that her perfectly coiffed hair doesn't take much effort. Blake explains that she simply applies a hair mask (she loves Kerastase Reflection Chroma Captive Hair Masque), doesn't rinse it completely from the ends and then dries it until it's slightly wet, pops it into a ballerina bun and lets it dry. She also loves to apply extra virgin coconut oil to the ends before shampooing, a trick Miranda Kerr also swears by. Trademark style: Blake, pictured at the Charles James: Beyond Fashion Costume Institute Gala, says she loves her hair to look natural and flowing because up-dos make her feel 'stiff' Blake also claims that she wears 'very little make-up' in her day-to-day life but cites fragrance as 'essential' because it evokes memories and emotions for her. Another beauty trick she swears by is the power of eyelash glue, which she and her team use to stick her red carpet gowns to her skin to avoid any styling mishaps. As for fashion, she looks to icons such as Katharine Hepburn and Grace Kelly for style inspiration. 'They looked like princesses and, for me, that is style. I always want to wear clothes that my children will one day look back on and say, ""Oh, you looked amazing - why didn't you keep that?"" Not, ""Oh my God - I can't believe you wore that"",' she said. While she is minimalistic when it comes to her beauty regime, Blake loves to dress up. She said: 'I'm not happy wearing sweats [jogging bottoms], because I love dressing up so much. 'I liken myself to a little girl having a tea party at the house all of the time. I actually dress up more in my home than I do walking down the street just because it is so much fun to play dress-up.'

"The man shot dead by Gold Coast police has been named and is alleged to have attacked his own mother who made a desperate call for help before the incident, police say. Officers were called to Nakina St, Southport after 7pm on Monday when police allege that Troy Foster ran at the officers with a 'large knife'. The 60-year-old woman rang Triple 000 to report that the 32-year-old man, believed to be her son, had assaulted her, The Courier Mail reported. It is the third shooting, and the second fatal shooting, by police officers in the southeast Queensland region in the past seven days. Scroll down for video .

The Queensland Police ethical standards command will investigate the shooting. Monday's shooting comes after a man was shot dead on the Sunshine Coast on Sunday. A first-year constable and a 10-year veteran senior constable were called to the Tewantin home after residents reported a domestic disturbance. The Queensland Police Union said officers were immediately confronted by a violent man, who allegedly came at them with an unspecified weapon as they arrived in their patrol car. The officer shot the 51-year-old man in the chest. Acting Superintendent John Bosnjak told a media conference on Sunday evening that the man shot dead was not from Queensland. 'It's a traumatic time for the family and police, you don't come to work to be involved in matters like this.' he said.

"Ghost writers are advertising their services to write essays for university students through online classified websites. A photo of an attractive and studious-looking brunette, who is touting herself as a 'psychology tutor and essay writer', is posted alongside her advertisement on classifieds site, Gumtree, encouraging students to contact her for an academic helping hand.

In higher-education we've had to up the ante in how students are changing the methods of cheating for some time.’ She said that the news that flyers advertising the MyMaster essay writing service were posted in UTS toilets was not alarming. ‘We find those kinds of things all the time, that's not something that is new,’ she said. ‘When we find them we do take the number and call them and point out how illegal it is but they do appear all the time that's not something new,’ she explained. Ms Dou has denied knowing anything about the website MyMaster website which has now been taken down . Students (a stock photo is shown) have reportedly paid up to $1000 for their essays to be written for them . The Sydney Morning Herald reported that a flyer posted at the University of Technology Sydney said: ‘Are you racking your brains on your school work? Do you worry about spending $3000 retaking tuition on the failing subject? Leave your worries to MyMaster and make your study easier!’ Ms Dou has denied knowing anything about the website, which has now been taken down. The company’s Facebook page has also been removed but a holding page shows 605 previously people 'liked' it. She reportedly also runs Yingcredible Tutoring, a page which she has endorsed from her own personal Facebook account. ‘We provide commerce subjects tutoring service to university students to help them pass the course,’ a description on the page reads. Daily Mail Australia has contacted Ms Dou for comment but she has not responded. Most university websites display clear advice about plagiarism. The University of Sydney says that while nobody commences their studies with the intent to plagiarise ‘many people do, for a variety of reasons’. ‘Some students plagiarise because they don’t fully understand what plagiarism is, why it is wrong and how it can be avoided. Others plagiarise, because of time or other pressures,’ a warning on their website reads. Ms Dou also reportedly runs Yingcredible Tutoring, which is another service for students . When handing in work students must satisfy the notion that it is ‘all your own work’. Students who have used the MyMaster website could be found guilty of ‘dishonest plagiarism’, which is when they ‘knowingly presenting another person’s work as one’s own work without appropriate acknowledgement of the source’. And ‘engage another person to produce or conduct research for the work, including for payment or other consideration’. A spokesperson for the University of Sydney told Daily Mail Australia: 'The University of Sydney is unequivocally opposed to academic dishonesty, including plagiarism and fraudulent authorship, and takes seriously any allegations of academic misconduct. Breaches of academic honesty are not tolerated at the University of Sydney.' 'Failure to adhere to the University’s high standards of academic merit, intellectual rigour, and ethical behaviour constitutes a breach of the University’s Code of Conduct for Students and Academic Dishonesty and Plagiarism in Coursework Policy. If proven, academic dishonesty may constitute misconduct, resulting in serious penalties that may include failure or exclusion. 'The University thoroughly investigates all cases of alleged academic dishonesty and provides education and support to assist students to observe the rules of honest scholarship,' they added.","Ghost writers advertising their services to students on classified websites .

"A male whale that was stranded on a Gold Coast beach for two days is finally free after a third rescue operation was successfully pulled off. The juvenile humpback at first remained trapped on a sand bank on Thursday morning when the tow rope snapped towards the back of the breakers and the whale ended up back on the sand. In dramatic scenes, the 15-20 tonne mammal was seen thrashing around and flipping its tail in shallow waters just off the beach at sunrise. The whale, thought to be about 2-5 years old, was stuck about 5 metres off Palm Beach while the surf rolled it around but it eventually broke free and swam out into the ocean to the relief of rescuers and onlookers. Seaworld marine animal supervisor Tacha Mulligan - who did not sleep for two days during the rescue - said the whale is 'very exhausted, he'll get past those breakers, have a rest, recoup and get his energy back'. Scroll down for video . Back where he belongs: The 20 tonne juvenile whale is finally swimming away from the Palm Beach shore after two days . Free at last: 250 onlookers cheered as the humpback finally swam out to sea from Palm Beach on Thursday . A Sea World spokesman told MailOnline staff will continue to monitor the whale's health now it is free and that Thursday's rescue was 'a continuing process of what we had in place'. The whale's condition deteriorated since it appeared on the beach late on Tuesday. 'We were working against the conditions, time was running out,' another spokesperson told the ABC. 'We're cautiously optimistic it will be ok from here on in.' Two previous attempts on Wednesday's high tides failed to free the whale. On Wednesday afternoon incoming tidal waves flipped the juvenile humpback twice partially submerging it and facing it towards the ocean, enabling it to attempt to return to deeper water. This came after surfers previously turned the mammal to face the wrong way. But it was then stranded again on a sand bank, a Sea World spokesman said. Despite freezing temperatures and the high risk of danger, footage on Channel Nine News on Wednesday showed spectators deciding to take matters into their own hands by using their combined weight to move the eight-metre mammal as light was fading. Seaworld marine animal supervisor Tacha Mulligan said the whale is 'very exhausted, he'll get past those breakers, have a rest, recoup and get his energy back' Stranded again: The whale was stuck on a sand bank on Thursday morning after another failed rescue attempt . Stuck: The juvenile humpback is still in a fair condition Sea World staff have said . Despite freezing temperatures and the potential danger, the spectators decided to take matters into their own hands by using their combined weight to move the eight-metre mammal as light was fading . Authorities informed the exasperated onlookers that it was too dangerous to continue the rescue mission in the dark. One onlooker, Mark Wilkinson from Bendigo in Victoria, told Fairfax Radio 4BC he admired the efforts of the rescue workers. 'I think they are great trying to get this magnificent beast off the beach. I think they will be successful,' he said. 'I saw a woman get angry this morning and I think it was uncalled for. They are doing their best.' The whale has experienced a distressing 24 hours after it washed up on the beach at 6.30pm on Tuesday night and was actually freed Wednesday afternoon but was soon washed onto the shore again. The dedicated team was placed in a hairy situation earlier in the day when the whale rolled over on its back almost trapping the rescuers who quickly clambered out of the way. There was then grave concerns that the mammal would drown before it eventually flipped back over as the relieved crowd cheered. Frustrated onlookers jumped into the surf to try to save a beached humpback whale after repeated attempts to rescue the 15-20 tonne mammal at Palm Cove had failed throughout the day . Despite freezing temperatures and the potential danger, the spectators decided to take matters into their own hands by using their combined weight to move the eight-metre mammal as light was fading . The tireless operation began at sunrise when a harness from Sea World was put around the whale and attached to a rescue boat but all three attempts to tow the heavy animal failed with the rope snapping every time. As the tide went out half way through the day, the rescuers were left with no choice but to shelter the whale and keep it wet with buckets of water. Experts from Sea World and the state environment department stayed with the whale overnight. It's said to be in a fair condition after being spotted near the shoreline on Tuesday night.

There was then grave concerns that the mammal would drown before it eventually flipped back over as the relieved crowd cheered . The juvenile humpback whale will spend a second night on the shore and the operation will resume at sunrise on Thursday . This is the third whale to have beached in the past 24 hours with two rescued in NSW on Tuesday night during the whales' annual migration from Antarctica to their breeding grounds in the Great Barrier Reef. A spate of humpback whales becoming beached on east coast beaches is a positive sign of the species' staggering recovery in Australia from almost extinction to nearly 50,000 in under 30 years, an expert has said. If the population continues to rise at such a high rate there will soon be more whales on Australia's east coast than existed in the natural population before commercial whaling began. Scroll down for video . Covered: The stranded Humpback Whale on Palm Beach, Gold Coast, has had a tent erected around it while Sea World staff tended to it . Waiting game: Rescue teams made numerous attempts to rescue the whale but to no avail . There were just 200 humpback whales left alive on the east coast of Australia before the commercial whaling ban was introduced in 1986 - now they are flourishing, with 20,000 currently migrating along the shores. 'Australia's humpback whale population are increasing rapidly and are recovering as a result of the ban on commercial whaling,' Southern Cross University Professor Peter Harrison said. 'We have seen a 10 per cent increase in births this year and expect another 2000 whales to be added to the population,' he told MailOnline. 'Back then in the last century very few people were studying them but it's estimated before whaling there were 23-26,000 whales. 'At present we expect to exceed 30,000 whales on the east coast in the next decade,' Dr Harrison explained. He added if you combine the west and east coast whale populations, Australia could now have around 50,000 humpback whales. Another humpback whale was stranded on a sand bank at the Gold Coast earlier in the week, but finally managed to swim its way to freedom two days later . Help is at hand: The whale calf is tended to by Sea World staff after beaching itself at Palm Beach on the Gold Coast . Crowds: People gathered to see the whale on the beach before further attempts to return the whale to deeper water began again at high tide around 5pm . The huge population rise will eventually even out when the whales use up the ocean's natural resources. A Sea World spokesman told Mailonline there is no 'real reason' why whales strand themselves but there are more wales around at the moment which is why the number of incidents has risen. 'There are 20,000 whales on the Gold Coast in this migration,' he said. 'As for why some are stranded there is no real reason, it all depends on the whales individual behaviour.' A resident alerted authorities about the latest beached whale about 7pm on Tuesday night, after spotting it near the Palm Beach shoreline. 'It's pretty dangerous. This animal is probably around 15 to 20 tonne. Once the tide starts to come in, which it's doing now, you can't really get close to the animal because it could roll, it could lift it's tail,' Sea World spokesman Trevor Long told the ABC. 'So we'd ask that no-one goes down there and tries to get close to the animal.' Stranded: The huge creature was hoped to be freed at first light on Thursday . 'Pretty dangerous': Sea World spokesman Trevor Long told the ABC said that people shouldn't get close to the whale . Rescue operation: A team helping to try and free the whale after it was spotted on Tuesday night . 'Currently the tide is against us, we are waiting for this afternoon to free it,' a Sea World spokesperson told MailOnline. A second distressed humpback whale was trapped in fishing nets for more than eight hours at The Pass in Byron Bay on Tuesday. The whale reportedly had a rope wrapped around its dorsal fin and tail, and was spotted at first light on Tuesday morning. New South Wales Parks and Wildlife service kept and eye on the whale early in the day and in a joint effort with Queensland Fisheries officers managed to free the animal just before 4pm. Also on Tuesday, a third whale was freed off NSW on the far south coast in Narooma. The migration period runs from July until October when the whales make the return journey to their southern feasting grounds. The International Whale Commission banned commercial whaling in 1986 to conserve depleted species . Only last weekend two groups of humpback whales were spotted heading north a few hundred metres of Bluff Rock near Yeppoon.","The whale escaped on Thursday morning after it was beached on Palm Beach, Queensland, since Tuesday night .

"She was gang-raped by three men in a horrific attack at the age of 20 and has spent six years battling to receive compensation to pay for psychological help to rebuild her life. Now Katrina Keshishian has decided to speak out about the devastating experience in 2008 that has left her broken, as she appeared on the ABC’s 7:30 report to expose how budget cuts have meant she received less than half of the compensation she was once promised. Ms Keshishian wants the New South Wales Government to reassess her case after they handed her a paltry $15,000 instead of $50,000. Scroll down for video . Katrina Keshishian is fighting to receive compensation for the gang rape she experienced six years ago . Ms Keshishian said she used to be a 'happy-go-lucky kind of girl' before the vicious attack . The brave young woman told the ABC of the nightmare she has relived every day since three men attacked her in Windsor in Sydney’s outer-west after she met one of them at her local Leagues Club at St Mary's. After her parents went home she stayed at the club to have a drink and play on the pokies when she met a young man and quickly struck up a rapport. 'He seemed like a really nice guy - we started talking and we had a lot in common at the time, so I had no reason to be in fear of the man - I was just having a good time,' she said . She agreed to go dancing with him at a nightclub and when he brought two friends to join them she was not alarmed. When they ended up driving 20 kilometres to Windsor to a riverbank for ‘a few beers’, she convinced herself not to worry and ended up having consensual sex with the man she’d met earlier. But when she opened her eyes and saw his friends surrounding them, he told his mates ‘sharing’s caring, get down here.’ A distraught Ms Keshishian told 7.30 on Monday night: ‘That's when the other two took turns at raping me.’ 'They just got on top of me and spread my legs apart and one of them was holding the top part of my body down so that that I couldn't get up and they just had sex with me,' she said. Now Ms Keshishian is too frightened to go out as she has relived the horror everyday for the past six years . The Leagues Club at St Mary's where Ms Keshishian met the man who invited his two mates to join them . Ms Keshishian had spent the night with her family at the club before she decided to stay a bit longer on her own . The men drove back to St Mary's and dumped her at a petrol station where the attendant called the police who took her to hospital for a rape examination. 'I had to sit around for hours with their DNA inside me - it was horrible - I just wanted to have a shower,' she recalled. When it came to appearing in court Ms Keshishian could not bear to relive the rape under cross-examination and the men were not convicted. Despite this Ms Keshishian is entitled to victim compensation and because there were two or three offenders her rape was classified as a category assault and she was meant to receive between $25,000 to $50,000. Ms Keshishian’s case was finally approved in June but she was appalled when she was awarded just $15,000. ‘I've paid through the nose for psychological help to recover but because the government still hasn't paid my victims of crime compensation – 6 years since being raped – it's meant I've been in debt and had to borrow money from friends and family just to get help,' Ms Keshishian said. In 2013, the government retrospectively changed the legislation to cut the amount of compensation and support for gang rape victims. ‘I don't understand why they're doing this to me. I can't fully move on because the government won't finalise my case,' she said. 'To me it says the government doesn't care about victims - all it cares about is saving some money.' Ms Keshishian is desperately trying to rebuild life after the brutal gang rape at just 20-years-old . She said she desperately needs compensation to assist with the ongoing psychological help . Ms Keshishian said she is scarred for life from the traumatic experience. 'I used to be a really happy-go-lucky kind of girl - I used to go out with my friends all of the time – I don't go out anymore at all,' she said. 'It’s living in fear every moment of the day - it’s the nightmares that wake me up and I can't get a proper sleep most nights.' She is desperately trying to move on from the horror of that night six years ago. 'Now I just want this to all be over, to have closure on this and be able to get the ongoing help I need to recover,’ she said. 'It ruined my life they took away from me something that wasn't theirs - I can still hear them laughing at me in their dreams.' Determined not to give up on fighting, Ms Keshishian started a change.org petition recently to campaign against the decision and has already received over 21,000 signatures of support. ‘This is very hard for me to talk about. I was gang raped in 2008 by three men. I was 20-years-old. They took turns raping me on the banks of a river – then dumped me at a servo,’ she wrote in the online petition. She went onto describe how the gang-rape: ‘Plunged my life into a living hell. The nightmares and flashbacks still terrify me.’ In a devastating plea for help she added: ‘I can't even describe how horrific being gang-raped was - it will haunt me forever, but what's even worse is the toll it's taken on my life.' To make matters worse - the financial impact is also taking its toll. ‘I'm broke, I've had to pay huge amounts of money to get treatment,' she said. 'If I can't get support, then they will have not only made me suffer personally, but also have put me in a position impossible to work my way out of.' Ms Keshishian says she can still hear the men who gang-raped her laughing at her in her sleep at night .","Katrina Keshishian was gang raped by three men six years ago .

"David Cameron will today try to shame other EU leaders into doing more to tackle Ebola after warning they need to ‘wake up’ to the crisis posed by the killer disease. The Prime Minister is expected to use a European Council leaders’ summit in Brussels to step up pressure on them to increase their contributions to fighting the outbreak. Mr Cameron, who has challenged EU member states to provide a total of 1 billion euros (£790m) and 2,000 medical workers to tackle the outbreak, will point out how Britain’s giving has so far dwarfed that of other countries. Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured today, is to use a summit in Brussels to challenge other leaders to increase financial support for the fight against Ebola . A Government source said: ‘We are very much out in front in Europe on this and leading the way. We have pledged £125m (156m euros), which is 40million euros ahead of the next highest country, Germany, in aid. ‘It is four times more than France has pledged to date and 50 times more than Spain, which has obviously had cases in Madrid.’ Following a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg in Monday, it is thought that around 750 million euros (£593m) and around 1,000 personnel may be on the table today, but Mr Cameron will push for more cash, healthcare workers and equipment to assist Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, the three countries at the centre of the epidemic. ‘We are very clear that countries around the world need to recognise that by investing now to do more in the region, we help to protect ourselves from greater risk in the future,’ the source added. ‘If all 28 countries turned up at the Council and committed to do more, that would be quite a lot in terms of the three affected countries in the region.’ Mr Cameron will also use the summit to make clear that Britain regards the European Parliament's demand for a budget of 146.4 billion euros (£115.8billion) in 2015 - as well as extra top-up cash to cover overspending in 2014 - as unacceptable. Mr Cameron was in Downing Street for the launch of the Poppy Appeal before travelling to Brussels later . EU leaders agreed at a previous summit that next year's budget should be no more than 140 billion euros (£110.7billion), and the Government source said that the MEPs' bid was ‘unrealistic’. ‘Clearly we think that what the European Parliament are looking for is unrealistic in the current situation, at a time when families across the continent are dealing with the impact of the great recession,’ said the source. ‘We think they should be looking more ruthlessly at how they prioritise spending.’ Mr Cameron will also seek the support of all 28 member-states for the position on Ukraine taken by him and three other EU leaders in Milan last week, when they told Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko that Europe wants to see the implementation of last month's Minsk peace agreement, including more action by Moscow to prevent the flow of weapons across the border. Speaking about Ebola at the EU-Asia summit in Milan last week, Mr Cameron said: ‘This is the biggest health problem facing our world in a generation. ‘Britain in my view has been leading the way. The action we’re taking in Sierra Leone, where we are committing well over £100million, 750 troops, we are going to be training 800 members of health staff in Sierra Leone, providing 700 beds. ‘We are doing a huge amount and I think it’s time for other countries to look at their responsibilities and their resources and act in a similar way to what Britain is doing in Sierra Leone, America’s doing in Liberia, France is doing in Guinea. ‘Other countries now need to step forward with the resources and the action Because taking action at source in west Africa, that is the best way to protect all of us here in Europe.’","Prime Minister uses summit in Brussels to step up pressure on leaders .

"Outspoken Tasmania senator Jacqui Lambie has again hit out at 'evil' Islamic extremists branding those who follow Sharia law 'monsters', 'maniacs and depraved humans'. In an address to parliament on Monday, the Palmer United Party member said 'These thugs and extremists will not stop their acts of terrorism and depravity until their way of life, their culture and their law is imposed on Australia - indeed the whole world.' 'These maniacs and depraved humans will not stop committing their cold blooded butchery and rapes until every woman in Australia wears a burqa and is subservient to men,' Senator Lambie continued, the ABC report. The controversial party member also acknowledged her difficulty in explaining Sharia law following an awkward interview with ABC Insiders on Sunday morning. Scroll down for video . Senator Jacqui Lambie said in parliament on Monday that  those who follow sharia law are 'maniacs and depraved humans. 'It's not going to come as a shock when I tell you that I'm not an Islamic scholar,' Ms Lambie admitted. Sharia law is the moral, legal and religious code followed by all Muslims, but made notorious by extremist groups like Islamic State wanting to implement hard-line aspects of Islamic law. During the long address on Monday, Ms Lambie also said 'every major terrorist attack in the western world' such as 911, the Bali Bombings, the Boston marathon bombings and 'recent beheadings and massacres' had been carried out by supporters of sharia law. Senator Lambie also spoke of sending troops over to fight in Iraq and other parts of the middle east, and suggested: 'We need to get rid of them (Islamic extremeists) and their associates on home soil' first. 'Clean up the rubbish in your own backyard before you try to clean up the rubbish in others', she added. Senator Lambie also labelled Sharia as 'a law made up by men who hate women', and said if Islamic extremists were to take over Australia there would be no separation of church and state. On Sunday, Palmer United Party leader Clive Palmer said the statements made by Ms Lambie about sharia law and burqas on the ABC earlier that day do not reflect the views of the party. On Sunday morning Jacqui Lambie equated sharia law with acts of terrorism in a train-wreck television interview. On Sunday morning the PUP senator said on ABC's Insiders that sharia law involved terrorism . Ms Lambie (left with PUP party leader Clive Palmer and right) has reiterated her tough stance on Islam many times over the past week . Clive Palmer distanced himself from the outlandish comments, and told Fairfax Media: 'Party policy is determined by a meeting of the members and is announced by the leader'. This follows his tweets earlier in the day where he said Australian's need to 'remain united' as they have 'strong obligations towards each other'. Ms Lambie appeared on ABC's Insiders on Sunday morning and struggled to explain what she thought sharia law was when asked by the show's presenter Barrie Cassidy. In the interview, Ms Lambie also reiterated her tough stance against the moral code. 'If you are not going to show your allegiance to our law, then get out,' she said. But Ms Lambie was left tongue-tied when asked what she understood sharia to mean. 'Well I think...when it comes to...sharia law...you know to me...it obviously involves terrorism,' she told Mr Cassidy. 'It involves a power that is not a healthy power.' In comments likely to inflame current tensions with the Islamic community in Australia, Senator Lambie suggested even moderate Muslims should abandon their faith because of sharia. Senator Lambie shared this post on her public Facebook page on Thursday night as part of her 'ban the burqa' campaign . But she said she had no problems with Muslims. 'I have a problem with extremists and sharia law,' Ms Lambie said. 'I want to see their full allegiance - not 50 per cent to the Australian constitution and Australian law. 'It is one law for all - that is the Australian law, full stop.' A number of Australian Muslims have complained of being targeted following last week's terror raids, with women abused in the street and one having coffee thrown in her face while stopped at traffic lights in Brisbane. Amid all this Prime Minister Tony Abbott called for tolerance towards Australian Muslims, who he has described as 'absolutely first-class Australians'. But his stance has not been helped by some in his own party, with Liberal senator Cory Bernardi using the raids to reignite his long-running campaign to ban the burqa. Ms Lambie is part of the Palmer United Party, which is headed by Queensland mining magnate Clive Palmer . Mr Palmer sought to distance himself from Ms Lambie's comments right after Insiders . He called for Australians to 'remain united' as they had 'strong obligations towards each other' Senator Lambie again threw her weight behind a burqa ban, labelling it a 'national security issue'. 'It is like a motorbike helmet. It is like a balaclava,' she said. 'I will not allow you to wear that into my office because it is a security risk.' PUP leader Clive Palmer sought to distance himself from Ms Lambie's comments on Sunday. Immediately after the show, the mining magnate tweeted: 'Australians need to remain united, we are a rich & diverse nation who enjoy a special country.' July . August . September . But @escalator2nowhr had another take on the Jacqui Lambie situation . Leigh West questioned Ms Lambie's want of banning something she did not actually know about . Ms Lambie's comments also attracted criticism from social media users. The firebrand senator has also spoken out about what she looks for in a partner, saying they had to be well endowed . '#Insiders interview of JLamie this morning...disturbing. Cringed over he ignorance of Sharia Law despite wanting to ban it,' @nerdygirl2424 tweeted. While @escalator2nowhr took a more humorous stance: Are we absolutely sure Jacqui Lambie isn't just a new Chris Lilley character?' Chris Lilley is an Australian comedian known for his sometimes controversial characters. Earlier this week, Ms Lambie caused a storm of controversy when she shared a photograph on Facebook of a woman dressed in a burqa and holding a gun. The woman in the photo is believed to be Afghanistan's first female police officer who was gunned down while fighting against Taliban extremists. The senator was using the photo in a campaign to 'ban the burqa' for security reasons after Australia experienced the largest counter-terrorism operation in the country's history on Thursday. Ms Lambie shared the image posted by far right British group Britain First in response to Senator Cory Bernardi's opposition to the full-length garb worn by some Islamic women. On Thursday, about 800 police officers executed 25 search warrants in Sydney and Brisbane, resulting in 15 people arrested but only two people charged. Ms Lambie and PUP party leader Clive Palmer have been contacted by Daily Mail Australia for comment.","Tasmanian Senator Jacqui Lambie represents the Palmer United Party .

"A transgender person who had a £10,000 sex change  to become a woman, but now wants to become a man again, has criticised the NHS for not doing enough to make sure he wanted the initial surgery. Matthew Attonley, 30, was born a boy and seven years ago started surgery to become a woman called Chelsea, but in the last six months he has taken steps to return to being a man called Matthew. He now wants the British health service to fund the £14,000 reversal process because he claims they didn't complete a rigorous enough mental evaluation before allowing him to go through the initial process. Scroll down for video . Matthew Attonley, 30, who was born a boy, claims he had a £10,000 of medical help on the NHS to become a woman. He now wants the taxpayer to foot a further £14,000 bill to become a fully-functioning man again . He said: 'It's definitely not checked enough. 'People will hate me for that, but you have to live two full years as a woman to prove to the NHS that you are ready and there isn't enough psychiatric evaluation. 'In the real life experience - those two years, I think maybe you should have a year of intensive weekly therapy just to keep pushing you, to keep checking you, keeping tabs. 'Not just meetings every month or three months, or by letters or emails, but by intensive therapy.' After becoming a woman, Matthew  became tired of putting on make-up and wearing heels, and he now accepts that she should always have stayed a man. Matthew said he had struggled with his identity while growing up in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, and as a child he would dress up in women's clothes. In his twenties, he became a drag queen known as Miss Malibu, drawing on glamour model Katie Price's look for inspiration. An initial bid for a sex change to become a woman was turned down by a doctor, sending Matthew into a spiral of depression, he said. But then the former drag queen, who copied Jordan's style by wearing a blonde wig, mini skirts and stilettos, had a chance meeting with his idol in a nightclub in 2007. Scroll down for video . Matthew back in April, when he appeared on This Morning as a woman called Chelsea . The glamour model told him to 'go for it' and her words inspired Chelsea to return to his GP and push once again for the gender reassignment surgery, costing £10,000. But now, seven years after surgery to become a woman, Matthew wants to go back to being a man - and wants the taxpayer to foot the bill. Matthew, who lives on welfare benefits, told a magazine last week that he finds dressing and acting as a girl 'exhausting' and feels he has never been fully accepted as a real woman. Matthew, now living in London, was shocked to find out how many more social restraints are placed on women than men and admits he longed to be as free as a man. Appearing on This Morning earlier today to defend his comments, he said: 'Going from male to female, they are two completely different gender roles in society - I found I had to be different with men completely. Matthew is now embracing life as a man again, after feeling the restrictions on acting feminine too stifling . 'Girls were still the same, but guys start opening doors for you and all of those great things, but then you do have to conform to society pressures as a girl. 'So being male again, it's quite freeing actually, just to be able to live.' He is now aiming to have a breast reduction on the NHS and an intensive course of medicine and hormones at a total cost of £14,000. He said: 'I still have a male anatomy but have had gender altering treatment. 'It is an intensive course of hormones and testosterone blockers that gets you ready for surgery (to become a woman). 'It makes testicles shrink to the size of garden peas and makes you dry up in time for surgery. 'I'm trying to reverse it but it's going to be a battle because it has been almost ten years. Matthew on This Morning earlier today: . 'I still have a penis but it doesn't function in the same way, it can get  a semi-erection but it has still got to build back up. 'Because now I want to be male, I want to be the best male I can be, just like with a female, so hopefully I have to see with doctors if we can get it fully functioning.' Although Matthew now wants to have a fully-functioning male body, he is adamant that he would still love to be a woman if it could be a foolproof transformation. He said: 'I have always longed to be a woman, but no amount of surgery can give me an actual female body and I feel like I am living a lie. 'It is exhausting putting on make-up and wearing heels all the time. Even then I don't feel I look like a proper woman. 'I suffered from depression and anxiety as a result of the hormones too. Matthew during his transition period, when he lived for two years as a woman before undergoing hormone treatment on the NHS . 'I have realised it would be easier to stop fighting the way I look naturally and accept that I was born a man physically.' Matthew, who spoke on ITV's This Morning earlier this year about Katie Price's encouragement, says he does not feel guilty about asking the taxpayer to pay for his reversion. 'Now I have decided I want to live as Matthew, I am desperate to have my FF-cup boobs removed,' he said. 'I can't afford to have them done privately, so I am hoping to have the op on the NHS. 'I can't work at the moment because I am too upset after what I have been through. 'I don't feel bad about the NHS paying for the surgery as I don't consider it a choice. Matthew during his transitional period to become a woman. He claims he has always been an outgoing person . 'I need to have these operations for the sake of my mental health. I am lucky enough to live in a country where there is free health care.' Matthew, who changed his name by deed poll from Matthew in 2008 after a £5,000 boob job in Thailand partly funded by benefit money, says he gradually began having doubts about the sex change. He said: 'I thought the surgery would make me feel complete, but it didn't. 'I knew deep down that, even though I had had surgery, I had still been born a man. 'But I tried my best to block out my feelings.' Matthew said living as a woman is exhausting. 'No matter how much make-up I put on or how I dressed, I knew people would not know me as a real woman. 'It was draining to constantly think about how to walk and speak like a girl. Matthew said he had always struggled with his identity while growing up in Chesterfield, Derbyshire. As a child he would dress up in women's clothes, and in his twenties he became a drag queen known as Miss Malibu . 'I was fighting a losing battle. When people found out about my past, they treated me like a liar and a fake. I suffered from anxiety and depression.' He said she lost the support of her mother when she died from a heart attack. He said : 'I could not keep up the act of pretending to be a woman any more. It was making me miserable. 'I had to go back to living as Matthew.' Matthew has already had testosterone injections to begin his transition to becoming a man again. He has also had testosterone injections to stimulate hair growth and has cut his hair. He added: 'If people criticise me for wanting treatment on the NHS, it does not bother me. 'I know I need these changes to make me happy and no one should deny me that.' The TaxPayers' Alliance yesterday insisted the NHS should not be expected to pay out again. Research director Alex Wild said: 'The NHS must prioritise crucial frontline services over ridiculous vanity operations. 'This whole saga has simply cost far too much. If the Health Service is to be properly funded, this sort of waste must be cut out.' To watch the whole This Morning interview, go to: www.itv.com/thismorning . Do YOU have a sex change story?

"She's a squeaky-clean pop star who sings about young love and yearning. But when Eliza Doolittle wanted to sing about Jesus she joined the ranks of artists such as the Sex Pistols and Frankie Goes To Hollywood by being censored by the BBC. Eliza was asked to re-word her gentle love song Walking On Water for an appearance on the Chris Evans Show on Radio 2. Censored: Eliza Doolittle and Chris Evans were baffled at being ordered to censor the lyric about Jesus . It refers to putting on Air Max trainers to run across the water to a yearned-for love. The 25-year-old singer-songwriter said: ‘I had to change the lyrics from “Sometimes I wish I was Jesus, I’d get my Air Max on and run across the sea for you” to “Sometimes I wish it was easy to get my Air Max on and run across the sea for you”. ‘It was weird because I’m not being blasphemous, I just meant “I wish I could run across water and see you”, but maybe wishing for the power of God was blasphemous enough for them.’ The decision left Evans mystifed, given some of the songs he is allowed to play on his show. He said last night: ‘Lyrics and the Beeb have always bamboozled me. We often play Lou Reed’s Walk On The Wild Side. Check out the lyrics in that song.’ The singer-songwriter said she is not blasphemous, simply wanted to use the religious reference as a metaphor . The gentle song Walking On Water, in the album In Your Hands, is about love and yearning . The 1972 track touches on transexuality, drug use, and mentions a lewd sex act. The censorship of Eliza’s song angered former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey, who said: ‘I am totally appalled. I’m not surprised the BBC is behind this because their attitude tends to be to dumb down the Christian message. ‘I am sorry the lady agreed to this because the sense of the song is lost. Walking on water and Jesus go together.’ The BBC’s decision is the latest in a series of PC judgments affecting artists and even the Corporation’s own broadcasters. In 2011 there was uproar over reports that Jeremy Paxman had been asked to use obscure terms like ‘Common Era’ and ‘Before Common Era’, rather than AD and BC, so as not to offend non-Christians. At the time commentators pointed out that in 2,000 years the use of AD and BC had never caused offence. Shocked: Lord Carey, former Archbishop of Canterbury, blasts the move for dumbing down Christianity . Last week the BBC was forced to defend a decision by the makers of the BBC Three show Free Speech to postpone a discussion about being gay and Muslim after concerns were expressed by community leaders at the Birmingham mosque the show was being broadcast from. The Sex Pistols’ single God Save The Queen was banned completely from airplay in 1977 – the Silver Jubilee year – while gay anthem Relax by Frankie Goes To Hollywood was banned in 1984. Eliza added: ‘I think people are a bit touchy, but it’s not a big deal. I don’t take that stuff seriously.’ A BBC spokesman refused to shed any light on the incident, saying: ‘We never ask any artist to change the lyrics to their songs. ‘It’s the decision of the record company and the artist. We have clear editorial guidelines in place  to deal with religious or contentious issues and to avoid causing offence to our audiences regardless of their faith.’","Singer told to change line in Walking On Water for radio appearance .

"A former British soldier who belonged to an undercover unit in Northern Ireland has claimed he and his colleagues resorted to ‘murder and mayhem’ during a secret campaign against the IRA. Simon Cursey was a member of a 30-man team which would ‘shoot first and ask questions later’. They shot at least 20 terrorist suspects and breached the British Army’s rules of war. In support of his allegations, he has provided The Mail on Sunday with detailed descriptions of some of the most controversial killings in Northern Ireland’s recent history. A former British soldier claims he was part of an undercover unit which carried out a secret campaign against the IRA. Pictured is a soldier in Belfast during The Troubles . Cursey says these shootings were carried out by the Military Reaction Force (MRF), a clandestine Army team sent into Republican neighbourhoods to eliminate IRA gunmen. His accounts are being studied by detectives from the Police Service of Northern Ireland’s Historical Enquiries Team (HET), which was set up to re-examine suspicious deaths over  the course of ‘The Troubles’. More than 2,260 cases are on its books. Cursey’s devastating disclosures include the claim that he never once cautioned a terror suspect or fired a warning shot before himself engaging with lethal force. He said he and his colleagues shot at least 20 men, though he could not say how many died. The revelations come a week after a damning report into the 1989 death of pro-Republican lawyer Pat Finucane that revealed shocking levels of collusion between British agents and Protestant paramilitaries. In an interview with The Mail on Sunday, Cursey defended the MRF’s tactics, insisting they were necessary given the dangers he and others faced. Even so, his recollections, revealed here for the first time, are likely to increase  calls for a public inquiry into the actions of British Forces in Northern Ireland. He said: ‘We were mostly working alone or in pairs on the dim streets of Belfast. If I had given a warning I would have been as good as dead myself. The MRF was a counter-terrorist unit. How do you counter the terrorists? By terrorising them. The revelations come a week after a report into the death of pro-Republican lawyer Pat Finucane in 1989 . ‘I have nothing to hide and no element of the MRF’s activities troubled me from  a moral perspective. I’m aware the HET is looking into some of these incidents. But challenging them [the terrorists] was a luxury they were simply not entitled to.’ Cursey returns to the subject in a draft of new book based on his experiences. He writes: ‘If the IRA believed they could get away with murder and mayhem, it was the MRF’s job to make them see how they liked a taste of their own medicine.’ Cursey told The Mail on Sunday how the MRF operated. He said: ‘At night we would patrol the streets looking for our special bad boys – they were wanted for terrorist activities or murder. 'We simply dealt with them, very severely, and then dropped them off at the roadside for the uniformed forces to pick up later. We never discussed these few incidents outside our sections and we never asked what other MRF sections were up to. ‘What does “dealt with” mean? What do you think it means? I am not going to tell you, so don’t even ask. But occasionally people turned up with broken arms and broken legs.’ One of the cases Cursey will discuss is the killing of Patrick McVeigh.  On May 12, 1972, a two-vehicle MRF patrol approached a roadblock set up illegally by residents in Belfast’s Andersonstown area. Cursey was monitoring the MRF’s radio frequency when he heard voices and the crackle of gunfire – his colleagues were engaging the roadblock it with a sub-machine gun from an unmarked car. McVeigh was shot dead and four others were wounded. A coroner later heard that none of those men had fired weapons at MRF personnel. Cursey said: ‘I don’t know for sure if McVeigh and the others were armed but I wouldn’t be surprised if they weren’t. At the time they were manning a barricade because they wanted to control movement in their area. Occasionally we had these incidents when people on barricades – which were illegal in the first place – were shot at. Bullet holes marked on a Hillman Hunter belonging to the MRF after an IRA shootout . ‘But we’re talking about a ghetto of Belfast at two or three o’clock in the morning. People on the street said, “Oh, they were innocent,” but this  was a very hostile environment, like Afghanistan or Syria. ‘I don’t know if there will be an outcry now, I am just giving my assessment based on close contact information. I was only listening on the radio that night so I don’t think they [the HET detectives] can do me for that.’ His account also includes incidents when he and his colleagues visited notorious IRA pubs in the Crumlin Road and Falls Road areas of Belfast. On both occasions, he says members of Provisional IRA active service units were eliminated. Cursey said MRF soldiers adjusted their ‘standard operating procedures’ based on their experiences in Republican neighbourhoods, and in variance to the Rules of Engagement that British Army personnel were supposed to follow. 'I would say that we operated on the . edge of the law, and only because we had to, because the situations we . found ourselves in required us to act quickly and lethally' He said: ‘The Rules of Engagement in Northern Ireland were very clear: you were only allowed to open fire at a person actively shooting at you or someone you are with. Also, you could open fire at someone aiming a weapon but who hadn’t fired yet. We had our own slight variation on these rules. We opened fire at any small group in hard areas, neighbourhoods that even looked suspicious, armed or not – it didn’t matter. We targeted specific groups that were always up to no good. These types were sympathisers and supporters, assisting the IRA movement. ‘As far as we were concerned they were guilty by association and party to terrorist activities, leaving themselves wide open to the ultimate punishment from us. If someone was picked up and it was discovered that they were illegally armed, or that they were on our “special” wanted list of IRA killers, they could be dealt with right there in the countryside: neutralised. ‘That said, I don’t believe we ever targeted innocent civilians. I would say that we operated on the edge of the law, and only because we had to, because the situations we found ourselves in required us to act quickly and lethally. We were hunting down hardcore terrorists.’ Cursey left the MRF in 1974, the same year the unit was disbanded and replaced by the larger 14 Intelligence Company, also called ‘The Det’. A masked member of the IRA, which Cursey claims was targeted by the undercover unit . According to military sources, the MRF had been at a disadvantage because only as many as nine soldiers could deploy at any one time, with nine more on standby and the others resting. The sections were commanded by sergeants or sergeant-majors who had previously served in elite units such as the SAS, SBS, the Parachute Regiment and the Royal Marines. The MRF was based at Belfast’s Palace Barracks. Cursey, now in his early 60s, spent four years back with his parent regiment before leaving the Army. He says that in spite of the unit’s tactics being adopted by 14 Int and the SAS, the MRF has been denied the public recognition it deserves. ‘What about the SAS team that went into the Iranian Embassy, or the SAS team that took out the terrorists in Gibraltar? They were only doing what we were doing ten to 15 years earlier,’ he said. Cursey uses a pseudonym for security. His real identity is known to The Mail on Sunday and he provided this newspaper with his military identification number and a service history. The Ministry of Defence has attacked his plans to publish a book  next year. After reading the draft of MRF Shadow Troop, civil servants called for changes, including removal of the ‘mayhem and murder’ reference. Cursey has agreed to do so but maintains the MRF operated on the edge of the law. The MoD report read: ‘To suggest lethal purpose [on the part of the MRF] implies a criminal intent. For operational security reasons we do not confirm the role and function of special duties units. The MRF was bound by Rules of Engagement, the same as other units.’ A spokesman for the Police Service of Northern Ireland said it did not comment on individual cases. The MoD said: ‘Armed Forces have always served in Northern Ireland in accordance with the strict rules of engagement and subject to UK and international humanitarian law. ‘Soldiers were fully aware of the rules governing the use of force and these were reiterated in training and before operations. Specific instruction was given on the circumstances in which it was permitted to open fire. We will continue to co-operate with any investigations initiated by the Historical Enquiries Team.’ Patrick McVeigh was killed on May 12, 1972. He was said to belong to the Catholic Ex-Servicemen’s Association, whose members claimed not to take part in terrorist activities. But according to intelligence, CESA members were actively supporting the IRA. The CESA had set up illegal barricades on the outskirts of Catholic areas in Belfast and were checking everyone who approached. An MRF convoy approached and an MRF soldier fired a Thompson  sub-machine gun, killing McVeigh, 44, and wounding four others. At an inquest, an MRF soldier said the convoy had been engaged and had returned fire. Civilian eyewitnesses suggested that McVeigh and the other CESA members had been unarmed. Though Simon Cursey and other MRF soldiers were questioned by police over the McVeigh shooting, none has ever been prosecuted.","Former British soldier says unit carried out secret campaign against the IRA .

"The Ice Challenge, played properly, involves no alcohol and proceeds are donated to charities . A man has died of a heart attack after consuming a 1-litre bottle of bourbon and having his head drenched in ice cold water as part of a social media drinking game in New Zealand. Willis Tepania, a 40-year-old father from Kaitaia, took part in the game called the 'ice challenge' on Saturday night, downing a 1-litre of Jim Beam bourbon minutes after having a bucket of ice cold water thrown over her head. The New Zealand Herald has reported he suffered a cardiac arrest five hours after taking part in the now viral drinking phenomenon, which involves participants submerging themselves in ice water or having a bucket poured over their head. They then nominate others to take the challenge and make a donation to charity. But in countless online videos, the exercise is conducted hand-in-hand with alcohol. It is believed Mr Tepania fell asleep soon after his challenge and emergency services were called to to his Kaitaia home to treat him for a heart attack when he woke. Willis Tepania fell asleep for five hours before he woke and died of a heart attack as a result of the Ice Challenge game . A St John spokesman said Mr Tepania was successfully resuscitated by emergency services shortly after 3am on Sunday, and he was rushed to Kaitaia Hospital. 'He was flown to Whangarei Hospital some time later,' the spokesman told the New Zealand Herald. It is understood Mr Tepania died on Monday night. A grieving family member has warned others choosing to take part in the ice challenge to eliminate alcohol from the charitable activity. The family member, not named, said those should do it for the 'right reasons.' 'Alcohol has nothing to do with the ice challenge.' Footage of the event was taken but has since been destroyed. It is expected the man's death will be referred to the coroner. Vicki Moses, who started an ice challenge to fundraise for her five-year-old son Austin, also in Kaitaia, said drinking was not necessary. The ice challenge helped raise about $9000 for her son, who was diagnosed with leukemia in February. What started as a nomination for just three people, went viral overnight, she said. She said in the case of Mr Tepania's death, it appeared the challenge had gone too far and that was not what the game was initially intended to achieve. The Cancer Society, which benefits from the ice challenge donations, has also warned against drinking. 'Cancer Society cares about your health and well being and so does not support the consumption of alcohol as part of this challenge,' it says on one of its websites .","New Zealand man died after taking part in social media charity game .

"Britain is a nation of shop assistants, cleaners and restaurant staff despite increasingly better educated and skilled professionals, according to a new report. The top five largest single occupational groupings include 1.1 million sales and retail assistants, 600,000 cleaners and domestics and 450,000 kitchen and catering assistants, said the Jobs Economist consultancy. The 10 occupations which have expanded most over the past three years are taxation experts (up 88 per cent to 34,000), advertising accounts managers and creative directors (up 75 per cent to 33,000), window cleaners (up 73 per cent, to 47,000), planning process and production technicians (up 72 per cent to 44,000), paramedics (up 62 per cent to 22,000), psychologists (up 59 per cent to 39,000), collector salespersons and credit agents (up 59 per cent to 24,000), process and production engineers (up 58 per cent to 66,000), town planning officers (up 55 per cent to 24,000) and bakers and flour confectioners (up 54 per cent to 40,000). High street Britain: The top largest single occupational grouping is sales/retail assistants, numbering 1.1million . All these increases are much greater than the average increase in total UK employment of around 5 per cent in the corresponding period, said the report. The 10 occupations which have contracted most over the past three years are debt, rent and other cash collectors (down 52 per cent to 20,000), TV, video and audio engineers (down 46 per cent to 6,000), insurance underwriters (down 45 per cent to 20,000), social and humanities scientists (down 42 per cent to 10,000), waste disposal and environmental services managers (down 40 per cent to 13,000), floorers and wall tilers (down 39 per cent to 25,000), managers and proprietors in forestry and fishing (down 34 per cent to 8,000), quarry workers and related operatives (down 38 per cent to 9,000), rail construction and maintenance officers (down 32 per cent to 9,000) and sheet metal workers (down 33 per cent to 13,000). Tuning out: TV, video and audio engineers have dropped 6 per cent to 6,000. File picture . Cleaning up: The number of window cleaners has risen by 73 per cent, to 47,000 . Dr John Philpott, director of the Jobs Economist, said: 'Our complex and fluid occupational structure explains why there are so many conflicting views on how the British way of work is changing. 'From one perspective it's clear that so-called 'knowledge work' is firmly on the rise, requiring a high level of professional and technical skill and offering decent pay prospects. 'Yet equally apparent is a substantial bedrock of low skill, low wage service work which accounts for the UK's relatively high incidence of low pay, with around one in five (five million) employees earning less than the commonly used low pay threshold for developed economies. 'While with considerable justification we like to portray ourselves as a nation of increasingly better educated and skilled professionals, we could also reasonably be described as a nation of shop assistants, cleaners and restaurant or cafe washer-uppers.'","There are 1.1million sales and retail assistants in Britain .

"The official Student Loans Company has been accused of using ‘Wonga tactics’ to harass thousands of graduates who are behind on their repayments. It has invented a fictional firm – Smith Lawson and Company Recovery Services – which adopts the same threatening language as private debt firms and solicitors to chase payments. The tactic appears similar to an approach taken by the payday lender Wonga, which was last week ordered to pay £2.6million in compensation after sending letters to thousands of customers from made-up debt recovery firms. The Student Loans Company is a subsidiary of the Government and reports to Vince Cable's Department for Business, Innovation and Skills . Both sets of revelations have triggered calls for a police inquiry into what appears to be evidence of mis-representation and harassment. Warnings sent by ‘Smith Lawson and Company’ to graduates for the last nine years carry a banner in red stating ‘Do Not Ignore This Letter’, with a demand for payment within seven days and a threat of legal action. They gave the impression of a separate company with the line: ‘We are instructed by our client, in connection with the sum outstanding shown above.’ But the supposed firm does not exist and is little more than a masthead designed to intimidate. The Student Loans Company (SLC) is a subsidiary of the Government and reports to Vince Cable’s  Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. Threat: An extract from the letter sent to graduates . The firm said it introduced Smith Lawson as a ‘cost-saving exercise’ because the use of conventional debt collection agencies required payment of commission. Last week City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) revealed Wonga would have to pay £2.6million compensation to 45,000 people sent letters from two invented debt recovery firms. Subsequently, City of London Police said it would investigate whether the lender and its millionaire founders had committed any criminal offences under a number of possible headings. These range from the Fraud Act – which states it is a crime to dishonestly make a false representation intending to make a gain or cause loss to another – and the Administration of Justice Act, which protects those in debt from harassment. There are also possible offences under the Solicitors Act of 1974, which makes it an offence for someone to falsely imply they are a solicitor, and sections of the Theft Act which cover demanding money with menaces. Consumer groups and lawyers say any evidence a government firm is adopting the same tactics at Wonga should mean it is also brought into the police investigation. The SLC has been sending out warning letters under the Smith Lawson name since at least 2005, suggesting tens of thousands will have been issued, not least because the number of former students who are in arrears is rising sharply. The bullying approach was backed up in Smith Lawson’s training manual which told staff that if people refused to pay ‘then the threat of legal action should be used’, including seeking a County Court Judgment. It advised: ‘The threat of a Debt Collection Agency should also be used, explaining that someone  could actually call round to speak to them personally.’ The total amount owed by all students ballooned to £54.4billion in 2013/14 following the introduction of £9,000-a-year tuition fees in 2012. At the same time, the arrears soared from £12.7million to £38.2million. Last week City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority revealed Wonga would have to pay £2.6million compensation to 45,000 people sent letters from two invented debt recovery firms . Last night Marc Gander, founder of the Consumer Action Group, said: ‘When we find that Wonga tactics are being used by a lender which is so close to government … it shows very clearly how out of control the lending industry really is. We can only hope that the  Student Loans Company faces a criminal investigation as well.’ Yesterday, the SLC said newer Smith Lawson letters no longer refer to the SLC as the ‘client’, adding: ‘Smith Lawson is a trading name for the Student Loans Company and this is made clear on all relevant correspondence to customers. Our communications were agreed with the Office for Fair Trading.’","Student Loans Company has been accused of using 'Wonga tactics'

"When Ishita Malaviya began surfing at the age of 18 she was the only female in the water. She had just moved to a small south west coastal town called Manipal, from the big city of Mumbai, to study journalism in 2007, when a chance encounter with a German exchange student saw her lay her eyes on a surfboard for the first time. Back then surf shops didn't exist and the idea of a woman going anywhere near one was taboo. Local people, who believe fair skin equates to beauty, were also not used to seeing a young woman get tanned and mocked Malaviya for her colour. ‘A lot of my friends and professors would say ""Ishita you have become so dark, so black, you look like charcoal"". ‘I said ""are you serious? You think I’m ugly?"" That was a little disturbing,’ she told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Ishita Malaviya began surfing seven years ago and had never touched a real surfboard before then . The 25-year-old now runs her own surfshop and is sponsored by international surf brand Roxy . Fast forward seven years, and Malaviya is posing for photoshoots and sponsored by huge international surf brand Roxy. She also runs her own surf shop with her architect boyfriend, after they both ditched promising professional careers to pursue their passion for the sport. This Friday, India’s first female surfer will make more waves as a documentary film about her gender boundary-breaking achievements, filmed by award winning cinematographer Dave Homcy, screens at  Byron Bay Surf Festival, in NSW. In the movie Malaviya travels with an international group of female surfers including Byron Bay resident Lauren Hill, American director Crystal Thornburg-Homcy, conservationist Liz Clark, humanitarian Emi Koch, and yoga teacher Kate Baldwin. The women approached Malaviya to travel with them through Southern India as they documented the ways in which surfing, as well as yoga and ecological creativity, are helping the local people. An international group of female surfers, including Australia's Lauren Hill, American director Crystal Thornburg-Homcy, conservationist Liz Clark, humanitarian Emi Koch, and yoga teacher Kate Baldwin, came to India to meet Malaviya . 'Naturally people are apprehensive about women getting in the water,’ Malaviya says in the documentary . India's first female surfer will make more waves as a documentary film about her gender boundary-breaking achievements screens at Byron Bay Surf Festival . Hill, who splits her time between her childhood home in Florida and the world-class point breaks of Byron Bay, told Daily Mail Australia the film is 'the story of five women travelling to India and meeting up with India's first recognised female surfer'. 'We are basically going and looking for surf while also volunteering at various orphanages and schools where we share surfing with young kids.' ‘The ocean has always been a place for the men, they go fish at sea and the women stay at home and it’s never been a place for them so naturally people are apprehensive about women getting in the water,’ Malaviya says as the documentary opens. Malaviya still clearly remembers the first time she defied social norms and got in the water. ‘It was really awesome. I hadn’t had that much fun in a really long time, I felt like a kid again. I remember smiling a lot and thinking “yay I am going to do this for the rest of my life”.' Malaviya left Mumbai to go to university by the coast and relished the chance to be out of the 'crowded and polluted' city and on the 'clean and empty beaches' In the documentary Beyond The Surface the saturated hues of India set the scene . The film touches on youth and women's empowerment and personal growth . 'When girls hit puberty families restrict them as they don't want them in the water with other boys,' Malaviya explained . The 25-year-old relished the chance to be out of the ‘crowded and polluted’ city of Mumbai and on the ‘clean and empty beaches’. But that doesn’t mean she found surfing easy to begin with. ‘I sucked, I was really weak because honestly in India our school didn’t promote sports, it was mainly academic… I would get beat up black and blue. The guys were much stronger with their upper body, ‘ she said. She also faced worried questions from her friends and family about what she was doing with her life . ‘First of all our parents didn’t understand the lifestyle. They were like “you tried it once, why did you do it again?”.’ Malaviya began getting up early every morning to surf and she and her boyfriend Tushar Pathiyan sold most of their possessions to buy the German student’s surfboard once he left India. ‘When we started it was completely unheard of in the country, even if you Googled surfing it wouldn’t show up,’ Malaviya explained. India's first female surfer has been supported by the male surfing community in India, who ask her to surf in local contests . Yoga teacher Kate Baldwin first stepped onto a surfboard on a yoga vacation to Hawaii . The film was co-directed by American Dave Homcy, who moved to Hawaii, following his passion for surf cinematography and photography . Lauren Hill will be at the Byron Bay Surf Festival when Beyond The Surface is shown this weekend . The more she suffered, the darker her skin got. Malaviya began having to face comments about the way she looked and her role as woman as well as her career choice. ‘In India dark skin is looked down upon. People think fair skin is beauty. A lot of women have tried surfing and enjoy it but one of the biggest reasons they don’t do it again is because they don’t want to get dark,’ Malaviya said. ‘Also, when girls hit puberty families restrict them as they don’t want them in the water with other boys.’ However, as time has gone on Malaviya has seen a change. Just recently she met a mother in the water and now a handful of women are surfing regularly. She has also been supported by the male surfing community in India, who ask her to surf in local contests. On top of that, she has been inspired to continue her mission to get more women in the water after travelling with the group of international female surfers for the film. ‘I just loved how bold and fearless they are, and I like that they are much more free spirited. They just have that energy, it’s really positive.’ Director Crystal Thornburg-Homcy Born was born and raised surfing in Hawaii. Her dad used to push her into waves at Waikiki and by elementary school her mum was taking her to the beach to surf after school . Malaviya began getting up early every morning to surf despite it being unheard of for a woman in India . She and her boyfriend Tushar Pathiyan sold most of their possessions to buy the German student's surfboard once he left India .

Malaviya may have now won her battle for a place in the water but this week she is faced with a new problem – obtaining a visa in time to make it to Australia for the Byron Bay Film Festival where her story will be shown to a captive ocean-loving audience. ‘I’ve heard about this stuff [Australian surfing] for so long it would be so nice to be there. ‘When you are in India and you start surfing, when there is no surfing, the only way you can be inspired is to watch it online and learn. ‘The best surfers are in Australia – they are the ones we looked up to, they've got the vibe and surf culture there too.’ The film Beyond The Surface and the charity Beyond The Surface International, whose mission is to use surfing as a tool to help homeless and orphaned children, will feature at Byron Bay Surf Festival from October 24 -26. 'Emi Koch's idea is that surfing is an incredible tool for bringing joy, enviromental values and community develeopment in areas where those areas are desperatly needed,' Hill said . Director Dave Homcy is an expert in surf films and has previously worked on Sliding Liberia, Shelter, A Broke Down Melody, Surfwise, Come Hell Or High Water, and the TV shows Lost and Hawaii 5-0 .

"When William Straw, a grocer, died suddenly in 1932, his grief-stricken widow and sons decided to leave their house exactly as he knew it. Decorated in 1923, the redbrick Worksop semi then remained just as it was until the last Straw to live there, Mr Straw's son William junior, died and bequeathed it to the National Trust in 1991. The rooms are painted in the dark colours fashionable at the time, gilt-framed oil paintings hang from picture rails, and the larder is full of Bovril and tinned sardines. Scroll down for video . Glimpse of a more formal age: The redbrick semi in Worksop offers a fascinating glimpse of suburban family life in Britain between the wars . National Trust propertyi: Number 7 Blyth Grove in Worksop still looks just as it did in 1923 when the Straw family decorated it . Tinned herrings, anyone? The larder reflects the palate of a different age: tinned new potatoes, tinned sardines, and jars and jars of Bovril . Owned by the National Trust since the family of grocers who lived there passed it on, it is one of the Trust's more unusual properties, and all the more fascinating for it. There are no expensive treasures or rare antiques; instead the house, known as Mr Straw's House, offers an authentic glimpse into how an ordinary British family lived a century ago. Built in 1905, it was the home of the Straws, a grocer family headed by William Straw senior and his wife, Florence. The couple, who had two sons, William and Walter, decorated it in 1923 in the style of the day, with dark and heavy wallpaper, patterned carpets, dark wooden furniture and thick curtains to keep out the cold. William Straw senior ran a thriving . grocery and seed business, and his younger son Walter joined him in the . business while William junior left to teach in London where he made a . considerable fortune by investing in Marks & Spencer shares. A well-to-do local family, they lived a quiet, respectable and well-ordered life until 1932 when Mr Straw senior died suddenly at the age of 68.  In their grief, the family decided nothing would be changed. Roll-top baths first time around: A pumice, bar of Pears soap and scrubbing brush lie in the wooden bath rack, near the ornate sink . How we lived 90 years ago: The dining room has dark painted walls, gilt-framed oil paintings hanging from a picture rail, and working fireplace . No modern appliances here: The kitchen at 7 Blyth Grove has a working fire, butler's sink and wooden larder, while the kettle and the iron heat up on the stove . Today's ultra-modern kitchen needs a vast range - in the 1920s, a small stove was sufficient to feed the whole family . A 1932 calendar still hangs in the dining room.  His pipe and tobacco pouch still hang beside the . fireplace, and in the hall, his hats and coats remain on their pegs. In 1938, William Straw junior came back to live at Blyth Grove, and the following year his mother died. After that, the two brothers lived there until 1985, though no modern touches were ever added. Their mother's bedroom was left untouched from her death in 1939, and no television set, radio, gramophone or telephone was ever allowed over the threshold. The house of a family who lived comfortably: The Straws were a well-to-do family of grocers and seed merchants who lived at Blyth Grove for decades . A bedroom from yesteryear: After Mr Straw senior's death, the piano was moved into Mrs Straw's pretty bedroom, where it remained . A happy couple, remembered forever: Mr and Mrs Straw lived at the Worksop house until Mr Straw died in 1932 and his wife seven years later . Untouched for decades: Mr Straw's flat caps and felt trilbies are hung above rows of identical raincoats in the hall of the solidly-constructed Midlands semi . The brothers lived there harmoniously and peacefully; William ran the house and his brother cycled into Worksop every day to open up the shop. They followed a rigid routine for 40 . years, parsimonious with their money, never throwing anything away,and hoarding an eclectic mix of possessions which now give a fascinating . insight to their lives. William Straw lived at the house until 1985 and died in 1990, while his brother died some years before. With no heir, he bequeathed the house to the National Trust, which decided to leave it exactly as it was. Danielle Brown, house and visitor manager, said: 'It offers the public a unique insight into family life between the wars.' Preserved for decades: The Straw brothers hoarded everything and stored it meticulously away in the red-brick suburban house . From an age when things were made to last: Beautifully polished, although missing one of the original laces, Mr Straw's black leather shoes are still pristine . The wooden cupboard in the kitchen suffers from woodworm but still bears groceries bought decades ago, while the old-fashioned scales haven't weighed anything for decades . Old letters with painstakingly-typed addresses lie in a metal letter tray - they look to have been opened by a letter-opener .","The suburban semi-detached house at 7 Blyth Grove, Worksop, was the home of the Straw family, who were grocers .

"A couple of days after my first son was born, I remember watching him sleep. His parachute-silk eyelids dropped over his eyes. He was full from his last feed, his breathing scarcely more than a contented whisper. He looked so assuredly at peace with the world. There was a lump in my throat from the overwhelming love I felt for this new person who I had nurtured and protected inside me for nine months, and was now out in the world. As each week went by, I felt more and more attached to Zek as we formed an incredibly close bond.But all that changed when the four-month-long paid maternity leave from my newspaper job came to an end. I loved my work, needed the money, and therefore didn't feel I had a choice over whether or not to go back. So I did what every mother at this difficult moment does: I found a good childminder and convinced myself my son would be fine. Over the years Angela has felt the need to prove to Zek (r) that he is important to her and loved . And was he fine? Physically, yes. Emotionally, however, I'm not so sure. In fact, I am convinced that the abrupt break in the bonding process between us had a profound and enduring effect, and may still be having an effect - even though he's a now a 37-year-old father himself. I am also convinced that because I never left my younger son, Cato, born four-and-a-half years later in 1980, and was a constant presence throughout his childhood, he is the secure, loving and easy-going man he is today. I have found myself recalling those difficult, guilt-ridden days as a young working parent as debate rages about George Osborne's recent budget. A host of tax allowances that favour working over 'stay-at-home' mothers has provoked fury, and I think rightly so. Forcing mothers back to work when they do not feel their child is ready, is cruel and destructive for all concerned. What has become lost amid the political battle is what it means for a child to have their mother with them, rather than a stand-in who, however loving, can never understand and love them as much. While researching her book Angela realised it is vital for children to feel bonded to their caregiver . When my maternity leave was up and I returned to work in February 1976, Zek became clingy and fretful, crying anxiously if I so much as left the room. It didn't just happen when he was left with the childminder when I went to work; at weekends it was the same when I was only moving from room to room. As he grew into a toddler, there were tantrums and fits of defiant anger that continued for years.During his school days, he would stamp around declaring he was 'rubbish'. Other times he just seemed sad and withdrawn. Leaving Zek was not, I now see, simply a matter of finding high-quality childcare. He was certainly well looked after - and is still in contact with his childminder. It was, I realise, a double whammy. Not only did he lose me when I was at work, he also lost me, in a sense, when I was at home. You see, Zek did not have me, the person who had represented fundamental security since his birth, the person he relied on, to help him navigate this big, overwhelming and sometimes frightening new world. Exhausted from my demanding newspaper job, I often arrived back home drained and frazzled and not up to empathetic parenting. At this point, my husband Olly was also working long  and unpredictable hours in the film business. At the time, I didn't know much about the meaning of attachment. But writing about children's psychological problems and researching for my book A Home For The Heart, I came to understand it is vital for children to feel bonded to the person ultimately responsible for caring for them. If you don't, as my personal experience shows, children can suffer for the rest of their lives. I believe it is crucial for a mother or a father, who has been very involved from the beginning, to provide a loving, secure and constant presence while babies navigate that first year. I started working from home as a freelance writer when Zek was two-and-a-half. I made the difficult decision to sacrifice my job to care for him, with help, at home because I had begun to fear that Zek's worrying behavioural traits were caused by my lack of time for him. But even though we began to spend more time together, he remained guarded and, as he became articulate, fiercely critical of me. It was as though the abrupt severing of the bond we had developed so early on continued to be an unconscious force. How different all this was with my second son. Cato, who was born four years after Zek, when I was already working from home. He slotted into a life where I was  virtually a constant presence. Yes, we had au pairs or helpers who came in during the day, but I could be around if needed and I broke from work at tea time to be with the boys until they went to bed. If necessary, I worked into the night to meet deadlines.I believe the attachment Cato had with me - without a sudden break - gave him an entirely different quality of security. Etched on my memory is a lovely image of him as a baby in his bouncy chair in the garden with me working contentedly alongside him. He was so at ease, and unlike Zek, not at all worried if I came or went. He was benignly accepting, secure and good natured. I can  never recall feeling seriously concerned about him in the way I had with Zek during his childhood. Zek was far more often a worry. Cato's deep sense of security enabled him to become independent of me and Olly at his own pace, to develop sociability and the desire to be with other children, and be without me. He has always been trusting and emotionally open, whereas his brother is far less so, even to this day. Zek has always been cautious and secretive with us. I knew nothing of the relationships he might have had as a young man, and it was only when things were serious between them that he introduced his future wife. Cato on the other hand wrote 'I love Emily' behind the bath when, aged six, he was infatuated with a girl at school. Angela pictured with Zek as a teenager (far left), husband Olly and younger son Cato . Since then he has poured out tales of passions, sobbed on my shoulder at big break-ups and is demonstrably loving with his fiancee in front of us. Most importantly, Cato has always seemed to trust that his world was a happy place and I know deep down that is because I didn't abandon him to get back to work too early in that precious first year.So I believe fervently that we must not penalise mothers who want to stay with their children until they judge they are ready to be left. Thankfully, there is a happy ending to my story with Zek. Over the years I have felt the need to prove to him that he is important to me and unconditionally loved. As he has grown to adulthood, I have discussed this with him - apologised in fact - for what I believe was a traumatic event for a four-month-old to endure. He, of course, is unaware of any damage done. But the point about damaged attachment is that it is unconscious. Even now he can suddenly become emotionally unsettled for no apparent reason. Our relationship has grown much stronger and warmer over recent years. Then, a couple of years ago when his wife was pregnant he asked if they might rent the first floor of our home because they would like to be near family. We all live together to this day. Their daughter, Isana, is almost two and I watch my son, so involved with her, so close and loving, and when he said to me the other day how happy he is that she has a warm and affectionate relationship with me, I felt that finally I could relax. Things have come right. But it has been a long and painful journey, which is why I feel so strongly that the Government must learn to value mothers who stay at home with their children. The job they do is invaluable. And lasts a lifetime.","Anglea Neustatter felt more and more attached to first son baby Zek .

"Curious toddlers can end up in the strangest of places when they learn to walk and start exploring. But the mother of this youngster was shocked to turn around while cleaning and find her daughter stuck fast in a bucket. Little Minnie Snodgrass had to be removed by firemen after clambering into the pail while her mother, Gemma, was mopping the kitchen floor of the family home in Conisborough, South Yorkshire. Minnie Snodgrass got herself wedged in a bucket while her mother, Gemma, was cleaning the kitchen. She eventually had to be removed by firemen after being taken to hospital . Mrs Snodgrass said she popped upstairs for a moment before finding her 16-month-old giggling in the bucket. 'She must have climbed in, sat down and got wedged. I had just mopped the kitchen floor and emptied the bucket,' she explained. 'I went upstairs and I heard Minnie's four-year-old brother Matthew shout ""Mum, Minnie's stuck"". I picked up the bucket and panicked when I couldn't get her out.' Mrs Snodgrass's mum, Rose Cope, 54, came to the rescue and drove them to Montagu Hospital in Mexborough, South Yorkshire. Mrs Snodgrass said: 'Minnie looked quite content as she sat waving her arms and dancing in the bucket. 'She barely let out a whimper the whole time, she actually seemed to enjoy being stuck and was dancing around in the back of the car.' Minnie recreates the moment she got stuck by sitting in a new bucket the family have bought to make sure the issue doesn't happen again . Mrs Snodgrass said Minnie stayed remarkably calm during the incident and even seemed to enjoy the fuss . When they arrived, hospital staff rang the fire service to help. Four firemen then used bolt cutters to remove the youngster, being careful not to hurt the little girl. Thankfully, Minnie escaped the experience unhurt and her family say she even seemed to enjoy the experience. Hairdresser Mrs Snodgrass said: 'It was so embarrassing walking in, I said to my mum that she would have to carry her in, which she did. 'When we got to the counter my mum plonked the bucket on the desk and said ""she's stuck"". 'At first the receptionist said they couldn't help us and that we should call the fire brigade, but eventually one of the nurses called out and said it wasn't fair to have people laughing at us, so brought us to a back room and called the fire brigade.' She added: 'They were really nice about it. When they first arrived they said ""We've never seen anything like this before"". 'But they were trying to keep Minnie calm, telling her to keep still and that everything would be all right. 'My mum was talking to Minnie as well as she started to get a bit upset because she didn't know who the fire crew were. 'I'll definitely have to keep a closer eye on her in the future as getting stuck definitely hasn't stopped her wanting to explore and climb things. She was back to her usual self straight away afterwards.' A South Yorkshire Fire spokesman said: 'We're delighted Minnie is safe and well and hope she is recovering from her ordeal. 'This is one of thousands of special service incidents we attend each year. If we weren't here to rescue toddlers from mop buckets, who would?'","Minnie Snodgrass climbed into bucket while mum, Gemma, was cleaning .

The Crown Solicitor's opinion was not sought. The charge is now withdrawn - within 24 hours of Mr Rudd's first appearance in Court,' he said. 'Mr Rudd has suffered unnecessary and extremely damaging publicity as a result of widespread and sensational reporting of a very serious allegation, which on any basis was never justified.' 'The damage to Mr Rudd is incalculable. Questions arise as to the degree of care taken by those responsible for arresting and charging him with Attempting to Procure Murder,' 'Citizens are entitled to a responsible exercise of the power to charge which, as is proved here, can give rise to potentially irreversible damage if that power is not exercised responsibly,' 'Mr Rudd is considering any possible remedies he may have,' he finished.

Earlier, the man allegedly hired as a hitman by Rudd said he was asked to become his bodyguard after the rocker said he was threatened for not paying 'working girls'. The alleged hitman, whose name has been suppressed, told The Sydney Morning Herald in an exclusive interview, that Rudd was the 'Hugh Hefner of Tauranga' claiming that the amount he spent on 'company is like someone's yearly wage'.The man told Fairfax Media: 'The girls that he gets, working girls and that, they're p***ed off, he tells them ""Nah I'm not paying you"" and then the partners come and say they want their money.'

The Daily Telegraph reported that the man went on fishing and helicopter trips with Rudd who also allowed him to drive his flashy sports cars. He added that although Rudd was burning his bridges with those 'who care about him' he was still a 'good fella' with a 'big heart'. 'You’ve got to feel sorry for him – just the expectations everyone has of him,' he said. When Daily Mail Australia contacted the band's ex-manager, Michael Browning, he had only just heard the news and said it was a 'bit of a shock, but there you go'.

The ageing rocker was silent during a brief, shoeless appearance in Tauranga District Court that afternoon and has been released on bail until his next appearance on November 27. According to court documents, Rudd was accused of attempting to hire one person to kill two others between September 25 and September 26. That charge has since been dropped. He is also accused of threatening to kill a complainant on September 26.

'To see someone deteriorate as much as he has is quite alarming.' The Australian-born drummer has lived in Tauranga for a number of years. He first moved to New Zealand in 1983 after being sacked by the band, but hooked up with the band again in 1994.

"This is the moment a man dressed as 'Friday The 13th' slasher Jason Voorhees was dragged out of a  city centre pub by armed police after locals mistook his  fancy dress knife for a real machete. Shaun McKeon, from Leeds, West Yorkshire, was dressed up as the hockey mask-wearing horror villain  for a themed fancy dress party last Friday - the 13th - complete with toy wooden knives. Mr McKeon, 26, said him and his friends were 'all quite big horror fans' and he  decided to model his costume on Friday The 13th Part VI. In the film Jason wears a  utility belt with fake weapons including a machete, hunting knife and throwing  darts. Scroll down for video . Unlucky for some: Shaun McKeon, dressed as Friday The 13th slasher Jason Voorhees, was bundled to the floor and handcuffed by armed police officers after someone called 999 - fearing his fake weapons were real . Firearm: The officer on the left appears to have drawn his handgun as the 'suspect' is led away down an alley . But armed response officers were dispatched after police received reports that 'a  masked man was walking around Leeds city centre carrying what appeared to be  knives at 5.25pm'. Officers found him at the Angel Inn, pinning him  to the ground and handcuffing him before pulling him towards police cars. Mr McKeon said the officers had tasers and he feared he was going to get shocked . Mr McKeon explained: 'I was at The Angel Inn drinking for a good  half an hour before the police turned up in force with guns and dogs. 'Though I was still in costume they managed to walk right past me twice before  I gathered that they were there because of the fake weapons I had brought, so I  handed my bag to the plain-clothes officer to be checked. 'At this point it was quite obvious to all, including the plain-clothes officer,  that I posed no threat whatsoever but the police still dragged me to the ground  and cuffed me anyway.' He added he has gone out dressed in the same costume many times before without incident. Mr McKeon, who makes horror costumes as a hobby, accepted the knives looked authentic but believes the police should have used some common sense. He said: The costume does look realistic. But I have been out like this many times before and this has never happened. 'I think the police should have really used a bit of sense. 'When I got on the bus I said to the driver these aren't real and he said ""yeah I got that"".' He claims that when police arrived at the pub, a plain-clothed officer emptied his bag of weapons and brushed his hand over them. Shaun said: 'He seemed happy with that but then his friends came over, hauled me off the bench and handcuffed me. They had tasers and I thought I was going to get shocked, I think some of them had beanbag guns. 'After handcuffing me they took me on to the street and searched me before finally letting me go. 'The whole thing probably lasted about 25 minutes and after they were happy the knives were fake they let me go and we carried on our night out.' A drinker who saw the scene unfold said: 'It all felt a bit heavy-handed really, he was just a lad in fancy dress' A barman . at the pub, who did not wish to be named, told: 'The police rang and . asked if we knew of anyone wearing a Friday 13th Jason outfit, they said . there  had been reports of this guy carrying a machete through town. 'We told them he was at the pub, and the next thing we knew, they were here  looking for him.' The unemployed 26-year-old horror fan with the fake weapons and the mask from his costume . Liz . Goodwill, 53, of Leeds, who was drinking on the benches outside the . pub,  said: 'This guy was drinking with around half a dozen friends . outside the pub. 'We weren't really paying attention to him, they looked like students just  having a couple of drinks. 'The . next thing I knew, around five police officers, wearing armour vests, . bullet-proof vests, and with two police Alsatian dogs, were running down . the  alleyway to the pub. 'This . guy was shouting, ""I haven't done anything wrong"". But they pulled him . away and up towards the police cars which were parked at the top of the . alley. 'It all felt a bit heavy-handed really, he was just a lad in fancy dress.' West Yorkshire Police have since issued a warning about the 'distress' caused  by carrying toy weapons in public. Superintendent . Sam Miller of Leeds District Police said: 'This incident took  place . during a two hour period in Leeds in which officers were deployed to a . number of genuine emergencies including serious assaults, domestic . incidents,  road traffic collisions and searches for missing people, . which gives an  indication of how busy we frequently are. 'Residents . quite rightly phoned us to inform us they had seen a man carrying  what . appeared to be knives and as a result we had to dispatch critical . resources to locate this individual. 'These were resources which could have been better deployed dealing with  genuine emergencies.' Horror fan: Shaun McKeon poses for the camera in his outfit before going out. The 26-year-old was dressed as the killer Jason Voorhees, the evil protagonist of the Friday The 13th movies . Not dangerous: Mr McKeon said it was obvious he presented to danger to anyone, but he was still handcuffed, pinned and marched to a police car. But officers said this sort of incident wastes police time . He added: 'Officers were able to locate him and after checking the items he was carrying  were toys he was dealt with and given suitable advice. 'We would remind everyone that carrying toy weapons in these circumstances can  cause real distress as the items may well be mistaken by residents for the real  thing, as in this case. 'Such items should not be displayed and anyone who does so can expect to be  stopped by police and appropriately dealt with'","Shaun McKeon was at a horror-themed fancy dress party at a Leeds pub .

"Around three years old and holding a gun, this little boy is terrifying proof of how the Taliban is reasserting its grip on Afghanistan. As Western troops prepare to leave the country after 13 years of war, sinister footage has emerged from one of the fanatics’ strongholds. In the film, obtained by the BBC, the toddler declares: ‘I’m going to shoot people.’ Scroll down for video . Indoctrinated: The boy (right) lives in the Tangi Valley, just an hour's drive from the Afghan capital Kabul . Other clips show fighters with their faces covered, posing with guns and rocket launchers. The Taliban has been using the Tangi Valley – just an hour’s drive from the capital Kabul – as a staging post for attacks as it tries to seize back the whole country. Fighters are undergoing training in how to use advanced weaponry and identify targets using Google maps, while children are being indoctrinated in schools. A BBC Panorama investigation to be screened tonight also shows Taliban governor Mawlawi Badri, one of the most wanted men in Afghanistan. He tells Inside The Taliban: ‘The people are Muslim and want an Islamic government. Westerners don’t want an Islamic government here, the ones we scare and kill are the enemies of this land.’ The Taliban and its allies have stepped up attacks ahead of the withdrawal of most foreign troops in the coming weeks, including UK forces. They are seeking to weaken the new Afghan government that will take over most of the operations against them. Investigation: The images are in footage handed to the BBC's Panorama in an episode to be screened tonight . Operating under the name of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, the Taliban has already set up its own shadow government structure. While the militants’ control runs through every aspect of life in the valley – including the courts system which upholds sharia law – it is particularly evident in schools. Mohammad Salem, head teacher of the Imam Abu Hanifa School, which has 1,400 male pupils, said: ‘The Taliban make sure the students attend school. 'If a student misbehaves they punish them. The Taliban has always supported us against unruly students.’ When the pupils are asked about their hopes for the future, one says: ‘To serve my country, to serve Islam.’ Another says: ‘To help the poor according to the Koran and the teachings of the Prophet Mohammed – and these invaders who came should leave.’ The school is funded from Kabul – and much of the money for education comes from the West, including from Britain.","Film obtained by BBC shows young child playing with gun in Afghanistan .

"Two friends have circumnavigated the globe in 80 days – recreating the fictional journey made by Phileas Fogg. But Milan Bihlmann and Muammer Yilmaz’s adventure was made even more extraordinary given that they didn’t spend a penny of their own money completing the challenge. After setting off from Paris on September 9, the pair managed to travel through countries including Austria, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, India, the US and Singapore by persuading travel companies to provide free train tickets and airfares. Milan Bihlmann and Muammer Yilmaz arrive back in Paris after completing their epic 80-day adventure . They also managed to hitchhike between destinations and were offered free accommodation by strangers they met along the way.

"U.S. airports, including Los Angeles International and O'Hare International in Chicago, are already experiencing delays in customs waiting lines as a result of automatic federal spending cuts, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said today. In New York today, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said wait times for passengers on 56 arriving flights at JFK International exceeded two hours, and passengers on 14 flights waited more than three hours. CBP said in a statement later Monday that weekend delays in Los Angeles and Chicago were caused by ""reduced primary booth staffing"" because of cuts to overtime. Delays: Passengers seen lining up in Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, amid delayed wait times due to spending cuts . Delays at Miami International Airport of more than two hours were reported for 51 flights, and passengers from four flights experienced waits of about three hours. CBP said such waits were longer than usual.

"It is not just Scotland on the verge of breaking away from the UK - a small pocket of South Yorkshire could go with it. The town of Doncaster could be left if limbo if the Scots vote for independence, due a historical quirk which means it is officially part of Scotland. The Yorkshire town was taken by the Scots in the 12th century when King David I seized vast swathes of northern England and it was signed over by King Stephen of England in the first Treaty of Durham. English monarch Henry II and his forces regained control of the area 21 years later, but historians say Doncaster - dubbed 'Bonny Donny' by some Scots - was never formally given back. Scroll down for video . Historians say the South Yorkshire town of Doncaster is technically part of Scotland due to an historic quirk . The matter has always been treated as an historical anomaly by locals, but it could become relevant if Scotland decides to split the union today. Describing the background to the claim, Local historian Dr Charles Kelham said: 'David had invaded England in support of his niece, the Empress Matilda, the widow of a Roman Emperor whose claim to the throne of England seemed to have rather more justification than [then-King] Stephen's. 'Stephen bought David off at the meeting in Durham by offering him a selection of additional estates, one of which was the manor and soke of Doncaster. It was a sweetener, effectively.' Prince Henry of Scotland is credited with shaping the history of the town and formally establishing Doncaster as a borough, but the prince predeceased his father in 1152, and David himself died the year after. While records indicate the area had reverted to the English crown by 1156, there is no documentary evidence of a formal return of the land. The town was taken by Scottish King David I (left) but later seized back by English monarch Henry II (right) Buildings in Doncaster, which still has strong links to Scotland, have flown the Saltire in recent weeks . Dr Kelham added: 'The arrangement did not last long, but it is right it appears that there was never any official giving back.' The issue is of interest to Labour leader and Doncaster North Ed Miliband, who could become a so-called 'ghost MP' representing a 'Scottish seat' if a Yes vote is returned, it has jokingly been suggested. He said: 'It's an interesting quirk of history. Doncaster is a great place and Scotland is a great country, as part of the same nation the two have a great deal to offer each other.' Doncaster's mayor Ros Jones added: 'Doncaster has strong historic links with Scotland, including the Scottish miners who came to work in the borough. 'Like many other local authorities, the council flew the Scottish flag at the weekend in solidarity for the Union. I think we are better together.' 1135 - Henry I of England dies and is succeeded by his nephew, Stephen of England (pictured, right). This angers Scotland which supported Henry's daughter Matilda. In December that year, Scottish King David I invades northern England . 1136 - Stephen and David sign peace treaty in Durham with gives David parts of Cumberland, Lancashire and Doncaster. 1139 - River Tees declared Scottish border after continued fighting. 1153 - King David of Scotland dies in Carlisle. He is succeeded by his grandson Malcolm IV (Malcolm the Maiden), who inherits Northumberland. 1154 - Henry II takes English throne from Stephen and, despite early promises to let David keep his territories in the north, he reclaims northern England, allowing Scotland to keep only Tynedale.

"Seventy years ago today Britain’s first front-line jet fighter took to the skies at the height of the Second World War. Almost 4,000 Meteors were built and they were exported to serve with countries around the world during a time when Britain truly ruled the skies. And this month one of the last Meteors still in airworthy condition – the oldest flyable British jet in the world – will take to the air over Cornwall to mark the opening of a new museum at Newquay Airport, the former RAF St Mawgan. Seventy years ago today Britain's first front-line jet fighter - the Gloster Meteor -  took to the skies at the height of the Second World War . Almost 4,000 Meteors were built and they were exported to serve with countries around the world . The Gloster Meteor was the Allies’ first operational jet, with sorties starting in July 1944 with 616 Squadron. Designed by George Carter, the prototype took off in secrecy from RAF Cranwell in Lincolnshire on March 5, 1943. Meteors were first based at RAF Culmhead in Somerset but were soon moved to Manston in Kent, closer to the action above occupied Europe and ready to intercept the dreaded German Luftwaffe. The aircraft was quickly sent up to combat the menace of V-1 flying bombs, pilotless pulse-jet projectiles that were the forerunners of today’s cruise missiles. They were fired from the Continent to later crash to earth over southern England. With a top speed of more than 400mph, Meteors notched up their first ‘kills’ of V-1s in August 1944. Initially created as a single-seater, pilots used to piston-engined, propeller-driven aircraft had to quickly get to grips with their new Meteors. Many aircrew would be instantly taken by the lack of the spinning propeller they were used to seeing at the front of their Spitfires and Hurricane fighters. They were also amazed at the quieter engines – at least from the cockpit; the noise outside being deafening to bystanders. By 1949 dual controlled Meteors were being produced which enabled flying instructors to ease the transition from propeller to jet aircraft. By the end of the war 16 RAF squadrons were equipped with Meteor F3s and soon after the F4 version was flown, which was 170mph faster than its predecessor. By 1951 there were 20 RAF squadrons flying the Meteor and it became one of the best-loved aircraft in the air force inventory. By the end of the war 16 RAF squadrons were equipped with Meteor F3s and soon after the F4 version was flown, which was 170mph faster than its predecessor . Legendary post-war test pilot Bill Waterton, in his memoirs The Quick and the Dead, described his first impression of the new jet fighters as a poor one, saying the low-powered early variants ‘often seemed touch and go whether they would take off or not’. But he grew to appreciate the aircraft’s qualities as it developed into a fine flying machine. 'After the noise of orthodox 'planes, they seemed to slide through the air in an uncanny, effortless silence,' he said. For a short while after the war Gloster's Meteors were the best-performing aircraft in the world and were an export success, being ordered by air forces across the globe. Waterton described it as a ‘wonder plane’. ‘It had the fastest speed and climb, the best manoeuvrability, and the highest ceiling of any production aircraft in the world,’ he said. Today only a handful of Meteors remain in airworthy condition. One is flown as a trials aircraft by British firm Martin Baker, which makes ejection seats for airforces around the world. Another flies in Australia.And two are looked after by the Classic Air Force, at the Newquay museum. Besides its T.7 training machine, the museum formerly known as Air Atlantique when based at Coventry Airport operates a rare NF.11 night fighter which was one of the first vintage jets to be flown in private hands. Classic Air Force, which operates as a charity, is due to open its doors to the public on Good Friday, March 29. It will be the biggest visitor attraction to open in the south west since the Eden Project in 2003. Refuelling Gloster Meteors aircraft at Druffield in Yorkshire. By 1951 there were 20 RAF squadrons flying the Meteor and it became one of the best-loved aircraft in the air force inventory . Boasting 25 aircraft, some of its aeroplanes are regular attractions at airshows across Britain. Some will be available for paying passenger flights. Group Captain Davie Paton OBE RAF retd, the chief executive of the Classic Air Force said: ‘The Meteor is one of the most iconic of all British aircraft and paved the way for generations of jet fighters. Here at the Classic Air Force we operate the last flyable example of the Meteor Night Fighter as well as a two-seat T.7 trainer variant. The aeroplane was built in 1949, making it the oldest flyable British jet in the world.’ Tim Skeet, chairman of the Classic Aircraft Trust, explains the charity was set up in 2012 to ensure the continued operation of the Meteors and several other classic British aircraft in the skies over the UK. He said: ‘Keeping Meteors and other survivors of this era flying is our key objective. It is vital that these aircraft are not lost overseas and can be an inspiration to future generations of pilots and engineers. They really are the last link to an era when Britain ruled the skies.’","4,000 Meteors were built and exported to serve with countries around world .

"A spectacular automotive homage to Stonehenge was today put up for sale for a staggering $300,000 (£185,000).

They . are looking for an entrepreneur to pay $300,000 (£185,000) for the . ten-acre plot with the intention of maximising Carhenge's potential. All the vehicles have been spray-painted grey to give off the impression they are made of stone. Some of the cars are held upright in pits 5ft-deep, while the vehicles which form arches have been welded in place. The layout exactly mirrors how Stonehenge looks today, with pillars fallen down, and not as the original stone circle was laid out between 2500 and 2000BC. The .

"These are the shocking final moments before a 27-year-old camera assistant was killed by a freight train on the set of the biographical film 'Midnight Rider'. The footage, captured on a camera mounted inside the CSX locomotive, shows Sarah Jones and other crew members trying to flee from the railroad bridge they were filming at in southeast Georgia . But while they and stars, including William Hurt and Wyatt Russell, were running for their lives, the metal bed that was being used as a prop in the movie was still lying across the track. Seconds later, the bed was struck by the train, killing Miss Jones, who was in her first day of shooting on the film about the Allman Brothers Band singer, Gregg Allman. Six other workers were injured. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Moments before impact: A camera mounted inside a CSX locomotive shows the final moments before camera assistant Sarah Jones, 27, was killed by a freight train on the set of the biographical film 'Midnight Rider' Fleeing: The shocking footage hows Sarah Jones and other crew members trying to flee from the railroad bridge they were filming at in southeast Georgia. Far right, actors William Hurt and Wyatt Russell flee . 'A deadly weapon': But while those involved in the movie were running for their lives, the metal bed (pictured in white) that was being used as a prop in the movie was still lying across the track. It was hit by the train . The video was unveiled by ABC's 20/20 on Friday, more than eight months after the crash on the bridge spanning the Altamaha River, where filmmakers were allegedly shooting without permission. The footage includes a breakdown of the train's position at various points leading up to the incident. At 26 seconds before impact, the vehicle needed a mile to stop and the engineer blew the whistle loudly. Twenty-three seconds later, Hurt, Russell and two crew members were spotted running along the 30-foot high trestle toward the train in a bid to make it to safety. Others could be seen holding their hands over their ears to block out the deafening sound, while some were captured desperately clinging on to the sides of the bridge. Three seconds on, the train smashed into the bed, which workers had not been able to move off the track in time, turning it into a 'deadly weapon' that 'pushed' Miss Jones into the vehicle. Speaking to the program, hairstylist Joyce  Gilliard, who suffered an arm injury in the crash, said those involved in the shoot had been told that if a train comes, 'you have 60 seconds to get off the track'. Fatal: This still - captured by the train's camera- shows the train about to smash into the bed, which workers had not been able to move off the track in time. The bed then hit Miss Jones, 'pushing' her into the train . Fast-paced: The train continues to speed across the track, while Miss Jones, who was in her first day of shooting of the film about the Allman Brothers Band's Gregg Allman, dies. Six other workers were injured . Talented camera assistant: Miss Jones was just 27 years old when she was struck by the train and killed . Referring to Miss Jones's death on February 20, she added: 'At first it was like a quiet, like people were in shock at what happened. I remember hearing somebody say ""Oh my gosh, she's dead"".' Following the fatal crash, Miss Jones's parents, Richard and Elizabeth Jones, from Columbia, South Carolina,  launched a lawsuit against director Randall Miller and others involved in the film. After carrying out a number of inquiries, investigators determined the filmmakers went onto the railroad bridge  to shoot the footage after CSX Transportation denied them permission. A letter to location manager Charley Baxter, broadcast in the 30-minute program, seemingly confirms officials' findings, reading: 'Unfortunately CSX is not able to support your request.' Last job: During the 20/20 report, photos of Miss Jones's final hours as a camera assistant were also unveiled, including one of her working beside Hurt (pictured), who was lying on the bed on the train tracks . Filming: The bed was being used in a dream sequence that involved Allman lying down and seeing his late brother across the bridge. Above Miss Jones (pictured in green) is seen with actors involved in the film . At the scene: Miss Jones is pictured with hairstylist Joyce Gilliard, who suffered an arm injury in the crash . Meanwhile, Miller is reportedly captured saying ""that's not my job"" when asked questions on why he didn't know that there could be a train barreling down on his crew. The Jones's attorney, Jeff Harris, said: 'You don't shoot on a railroad track unless you have permission to be there.' Miss Gilliard, who is also suing Miller and others involved in the shooting added: 'They wanted to get the shot, so whatever it took to get the shot is what they did. 'The entire crew was put in a situation where we all had to basically run for our lives.' Dedicated: During her career, Miss Jones also worked on the set of The Vampire Diaries, where she was described as a 'cosmic sister' by actor Ian Somerhalder. Above, she is pictured with a film camera . A smiling Sarah Jones: After carrying out a number of inquiries, investigators determined the filmmakers went onto the railroad bridge to shoot the footage after CSX Transportation denied them permission . Scene: Attorney Jeff Harris, said: 'You don't shoot on a rail track unless you have permission to be ther' On Thursday, Mr Harris said the Joneses have decided to dismiss all claims against Allman - an executive producer of the film based on his life story - after reviewing evidence in the case. 'It is clear that Mr. Allman ... had no involvement in any of the decisions that resulted in Sarah's death,' he said in a statement. Allman - who was dismissed alongside two others - was among 10 individuals and eight corporations named as defendants in May when the Joneses filed their lawsuit in Savannah. The couple is still seeking damages from others, including  Miller, railroad firm CSX Transportation and Rayonier Performance Fibers, which owns the property surrounding the crash site. Fighting back tears: Speaking to the program, a tearful Miss Gilliard (pictured) said those involved in the deadly shoot had been assembled and told: 'You have 60 seconds to get off the track' Denied request: A letter to the film's location manager Charley Baxter, broadcast in the  program, reads: 'Unfortunately CSX is not able to support your request' - relating to their request to shoot on the bridge . Miller and three other filmmakers have also been indicted on criminal charges of involuntary manslaughter, a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison, and trespassing in rural Wayne County where the crash occurred. Allman's attorney, David Long-Daniels, said the singer had little involvement with the movie other than licensing the rights to his memoir, 'My Cross to Bear', to the filmmakers. 'We're delighted the Jones family has dismissed us,' Long-Daniels said. 'We remain very sorrowful for the tragedy they have endured with the loss of their daughter.' The Jones family's attorneys said they also dropped claims against Michael Lehman, an executive producer on the film, and Open Road Films, a film distribution and marketing company. Charged: Earlier this year, a jury returned charges of involuntary manslaughter and criminal trespass against Midnight Rider director Randall Miller(left) as well as his wife and business partner, Jody Savin (right) During the 20/20 report, photos of Miss Jones's final hours as a camera assistant were also unveiled, including one of her working beside Hurt, who was lying on the bed on the train tracks. The bed was being used in a dream sequence that involved Allman lying down and seeing his late brother across the bridge, according to The Hollywood Reporter. It also aired a 911 call from the set following the fatal train crash, in which someone is heard requesting an ambulance, saying 'someone got hit by a train'. During her career, Miss Jones also worked on the set of The Vampire Diaries, where she was described as a 'cosmic sister' by actor Ian Somerhalder. Parents: Following the fatal crash, Miss Jones's parents, Richard and Elizabeth Jones (pictured), from Columbia, South Carolina, launched a lawsuit against director Randall Miller and others involved in the film . A beloved daughter: On Thursday, it emerged the Joneses have decided to dismiss all claims against Allman (right) - an executive producer of the film - after reviewing evidence in the case. Left, Miss Jones . On Friday, Miller and producer Jody Savin's attorney told ABC that the filmmakers believed they had permission to be on the tracks from Rayonier. They added: 'They had no reason to believe that anyone would be placed in danger. They will live with the sorrow of Sarah's death for the rest of their lives.' The attorney's comments followed an earlier prepared statement from Miller and Savin in which they said the crash and Miss Jones's death 'will haunt us forever'.. A railroad safety expert also pointed out that the crew had no way of knowing when a freight train might speed down the track because there is no train schedule 'like a major airline might publish'. Production on 'Midnight Rider' was halted after the crash. The case is ongoing.","Sarah Jones killed by freight train while working on set of 'Midnight Rider'

"Tell-all: Bristol Palin's memoir comes out this week . Bristol Palin finished third in ABC's 'Dancing With the Stars', but she hasn't finished trying to claw her way to the top. The 20-year-old daughter of former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin takes several shots at rival conservative daughter Meghan McCain, 26, her mother Cindy McCain and other frenemies in her new memoir. 'Not Afraid of Life: My Journey So Far', co-written with Nancy French, is due out this week from William Morrow, but ABC News today revealed details of what's in the tell-all book. According to ABC, Ms Palin writes that the first time she met Meghan McCain, the young woman 'ignored us during the entire visit'. This was just before Arizona Senator John McCain had officially recognized Sarah Palin as his running mate for vice president, but Ms Palin wrote that she 'had a sneaking suspicion I might need to watch my back. 'Every time we saw Meghan, she seemed to be constantly checking us out, comparing my family to hers and complaining. Oh the complaining'. In the years since 2008, Ms McCain has fostered her own time in the limelight, appearing frequently as a young conservative pundit in media, blogging for The Daily Beast and constantly updating her 112,000 Twitter followers. On June 17, the firebrand tweeted: '""Hi, I'm Meghan McCain"" is in no way, shape or form a pickup line. Trust me honey, you'd know it if I was hitting on you'. About the troubled ex-representative, she Tweeted: 'I am more curious to hear what the creators of Twitter think of Anthony . Weiner resigning than any political pundits this morning...' In her book, Ms Palin wrote about Cindy McCain, heiress to a beer fortune and second wife of the senator: 'I'd never seen people with so much Louis Vuitton luggage, so many cell phones, and so many constant helpers to do hair and makeup'. Rival: Ms Palin writes that fellow conservative pundit Meghan McCain, daughter of politician John McCain, was unfriendly, 'checking us out', 'comparing my family to hers' and 'complaining'. 'Oh the complaining' Primping and cell phones: Ms Palin claims Cindy McCain styles herself a 'queen', with 'helpers', expensive luggage and 'many cell phones' Second wife: Cindy McCain's considerable wealth and connections helped her husband chase his political goals. Ms Palin writes that Mrs McCain offered to be a godmother to her son Tripp as soon as they met . Campaigning: Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) and his wife Cindy McCain at a rally in Nevada November 3, 2008 . Ms Palin wrote of Meghan McCain: 'Every time we saw Meghan, she seemed to . be constantly checking us out, comparing my family to hers and . complaining. Oh the complaining'. On Cindy McCain: 'I'd never seen people with so much . Louis Vuitton luggage, so many cell phones, and so many constant helpers . to do hair and makeup'. On Levi Johnston: He's a 'gnat' who 'cheated on me about . as frequently as he sharpened his hockey skates'. She wrote that Mrs McCain, almost eighteen years her husband's junior, looked 'like a queen' and 'held herself like royalty'. In fact, Mrs McCain's considerable wealth and personal connections had helped her husband's political career immensely, and the fact that he left his first wife of fourteen years to be with her seemed not to slow his popularity down among social conservatives. Ms Palin wrote that she was mystified when Mrs McCain offered to be a godmother to her unborn baby Tripp: 'I had just met her and I wondered why she wanted any type of guardianship over my child'. According to ABC, Ms Palin seems to have saved her deepest jabs for former fiancée Levi Johnston, who has his own tell-all book scheduled for release this fall. She refers to her baby's daddy as a 'gnat' who 'cheated on me about . as frequently as he sharpened his hockey skates'. She writes that while . her parents allegedly 'accepted' her pregnancy, he wasn't so supportive, saying the . child 'Better be a f**king boy'. Ms . Palin claims that Mr Johnston plied her with wine coolers before taking . her virginity, then promised it wouldn't happen again until they were . married. That apparently didn't go as planned, as she would become pregnant with his child shortly after. Later, . she claims he admitted to seeing another woman while he was staying at . the Palin home with her, and eventually, that he had gotten another . women pregnant. 'Gnat': Ms Palin describes former fiancee and baby's daddy Levi Johnston as a 'gnat' who 'cheated on me about as frequently as he sharpened his hockey skates' Star: Bristol Palin competed on 'Dancing With the Stars', and can now add 'author' to her list of credentials . Ms Palin also wrote about her pride and excitement in her mother's campaign, and her maternal instincts for her son Tripp, even going so far as to claim she had felt motivated to adopt a child after the Haiti earthquake. According to ABC, the 20-year-old did not mention that she has earned hundreds of thousands of dollars speaking to Christian groups about abstinence. It's a strange message to send to young people: go ahead and get pregnant out of wedlock as a teenager, and you can get rich and appear on TV in a glamorous dress. And about 'Dancing With the Stars?' Ms Palin wrote that her failed fellow contestants treated her with cold stares. It's hard to say which is more cut-throat, reality TV or politics. Bristol Palin inhabits both worlds.

"The surprise winner of a Texas election has been criticized for misleading the mainly black constituents into believing he was African American. Dave Wilson, a white Republican and anti-gay activist, beat Houston's 24-year incumbent Bruce Austin in what has been described as a 'racially tinged campaign'. Mr Wilson won with a margin of 26 after he campaigned using flyers featuring African Americans and the message 'Vote for our neighbor Dave Wilson'. Campaign: Republican Dave Wilson was the surprise winner of a Houston election . Misleading? Wilson's opposition in the predominately black constituency claimed the businessman implied he was African American . 'I'd always said it was a long shot. I didn't expect to win,' the former fringe candidate told KHOU. His flyers, designed using pictures he had found on the internet, also claimed he had been endorsed by Ron Wilson for the Houston community college seat. Many in the area could have been led to believe the endorsement was from the former African-American state representative but the small print stated the Ron Wilson in question was the candidate's cousin. 'He's a nice cousin,' Mr Wilson told KHOU as he held back a laugh. 'We played baseball in high school together. And he's endorsed me.' Family ties: Wilson's flyers said he was endorsed by Ron Wilson but the small print revealed this was his cousin and not the former state representative . Political scientists have said it is unlikely that Mr Wilson's flyers would have had much impact on his campaign, but the Democrat he unseated was not impressed. 'I don't think it's good for both democracy and the whole concept of fair play. But that was not his intent, apparently,' Mr Austin said. He tried to counter the campaign by releasing flyers showing Mr Wilson and labeling him a 'right-wing hate-monger'. Mr Austin said he intends to call for a recount but analysts believe Mr Wilson's victory will be upheld, putting him in office for six years. Protest: Bruce Austin, left, who lost his seat to Wilson claims voters were misled by the flyers. One claimed he was endorsed by Ron Wilson, which some may have taken to mean the former state representative, right . Bob Stein, political scientist at Rice University, said however that the community college system covered by the election had come under intense scrutiny for insider deals and overseas spending. He added that after 24 years in office, Mr Austin's name should have been familiar to voters too. 'I suspect it's more than just race. The Houston Community College was under some criticism for bad performance. And others on the board also had very serious challenges,' he said.","Republican 'endorsed' by cousin with same name as respected state representative .

"Concerns: Trevor Philliips said Britain was ¿in denial¿ about growing levels of racial division . Britain is turning into a ‘colour-coded society’ as whites and ethnic minorities choose to live apart, Trevor Phillips warns today. The former head of the equalities watchdog said Britain was ‘in denial’ about growing levels of racial division resulting from the choices different groups make about where to live. Mr Phillips, who is now leading a research project at the think-tank Demos, made his comments as he launched a study into how different ethnic groups have moved around England and Wales. His study found that when whites leave urban areas to have children they tended to settle in overwhelmingly white areas in the countryside. At the same time, members of  ethnic minorities tend to move to areas that are largely populated by other ethnic minority groups. This, the research suggests, is the result of not wanting to be ‘ethnic pioneers’ – the only minority people in white areas. Mr Phillips, the former chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, described this process as ‘comfort zone segregation’ and warned it would ‘set communities against each other’. He said: ‘We’ve been in denial on this issue for far too long. ‘This research reveals that we have yet to face up to the risk  that we are drifting into a colour-coded society. ‘There’s no doubt that today’s Britain is way more at ease with ethnic and cultural difference than the country in which I grew up –nobody moves out of the street because I’ve moved in. But ironically, the next generation’s natural desire to do the right thing for their families is leading to a new kind of social division – what you might call comfort-zone segregation. ‘The consequences are to set communities against each other and to build educational and economic division into our society. ‘If we’re going to halt the trend we first have to acknowledge it is taking place.’ The study, by Demos and Birkbeck, University of London, surveyed the movements of different groups around the country between the censuses in 2001 and 2011. It found 100,000 ethnic minority people left London for other parts of England and Wales, but tended to avoid the 80 per cent of the country that is overwhelmingly white. Instead they mainly moved to ‘mixed’ areas where there are already other established minority groups. Segregated: Members of the Bangladeshi community in Whitechapel east London, the research shows that ethnic minority groups stick to diverse urban areas while the countryside remains overwhelmingly white . White Britons, by contrast, tended to move into mixed areas in London in their 20s, and move out when they start a family. Some 600,000 whites left London for other parts of England and Wales over the same period, with many opting for ‘homogeneous’ areas that are more than 90 per cent white. The report said racial tolerance was not a factor in why people moved out or where they moved  to, nor ethnic differences in wealth or income. Instead, they said it was a result of ‘cultural tastes’ and ideals about what kind of neighbourhood they wanted to live in. Professor Eric Kaufmann of Birkbeck said: ‘The Census shows that  since 2001, white British people have left London and other diverse areas for more homogeneous parts of the country. ‘This is not exactly “white flight” – it seems as though they’re  influenced by friends and family as well as the neighbourhood ideals of their age group. ‘But that doesn’t mean ethnicity isn’t important. ‘Britain’s ethnic minorities haven’t caught the same fever for the countryside as white British over-30s, which seems to be linked to their reluctance to be ethnic pioneers.’","Trevor Phillips former head of the equalities watchdog said Britain was ‘in denial’ about growing levels of racial division .

"David Cameron yesterday rejected John Major’s attack on the ‘shocking’ domination of public life by a private school elite. The Prime Minister insisted he believes ‘what counts is not where you come from but where you are going’. But in his second speech to damage the Government in a month, Sir John told Tory activists he was ‘outraged on behalf of the people abandoned when social mobility is lost’. Sir John's speech comes at a time of deepening unease over the decline in social mobility that had, in the post-war years, let many children from working and lower-middle class backgrounds rise to the top . The former prime minister added: ‘In every single sphere of British influence, the upper echelons of power in 2013 are held overwhelmingly by the privately educated or the affluent middle class. ‘Our education system should help children out of the circumstances in which they were born, not lock them into the circumstances in which they were born. 'We need them to fly as high as their luck, their ability and their sheer hard graft can actually take them. And it isn’t going to happen magically.’ Sir John, who is the son of a circus performer and garden gnome salesman, left school with only three O-levels . Mr Cameron, who went to Eton, is vulnerable to charges that his Cabinet is dominated by a privileged elite. And some wavering Tories believe he should change tack and bring back grammar schools to help poorer children. But Mr Cameron’s spokesman said: ‘At the heart of this is the importance of building what the Prime Minister has described as an aspiration nation. He has said what counts is not where you come from but where you are going. ‘That’s why we have put education reform and welfare reform at the heart of Government policy. The Prime Minister is saying we need to unleash and unlock the promise in everybody. What parents really want to know is that the Government has policies to ensure their kids can fulfil their talents and ambitions.’ Sir John’s speech comes at a time of deepening unease over the decline in social mobility that had, in the post-war years, let many children from working and lower-middle class backgrounds rise to the top. Sir John, who is the son of a circus performer and garden gnome salesman, left school with only three O-levels. On the lack of children from less affluent backgrounds in powerful positions, he said: ‘To me, from my background, I find that truly shocking.’ He blamed the Tony Blair and Gordon Brown Labour governments for leaving a ‘Victorian divide between stagnation and aspiration’. In October, in the wake of Labour leader Ed Miliband’s promise of a freeze on energy prices, Sir John called for a windfall tax on energy companies and spoke of ‘net-curtain poverty’. Tory MP Nadine Dorries said the loss of selective schools was a major factor in denying progress to the underprivileged: ‘I came from a council estate where the way out was to get to a grammar school.’ Sajid Javid, the Tory Financial Secretary to the Treasury and the son of a bus driver, suggested the Government was working to address Sir John’s concerns. ‘The important thing is that this Government continues to put forward its policies on education, on welfare, on the economy,’ he added.","Sir John, who is the son of a circus performer and garden gnome salesman, left school with only three O-levels ."
"People from around the UK seem to have been having eerie premonitions of how the independence referendum will pan out - as maps of the UK with Scotland missing are appearing all over everyday objects. After the ominous vision first appeared in a cloud and then a piece of chicken from KFC, web users reacted by posting jokey pictures of their own 'revelations'. They include photographs of Britain appearing in pieces of bread, puddle and lumps of grilled cheese. Scroll down for video . Butter together: This map of the UK made from bread rolls was created by Bake Off contestant Rob Smart . Wet Britain: Owen Paul posted this 'map of Britain' as a joke after the original stories came to light . But perhaps the most impressive was no accident - it is in fact an edible map of Britain made by a former contestant on The Great British Bake Off. Rob Smart chose to include Scotland on his map - on the grounds, he says, that we are 'Butter Together'. 'I felt the referendum debate on both sides had become a bit heated and there needed to be some light relief,' said Mr Smart, from Hertfordshire. 'I created the shape out of aluminium to create a mould to bake the dough. 'I thought it was appropriate for the last day of the campaigning, because it has been getting quite nasty in the last few days.' Light-hearted: This piece of bread is suspiciously close to the outline of the UK with Scotland missing . Ominous: Ella Harold described this piece of cheese as 'foreboding' when she found it last week . Comparison: Shannon Hudson provided a map to show how much her chicken looked like England . The 57-year-old baking enthusiast appeared on the hit BBC show last year, and made it to the fifth week of the competition. Owen Paul tweeted a picture which he said showed a 'puddle I found in my brother's garden in Glasgow with Scotland missing'. Another Twitter user, Sharon, posted 'left-over paratha shaped like an early map of Britain'. And The Media Blog put up a photograph of a piece of bread, writing: 'Tell the papers! I was making toast when I noticed my bread looks a bit like the UK without Scotland. May be an omen.' Cross-cultural: At an Indian restaurant, a paratha took on an eerily similar aspect . Imprint: This yoghurt lid proved to look like it had a map on the inside . The craze apparently started when a Scottish woman living in England, Gillian Degnan, took a photograph of a cloud which looks like Britain without Scotland. 'I don't know whether it's an omen for the outcome of the Scottish referendum, but I wouldn't be surprised if Scotland vote Yes,' she said. After the story came to light, Englishman Terry O'Neil revealed that he had found a piece of fried chicken which was also shaped like the possible future map of Britain.

"A Moroccan teenager who was forced to marry the man who raped her has been badly injured after he attacked her with a razor. The girl, known only as Khaoula, was attacked after she tried to divorce her husband and was left with 50 'disfiguring' cuts to her face and arms, according to reports. During the attack the girl's husband told her 'I swear that nobody will marry you after me', according to Moroccan news sites. Teenager  left with 50 disfiguring cuts to her face and arms after being attacked by rapist husband she was forced into marrying (pictured, Moroccan protesters demand an end to violence against women) Khaoula is now recovering in hospital, and several organisations have pledged to help her get justice, the International Business Times reports. Until recently, Moroccan law allowed men to escape prosecution for rape if they agreed to marry their victim. Amina Filai, 16, killed herself when she was married to her attacker (pictured, Zohra Filali with a picture of daughter Amina) A judge could recommend marriage rather than jail if the deal was agreed to by the victim and both families - who usually gave consent for fear of losing family honour. The law was repealed in January this year after a huge wave of protests following the death of Amina Filali, 16, who swallowed rat poison and killed herself after being forced to wed her attacker. Amina's father said at the time that the family were pressured into the marriage, with the judge telling them to 'go and make the marriage contract'. Despite Article 475 being repealed - as the law was known - violence against women remains common in the Islamic nation. Campaigners say the new law relies on outdated definitions of rape and violence elsewhere in Moroccan statue, and are asking for the country's entire legal system to be reformed. For example, the severity of punishments can be decided on the basis of whether the victim was a virgin or not before the attack took place. A spokesman for Amnesty said: 'The definition of rape  fails to recognise the reality that rape is committed in different ways including within coercive circumstances which do not necessarily require physical violence, with perpetrators and victims of all genders, and within marriage. 'This flawed, narrow definition still allows rapists to escape accountability.'","Teenager named only as Khaoula is recovering in hospital after attack .

"This is one variety of wine that’s likely to leave you feeling spaced out. Meteorito has been made from cabernet sauvignon grapes and 4.5-billion-year-old meteorite - and represents a blending of two hobbies. The maker is Norwich-born Ian Hutcheon, who runs a vineyard and astronomy centre in Chile called the Centro Astronomica Tagua Tagua. Heavenly: Meteorito wine costs £7 a bottle and is made from a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and space rock . Corking fellow: Astronomer and wine-maker Ian Hutcheon with his unique beverage . The space rock measures three-inches long and was found in the Atacama Desert in Northern Chile, where it is believed to have crashed 6,000 years ago. A private collector from the U.S donated it to Mr Hutcheon, who makes the red wine by putting the meteorite in a wooden barrel with the grapes for 25 days. Mr Hutcheon told MailOnline: ‘The idea behind the project was to blend my passion for both astronomy and enology in a real, physical way rather than just a symbolic one, and give everybody the chance to touch an element of space and taste particles of the birth of the solar system via a very good handcrafted wine. My observatory is just 10 kilometres [six miles] as the condor flies from our Tremonte vineyard.' Meteorito: The wine's label explains how it was made . Crop a load of that: Mr Hutcheon's vineyard in Chile . He added that one hurdle in making the wine was that 'the meteorite addition is quite aggressive'. To combat this it has been filtered carefully 'in order to help it bring out the flavours rather than damage the wine'. Mr Hutcheon says that the wine is ‘livelier’ than the non-meteorite version. It costs £7 a bottle, contains 14.5 per cent alcohol and so far 10,000 litres have been fermented. Space-loving beer enthusiasts are out of luck by the looks of things. However, Japan's Sapporo brewery did rustle up 250 six-packs of Space Barley in 2009. It was made by researchers from the Russian Academy of Sciences, Okayama University and Russian space agency Roscosmos from grains that spent almost half a year in orbit on the International Space Station.

"James Anderson has dismissed Kevin Pietersen's suggestion that the sacked batsman could play for England again in future should there be changes among the ECB hierarchy. Pietersen's England career has looked over ever since he was sacked following the Ashes debacle last winter, and relations have turned even uglier following the batsman's bitter criticism of the national set-up in his recently released autobiography. But the South Africa-born star - the top runscorer in England's history - has suggested he still wants to play international cricket and could do so should Giles Clarke be replaced as chairman of the ECB. Kevin Pietersen has made a series of damaging claims about England in his recent autobiography . Pietersen's England career reached the end of the road after the sad Ashes whitewash last winter . Anderson, however, poured cold water on that idea. 'I can’t really see a way back after what’s been said,' said England's all-time leading wicket-taker, who was a team-mate of Pietersen's throughout the highly successful period under Andy Flower's leadership, which included three Ashes triumphs and lifting the Twenty20 World Cup. Pietersen has felt aggrieved at the way his international career appears to have ended and used his book, KP: The Autobiography, to heavily criticise the ECB, former boss Flower and some of his former team-mates, most notably Matt Prior. 'It’s been an interesting week or so. It’s sad that all the stuff that’s come out has been about a really successful period of cricket,' said Anderson. 'I loved every minute of that. It’s a shame that this overshadows it. 'He was such an amazing player, one of the best, if not the best batsmen we’ve ever had.' Pietersen alleged that there was a 'bullying' culture in the England dressing room, in which the bowlers forced fielders to apologise for mistakes made and players were afraid to stand up for themselves. James Anderson (centre) celebrates a wicket with Pietersen in happier times for England . Prior, Graeme Swann and Stuart Broad were cited as being the ringleaders of a powerful clique in the dressing room, which Pietersen said made for a fractious team atmosphere. Again, however, Anderson gave Pietersen's claims short shrift. 'The dressing room was a really nice play to be,' he said. 'When you’re in a winning successful dressing room, everyone enjoys being there.' 'What I remember of the dominance of those three was that they chose what music went on the ipod.' Jimmy Anderson was speaking ahead of his appearance on The Clare Balding Show which airs Thursday 16th October at 10:15pm on BT Sport 1.","Kevin Pietersen has claimed he could play for England again one day .

"Bad job: Dr Bijan Saha, a GP, caught at the till of his Indian restaurant in Kent . Family doctors are moonlighting at private surgeries while their NHS patients are forced to wait weeks for appointments. An investigation by The Mail on Sunday has found dozens of GPs earning huge sums by taking time out from their NHS jobs to treat private patients. Many are happy to carry out private consultations in the evenings and weekends – even though their profession has strongly resisted Government pressure to open NHS surgeries at these times. While patients who can pay up to £100 for a private appointment can be seen within hours, NHS patients must wait for up to three weeks. The doctors are not breaking any rules, but critics say their absence from NHS surgeries for many hours every week is severely limiting the time available for appointments. The revelations come after figures from the Royal College of GPs showed that one in six of all consultations last year – some 47 million appointments –involved a wait of at least a week to see a doctor or nurse. A snapshot survey by this newspaper has found: . Last night, critics condemned the arrangements. Katherine Murphy, of the Patients’ Association, said: ‘You would expect their first duty of care to be with their patients. It’s interesting that GPs can pick and choose where and when they work, but patients don’t have that luxury.’ Even other doctors echoed the criticism. Dr Richard Willis, who left the NHS to run a private practice in Salisbury, Wiltshire, said: ‘I would certainly feel very uncomfortable if I looked after a mix of NHS and private patients and NHS patients had to wait significantly longer to be seen than patients who were able to pay.’ Our investigation has uncovered at least 50 GPs who spend several hours a week with paying customers. Their NHS patients often have to wait days for appointments after struggling to get through on the phone. By contrast, receptionists in private surgeries answer straight away and can offer appointments at just a few hours’ notice. Curry on doctor: Dr Saha's eaterie, Darjeeling Heights, in Rainham, Kent . A doctor whose surgery has been condemned by patients and watchdogs moonlights at a curry house. On Friday, Dr Bijan Saha was seen by  The Mail on Sunday dealing with takeaway orders at the Darjeeling Heights restaurant in Rainham, Kent, run by his wife Chhaya. The 73-year-old took his post behind the counter soon after 8pm, after his NHS surgery closed for the weekend. Patients have slammed the service provided at Lakeside Medical Practice in Sittingbourne, where he is the only GP. One online review on NHS Choices warned: ‘Avoid it like the plague.’ Another stated: ‘This is a terrible surgery. The staff are rude and never answer the phone.’ Their concerns have been backed up  by England’s health watchdog, the Care Quality Commission, which recently declared his practice did not meet any of 11 key standards and was placing patients at ‘unacceptable risk’. Dr Saha, who has decided to retire at the end of the month, declined to comment. Dr Mark Bonar splits his time between an NHS surgery and at his Ultra Wellness Clinic in Harley Street, which charges £150 for a 15-minute appointment. He said he was ‘forced’ into the private work after his  NHS hours were reduced because of financial cuts. Most GPs in England are partners, which means they also run the business side of their practices. Average earnings are £103,000. Increasing numbers of England’s 35,000 family doctors are ‘salaried’, meaning they are paid by partners to work a set number of hours. Out of hours: The doctor, who has decided to retire at the end of this month, began his shift at 8pm, just after his surgery closed for the weekend . Their average earnings are lower at £56,800 but their contracts leave them free to moonlight in the private sector, where pay is much higher. Dr Victoria Blackburn works weekdays in a NHS clinic in Stonehouse, Gloucestershire, where some patients have to wait three weeks to be seen. But on Saturdays she works at the private Nuffield Health-run Cheltenham Hospital – which charges £95 for a consultation. She said: ‘I am contracted to work seven sessions a week (35 hours) within the NHS. I frequently exceed these hours. I choose to spend my “spare” hours doing work including one session a week at Nuffield Health.’ Court out: Dr Allen attends to Sergiy Stakhovsky at Wimbledon in 2011, after he was hit by the serve of Jamie Murray . Patients of Dr Jane Allen will have to wait until next month as to see her – as she’s taking time off from Wimbledon Village Surgery to become the official ‘club doctor’ of the tennis tournament  on the clinic’s doorstep. Dr Allen, 61, said she couldn’t comment on her ‘high-profile job’, adding: ‘It’s nobody’s business. I don’t think my patients are affected at all. Anyway, you have no idea whether I’m on annual leave or working part time.’ Anonymous patients on the NHS Choices website, above, have slated her surgery for the ‘frustrating experience’ of booking an appointment. Dr Bish Naha and Dr Naem Khan, who work at South London’s  Mitcham Medical Centre – rated as ‘absymal’ on the NHS Choices patients’ review website – also ply their trade at Wimbledon Private GP Clinic, which offers a 24-hour call-out service and charges £90 for a consultation. Dr Naha said he had an NHS contract to work a set number of hours, but outside that he can take on other work. He added: ‘I wish I had funding for a weekend service for our NHS patients. We used to do so on Saturday mornings but funding was withdrawn.’ Three GPs who work  in the NHS also do shifts at the  Platinum Medical Centre, attached to the upmarket Wellington Hospital in St John’s Wood, North London. One of them, Dr Selwyn Dexter, runs the North West London Medical Centre which has received a poor review from the Care Quality Commission watchdog. NHS GP Mark Bonar charges his private patients £150 for a 15-minute appointment at the Ultra Wellness Clinic in  Harley Street. But at the Connaught Square NHS Practice where he works, in Central London, waiting times can be up to three weeks, say patients on NHS Choices website. Dr Bonar says he works 24 hours a week there, plus occasional weekends, and 20 hours a week privately. He says he only sees a ‘handful’ of patients in private practice, adding:  ‘Patients at my NHS practice can always be seen the same day if it is urgent. Routine patients can sometimes have a wait, especially to see me personally, but this is not dissimilar to very many NHS practices. Dr Claire Winstanley, a part-time NHS GP in Bristol who also sees paying patients at The Chesterfield private hospital, said doctors were turning to ad hoc private work because of the Government’s ‘unsettling’ overhaul of GP services. She said: ‘ I don’t think doctors are skiving off to see private patients, but working extra hard in their spare time. Doctors would not put money before patients – but they still need an income.’ Although hospital consultants can also treat their NHS patients privately, and many do, GPs are not allowed to offer paid treatment to their NHS patients. Dr Chaand Nagpaul of the British Medical Association, the doctors’ union, said there was little demand for private GP services in England. Many patients seen privately are thought to be from overseas and ineligible for free NHS care. Health Minister Dr Dan Poulter blamed the former Labour government for ‘botching’ the 2004 GP contract, saying: ‘It vandalised the relationship between patients and doctors as it allowed GPs to opt out of providing out-of-hours services. ‘Now we pay a premium to get GPs to do what they once did for free. What we want is to see GPs providing extended opening hours and extra appointments.’ Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said the Coalition must take responsibility as ‘patients will find these revelations hard to stomach’. We know from our helpline, where we hear from patients on a daily basis about the issues they have trying to see their GP, that it’s almost impossible to get a same-day appointment, which results in many patients having to go to A&E. Some patients tell us they have to wait four days and they face the frustration of having to ring the surgery every morning to see if there is an appointment. No one knows when they’re  going to need to see a GP, so the services in primary care should  be available to the public when  the public needs them. Shocked: Chief executive of the Patients Association Katherine Murphy says she receives hoards of complaints about waits of up to four days for appointments . Patients should have access to GP services 24/7 and the GP should be the first point of contact for anyone who requires healthcare. It’s a vicious circle for patients – because of GPs’ non-availability at certain times, they’re not able to access the service. It’s the responsibility of the commissioner that a safe service  is accessible and available to patients when they need it. The vast majority of patients wouldn’t be able to exercise the choice of seeing their GP privately because they can’t afford to, and why should they have to pay to see their GP? They’re already paying for a health service that should be available when they need it. Ultimately, the accountability lies with the NHS commissioners. They should make sure that there is a service in the community, and that if GPs have available time it should be used seeing NHS patients. There is no continuity of care  out of hours, and this is the danger to patients when the service isn’t provided by their GP but by private contractors. This is because they have very little knowledge of local services and the history of the patient, which is obviously important if they have got long-term conditions. We’ve been told by the Royal College of GPs that many GPs are retiring over the next couple of years. If we’re going to get the  NHS patient-centred, it is really important that the appropriate services are available to the public in the community, so that we stop people from turning up at A&E because it’s the only place with  the light always on.","Investigation has found dozen of MPs earn huge sums outside their practice .

"An Australian girl who was kidnapped, beaten and married off to her older cousin by her father’s family in Syria at the age of 13 has spoken out about her horrific five-year ordeal for the first time. Rania Farrah was on what was meant to be a trip of a lifetime to Egypt to visit the pyramids with her older brother but instead ended up being turned into a child bride by her own family. Appearing on Channel Nine’s 60 Minutes on Sunday night, Ms Farrah revealed she planned to commit suicide if her escape plan on her 18th birthday didn't work, and said: ‘I was just in a depression the whole time I was there… I just thought of Australia.’ Scroll down for video . Kidnapped: Australian Rania Farrah was 13 when she was abducted by her father's family and taken to Syria from Egypt . Ms Farrah, who grew up living in Sydney’s southwest and is the daughter of a Syrian Muslim and his Australian convert wife, was married off to her cousin who she had never met and endured terrible beatings after being taken to Syria’s capital Damascus from Egypt. Her mother, who had previously fled Ms Farrah's father after 20 years of violent marriage, knew about her daughter's kidnapping but told her during phone calls from that she could not afford to bring her home to Australia. On arrival in Damascus, Ms Farrah was subjected to a virginity test because her father decided she had been under bad influences when in Year 7 at school, when she started smoking cigarettes and talking to boys. 'They wanted to check for my virginity. They said to enroll in a school they needed to check I was a virgin,’ Ms Farrah explained. Tearful: Ms Farrah was emotional as she retold her horrifying ordeal on Channel Nine's 60 Minute show on Sunday night . Trapped: Ms Farrah, seen here at 13, had travelled to Egypt on what was meant to be a trip of a lifetime to visit the pyramids with her older brother but ended up being turned into a child bride . She felt 'confusion and fear' as nurses came and held her down. After the virginity test - despite the results showing she was indeed a virgin - her father and brother beat her at her Auntie’s house. 'It’s quite a normal thing to kill your daughter for not being a virgin,' she noted. On Sunday, Ms Farrah described her father as ‘an evil person, he’s the most evil person you’ll ever meet’. Opening up to Liz Hayes about the shocking crime of forced marriage that affects hundreds of Australian women every year, she explained that she shut off her emotions and played along with her family’s plan while dreaming of her escape. Living in a strict Muslim world, she attended an Islamic school and learned Arabic. 'I did all the things they asked me to do… I was taught how to pray and fast for Ramadan,' she said. Reenactment: The 60 Minute show illustrated how Ms Farrah escaped Syria on her 18th birthday. She was driven to safety in Jordan by British Embassy officials before boarding a flight to Sydney . Ms Farrah was taken from Egypt (bottm left) to Syria's capital Damascus . Her second cousin, who she was forced to marry, was in his early thirties and Ms Farrah avoided ‘eye contact’ and never spoke to him. ‘We had the engagement party, I got given the gold… I put on the face. But I didn’t feel anything because by that stage I was already planning my escape.’ Ms Farrah hatched an escape plan to return to Australia on her 18th birthday and was helped by the British Embassy to return to Sydney. A neighbour, who was around the same age as Ms Farrah, had passed her the phone number for the embassy. But she had to wait until she was 18 before officials were legally allowed to help her. When she was legally an adult, they told her a woman would wait for her at the Four Seasons hotel in Damascus. Ms Farrah crept out her house and jumped into a taxi while her grandmother was asleep after morning prayer. Back home: Miss Farah is now a university student with dreams of working in business. She has taken out a restraining order on her father who has also returned to Sydney . Feeling trapped and desperate, she said: ‘If I didn’t get out I was going to kill myself that day.’ Luckily an official was waiting for her at the hotel and gave her a ‘big hug’. They then travelled to the Jordanian border with two body guards and after a tense conversation with Syrian border patrol, Ms Farrah was on her way to freedom and back to Australia. ‘It was early morning when we arrived and we flew over Sydney Harbour,’ Ms Farrah recalled tearfully of arriving back in her homeland. She said her mother and family in Australia has never asked about her time in Syria or asked how she was feels to be home. And although she is out of Syria, she is still terrified her father will track her down and has taken out a restraining order against him. Unfortunately Ms Farrah’s story is not as rare as it might seem. The Immigrant Women’s Health Service in Fairfield, in Sydney’s west, has rescued 62 child brides from Iraqi, Afghani, Pakistani, Indian, Egyptian, Turkish and Sudanese families over the past three years.","Australian Rania Farrah was taken against her will to Syria while on holiday with her older brother in Egypt .

"A former New York City transit cop shot and killed his wife in front of their two young children Saturday morning in their home, say police. Kevin Canty, 43, was taken into custody about a mile from his Queens home, where earlier his 40-year-old wife, who has not been named, was shot in the upper body. The couple's two young children, a girl aged four and a boy aged eight, were home at the time of the shooting. Apprehended: Kevin Canty was taken into custody for shooting his wife dead in their Queens home . According to CBS, a neighbor shopping at a nearby deli saw the two children run from the house, yelling, 'Daddy shot Mommy!' 'They came in screaming, crying saying their dad just shot their mom and there’s blood all over, please help,' local Heidi Gamble said. First responders to the scene at 104th Street near 101st Avenue in Ozone Park found the woman with gunshot wounds to her torso. A neighbor told the New York Post he was in the bathroom when he heard the woman’s screams. 'I heard a woman yelling, saying ""No, no, no!""' he said. 'It sounded like it was on TV.' She was rushed to Jamaica Hospital Medical Center in cardiac arrest and died a short time later. Witnesses told CBS that Canty ran several blocks away and allegedly tried to steal a car. He was arrested at Pitkin Avenue. Canty worked as a Manhattan transit cop before he retired last year with a disability. Quiet street: The shooting occurred on Saturday morning inside a home on 104th Street near 101st Avenue in Ozone Park . He received praise on the NYPD Facebook page for his part in saving a man who had a heart attack at Union Square subway station in 2012. A neighbor told the New York Post that Canty was 'scary and intimidating.' 'He doesn’t really talk to people too much. You have to talk to him first,' Daniel Ali, 30, said. Another neighbor said she wasn't surprised by the violent turn of events. 'They were not a happy couple,' Joanne Bagley, 52, told the Post. 'They fight all the time on the block. I guess it was inevitable.' The two children are now in protective custody.","A 40-year-old woman was shot dead Saturday morning in her Queens home .

"Critic: Gay rights campaigner Alice Nkom (above) says homosexuals in Cameroon are often tortured by police to induce confessions . Ten women have been arrested in Cameroon on suspicion of being lesbians. They have been detained in Ambam, some 190 miles south of the capital of Yaounde, until they go on trial, Cameroon Radio Television reported. Consensual same-gender sex is considered criminal in the West African nation and punishable by a jail sentence from six months to five years and a fine. Gay rights defender and founder of the Association for the Defence of Homosexuals, Alice Nkom, says detainees in Cameroon are frequently tortured in police stations to force them confess. It comes as another African country, Liberia, prepares to consider a bill to strengthen its own existing anti-gay laws. Liberia's former first lady, Senator Jewel Taylor, submitted a bill last week that would prohibit same-sex marriage and make homosexuality a first-degree felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison. She said: 'We are only strengthening the existing law. Some media are reporting that I said anyone found guilty of involvement in same sex should face the death penalty. 'I did not say so. I am calling for a law that will make it a first degree felony,' she said. The current law considers gay relationships a first-degree misdemeanour, which carries a punishment of up to a year in prison. 'We are looking at it critically' and will put it before the entire Senate 'during our next sitting on Thursday', Senator Joseph Nagbe, chair of the Judicial Committee, said. Outlawed: Same-gender sex can be punishable by up to five years in prison in Cameroon . If passed by the Senate, the strengthened bill would then go the House and then the president. Liberia's president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, a recent Nobel Peace Prize winner, has said she will not sign any such bill into law. 'Liberia is a member of the global community and therefore cannot kick against the rights of others to do what they choose to do,' said Archie Ponpon, chairman of the newly-formed gay rights advocacy group the Movement for the Defence of Gays and Lesbians in Liberia. Mr Ponpon and his family have already faced hostility because of his fight for gay rights in Liberia. Weeks ago, his mother's house was set on fire and he and another advocate, Abraham Kamara, were mobbed by angry students while campaigning at the University of Liberia. 'We will not relent,' he said. 'People will come to the realisation that in this day and age, individuals should be free to practice what they wish.' A wave of intense homophobia has been washing across Africa in the past few years, where homosexuality is already illegal in many countries. 'It's getting worse,' Cameroon gay rights defender Ms Nkom said of homophobia. 'People accused of homosexuality are put in jail straight away,' she told reporters in November after three men were each sentenced to five years in prison for homosexual acts. Earlier this month, Uganda re-introduced a bill that would make the death sentence mandatory for gays who are 'repeat offenders'. U.S. President Barack Obama denounced the bill as 'odious', while Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called on Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni to reject it and some international donors threatened to cut aid if it became law.","Face up to five years in prison if convicted .

"Holland’s new king Willem-Alexander today declared the end of the welfare state in a nationally-televised annual address. The king, who is at 46 the youngest monarch in Europe, said a new 'participation society' would take its place, in which people must save and invest to create their own social safety net with less help from the national government. 'The shift to a ""participation society"" is especially visible in social security and long-term care,' the king said in a speech to MPs written for him by Prime Minister Mark Rutte’s government. King Willem-Alexander, seen with his wife Queen Maxima and daughters Princess Catharina Amalia, Princess Ariane and Princess Alexia of the Netherlands, declared the welfare state dead today . 'The classic welfare state of the second half of the 20th century in these areas in particular brought forth arrangements that are unsustainable in their current form.' He said that nowadays, people expect and 'want to make their own choices, to arrange their own lives, and take care of each other.' Rutte may provide details on what the shift to a 'participation society' will entail, but it appears to be part of a long-term effort to rein in costs. Benefits such as unemployment compensation and subsidies on healthcare have been regularly pruned for the past decade. The king travelled past waving fans in an ornate horse-drawn carriage to the 13th-century Hall of Knights in The Hague for the monarch’s traditional annual address on the day the government presents its budget for the coming year. It was Willem-Alexander’s first appearance on the national stage since former Queen Beatrix abdicated in April and he ascended to the throne. Rutte may be hoping that the pomp and ceremony surrounding the king will provide a diversion from the gloomy reality of new cuts. The Dutch king was reading a speech written for him by Prime Minister Mark Rutte's (pictured) government . Though specifics are not yet available, a review of the government’s plans by the country’s independent analysis agency Monday showed that the budget deficit will widen in 2014 to 3.3 percent of GDP despite new spending cuts intended to reduce it. Eurozone rules specify that countries must keep their deficit below 3 percent, and Rutte has been among the most prominent of European leaders, along with Germany’s Angela Merkel, in insisting that Southern European countries attempt to meet that target. After several consecutive years of government spending cuts, the Dutch economy is expected to have shrunk by more than 1 percent in 2013, and the agency is forecasting growth of less than 0.5 percent next year. 'The necessary reforms take time and demand perseverance,' the king said. But they will 'lay the basis for creating jobs and restoring confidence.' A series of recent polls have shown that confidence in Rutte’s government is at record low levels, and that most Dutch people - along with trade unions, employers’ associations and many economists - believe the Cabinet’s austerity policies are at least partially to blame as the Dutch economy has worsened even as recoveries are underway in neighbouring Germany, France and Britain. Dutch media are also expecting new defence spending cuts, following a 2011 decision to cut 12,000 jobs - one out of every six workers in the military - between 2012 and 2015. However, the government is expected to say it has decided once and for all not to abandon the U.S.-led 'Joint Strike Fighter' program to develop new military aircraft. The program has suffered cost overruns and created divisions within Rutte’s governing coalition. The debate in parliament that follows the presentation of the budget will be crucial for the future of the coalition, as it does not command a majority in the upper house, and it must seek help from opposition parties to have the budget approved.","King Willem-Alexander said it was time for a new 'participation society' in which people save money for their own safety nets .

"It could give your fish a new lease of life - and allow them to explore the world outside their aquarium. A team of Dutch researchers has developed a remote control aquarium on wheels that fish can steer themselves. The bizarre gadget is set to be launched as a Kickstarter project. Scroll down for Video . The robo-aquarium: The new gadget allows fish to roam free around their home . The prototype version of 'Fish on Wheels' was constructed using a standard webcam, and an Arduino, a tiny comuter, controlled robot vehicle. Using the contrast of the fish with the bottom of the fish tank, its position is determined and used to send commands to the Arduino computer control board to move the car into that direction. It uses a camera to analyse the direction the fish is swimming in - and controls the car accordingly. 'We came up with the idea of developing the 'Fish on Wheels' device . because we wanted to have something to showcase the possibilities of . computer vision technology,' Thomas de Wolf of Dutch firm Studio Diip told MailOnline. 'We then came to the idea that with computer vision even animals would be able to control devices. 'The best way to show this was to enable fish to drive their own aquarium wherever they want to go.' A prototype version of  'Fish on Wheels' was constructed using a standard webcam, a battery powered Beagleboard and an Arduino controlled robot vehicle. Using the contrast of the fish with the bottom of the fish tank, its position is determined and used to send commands to the Arduino computer control board to move the car into that direction. 'Our pet fish have always been limited to their water holding area known as 'the fish tank', the firm said. A camera mounted above the tank allows it to 'watch' the fish to see what direction to drive in . The location of the fish is determined using computer software, which can then 'drive' the car in the direction the fish is swimming in .

"It's an old cartoon stereotype that has long felt outdated, but scientists think they may finally have evidence to justify the claim that women are more afraid of mice than men are. A new . study suggests millions of experiments may have been ruined because rodents are ‘stressed’ by the smell of researchers - . with a man's scent far more distressing than that of a woman. This is likely to mean mice are less concerned about revealing their presence when a woman is around, and are more likely to confront a female than they are a man. A new study claims experiments with laboratory rats, which have been used for centuries, may be worthless because rats and mice are 'stressed' by the smell of researchers, with the scent of man being more distressing than that of a woman. Stock image pictured . The study, conducted by Canadian scientists at McGill University in Montreal, found that a researcher’s gender can have a significant impact on tests of pain. Stress blocks pain, which means that when a male lab technician is the room, a rat or mouse will feel far less pain than when a woman is conducting the experiment. The findings, published in the journal Nature Methods, are significant for any experiment looking at the side effects of drugs or any test involving monitoring pain. Some 95 per cent of all lab animals are mice and rats. Psychology professor Jeffrey Mogil, who conducted the study, said: ‘Scientists whisper to each other at conferences that their rodent research subjects appear to be aware of their presence, and that this might affect the results of experiments, but this has never been directly demonstrated until now.’ The study found that pheromones, which are secreted by men at higher concentrations than women, had a distinct impression on lab rodents. The chemical triggered a stress response in mice and rats equivalent to that caused by restraining the rodents for 15 minutes in a tube or forcing them to swim for three minutes. The study found that pheromones, which are secreted by men at higher concentrations than women, had a distinct impression on lab rodents. The researchers said the effects can be mitigated by staying in the room with the animal before testing, but the gender of the experimenter should be published alongside the research . The study involved placing cotton T-shirts, worn the previous night by male or female experimenters, alongside the mice. The effects were identical to those caused by the presence of the scientists themselves. Study leader Professor Robert Sorge said: ‘Our findings suggest that one major reason for lack of replication of animal studies is the gender of the experimenter - a factor that’s not currently stated in the methods sections of published papers.’ Prof Mogil added: ‘The problem is easily solved by simple changes to experimental procedures. ‘For example, since the effect of males’ presence diminishes over time, the male experimenter can stay in the room with the animals before starting testing. ‘At the very least, published papers should state the gender of the experimenter who performed the behavioural testing.’ Scientists from the University of British Columbia replicated a casino environment by making rats gamble for sugar pellets using a . slot machine-style device. It featured three flashing lights and two . levers they could push with their paws. The rats responded to a series of three flashing lights before choosing between two levers. One combination of lights signaled a win and another combination signaled a loss. A 'cash-out' lever rewarded the rat with . 10 sugar pellets on winning trials, but gave a 10-second 'time out' penalty on losing trials. The 'roll again' lever allowed the rats to begin a new trial without penalty, but provided no sugar pellets. Interestingly, . the rats showed a tendency towards choosing the cash-out lever when . nearly getting the right combination suggesting that rats, like people, . are susceptible to the the 'near-miss effect'. By . blocking the D4 receptors with drugs, the researchers were successfully . able to reduce the rat's choice of the 'cash-out' lever on non-winning . trials.","Laboratory rats have been used in scientific experiments for over a century .

Automatic gear system will even  recognise when car is repeatedly overtaking - and keep it in a lower gear for added acceleration . Sexy looks matched with powerful performance and the refined balance . and poise of a prima ballerina mean that this British-built two-seater . roadster is set to cause a sensation – even though only 7,000 will be . built each year. With James Bond film producers and 007 star Daniel Craig already having a . relationship with Jaguar Land Rover – whose vehicles featured . prominently in their last movie Skyfall - I would not be surprised to . see Britain’s top agent replacing his trashed Aston Martin DB5 with a . Jaguar F-Type in the next big screen outing. And there are other Hollywood A-listers likely to be joining him, I hear. On looks alone the F-Type is a sight to behold thanks to beautiful and . contemporary styling from a team led by design boss Ian Callum. It may . have been dubbed the spiritual successor to the legendary E-Type of the . 1960s, but this 21st century car is definitely not stuck in a time warp. One of the neatest touches are the ‘deployable’ door handles which pop . out when you need to open the door, but return to sit flush with the . door once you are under way. It’s already won the prestigious ‘World Car Design of the Year’ title. But fire up the engine by depressing the ‘start’ button on the dash . board and the noise of it bursting into life will really set your pulse . racing as it roars into life ahead of a truly responsive spirited . drive. As pop group Slade put it: ’Come on feel the noise.’ Built at Jaguar’s Castle Bromwich plant near Birmingham, the new Jaguar . F-Type even has an ‘active exhaust system’ which cunningly channels the . exhaust gases and amplifies the ‘brum, brum’ sound of the revving car . inside the cabin so you can enjoy the ‘blip, crackle and pop’ as you . drive.

"Wallabies star Kurtley Beale was asked to change his shirt during a flight by a female staff member, before an argument led to him being dropped for the side's match against Argentina. The request came from head coach Ewen McKenzie through business manager Di Patston, who also asked the same of rookie second-rower Sam Carter during the team's flight from Johannesburg to Sao Paolo on Sunday, according toFairfax Media. However, what is believed to have sparked the verbal altercation just 15 hours after the side's 28-10 loss to the Springboks, was when Beale is said to have made a sarcastic comment as he returned to his seat. It was reported that Patston questioned the remark, according to witnesses on the plane, which caused the argument as McKenzie and other club members  tried to intervene. Scroll down for video . Wallabies star Kurtley Beale was allegedly involved in a verbal altercation with a female staff member during a flight from Johannesburg to Sao Paolo on Saturday . McKenzie has confirmed that Beale has been left out of the 23-man squad but says the decision was made as a game strategy, for 'team balance' - rather than as disciplinary action after the controversy. Patston returned to Australia on Tuesday of her own accord, from Buenos Aires, two days later. McKenzie missed training on Tuesday afternoon to escort her to the airport but on Wednesday said Beale remained available for selection for Saturday's Rugby Championship clash with the Pumas in Mendoza. Beale's 47-Test career has been dogged by a succession of off-field problems and last year the 25-year-old was forced to undergo counselling and rehabilitation for his struggles with alcohol. McKenzie, though, said the troubled playmaker shouldn't be hung out to dry. 'Obviously we're aware of the history but you deal with every incident as it comes along,' he said. 'And you've got to determine the facts and until we determine that fully, I'm not going to make any more judgment on it.' An ARU spokesperson said they expected the investigation to be completed by the end of next week. It came the day after the Wallabies's 28-10 loss to the Springboks in Cape Town . The Australian Rugby Union's integrity unit investigating an alleged incident . 'The investigation will ensure all parties have an opportunity to present all relevant facts, before any assessment of the alleged incident can be reached,' they said. McKenzie declined to comment on the severity of the allegation or any possible sanctioning, but it's understood the altercation was only verbal. 'We've referred it to the experts,' McKenzie said. 'I mean, obviously there's protocols and things in place.' McKenzie refused to divulge whether alcohol was involved, but the Wallabies have a protocol of no drinking on flights and are only allowed to indulge on the night after a Test match. 'Matters of integrity, you've actually got to protect the people involved until there is some sort of decision,' McKenzie said. Wallabies coach Ewen McKenzie (right) on Wednesday said Beale (left) remained available for selection for Saturday's Rugby Championship clash . Last year the 25-year-old was forced to undergo counselling and rehabilitation for his struggles with alcohol . McKenzie admitted he was aware of the incident soon after it happened, but other dramas - including the delayed arrival of the 42-strong touring party's luggage - had slowed the investigation process. The coach missed Wallabies training in Buenos Aires on Tuesday - their only session so far this week - while dealing with the incident in which he claimed 'there were a number of people involved'. McKenzie conceded the incident was a major distraction ahead of their final Rugby Championship match. 'These things are time-consuming, so I don't pretend that I enjoy the distraction of it,' he said. 'But matters of welfare are critical. Matters of behaviour are critical, too, to team culture. 'So I'm not going to sit here and leave things undone or not attended, so obviously the ARU will take the lead on it but I'll follow it through and make sure things get sorted.'","Wallabies star Kurtley Beale left out of side for clash with Argentina .

"A study found that nut-consumers demonstrated a lower body weight, body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference . Dieters often dismiss them because of their high fat content, but research suggests that snacking on nuts can help keep you slim. A study found that those who consumed varieties such as almonds, cashews and pistachios demonstrated a lower body weight, body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference compared to non-consumers. They were also at lower risk of developing heart disease, type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Experts are now recommending a daily intake of 1.5 ounces, or three tablespoons of nuts as part of a healthy diet. Lead researcher Carol O'Neil, from Louisiana State University, said: 'One of the more interesting . findings was the fact that tree nut consumers had lower body weight, as . well as lower body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference compared to non-consumers. 'The mean weight, BMI, and waist circumference were 4.19 . pounds, 0.9kg/m2 and 0.83 inches lower in consumers than non-consumers, . respectively.' In the study, published in the Journal of . the American College of Nutrition, researchers compared risk factors . for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome of nut . consumers versus those who did not consume nuts. They used data from 13,292 men and women . participating in the 1999-2004 National Health and . Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). Nut consumers were defined as those who ate more than one quarter of an . ounce a day. Tree nut - almonds, Brazil nuts, . cashews, hazelnuts, macadamias, pecans, pine nuts, pistachios and . walnuts - consumption specifically, was associated with higher levels of good cholesterol and lower risk of chronic diseases including heart disease. In addition, it was also linked to a lower prevalence of four risk factors for metabolic syndrome: abdominal obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar levels and low good cholesterol levels. Dr O'Neil adds: 'Tree nuts should be an integral part of a healthy diet and encouraged by health professionals—especially registered dietitians.' Maureen Ternus, executive director of the International Tree Nut Council Nutrition Research & Education Foundation (INC NREF), also congratulated the recent data. She said: 'In light of these new data and the fact that the FDA has issued a qualified health claim for nuts and heart disease with a recommended intake of 1.5 ounces of nuts per day, we need to educate people about the importance of including tree nuts in the diet.'","Nut consumers demonstrate lower BMI and waist circumference .

"The Vatican's answer to George Clooney, Archbishop Georg Ganswein on the cover of Italy's Vanity Fair . It's usually Hollywood stars or models who grace the cover of Vanity Fair but in a break with the tradition the Italian edition of the magazine has come out with a full page portrait of Pope Benedict's private secretary. Archbishop Georg Ganswein, 56, who has been dubbed 'Gorgeous George' by the Italian media has been the pope's righthand man for more than six years and is always at his side. The softly spoken clergyman, who is also a pilot, likes to keep fit by playing tennis, is often pictured in glossy magazines because of his rugged good looks and some have even compared him to actor George Clooney. Archbishop Ganswein has given a handful of interviews but is on the whole a private man - although there was a media frenzy recently after he was snapped late at night walking close to the Vatican with a mystery woman. He was pictured on the cover of the latest issue of Vanity Fair alongside the headline 'Being beautiful is not a sin' adding that he was a 'particular' clergyman, describing him as the ''George Clooney of the Vatican.' Archbishop Ganswein's main role is to organise Pope Benedict's day to day diary and he was recently in the spotlight over the Vatileaks scandal when it emerged he had angered senior Catholic Church figures because of the media's interest in him. However he has insisted his mind is fully on the job and recently said: 'Personally I see my role or service with the Pope as similar to that of glass. The cleaner it is then it will achieve its task. I need let the sunlight and the less you see of the glass then the better it is. If you don't see it at all that means I'm doing my job well.'' Six years fashion designer ago Donatella Versace launched a new rang of designer menswear called ''the clergyman collection'' and admitted it was inspired by the German born Archbishop Ganswein. At the same time an Italian magazine tracked down his first girlfriend and she revealed how they had dated for three years before they split and he then decided to become a priest.

During an interview with Vatican Radio he was asked about his good looks and he said: 'I have never had trouble with the so called fairer sex, I have always had a very serene and natural relationship with women. As a child Archbishop Ganswein was a . promising footballer who idolised Franz Beckenbauer . 'Of course in my youth there were women who I would happily see and there were others I was even happier to see.' He added: 'The Italian newspapers started this off and they wrote very complimentary pieces about me. At first it surprised me and to be honest I also found it irritating. I didn't know what t do - should I say something or should I ignore it. I decided to ignore it and now with time i have got used to it. 'The risk is that by just judging a person superficially you don't really find out what they are like inside.' Childhood . friends have revealed that in his youth Archbishop Ganswein was a . promising footballer who idolised Franz Beckenbauer an he also played . clarinet in a local band. He became a priest in 1984 and spent the first . 12 years preaching in and around Munich - his 'boss' Pope Benedict's . home patch and he has been the Pontiff's secretary for ten years.

"Caroline, Countess of Derby is one of Baron Braybrooke's daughters . Undoubtedly the Earl of Grantham would sympathise with his predicament. An elderly baron with eight daughters and a 6,000-acre estate faces his title being passed to a distant cousin – because he has no sons. The dilemma echoes the plot of ITV series Downton Abbey, where the Earl of Grantham grapples with the problem of having three daughters but no male heir. But in the real-life drama, the case of the 10th Baron Braybrooke has prompted a campaign to change the ancient law that stops daughters from inheriting titles. Peers are asking the Government – which is already legislating so that if the Duke and Duchess  of Cambridge’s firstborn is a girl she can accede the throne – to make an amendment to the rules covering hereditary titles. His eldest daughter, Amanda Murray, scaled down her business as an interior designer to take over the reins at the vast estate. But when her father dies, his title – created in 1788 – will pass to a distant cousin she has never met, because peerages can only go to male heirs. Mrs Murray, 50, said she was aware the predicament of herself and her sisters – who include Caroline, Countess of Derby – might arouse public irritation rather than sympathy, but added: ‘It boils down to this: if I was a boy, I would be sitting pretty. ‘My poor father had no son, just lots of daughters. In this day and age, with supposed equality, why am I not allowed to inherit my father’s title? It is discriminatory. ‘I am managing the estate, including the steam railway, so I am already doing a man’s job.’ It was a similar scenario in the ITV drama when the Earl of Grantham, played by Hugh Bonneville, was horrified to discover that Downton Abbey would pass on his death to distant cousin – and ‘country solicitor’ – Matthew Crawley, played by Dan Stevens. But in the series, the problem was solved when Matthew fell  in love with and married Lady Mary, the eldest of the Earl’s  three daughters. A similar problem also affected Elizabeth Bennett and her four sisters in Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice. They faced being left penniless because, with no male heir, their fortune was due to pass to cousin William Collins, whom none of them wanted to marry. In real life, upon the 10th Baron Braybrooke’s death his title will pass to Richard Neville, a fourth cousin once removed. Mr Neville, 35, is single and owns a flat above a hairdressing salon in South-West London. Mrs Murray said she knew nothing about him, although Mr Neville has said he has met the baron and some of his other daughters, and rode on the Audley End miniature railway in the 1980s. The entrepreneur, who has a stake in events and venue website thehandbook.com, has declined to discuss the baronetcy. Real life dilemma: Baron Braybrooke (pictured centre with his wife, right, and one of his daughters, Amanda Murray second from left) will leave his estate to a distant cousin they barely know . Heir apparent: Richard Neville (pictured with an unknown woman), a fourth cousin once removed, is set to inherit the 6,000-acre estate. He currently lives in a flat above a hairdressing salon in South-West London . But while he will inherit the title, it remains unclear whether he will automatically gain ownership of the estate. Audley End is a 17th century country house and renowned as one of the finest Jacobean houses in England. It was requisitioned during the Second World War and used by the Special Operations Executive, the forerunner of MI6. Mrs Murray said her father had . examined whether the title could skip a generation and pass to her son, . who is 20 – but the law is clear that it may not.

"The Cornish are to be recognised as a national minority group for the first time, it has been revealed. Chief Secretary Danny Alexander announced the decision today, saying it meant for the first time that Cornish people would receive the same rights and protections as other minorities in Britain. It will also mean they are classified under the European Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities the same as the UK's other Celtic people, the Scots, the Welsh and the Irish. Welcome to Cornwall: Campaigners say the region deserves special measures - including economic concessions, such as reductions in fuel duty - in recognition of its geographical location and cultural heritage . Liberal Democrat Cabinet minister Mr Alexander, 41, who is making a visit to Bodmin today, said: ‘Cornish people have a proud history and a distinct identity. ‘I am delighted that we have been able to officially recognise this and afford the Cornish people the same status as other minorities in the UK.’ Campaigners say the region deserves special measures - including economic concessions, such as reductions in fuel duty - in recognition of its geographical location and cultural heritage. Those who have pushed over a 15-year period for Cornwall to be fully recognised under European rules for the protection of national minorities welcomed the announcement. Dick Cole, leader of Cornish independence party Mebyon Kernow, said: ‘This is a fantastic development. ‘A lot of people have been working for many years to get Cornwall the recognition other Celtic people of the UK already receive. The detail is still to come out on what this might mean, but make no mistake that this is a proud day for Cornwall.’ He told MailOnline: ‘The actual . implementation isn't going to cost the Government. There's no immediate . of promise of money from central government. Announcement: Chief Secretary Danny Alexander revealed the decision, saying it meant for the first time that Cornish people would receive the same rights and protections as other minorities in Britain . ‘But in terms of promoting the culture, there's going to be opportunities to access money. It's also the responsibility for the people of Cornwall to make it work us.’ Praise: Prime Minister David Cameron said Cornwall had a 'very special place in my heart' Mr Cole also said that it is not the case that all councils will have to employ Cornish diversity officers, because they all already have equality and diversity strategies which will now cover the Cornish as well. And in terms of road signs in Cornwall, there are at least 1,000 already in place, he said - and they are all being built on new estates to avoid any extra cost of replacing existing signs. In response to claims by critics that the Cornish are no different to any other community in England, Mr Cole said: ‘Already the Welsh, Irish and Scots were protected by the framework on the basis of their national origins. ‘If you take that basic starting point, Cornwall is exactly the same. The position for Cornwall is that it is specifically a Celtic area.’ Prime Minister David Cameron, whose daughter Florence was born in the county while the Cameron family were on holiday in 2010, said Cornwall had a ‘very special place in my heart’. Florence was born during a family holiday in August 2010, and was given the middle name Endellion in honour of the village of St Endellion near where the Camerons were staying in Cornwall. Mr Cameron told BBC Radio Cornwall: ‘I am very proud of the fact that she was born in Cornwall, very proud of the fact that she carries the name Endellion - a church which means a lot to me. Beautiful: Porthtowan beach, near Redruth in Cornwall. Today;s announcement means when Government policy is considered, ministers will have to think how this will affect people in Cornwall . ‘I've been to a wedding of one of my best friends there and very sadly buried another of my friends there. Cornwall has a very special place in my heart. After 15 years of vigorous campaigning, Cornwall today moved closer to gaining greater cultural and political recognition. The announcement means when Government policy is considered, ministers will have to think how this will affect people in Cornwall. Campaigners say there could now be social, education and broadcasting policy which benefits Cornwall more than in the past. The Cornish will be recognised as a national minority under the European Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities - meaning they will be afforded the same 'protections' when policy is considered as the Welsh, Scottish and the Irish. The full details of any economic benefit borne from Cornwall's inclusion in the convention have yet to be known, though it is billed as helping strengthen the Cornish brand, as well as recognise the distinctiveness of the Cornish. Campaigners on the peninsula have long argued the region deserves special measures - including fuel duty reductions - in recognition of its cultural heritage and geographical location. They had also claimed that decisions affecting them were . being made in Westminster without their input. The measure commits Britain to preserving and promoting the Cornish identity, but does not bring extra money. ‘I love it when we go down to Cornwall now and Florence is there. Some shopkeepers single her out for special attention and say “well I want to talk to the Cornish one first”. So she gets the pasty before anybody else.’ Communities Minister Stephen Williams added: ‘This is a great day for the people of Cornwall who have long campaigned for the distinctiveness and identity of the Cornish people to be recognised officially. ‘The . Cornish and Welsh are the oldest peoples on this island and as a proud . Welshman I look forward to seeing Saint Piran's Flag flying with extra . Celtic pride on March 5 next year.’ Campaigners have taken their message to Westminster in recent years after concerns policies affecting them were being made from Whitehall without their consideration. Half a million people signed a petition - swelled by support from newspapers including the Western Morning News - opposing 2012's controversial ‘pasty tax’. And thousands marched through Cornwall and in Westminster in an ultimately successful effort to get the Government to reverse plans imposing VAT on hot Cornish pasties. Independent Cornwall Councillor Bert Biscoe, who worked on the campaign, said: ‘I very much welcome that the Cornish as a group can stand equally beside all other groups in British society.’ Fellow campaigner and comedian Edward . Rowe, also known as the Kernow King, added: ‘This is obviously great . news for the people of Cornwall. ‘I . think there is always going to be a certain degree of pessimism when . politicians are involved - are they going to be chasing votes, for . example. ‘But it is great for Cornwall to get the recognition for its culture and heritage that it deserves.’ In the spotlight: A tongue-in-cheek plot played out in the BBC¿s spoof comedy W1A last month looked at the issue of Cornwall being under-represented on the Corporation . North . Cornwall MP Dan Rogerson said: ‘Today's announcement means that the . Cornish will finally be recognised as one of the constituent peoples of . the UK alongside the Welsh, Scottish and Irish. Backing: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the Government would invest a further £120,000 into the Cornish Language Partnership . ‘It will also make sure that public institutions take account of Cornwall's unique identity.' The Liberal Democrat added: ‘Despite the fact that the last Labour Government said that the Cornish couldn't be recognised in this way, Liberal Democrats in Coalition Government have made sure that the Cornish people, and our traditions, culture and heritage, now have the same status as everyone else.' The announcement follows previous commitments, which included formal recognition of the Cornish language. In March, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the Government would be investing a further £120,000 into the Cornish Language Partnership to promote and develop the language. Mr Cole added: ‘In 2002, the Government recognised the Cornish language through a charter, and it's putting money in to help with the revival. ‘So we've always been arguing that it's a bit silly - you're recognising a minority language, but not a minority group from which it came. What they've done today is to close the circle.’ Residents of Cornwall traditionally spoke a Celtic language similar to that of France's Brittany region. Separately, a tongue-in-cheek plot played out in the BBC’s spoof comedy W1A last month looked at the issue of Cornwall being under-represented on the Corporation. A fictional local presenter in the series - which looks at what might go on behind closed doors at the BBC - felt that she could not work as a national presenter because of a perceived anti-Cornish bias. The series, which ran for four episodes as a follow-up to Twenty Twelve, starred Hugh Bonneville.","Cornish people will now receive same rights as other minorities in UK .

"The FA's racism investigation into Malky Mackay and Iain Moody has escalated after it emerged a former Cardiff City official submitted a written complaint to the governing body claiming he was a victim of discrimination. Alisher Apsalyamov is from Kazakhstan and was horrified to discover he allegedly became known to Mackay and Moody as 'Chemical Ali' during his time at the club. Mackay, now in charge of Wigan Athletic after his controversial appointment last month, and former Cardiff head of recruitment Moody are still awaiting the outcome of the FA inquiry into an exchange of racist, homophobic and sexist messages first revealed by Sportsmail.

FA facing backlash with Mackay and Iain Moody set to escape punishment . How Matt Lawton's exclusive story on Mackay rocked football... But the FA have taken more than three months to reach a conclusion partly because of the efforts they have made to secure evidence from potential victims and witnesses. While FA lawyers wrestle with the issue of private and public communication, an attempt has apparently been made to establish if a culture of discrimination existed when Mackay and Moody were in power at the club. This is understood to have included asking players, among them former Cardiff midfielder Ibrahim Farah, to give evidence. Farah, who is Welsh of Somali heritage, claimed in a tweet that Mackay would refer to him as the ‘wee Egyptian’, only to then delete the allegation. Sportsmail understands that in the email and text exchanges between Mackay and Moody seized by Cardiff investigators at Moody’s home, Apsalyamov was referred to as ‘Chemical Ali’. This is a reference to the late cousin of Saddam Hussein and former Iraqi military commander who earned his nickname for his use of chemical weapons. Apsalyamov is believed to have seen these messages, and others in which he features, and submitted a statement to the FA outlining problems he endured working under Moody and Mackay. Apsalyamov replaced Moody last year as head of recruitment. The well-educated son of one of the richest men in Kazakhstan, and personal friend of Cardiff owner Vincent Tan, had been at the club on a 12-month internship to learn every aspect of running a football club.

In his statement to the FA, Apsalyamov is understood to complain he was ostracised by staff after Moody’s departure. Wigan and Mackay’s agent, Raymond Sparkes, declined to comment. The FA investigation is ongoing.

"Charged: Jamshid Muhtorov from Uzbekista that the United States and the United Nations helped relocate to Colorado now faces a terrorism charge . An immigrant from Uzbekistan that was helped to relocate to Colorado by the United States and the United Nations is now facing a terrorism charge. Jamshid Muhtorov, fled his country at night disguised as a woman ion 2007, and settled with his family in . Aurora, a Denver suburb. The 35-year-old had opposed Uzbekistan's dictator following a 2005 massacre, endured severe beatings during a brutal detention, and saw his sister arrested on a false murder charge. But he's now accused of providing material support and attempting to provide material support to the Islamic Jihad Union. The violent group opposes the Uzbek government and has been designated a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department. Authorities arrested Muhtorov in Chicago on January 21, the Denver Post reported. Charges: Muhtorov is accused of providing material support to the Islamic Jihad Union. The violent group opposes the Uzbek government and has been designated a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department (file photo) Questions: According to police records, this is the home of Jamshid Muhtorov -  he and his family resettled in Aurora, a Denver suburb, and obtained a job as a truck driver . Federal authorities say the Islamic Jihad Union has claimed responsibility for attacks on coalition forces in Afghanistan, including a March 2008 suicide attack on a U.S. base. The group is also blamed for carrying out simultaneous suicide bombings of the U.S. and Israeli embassies and a prosecutor's office in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. 'It is a crime, and has been a crime for many years, to provide material support for a designated terrorist organization, the IJU,' said Dean Boyd, spokesman for the U.S. Department of Justice in Washington. 'Our job is to enforce the law.' The 35-year-old had opposed Uzbekistan's dictator following a 2005 massacre, endured a serve beatings during a brutal detention, and saw his sister arrested on a false murder charge . Muhtorov and his family resettled in Aurora, a Denver suburb, and obtained a job as a truck driver. Muhtorov's . colleagues at the UZ Auto Trans company, where he hauled cars for . dealers to destinations across the country, knew that he opposed the . Uzbek regime. 'I knew . him as a good guy. Praying. He never talked bad about the U.S. Maybe he . was angry with the regime back in Uzbekistan,' said Ishmael Abdubafour, a . former truck driver with the company. 'He . had the long beard and stuff, but that doesn't mean anything. We see a . lot of people who have the beard. He was very gentle.' In Uzbekistan, Muhtorov worked within the confines of dictator Islam Karimov's system for the Ezgulik Human Rights Society . The FBI said Muhtorov communicated with a contact with the IJU by email using code words, asking to be invited to the 'wedding.' He also told the contact that he was 'ready for any task, even with the risk of dying,' the FBI said. Authorities said there was no evidence that Muhtorov planned any attacks within the U.S. Uzbekistan, which borders Afghanistan to the north, has become even more crucial to the U.S. war effort now that supply routes in Pakistan are closed. American officials had described Muhtorov as a human rights worker whose activism began while he was trying to make a living in his home city, Jizzak. He ran up against corrupt officials expecting payments, which is common in Uzbekistan, and spoke out. The U.S. tracked his case and a 2005 Department of State 'country report' on Uzbekistan said Muhtorov's sister, Dildora Muhtarova, was arrested on a murder charge and detained. Such tactics, the report said, were aimed at intimidating activists to prevent them from exposing corruption. Muhtorov worked within the confines of dictator Islam Karimov's system for the Ezgulik Human Rights Society, one of two registered groups that were allowed, according to a 2006 U.S. Embassy cable that surfaced through WikiLeaks. After becoming director of Ezguli, Muhtorov eventually joined the Free Peasants Party, which favored regime change and worked closely with Human Rights Watch, but in January 2006, he was detained with another activist. Uzbek authorities beat him and released him only after he wrote statements promising not to write internet articles or to oppose the government, according to Human Rights Watch reports. 'His nose was broken. He was covered in blood. And the assailants told him, 'This is your last warning.' ... He was scared to go back to his family home, so he went to Tashkent (the capital),' said Hugh Williamson, director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division. 'But then he came back again a few days later and was beaten up again. This time, he lost consciousness.' State records show that as many as 157 .

"Jimmy Bullard in the jungle was a sad, sorry sight. In some ways it epitomised what’s wrong with English football – too many who have the privilege of being involved in our beautiful game see it as one big joke. Bullard became the first contestant to be voted off the ITV show on Monday after topping the public vote. VIDEO Scrollfor Jimmy Bullard blames editing for making him look like a bully . Jimmy Bullard was booted out of the jungle on Monday after topping the public vote . Bullard gave fellow contestant Jake Quickenden some stick during the show . Don’t get me wrong, apart from the unnecessary and annoying shouting, Bullard seemed to enjoy being Down Under, and the bullying of non-league footballer-turned-X-factor-reject Jake Quickenden (which was passed off as ‘banter’, the standard fallback excuse used by those who enjoy putting others down in a sad attempt to make themselves look good), the former Hull City midfielder was one of the entertainers in this current series of I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here. But he was wasted in there. Watching Bullard lose his nerve in a tomb of rats and literally running away because he was so scared, you might be forgiven for thinking he isn’t the kind of guy you’d want next to you in the trenches. Bullard grimaces during the Bushtucker Trial 'Vile Vineyard' You might be right in those circumstances, with hunger and darkness overwhelming him, and home thousands of miles away (although Edwina Currie managed to see it through). But in football terms, Bullard was brave. I’ll give you two examples from early in his career. Firstly back in 2002, I commentated on an FA Cup tie at Darlington in which Jimmy was playing for Peterborough United. (Ironically, in his excellent autobiography published recently, EastEnder Bullard described moving to Peterborough as like ‘emigrating to Australia’). This Cup tie at Darlington was crucial – the winner would face Newcastle – led by Sir Bobby Robson and Alan Shearer - at home in the fourth round. A massive money-spinner for either Darlington or Posh. Bullard in action for Peterborough against Oldham Athletic back in 2003 . The home side went 2-0 in front and even missed a twice-taken penalty. Posh pulled one back, and then won a penalty. The previous week Bullard had missed not one but two spot-kicks against Port Vale. The first was saved by the keeper low to his left, the second saved low to his right. Despite his Vale fail the week before, Bullard was desperate to take it, so he grabbed the ball and hit the net. Posh won the replay and earned a small fortune from the Newcastle tie. That’s bottle from Bullard. The second example came later that same season, shortly before Bullard earned a move to Wigan on his way to the Premier League. I was in the away end as Posh travelled to Stockport. Bullard's sparkling form for Fulham earned him a call-up to the England squad in 2008 . Posh were shocking, truly terrible, and were comfortably beaten, the 2-1 scoreline at the end flattered Peterborough. But Bullard stood out head and shoulders above everybody else on the pitch. Despite being 2-0 behind, he wanted the ball all the time. He wanted to take responsibility; he wanted to make things happen. He was the one running back to the keeper to receive the ball and start something off, trying to get his team into the game. In football terms, that’s brave – when your team is terrible, you’re being soundly beaten, none of your team-mates are on your level, yet you don’t hide, you don’t belt it long up the field as far away as possible. The midfielder's career was hampered by some serious injury problems . No, instead, Jimmy Bullard wanted to have the ball at his feet and be a footballer. Despite defeat that night at Edgeley Park, I came away from that game full of respect for Bullard. It’s interesting that in his book Bullard seems to crave the acceptance of fans for his comedy antics rather than his ability. Staring at Duncan Ferguson, mocking Phil Brown, diving over a load of team-mates in a penalty area. As Bullard wrote: ‘It’s always about the stuff that I did around football, rather than the football itself.’ The last time Jimmy and I spoke before he went off to Australia was when he came in to do some work at talkSPORT. Bullard finished his playing days at League One outfit MK Dons in 2012 . He accused me of ‘leaving one on him’. Roughly translated this means he was upset that I had suggested that him and David Bentley singing the Postman Pat song to Fabio Capello’s face during an England training session wasn’t a wise course of action. Mildly amusing? Yes. The right attitude at an international training camp? No, of course not. And I think most people who care about football would feel the same, and would therefore ‘leave one on him’. Nothing wrong with joking around, but sometimes you need to rein it in. Bullard is good company and a great laugh. But I can’t help thinking football is missing out without him. It should not have been I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here for Jimmy, it should be: ‘I was a naturally talented footballer, get me out of here so I can pass on my knowledge to young players’.","Former footballer was booted off reality show on Monday after topping vote .

"Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli is the subject of an FA investigation into alleged anti-Semitism. The Italian striker re-posted an image to his Instagram account of the gaming character Super Mario which read: 'Don't be racist — be like Mario. He's an Italian plumber created by Japanese people who speaks English and looks like a Mexican.' At the bottom the image included the words: '... jumps like a black man and grabs coins like a Jew.' If Balotelli is charged by the FA he could face a five-match ban. VIDEO Scroll down to see  Balotelli's latest weird yet wonderful TV advert . Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli posted the image on Monday before swiftly deleting it . Balotelli has not been impressive  since arriving this summer, and is yet to score a Premier League goal . Nicolas Anelka was banned for five matches and fined £80,000 by the FA in February of this year after making the controversial 'quenelle' gesture after scoring for West Brom against West Ham. The Frenchman denied that his 'inverted Nazi salute' was anti-Semitic. Balotelli then appeared to delete the image before denying he had made an offensive anti-Semitic reference. 'My Mom is jewish so all of u shut up please,' he said on Twittter. A spokesperson for the FA was quoted in the Guardian saying the governing body was looking into the matter. They can take action if they believe Balotelli has 'bought the game into disrepute by making comments which included a reference to ethnic origin and/or colour and/or race'. 'We are aware of the posting which has since been promptly deleted by the player,' a Liverpool spokesman said. 'We will be speaking to the player about the issue.' Balotelli had already deleted a photoshopped image of him being bitten in the arm by former Liverpool man Luis Suarez, in reference to the Uruguayan striker's ban for biting Giorgio Chiellini in the World Cup in June. Italian striker Balotelli soon posted a defence for the image, saying his mother is Jewish . Balotelli's mocked up picture, pretending to show Luis Suarez's biting his arm, was also deleted on Monday . The original picture was taken by a man wearing a USA shirt, and has been adapted by the Italian striker . Former FA executive and current chief executive of the Jewish Leadership Council, Simon Johnson, believes Balotelli should be investigated. He told the Daily Telegraph: 'We abhor all forms of racism, wherever it is found. 'We call upon the FA to investigate this offensive social media post and to take action if appropriate if we are to succeed in kicking racism out of football.' Balotelli's post comes after Rio Ferdinand was fined £45,000 in 2012 for his 'choc ice' tweet aimed at Ashley Cole after he gave evidence at John Terry's racism trial. And just last month, Wigan owner Dave Whelan was charged by the FA for making comments about Jewish and Chinese people after the Championship club appointed Malky Mackay as their new boss. Mackay himself is under investigation by the FA for sending racist, sexist and homophobic messages while he was the manager of Cardiff City. Whelan  told the Guardian he believed 'Jewish people chase money more than everybody else'. Sportsmail takes a look at some more of Balotelli's on and off-field incidents during his time in English football. CAR CRASH (August 2010) Just days after signing for City, Balotelli hits the headlines after crashing his Audi R8 en route to the club's training ground. Balotelli is found to be carrying £5,000 in cash at the time of the accident and when police ask why, he reportedly replies: 'Because I am rich.' FIRST RED CARD (November 2010) Balotelli scores his first Premier League goals in a 2-0 win at West Brom but the achievement is marred when he is sent off following a clash with Youssouf Mulumbu. WILSHERE SNUB (December 2010) City boss Roberto Mancini says Balotelli must change his attitude following his claims he had never heard of Jack Wilshere after beating the Arsenal midfielder to FIFA's Young Player of the Year award. DART-THROWING INCIDENT (March 2011) Balotelli again hits trouble after it emerges he threw a dart at a City youth team player. No one was hurt in the incident and he escapes punishment. SECOND RED CARD (March 2011) Balotelli apologises to his team-mates after he is sent off during a Europa League tie with Dynamo Kiev for a reckless challenge on Goran Popov. BACK-HEEL BLUNDER (July 2011) Balotelli is immediately substituted by an enraged Mancini after performing a pirouette and back-heeling wide when clean through on goal in a pre-season friendly against the Los Angeles Galaxy. FIREWORKS AT HOME (October 2011) Ten firefighters used breathing apparatus as they put out a blaze at Balotelli's  £7,500-a-month house in Mottram St Andrew, Cheshire, after fireworks were set off in a bathroom. The Italian was left with a repair bill of £400,000. THIRD RED CARD (November 2011) The third red card of Balotelli's City career arrives in a league match against Liverpool, the 21-year-old dismissed for two yellow cards. BREAKING CURFEW (December 2011) Balotelli breaks a club 48-hour curfew by visiting a curry house ahead of a match against Chelsea. RICHARDS CLASH (December 2011) Just days after Balotelli's curfew lapse, he again attracts negative headlines after pictures emerge of a training-ground bust-up with team-mate Micah Richards. PARKER CLASH (January 2012) Balotelli is charged with violent conduct by the Football Association, and subsequently handed a four-match ban, after appearing to stamp on the head of Tottenham's Scott Parker during a Premier League match. INTER PRESS CONFERENCE (March 2012) Balotelli gatecrashes the press conference to announce the appointment of Andrea Stramaccioni as Inter Milan's new coach. FOURTH RED CARD (April 2012) Balotelli is sent off for two bookable challenges on Arsenal full-back Bacary Sagna. Also guilty of a shocking knee-high challenge on Gunners midfielder Alex Song. CLASH WITH MANCINI (January 2013) Balotelli clashes with Mancini during training with the pair pulled apart by coaches.","Mario Balotelli re-posted an image on Instagram of Super Mario which included the words: 'Jumps like a black man and grabs coins like a Jew'

"A film director has documented how his family went bankrupt after his father became obsessed with Beanie Babies. Chris Robinson's father started collecting the cuddly toys in the belief they would make a great investment. But the Los Angeles family realised there was a problem when, after spending $100,000 on the stuffed animals, there was still no return on the investment. Scroll down for video . Chris Robinson's father (pictured) started collecting Beanie Babies in the hope of making enough money to send his three sons to college . The family spent $100,000 on the toys, but realised there was a problem when there was no return on the investment . Mr Robinson's entire family were roped into collecting the toys. Pictured is his younger brother . Mr Robinson has now filmed his family as they talk about the years spent collecting the Beanie Babies, in a bid to make enough money to send the three sons to college. His film, Bankrupt by Beanies, shows how his father's obsession consumed the family's activities as they attempted to collect as many as they could. Surrounded by boxes of the cuddly . toys, his father opens the film by telling the camera: 'This is like . admitting to a drug addiction, you know, you want to forget it.' He . goes on to describe how at first his three sons enjoyed collecting the . toys, but one by one their interest waned to the point where he only . continued to pursue his obsession in the hope it would make a financial . return. The film-maker's mother (pictured) has said they initially thought they could make a profit on the toys - but they never sold them . The family's home has boxes piled high full of the stuffed toys . The Beanie Babies were first introduced to the public in 1993, when creators Ty Warner Inc, which later became Ty Inc, launched its original line consisting of just nine characters. Over the next few years however hundreds of different types of Beanie Baby were produced as they gained in popularity. The company made an empire worth more than $6billion from the toys, boosted by the increase in people buying them as popular collectibles in 1995. At the peak of the collecting craze, many believed the designs which had been 'retired' would rise in value. Chris Robinson was led to believe the toys were collectibles after he bought the first one, which sparked his obsession. The craze however failed to last much longer than 1999, when Ty announced it would no longer be making the toys, and even made a bear called The End. Nowadays hundreds of the cuddly toys are sold on sites such as ebay - but they are not always worth as much money as collectors would originally have hoped. Sellers this afternoon were advertising 'bulk' lots of Beanie Babies, which included up to 15 of the toys for just $29.99. There are however some which have certainly increased in price, including one 'ultra rare' Ty Princess Diana Di Beanie Baby, first edition, which was listed on the site at $6,500 this afternoon and had seven watchers. He says that is when . he started to think: 'Well what am I doing it for? Ok, I'm doing it for . a college education, which so far has never taken place because I guess . I lost a lot of money.' His wife goes on to say how the family were under the impression they could make money from the toys. She says: 'Probably from about six months from when we started buying them we were able to realise we could buy them then turn around and make a profit on them - although that was the plan, it never happened because we never sold them, we just bought them.' Mr Robinson has now told Dazeddigital.com how the entire family became wrapped up in the obsession. He said: 'It became this all-consuming family activity, filling up any free time that wasn’t already earmarked for school or our youth hockey teams.' He even says one of his friends had to go to hospital because he ate too much McDonalds in a bid to gather the Beanie Babies. He said the first Beanies were bought when his younger brother Taylor was with his parents in Boston where he saw one of the toys and wanted one. His father was then told they were collectors items, which led the family into the obsession over the next few years. But now he says he has little hope of ever seeing the money spent on the toys again. He . said: 'The plan going in was for them to pay for our college tuition, . but it became pretty clear that wasn’t going to happen for us. 'Maybe by the time our kids graduate high school they’ll have made a comeback.' Mr Robinson's father was told the toys would become valuable, but the family are still waiting for them to be in fashion again .","Father began collecting toys hoping they could fund sons through college .

The steps that the League wishes the club to take – to remove Mr Cellino only to re-appoint him in three months’ time - will be destabilising for the club, its supporters and sponsors and cannot be in the best interests of any party. That could prove more difficult if Cellino faces further sanctions. The Italian, who successfully appealed against the League’s decision to block his takeover of Leeds in April, was plunged into limbo yesterday after the Football League received detailed evidence from the Italian court in Cagliari that convicted him of tax evasion in March. Last night, the 58-year-old indicated he would appeal within the 14 days allowed. Even if he fails to have the decision overturned, the disqualifying condition only runs until March 18 next year because the tax conviction will be declared spent under UK law. However, Cellino faces further disciplinary action because of his non-disclosure of the information. Cellino could escape with a three and a half month ban, but his failure to cooperate will now be reviewed by the Football Disciplinary Commission; a body with unlimited sanctions that could even see the club expelled from the league. A further possible complication is the fact that Cellino is facing a similar tax evasion trial, again over unpaid import duty on a boat. The case was delayed because the judge, having heard the first trial, felt compromised. Yesterday a Football League statement said: ‘At its meeting last week, the board considered the reasoned judgment of the Italian court against Mr Cellino, having successfully applied to the Italian courts for its full disclosure. Hollywood actor Verne Troyer (centre) poses with Cellino's daughter Eleonora at Elland Road on Saturday . The board considered detailed legal advice and agreed unanimously [with the exception of its chief executive, Shaun Harvey, who did not take part in the debate or vote having declared an interest] that Mr Cellino is subject to a disqualifying condition under the terms of the test. ‘Additionally, the board concluded it was appropriate to ask an independent football disciplinary commission to consider whether Mr Cellino and/or Leeds United breached League regulations relating to the timely disclosure of relevant information. The matter will be heard by an FDC in due course.’ Cellino was in Bahrain yesterday and will only meet with his legal representatives today. But the Football League sanctions demand that the Leeds president reduces his personal stake in the club to less than 30 per cent from the 75 per cent he currently owns. A statement from Leeds accused the Football League of ‘destabilising’. The statue of former Leeds captain Billy Bremner stands proud outside the famous old ground . League rules give Cellino just 28 days to resign as a director of Leeds and cut his ties with the Championship club. Yesterday Cellino, who bought a 75 per cent stake of the club through a company called Eleanora Sport Limited, told the Yorkshire Post: ‘Massimo Cellino does not own Leeds. My family company owns Leeds. It is my family’s money which bought the club, not my money.’ In a separate interview with Sky he said: ‘If I am not allowed to run the club I will buy a ticket and sit with the fans but I am not going to run away. ‘I think it’s unfair and wrong. I’m surprised so much energy and so much money has been wasted to run after something that is not just. I am not a dishonest person. I I come from Italy and I love this club more than someone from Britain.’ The Board of Directors of The Football League has, once again, considered the position of Leeds United President, Massimo Cellino, under its Owners' and Directors' Test. Previously (March 2014), the Board had ruled that Mr Cellino was subject to a disqualifying condition after he was found guilty of an offence under Italian tax legislation relating to the non-payment of import duties on a boat (which resulted in him being fined €600,000). In April 2014, this decision was successfully appealed by Mr Cellino at a hearing of the Professional Conduct Committee (PCC) chaired by an independent QC (sitting alone). In reaching his verdict, Tim Kerr QC concluded that: “Mr Cellino has satisfied me that on the facts before me, what he was convicted of was not conduct which would reasonably be considered to be dishonest.” Before going on to state that: “if the reasoned ruling of the court in Cagliari discloses that the conduct of Mr Cellino was such that it would reasonably be considered to be dishonest, he would become subject to a Disqualifying Condition.” Cellino watches Leeds take on QPR back in March before his takeover had been completed . At its meeting last week, the Board considered the reasoned Judgment of the Italian Court against Mr Cellino, having successfully applied to the Italian Courts for its full disclosure. The Board considered detailed legal advice and agreed unanimously (with the exception of its Chief Executive, Shaun Harvey, who did not take part in the debate or vote having declared an interest*) that Mr Cellino is subject to a disqualifying condition under the terms of the Test. Mr Cellino is entitled to appeal the Board's decision to the PCC within 14 days. As the Judgment of the Italian Court has not been published in Italy, The Football League will not make any of its contents public. Additionally, the Board concluded that it was appropriate to ask an independent Football Disciplinary Commission (FDC) to consider whether Mr Cellino and/or Leeds United breached League regulations relating to the timely disclosure of relevant information. The matter will be heard by an FDC in due course. Editors notes: . * Shaun Harvey was Chief Executive and a Director of Leeds United between 2004 and 2013.

"A woman has told of a horrifying rape ordeal that took place at the hands of former Oregon State University football players over 16 years ago - but no one believed her. Brenda Tracy, 40, from Oregon, has bravely come forward to detail a chilling account of how she reported the rape to police, saying that she was sexually assaulted in 1998 by four men, three of them college football players. She said she was gang raped, sodomized, robbed, and then re-victimized. But a college football coach only suspended two of the players for one game and was quoted as saying his players had made ‘a bad choice.’ Tracy reported the gang rape to police in 1998. She'd told investigators the men stood around, watching it happen and cheering the others on. Speaking out: Brenda Tracy, 40, from Oregon, has bravely come forward to detail a chilling account of how she was brutally raped and sodomized 16 years ago . At one point, she said she begged one of the men to make it stop but they didn't. The men who were accused of her rape were young at the time, and one was a teenager. Two Oregon State football players, defensive back Calvin Carlyle, 18, and running back Jason Dandridge, then 20, were named as suspects in the report. The other suspects were Michael Ainsworth 18, a Southern California high school football recruit and Nakia ‘Ken’ Ware, a 23-year-old community college defensive back who was on probation. Tracy, a mother-of-two said the ordeal was so harrowing that she wanted to commit suicide afterwards. She told The Oregonian: ‘I'd decided I was going to kill myself.' Speaking through tears, she told how she underwent a rape examination at  Salem Hospital. Jenenne Stanley, the on-duty emergency room nurse at Salem Hospital that day, told investigators, ‘By all indications this was a case of non-consensual sex.’ She was also humiliated into having to relay the details of the event to her boyfriend and mother. She has never before been identified as the victim and has never before talked publicly about it. Suspects: Michael Ainsworth, 18, left, was a Southern California high school football recruit. Nakia 'Ken' Ware, right, was a 23-year-old community college defensive back, was on probation for armed robbery in California . Accused: Oregon State running back Jason Dandridge, left, was 20 when he was identified as a suspect. Oregon State defensive back Calvin Carlyle, right, was 18 when he was named as a suspect . In 1998, Brenda Tracy was 24 years old and working as a waitress. The petite blonde with shoulder-length hair, standing at 5 feet 10 inches and weighing only 140lbs, was a single mother to two boys, ages 4 and 5. ‘I had victim written all over me,’ she said. , . She had suffered childhood abuse up until the age of 5, then domestic abuse as she got older at the hands of former boyfriends and attracted the wrong sort of man. She remembers wearing a turtleneck in the summer once to cover bruising on her neck after being choked by a boyfriend. ‘My self-esteem was gone,’ Tracy said. ‘I didn't think I was worth anyone really loving me.’ Football: Tracy feels sick to her stomach that the men only got a slap on their wrist by their then coach Mike Riley head of Oregon State . A 28-page report by Corvallis Police Department details the events of the early morning hours of June 24, 1998, when Brenda Tracy's life changed. The report outlined a weekday late-night excursion from Keizer to Corvallis by Tracy and her best friend, Karmen McFadden, who were supposed to meet up with her boyfriend and a group of friends. But instead of a fun get-together, the petite woman ended up naked, in various degrees of consciousness, on the living room floor with men taking turns raping her. Afterwards, none of the four suspects asked for legal representation. However, all were read their rights and each blamed the other. They also blamed alcohol for the night's events at Carlyle's No. 3 apartment on Northwest 20th Street for what happened to  Tracy. The suspects told police the 24-year-old vomited in the restroom, asked to be left alone and said ‘No,’ at different points in the course of the seven-hour ordeal. Tracy recalls waking up with someone pouring alcohol down her throat and her clothes tossed around. Suicidal: Tracy, a single mother of two, said she was on the brink of ending her life after her assailants got off with only a slap on the wrist from OSU . She said she was assaulted with a flashlight and digitally penetrated, and someone put ice on her groin. Tracy told investigators that she woke up at another point and found Ainsworth on top of her having sex with her. The others, she said, were standing around the room, cheering. She told police she heard someone shout, ‘Yea dog!’ Yet Ainsworth told police he took Tracy's clothes off and had consensual sex with her. He said he didn't understand why Tracy would believe she was violated, despite admitting that the other men  in the room had violated her, he said, ‘Yea, but I know I didn't.’ The other players mostly denied involvement in the rape. Carlyle initially denied any sexual contact with Tracy, but he later admitted to police that he'd touched her body and participated in brief oral sex. Ware also denied having any kind of sexual intercourse with Tracy. He told police he put on a condom at one point and asked Tracy to have intercourse with him, but she declined. Dandridge, who knew Tracy from a local nightclub, told police the entire event was ‘a risky situation.’ Police obtained a search warrant for the house and found five used condoms in a bathroom wastebasket, alcohol bottles and a bag of marijuana. They also took DNA samples, including hair and fibers. ‘I remember not being able to move my arms and legs,’ Tracy said. ‘I've always wondered if I was drugged. I was like a rag doll. They were picking me up and tossing me around the whole apartment.’ But Tracy's toxicology report the following day came back negative for drugs. When it was all over, Karmen McFadden found a naked Brenda Tracy asleep on the floor under a blanket. She told police she looked outside the window and saw Ware and Ainsworth stealing money from Tracy's car, which they later returned, . When Tracy woke up, she got in the car and drove home, sobbing the whole time. She called her mother and asked her to get off work and come to her. Upon arriving home, Tracy's mother found the 24-year-old woman weeping on the couch in a fetal position. All four suspects were arrested and booked into the Benton County Jail on charges of sodomy, unlawful sexual penetration and sex abuse. Players:  Oregon State players are pictured at  Reser Stadium in Corvallis, Oregon . Ware and Ainsworth were also slapped with the additional accusation of rape. If convicted, they would have faced up to 16 years in prison, meaning that their release date would have been this year. At the time, District Attorney Pete Sandrock had a solid case on his hands, with copious amounts of evidence, witnesses willing to testify and four suspects pointing fingers at one another, but what he did not have was Tracy's cooperation. Tracy was hesitant to set the rape case in motion, in part because her boyfriend was a former OSU football player who was afraid that the explosive allegations would cause embarrassment to the entire college community. OSU head football coach Mike Riley suspended two of the men for one game and was quoted as saying they had made 'a bad choice' - a remark he now regrets making . To complicate things further, Tracy's friend Karmen McFadden was dating rape suspect Michael Ainsworth's older brother and believed that Tracy was not entirely blameless. ‘What happened to me was not my choice,’ Tracy said. ‘What they did to me was not my choice. They violated me. I was garbage to them. ‘I'd made my mind up after talking to police that I was going to do the rape examination, then I was going to go kill myself. I was going to commit suicide. ‘I was already dead.’ Looking back on her decision, Tracy said: ‘I wish I'd have pressed charges.’ She added that she feels sick to her stomach that the men only got a slap on their wrist by Oregon State head coach Mike Riley. ‘I get sick of reading articles about how great a guy the coach is,’ she said. Tracy's ordeal was widely publicized 16 years ago, but opinion on what took place was divided, with some supporting her and believing her version of events, while others questioning it. When interviewed by The Oregonian about Tracy's rape, coach Mike Riley expressed ambivalence about his own response to the allegations made against his players. ‘It's so sad to me that it still haunts her. It's scary what that means to a lady,’ Riley said . ‘Maybe retribution would have helped that. I don't know.’ He also said he regrets the 'bad choice' remark, which has been haunting Brenda Tracy for 16 years. One of the accused former players, Calvin Carlyle, went on to become an investigator for the US Department of Labor after a brief stint with the NFL. He is married and has three children. He told The Oregonian that he hasn't given much thought to 'that crazy stuff' that went on in an apartment in Corvallis 16 years ago, but added that Tracy's decision to dredge up the past has left him feeling 'humiliated.' After playing football for a short time for Canada’s Winnipeg Blue Bombers, Jason Dandridge moved out to California, where he now works as a personal trainer. He also has three children. Michael Ainsworth excelled as a freshman playing football for Berkeley in 1998, but he got swept up in an NCAA investigation into academic fraud and dropped out of college a year later. Public records show that Nakia Ware allegedly violated a restraining order in 2005 and convicted the following year of a domestic violence charge.","Brenda Tracy, 40, from Oregon has bravely come forward to detail a chilling account of how she reported the rape to police .

"Jenson Button's future is set to be decided at a McLaren board meeting on Thursday. That is the day when team executives will convene to decide on the driver line-up for 2015, with Button and Kevin Magnussen both waiting to discover whether they will be retained or let go. McLaren group chief executive Ron Dennis said following the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: ''I've not made up my mind yet, but (the decision on the driver line-up) is not mine alone, and anyway, it wouldn't be appropriate.

"Racemail's Captain Heath runs the rule over some horses that could shine in the coming weeks. UNSINKABLE (Trained by Ger Lyons) Runners from Ireland don’t figure very often in this column but this one was such an easy winner when well backed on Saturday that he must be mentioned. Has done the rounds in Britain, most recently with Scottish trainer Ian Semple. His handicap mark has plummeted and even allowing for the hike his easy win will prompt, he will still probably be on a fair mark. He likes soft ground but you may have to wait for his next run – the 2015 Irish Lincoln Handicap has been mentioned as a target. Unsinkable, pictured here ahead of the William Hill Lincoln, was a strong winner on Saturday . REGAL ENCORE (Trained by Anthony Honeyball) Included on this list but with a large question mark after his fourth place to Shelford at Chepstow on Saturday. This gelding still has a long way to go to live up to his top-notch Bumper form and he pulled far too hard to have any hope of realistically seeing out his race. But on the positive side, AP McCoy was not hard on his mount and there remains a suspicion that a big handicap prize could ultimately come his way. Question marks still hang over AP McCoy mount Regal Encore (right) but a major handicap prize in on the cards .

"A man who was a fugitive for almost two weeks after fleeing his trial a day before being convicted in the repeated group sexual assault of an 11-year-old Texas girl, smiled as he was led into court today to be sentenced to 99 years without parole. Dressed in a red jumpsuit, handcuffed and with a chain around his waist and legs, Eric McGowen was formally sentenced in the same courtroom from which he had fled on August 29. Guilty: Eric McGowen, was convicted and sentenced in 2012 to 99 years in prison for the shocking crime . McGowen, who had dyed his hair a reddish brown while on the run, will now be transferred to the Texas prison system. The 20-year-old did not say anything during the brief court hearing, and mostly looked at the floor. When asked by state District Judge Mark Morefield if there was any legal reason why the sentence shouldn't be imposed, McGowen appeared to mumble something to his attorney, Matthew Poston. Poston said his client objected to the sentence because it was 'cruel and unusual. McGowen was one of 20 men and boys who authorities say repeatedly sexually assaulted the girl on at least five occasions from mid-September through early December of 2010. He was the first defendant to stand trial in the case. McGowen, pictured prior to his escape, is among 14 adults accused of raping the girl in the shocking series of attacks that took place in the small Texas community of Cleveland . He did not say anything to reporters as he held up a piece of paper over his face while being led out of the courthouse by officers and loaded into a police car in the pouring rain. On August 29, McGowen was on trial, but never came back to court after a break in testimony. McGowen had been free on bail at the time. He fled the same day the girl tearfully testified about the attacks in her hometown of Cleveland, about 45 miles northeast of Houston.The trial, held in the nearby county seat of Liberty, went on without him and a jury the next day convicted him of aggravated sexual assault of a child and then sentenced him in absentia. Liberty County Courthouse: McGowen's trial went on without him and a jury convicted him of aggravated sexual assault of a child . Authorities tracked McGowen down to an apartment in northeast Houston and arrested him on Tuesday. Six law enforcement agencies had coordinated the search for him. McGowen was apparently caught by surprise, as he was sitting on a toilet when authorities entered the apartment and arrested him, officials said.The investigation regarding individuals who might have helped McGowen elude authorities continues, officials said.Before his trial, all six juveniles and two of the 14 adults charged had pleaded guilty. Since McGowen's conviction, four other adults have pleaded guilty and are set to be sentenced on September 21.His disappearance was the latest twist in a case that has divided the small town of Cleveland, both because of the horrific allegations and suggestions from some residents that the girl was partly responsible because of her appearance. Police began investigating after one of the girl's classmates told a teacher he saw video of her being sexually assaulted in an abandoned trailer.Prosecutors' case against McGowen included a videotaped confession and testimony from nearly a dozen witnesses, including the girl, who is now 13. Poston did not present any witnesses or evidence. Crime scene: Authorities say this is the abandoned trailer where an 11-year-old girl was sexually assaulted in November 2010 in the town of Cleveland, Texas . The . girl, who authorities haven't named, testified against McGowen, describing the series of horrendous attacks that took . place in the small Texas community of Cleveland, 45 miles from Houston. In court, the middle school student, dressed in a plaid shirt and blue jeans and wearing a gold cross around her neck, described how McGowen took her to a house in October 2010 where she had sex with multiple males. The girl said she was brought into . what she described as the 'baby room' in the house, and that McGowen and . others took turns having sex with her. Testifying under the pseudonym Regina, the girl smiled nervously and answered questions quietly. But she began to cry when prosecutors began playing a graphic video tape of her having anal sex during one of the alleged attacks. She said the video, which several jurors turned away from, was of her being assaulted by another man charged in the case. Dirty: The attacks occurred inside an abandoned mobile home, pictured, where the victim was assaulted by as many as 20 men . She identified McGowen in the film laughing in the background, telling the attacker to 'beat that ho.' 'Did the guys just take turns with you?' prosecutor Joe Warren asked. 'Yes sir,' the girl said. The girl seemed calm for most of the roughly one and a half hours she testified. She . mostly gave short answers to questions, often pausing to stare at the . floor or ceiling of the Liberty courtroom before responding. She described another alleged rape in November 2010 that started in a different Cleveland home the defendants . called the 'boom boom' room, according to prosecutors, and that . continued later at a nearby abandoned trailer. Asked by Warren if more than 20 males might have assaulted her that day, the girl responded, 'probably.' Jurors . were later shown police photos of used condoms and condom wrappers . found inside and outside the house in the November incident. Accused: Kelvin Rashad King, left, and Devo Shaun Green, right, were among those accused of raping the girl . Gang-rape: Xavier King, left, and Marcus Anthony Porchia, right, are among the 20 men and boys in the case . Three people who have pleaded guilty — two adults and a juvenile who has since turned 18 — also testified yesterday. Isaiah Ross, 22, told jurors he saw McGowen sexually assault the girl with a beer bottle. The other adult, Marcus Porchia, 28, and the teen testified they saw others assault the girl but not McGowen. Poston . questioned the girl for about six minutes, during which time he asked . whether she twice told police early in the investigation that she never . had sex with McGowen. The girl said she didn’t remember saying that. During . opening statements, Warren told jurors he would present . them with videotaped and written confessions in which McGowen admitted . to raping the girl. 'What took place to this girl was nothing better than a pack of animals attacking,' Warren said. Alleged attacker: Jared Glenn McPherson, pictured, is one of the men accused of raping the 11-year-old . The prosecutor added that while the . girl may be seen smiling and even laughing at some times on the videos, . these individuals had 'duped, tricked and talked her into doing things . against her best interests,' according to the Houston Chronicle. Authorities say the then 11-year-old was . assaulted at least five times between mid-September and early December . 2010 by a group of 20 males ranging in age from a middle school student . to a 28-year-old. During the trial, . a videotaped police interview in which McGowen admitted he and eight . other men took turns having sex with the girl, sometimes two at a time, . was shown in court, although jurors were not present. In the video, which McGowen's lawyers . argued should not be allowed as evidence, the 20-year-old initially . denied ever touching the girl, but he later broke down and told . investigators he engaged in oral sex with her, according to the Houston . Chronicle. Poston tried but failed to get the confessions thrown out, arguing that police improperly questioned McGowen. The investigation into the shocking gang-rapes began in 2010 after one of the girl's friends told a teacher he had seen a cellphone video that showed the 11-year-old being raped in an abandoned trailer. Those charged included two top athletes at the local high school and adults with criminal records. The case brought unflattering attention to Cleveland, a town of 9,000 people, after some residents suggested the girl was in part responsible for what happened, saying she wore makeup, looked older and wasn't properly supervised by her parents. Other community residents, as well as groups from outside of town, sharply criticised those suggestions. It has been complicated by a belief among many in the predominantly black neighborhood where several of the suspects live that the arrests were racially motivated. All of the suspects are black, while the girl is Hispanic. Two other adults have previously pleaded guilty, with one receiving a 15-year prison term and the other awaiting sentencing. Six juveniles who were charged also have previously pleaded guilty. They received 7-year prison terms, but their sentences were suspended and they were put on probation for that amount of time. Most of the adult defendants in the case face charges of aggravated sexual assault of a child, while four face a charge of continuous sexual abuse of a child.","Eric McGowen, 20, caught by police on Tuesday while sitting on toilet in Houston apartment .

"The Supreme Court handed a victory to religious conservatives this morning, ruling in favor of Christian craft store Hobby Lobby in its lawsuit against the federal government. In a narrow 5-4 ruling the court said 'closely held' businesses with religious ties like Hobby Lobby are eligible for exemption from a provision in Obamacare that requires private businesses to provide their employees with health care plans that cover contraception. A 'closely held' corporation is one in which more than 50 percent of the company's shares is owned by five or fewer people. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Protesters from both sides of the birth control issue Leah Hughs, left, and Students for Life President Kristin Hawkins, right, chant for their side in front of the Supreme Court this morning . Hawkins and other pro-life activists flooded the steps of the Supreme Court today to show their support for Hobby Lobby . At the heart of the case was whether Obamacare's contraception mandate violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, which states that the government 'shall not substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion' unless it has a compelling reason to do so. Hobby Lobby and aligned groups argued that providing some forms of contraception like the morning after pill were tantamount to abortion, which goes against the company's religious beliefs, because life begins at conception. The court held today that for-profit businesses are afforded the same religious protections as persons under the RFRA. 'Today’s decision is an enormous . victory for personal freedom in America,' said Joshua Hawley, a lawyer at the Beckett Fund for Religious Liberty, the organization that represented Hobby Lobby. 'This decision confirms that people of . conscience are welcome in business and that all Americans have the right to . follow their moral and social convictions in every walk of life,' he said. Alabama college student Claire Chretien, center, cries tears of joy upon finding out that the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that requiring family-owned corporations to pay for insurance coverage for contraception is a violation of federal law . Republican lawmakers and conservative institutions rushed to issue their own statements after the ruling celebrating the court's affirmation of religious liberty and its ruling against the Obama administration and its allies. 'Americans of faith and conscience have been vindicated and this will be a galvanizing moment for the vast majority of citizens who vehemently objected to this mandate and the elected leaders who thrust it upon us,' Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser said. 'Today’s Supreme Court decision makes clear that the Obama administration cannot trample on the religious freedoms that Americans hold dear,' said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a lawmaker who voted in favor of the RFRA two decades ago and filed a friend-of-the court brief in favor of Hobby Lobby. McConnell added that, 'Obamacare is the single worst piece of legislation to pass in the last 50 years.' Senator Ted Cruz, a former solicitor general for Texas who argued in front of the high court multiple times before being elected to federal office, said in a statement, 'This ruling is a repudiation of the Obama Administration’s untenable position that people with sincerely held religious beliefs should be forced to comply with an unconstitutional mandate while a parade of waivers, exemptions, and delays are granted for purely commercial and political interests.' 'The fact that Americans had to bring . this case in the first place reveals once again just how intrusive . ObamaCare is. It's a misguided one-size-fits-all policy that not only . failed to fix our healthcare system but has trampled on our . Constitutional rights,' Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement. Concerned Women for America communications director, Alison Howard, right, high fives another pro-life demonstrator outside the Supreme Court after learning that Hobby Lobby won its case against the government . The high-profile ruling is a defeat for . Democrats in Congress and progressive activists who have fought tooth and nail to protect . provisions of the president's signature law that pertain to women's . health. 'Make no mistake: Today, once again, the Supreme Court ruled against American women, Planned Parenthood, a pro-choice organization that provides women's health services, defiantly said on Twitter. 'We’re not going to let a handful of extreme bosses & politicians turn back the clock. Forward, not backward,' read another one of the organization's tweets. 'It's unacceptable that in 2014 we are still fighting over women's access to birth control,' said New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, one of 20 women serving in the upper chamber. NARAL Pro-Choice America, a leading pro-choice organization, criticized the 5-4 ruling as sexist. 'Today's decision from five male justices is a direct attack on women and our fundamental rights. This ruling goes out of its way to declare that discrimination against women isn't discrimination,' the group said in a statement. The court's three women justices, Ruth Bader Ginsberg, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagen, made up the majority of the court's dissenting side. All three women were nominated by Democratic presidents. Pro-choice activists, including the ones pictured here from the progressive group CodePink, were on the scene as well . In addressing the Supreme Court's . decision today, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters, 'Today's decision jeopardizes the health of women who are employed by these companies.' During his daily briefing Earnest said the president believes in religious liberty and that is why he and his administration have taken steps to provide religiously affiliated non-profits with exemptions from the contraception mandate. However the president does not believe that private businesses ought to be able to 'assert their personal religious views to deny their employees federally mandated benefits,' Earnest said. It is 'too . early to say' what kind of steps that the president could take even take if . he wanted to push back on the high court's decision, Earnest told reporters, but the president has said he will work with Congress to make sure the women affected by today's decision are covered. Asked if he agreed with Republicans who say the decision was 'a devastating blow' to Obamacare, Earnest said the decision applied to a 'specific' set of businesses and women and the rest of the law remains intact. What would have been a devastating blow, Earnest said, was if the Supreme Court had ruled two years ago that Obamacare violated the Constitution by requiring Americans to purchase health insurance. Obamacare supporters hold up signs outside the Supreme Court with pictures of fictional male bosses, including Mad Men's Don Draper and The Office's Michael Scott, that say 'This guy shouldn't get to decide about my birth control' Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a . chief proponent of Obamacare, slammed the court's decision as one that . 'jeopardizes women’s access to essential health care' and vowed to . 'continue to fight to preserve women’s access to contraceptive coverage . and keep bosses out of the examination room.' 'The bottom line is . that today’s decision is wrong for women. Your boss should never be . able to make your health care decisions for you,' Reid said. 'A woman's personal health decisions about choosing to use contraception and when to start a family should stay strictly between her and her doctor — not her boss,' Colorado Sen. Chuck Udall, a Democrat facing a stiff reelection battle this fall, said. 'The U.S. Supreme Court's decision unacceptably takes these choices out of doctors' offices and into the workplace,' he continued. Protestors with NARAL Pro-Choice America demonstrate in favor of the contraception mandate outside of the Supreme Court . House Pro-Choice Caucus co-chairs Louise Slaughter of New York and Diana DeGette of Colorado said in a statement blasting the decision that the Supreme Court 'has awarded another one of our precious constitutional rights – the right to free exercise of religion – to for-profit corporations.' 'Despite the Court’s attempt to single out women’s health care in today’s opinion, it leaves the door open to employers being able to deny coverage of other essential health services such as a child’s vaccine or a life-saving blood transfusion based on religious beliefs,' they said. The women also noted that the ruling would allow businesses to challenge other federal laws on religious grounds. In the majority opinion the Supreme Court stated that its ruling would not allow businesses to use the religious exemption to discriminate against employees on the basis of race because 'the government has a compelling interest in providing equal opportunity to participate in the workforce without regard to race, and prohibitions on racial discrimination are precisely tailored to achieve that critical goal.' It did not specifically address other types of workplace discrimination such as sexual orientation - something liberals are trying to ban via the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. Obama has reportedly said he will issue an Executive Order prohibiting the workplace practice if Congress does not bring the legislation for a vote.","Christian craft store Hobby Lobby sued the government over Obamacare's contraception mandate .

"It is the biggest night in television's social calendar. But before the stars trod the red carpet and the gongs were awarded at last night's Arqiva British Academy Television Awards, military-like preparations were underway. And a large part of those were happening in the Baftas style suites: lavish temples to hair, make-up and fashion set up in the confines of the luxury Corinthia hotel. There, Bafta nominees and presenters were cossetted away in the hotel's best suites where they were tanned, made-up and coiffured to within an inch of their lives by the world's top glamour hit squads. Millie Mackintosh's was given a stunning Hollywood glamour . look, Sienna Miller, flying in from the States, was given a fake tan to top up her real LA glow, while Olivia Colman had an emergency short-lived tan that wouldn't mess with continuity when she rushed back to filming today. FEMAIL went backstage to reveal exactly what went into the stars' dazzling Bafta looks... Behind the scenes: FEMAIL headed backstage to the Style Suites within the Corinthia Hotel prior to the TV Baftas to see how the stars glammed up . It may have been raining on the red carpet last night but that didn't stop the stars from exposing some skin in their showstopping gowns. And no great designer dress is complete without a golden tan so St. Tropez were on hand to give the stars their sunkissed glow. Sienna Miller, who jetted in from the U.S. giving the bash a bit of an A-list appeal, looked bang on trend in a cute powder blue Matthew Williamson frock. Get the look: The Arqiva British Academy Television Awards held at the Royal Festival Hall saw Millie Mackintosh and Sienna Miller lead the way in the style stakes and St Tropez gave them both a golden glow . As the perfect English rose, Sienna opted for a tan named just that. 'Sienna wanted a subtle glow for the red carpet. A layer of StTropez Self Tan Sensitive Bronzing Spray, was applied the day before and left on for just six hours to deliver a natural and subtle glow,' said Jules Heptonstall. As for woman of the night Olivia Colman, who took home two trophies, Jules gave her 'The Instant Glow.' He explained: 'As Olivia had been filming her next project she needed a no commitment product to give her a quick glow in time for the red carpet. 'A layer of St.Tropez Instant Wash Off Glow Body, was applied just before the ceremony. As a finishing touch St.Tropez Gold Illuminator, was added to the décolleté.' Woman of the evening: Olivia Colman, who picked up two trophies, had an instant tan and a makeover by MAC and hair by Zoe at Paul Edmonds . Glowing goddess, and former face of the brand, Millie Mackintosh was quick to get herself a gorgeous tan. The Made In Chelsea star, who is famed for her bronzed skin, opted for The Golden Goddess and was covered head-to-toe in the products. 'To give a gentle soft glow to Millie's skin one coat of St Tropez Self Tan Classic Bronzing Mist was applied all over the day before the awards. On the day a mix of St Tropez Tan Enhancing Body Moisturiser with a pump of St. Tropez Instant Wash Off Glow Mousse was applied to her legs to lift colour and add hydration. Golden glow: Kara Tointon and Binky Felstead were also treated to a red carpet glow for the evening . Behind the scenes: Millie Mackintosh donned a fluffy towel as she was pampered at the Corinthia hotel . 'To finish the look and to draw attention to Millie's great legs a little StTropez Gold Illuminator was applied down the front of the shin and thighs to add a little sheen. 'Finally a little illuminator was added to her shoulders and décolleté.' As television's finest poured onto the red carpet last night, there were flashbulbs left, right and centre so a flawless beauty look was a prerequisite. That's where M∙A∙C cosmetics worked their magic. As the official make-up partner to the Arqiva British Academy Television Awards - for the 10th consecutive year - M∙A∙C know a thing or two about Bafta beauty. Making her up: Phoebe Lettice-Thompson from Made In Chelsea was treated to a makeover by MAC Cosmetics . Picture perfect: Oona Chaplin and Claudia Winkleman looked picture perfect after their MAC makeovers . Speaking about last night's makeup trends, M∙A∙C Senior Artist, Rebecca Butterworth said: ‘Early 20th century glamour inspired last night’s beauty, with many looks referencing the vintage feel of Parades End and The Great Gatsby. 'Eyes were darkened with veils of smoke while lips took inspiration from Silent Hollywood starlets, all offset against a canvas of velvet textured skin. 'Bright reds were also hugely popular, and brought a spring/summer feel to the night.’ This year, M∙A∙C has provided make-up support for 10 of the nominated TV productions including: Game of Thrones, Girls, The Graham Norton Show, Ripper Street, Parade's End and Henry IV. Face charts: These two face charts for Olivia Colman and Claudia Winkleman show that Great Gatsby glamour was the influence . No red carpet look is complete without a bouncy set of tresses and celebrity hairdresser Mark Hill and his team were on hand to style the lock's of TV's finest. Millie, who has come to be known as the fashionista of reality TV, opted for a more understated look this year. The TV Bafta winner went for a minimal half up-do to complement her chic black strapless Sass & Bide dress. Perfect tresses: Presenter Zoe Hardman's romantic side swept waves were created by the Mark Hill team while Millie Mackintosh's half up-do was more casual than most. Zoe donned a Sophia Kah full length black dress . 'This effortless look on the red carpet was in contrast to the glitz and glam of many other celebrities this year,' said her stylist. Could this be a hint of what she might opt for on her wedding day? Presenter Zoe Hardman’s romantic side swept waves were created with Mark Hill Rock Rollers and kept in place with a spritz of Big Night Out Firm Hold Hairspray. Made in Mark Hill: The team tended to the tresses of Lucy Watson and even Andy Jordan from Made In Chelsea ahead of the big event . 'This elegant look is perfect to take you from am to pm in style,' said her hairdresser. Mr Selfridge favourite Aisling Loftus looks effortlessly red carpet ready with her loose side chignon. The Rock Chick Wave Wand was used to give a delicate wave to frame her face and fixed with Defrizzilicious Bedazzled Anti-Humidity Shine Spray to keep the frizz at bay and give a glossy finish. The key to the perfect red carpet look is the dress and House of Fraser set up a stylish dressing room within The Corinthia to help the stars dress to impress. Sipping on champagne and nibbling on chocolates, the actors and actresses browsed the rails and picked out their favourite designs.

"The son of boxing champ Evander Holyfield seems to be following in his father's athletic footsteps. Elijah Holyfield, a junior at Woodward Academy in College Park, Georgia, has just fielded an offer to play college football for the University of Oregon Ducks. That's not all either, as Yahoo Sports reports the running back has also received recruitment letters from Arkansas, Boston College, Cal, Duke, Georgia, Louisville, Michigan, Michigan State, Ohio State, Ole Miss and Wisconsin, to name just a few. Scroll down for video . Athletic genes: Elijah Holyfield (above during a visit to Ohio State) has been recruited to play college football for over 20 major universities . Famous dad: Elijah (second from right) is the son of boxing champ Evander Holyfield (third from left, pictured with his children) In fact, the young Holyfield is so good, he has been ranked as the No. 137 recruit in the country by ESPN. Overall, 22 different colleges have extended offers to the 17-year-old. 'Oregon Just offered #GoDucks!' Elijah wrote on Twitter yesterday. Elijah, Evander's only child with ex-wife Dr. Janice Itson, is also a state champion in track. And not only is Evander proud of his son, he also seems to think he will be a better athlete than he ever was. '[My dad] was saying how different it was for me and him,' Elijah told The Oregonian. 'He was picking up, as far as people knowing him, at a later age. At a younger age, he didn't have a lot of money and was a small kid and wasn't that popular. He was saying how different it is for (me), because I'm so young and all the people on me, talking to me all the time – because of him, because of me playing football. He just said to keep a cool head and just remember the main focus.' Multitalented: Elijah (far right) is also a track star, as his 4 x 100 relay team (above) placed sixth at the Georgia state championship last year . Painful memories: Evander (right) will long be remembered as the only 4-time World Heavyweight Champion, and for having fellow boxer Mike Tyson (left) bite his ear during a fight . Evander made millions over the course of his career, and is still the only 4-time World Heavyweight Champion in the history of boxing. Despite his huge success, he is perhaps best known to many for an incident in 1996 when fellow boxer Mike Tyson bit off part of his ear during his match. As for his son, Elijah says he is excited to visit Oregon later this year, but has made no choice yet on what college he might attend. 'They are always good and looked good against Michigan State this year,' Elijah said of the Ducks. 'I love the way they run the ball.

"This incredible image shows man-made clouds released into the sky by Nasa rocket as part of an experiment to study the behaviour of wind in the ionosphere, 60 miles above the Earth. The white 'tracer cloud', comprised of trimethyl aluminum, and the red cloud, comprised of lithium vapour, were dropped over the Marshall Islands in the Pacific Ocean by a Nasa Terrier-Oriole sounding rocket and a Terrier-Improved Malemute sounding rocket on Tuesday at 3.39am local time.

It serves as the medium through which high frequency radio waves, including those sent down to the ground by global positioning system satellites, travel. The ionosphere begins about 60 miles above the ground and is governed by Earth’s magnetic field, high-altitude winds, and incoming material and energy from the sun. It can be calm in certain places or times of day, and quite turbulent at others. When high frequency radio waves, such as those used for the Global Positioning System (GPS) travel through a disturbed layer of Earth's electrically charged atmosphere, the ionosphere, they can be disrupted. 'This area of the ionosphere is known for . calm days and tempestuous nights, times when the ionosphere becomes . rippled like a funhouse mirror, disturbing radio signals, and . introducing GPS errors of a half mile or more,' said Nasa.

"They have been hailed as the key to health, but now there may be some new kids on the block in the superfoods market. Where grains such as quinoa and spelt have proved popular, nutritionists are now looking at some other ancient alternatives. One of the most promising is fonio, which could soon be making its way to supermarket shelves. A crop from West Africa could be the newest superfood on the market. Fonio (shown) is drought-resistant, high in amino acids and very nutritious. This has led some to suggests it could follow in the footsteps of other successful superfoods like quinoa . Superfoods may do more harm than good, a nutrition expert has warned. Foods such as goji berries, quinoa and kale can cause a host of problems from thyroid malfunction to arthritis flare-ups, says Petronella Ravenshear . Writing in April's Vogue she said: 'My only comment about these foods is that they should be avoided'. She goes on to explain that kale - a favourite among celebrities such as Gwyneth Paltrow - and increasingly used in 'green smoothies' can 'interfere with thyroid function' when eaten raw. Eating too many grains such as quinoa, regardless of how healthy they are - can cause an overload of potentially gut-irritating compounds. According to National Geographic, the edible seeds of some of these crops could be the 'next quinoa'. Fonio for example, Africa’s oldest cereal, is rich in amino acids and is said to be the most nutritious of all Earth’s grains. Its low sugar content also makes it ideal for people with diabetes. It has gone fairly unnoticed until now, though, but that could be set to change as superfoodies seek ways to get more of a nutritious fix. Fonio also has somewhat of a spiritual aspect to it as well, as the Dogon people of Mali think the entire universe was made by the explosion of a single grain of fonio. Superfoods are popular for their high nutritional value and their minimal exposure to human tampering, making them popular organic foods. Fonio is itself also rich in protein and drought-resistant, making it an ideal crop for developing nations in West Africa struggling to cope with climate change. Fonio is seen here mixed with raw fish and pear. It has gone fairly unnoticed until now, though, but that could be set to change as superfoodies seek ways to get more of a nutritious fix. Fonio also has somewhat of a spiritual aspect to it as well, with some believing it heralded the start of the universe . Some are now trying to bring it to Western markets as well to benefit consumers, following in the footsteps of previous superfoods like spelt and quinoa. One of the problems with the rise in popularity of other crops, however, is that they have priced locals out of the market. One example is the açaí berry, which in 2009, at the height of its hype had reached 60 times its original price, meaning some who regularly ate it were not able to purchase it. The rise of superfoods like fonio, meanwhile, while also threatening a price hike, could take the pressure off some of the other crops and make farms more sustainable. And teff, too, is another superfood that is growing in popularity. This Ethiopian cereal is high in fibre and iron, and also provides protein and calcium, but is smaller and cooks faster than other crops like quinoa. Time will tell if either can grow in popularity enough to become the 'next quinoa'.","A crop from West Africa could be the newest superfood on the market .

"Brendan Rodgers has been written off way too quickly, even by some Liverpool fans. Liverpool’s results, performances, character, signings and selections can all be questioned and the manager deserves some criticism. But is now the right time to be judging Rodgers as a failure? In my view that would be harsh. The critics have put last season’s massive improvement down to Luis Suarez. There have been plenty of teams who have had a special player who didn’t achieve what Liverpool did last season (look at Spurs with Gareth Bale as a recent example). It was so much more than that, and Rodgers deserves his share of the credit for taking a team from a bang average seventh-place finish in 2012-13, to within a whisker of the title last season. He’s got a lot wrong this season, but in my view, January is going to be a massive month for the Liverpool boss. With Suarez going, he needed to bring the right strikers in during the summer, and that didn’t happen. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers is under pressure at Liverpool after a disappointing start to their season . That business up front was mystifying. Rickie Lambert was only ever going to be a squad player. Wilfred Bony and Loic Remy both looked destined for Liverpool but for reasons not made totally clear neither deal happened. And everyone thought Fabio Borini was leaving, only for the player himself to change his mind at the last moment. The Mario Balotelli move looked a little desperate, and so it has proved. So through mishap and bad fortune Liverpool have been left with one top-level striker. And he’s injured. If Rodgers can address the problem in the window, I think he has a good opportunity to turn Liverpool’s season around. Assuming everyone sticks together, including the captain. The focus has been on Steven Gerrard recently – what’s his best position? Should he be dropped? What about a new contract? Liverpool's Glen Johnson strikes late with a header to give his side a vital 1-0 victory over Stoke City at Anfield . Brendan Rodgers has been under fire after Liverpool remain in the bottom half of the Premier League . Well hang on a second. It’s not all about one player, and considering it was Gerrard’s unfortunate slip that cost Liverpool last season – and cost Rodgers a place in history - I think the captain (in my opinion the greatest player in Liverpool’s rich history) should not even be mentioning a new deal, as he did in an interview with Sportsmail in October, when he needs to get his own game sorted out – his club needs him doing it out there, not talking about contracts. The deal has been offered, so once it’s signed that should be the end of that issue. In my view, a manager who stood by Gerrard when so many were hammering him after that slip, deserves support from his captain. Times were tough for Gerrard back in April and Rodgers gave him total backing. Times are now tough for Rodgers, so the captain needs to return the favour to his boss. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard applauds the fans as they chant his name after the Stoke clash . Like Everton across the way, Liverpool Football Club has always shown a remarkable ability to stick together and support each other. If someone strays away from that, they are criticised. Right now, scrutiny of Rodgers’ ability is understandable. But a captain seemingly focused on a new deal instead of his football isn’t helping the manager. With that crucial Basle game around the corner, Gerrard needs his big game mentality – he’s done it before on massive Champions League occasions, and Liverpool will need him to do it again. It’s the least Rodgers deserves from his skipper. Win that and suddenly the pressure will ease a little bit. And if Rodgers is allowed to follow it up with some shrewd wheeling and dealing in January, he can re-establish his reputation once again. Mario Balotelli (centre) has not yet scored a Premier League goal for Liverpool since joining for £16million .","Liverpool are in the bottom half of the Premier League table after 13 games .

"You may be waiting for the clock to tick round to 5pm today so you can leave the office. But in your head, the working week is already over by then. Workers switch off for the weekend at 2.39pm on Friday, it is claimed. A study of 2,000 office staff found the majority mentally wind things down well before the official end of the day. Almost half admit they take Fridays easier than any other day. Kicking back: A majority of British workers ease up on a Friday afternoon . Six in ten feel entitled to ease up earlier on a Friday because they work more than their contracted hours throughout the week. The average worker puts at least three important things on hold until Monday, it was found. Yet more than 80 per cent said their boss still gets ‘value for money’ by employing them. Many relaxed workers admitted to . deliberately scaling down workloads to wind things up early on a Friday, . pinpointing 1.32pm as the time they really start shifting into lower . gear. By 2.39pm workers have mentally started their weekends in earnest. The survey also confirmed that the 'Friday feeling' exists - a third said their workplace has a noticeably better atmosphere on a Friday and 47 per cent said their boss is a lot more lenient on this day. The research, commissioned by British Airways, found the Friday afternoon wind-down often consists of using Facebook, arranging weekend plans and online banking. Professor Frank Bond, a leading expert in Occupational Psychology, said: 'With most people working more than their contracted hours, it is perhaps no surprise that people tend to take their foot off the pedal on Friday afternoons. It can wait: Workers confessed to ignoring emails and calls when the end of the week drew near . 'It’s certainly not ideal to have important meetings at the end of the week, as we wind down for the weekend. In most cases, that meeting can wait until Monday morning. 'A great deal of research shows that giving such control over work scheduling makes employees more productive, motivated and healthy.' A quarter regularly ignores emails on a Friday and 28 per cent often fall victim to a severe case of selective hearing when the phone rings - or push it straight to voicemail. While the average worker puts at least three important things on hold until Monday because they just can’t bear to deal with them at the end of the week. Instead, conducting online shopping, emailing friends and family and even booking holidays also featured in the top 10 activities workers were likely to sneak in at the end of the week. Although the average official finishing time was still 5pm, three in ten do sometimes get let out early and a fifth enjoy casual dress on a Friday. Robin Glover-Faure, Head of Shorthaul for British Airways, said: 'With this research revealing that Brits are switching off for the weekend slightly earlier than the traditional 5pm, it’s clear to see that planning ahead and having exciting activities lined up is more important than ever.' 1.             Facebook2.             Emailing friends and family3.             Browsing news sites4.             Banking5.             Online shopping6.             Arranging weekend plans7.             Phoning friends and family8.             Planning holidays9.             Twitter10.           Other social media .","Research by British Airways shows we mentally clock off by mid-afternoon .

"An immigrant mother and her daughter spent four years living in hotels paid for by the taxpayer while she waited for the Home Office to find the paperwork which proved she was allowed to stay in the UK. The fiasco began after 32-year-old Lucille Wanjiru, from Kenya, lost her passport, which contained a Government-issued stamp proving she had the right to live and work in the UK. The Home Office had given the stamp to Ms Wanjiru in 1999 and she had spent seven years working and living in Stevenage, Hertfordshire. Lucille Wanjiru, 32, pictured with her daughter, spent four years living in hotels paid for by the taxpayer while she waited for the Home Office to find the paperwork which proved she had the right to stay in the UK . But despite being given a replacement passport the next year, officials refused to reissue Ms Wanjiru's stamp because they claimed she had 'insufficient evidence' to prove her status. Ms Wanjiru was moved into various hotels while the Home Office attempted to track down the original paperwork which it had used to approve Ms Wanjiru's indefinite leave to remain. She and her young daughter spent four years living in the Ibis Hotel  and the Holiday Inn Express in Stevenage  - sparking a £77,000 bill paid for by Hertfordshire County Council. This week, Ms Wanjiru was finally given a Biometric Residence Permit (BRP) which allows her to stay in the UK. But she has accused Government officials of wasting a 'fortune'. Although the onus is on the applicant to provide evidence of their status in the UK, the Home Office admitted the paperwork - which it originally used to grant her status - had been 'difficult to track down'. Miss Wanjiru, who lives with her six-year-old daughter, said: 'It's simply unbelievable. This has been going on for far too long - it's just incredible. Ms Wanjiru lived in the Holiday Inn in Stevenage, pictured, for more than two-and-a-half years while she waited for her status to be approved . Ms Wanjiru was put up in hotels while she waited for the fiasco to be sorted. The bill - estimated to be around £77,000 - was picked up by Hertfordshire County Council . 'I have proved time and again that I have the right to stay here but they've done nothing about it.' Miss Wanjiru migrated to the UK from Kenya in 1994. She was granted indefinite leave to remain by the Home Office in 1999. She lost her passport - which contained proof of her right to live and work in the UK - in 2006. The Kenyan authorities reissued her passport in 2007. After that, Miss Wanjiru applied for another stamp so she could get back to work. Ms Wanjiru said: 'It must be costing a fortune - all this money has been wasted' But the Home Office rejected her claim, insisting she had not provided 'sufficient proof' of her former status. Without the stamp, Ms Wanjiru was unable to get a job. She received no benefits apart from a £80 weekly support payment for her daughter from the county council. In 2009, Hertforshire County Council's children's services team moved the pair into the £45-a-night Ibis hotel. In January 2012, the pair were relocated into the Holiday Inn Express. The 129-bedroom hotel, popular with business people, travellers and commuters, charges £59.99-a-night for a standard room. Ms Wanjiru applied to the Home Office for the replacement stamp twice more before her status was finally approved on Tuesday this week. But the  accommodation bill - paid for by Hertfordshire County Council's children's services team - is expected to reach £77,000, based on the advertised room rates. She said: 'It's been such a frustrating time. I just can't understand why the Home Office hasn't done anything until now and taken so long to sort this out. 'We've been here in this hotel for well over two years now and it must be costing a fortune - all this money has been wasted. 'All we've ever wanted is the chance to get on with our lives and for me to get another job and pay our own way in this country.' Home Office rules state the anyone who has indefinite leave in a passport that is lost, stolen or expired, or anyone who has no proof of their indefinite leave status, can have their leave transferred to a biometric residence permit (BRP). A Home Office spokesman said: 'We have reviewed Miss Wanjiru's case and will issue her with a biometric residence permit in the next week. 'She was unable to secure this before because she was unable to provide sufficient proof that she had a stamp in her original passport and since the document was issued 15 years ago it was difficult to track down the paperwork.' They added: 'All visa applications are considered on their individual merits and in line with the Immigration rules. 'The onus is on the individual to provide the required evidence to support their application.' Hertfordshire County Council spokesman said: 'We can't comment on individual cases but we can confirm there are a small number of families in Hertfordshire who are awaiting decisions about their legal status and their ability to remain in the country. 'The local authority has a responsibility under the Children's Act to make sure that any children involved have their needs met and sometimes that involves funding their accommodation and living expenses.'","Lucille Wanjiru granted indefinite leave to stay in UK by Home Office in 1999 .

"Forget paracetamol or honey and lemon. Listening to Queen’s Bohemian Rhapsody is the best way to feel better when unwell, according to a new survey. As part of a new poll, almost 90 per cent of people agreed that listening to a good tune can make people feel better when they are sick or facing difficult times. More than 80 per cent said that in the past, music had made them personally feel better when they were sick or feeling low. Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody (sung by Freddie Mercury, pictured) was voted as the top track to listen to when feeling unwell or depressed . Bohemian Rhapsody, from British rock band Queen, is the nation’s favourite song for listening to when struck down by illness, or the blues, the poll revealed. The 1975 hit is almost six minutes long and moves through several sections, including a ballad segment ending in a guitar solo, an opera passage and a hard rock section. It was written by lead singer Freddie Mercury for the band's Night at the Opera album, the most expensive single ever made at the time it was recorded. Out of a choice of ten songs, Bohemian Rhapsody was the most popular for male Britons (29 per cent) but was less popular among women (23 per cent) Dancing Queen by Abba came second, as it was the most popular song for women (28 per cent). Only 16 per cent of men named the Swedish pop group’s 1976 hit as their favourite. Pharrell Williams’ 2013 hit Happy - which was number one in 25 countries - came joint third with ‘classical music’ generally. The upbeat soul track was most popular for younger people aged 18 – 34 (30 per cent), while classical music (39 per cent) and Dancing Queen (31 per cent ) were voted most popular for over-65s. Almost 70 per cent of people agreed they like to listen to music when they don't feel well, and only 36 per cent said they prefer listening to speech than music when they don't feel well. Other favourite  tracks include Let it Be by the Beatles, Three Little Birds by Bob Marley and Angels by Robbie Williams. Michael Jackson's Billie Jean, Elvis Presley's The Wonder of You and Frank Sinatra's My Way were a . The ComRes survey - of 1,000 people - was carried out to mark the BBC Radio 2’s Faith in the World Week whose theme this year is the ‘healing power of music’. Previous research has found that listening to sad but beautiful songs by the likes of Johnny Cash or Leonard Cohen can also help you beat the blues. University of Kent psychologists found that depressed or sad people prefer to listen to beautiful music that triggers important memories, and choosing music identified as ‘beautiful’ was the only way to stop them feeling glum. More than 80 per cent of people polled said music had made them feel better when they felt sad or unwell .","Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody is Britons' favourite track when ill or sad .
