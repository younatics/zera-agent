"(CNN) -- A terminal at Detroit Metropolitan Airport was evacuated for about two hours Monday morning due to concerns over a suspicious device. The north terminal -- the smaller of the two at the airport -- was cleared to reopen around 8:30 a.m., an airport spokesman said. Earlier, screeners with the Transportation Security Administration noticed something suspicious in a passenger's carry-on luggage, said airport spokesman Michael Conway. Explosive teams looked into it, and in the meantime passengers in the terminal were moved ""a safe distance away,"" he said. The passenger carrying the suspicious item was not under arrest but was being detained, Conway said. The larger terminal continued normal operations, he said. Wayne County Airport Authority spokesman Scott Wintner later said the device was removed from the north terminal, allowing operations to be restored. No further details were given about the suspicious device. An FBI official said no explosive device was found.

"Washington (CNN) -- The question of same-sex marriage went before the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday in the first of two oral arguments this week on separate appeals. The opening public session was devoted to a California ban approved by voters. In a swirl of analysis after the event, the question was whether the justices would issue a sweeping decision this year on whether states can say who can or can't get married. Or would they leave the current patchwork of state laws in place, choosing to let state legislatures and courts sort it all out? Here are five things we learned from arguments in this case. 1. Buyer's remorse . Many of the nine justices wondered why they were deciding whether states can or should ban same sex marriage. Opponents of Proposition 8, the voter-approved measure prohibiting the practice, want the court to say that gay and lesbian couples have an ""equal protection"" right to wed. That is the constitutional issue the court agreed to decide when it accepted an appeal from the referendum's supporters. But a cautious court seemed to pull back in the 80-minute public session. Justices appear hesitant as they hear arguments . ""The problem with the case is that you're really asking, particularly because of the sociological evidence you cite, for us to go into uncharted waters,"" said Justice Anthony Kennedy, viewed by many as the one to watch on the closely divided court. ""I just wonder if the case was properly granted"" for review. The court could easily say private citizens who put the measure before the voters in 2008 do not have ""standing"" or jurisdiction to now appeal the case. That would hand gay rights supporters a narrow victory, confined only to California. It would foreclose a broader ruling that might apply to all 50 states, or even those nine states like California that have civil union laws, that stop just short of marriage for homosexual couples. 2. Kennedy's control . If there was any doubt, Tuesday arguments showed this is Kennedy's court. The 76-year-old jurist is likely to be the controlling or ""swing"" vote for however the court decides the tricky issues. Four more liberal justices appeared at least open to the idea that same-sex marriage should be allowed in California. Three more conservative justices seemed to take a more ""traditional"" view: that marriage is between one man and one woman. Justice Clarence Thomas, who does not speak at oral arguments, seems likely to agree. That leaves the moderate-conservative Kennedy possibly in the middle and perhaps ready to offer a more nuanced, compromise view. The arguments from competing lawyers appeared to be especially targeted at Kennedy's concerns. Those who have worked with him have said he often agonizes openly in tough, hot-button cases. Deciding these issues for him is not an easy intellectual exercise. That uncertainly was expressed in one remark on Tuesday during arguments when he summarized the competing legal positions and perhaps his own internal dilemma. Key questions answered . ""I think there's substance to the point that sociological information is new"" on the effect of same-sex marriage, he said. ""We have five years of information to weigh against 2,000 years of history or more. On the other hand, there is an immediate legal injury ... and that's the voice of these children. There are some 40,000 children in California, according to (a brief in the case in opposition to Proposition 8), that live with same-sex parents. And they want their parents to have full recognition and full status. The voice of those children is important in this case, don't you think?"" 3. Scalia being Scalia . A good Supreme Court argument would not be complete if there was not some rousing rhetoric from the senior associate justice. Antonin Scalia did not disappoint, and he clearly was not buying the argument same-sex marriage was a constitutional right. Consider this exchange where Scalia, the father of nine and grandfather of three dozen more, questioned his old friend Theodore Olson, the attorney opposing Proposition 8. ""I'm curious, when did it become unconstitutional to exclude homosexual couples from marriage?"" he asked. ""1791? 1868, when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted?"" Olson: ""When did it become unconstitutional to prohibit interracial marriages?"" which the court overturned in 1967. Scalia: ""Don't give me a question to my question."" That brought laughter to the courtroom. Liberal blogs had a field day with his remarks, openly questioning whether Scalia could give fair-minded consideration of the views expressed by gay rights supporters. Five things to watch . 4. Subdued liberals . The two newest justices, Barack Obama appointees Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, have shown to be no-nonsense, aggressive questioners. They questioned both sides in the argument, but neither matched the rhetorical firepower of Scalia or Chief Justice John Roberts. Kagan and Scalia got into a debate over an argument made by ""traditional"" marriage supporters -- that it promotes ""socially responsible"" procreation among a married man and woman. Scalia suggested there was considerable disagreement over the effects on children of single-sex adoption. Kagan: ""Suppose a state said 'because we think that the focus of marriage really should be on procreation, we are not going to give marriage licenses anymore to any couple where both people are over the age of 55.' Would that be constitutional?"" Charles Cooper, attorney supporting Proposition 8: ""No, your honor, it would not be constitutional."" Kagan: ""Because that's the same state interest, I would think, you know. If you are over the age of 55, you don't help us serve the government's interest in regulating procreation through marriage. So why is that different"" than denying homosexuals from marrying? Kagan: ""I can just assure you, if both the woman and the man are over the age of 55, there are not a lot of children coming out of that marriage."" Scalia, matching humor with humor: ""I suppose we could have a questionnaire at the marriage desk when people come in to get the marriage -- you know, Are you fertile, or are you not fertile?"" Laughter in the courtroom. ""I suspect this court would hold that to be an unconstitutional invasion of privacy, don't you think?"" Find out which states match your values with CNN's LGBT rights calculator . Kagan's questioning was sharp and focused and put the lawyer on the spot. But it was delivered in a methodical, even low-key fashion. She wanted an answer but was not especially eager to score points with the audience or the public at large. Contrast that with Scalia, who seems to gleefully play to the crowd. He topped Kagan's funny remark with another of his own, determined it seemed to get the last laugh. Among the justices themselves, being either an aggressive questioner or a thoughtful, more subdued questioner does not earn you points either way when it comes to voting on the merits. Each has a personal style. But public perception does count, and many progressive legal activists have lamented the fact that none of the four more liberal justices, who include Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, have the personality or inclination to be a swashbuckler in public court sessions -- giving a full-throated voice to their views. 5. Courtroom flavor . The Supreme Court has a distinct aura when big cases are argued. The audience of several hundred spectators is juiced, the justices seem more energetic and engaged in their questioning. That was true on Tuesday. Celebrities like actor/director Rob Reiner (an original legal opponent of Proposition 8) added to the flavor. The competing rallies outside the court, and the several hundred people waiting in line in the cold for a precious court seat, completed the drama. More arguments are scheduled for Wednesday on a challenge to a federal law known as the Defense of Marriage Act. That 1996 legislation denies a range of financial and other benefits to legally married same-sex couples. After that, the court will quiet down once more. The justices will sit down this week in private session -- just the nine of them -- and secretly vote at least preliminarily on these cases. Opinion-writing will be assigned, and then the task of crafting a ruling acceptable to a majority will commence. The outcome will probably not be known until late June.

"(CNN) -- Riots broke out in central Myanmar on Wednesday, authorities said, as police struggled to stop groups of Buddhists from setting fire to mosques and Muslims' homes. The violence comes after a state of emergency was declared last week in the area where clashes between the two communities first broke out, leaving at least 40 people dead. In Natalin township, rioters destroyed eight houses, 12 shops and one mosque, police said. In nearby Zigon township, 40 houses and one mosque were destroyed, they said. Police said they fired rubber bullets at rioters there. Some people were injured and admitted the hospital. The riots prompted new restrictions. Officials put dusk-to-dawn curfews in place in Natalin and Zigon, state-run TV reported late Wednesday, raising the total number of townships where a curfew is now imposed to nine. Officials on Tuesday put curfews in place in the townships of Gyobingauk, Okpo and Minhla, the New Light of Myanmar, a state-run newspaper, said. Police had reported arson attacks on Muslim properties in those three townships in recent days. U.S. authorities have issued a warning to U.S. citizens in Myanmar amid the unrest that began last week in the city of Meiktila, in the central Mandalay region, and spread to other towns. The situation has fueled fears in the commercial capital, Yangon, prompting stores to close in a popular shopping district Monday. The U.S. Embassy told U.S. citizens to avoid the Mingalar Market and Yuzana Plaza part of Yangon, the same area where the stores were shuttered. U.S. warns citizens in Myanmar amid deadly sectarian unrest . A state of emergency . During the clashes in Meiktila, which were reportedly set off by a dispute between a Muslim gold shop owner and two Buddhist sellers, rioters set fire to houses, schools and mosques, prompting thousands of residents to flee their homes. The government declared a state of emergency in the city Friday, allowing the military to help reinstate order. But as the situation there appeared to calm, authorities reported arson attacks by groups of Buddhists in other towns in the region over the weekend. The unrest highlights the fragility of ethnic relations in Myanmar, also known as Burma, as it emerges from decades of military repression. Authorities have released thousands of political prisoners and pursued peace talks with rebel groups in the past two years. President Thein Sein, who has overseen the country's initial moves toward democracy, vowed Monday ""to take action against those who led the violence and got involved in it and to expose those who flamed the conflict under the pretext of religion,"" the New Light of Myanmar reported. The U.N. humanitarian agency says that the Myanmar government estimates that more than 12,000 people have been displaced by the unrest. ""They're barricaded in schools and in a monastery,"" said Ashok Nigam, the U.N. resident coordinator in Myanmar. ""They're currently receiving humanitarian assistance provided by the government."" A Buddhist monk was reported to be among those killed when the violence initially erupted in Meiktila last week. But Win Htein, an opposition lawmaker for the area, has said that he believes the majority of the victims were Muslims. ""Most of the Muslims' houses were destroyed and burnt down,"" he said Tuesday. ""Very few are left."" Authorities have found dozens of bodies amid the wreckage left by the riots. Police confiscated weapons such as swords and machetes from groups of Buddhists -- some of them monks -- who were roaming the streets last week, officials said. Win Htein said Tuesday that the situation was improving in Meiktila, but that he was concerned that some young Buddhists were ""organizing their own security"" despite government warnings not to carry weapons. Tensions persist between Buddhists and Muslims . Growing insecurity . Unsubstantiated rumors of unrest in other parts of the country such as Yangon are spreading via text messages and social media, stoking fears among residents. ""People are feeling totally insecure, totally not safe,"" said Aye Chan Naing, the founder of Democratic Voice of Burma, an independent news website based in Chiang Mai, Thailand, less than 200 kilometers from the border with Myanmar. In one example, Si Thu, a Buddhist employee of the United Nations who lives in a mainly Muslim neighborhood of Yangon, said Tuesday he was moving his family to stay at a relative's home elsewhere in the city. ""I can't think of any political or religious aspects now,"" he said. ""I only know about how to protect my family."" The New Light of Myanmar suggested that such rumors are being ""circulated by those with ill will who want to harm peace and stability."" The clashes in Meiktila and elsewhere have drawn expressions of concern from U.N. and U.S. officials. The sudden boiling over of tensions between Buddhists and Muslims in central Myanmar follows sectarian troubles that killed scores of people in the west of the country last year. Those clashes, in Rakhine state, took place between the Buddhist majority and the Rohingya, a stateless ethnic Muslim group. Most of the victims in that unrest were Rohingya. Tens of thousands more were left living in makeshift camps, and many of them have since joined those who attempt each year to flee to Thailand and Malaysia in flimsy boats.

"Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- South African track star Oscar Pistorius, charged with murder in the shooting death of girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, is once more allowed to travel overseas after a judge lifted a bail condition Thursday restricting his movements. Judge Bert Bam said that Pistorius' passport could be held by his attorney, Barry Roux, instead of the court and that he was entitled to use it to travel outside South Africa. Bam said he saw no reason why Pistorius ""should be forbidden to leave South Africa if invited to compete overseas."" Pistorius should report his itinerary a week before leaving and hand his travel documents back over to his lawyer within 24 hours of returning to South Africa, Bam said at Pretoria's North Gauteng High Court. Pistorius not suicidal, family says . The athlete may also now drink alcohol and return home to the scene of the crime, he ruled. Bam said the magistrate who imposed the original bail restrictions last month had not included the prohibition on Pistorius returning to his home or a requirement that he report to a police station twice a week in the written court order he signed. This means those provisions, which the magistrate only mentioned verbally in court, should be ignored, Bam said. The new order represents a victory for the athlete's legal team, which went to court to request more lenient terms for his bail. Not everyone surprised about Pistorius' fall from grace . The lifting of the travel ban could mean that the Olympic and Paralympic sprinter would return to international competition ahead of his trial. If Pistorius qualifies for the Moscow World Championships in August, ""then on the basis of the 'innocent until proven guilty' principle, he would be free to run,"" Yannis Nikolaou, communications manager for the International Association of Athletics Federations, told CNN via e-mail. Invitations are at the discretion of meeting organizers, not the IAAF, he said. The IAAF will not comment on the case against Pistorius, he added. Premeditated murder charge . The athlete's lawyers argued in their appeal filing that since Pistorius was not considered a flight risk, the restrictions on his travel were unnecessary. They also argued that since alcohol and substance abuse were not factors in the case, the ban on their use was not warranted. Pistorius had no desire to use alcohol or illegal drugs, they added. Authorities charged Pistorius with premeditated murder after he shot Steenkamp in the bathroom of his Pretoria home on February 14. Pistorius, who spent eight days in jail before being freed on bail on February 22, did not attend Thursday's hearing. State prosecutor Gerrie Nel told the court Thursday that he plans to serve Pistorius with an indictment on June 4. No trial date has yet been set. Pistorius, known as the ""Blade Runner"" for competing on carbon fiber blades fitted to the stumps of his amputated legs, says he thought Steenkamp was an intruder. Prosecutors argue that he intentionally killed her after a loud argument. READ MORE: Pistorius case brings South Africa gun culture to global spotlight .

"(CNN) -- Birds do it. Bees do it. But giant pandas may need a little help. So, Saturday morning, a team of scientists and veterinarians artificially inseminated the Smithsonian National Zoo's female giant panda Mei Xiang, after determining that she and her male consort Tian Tian had ""no competent breeding"" overnight, according to a statement from the National Zoo. Time was of the essence after scientists detected an increase in Mei Xiang's urinary estrogens on Tuesday. That, combined with the panda's recent behavior, convinced the scientists she was ready to breed. ""We are hopeful that our breeding efforts will be successful this year, and we're encouraged by all the behaviors and hormonal data we've seen so far,"" said Dave Wildt, head of the Center for Species Survival at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute. ""We have an extremely small window of opportunity to perform the procedures, which is why we monitor behavior and hormones so closely."" Mei Xiang was put under general anesthesia for the artificial insemination and was expected to undergo a second procedure later Saturday. During the artificial insemination, the team of scientists and veterinarians used a combination of fresh semen collected from Tian Tian early this morning and frozen semen collected from Tian Tian in 2003, the zoo said. The pandas have one surviving cub, Tai Shan, who was born July 9, 2005, and now lives in China. Mei Xiang gave birth to a female cub on September 16, 2012. But she died one week later due to lung and liver damage. Both cubs were born as the results of artificial inseminations. The zoo said it will provide further updates on both Facebook and Twitter, with the hashtag #Panda AI.","The Smithsonian National Zoo is trying to get its female giant panda pregnant .

"(CNN) -- Two British female activists were raped two days ago in the eastern city of Benghazi and four suspects have been arrested, Libyan officials said Thursday. In a statement posted on his official Facebook page, Libya's Deputy Prime Minister Awad al-Barassi said the women, who are sisters, were kidnapped Tuesday and raped in front of their father. According to al-Barassi, the young women are British citizens who were born in Pakistan and were part of Turkish non-governmental organization IHH's aid convoy to the Gaza Strip. Al-Barassi and Libya's Interior Ministry said four men involved in the incident had been arrested and security forces in Benghazi were pursuing a fifth person. While al-Barassi said it was unclear whether the men were part of the ""revolutionary brigades"" that serve under the country's security ministries, the Interior Ministry blamed the incident on ""outlaws."" The Libyan state news agency LANA, quoting security sources in Benghazi, reported that other members of the aid group also were assaulted by a different armed group and two activists who were kidnapped are still missing. Al-Barassi said he visited the victims and met with their father at a Benghazi hospital on Thursday to apologize on behalf of the Libyan people and government for this incident. He told them it didn't represent the Libyan society and its Islamic values. He said the family was in a ""very bad psychological state."" In an interview with a Libyan TV channel, al-Barassi said the women and their father were on their way to Benghazi's Benina International Airport when they were stopped at a checkpoint nearby. The women and their father were kidnapped, and the man witnessed the rape of his daughters, he said. The deputy prime minister said he was in touch with the British ambassador to Libya throughout the day. ""We are aware of an incident in Libya, involving a number of British nationals who were part of an aid convoy. We are providing consular assistance,"" a U.K. Foreign Office spokesperson told CNN. The Interior Ministry said in a written statement that the father, along with a translator, notified police of the incident on Wednesday. Lt. Majdi al-Erfi, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry, said the family had returned to Benghazi after the aid convoy was turned back by Egyptian authorities. He said the family was on a bus when they were stopped at an ""unofficial checkpoint"" by armed young men in military uniforms. According to al-Erfi, the family was held at the checkpoint and ""its members assaulted while two outlaws ... kidnapped two of the young women and took them to a farm on the outskirts of the city to carry out the crime."" The remaining members of the humanitarian aid convoy are at the Turkish consulate in Benghazi, officials said. Al-Barassi promised the results of the investigation would be made public and said those involved would stand trial soon. He said the young women were wearing veils and ""Free Palestine"" T-shirts. Two years after the start of the revolution and a bloody civil war that overthrew Libyan dictator Moammar Qadhafi in 2011, the government is still struggling to exert its authority and control the hundreds of militias, most of which continue to operate freely across the country.

"Baghdad (CNN) -- Throngs of jubilant Iraqis, some so happy they wept, gathered early Tuesday at Baghdad's al-Shaab Stadium for the country's first international soccer match in years. ""I cannot believe my eyes,"" exclaimed Hussein Jasim, 19. He wept and shouted ""Allahu Akbar!"" or ""God is great!"" ""I have not seen in my entire life that many Iraqis gathered in one location happy, dancing and chanting,"" he said. ""I am not used to it. ... It's my happiest moment!"" A decade after the Iraq War began, Alaa Rahem felt something he hadn't in a long time in this country with tenuous peace -- optimism. ""I have been waiting for this moment,"" he said. ""It is time for Iraqis to live together peacefully. Enough killings and destruction. Let's live together peacefully like we are doing now from inside this stadium. I look around me, and I see Iraqis from different sects shouting ... 'Yes! Yes for Iraq!' "" It was the first international soccer match in Baghdad since Iraq's 4-0 victory over the Palestinian team during a friendly game in July 2009 -- and the first home game inside Iraq since the international soccer governing association, FIFA, lifted a ban last week. Under that ban, Iraq was forbidden from hosting home games after security and technical issues emerged from its loss to Jordan's team in the northern Iraqi city of Irbil in September 2011. Because Tuesday's game was ""friendly,"" the Iraqi Football Association got to choose their opponent. And it chose Syria. ""I don't see why we should not play with Syria in a friendly game,"" said Iraqi fan Khalid al-Jumaili. ""Syria is our neighbor, and they need our support. ""Syria opened its borders to all Iraqis over the past years,"" he said. ""It's time for us to pay it back to them and show our support to Syrian people."" Choosing to play Syria seemed amusing to one Iraqi fan. ""I don't know why we started our friendly game with Syria,"" Adel Zaalan said, laughing. ""I believe Iraq should have started to play a friendly game with a country that does not have internal problems. It would be much more solid start for Iraq."" ""Don't get me wrong,"" he continued. ""I am not against it at all or against Syrian people, but this could be a good propaganda for Assad regime."" There didn't appear to be any Syrian fans waving flags or holding signs with any political message at Tuesday's match. For two years, Syria has been locked in a civil war pitting the regime of President Bashar al-Assad against rebels who are trying to oust him. The rebels and human rights organizations say al-Assad's forces have committed war crimes; al-Assad claims the violence in Syria is the work of terrorists. The United Nations says the war has claimed 70,000 lives. It's highly unlikely Iraq chose to play Syria for political reasons, said CNN contributor James Montague, who wrote the book ""When Friday Comes,"" a rollicking first-person adventure through the intersection of religion, war, politics and soccer in the Middle East. Iraq needed to choose a team that was nearby, and schedules seemed to align for both teams, he said. ""And you're not going to ask a marquee team to come to Baghdad,"" Montague said. They might not be Real Madrid, but the Syrian national soccer team is nothing to sniff at. The team has been enjoying a bang-up year, Montague said. They almost qualified for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, and they made the quarterfinals of a major youth tournament last year. Despite the irony of their team's success amid the backdrop of their country's bitter civil war, the players have avoided discussing the situation in Syria, said Montague, who reported for The New York Times on Syria's Olympics qualifying match in Jordan. ""There were a lot of interpreters with the squad who seemed to deflect questions, but I have no idea if they were with the [Syrian] regime,"" he said. ""We'll probably never now what's going on behind the scenes until after the war."" While Syria descends deeper into conflict, Iraq is slowly recovering after a decade of war that divided the country along sectarian lines. On Tuesday, inside and outside Baghdad's al-Shaab Stadium, Iraqis of all ages and backgrounds agreed on one thing -- their ""Lions of the Mesopotamia"" were going to win. Six minutes into the second half, the Iraqis scored. Captain Younis Mahmoud, nicknamed ""The Ripper,"" drove the ball into the net. The Lions would take it, 2-1. Mahmoud, who sports a tattoo of Iraq on his arm, is beloved in his home country. He scored the winning goal in the Asian Football Confederation's 2007 AFC Asian Cup when the Lions beat Saudi Arabia 1-0 in a stunning victory that became a national point of pride. Mahmoud's war story is also famous, Montague notes, having moved to Qatar to be with his family despite that he could have easily taken offers from various European teams to join them. Many of Mahmoud's teammates went through hell, some telling of torture by Saddam Hussein's son Uday when they didn't perform well on the field. And then there's the specter of violence tied to matches past. During the semifinal of the 2007 Asia Cup win, two car bombs went off in Baghdad killing scores of people. ""The match today is a sign that things are improving,"" said Montague. ""It's also a huge test for the government. But for Iraqis, football is everything. The return of football is a return to normality."" CNN's Joe McCurdy contributed to this report.","First international soccer match in Baghdad in years brings Iraqis to tears .

"London (CNN) -- The death of a 14-year-old girl who was apparently fatally savaged by a pack of dogs at a friend's home has prompted horror in Britain. Greater Manchester Police formally identified the girl Wednesday as Jade Anderson. She was found dead at a house in Atherton, near Wigan in northwest England, on Tuesday afternoon after police were called about reports of an unconscious girl and ""out-of-control"" dogs. Armed officers were confronted by a pack of dogs, described as ""aggressive."" Four were killed, and a fifth, which was shut up elsewhere in the house, was contained. More clues about what sparked the attack on Jade may be revealed by an autopsy Wednesday, police said. The schoolgirl was alone at the house, which she was visiting, when she was apparently mauled, police said. The dogs' remains will be examined as part of the investigation, which will also look at the breeds involved, police said. UK newspaper reports suggest that an American bulldog, two Staffordshire bull terriers and a bull mastiff attacked the teenager. None of those breeds are banned in Britain. Police Superintendent Mark Kenny said it was ""a deeply distressing incident for everyone involved"" and expressed condolences to Jade's family. ""They are understandably devastated by what has happened, as are Jade's circle of friends,"" he said in a police statement. He told reporters later Wednesday that reports of the dogs attacking after Jade brought a meat pie into the house were speculation, but acknowledged that the attack came at lunchtime, after she'd left and returned. ""This afternoon we sadly lost one of our students, Jade Anderson. Our thoughts are with her parents and family,"" the Twitter account for her high school said. Dealing with dangerous dogs . A report by the UK parliament's Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee last month said seven people, five of them children, had been killed by dogs in homes in Britain since 2007. The cost to the National Health Service of treating severe dog attack injuries is more than 3 million pounds ($4.5 million) a year, it said. ""Current dangerous dogs laws have comprehensively failed to tackle irresponsible dog ownership,"" the report said, adding that the latest government proposals are ""woefully inadequate."" Kenny, the police superintendent, said he was not aware that any formal complaints had been made against the dogs involved in Tuesday's attack. Humane societies point out that it is often the actions of owners, rather than the particular breed, that make a dog dangerous. Animal psychologist Roger Mugford, who founded the UK-based Training and Behaviour Centre, which works with problem dogs, echoes that view. ""Everything is down to the owner,"" he told CNN. ""Owners know if their dog is a hazard or is not friendly."" In a home with several dogs, the animals could be expected to behave as a group in a territorial way, he said. ""So a stranger going into a home with five dogs would be seen as a threat, someone to be challenged or even attacked."" Once one dog attacks, the others are likely to join in, and self-defense becomes almost impossible, he added. Assuming the worst . Some breeds are banned in Britain under the Dangerous Dogs Act. They include the pit bull terrier, the Japanese Tosa, the Dogo Argentino and the Fila Braziliero, as well as dogs that may be crossbreeds but share the characteristics of these breeds. But it's not the breed involved, but how the animal has been trained that counts, Mugford said, although bigger dogs can inflict more harm if they become aggressive. ""It's a fallacy that one breed is more dangerous than another,"" he said. ""Everyone has prejudices ... but the willingness to bite is probably the same, on average, in a bichon frise as in a Great Dane."" Mugford recommends that owners take action as soon as they spot any warning signs -- by going to a dog trainer or qualified behaviorist, asking a veterinarian for advice or investing in a muzzle. ""If you have a big dog, or several big dogs, it's pretty obvious that you must take it very seriously indeed,"" he said. ""Assume that the worst can or might happen."" The laws in Britain are sufficient to protect people if they are enforced, he said. ""But more than anything, we need common sense -- punishment after the act is not the solution, we need behavior that anticipates problems."" Pit bull issue . The debate over dangerous dogs is also heated in the United States, where the Humane Society has been campaigning against a Maryland Court of Appeals ruling in August that pit bull terriers are ""inherently dangerous."" Under the ruling, dog owners and their landlords are responsible for any injuries caused by pit bulls. The Humane Society says it's wrong to discriminate by breed. ""Singling out a particular breed or type of dog has repeatedly been proven to be ineffective at curbing dog bites because breed alone is not predictive of whether a dog may pose a danger,"" its website says. ""A dog's propensity to bite is a product of several factors primarily under the owner's control, including early socialization, whether the dog is spayed or neutered and whether the dog is isolated or chained.""

"Kaufman, Texas (CNN) -- A Texas community is on edge after a district attorney who said he would put away the ""scum"" who killed a colleague two months ago was shot to death alongside his wife in his home Saturday night. Kaufman County Judge Bruce Wood said he thought there was a ""strong connection"" between the slayings of Mike and Cynthia McLelland and the shooting death of Kaufman County Assistant District Attorney Mark Hasse, who was killed on his way to work in January. Hasse and McLelland ""worked on similar cases very closely,"" said Wood, the county's top elected official. And Kaufman Mayor William Fortner told CNN that he thought the men were targeted by people seeking revenge. ""That's the logical conclusion, and I don't have any information that directs me to think that's the case, but that's what you would assume under the circumstances, since they targeted two people from our prosecutors."" The Kaufman County sheriff's office, however, won't officially say the killings are connected. ""I can't say that,"" Kaufman County Sheriff David Byrnes told reporters. ""No, we have nothing indicating that for sure."" Federal and state law enforcement descended rapidly on the crime scene to aid in the investigation. Just two months ago, McLelland vowed to find the people who killed Hasse, one of his top deputies. On Saturday, authorities found the McLellands' bodies in their home in Kaufman County, east of Dallas. ""I don't know of anyone who would want to cause him harm,"" Fortner said. ""As far as I could tell, he was doing a really good job as a district attorney."" Fortner said he hoped the killer or killers were caught ""before any more people are lost."" Wood and McLelland last spoke last week. ""He never stated to me that he was worried,"" Wood said. ""But everybody that works in the courthouse has been on edge, but he never indicated any fear to me."" Authorities are providing extra security for others, and the Kaufman County district attorney's office will be closed on Monday. ""We are taking precautions to protect other elected officials in the county,"" Byrnes told reporters Sunday. He declined to say what those measures were. Byrnes offered no details as to how the McLellands were killed. A law enforcement source told CNN that investigators at the McLellands' home recovered several shell casings at the scene of the crime. The casings are from a .223-caliber rifle, the source said. Authorities have not identified a suspect. McLelland was an Army veteran who later earned a master's degree in psychology and became a psychologist for the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation, the district attorney's website said. He was raised in the small town of Wortham, Texas, where his parents had a ranch. He joined the Army after attending the University of Texas and spent 23 years in the service. He later earned his law degree and practiced as a defense attorney and mental health judge for 18 years before becoming the county's district attorney in 2010. McLelland and his wife leave behind two daughters and three sons. One son is a Dallas police officer. Another top prosecutor slain . The McLellands were killed almost exactly two months after Hasse was shot to death in broad daylight outside the county courthouse on January 31. Hasse had feared for his life and carried a gun to work, said a Dallas attorney who described herself as his longtime friend. Colleen A. Dunbar said she spoke with Hasse on January 24. She said the prosecutor told her he had begun carrying a gun in and out of the county courthouse daily. ""He told me he would use a different exit every day because he was fearful for his life,"" Dunbar told CNN. She said that Hasse gave no specifics on why he felt threatened -- only that he did. McLelland called Hasse ""a stellar prosecutor"" who knew that threats were part of the job. He vowed after Hasse's slaying to put away the ""scum"" who killed his deputy. ""I hope that the people that did this are watching, because we're very confident that we're going to find you,"" McLelland told reporters. ""We're going to pull you out of whatever hole you're in, we're going to bring you back and let the people of Kaufman County prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law."" Attorney Pete Schulte told CNN affiliate WFAA that public servants are facing a new quandary. ""It's going to have a chilling effect on people who do want to step into those roles and (have to think about whether to) start arming themselves,"" he said. ""I mean, that's the risk that we're going to face now because of this happening."" Schulte told the station that after someone shot through the windows of his Dallas offices in November, he began to carry a gun more often. CNN's Ed Lavendera reported from Kaufman, and AnneClaire Stapleton and Holly Yan from Atlanta.","NEW: Investigators find various shell casings from a .223-caliber rifle, a source says .

"(CNN) -- Pope Francis marked his first Good Friday as the head of the Roman Catholic Church, asking the faithful to follow Jesus' lead. ""Christians must respond to evil with good, taking the cross upon themselves as Jesus did,"" Francis said at a nighttime ceremony marking the Stations of the Cross, also known as Way of the Cross or Via Crucis, at Rome's Colosseum. Francis said the cross represents God's response to evil in the world and that the answer to evil ""is the cross of Christ -- a word which is love, mercy, forgiveness."" Good Friday, one of the holiest days on the Christian calendar, recalls the day Jesus died on the cross. Jorge Bergoglio, now Pope Francis, was elected pontiff just over two weeks ago, succeeding Benedict XVI. A former Argentine cardinal, he became the first non-European pope of the modern era, the first from Latin America, the first Jesuit and the first to assume the name Francis. Since taking on the role, he has focused on a message of helping the poor and needy and demonstrated a simple, humble personal style. Francis already has repeatedly veered from tradition -- from the white papal robes he wore on the Vatican balcony the night of his election, to his choosing to ask for the crowd to pray for him first before he offered a blessing of his own. Bergoglio's journey to top of the church . His selection came shortly before Holy Week, one of the most significant periods of the Roman Catholic year. These celebrations will culminate on Easter Sunday with the pope's first ""Urbi et Orbi"" blessing, directed to the city of Rome and to the world. Celebrant references Kafka story . These remarks at one of the Italian capital's most famous landmarks came hours after the new pontiff, dressed in red vestments, began a service at the Vatican's St. Peter's Basilica by walking down its nave and laying on his stomach in prayer, according to Vatican Radio. He then joined legions of Roman Catholics worldwide who reflected Friday on the gospel account of the Lord's Passion, recalling the day Jesus died on the cross before rising three days later, according to Christian doctrine. Per tradition, the Vatican sermon was given by the preacher to the papal household, the Rev. Raniero Cantalamessa. ""We have the opportunity to make, on this day, the most important decision of our lives, one that opens wide before us the doors of eternity,"" Cantalamessa said. ""To believe!"" Opinion: Pope Francis' gestures strike fire in our hearts . During the address, he referenced author Franz Kafka's ""An Imperial Message,"" a story in which a king on his deathbed whispers a message to a subject, makes the subject repeat it, and then sends him on his way. The messenger tries to leave but encounters insurmountable obstacles as he attempts to head away. Cantalamessa said the story is a ""powerful religious symbol and takes on a new meaning, almost prophetic, when heard on Good Friday."" ""We must do everything possible so that the Church may never look like that complicated and cluttered castle described by Kafka, and the message may come out of it as free and joyous as when the messenger began his run,"" he said. ""We know what the impediments are that can restrain the messenger: dividing walls, starting with those that separate the various Christian churches from one another, the excess of bureaucracy, the residue of past ceremonials, laws and disputes, now only debris."" The Stations of the Cross . Dressed all in white, the pope arrived shortly after 9 p.m. (4 p.m. ET) at the Colosseum to mark the Stations of the Cross. As a large crowd -- many of them holding lit candles -- looked on, Francis sat solemnly as a cross was walked around the historic Roman amphitheater to recall 14 moments from Jesus' final day. Participants included clergymen and other Christians from Brazil to Africa to China to the Middle East. At one point, the cross was carried by a woman in a wheelchair, from a group representing the physically and mentally disabled. Francis spoke to close the ceremony, explaining the meaning of the cross and how Christians could apply that in their lives. ""Let us walk together in our Way of the Cross, and let us do so carrying in our hearts these words of love and forgiveness,"" he said. Similar services and ceremonies were held in churches and other locales worldwide, including the annual Stations of the Cross walk through the winding streets of Jerusalem's old city. Pope Francis' humble superiority . They came a day after Francis broke with tradition by going to a youth detention center in Rome, rather than the city's chief cathedral, where he washed the feet of a dozen young detainees. Among the group at the Casal del Marmo were two women and two Muslims. The pontiff poured water over the young offenders' feet, wiped them with a white towel and kissed them. In his homily, given to about 50 young offenders, he said that everyone should help one another. ""As a priest and as a bishop, I should be at your service. It is a duty that comes from my heart,"" he said. The act of foot-washing at the Mass of the Lord's Supper on Holy Thursday is part of the Christian tradition that mirrors Jesus' washing of his disciples' feet. The girls whose feet Francis washed -- in another move away from custom -- were an Italian and an Eastern European, according to the Vatican. The Vatican Press Office responded Friday to ""questions and concerns"" related to the pope's washing the young offenders' feet, especially those of two females, calling it a ""simple and spontaneous gesture of love, affection, forgiveness and mercy."" ""When Jesus washed the feet of those who were with him on the first Holy Thursday, he desired to teach all a lesson about the meaning of service, using a gesture that included all members of the community,"" the office said in a statement. ""... To have excluded the young women from the ritual washing of feet ... would have detracted our attention from the essence of the Holy Thursday gospel, and the very beautiful and simple gesture of a father who desired to embrace those who were on the fringes of society."" Why is the pope washing prisoners' feet? CNN's Livia Borghese and Joe Sterling contributed to this report.","NEW: Pope: Cross represents God's response to evil -- which is love and forgiveness .

"(CNN) -- Doing for our oceans what Google Street View has done on land, a team of marine scientists is building up an extraordinary picture of the world's coral reefs. Armed with the latest camera technology, the Catlin Seaview Survey is taking marine science into uncharted waters in a bid to transform our understanding of one of the planet's most diverse, but endangered eco-systems. The team has been mapping Australia's Great Barrier Reef since last September using deep water robots and a revolutionary camera called the Seaview SVII. ""I think the SVII is a game changer,"" says lead scientist, Ove Hoegh-Guldberg. ""It's automating high-definition images at a scale which has not been done before."" As well as taking 360-degree images every three seconds, the camera also records the exact location and direction of a photo using GPS, enabling scientists to accurately gauge the health of a reefs over time. ""So far we are only halfway through Catlin Seaview Survey expeditions, but we've collected almost a hundred kilometers of transects,"" Hoegh-Guldberg added. ""You just can't do that normally. You'd be taking a hundred years to do this with normal divers out there with normal cameras. So, getting that technology right has been incredibly important."" More than 50,000 photos in total will be taken during expeditions to 20 separate reefs with each image stitched together using special software. A picture of reef life is already emerging with many locations available to view on Google Earth. Watch: Pulse of the oceans . Heogh-Guldberg was one of the first marine biologists to link coral damage to climate change. And while he and others have been monitoring the effects of climate change on reefs for decades, they've never been able to do it on such a large scale. ""We don't have that global baseline for how reefs are doing across the planet. Coral reefs exist in over 50 countries and they stretch across much of the tropics and subtropics. There's 375,000 kilometers of reef around the world,"" says Hoegh-Guldberg. When the three-year project is completed, reef data will have been boosted considerably, he says. Monitoring some of the world's remotest reefs will enable scientists to more accurately answer when, where, and most importantly why coral reefs around the world are declining. ""One of the parts of the project is to create essentially a databank called 'The Global Reef Record,'"" says Hoegh-Guldberg. Huge amounts of digital video and physical measurements are being fed into a high-speed storage system, he says, and will be available to scientists all over the world. ""One of the legacies of the Catlin Seaview Survey is to create essentially that baseline information that everyone has the rights to use and then develop this complex picture of how the world is changing,"" he says. ""This is the sort of science we need to do right now to get a real picture of the risk and vulnerability to things like global change to coral reefs.""","CNN Special Correspondent joins Catlin Seaview Survey as they photograph Great Barrier Reef .

"(CNN) -- Rescuers have yet to find any survivors or bodies Saturday after a landslide that buried 83 workers at a gold mine in the Tibet Autonomous Region, reported Xinhua, the Chinese state-run news agency. The likelihood of the miners' survival of the Friday landslide are slim, a government spokesperson was quoted in the Xinhua report. Rescue efforts are ongoing, despite being hindered by additional minor landslides and altitude sickness. The mining site is located at 4,600 meters, which is 15,092 feet. Cold temperatures falling to -3 degrees Celsius (26 degrees Fahrenheit) have hampered the sniffer dogs' sense of smell and their ability to trace the trapped miners, the news agency reported. The incident occurred Friday, about 6 a.m. in Maizhokunggar County, east of Lhasa, the regional capital. The landslide extended three kilometers (almost two miles) and was made up of about 2 million cubic meters (2.6 million cubic yards) of mud, rock and other debris, according to Xinhua. The victims, including two Tibetans, were workers from Tibet Huatailong Mining Development Co. Ltd., a subsidiary of the China National Gold Group Corp., the news agency said.

"(CNN) -- Hell came to Damascus months ago. It's loud and scary in Syria's capital. But now, this week, something seems different. It feels worse. And that makes Leena feel better. The Damascus resident, who sides with the rebellion, says it means the forces fighting to oust President Bashar al-Assad are winning. ""The rebels are winning, can you see?"" she insisted during a Skype call Wednesday. ""The regime feels threatened. They are scared. You can feel it here. It's so tense."" Leena, a former teacher in her 30s, told CNN that she's hearing more helicopters hovering over her home this week. Traffic near the presidential palace is more hectic. Checkpoints are more intense. Blink, she said, and the price of gas goes higher. U.S. spearheads diplomatic push on Syria . But the chaos, the uncertainty and booms of shells landing that keep her awake at night, now fill her with hope. Damascus is the seat of al-Assad's power. Rebel forces seem to be fighting harder than ever in the capital and, according to analysts and on-the-ground observers like Leena, al-Assad is acting like a boxer who fears his own knock-out is coming. ""The worse it gets now, the more we know the rebels will win,"" she said. ""We welcome this fight. It means we will wake up from this nightmare."" In the past several weeks, the rebels -- once disorganized, dysfunctional and poorly armed -- have made major strategic and psychological gains. They have seized control of key oil fields and territory in important areas of the north. They have audaciously fired on the Damascus airport and downed several military aircraft. Syrian rebels challenge al-Assad's command of the skies . Rebels pounced on a key Air Force headquarters outside the northern city of Aleppo, seizing a large cache of weapons, and leaving the regime so desperate it bombed its own bases to prevent the rebels from getting any more. It was another blow to Syria's army, which experts say is spent, stretched thin by desertions and defections. Syrian rebels in Damascus say they are more organized, better armed with heavy weaponry, and ready to ""cleanse Syria"" of government forces, Free Syrian Army spokesman Abu Qutada told CNN. He said the rebels have ""started the ending battle"" of the war. ""We are conducting significant military operation inside the capital Damascus, this is a new stage,"" Abu Qutada said Wednesday via Skype from the Damascus suburbs. ""This is the decisive stage of our fight."" And, international support for the rebels' cause appears to be increasing. NATO recently approved sending Patriot missiles to Turkey, which supports the rebels. France and other pivotal European countries have said they also back the movement against al-Assad. Those opposed to al-Assad -- including the United States -- have said for months that the Syrian leader's days are numbered. Now, there are signs of desperation: . Al-Assad is reportedly considering his asylum options, despite insisting that he will ""live and die in Syria."" He is also reportedly considering using chemical weapons on his own people. And the Syrian government has been blamed for temporarily shutting down Internet service in the country last week, an alleged attempt to thwart rebel communication. So, with key rebel advances in the north and signs of desperation in Damascus, many observers believe the end is in sight for Syria's 21-month-old brutal civil war. The regime is clinging to the capital, Damascus, as rebels chip away at the military, according to regional analysts. And the rebels don't have the clout to go toe-to-toe with the government in the center of Damascus, according to senior analyst Joseph Holliday. ""It (the Syrian rebellion) will not be able to overthrow the Assad regime for the foreseeable future,"" wrote Holliday of the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War. But, he said, that doesn't mean a certain victory for al-Assad' forces. ""The regime does not have the forces required to hold all of Syria, and its control is steadily eroding across the country."" Attack not best way to stop Syria's chemical weapons . 'We thought it would be over fast' If this is a crossroads in the war, the road leading to it has been long and hard. Syria's conflict began in March 2011, when protesters like Leena took to the streets to peacefully call for more freedom. They were inspired by Arab Spring demonstrations that toppled dictators in Egypt and Tunisia. ""I have to tell you, we thought it would be over fast,"" Leena said. ""I never thought it would come this far. None of us expected to lose this many friends."" She pauses, her voice breaking. ""We ... knew the regime was strong, but not that ... fierce. I guess we did not expect how terrible it would be."" The most heinous acts man is capable of inflicting on others have happened in Syria. Journalists, Syrians and human rights workers say the military has gone house to house and shot dead entire families. Shelling kills 10 children on a playground . Children, they say, have been abducted, tortured and killed and dumped on their parents' front door. There are allegations of underground torture facilities across the country. The Syrian government denies it is targeting its own people, saying it has gone after ""terrorists"" that are seeking to overthrow the government. While it's tough to pin down estimates of regime forces and rebel fighters, most analysts agree that the Syrian government still retains vast superiority in firepower over the rebel fighters. Yet there's a ""turning process"" going on in Syria, according to analyst Jeffrey White, who recently visited the region. ""Morale, combat spirit (within regime forces) seems to be degrading,"" said White, a defense fellow at The Washington Institute for Near East Policy. ""The rebels are getting stronger, they keep forming units, they keep getting defectors, they keep getting personnel."" The rebel movement has grown bottom-up, a fighting force replete with Syrian army defectors, Syrian citizens, and Islamists -- from inside and outside the country. Regional commands are emerging, and units are working together. The government has ceded huge swaths of territory in the north, and hasn't been able to oust rebels from the most populous city of Aleppo, which is almost fully under rebel control. As fighting subsides, Aleppo residents find little left . ""The opposition pretty much owns Syria,"" said Michael Weiss, research director at the UK-based Henry Jackson Society. ""The regime hardcore -- they are in the red in the ledger now, not in the black."" The rebels have now emerged as a ""quasi-professional army."" He said their advances have made make it ""much easier to impose a no-fly zone in the north of Syria"" -- if that happens. Yet, the Syrian military hopes to gain advantage with its superior firepower by locking down key urban centers, such as Damascus and Homs. But Weiss notes that the government hasn't had a major military victory in the north of Syria for months, and the rebels have effectively encircled Damascus. It also hasn't embarked on major ground offensives, like the one in Aleppo earlier this year. Such activity puts the army at risk of more defections and desertions. Syria's Assad regime has fight left despite rebels' advances . Frustration, optimism . As analysts study every move by the rebels and government forces to determine Syria's endgame, the people living there -- some filled with hope, others mired in frustration -- want to know when it will end. Echoing a common sentiment among many Syrians, a Syrian blogger in Homs, who calls himself ""Big Al,"" says recent attempts by the international community are all too little, too late. ""Syrians are doing things on their own and no one will help them,"" he told CNN. ""The world watched and is still watching Syrians get slaughtered and did nothing and will continue to do nothing, so empty threats mean nothing to us,"" he said. He dismissed recent reports that NATO had approved deploying Patriot missiles near the Turkey-Syrian border as an ""empty threat."" He also rejected the recent outcry over the threat of chemical weapons against Syrians, saying, ""the only reason they're saying these threats is to pretend that they might actually do something and they won't."" ""They only don't want chemical weapons to be used against Israel but I know, and everyone here knows, that if they were used against Syrians, nothing will happen and no threats will come true."" In Damascus, Leena remains optimistic about an impending rebel victory -- but she admits that the nearly two-year-long road to revolution has changed her and others risking their lives for a new Syria. Back then, they were idealists, beginner revolutionaries. ""You want your freedom, democracy, better healthcare, work, education,"" she said. ""We wanted dignity."" She loved her life before, but she is going to love it even more when the rebels win. Because they will win, she insists. Soon. ""Haven't we shown that?"" she asked.

"(CNN) -- If someone today argued for laws to legally bar interracial marriage that person would universally be labeled a bigot. But in 1967 when the U.S. Supreme Court in Loving v. Virginia struck down state laws prohibiting interracial marriage, 73% of Americans still supported them. Did that mean that more than 70% of Americans at that time were bigots? No. But there certainly came a time that you were one if you continued advocating for such discriminatory laws. Are we at that point yet with gay marriage? Is it fair to label a person a bigot simply for arguing that marriage should only be between a man and a woman? That's the first issue we discussed in Episode 2 of the new weekly CNN Radio podcast ""The Big Three,"" co-hosted by CNN opinion contributors Margaret Hoover, John Avlon and myself. Each week we look at three big issues making news. (For those catching up, our first episode is here.) To listen to this episode of ""The Big Three,"" click on the Soundcloud audio player on this page. Or you can find us on iTunes. In the new episode, here are the three topics we chose to discuss/fight/yell/joke about: . 1. Are you a bigot if you oppose gay marriage? Margaret Hoover raised the issue of whether we throw the word ""bigot"" around too quickly. She also posed the thought-provoking question: Would we would have called President Obama a bigot a year ago before he embraced marriage equality? My response is ""Yes"" with an asterisk. The asterisk being that I won't yet call anyone who opposes marriage equality a bigot simply because they believe marriage should be between a man and woman. (If you demonize gays, than I will call you one now.) But in time, that label will be accurate for those who continue to advocate discrimination. John Avlon, being the centrist that he is, made a very fair point that this is a process and it will take time. 2. Representative Michele Bachmann being investigated by the Office of Congressional Ethics.  Our own John Avlon broke this story in the Daily Beast on Monday. While I disagree with Bachmann on almost every issue, as a comedian I would hate to see her go. She is a less intellectual Sarah Palin, which equals comedy gold. But Margaret Hoover cites actual accomplishments by Bachmann in Congress as a member of the House Intelligence Committee. (I know, Bachmann serving on the Intelligence Committee is irony defined.) So will Bachmann be forced out of Congress, or will she remain in office much to the delight of a few people on the right -- and comedians everywhere? 3. Political Zombies. In the past, when politicians were caught in a scandal, they disappeared. But no longer. Today, our disgraced politicians are like ""Jason"" from the ""Friday the 13th ""movies. They just keep coming back. Former South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford -- who had been caught sneaking away from his state to meet his mistress in South America -- is back and a favorite to win the Republican nomination for Congress in a special election next week. And last week it was disclosed that former Congressman Anthony Weiner -- of Twitter underwear photo fame -- spent more than $100,000 on polls to explore running for mayor of New York City. Are we such a forgiving people that they will succeed, as Margaret Hoover believes? Or is it all part of our reality show mentality that rewards fame, as John and I argued? We hope you will check out this episode and let us know what you think. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","CNN Opinion podcast features ""Big Three"" issues, three commentators .

"Washington (CNN) -- The question of same-sex marriage went again before the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday in the last of two oral arguments this week in separate appeals. This session dealt with the Defense of Marriage Act, passed by Congress in 1996. It said, in part, that legally married same-sex couples cannot enjoy the range of financial and other benefits enjoyed by heterosexual married couples. Here are five things we learned from arguments in this case: . 1. Opening the gateways . A Supreme Court justice is sometimes like a fussy 8-year-old. She must eat her peas before any dessert. The dessert, of course, in the same sex-marriage cases are the constitutional ""equal protection questions"" -- the ones that get to the heart of defining what marriage is all about, the ones the entire nation wants answered. The second day of hearings: Majority of justices raise questions . But Wednesday's green vegetables are the gateway or the jurisdictional barriers that must first be confronted. The justices spent the first 50 minutes of their two-hour argument deciding whether they should even be there. Can House Republicans defend the Defense of Marriage Act when the president refuses to do so? It's no small matter. The executive branch, by tradition and statute, is charged with defending acts of Congress. The Obama Justice Department was doing just that when DOMA was being adjudicated by a federal judge in New York. Then an abrupt about-face. So one house of Congress decided it had to step in. ""Let's not confuse the issue of DOMA and the administration's decision that it was unconstitutional,"" House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, told CNN last week. ""It is not their role to decide what's constitutional. DOMA was a law that was passed by the House and Senate and signed into law by President Clinton. ""In our system of government, the administration doesn't get to decide what's constitutional -- the Supreme Court does. ... Our financing the lawsuit was to make sure the proper forum was used to make sure that we know what's constitutional and what isn't."" Read and listen to two days' of arguments for yourself . Chief Justice John Roberts at argument seemed to agree, suggesting the White House was trying to have it both ways -- believing DOMA was unconstitutional but continuing to defend it anyway. If Obama ""has made a determination that executing the law by enforcing the terms is unconstitutional, I don't see why he doesn't have the courage of his convictions and execute not only the statute, but do it consistent with his view of the Constitution, rather than saying -- oh, we'll wait until the Supreme Court tells us we have no choice."" Opinion: Chief justice reveals he's fed up with Obama . 2. The moment, courtesy of Kagan . Most hot-button Supreme Court cases have a ""moment,"" a comment or heated exchange that leaves onlookers with mouths agape and reporters scribbling furiously to mine the gold. Wednesday's memorable remarks came from Justice Elena Kagan, about 68 minutes into the arguments. Paul Clement, the attorney representing the House GOP, suggested that when DOMA was passed ""in 1996, something was happening"" -- states were considering whether to upset the ""traditional"" view of marriage and include gay and lesbian couples. ""In a sense,"" said Clement, ""it was forcing Congress to choose between its historic practice of deferring to the states and its historic practice of preferring uniformity."" Pause. Protesters pack Supreme Court grounds . ""I'm going to quote from the House Report here,"" said Kagan firmly, referring to the official recommendation from various congressional committees on the law's intent. ""That 'Congress decided to reflect an honor of collective moral judgment and to express moral disapproval of homosexuality.' Is that what happened in 1996?"" There were audible gasps in the courtroom. It deflated suggestions Congress merely wanted federal uniformity. ""When Congress targets a group that is not everybody's favorite group in the world, that we look at those cases -- even if they're not suspect -- with some rigor to say: Do we really think that Congress was doing this for uniformity reasons, or do we think that Congress' judgment was infected by dislike, by fear, by animus?"" she asked. ""And whether that sends up a pretty good red flag that that's what was going on."" It was a simple, direct and stunningly effective tactic by the so-called ""junior"" justice. She did not need to express her own personal judicial views on the law. She let Congress' own words speak for itself -- albeit in a 2013 political and social lens. New members to the bench have their own internal ""learning curve,"" where they try to navigate the complexities and rhythms of their new home -- oral argument, opinion writing and the personal dynamics between one's eight colleagues, all brilliant legal minds. But Kagan has seemed to pick things up quickly, especially remarkable since she's the only current member of the Supreme Court never to have been a judge before. She is confident at oral argument and can write opinions quickly. She and Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who preceded Kagan by a year, have found their footing. In their own way, they have become forces unto themselves. 16 braves and humorous signs on same-sex marriage . 3. Court's conservatives go tepid . As subdued as the more liberal justices were Tuesday over California's Proposition 8, the voter initiative banning same-sex marriage, so conservatives appeared Wednesday over DOMA. Roberts and Justice Antonin Scalia have been known to dominate especially high-profile debates, by turns passionate, clever and funny. Much of their energy was missing when the debate turned to congressional authority. Roberta Kaplan, attorney for key plaintiff Edith Windsor, made a bold statement in favor of gay rights, saying a ""sea change"" was happening in the country in favor of same-sex marriage. Such sweeping rhetoric from counsel is usually an invitation to a verbal smackdown from the justices. They like specifics, not speeches. Scalia had his chance for a tailor-made ""moment"" of his own but did not pounce. By the numbers: Same-sex marriage . ""Why are you so confident in that judgment?"" he asked mildly. ""How many states permit gay couples to marry?"" When told just nine, all Scalia could retort was, ""So there has been this sea change between now and 1996."" The conservative justices were not exactly sitting on their hands, but aside from Justice Clarence Thomas, who never speaks at argument, their energy was noticeably absent. 4. So is DOMA doomed? It's an almost reflexive attitude among many legal and political experts to downplay the influence Justice Anthony Kennedy possesses as the so-called swing vote among the divided conservative-liberal bench. Giving any one person in Washington that much credit just doesn't seem right, in the view of some. He certainly has done everything in his power to dismiss it, calling his ability to make or break a hot-button appeal a ""myth."" But it was hard to ignore remarks Kennedy made about an hour into the argument, which may give cheer to gay rights supporters. He pointed out there are about 1100 various federal provisions that legally married same-sex couples cannot use because of DOMA -- everything from taxes to family medical leave. ""Which in our society means that the federal government is intertwined with the citizens' day-to-day life, you are at real risk of running in conflict with what has always been thought to be the essence of the state police power, which is to regulate marriage, divorce, custody,"" he said. Woman at the center of the case . They were brief comments, delivered in the typical droll manner that is the low-key justice. He never dominates arguments, but when he talks, ears perk up. Even the justices on the bench were looking his way, absorbing the impact of what Kennedy was trying to convey. Any real power would be felt behind the red velvet curtains of the courtroom, where all important opinions are written. That is where the court derives its power and authority and where the views of this 76-year-old Californian must be respected. 5. Waiting for the final act . So what's next? In short, the public waits while the justices write. The members will meet privately later this week in a special conference room -- just the nine of them with no clerks, staff or reporters allowed. There, the court is expected to vote -- at least preliminarily -- on the two same-sex marriage appeals. Opinion writing will commence, endless drafts will be exchanged among chambers and suggestions for changes will come flooding. Bit by bit, the makings of legal opinion take shape. Justices are free to change their mind midstream -- and they do. Witness Roberts last year during the challenge to the health care reform law championed by Obama. Government sources confirm Roberts switched sides several weeks after an initial vote and was the controlling vote to uphold Obamacare. The internal drama will play out over the next three months, unseen by the public. The court's high profile will re-emerge when their ruling is issued, but the guessing game has already begun.

"Windsor, England (CNN) -- The body of expatriate Russian tycoon Boris Berezovsky was found in a bathroom at his British home with a ligature around his neck, a police officer testified at an inquest into his death Thursday. Berezovsky, 67, was found dead Saturday at a country estate south of London, triggering speculation about the fate of the business mogul known for his opposition to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Police have said that the death was consistent with hanging and that there were no signs of a struggle. An inquest by a coroner is standard procedure in cases of unnatural deaths in England. The short hearing at Windsor Guildhall opened Thursday morning with testimony from two witnesses. Read how Berezovsky was laid low by damning judgment . Detective Inspector Mark Bissel, of Thames Valley Police, said the body was found in the bathroom with ""a ligature around his neck"" and a piece of similar material around a shower rail, but he did not specify what the material was. The cause of death was consistent with hanging, with nothing to indicate a violent struggle or the involvement of a third person, he said. However, he added, third party involvement could not be completely ruled out as the investigation was continuing and the results of forensic examinations were not yet in. The test results, including toxicology reports, could take several weeks to come, Bissel said. The mansion where Berezovsky's body was found is still under police guard, and the search for evidence is expected to continue for the next few days, he said. Coroner's officer Janine Prunty said the name of the deceased was Platon Elenin, formerly Boris Abramovich Berezovsky, who was born in Moscow in January 1946. He had legally changed his name in 2003. His body was formally identified by his daughter Elizaveta Berezovskaya on Tuesday. Berezovsky's body was discovered Saturday afternoon by an employee, who called the emergency services, the inquest heard. The tycoon was last seen alive at 9:05 p.m. the day before by the same employee. The inquest was then adjourned to allow authorities to gather more evidence. The date for it to reopen has not yet been set. 'Extraordinary' man . The family of Berezovsky's second wife, Galina Besharova, released a tribute to him Wednesday through Thames Valley Police. Berezovsky had two children from this marriage, a son and a daughter, Anastasia, who wrote the tribute on behalf of her family. ""My father was not the typical parent, nothing about him was ordinary,"" she wrote. ""He has taught me many things about this world. ""He has taught me to never stop fighting for what one believes in no matter what the costs may be. I doubt anyone could have met a man with a stronger presence, or with charm that was more overwhelming than the one my father possessed. ""There aren't enough words in any language that can somehow express everything that he was and everything he will continue to be. The only word that comes close is extraordinary.""

"(CNN) -- Facebook is holding an Android-related press event next week and already the Internet is in a tizzy. Could this be the rumored, mythical, magical Facebook phone? The truth is, I don't know. For nearly 18 months, rumors of a Facebook phone — developed by HTC and running a customized version of Android — have continued to persist. And for nearly 18 months, Facebook has publicly denied its interest in building its own phone. Last September at TechCrunch Disrupt, Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg went on at length about why a Facebook phone wasn't right for the company. He said: . ""Let's say we build a phone. We're not, but if we did, we could maybe get 10 to 20 million people to use it ... It doesn't move the needle for us."" ""The strategy we have is different from every other tech company [like Apple] that's building their own hardware system — we're going in the opposite direction.."" Of course, if a Facebook phone is coming, this wouldn't be the first time that a CEO has said one thing publicly while planning on doing exactly the opposite. At Apple, Steve Jobs was famous for denouncing a product (iPod video) or industry (mobile phones), only to enter that same industry or create that same product later. So let's assume that a Facebook phone is coming and that it will run some sort of highly-customized version of Android. Does a Facebook phone even make sense anymore, especially given the current market realities and competition in the mobile space? I say no. The timing for a phone is no longer right . When the rumors of a Facebook phone first started to spread, the idea made sense — at least from a business perspective. Facebook was not yet a public company and it was desperately trying to transition into being a mobile-first company. A phone made sense, in part, because the native mobile app experience was so poor. Not only were the old versions of Facebook for Android and iOS slow and lacking in feature parity with the website, the company hadn't started to figure out a way to monetize the apps themselves and offer mobile ad units to buyers. At the same time, while Android was dominating the mobile landscape from a global perspective, Samsung hadn't solidified its role as the defacto face of the platform. Plus, most phones running Android in 2011 and into 2012 were running Android 2.3 Gingerbread. A customized version of Android built around Facebook was appealing, because Android itself was still lacking in polish and with some core functionality. That's no longer the case. With every release, Android gets better looking and better performing. Android 4.2 Jelly Bean is its best yet and we're expecting to see an even newer version at Google I/O in May. Moreover, the face of Android is no longer Google, it's Samsung. The Galaxy brand is tremendously powerful, with the Galaxy S III alone selling over 50 million units since June. Plus, Facebook is improving on the mobile front. Its mobile apps are native now and the company has mobile ad units and is making changes to its core products — such as the News Feed — to be mobile first and properly monetized. The market for third place Is crowded . Facebook has over a billion users on the desktop, but its phone ecosystem won't pop up over night. Even if it uses Android as a base, one has to assume that if Facebook makes a phone, it will want to have more control than allowed as part of Google's Open Handset Alliance. For better or worse, that would mean that it would need to be its own platform. Apple and Android proper make up the vast majority of the smartphone space. The battle for third place isn't just being fought by Windows Phone and BlackBerry 10; it's also facing competition from the smaller mobile OS's such as Tizen, Ubuntu and Firefox OS. Those companies are already making inroads in emerging markets, where it's easier to disrupt the iOS/Android duopoly. Facebook wouldn't just be competing with iOS and Google's version of Android — it would also be competing with carriers to actually give the phone a chance. Microsoft — a company with a much longer and stronger history in mobile — has struggled to gain traction with carriers. Only now, after more than two years of work, is the company outselling iOS in a few select markets. If Facebook thinks it can just waltz in and get carriers to agree to sell its phone, it's mistaken. Companies such as Huawei and ZTE — companies that sell more phones than HTC, I might add — struggle to get major U.S. carriers to pick up their products, and those products run Android proper. Facebook will have a hard time getting carriers not only to agree to carry a Facebook phone, but to promote it. Right now, when a user walks into a store, she has to choose from among a few different iPhone models, a countless array of Android devices, some Windows Phone 8 models and even the BlackBerry Z10. Plus, even if Facebook does make its own phone, it's not as if the company can ignore other platforms. The company has to be ubiquitous and offer its apps and services to everyone. Does it really make sense for Facebook to invest the time and resources in further fragmenting the phone space, when it still has to support the two big players anyway? What does make sense: A Facebook app store for Android . While I'm not convinced that a phone in any sense makes sense for Facebook, it's clear that Facebook does need to get its hooks deeper into mobile. For a Facebook phone to be worthwhile — Zuckerberg is right — it can't be just 10 or 20 million, it has to have massive scale. Facebook will have a hard time achieving that scale with its own phone and OS. But that doesn't mean the company couldn't still achieve that sort of scale by going another route. Rather than building a phone and customizing its own version of Android to fit its needs, Facebook should take some cues from Amazon and consider building its own Facebook app store that runs on Android devices. By app store — I don't just mean a copy of Google Play or a place for developers to offer their apps on yet another store — I mean a way for Facebook to offer mobile developers a way to build apps that interact and interface with Facebook on a deeper level. These apps could interface with the native Facebook interface more fluidly — and maybe even let developers bring their traditional Facebook apps to Android in a way that doesn't require the same commitment as building a traditional Android app. Plus, an app store would be a good market test to see if the demand for a Facebook phone actually exists. After all, it would be a lot easier to launch a phone with a slew of supported mobile apps and deep integration. Look, at one point, a Facebook phone might have made sense. In today's climate and crowded mobile market, that's no longer the case. This commentary reflects the opinions of the author and not necessarily those of Mashable or CNN. © 2013 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- Up to 11,200 peacekeeping troops could maintain stability in Mali under a new U.N. proposal. And up to 1,440 police could also participate in a U.N.-led mission there, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in a report to the U.N. Security Council released Tuesday. Under the proposal, the West African multinational force currently in Mali would eventually become part of the U.N. stabilizing mission. ""The proposed authorized military strength of 11,200, based on seven mobile infantry battalions and a reserve battalion with enablers for the geographic and threat environments, provides for a security presence in the major population areas assessed to be at high risk,"" the report said. France confirms death of senior Islamist militant in Mali . The peacekeeping troops proposal was one of two options Ban floated in the report. Under the other option, the United Nations would focus on political and development activities there. French and allied forces, including Malian and Chadian troops, have made significant inroads in recent weeks combating Islamist extremist fighters in Mali. But fighting continues in the remote northeastern part of the West African nation. French involvement in the conflict began on January 11, the day after militants said they had seized the city of Konna, east of Diabaly in central Mali, and were poised to advance south toward Bamako, the capital. In total, 4,000 French soldiers are deployed in Mali, according to the French Defense Ministry website, alongside 6,300 troops from Chad and the African-led International Support Mission to Mali. French officials have said the country will start withdrawing its troops from Mali next month. France using DNA to identify Islamists killed in Africa .

"Decatur, Texas (CNN) -- Colorado authorities are working to determine whether a high-speed chase Thursday involving a man who shot repeatedly at law enforcement officers in Texas is related to this week's shooting death of Tom Clements, Colorado's prison chief. The chase and crash occurred in north Texas, about 700 miles from where Clements was killed Tuesday night. It began around 11 a.m. CT (noon ET) in Montague County, where the driver of a black Cadillac shot at a law enforcement officer who had pulled him over in a traffic stop, said Wise County, Texas, Sheriff David Walker. Two bullets struck the Montague County deputy, who was wearing a bulletproof vest, in the chest and another grazed his head before he managed to call in help, said the sheriff. He is in serious condition at a Dallas-Fort Worth area hospital. This incident was followed by a high-speed chase that ended around 30 miles away in Decatur, Texas. That's where city police tried to pull him over, and the Cadillac's driver fled and started shooting at officers. The suspect shot one patrol vehicle and that of Decatur police Chief Rex Hoskins, whose car was parked in the median. ""I would say he was running about 100 mph, and he had his left arm out the window and he was just shooting,"" Hoskins said. Soon after that, the man turned his Cadillac onto another road and slammed into an 18-wheel truck, according to Walker. Even with the front of his car crushed, the suspect -- who has not been publicly identified -- got out and resumed shooting. He did not shoot any responding officers in the Wise County exchange, but was shot himself. After being kept alive on machines for some time, the suspect died Thursday evening, according to Walker. Colorado media and national wire services identified the man killed in the Texas chase and shooting as Evan Ebel, a 28-year-old parolee in the Denver metropolitan area. On Thursday night, the El Paso County Sheriff's Office issued a statement mentioning Evan Spencer Ebel had been named in a Denver Post report citing unnamed federal and state authorities, then sharply criticized such an anonymous disclosure as ""disappointing"" and saying it ""undermines an active investigation and can have a negative impact on any future prosecution."" CNN has not been able to independently confirm the identity of the man killed in Texas. The Cadillac had two different Colorado license plates -- one on the front and the other on the back -- said Hoskins. A law enforcement official said Thursday that authorities are ""are taking a strong look"" at whether Thursday's incident and Clements' shooting are linked. ""Colorado is sending ... investigators that are working on that case and other homicide cases in the Colorado area,"" Walker said. Denver police, noting that they've been working closely with colleagues in nearby Golden, tweeted Thursday evening there is ""a strong connection with the Texas case"" and another Colorado homicide and that its investigators are heading to Texas. Golden police report the two police departments are together investigating the March 17 shooting death of a 27-year-old pizza delivery man. Nathan Collin Leon disappeared from work in Denver and was found dead in Golden. Saudi national's case considered in probe . The Texas incident comes the same day that Colorado investigators said they were looking closely at one criminal of the thousands that Clements' oversaw in the state's prison system -- a Saudi national named Homaidan al-Turki. El Paso County, Colorado, Undersheriff Paula Presley on Thursday acknowledged the media speculation over al-Turki, who was convicted of sexually assaulting his housemaid at his Aurora, Colorado, home seven years ago. Earlier this month, Clements denied al-Turki's request to serve the remainder of his Colorado prison sentence in Saudi Arabia, records show. Investigators, she said, are still trying to determine whether ""there may have been some motivation or legitimate threat"" related to al-Turki's case, adding that ""we have not identified that specifically as a threat."" Al-Turki, now at the Limon Correctional Facility, was sentenced to 20 years to life in prison after being convicted on a dozen counts of sexual contact, theft, extortion and false imprisonment in 2006, a state document shows. Prosecutors said he enslaved his Indonesian maid for several years. At the request of the U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Colorado Attorney General John Suthers traveled to Riyadh in 2006 to meet with King Abdullah, other Saudi officials and the al-Turki family to discuss the case. Clements explained in a March 11 letter to al-Turki that he was turning down his transfer request because al-Turki had refused to go through sex offender treatment, as required by law. ""To date you have reportedly declined due to religious reasons/conflicts with your Islamic faith,"" Clements wrote. The letter also notes that on February 25, 2011, al-Turki's sentence was reduced to six years to life. Read the full letter . CNN has not received a response to its requests for comment from al-Turki's lawyers. In light of the renewed attention on his case, al-Turki was removed this week from the rest of his prison's population, according to the state's department of corrections. Late prisons chief described as 'amazing man' Clements had been chief of Colorado's prison system for a little over two years. He took the job in January 2011 after working for 31 years as part of Missouri's Department of Corrections. In his time in Colorado, he'd made a big impression. ""He was an amazing man, an amazing man,"" Alison Morgan, spokeswoman for Colorado's Department of Corrections, said Thursday. ""An inspirational leader."" He was killed around 8:45 p.m. MT (10:45 p.m. ET) Tuesday, as he answered the door of his Monument, Colorado, home. Since then, investigators had said they knew very little about who might have pulled the trigger. Some witnesses, though, said they saw a man driving a vehicle -- possibly a Lincoln Continental or a two-door Cadillac -- away from the neighborhood a short time after the shooting. Others reported seeing a black, boxy vehicle with its engine running but no one inside on Clements' street. Asked Thursday whether the prison chief's killing may have been a professional hit, Presley from the El Paso County, Colorado, Sheriff's Office said, ""We don't have any specific information that would lead us to that."" The central Colorado county sheriff office's major crimes unit has received more than 100 solid tips about the incident, including a growing number of witnesses describing a black car then in the area. Meanwhile, the mourning continues for Clements. His funeral will be held Sunday, Gov. John Hickenlooper's office said, and he'll be remembered at a public memorial service in Colorado Springs the next day. Read the latest news on CNN.com .

"New York (CNN) -- Donald Trump is seeking $400,000 in damages from a Brooklyn man over four websites that use the real estate mogul's name and brand. Attorneys representing Trump filed a countersuit against J. Taikwok Yung, 33, at the U.S. District Court in Brooklyn on Thursday, seeking damages for ""federal cybersquatting."" That's defined by the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act as ""the registration as domain names of well-known trademarks by nontrademark holders who then try to sell the names back to the trademark owners."" Trump ""has spent his career establishing his famous name and brand and is not going to sit by idly and allow a pathetic squatter like Mr. Yung to infringe on his well-established rights."" Alexis Robinson, intellectual property counsel for the Trump Organization, wrote in an e-mail to CNN. Yung, a self-described ""domainer,"" acquired four Trump-related domain names, including trumpmumbai.com and trumpindia.com, in 2007, the year the Trump organization announced plans to build Trump-branded hotels and condominiums in Mumbai and Bangalore, India. In 2011, Yung filed a complaint seeking to keep the domain names, citing fair use and First Amendment rights, after actions filed by the Trump Organization demanded he hand the websites over to Trump. Yung used the websites to provide commentary, often disparaging, about Trump and his television shows ""The Apprentice"" and ""The Celebrity Apprentice."" A disclaimer appeared on the main page of the websites stating that the material posted had not been approved by the Trump Organization. All four websites were taken down Saturday. Yung describes himself as a former U.S. Marine and said he hoped to educate and interest other Marines about ""the opportunities available on the Internet"" and to inform them ""against corporate evils that attempt to harvest their sacrifices and financial security in the name of corporate, Wall Street, and real estate profit,"" the 2011 complaint said. Yung maintained that he never contacted the Trump Organization about selling the domain names for profit, he wrote in the complaint. He also wrote specifically about Trump, criticizing Trump and his legal undertakings. ""Donald Trump is known worldwide to butcher the legal system with frivolous complaints as a vehicle to harass people,"" Yung wrote in the complaint. Yung has been representing himself. He did not respond to CNN's requests for comment. ""Yung is as brazen and unrepentant a cybersquatter as one might find,"" wrote Trump's attorneys in a memorandum filed with the court Thursday. ""By his own admission, Yung seeks to acquire 'interesting and high-value domain names and park them initially with domain parking service providers and/or build the website, if feasible, with interesting content,'"" the memorandum stated. The countersuit filed Thursday seeks the maximum damages allowable -- $100,000 for each of the four Trump-related domain names. Yung also holds nearly 200 other domain names, including barclayscapitallehman.com, goldmansachsgroup.com, milanvogue.com and hulufriend.com. In 2009, Yung acquired the domains bofaml.com and mlbofa.com on the same day that Bank of America Corp. and Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. announced their merger, resulting in similar legal action.

"(CNN) -- On March 18, a Congolese warlord known as Bosco ""the Terminator"" Ntaganda surrendered to the U.S. Embassy in Rwanda. Notorious for his alleged butchering of communities, including a 2008 massacre in which 150 people were killed by machetes, clubs and bullets, Ntaganda will likely face trial at the International Criminal Court for war crimes seven years after his indictment. On a recent trip to eastern Congo, I met Patrick, a 25-year-old charcoal maker who had survived two attacks allegedly led by Ntaganda. Four months ago, working on a hot afternoon just south of the equator in Kibumba in eastern Congo, it seemed like a normal day for Patrick. A week before, his wife had given birth to a baby boy, Janvier. Then suddenly, Patrick heard a ""boom!"" And he ran home as quickly as he could. Patrick's village had just been attacked by the M23 rebel group co-commanded by Ntaganda. For Patrick, it was the second time he had been displaced in four years by an armed group led by Ntaganda. Panting, he arrived back home, but his wife and newborn were nowhere to be found. ""Then I heard the bombs land, and I had to flee,"" he told me in the displacement camp where he now struggles to survive on one meal per day. Months later, Patrick had still been unable to find his family in the camps, which now include more than 2 million people. ""My children used to crawl onto my lap, eat little candies I would buy them and make me laugh. Now I can't go far to look for them, as I'm afraid I'll be abducted by rebels. I'm told my house has been burned down. It's so tough for me. I don't know where they are. ..."" The Terminator's surrender has sparked jubilation in eastern Congo after years of suffering under his ruthless rule, during which he also amassed millions of dollars through a conflict minerals smuggling ring. But will this single event create lasting change for the people of eastern Congo who have suffered under repeated cycles of conflict for 18 years? The answer hangs on three policy choices that must be made in the coming weeks. First, will war criminals be integrated back into the Democratic Republic of Congo's army? The M23 rebel group that Ntaganda co-led is full of officers with extremely poor human rights records of mass murders, child soldier recruitment and sexual violence. Several of them are close to signing a peace deal to rejoin the Congolese army in talks brokered by one of the rebel group's alleged backers, Uganda. Previous peace deals that integrated war criminals into Congo's army, including Ntaganda, reignited conflict soon thereafter as the warlords again behaved lawlessly. To stop this, newly appointed U.N. envoy Mary Robinson should immediately insist that any reintegration deals should be only for rank-and-file troops, not commanders most responsible for atrocities. To support this, the International Criminal Court should investigate and indict the commanders of M23 leaders and other armed groups most responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity, and the Congolese justice system should prosecute other mutineers. Second, will there be a peace process with strong international backing? After years of failed peace agreements, there is finally a chance to address the underlying interests of Rwanda, Congo and Uganda that have fueled conflict in eastern Congo. This is possible now because of the strong new international pressure against external support to rebel groups, the removal of Ntaganda, the lowered profitability of the trade in conflict minerals and the International Monetary Fund's pressure on Congo to enact governance reforms. Robinson should start negotiations that would subsume the Kampala talks, and the Obama administration should follow the U.N. lead in appointing a senior-level envoy to the peace process and ensure that regional economic integration and security issues are brought to the fore of the process. Third, will the international community vigorously support real governance reform in Congo? The U.S. and U.N. envoys should proactively back a root-and-branch Congolese reform process to address critical issues that undergird the conflict, from decentralization to army reform. The process should include an impartially facilitated national dialogue that allows Congolese civil society, including women leaders, to have a real voice at the table. When asked this year what could be done to end the war, Patrick said, ""Please tell President Obama to arrest Bosco, (M23 commander) Sultani Makenga and the ringleaders. If they're not arrested, they'll continue the war, and my life will always be on the run."" At least one of these warlords is now in custody, but there will be no end to the war until the international community robustly backs a lasting peace and reform process that includes accountability for the worst war criminals. It is time to give Patrick a chance to play with his children again and end this cyclical war once and for all.

"(CNN) -- The most senior surviving Khmer Rouge leader, Nuon Chea, has been declared fit for trial by a United Nations-backed court in Cambodia, the agency said Friday. Nuon, the right-hand man to late leader Pol Pot and a former Cambodian prime minister, is reportedly 86 years old and is accused of murder and torture. He waived his right to be present in court Friday because of health reasons, including heart disease, the United Nations said. Earlier this month, former Khmer Rouge foreign minister Ieng Sary died in Phnom Penh at age 87, said the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, the U.N.-backed court. He was Pol Pot's brother-in-law and escaped judgment for war crimes. The communist Khmer Rouge regime under Pol Pot was blamed for the deaths of some 1.7 million people through torture, execution, hard labor and starvation from 1975 to 1979.","Most senior surviving Khmer Rouge leader has been declared fit for trial .

"(CNN) -- Rory McIlroy has apologized after putting his need for more competitive golf action ahead of a planned humanitarian visit to Haiti next week -- and said his caddy had played a big part in the decision. The world No. 2 was due to visit Haiti on Monday and Tuesday in his role as a UNICEF ambassador following the end of this weekend's PGA Tour event in Houston. He first went to the Caribbean country in 2011 to meet people affected by the devastating earthquake the previous year. However, following his second round at the Houston Open the two-time major winner decided that he would add the Texas Open to his schedule in order to hav more time on the course ahead of the Masters at Augusta starting April 11. ""Unfortunately, I have had to postpone my planned trip to Haiti, with UNICEF, due to a change in my playing commitments,"" the 23-year-old said in a statement issued on his behalf by UNICEF Ireland. Leaderboard: Follow the final round at Houston . ""I am a strong supporter of UNICEF's work and I was privileged to be given the opportunity to visit Haiti, with UNICEF, nearly two years ago. We are currently looking at dates to reschedule my trip and I look forward to visiting Haiti very soon.""Â . McIlroy has struggled to repeat his dominance of last season, when he topped both the U.S. and European Tour money lists and won his second major at the PGA Championship in August. After the long-awaited news of his reported $250 million switch to Nike equipment was finally confirmed, he missed the cut in Abu Dhabi in January and was knocked out in the first round of the WGC Matchplay in Arizona in February. Later that month, he controversially walked off the course at the Honda Classic in Florida, saying both that his wisdom tooth was causing pain and that he was frustrated by a flaw in his swing. His decision to miss last week's Arnold Palmer Invitational raised eyebrows given his lack of tournament golf, and Tiger Woods' victory allowed the 14-time major winner to regain the world No. 1 spot from his young rival. McIlroy made the cut at Redstone, but three bogeys in his last six holes saw him fade to a tie for 48th after Saturday's third round -- which left him nine shots behind leaders Bill Haas and Stewart Cink. After his one-under-par 71, McIlroy explained that his caddy J.P. Fitzgerald had convinced him that he needed extra tournament play in San Antonio next week. ""(It was) something I hadn't thought about until basically after I finished yesterday,"" McIlroy said on the PGA Tour website Saturday. ""J.P. was the one that mentioned it to me. He said, 'If you just play a few more rounds, I think you're going to be ready.' I didn't really think about it too much and sat down, had some lunch, started to think about it and I texted him and said, 'I don't think this is a bad idea.' ""Probably took me an hour or two to sort of think about it and decide about.'' McIlroy has not had much tournament play this year, and he acknowledged that he is feeling ""rusty."" ""I just feel like I'm playing well, I'm hitting the ball well. Everything feels good,"" he said. ""It's just about playing a bit more competitive course and getting a little sharper. I feel a little rusty out there at times. I think the more rounds I play, the better it will be for me going into Augusta."" Cink is looking for his first victory since the 2009 British Open, but he and Haas were just one shot ahead of a group of four players -- and another nine were a stroke further back, including former major winners Louis Oosthuizen, Angel Cabrera and Keegan Bradley plus ex-world No. 1 Lee Westwood. Three-time Masters winner Phil Mickelson was five shots adrift, having moved up the leaderboard with a 67 as he seeks his second Houston victory.","McIlroy pulls out of planned trip to Haiti to play more tournament golf ahead of the Masters .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- The United States deployed stealth fighter jets to South Korea on Sunday as part of ongoing joint military exercises between the two countries, a senior U.S. defense official said. The F-22 Raptors were sent to the main U.S. Air Force Base in South Korea amid spiking tensions on the Korean peninsula. The U.S. military command in South Korea said they were deployed to support air drills as part of the annual Foal Eagle training exercises, which are carried out in accordance with the armistice that put an end to armed hostilities in 1953. North Korea has been ramping up its rhetoric and military show of force in response to the annual joint military exercises, declaring the armistice invalid on March 11, 10 days after Foal Eagle began. It is something Pyongyang has done before during heightened tensions. North Korea's threat: Five things to know . The United States' participation in Foal Eagle is intended to demonstrate the country's ""commitment to stability and security in the Asia-Pacific Region,"" the U.S. military command in South Korea said in a statement that also urged North Korea to tone down its rhetoric. ""The (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) will achieve nothing by threats or provocations, which will only further isolate North Korea and undermine international efforts to ensure peace and stability in Northeast Asia,"" the statement said. ""The North Korean leadership is urged to heed President Obama's call to choose the path of peace and come into compliance with its international obligations."" North Korea's hot rhetoric . The deployment follows fresh insults over the weekend from Pyongyang's propaganda machine comparing the U.S. mainland with a ""boiled pumpkin,"" unable to endure an attack from a foreign foe, the state-run Korean Central News Agency reported. North Korea, on the other hand, could withstand an offensive from the outside, the report said, thanks to shelters that the government had built around the country. But the Pentagon and the South Korean government have said it's nothing new. ""We have no indications at this point that it's anything more than warmongering rhetoric,"" a senior U.S. Defense Department official said late Friday. The official was not authorized to speak to the media and asked not to be named. The National Security Council, which advises the U.S. president on matters of war, struck a similar chord, saying Washington finds North Korea's statements ""unconstructive"" and is taking the threats seriously. ""But, we would also note that North Korea has a long history of bellicose rhetoric and threats, and today's announcement follows that familiar pattern,"" said Caitlin Hayden, a spokeswoman for the security council. The United States will continue to update its capabilities against any military threat from the North, which includes plans to deploy missile defense systems. No, North Korea can't hit Hawaii . In an added slap, North Korea has declared that it had entered a ""state of war"" with neighboring South Korea, according to a report Saturday from KCNA. ""The condition, which was neither war nor peace, has ended,"" North Korea's government said in a special statement carried by KCNA. Saturday's reports also asserted any conflict ""will not be limited to a local war, but develop into an all-out war, a nuclear war."" South Korean President Park Geun-hye on Monday issued a warning of her own to Pyongyang. ""If there is any provocation against South Korea and its people, there should be a strong response in initial combat without any political considerations,"" she said in a meeting with senior defense and security officials, according to her office. Analysis: Just what is Kim Jong Un up to? The South: It's not new . South Korea has not, however, treated its neighbor's latest threat as imminent danger. Seoul noted scores of its personnel had entered the Kaesong Industrial Complex -- a joint economic cooperation zone between the two Koreas situated on the North's side of the border -- on Saturday morning. Hundreds more were set to join them later in the day, seeming to suggest both sides were going about business as usual. The South's officials said that North's threats to shut down the complex earlier Saturday were part of the North's ""measures of putting military alert to highest level,"" but the South was taking the North's words ""seriously,"" the South Korean Unification Ministry Press Office said. The threats aren't ""beneficial"" to the development of the economic zone, the South's ministry said. Currently, 310 people work in the industrial complex, the ministry said. However, the South hasn't detected any ""irregular trend"" in the zone, the ministry said. Pyongyang's declaration it was readying its missiles also did not seem to worry officials in the South. ""The announcement made by North Korea is not a new threat, but part of follow-up measures after North Korea's supreme command's statement that it will enter the highest military alert"" on Tuesday, South Korea's Unification Ministry said in a statement. Threats of annihilation normal for South Koreans . Map appears to show U.S. targets . A day earlier, the same official North Korean news agency reported its leader Kim Jong Un had approved a plan to prepare standby rockets to hit U.S. targets in the Pacific, including in Hawaii, Guam, and South Korea. Behind North Korea's heated words about missile strikes, one analyst said, there might not be much mettle. ""Unless there has been a miraculous turnaround among North Korea's strategic forces, there is little to no chance that it could successfully land a missile on Guam, Hawaii or anywhere else outside the Korean Peninsula that U.S. forces may be stationed,"" James Hardy, Asia-Pacific editor of IHS Jane's Defense Weekly, wrote in an opinion column published Thursday on CNN.com. Behind the veil: A rare look at life in North Korea . U.S. official: We're 'committed ... to peace' U.S. defense officials said Friday that the North's bantering is destructive. ""This is troubling rhetoric that disrupts the prospects for peace on the Peninsula,"" the senior official said. Some observers have suggested that Washington is adding to tensions in the region by drawing attention to its displays of military strength on North Korea's doorstep, such as the flights by the B-2 stealth bombers. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel argued against that assertion Thursday. ""We, the United States and South Korea, have not been involved in provocating anything,"" he said. ""We, over the years, have been engaged with South Korea on joint exercises. The B-2 flight was part of that."" Washington and its allies ""are committed to a pathway to peace,"" Hagel said. ""And the North Koreans seem to be headed in a different direction here."" Opinion: Why North Korea regime is scary . Pyongyang's allies irked . The tense situation has irritated North Korea's traditional allies, China and Russia, drawing regular calls for restraint on all sides in recent weeks. Saturday, the Kremlin repeated this admonition. ""Moscow expects all parties to exercise as much responsibility and restraint as possible in light of North Korea's latest statements,"" the Russian foreign ministry said according to Russian state broadcaster Russia Today. China, which has expressed frustration over Pyongyang's latest nuclear test, also called for calm. ""We hope relevant parties can work together to turn around the tense situation in the region,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said Friday, describing peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula as ""a joint responsibility."" Sweden's Foreign Minister Carl Bildt noted Saturday that ""Beijing likely to try to calm things down,"" he said on his Twitter account. ""But the Pyongyang regime is the most militarised, the most authoritarian and the most closed in the world,"" Bildt tweeted. U.S. officials concerned about North Korea's 'ratcheting up of rhetoric' Tensions have been rising for months . Tensions escalated on the Korean Peninsula after the North carried out a long-range rocket launch in December and an underground nuclear test last month, prompting the U.N. Security Council to step up sanctions on the secretive government. Pyongyang has expressed fury about the sanctions and the annual U.S.-South Korean military exercises, due to continue until the end of April. The deteriorating relations have killed hopes of reviving multilateral talks over North Korea's nuclear program for the foreseeable future. Indeed, Pyongyang has declared that the subject is no longer up for discussion. Korean nightmare: Experts ponder potential conflict .

"London (CNN) -- No British politician has ever aroused admiration and respect like Margaret Thatcher. But none has inspired the same level of fear and animosity. To her fans she was the Conservative warrior-queen who vanquished both the ""enemy within"" -- the striking Yorkshire coal miners led by Arthur Scargill -- and the enemy without -- Gen. Galtieri's Argentine force that invaded the Falkland Islands in 1982. She was the country's only female prime minister, and the first to win three general elections in a row. OBITUARY: Britain's divisive ""Iron Lady"" dead at 87 . In Parliament, Thatcher brushed aside all dissenting voices, and for a decade from 1979 she was indomitable. While the left feuded over how best to fight her government's right-wing policies of austerity, privatization and laws to curb the labor unions, the only opposition with any bite came from comedians, satirists and musicians, all of whom pilloried the ""Iron Lady"" and her ministers with wit, flare and fury. The polarized society that Britain became was encapsulated by the song ""Ghost Town,"" by ska revivalists The Specials, the haunting soundtrack of 1981 as riots erupted in London, Birmingham, Liverpool and Leeds. With a haunting melody, the song recounted how ""This town's becoming like a ghost town / Government leaving the youth on the shelf."" The Coventry-based band's songwriter Jerry Dammers said the No. 1 single was inspired by a loathing of Thatcher. ""That song was our political reflection on the situation in the 1980s, which wasn't good, and that Thatcher's own policies had helped create. ""I'm proud to have put out songs opposed to her as she changed our country for the worse. Britain is no longer self-sufficient and we don't pay our way in the world anymore. ""A lot of musicians were happy to put their opinions into song, for example us, Elvis Costello and The Beat, a trend that hasn't happened since the time of Thatcher."" ROBIN OAKLEY: Many Britons never identified with Thatcher . Many other memorable protest songs followed: Some, like ""Ghost Town"" and The Jam's ""Town Called Malice,"" were directly political in voicing opposition to the austerity and mass unemployment of the era; others articulated a deep visceral hatred of the woman herself, as in Elvis Costello's ""Stamp the Dirt Down"" or ""Margaret on the Guillotine"" by Morrissey. One music writer said Thatcher inspired so many angry young songwriters because she appeared to go out of her way to stir up confrontation. ""She was such an oppositional figure, singling out certain enemies, for example the Argentine junta, unions, travelers, people on benefits, the left wing in general,"" said Dorian Lynskey, author of ""33 Revolutions Per Minute: A History of Protest Songs."" ""She was unflinching and vicious in her attacks on them. There was a sense she was conducting a war on certain sections of society. She referred to the miners as 'the enemy within.' This just was not the way politicians talk about their citizens. (Current UK Prime Minister) David Cameron does not do that; Tories before Thatcher did not do that. That aspect enraged people because they felt she was treating them with rhetorical and political violence. That encouraged them to respond with their own violence."" WORLD REACTION: Kissinger calls Thatcher a ""great lady"" The songs that spewed from this disgust at Thatcher's policies and personality formed a strand of the decade's best music, according to Lynskey, who says all the best music has been political in some way. ""If you look at a list of the greatest songs ever, many of these will be political. 'Strange Fruit,' (performed most famously by Billie Holiday) 'Ohio,' (Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young) 'For What It's Worth,' (Buffalo Springfield) 'What's Going On, (Marvin Gaye) 'Born In the USA,' (Bruce Springsteen) 'Sign O' the Times' (Prince) -- all were successful songs, but intensely political at the same time."" Thatcher was eventually deposed in 1990 by her fellow Conservatives in Parliament, not musicians, but that, according to Lynskey, misses the point of artistic expression: Just as Picasso's ""Guernica,"" portraying the 1937 bombing of a Spanish Basque town by German and Italian warplanes, did not end the Spanish Civil War, it was important in expressing outrage and making a political point. ""Art can make people angry, can inform or inspire them. It can make them feel they're not alone. It can make them feel better when they're low."" Thatcher made an impression on pop culture . In other fields, a new era of fashion, film, TV programs, style magazines and nightclubs was also flowing out of the punk rebellion of the previous decade. ""There were just so many exciting things going on then,"" Lynskey recalled. Whether any of this artistic explosion was directly due to the Thatcher effect is debatable -- especially in light of her reported aversion to the arts -- but one commentator for a left-leaning publication believes that her philosophy was certainly echoed in the youth culture of the day, whether the hip young gunslingers agreed with her divisive politics or not. ""The punks and their fellow-travellers had an anti-establishment, DIY, can-do attitude,"" wrote Jason Cowley in the New Statesman. ""The feeling was one of fundamental discontinuity with the past. They shared with the Thatcherites an overwhelming desire to break from the established order, and to make it all new, as the modernists had."" The fashion world also joined the protests against the Conservative government's policies. At one party in Downing Street in 1983, Katherine Hamnett wore a T-shirt bearing the message: ""58% don't want Pershing"" (referring to an opinion poll showing public opposition to the deployment of U.S. nuclear-capable missiles to the UK). Hamnett recalls three decades later how fellow designer Jasper Conran tried to dissuade her from attending the official reception. ""He said, 'Why should we have a glass of wine with that murderess?' But I thought on impulse it was quite a good photo opportunity, so we knocked up a T-shirt that afternoon and I wore it to the party. Opinion: Why Britain needs another Thatcher . ""Thatcher wasn't very happy and was quite rude. She told me: 'We don't have Pershing here, we have cruise (missiles). I think you've got the wrong party.' I thought this was rather rude because she invited me in the first place. I stayed at the party though!"" Hamnett agrees that the arts did blossom during that era, but believes it had little to do with the ""destructive"" politician herself. ""She was appalling,"" said Hamnett. ""She did nothing for the arts. Thatcher used to design her own frumpy clothes. I don't know if she would have made a better fashion designer than a prime minister, but it wouldn't have been hard. ""We did well in the '80s. We produced some of the best designers in the world, because of our clothing culture and the fact we're more liberal with our children. They can go to school in 'Red Indian' outfits if they want. We did produce good designers, regardless of Thatcher."" Humor was another field that boomed in direct response to Thatcher. So-called ""alternative comedians"" on TV and in clubs took a sharp left turn away from the routines of their more reactionary predecessors, with many of the newcomers poking fun at the po-faced prime minister. The most biting of all was ""Spitting Image,"" a satirical puppet show broadcast on Sunday evenings on ITV from 1984 until 1996 that pilloried public figures, especially Thatcher, whom the program often portrayed as an insane megalomaniac. Roger Law, who with Peter Fluck designed the caricature puppets for the show, said the purpose of the show was to lance a bubble every week, and to educate Britons about what the government was doing in their name. ""Thatcher was one of the main reasons we did 'Spitting Image' -- I knew why I was doing it and I would have killed my mother to have done it,"" he said. ""I knew what she was about and what she intended to do, things such as the mindless thuggery of the Falklands war."" Law, who now divides his time between Australia and China, said he and his colleagues tried various ways to portray the PM. ""The puppets were just heightened versions of reality, so there were three Thatchers: one that talked to you as if your dog had died; one that shouted at you and a foaming-at-the-mouth one. There never really was a smiley Thatcher. What would be the point?"" In one famous scene set in a restaurant, a waiter asks Thatcher, who is treating her ministers to a meal, what she would like to eat: ""Steak, raw please,"" comes the reply. ""And what about the vegetables?"" asks the waiter. ""Oh, they'll have the same as me."" The scene mocks Thatcher's Cabinet colleagues as being weak and ineffectual, and while Law admits he was worried about glorifying Thatcher, he said he tried to be fair to both sides. ""We dished out the same stick to everybody, including (opposition leader Neil) Kinnock, but at least we tried to get it right."" Thatcher left Britain in a worse situation than before she came to power, Law believes. ""I believe she had a strong effect on what happened here. She threw a lot of people to the dogs and you're seeing now what she actually did. I'm still angry about that now. ""When you think of how our parents worked, when you could go to the doctor without thinking about the money. People like myself got half an education. I went to art school from a working class background without qualifications simply because I had some talent. Try doing that now. All of that has gone, and you know that was her aim. It's what she wanted. ""I don't have any answers like lots of other critics. But take a look around you. The people who came after inherited the mantle of Thatcher: her heirs ... the bitch she left behind was Tony Blair ... and now we have a huge underclass. Give up on consensus politics, and the notion of educating everybody properly. F**k 'em, basically.""","Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is dead at 87, spokeswoman says .

"(CNN) -- The 20-year-old student accused in a stabbing rampage at a Texas college campus told investigators he had fantasies of killing people and had planned the attack, sheriff's officials said late Tuesday. Dylan Quick, 20, was charged with three counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon after the stabbings, said Donna Hawkins, an official with the Harris County Prosecutor's Office. ""According to the statement the suspect voluntarily gave investigators, he has had fantasies of stabbing people to death since he was in elementary school,"" a statement from the Harris County Sheriff's Office said. ""He also indicated that he has been planning this incident for some time."" Quick used ""a razor-type knife"" to stab victims at the Lone Star College's CyFair campus Tuesday, the sheriff office's statement said. Fourteen people were injured in the attack, officials said. Two of them remained hospitalized in critical condition late Tuesday, said Kathryn Klein, a spokeswoman for the Memorial Hermann Texas Trauma Institute. Witnesses of the attack at the campus northwest of Houston described a chaotic scene. Bleeding victims collapsed to the ground. Many students and teachers ran for cover. Some sprang into action, chasing after the suspect and helping the wounded. Cassie Foe was in the school's nursing lab when she heard a scream coming from the hallway. Moments later, the nursing student put her training into action, placing pressure on a wound in a stabbing victim's neck as an attacker went on a rampage at the Lone Star College's CyFair campus. ""It just seemed like he was just going around, basically getting whoever was more open and easiest for him to reach,"" Foe told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Tuesday. Steven Maida said he saw so many people swarming that he thought it was a campus tour. Then, he saw them running and heard someone say: ""My friend's been stabbed."" Maida said he saw blood on a stairway and several injured victims. One wounded woman had a hole in her throat, one had a hole in her cheek and another victim had a stab wound in the back of his head, Maida said. ""I just took off downstairs running,"" he said. Finding the attacker was his goal, he said. Maida told CNN he was among a group of students that chased the suspect, tackled him and pinned him down until authorities arrived. ""I couldn't run the other way like everyone else was,"" he said. Authorities could not be reached immediately to confirm Maida's account. Earlier Tuesday, Harris County Sheriff's Deputy Thomas Gilliland said authorities received an initial report that the suspect had been wrestled to the ground by a student before campus police arrested him. Garcia said a call came in to 911 Tuesday morning describing a ""male on the loose stabbing people"" at the school. At least one injured victim had what appeared to be the blade of a box cutter or an X-Acto knife sticking out of her cheek, student Melody Vinton told CNN affiliate KHOU. Vinton said she had just left her chemistry class when she saw the attacker stabbing people, aiming at their necks and faces. Soon, she was trying to help victims, ripping a paper towel dispenser off a bathroom wall to get enough paper to help stem the bleeding. ""I turned around and there was just blood. Just blood dripping down the stairs, all over the floor, all over everyone's towels on their necks, just a lot of blood,"" told KHOU. ""There's no humanity in that. Just to see another human being do that was more traumatic than anything."" Another student, 19-year-old Maya Khalil, snapped photos of the chaos as it unfolded, posting pictures on Twitter that showed a bandaged student on a stretcher and police and paramedics swarming the scene. ""It was really scary,"" she told CNN. Most of the victims had lacerations in their head and neck areas, said Robert Rasa, a spokesman for the CyFair Volunteer Fire Department. ""We were literally going from building to building, room to room, looking for patients, setting up triage,"" he said. The school was on lockdown Tuesday afternoon while authorities combed the campus to ensure no other injured people or attackers were there, Harris County sheriff's spokesman Alan Bernstein said. While authorities investigated, teachers and students huddled together in locked rooms, said Marianna Sviland, a teacher at the college who was in a faculty workroom at the time of the stabbing. ""Outside the window, I saw cops running around, I saw students running and I realized something was going on,"" she said. ""It was scary."" By 2 p.m. (3 p.m. ET), students and staff were allowed to leave campus, Sviland said. Details about the victim's injuries were unclear Tuesday afternoon. Bernstein said it wasn't clear whether all of the injured people were stabbed. ""It's possible other people were running away"" and became injured that way, he said. Four injured victims ""were in a dire enough situation that they were taken out on helicopters,"" Bernstein said. ""I do believe the confrontation was limited to a few (classrooms) or just one classroom -- not anybody roaming around and getting into a large number of areas,"" Bernstein said. The school posted a warning on its website: ""Stay away from the area. Seek shelter in a secure location until the incident is resolved."" The campus was scheduled to reopen for classes Wednesday morning. Officials said counselors would be speaking with faculty and students. Tuesday's incident comes more than two months after three people were wounded in a shooting at a different Lone Star College campus -- the North Harris campus in Houston. CNN's Dave Alsup, Chandler Friedman, Jason Morris, Ed Lavandera, Greg Botelho, Paul Caron, Chuck Johnston, Ashley Fantz and Jason Hanna contributed to this report.","NEW: Sheriff: The suspect told investigators he fantasized about stabbing .

"New York (CNN) -- The family of late Beatles music icon John Lennon on Wednesday voiced opposition to a controversial process of natural gas drilling known as fracking, . Sean Lennon, who appeared at a press conference in New York with his mother, Yoko Ono, said fracking is ""dirty, it's just inherently dirty."" ""The bottom line is there is a campaign of misinformation to try to tell people that hydraulic fracturing is a clean alternative to coal or other fossil fuels,"" he said. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is expected to take up the decision on whether to allow fracking, or horizontal hydraulic fracturing, which involves pumping millions of gallons of water and chemicals into shale formations deep beneath the Earth's surface. This process causes the fracturing of the rock and the release of natural gas, but has raised concerns over the potential for chemicals to seep into the drinking water supply. Drought-stricken fracking firms turn to farms' water wells for help . Lennon unveiled a campaign called ""Artists Against Fracking"" to oppose the expansion of the process while it is under review by New York's Department of Environmental Conservation. The regulatory decision would not require a vote in the state legislature. Lennon's family acquired a farm in upstate New York in the 1970s, and he said he grew concerned about fracking after being invited to a community meeting held by the natural gas industry that was seeking to expand drilling. Those concerns led Lennon to form ""Artists Against Fracking,"" with his mother's help, and to sign up former Beatles Sir Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, as well as actors Mark Ruffalo and Anne Hathaway, among more than 100 other artists. ""We just asked friends to call friends and it accelerated from there,"" Lennon said. ""When people who don't know much about it, or are on the fence, when they realize that it's water and air, which is something we all relate to and depend on, most reasonable people want to get on board."" A de facto moratorium on horizontal hydraulic fracturing has been in place since 2010 while the state conducts an environmental review of the process, which is widespread in neighboring Pennsylvania, which shares the Marcellus Shale formation with New York. Cornell Engineering Professor Anthony Ingraffea, who appeared at the Artists Against Fracking conference, said industry data show one out of 20 wells leak. ""No matter what the industry tells you, their own data ... proves conclusively to any reasonable scientist or engineer that it is impossible to design any well so it will never leak,"" Ingraffea said. ""Wells will leak. Wells do leak. The best and the brightest in that industry have been trying to solve that problem for 100 years."" But John Holko, president of Lenape Resources, which operates 237 wells in New York using the older vertical hydraulic method, said he did not believe the figures on well leakage were accurate. ""I have not seen data that supports that."" The Independent Oil and Gas Association of New York, which advocates for the drilling industry, said fracking had helped reduce U.S. carbon dioxide emissions to their lowest levels since the early 1990s. ""Artists who have turned into activists on this issue are being led by those who are more comfortable twisting the facts and taking part in street theater, stunts and gimmicks,"" said IOGA President Brad Gill. ""They are ignoring the prosperity and environmental protection that modern natural gas development is bringing to many other states."" The renewed debate over fracking came after press reports that Cuomo was nearing a decision on allowing limited fracking in five counties in southeastern New York, near the Pennsylvania border. But a spokesman for Cuomo said no decision had been reached, and was not expected to come for weeks. Any move would follow the release of a final report by the state Department of Environmental Conservation. ""Our review of high-volume hydraulic fracturing is continuing and no decisions have been made,"" the agency said, noting it was preparing a response to the 80,000 comments received from the public. ""Once we review the comments, we will make any necessary changes to the documents. We will most likely release the final documents by the end of the year."" According to analysts, the U.S. Energy Policy Act of 2005 exempted industry from federal oversight, meaning that all regulatory authority falls to state authorities, rather than the Environmental Protection Agency. It is up to Cuomo to decide whether to proceed with fracking. It will fall upon the Department of Environmental Conservation to issue permits for horizontal hydraulic fracturing.

"(CNN) -- Redoine Faid fashioned himself as a modern-day gangster. He thought big -- getting inspiration from the movies, as when he wore a hockey mask like Robert DeNiro's character in ""Heat"" -- and acted audaciously, attacking armored trucks among other targets. After more than a decade in prison, though, the Frenchman insisted he'd sworn off his wicked ways. This promise didn't last for long, according to French authorities. In 2011, a year after his autobiography came out, Faid landed back behind bars. Now, he is once again free -- and, once again, the subject of an international manhunt after his brazen escape from prison. Faid held five people, including four guards, at gunpoint at a detention center in the northern city of Lille on Saturday, officials said. He then burst his way to freedom, detonating explosives to destroy five doors, penitentiary union spokesman Etienne Dobrometz told CNN affiliate BFMTV. Where he is now is anyone's guess. French Justice Minister Christiane Taubira told reporters on Saturday that a European arrest warrant covering 26 countries has been issued, and that Interpol is working to track him down as well. One person not surprised by Faid's breakout is his lawyer, Jean-Louis Pelletier. In a few days, Pelletier had planned to meet his client in preparation of an upcoming trial tied to a May 2010 attack in Villiers-sur-Marne, east of Paris, that left a 26-year-old policewoman dead. ""He is remarkably intelligent, and he is using his intellect to serve his ambitions,"" Pelletier told BFMTV. ""(And Faid) cannot stand being imprisoned anymore."" Questions raised about prison's security . In his 2010 autobiography, ""Robber: From Suburbs to Organized Crime,"" Faid chronicled his progression from a petty thief to one of France's most notorious criminals, according to the book's publisher, La Manufacture De Livres. In 1998, after three years on the run during which he fled to Switzerland, Faid was finally caught. Sentenced to 20 years, he ended up spending more than 10 years in high-security prisons around France. After getting out, Faid put himself out there -- not only with his book, but as the subject of numerous interviews. The high-adrenaline life of crime he described resembled that of another famous French gangster, Jacques Mesrine. The country's most wanted man in the 1970s, Mesrine made his name as a charismatic, press-courting criminal known for his daring bank heists and spectacular prison breaks. Mesrine's story ended in 1979, when he was gunned down by police on the streets of Paris. Faid's prison escape Saturday evokes some of that brand of criminal bravado. But it also raises a number of questions: How did an inmate gets guns and explosives? How did he manage to use those to force his way out? And, after all that, why is he still at large? The four guards who Faid allegedly held hostage ""are safe and sound,"" said Lille prosecutor Frederic Fevre. Still, officials from the prison guards' union pressed Taubira to provide better safety measures inside prisons, including more thorough searches of those who enter, BFMTV reported. Built in 2005, the Lille-Sequedin penitentiary from which Faid escaped is not old, but it's not well designed to keep watch of prisoners, said Jimmy Delliste, a former associate director there. ""The construction ... makes it particularly difficult to manage detainees, who are particularly difficult to watch,"" Delliste told BFMTV.","Redoine Faid was a wanted criminal in the '90s known for attacking armored trucks .

"(CNN) -- We have many heroes: historic figures who battled for freedom, a man who jumps on the railway tracks to save someone from certain death, a whistle-blower who identifies corruption in government or industry. While these forms of heroism focus on a willingness to take risks in the service of other people or noble ideals, the most ancient notion of heroism focuses on humanity's ability to transcend its own physical limitations. Occasionally, there is a man or woman who appears to be almost superhuman in strength and physical ability. The Greeks had Achilles and Athena. Up until yesterday, we had Lance Armstrong. It is unlikely that we will ever know the truth about Lance Armstrong's situation -- was it truly a heroic journey, battling his own body's limits to demonstrate the pinnacle of human capability -- despite the intense personal costs of competing in the Tour de France? Or was it a tainted attempt to win glory? And why can't it ever be simple -- why can't we have a hero who is beyond reproach? Cyclists say 'good riddance' As a researcher who focuses on heroic action and the ascription of heroic status, I know that heroism is rarely simple. In fact, in a paper that I authored with my colleagues Kathy Blau and Dr. Philip Zimbardo, we argued that heroism is fundamentally paradoxical. First, the action of heroism is typically an intensely private and personal endeavor, even when these actions are taken under the glaring spotlight of the media; but the ascription of heroic status is a fundamentally public activity -- the personal actions taken by one individual are observed and interpreted by others, rightly or wrongly. If we consider the possibility that Armstrong's 500-plus drug tests were negative as an indicator that he never doped, this is an incredible testament not just to his physical strength, but his moral fortitude. If this is the case, he was able to resist an ongoing temptation that occurred in private, after all the cameras where off and the fans had gone home. This brings us to our second paradox. It is human nature to at once hunger for and elevate exemplars of heroism, while we simultaneously often want to negate the actual actions of a real hero. One of the implications of our research is that all forms of heroism result in some level of controversy; seeing someone run into a burning building to save another may look heroic to one bystander but foolish to another. Lance Armstrong faces lifetime ban . A lot rides on the outcome. If a woman who goes into a building is successful in rescuing the trapped victim in the inferno, she is a hero. But if she fails, or she is injured, the risk she took is seen as having been too great, even though the actual risk calculus she took in the moment of action does not change. Moreover, someone willing to act heroically fundamentally challenges our own notions of ourselves. Heroes are, in some ways, subtly dangerous to our sense of social order. Even though they are human, just like the rest of us, their actions are outside of the normal human experience. If there is a whistleblower in our office -- even if his or her motives are noble -- it is human nature to search for an alternative explanation. Maybe this person was really disgruntled at the boss. With Lance Armstrong, there is a natural tendency, perhaps in all of us, to say, ""See, I told you so, no one could be that good."" The sad part of Armstrong's story -- of the titles being stripped away -- is that we lose either way. If he did dope, it is just another example in a recent string of high-profile heroic failures. Joe Paterno's career, built up over many years of good decisions, was washed away by an incident he should have acted on. The captain of the Costa Concordia's momentary lapse led to the deaths of 32 people; abandoning ship before his passengers led to his disgrace. But if Armstrong didn't dope, it won't matter. The news cycles will have already done their work. There is doubt now, and that is often the beginning of the end of our willingness to attach the word ""hero"" to someone in our own minds. We have lost a figure who was willing to challenge the limits of human performance, to show us what we are truly capable of if we put everything we have into accomplishing a seemingly insurmountable goal. Armstrong's story of setbacks and triumphs brought us closer to the essence of the human endeavor. What's behind the Armstrong headlines? While it is easy to say that one slip-up means someone can't be hero, it is also important for us to remember that negating all of this person's actions over a few mistakes also lets us off the hook. No hero is without flaws. None of us is. But if we allow ourselves the luxury of saying, ""See, he's just like the rest of us,"" we no longer have to challenge ourselves to perform at the limits of our own personal capability. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Zeno Franco.","Zeno Franco: Sometimes we pick heroes who, like Armstrong, transcend physical limitations .
But heroism a paradox: It's private, but it acquires the heroic label as a public activity, he says .
At the same time humans hunger for heroic exemplars of heroism, while negating real heroism .
Franco: If we revel in Armstrong's fall as equalizing, we let ourselves off the hook for heroism ."
"(CNN) -- Convicted serial rapist Gary Irving was offered a weekend of freedom by a judge in Massachusetts before reporting to jail. He took nearly 35 years. One of Massachusetts' most wanted fugitives was living a quiet life in Gorham, Maine, until he was arrested Wednesday night at his home. Irving, 52, was found living under the name Gregg Irving, Massachusetts State Police spokesman Dave Procopio said Friday in a statement. Irving was convicted in 1978 of raping three young women in Norfolk County, Massachusetts. According to Massachusetts State Police, Judge Robert Prince released the 18-year-old defendant on bail to his parents in order to make final arrangements before sentencing. Irving, facing the possibility of life in prison, never returned. Massachusetts State Police put Irving on their ""Most Wanted"" list and launched a manhunt. Louis Sabadini, the Norfolk County prosecutor for the case in 1978, told CNN he had advised Prince, who died in 2010, not to release Irving before his sentencing because he knew he would run. Sabadini said he had hoped Irving would be sent straight to state prison and was surprised by Prince's decision to grant bail because there was no longer a presumption of innocence. ""Usually the judges, even the easy ones, will revoke bail if (the defendant) is found guilty,"" Sabadini said. ""I think most people would run."" Irving had been convicted of three counts of rape with force, unnatural acts and kidnapping, Massachusetts State Police said. In one incident, Irving knocked the victim off her bike and brought her to a secluded area, where he repeatedly raped her. During another, Irving threatened a victim with a knife if she did not comply with his sexual demands. Since he fled, Irving's profile has been featured on the TV shows ""America's Most Wanted,"" ""Unsolved Mysteries"" and ""Real Stories of the Highway Patrol,"" according to the Most Wanted poster. Investigators found numerous handguns and long guns in his home in Gorham on Wednesday. Irving did not possess the guns legally and will be charged by federal authorities on firearms offenses, Procopio said. Sabadini, now retired and living in Norwell, Massachusetts, told CNN that most lawyers quickly move on to the next case, but this one never quite left his mind. ""It did bother me,"" he said. ""Rapists generally have a tendency to commit that crime over and over again, so I don't know what (Irving) has been doing all those years."" Maine State Police, Gorham police and FBI agents joined the investigation and aided in the arrest, Procopio said. Irving is being held in Portland, Maine. He is scheduled for a hearing Monday morning at Cumberland County Courthouse, according to Stephen McClausland, spokesman for the Maine State Police. Irving's lawyer, Christopher Leddy, told CNN that he would not comment on the case until after the hearing Monday. ""Please understand that this is an extremely difficult situation for Mr. Irving's family and they would like to be given some space for now,"" Leddy said. CNN's Laura Ly contributed to this report.","Gary Irving fled before sentencing in Massachusetts in 1978 .

"(CNN) -- Can you be identified only by where you take your phone? Yes, according to a new study, which finds it's not very hard at all. While most of us are free to go wherever we want, our daily and weekly movement patterns are pretty predictable. We go to work, to school, to church, to our neighborhood gym, grocery store or coffee shop, and we come home -- all quietly tracked by the GPS in our phone. And with nothing more than this anonymous location data, someone who wanted to badly enough could easily figure out who you are by tracking your smartphone. Patterns of our movements, when traced on a map, create something akin to a fingerprint that is unique to every person. Those are the findings of a report by researchers from MIT and elsewhere, published this week in the journal Scientific Reports. They say that, throughout history, people have always yearned for some degree of privacy, and there have always been others who wanted to keep an eye on them. With modern technology, they say, tracking people is easier than ever. ""Modern information technologies such as the Internet and mobile phones, however, magnify the uniqueness of individuals, further enhancing the traditional challenges to privacy,"" they wrote. ""Mobility data is among the most sensitive data currently being collected. Mobility data contains the approximate whereabouts of individuals and can be used to reconstruct individuals' movements across space and time."" The growing push to track your location indoors . For the study, the research team studied 15 months of anonymous mobile data for roughly 1.5 million people. What they found was that, if they got accurate hourly updates on a person's whereabouts, tracked by their mobile carrier's cell towers, four ""data points"" were all they needed to figure out the person's identity 95% of the time. That's the sort of thing that has privacy advocates, like the Electronic Frontier Foundation, worried. In a wrap-up of last year's developments in mobile privacy, the group's Hanni Fakhoury and Marcia Hofmann noted that, in multiple cases, law enforcement has approached wireless carriers for mobile data to track users. At least one court has ruled that users have no reasonable expectation of privacy regarding their cell phone data. ""(T)he government claims that cell phone users give up their privacy rights because they have voluntarily disclosed their physical location to the cell phone providers every time a phone connects to the provider's cell tower,"" EFF said in a statement related to an October court case. ""... However, this theory undermines privacy in nearly any networked communication."" Increasingly, the makers of mobile operating systems are opening up anonymous location data to developers designing apps that do things like target local advertising to the users. Apple, for example, states in its privacy policy that it can share anonymous mobile data with ""partners and licensees."" The study's authors said keeping data anonymous is not necessarily enough to ensure real privacy. ""A simply anonymized dataset does not contain name, home address, phone number or other obvious identifier,"" they wrote. ""Yet, if individual's patterns are unique enough, outside information can be used to link the data back to an individual."" So, for example, say that you wake up at home every morning, head to the office five days a week, then hit the gym on three of those days. That's three data points already. Then maybe you go to the same church, or restaurant for brunch, every Sunday. There's the fourth -- plenty to figure out who you are, the authors say. Every additional location you hit regularly just makes it that much easier. Like EFF, the study's authors said that has troubling implications. ""These findings represent fundamental constraints to an individual's privacy and have important implications for the design of frameworks and institutions dedicated to protect the privacy of individuals,"" they wrote.","Report: It's easy to identify smartphone users by their movements .

"Rome (CNN) -- Italian Supreme Court judges have heard the arguments, now they must decide whether to order American Amanda Knox to stand trial for a second time in the death of her former roommate. The judges concluded a hearing into the question early Monday afternoon, and were expected to announce their decision soon. Knox spent four years in jail before an appellate court overturned her murder conviction in the 2007 death of Meredith Kercher. She returned to the United States in 2011. Prosecutors say that despite the appellate decision, they still believe Knox and her former boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, are responsible for the death. ""We are still convinced that they are the co-authors of Meredith's homicide,"" Italian news agency ANSA quoted Perugia, Italy, prosecutor Giovanni Galati as saying. Knox, who is not in Italy for the hearing, is confident in the Italian legal system and hopes one day to return to Italy as a free woman, her lawyer, Luciano Ghirga, said Monday. If the acquittal is overturned, the case will go back to an appellate court and Knox might have to return to Italy. If she refuses, the Italian government could appeal to the U.S. government for her extradition. But even if it does, Knox still not might end up before an Italian court. U.S. officials might reject such a request because it violates the U.S. legal principle that a criminal defendant can't be tried twice on the same allegation, said Joey Jackson, a contributor for HLN's ""In Session."" Italy lacks the absolute prohibition present in U.S. law preventing authorities from retrying a criminal defendant who has been acquitted of a charge. ""We have principles that are well-founded within our Constitution, one of which is double jeopardy,"" he said. ""So as a result of that, I think it would be highly objectionable for the United States to surrender someone to another country for which justice has already been administered and meted out. So I don't think or anticipate that that would happen."" 2011: Amanda Knox judge explains murder acquittal . The case began in 2007, after Knox moved to Perugia to study at the University for Foreigners of Perugia for one year . Knox, then 20, shared a room with British student Kercher, 21. That November, Kercher's semi-naked body was found at the home, with her throat slashed. Police arrested Knox and Sollecito, who was her boyfriend at the time. 2011: Was Italy fair to Amanda Knox? Two years later they were convicted of murder, but were cleared when they appealed the verdicts in 2011. Another man, Ivorian drifter Rudy Guede, was convicted separately of Kercher's killing. Guede admitted having sexual relations with Kercher but denied killing her. In legal paperwork published in December 2011, the judge in the case wrote that the jury had cleared the pair of murder for lack of evidence proving they were guilty. Knox's family said last year the appeal was unwelcome, but no cause for concern. ""The appeal of Amanda's acquittal by the prosecution was not unexpected as they had indicated from the day of the verdict that they would appeal,"" a family statement in February 2012 said. 2011: Knox makes emotional return to Seattle . Knox has spent the last year and a half trying to resume a normal life, studying at the University of Washington in Seattle, her hometown. She has written a book on her ordeal, titled ""Waiting to be Heard,"" which will be published next month. Francesco Sollecito, father of Raffaele, told CNN in a phone interview last year that the family was ""not happy about the decision (to appeal). My son is trying to get back to normal life."" ""We can do very little in this situation,"" he said, but as Italian citizens, they would have to accept the court's decision. ""We hope that the high court will finally put the words 'the end' to this story."" Bed Wedeman reported from Rome; Ed Payne reported and wrote from Atlanta; CNN's Michael Pearson also contributed to this report.","A decision on retrying Amanda Knox is expected soon .

"(CNN) -- A pistol in the hands of a 4-year-old boy went off during a weekend cookout, killing the wife of a Tennessee sheriff's deputy who was showing his guns to a relative, state police said Monday. No one saw the boy pick up the weapon before the shooting, which occurred Saturday night in Lebanon, east of Nashville, Tennessee Bureau of Investigation spokeswoman Kristin Helm said. The single shot killed 47-year-old Josephine Fanning, the wife of Wilson County Sheriff's Deputy Daniel Fanning. The couple were hosting family and friends at their house when Daniel Fanning and a relative went into a bedroom to check out some of Fanning's guns, Helm said. Josephine Fanning and the boy walked into the room later, and at some point the boy picked the loaded pistol up off the bed. Helm said she wasn't sure of the relationship between the boy and the Fannings. The TBI, which investigates incidents involving law enforcement officers, is still conducting its probe, and no charges have been filed. The gun involved was Fanning's personal weapon, not his service pistol, she said.","A gunshot kills the wife of a Tennessee sheriff's deputy .

"(CNN) -- Tensions are high in Kenya after the recent general elections saw front-runner, Prime Minister Raila Odinga, contest the Electoral commission's decision to declare Uhuru Kenyatta the winner. And nowhere is the tension more palpable than on social network platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. Online, supporters of Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila Odinga often engage in a war of words that reveal deep tribal animosity. But the common ground that both groups seem to stand on is confidence that the Supreme Court -- set up under the new constitution -- will give the case a fair hearing. ""I would say that the constitution of Kenya that was put in place in 2010 has considered the scenario we are currently facing,"" said Charles Kanjama, a partner at Kenyan law firm Muma and Kanjama advocates. ""The reason why the different political parties are confident and have recourse to the court is because they're very clear that the court can deal with this."" At the center of the court case is the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission of Kenya (IEBC) which Raila Odinga accuses of failing to ensure a free and fair election and thus subverting the outcome of the presidential election. Electoral officials deny any voter manipulation, and the IEBS says it is confident that the final result was credible. The Supreme Court, meanwhile, has ordered a partial recount to determine whether the number of votes was higher than the number of registered voters. Kenyatta narrowly won the presidential poll, clinching 50.07% of the vote, just breaking past the halfway mark needed for the victory. Raila Odinga has called for a new election. He and many of his supporters say that the court case is a test of Kenya's democracy. ""This is a crisis in the very workings of the faith that Kenyans have placed in their institutions to respect their democratic rights and the rule of law. It is democracy that is on trial,"" Odinga said. For Kenya's Supreme Court, the stakes are incredibly high -- there is the question of ensuring the country's confidence in its institutions after the disputed 2007 election when some 1,000 people were killed after Odinga also lost that vote, claiming the election had been rigged. He later became prime minister in a power-sharing agreement. With this election, it has been relatively peaceful -- and it is hoped that things will remain that way as the country waits for the court ruling. The law gives the Supreme Court timelines within which it needs to arrive at a verdict. In this case, the court has until the Saturday of the Easter holiday to make a ruling. Analysts in the Kenyan media are saying that if Kenyans across the political sphere can abide by their decision, no matter how it goes, then it will truly be evidence that the country has moved on.

"London (CNN) -- Mahdi Hashi came to Britain with his family as a six-year-old, fleeing the civil war in Somalia. He grew up in London. But his family says that when he turned 16, Britain's MI5 secret service asked Hashi to become a spy -- willingly or not. ""They always used to tell him, 'you either work for us or you are guilty of being a terrorist,'"" his father, Mohamad Hashi, told CNN. Mahdi Hashi filed an official complaint and his local lawmaker met with MI5 representatives. But, his family says, the pressure persisted. His father, returning from a pilgrimage to the Haj, was stopped at the airport by two people he claims identified themselves as working for MI5. ""I told them, listen, I'm on your side. As a father, I don't want my son to be in danger. And I don't want him to harm anyone. Put on the table what kind of proof you have against my son. Let's cooperate and work together as a parent,"" he said. ""But they never had anything -- which is what makes me believe that they had another agenda. Which is the one he always mentioned. That they want him to be an informant and work for them."" This pressure was the reason for his son's return to Somalia, Mohamad Hashi said. ""He never had peace here. He was being harassed all the time."" Mahdi Hashi traveled to Egypt and Syria as a teenager. Then, in 2010, his family says, Hashi returned to Mogadishu. He got married, had a child and then, in December 2011, he disappeared. Stripped of citizenship . In July last year, his family received a letter from Britain's Home Office stating that Hashi had been stripped of his citizenship for the ""public good."" ""The reason for this decision is that the Security Service assess that you have been involved in Islamist extremism and present a risk to the national security of the United Kingdom due to your extremist activities,"" the letter says. Then, on December 21, 2012 -- almost a year after he disappeared -- Hashi turned up in a U.S. criminal court in Brooklyn, New York, charged with ""material support"" of a terror organization, Al-Shabaab, and allegedly training to be a suicide bomber. Two other men were charged with him. ""As alleged, these defendants are not aspiring terrorists, they are terrorists. They did more than receive terrorist training: they put that training to practice in terrorist operations with Al-Shabaab. Their capture and prosecution are important steps in the continuing campaign against terrorism,"" said George Venizelos, the assistant director in charge of the FBI's field office in New York, in a statement announcing the charges in December. Hashi denies all the charges, according to his American lawyer, Harry Batchelder. A statement from the FBI says Hashi was arrested in ""Africa"" by local police in August last year and then handed to the FBI. According to his lawyers, Hashi says he was detained in Djibouti in June. He saw cellmates beaten and tortured with electric shocks there, Hashi says. He claims he was given a choice in Djibouti: Sign a confession or be tortured. Eventually he was turned over to U.S. authorities, who flew him to the United States, Batchelder said. The lawyer cites the FBI as saying he arrived in late November. Hashi's British citizenship was stripped from him just a short time before he was put on a plane to the United States, Batchelder said. That move is being challenged before a special board of immigration appeal, he said. ""But as of now, the British government has offered no assistance to this matter whatsoever."" 'New and improved rendition' Hashi's father doesn't understand how his son has ended up in a Brooklyn criminal court. ""He has never been to the United States even for a holiday. He has never threatened the United States. We don't know why he was taken all the way there,"" he said. From his parents' point of view, he was kidnapped and taken to the United States. Batchelder said Hashi's case is an example of a disturbing new trend he has heard called ""new and improved rendition."" ""I mean that the agonies that were inflicted in earlier renditions, the government has reacted to that, but they still take people from foreign countries, bring them into the United States, and they're going to try him here,"" the attorney said. ""In my mind, that has long-term ramifications that, if carried out to their logical end, would mean the 20,000 people in Somalia are now eligible to be brought to the United States and tried in a U.S. court. That's a little bit disturbing, and that's an understatement."" Because he is no longer considered a British citizen, Hashi has received no help from the British government. His mother told CNN it has changed the way she thinks of her adopted homeland. ""When we came this country, it was (as) you know, asylum seeker,"" she said. ""They said you are welcome. And now (they say) you are welcome to be hunted. For our kids, our brothers and sisters. The whole community, not only my son."" Mahdi Hashi is now fighting to regain his British citizenship while in a New York detention center. But exactly how he disappeared off the streets of Mogadishu and reappeared in a Brooklyn courtroom remains a mystery.

"Colorado Springs, Colorado (CNN) -- A black Cadillac, bullet casings and a pizza box appear to connect a parolee with ties to a white supremacist prison gang to the shooting death of Colorado's prisons chief, according to a search warrant affidavit obtained Friday by CNN. The affidavit, filed by the Texas Department of Public Safety's Ranger Division, details what authorities believe links Evan Spencer Ebel, who died in a shootout with sheriff's deputies in Texas, and the Colorado killing of state prisons chief Tom Clements. Of key focus in the affidavit is a 1991 black Cadillac that authorities say Ebel was driving in a wild, high-speed chase Thursday that saw the 28-year-old open fire on sheriff's deputies before slamming into an 18-wheeler, climbing out of the wreckage and opening fire again. Hours later, Ebel died from a gunshot wound to head suffered during the shootout, leaving behind more questions than answers in a case that has spanned two states. On Friday, the wreckage of the Cadillac was under intense scrutiny after witnesses reported a similar vehicle -- a black, boxy car with Colorado license plates -- near the Monument, Colorado, house of Clements on Tuesday, the day he was killed. Among the links in the cases, according to the affidavit, are shell casings from a 9mm handgun found at Clements house. They are the same brand and caliber used in the shooting of a Wise County, Texas, sheriff's deputy, it said. Video: Pizza deliveryman remembered . In the Cadillac's trunk was a Domino's Pizza box carrier and a Dominos uniform jacket, it said. That pizza carrier and jacket are a key reason why Denver authorities are also in Texas to examine the Cadillac. They are investigating the killing of 27-year-old Nathan Collin Leon, a Domino's Pizza deliveryman in Denver. Leon disappeared from work on Sunday and was found dead in the Denver suburb of Golden. Leon's family said he delivered pizzas as a way to earn extra money for his wife and his three girls. Denver investigators tell CNN there is a ""strong connection"" between the killings of Leon and Clements. Even as the investigation appears to link Ebel to the shooting, authorities have said little about a possible motive. Did Ebel kill a pizza deliveryman to get a hold of his uniform as part of an effort to disguise himself? Did he target Clements because of the prison chief's crackdown on white supremacist gangs in prison? Was he part of a wider conspiracy to kill Clements? Or was it something else? High-speed chase in Texas . This much is known: On Thursday, Ebel sped through Montague County, Texas, near the Oklahoma state line, about 700 miles from Monument. Deputy James Boyd tried to pull the car over. It's unclear exactly why, other than it would have a been a routine part of Boyd's job. Boyd did not know about the Clements case, authorities said. Ebel shot the deputy three times, hitting him twice in the chest and grazing his head. Wearing a bulletproof vest, the deputy managed to call for help and to tell law enforcement which way Ebel was driving. Authorities say they have looked at the dashcam video of the shooting. Boyd remains hospitalized at a Dallas-Fort Worth area hospital. The information the deputy gave allowed law enforcement to catch up with Ebel. A high-speed chase ensued, ending about 30 miles away in Decatur, Texas, with Ebel firing out of his window at police, law enforcement said. ""I would say he was running about 100 mph, and he had his left arm out the window and he was just shooting,"" said Decatur Police Chief Rex Hoskins, whose patrol car was parked in the median as the Cadillac raced past. The chase ended when the Cadillac screeched onto another road and slammed into an 18-wheel truck, authorities said. With the front of his car crushed, Ebel got out and started shooting again. Ebel didn't hit any officers this time, they said. But they shot him. He was taken to an area hospital where he was pronounced dead Thursday night, authorities said. A prison conspiracy? Since Tuesday, investigators looking into Clements' killing have told reporters they are considering numerous angles. One is that Ebel, a former member of the 211s -- a white-supremacist prison gang -- might have conspired with other inmates to kill Clements, Paula Presley of the El Paso County, Colorado, sheriff's department said. The Department of Corrections told investigators that Ebel was a prison gang member, she said on CNN on Friday. Clements earned widespread recognition for not only prison reforms but for a crackdown on prison gangs, including the 211s. Citing media coverage of the shooting and its possible connection with the the 211s, authorities locked down Colorado's prisons on Friday, said state Department of Corrections spokeswoman Alison Morgan. ""We are on full lockdown over the weekend, no visitation or volunteer programs,"" she said. Suspect's troubled past . As authorities look for possible links in the case, a troubling portrait began to emerge of Ebel. By all accounts, Ebel came from a privileged upbringing. His father, Jack Ebel, an attorney and former oil executive, counts Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper among his friends. ""When I first came out to Colorado 30 years ago, he and I worked in the same oil company,"" Hickenlooper told reporters Friday. The governor described Jack Ebel as ""generous to a fault,"" but said the son ""had a bad streak."" ""We knew his son growing up that he just had a bad streak,"" Hickenlooper told CNN affiliate KUSA. ""I think Jack, his wife, they did everything they could."" Hickenlooper, who did not go into details about the behavior, said he first learned the younger Ebel was a suspect in the killing of Clements on Thursday. His first reaction? ""There can't be two Evan Ebels."" ""I didn't even know Evan was out,"" Hickenlooper said, adding that he called the Ebel family a short time later. The Ebels, according to Hickenlooper, were devastated by the news. The governor said he never intervened on behalf of the younger Ebel, and he said Jack Ebel never made such a request. Lengthy prison record . In 2003, at the age of 18, Evan Ebel was charged with felony armed robbery after brandishing a gun and threatening to kill a man unless he handed over his wallet, court documents show. ""I'm not playing. ... This is not a joke,"" Ebel said as he pointed a gun at the victim's head, according to witness statements at the time. Ebel pleaded guilty to the charge and was sentenced to three years in prison, serving just over a year. Just months after his release, he was arrested again. This time for felony menacing, robbery and assault. He pleaded guilty to those charges in 2005 and was sentenced to another three years in prison. In 2006, while in prison, Ebel was charged with assaulting a detention officer, records show. He pleaded guilty and received an additional four years on his sentence. Ebel spent five years of his sentence in solitary confinement, Hickenlooper said. While the governor said he never discussed the younger Ebel by name, Hickenlooper did say he told Clements that he knew someone in solitary confinement. That person, the governor told KUSA, was Ebel. ""One of the things I told Tom Clements was that his family was concerned that it was doing more harm that good,"" he said. That statement is supported by Ebel's mother, Jody Mangue, who detailed a visit with her son in a post on memorial website she created for her 16-year-old daughter, who was killed in a car accident in 2004. ""Evan is in Canon City, Colorado in CSP, the state prison. He has over three more years left. He has pretty much been in solitary confinement for 5 years. How he has managed this ceases to amaze me, but he has used his time wisely and is quite disciplined, conditioned,"" she wrote. ""When we visit, I sit across from him, he in a chair on the other side of the thick glass. He is brought in in shackles. He spends 23 hours in his cell."" Ebel served his entire sentence and was given mandatory parole on January 28, 2013, according to the state Department of Corrections. Shift in investigation . The emerging details about the investigation appear to indicate authorities are shifting away from considering the possible involvement of Homaidan al-Turki, a Saudi national. On Thursday, Presley of the El Paso County sheriff's department said that investigators were considering the possible involvement of al-Turki after a local news outlet, citing an anonymous source, said they were looking at connections between the Saudi national and Clements. Al-Turki was convicted of sexually assaulting his housemaid at his Aurora, Colorado, home seven years ago. This month, Clements denied al-Turki's request to serve the remainder of his Colorado prison sentence in Saudi Arabia, records show. Attorneys for al-Turki did not immediately return a CNN request for comment. Read the latest news on CNN.com . CNN's Jim Spellman reported from Colorado and Ed Lavandera from Texas, and Chelsea J.

"(CNN) -- North Korea is no laggard when it comes to bluster and vituperation. For decades, the regime has issued threats of turning South Korea into a ""sea of fire"" or used choice words such as ""human scum"" or ""political idiot"" when denouncing South Korean and U.S. leaders. But even measured against such standards, North Korea's barrage over the past month, from threatening to launch an ""all-out war"" to ""diversified precision nuclear strike"" against Washington, ""wipe out"" a South Korean island, or hurling a sexist insult against Park Geun-hye, South Korea's first female elected leader, to, most recently, warning of an imminent ""moment of explosion,"" is quite unusual. And now, after saying that plans for merciless operation has been ""finally examined and ratified,"" Pyongyang is hinting at another long-range missile launch. What's going on? First, we must assume the North Korean leadership is not crazy or suicidal in spite of bizarre things it says and does. Cruel, totalitarian and solipsistic the Kim dynasty surely is. But the fact that it has managed to preserve itself for more 60 years and, in the post-Cold War era, in spite of the everyday existential threat of facing an immeasurably more successful Korean state across the border, the impoverished North has shown itself to be, if nothing else, calculating and resilient. Opinion: Kim Jong Un is not crazy . What is Pyongyang calculating? The same it has since the end of the Korean War 60 years ago. The two constants in North Korea's foreign policy are its continual calls for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea and blaming ""U.S. hostile policy"" for the tension enveloping the Korean Peninsula. Pyongyang sees the U.S. commitment to the defense of South Korea, as powerfully symbolized by the presence of American troops in the South, as the greatest impediment to its highest state task. As North Korea states in the charter to its communist party, that task is to ""(en)sure the complete victory of socialism in the northern half of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the accomplishment of the revolutionary goals of national liberation and the people's democracy on the entire area of the country."" In plain language, that means dissolving the South Korean government and communizing the entire Korean Peninsula by force. North Korea's frequent threats are a means to a long-term end. The first step is to impregnate the South Korean public with war hysteria and the illusion that the withdrawal of U.S. troops would lead to peace and reconciliation between the two Koreas. The second is to instill fear in the American public by one day demonstrating its capability to marry a nuclear warhead with an intercontinental ballistic missile with the range to hit the U.S. West Coast. When that day comes, Washington may have second thoughts about its treaty commitment to the defense of South Korea, Pyongyang calculates. So far, timing seems to be in Pyongyang's favor. Over the past year, all the major powers in North Korea's neck of the woods have undergone a leadership transition. Moreover, in Seoul, Beijing and Tokyo, leadership transitions have occurred only in recent months. That creates a particularly appeasement-prone environment, as no newly elected leader wishes to spend political capital on a foreign policy crisis created by North Korea when many other pressing domestic issues beckon. So Pyongyang reckons that after ratcheting up tension as high as it can and then simply take a little step back, it can lure its richer interlocutors into returning to talks and the kind of concessionary aid worth billions of dollars we have seen in the past. This means the risk of North Korea starting an all-out war is quite small, although there is always the possibility of miscalculation. It also means that Pyongyang will most likely not just go quietly into the night after having thumped its chest for so long. We should expect some kind of deadly, although limited, attack to come soon. How should Seoul and Washington respond? For starters, they could clamp down on the North's multifaceted criminal activities and put psychological pressure on the elites. Second, they could raise awareness on North Korea's systematic and widespread human rights violations so that democratic countries come to view the regime as a threat to humanity instead of some abstract amalgamation of the dreadful and the bizarre. This approach may not yield immediate changes in regime behavior. But at the very least it will finally put the ""stick"" in the proverbial carrot-and-stick metaphor for taming Pyongyang. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sung-Yoon Lee.","Sung-Yoon Lee: Despite threats, North Korean leadership isn't crazy or suicidal .
Lee: North Korea's goal is to get the U.S. to withdraw troops from South Korea .
He says the regime's strategy is to instill fear in South Koreans and Americans .
Lee: The risk of North Korea starting an all-out war is quite small ."
"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- The suspected cyberattack targeting South Korean banks and broadcasters originated from an IP address in China, South Korean regulators said Thursday, heightening suspicions of North Korean involvement. The attack Wednesday damaged 32,000 computers and servers at media and financial companies, South Korea's Communications Commission said. It infected banks' and broadcasters' computer networks with a malicious program, or malware, that slowed or shut down systems, officials and the semiofficial Yonhap News Agency said. Suspicion immediately fell on North Korea, which has recently renewed threats to go to war with the South amid rising tensions over Pyongyang's nuclear weapons, and missile testing and international efforts to stop them. Some past cyberattacks on South Korean organizations that officials linked to North Korea were traced to IP addresses in China. An IP address is the number that identifies a network or device on the Internet. China, which has been accused by U.S. organizations of supporting cyberattacks, said Thursday that it was aware of reports on the matter. ""We have pointed out many times that hacking is a global issue. It is anonymous and transnational,"" said Hong Lei, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman. ""Hackers would often use IP addresses from other countries to launch cyberattacks."" South Korean officials are still analyzing the cause of the network crashes and are working to prevent any further damage, the country's communications commission said. Increased alert level . The military has stepped up its cyberdefense efforts in response to the widespread outages, which hit nine companies, Yonhap reported, citing the National Police Agency. Government computer networks did not seem to be affected, Yonhap cited the National Computing and Information Agency as saying. A joint team from government, the military and private industry was responding. A South Korean official close to the investigation told CNN that malicious computer code spread through hacking caused the outages. How the hackers got in and spread the code remains under investigation, and analysts are examining the malware, the official said. U.S. flies B-52s over South Korea . Previous attacks linked to North . South Korean officials have not said who they suspect unleashed the malicious code, but experts believe it is consistent with what North Korea has done in the past. ""It's happened before in similar circumstances where there have been tensions on the peninsula,"" said Adam Segal, a cybersecurity expert with the Council on Foreign Relations. There didn't appear to be any mention of the computer crash in North Korean state media. South Korea has accused the North of similar hacking attacks before, including incidents in 2010 and 2012 that also targeted banks and media organizations. The North rejected the allegations. The outages come amid heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula, with the North angrily responding to a recent U.N. Security Council vote to impose tougher sanctions on Pyongyang after the country's latest nuclear test last month. Last week, North Korea invalidated its 60-year-old armistice with the South. It has threatened to attack its neighbor with nuclear weapons and has also threatened the United States. The armistice agreement, signed in 1953, ended the three-year war between North and South but left the two nations technically in a state of war. The United States has deployed B-52 bombers to conduct high-profile flyovers of its South Korean ally and announced that it will deploy new ground-based missile interceptors on its West Coast against the remote possibility that North Korea could strike the United States with long-range weapons. Under threat, South Koreans mull nuclear weapons . Accusations against U.S., South Korea . Last week, North Korea complained that it was the victim of ""intensive and persistent virus attacks"" from the United States and South Korea, according to KCNA, the official North Korean news agency. Yonhap said Wednesday's outages affected three broadcasters, four banks and two insurance companies. The three broadcasters -- KBS, MBC and YTN -- reported varying levels of trouble containing the virus. While the networks remained on the air, cable network YTN said editing equipment had been affected and it expected to experience broadcasting problems, Yonhap reported. Computer networks stopped working entirely at three banks -- Shinhan, Nonghyup and Jeju -- around 2 p.m. Wednesday, Yonhap reported, citing the National Police Agency. Another financial institution, Woori Bank in Seoul, reported it was able to fend off a hacking attack about the same time. The banks that were affected reported problems with a variety of systems, including Internet banking, ATMs and telecommunication services, and some branches stayed open late because of the slowdown, Yonhap said. CNN's K.J. Kwon reported from Seoul, Jethro Mullen from Hong Kong and Michael Pearson from Atlanta. Judy Kwon in Hong Kong and Dayu Zhang in Beijing contributed to this report.","NEW: China says hackers often use IP addresses from other countries .

"(CNN) -- Do 41,363 days sound like much time? You very likely won't live that long, but James Sisnett did. That's long enough to have seen the first silent movie, when it came out, provided a movie theater even existed back then on the island of Barbados, where Sisnett spent his life. He was three years old the first time Orville Wright took the first ever flight in an airplane and barely a teenager when World War I broke out. When he died Thursday, Sisnett was the oldest man in the Western Hemisphere, whose age had been validated, according to the Gerontology Research Group. He was likely the second oldest man on the planet. GRG is a private organization that verifies the ages of centenarians, people over 100 years of age, and supercentenarians, people over 110. Living as long as Sisnett did is quite a feat, but since women outlive men on the whole, there are a few women still alive between Canada and Argentina, who are even older than he was, according to GRG. Five of them live in the United States. The verified oldest living person in the world is Jiroemon Kimura of Japan. He turned 116 in April, GRG said. The oldest person who ever lived was Louise Calment of France, a woman who topped 122 years, the Guinness Book of World Records reports. On the island of Barbados, which is less than 30 miles long, Sisnett was a celebrity, family member Gerard Sisnett told CNN. He was considered a living reference for historic events there, where he was known under the nickname ""Grandad."" As a symbol of honor, he was given the keys to the capital of Bridgetown when he turned 100. That was well over a decade ago. The government may make the national stadium available for his funeral, Gerard Sisnett said. James Sisnett was born in the last year of the 19th century, on February 22, 1900, and was 113 years and 90 days old, when he passed away in his sleep, Gerard Sisnett said. That's 41,363 days, including 28 extra days for leap years. Originally a blacksmith by trade, Grandad retired in 1970. He was about 70 years of age then. That's nearly three years more than the average lifespan in the United States. Seventy years add up to 25,550 days, not including extra days from leap years. Seize one, while you can.","James Sisnett is celebrated as a witness to history on his native Barbados .

"(Parenting.com) -- What does being a mother mean when your baby is dying? How do you parent a child with no future? These questions needle the reader throughout Emily Rapp's moving and beautiful new book, ""The Still Point of the Turning World."" In January of 2011, when her son Ronan was just nine months old, Rapp learned he was dying from Tay-Sachs, a ruthless and heartbreaking disease with no cure. Ronan was given no more than three years to live. He had developed normally for six months until he simply stopped. He would very gradually unravel, fading away from her piece by piece, until his death in February of this year. Rapp, a powerfully elegant writer, turned to writing to grieve and for therapy. She processed her pain and fear on her blog, Little Seal. And now, Ronan lives on in this touching book -- as agonizing to read as it is imbued with hope and light. Parenting.com: How a Dragon Mom taught me to live in the moment . Rapp recently spoke with Parenting's Brian Braiker about Ronan, what it was like to shepherd and protect him, and what she hopes parents of healthy children can take away from her book. Parenting.com: This is one of the most personal and agonizing things one can imagine going through. How did the act of writing help you process and deal with it? Rapp: I think it totally saved me. I talk to a lot of moms who lost their children to Tay-Sachs and a lot of them had children right after their child was diagnosed. I did not. I think I used the book as a way of putting life into the world. When you're faced with death, the response is ""how do you create life?"" It gave me something to do that was a positive thing in the face of something that was just going to end in a horribly sad way. Parenting.com: What can you say about parenting without a future? What does parenting become when your baby is dying? Rapp: I think parenting is about wanting your child to have the best experience in the world possible. And I don't mean the most privileged experience. I mean the happiest. There are a lot of devastating things about this disease and one of them is that it goes against all these primal instincts we have to protect our children. But it's also a primal instinct to want to usher your child out of the world with dignity. That's also taking care of your child. Parenting.com: And you found a kinship these other mothers of Tay-Sachs children. You call them dragon moms. Rapp: I love those ladies. What's great about this moms' group is that no one is trying to one-up each other, which is a nice relief and change from most parenting groups. They're from all different parts of the world, different economic classes; they're hugely diverse in terms of religion, politics, age, geography. No one talks about things that would normally unite people like church or political affiliations. We talk about ""how do you use a suction machine? Did you use a suction machine?"" It's grim. But it's people sharing ideas about how to make their kids most comfortable and what's best for their kids and how difficult those decisions can be when you're dealing with end-of-life issues. Parenting.com: My special needs baby changed my life for the better . Parenting.com: What did you learn about the nature of grief and illness through Ronan? Rapp: What I learned the most from this experience is that nobody knows anything about anything. There's no norm, there's no right life, there's no right way, there's no right person. All that stuff is completely silly. And it's meant to rank each other on this ladder: if you had a life someone wishes they had, you're a success. Which is stupid. If you're the person doing the envying, you're disregarding the things in your own life. Parenting.com: We all struggle with that grass-is-greener syndrome, fear of missing out. Rapp: It really shattered all of those categories for me. It's not like I'm suddenly some enlightened being. I'm not enlightened at all. I don't have any wisdom, it just made me realize so many of the things I was worried about were so silly. At first it terrified me, but now I find it really liberating. Parenting.com: This book is also about the myths and the stories we construct for ourselves. How do you provide a narrative for a dying baby, for someone who will never be able to even understand his own story? Rapp: A lot of the book is me projecting on him. He was just his own guy. Yes, his life was completely tragic on a biological level. His body did not work in the world. But people were really moved by being with him -- not because it was a sad story, but because he was so present and calm. He never worried, because he didn't know how. He's sort of beyond story and we're left to create a story. But that itself is a story. It's a very weird experience being around a human person who has no ego. It's stunningly different than being around your average toddler. Parenting.com: Living for the day my autistic son speaks . I'd think about it in yoga class, when they say ""put it all out of your mind."" I'd think ""that's Ronan. He's just chillin'."" We try so hard to drop into those moments and it's interesting when we meet a being that does it by his nature. Parenting.com: There is of course a lot of intense sadness and grief in this book, but there are also moments of great joy. Rapp: He would do funny things. He would giggle and have little sighs. He had a personality. Sometimes he would do something that would make me laugh. He was gorgeous and sweet. You could snuggle with him and take him places. All of that was happy. Behind that was this thunderous knowledge and fear of what was going to happen next. You can't bear the second without the first. That's why those moments of elation happen. It's what human beings have to do. At Tay-Sachs conferences, it's the darkest humor you've ever heard. Some people would probably find it offensive. But you have to laugh sometimes, to offload the gargantuan stress that is involved in taking care of a baby who's dying. It sucks. Parenting.com: This book is all about living that knowledge that the end is coming. Now that you're on the other side, is there something you would tell the you who was living in that? Rapp: I would tell the me who was living that that when he died I would be relieved. And I was. I don't know if there's any right way to grieve. But when Ronan was diagnosed, it was like he died on that day. It was like he got hit by a truck. I went through what I think any parent who loses their child suddenly goes through. I was out of my mind. When he died, he was ready to die. Anyone who has witnessed a death or knows someone who died knows that in that final moment the body is unraveling. It will do its thing and you just have to witness it. It's really wrenching but he was really, really sick when he died, and I wanted him to go because I didn't want him to suffer any more. I miss him, but there was nothing for him here. Parenting.com: You finished writing the book before he died, but it was written in past tense. Was that a deliberate choice? Rapp: The blog was written in present tense. I did that because I was writing things as they unfolded. But it felt really breathless to have that in the narrative in present in terms of the craft of the writing. Also I didn't want his death scene to be in the book. If it stayed in present tense it felt like it had to end that way, whereas this is more looking back. Parenting.com: Is there anything you wish parents of healthy children would take away from this book? Rapp: I wish parents of healthy children wouldn't be smug about it. There's something about smug parents that really hacks me off. Parenting.com: Smug how? Rapp: I hear this a lot from parents, and it's like how is this in any way helpful? ""Looking at your life makes me feel blessed."" Which is another way of saying ""I'm glad I'm not you."" Parenting.com: What a horrible thing to say. Rapp: It's disgusting. And what I want to say but don't say is ""you don't know what's going to happen."" I don't wish anyone ill. But you don't know what's going to happen to your children, so you better enjoy them now. They could drown in a pool or get leukemia or shoot themselves in the head when they're 30. People don't want to hear that. But don't look at me and put that sympathy on me, because you don't know when chaos will hit you. And it will. I have a great life. It's a sad, complicated, beautiful, strange life. It's mine. Parenting.com: You say you weren't a parent for very long. You don't feel that once you've been a mother, you're always a mother? Rapp: It rings a little false. I miss my kid. I miss caring for him. Sometimes I'd get a glimpse of who he'd have been if he hadn't been sick and I wanted that kid. And I wanted to see him and meet him and know him. I'm glad I was his mother. I just wish I had been able to be it for longer. Read an excerpt from Emily's book . Get 2 FREE YEARS of Parenting magazine - Subscribe Now!! Copyright 2011 The Parenting Group. All rights reserved.

"(CNN) -- From the top of a 14-meter mast, Delphine Lechifflart expertly rolls down a length of white ribbon, her taut body pirouetting mid-air, before easing into the arms of her lover. The two French acrobats continue to twirl and swoop, their flying silhouettes growing darker as the sun lowers in the sky behind them. It's a sumptuous image that hushes the crowd who stand gathered, not under a circus big top, but on the banks of a jetty. This, of course is no ordinary acrobatic show, but one performed entirely on a lurching 12-meter yacht in harbors across the world. ""They use the whole boat like it's one big gymnastics apparatus,"" said Dwight Jones, manager at Seattle's Elliott Bay Marina, which recently hosted the enchanting La Loupiote show. ""You couldn't ask for a more dramatic stage -- people can watch from the shore or take their own dinghy and see it from the water."" A family affair . For acrobat couple Lechifflart, 42, and Franck Rabilier, 44, their distinctive yellow yacht is not simply a stage -- it's also the floating home they share with two daughters; Loeva, 13, and Ondja, five. ""The eldest has done some shows with us, playing a puppet, but the youngest is still too small,"" said Rabilier. ""We're home-schooling them and at the beginning of each year they go back to France to do their exams."" Since setting sail from Brittany in north west France in 2004, the free-spirited family has traveled from port to port across the globe, performing their remarkable show and surviving on donations alone. ""They just pass a hat around at the end,"" Jones explained. ""People can't believe they're seeing this fantastic performance for free -- it really generates a sense of generosity."" Show time . From rolling down the top of the mast, to balancing on the boom, and tiptoeing along the railing, the agile acrobats leap across every inch of the boat in two very different 20-minute routines. The first is a slapstick Laurel and Hardy-style comedy, featuring two bumbling sailors racing around the yacht to a lolloping piano soundtrack. As the sun sets, the couple perform their second, more romantic show, in which two lovers tenderly cavort mid-air to rousing classical music. ""In the romantic show, there's an orange-pinkish light behind them while they're doing this beautiful ballet in the rigging,"" Jones said. ""They perform the whole thing without a safety net. It's like nothing you've ever seen before -- people were coming back day-after-day to see them."" Setting sail . The daring duo began taking circus lessons while university students in Paris, and in 1999 set up their own acrobatic company called La Loupiote -- meaning ""small light"" in old French. They performed in theaters and on the streets, but had dreams of taking the show on the road -- or more accurately, the high seas. ""We both sailed with our parents when we were young,"" Lechifflart explained. ""That was our dream -- to travel the world by boat."" In 2000 they bought a half-built yacht and spent the next four years getting it into seaworthy shape. Once on the water, the pair spent a year experimenting and refining their unique aquatic-based act. ""The first time we tried it, I had a lot of bruises,"" Lechifflart said. ""It's so much more complicated than working on land."" ""You have to work with the weather, the wind, the waves -- the boat is constantly moving."" Circusnavigation . The family's nomadic lifestyle has taken them across Europe, America, and now New Zealand, where they'll be performing over the next month. And after that, who knows? The carefree couple tend to sail the high-seas in whichever direction they wish, surviving on around $800 a month. ""They're not living high on the hog, as they say, but they're loving what they're doing,"" Jones said. ""Their perspective on life is different from people working nine to five -- they don't know where they're going the next day and you've got to respect that."" And so, like the circus wagons of old, the family of acrobats will point their ""small light"" towards the horizon in search of the next high-flying adventure.","French acrobat family travel the world, perform on 12-meter yacht .

"(CNN) -- A Miami man who shot and killed his wife during a fight at their home in August and allegedly uploaded a picture of her corpse to his Facebook page told police he was defending himself, officials said. ""I'm not a killer,"" Derek Medina said in an August video released Friday by prosecutors. ""I do not feel that I'm guilty and I feel like this was self-defense."" Medina, who has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder, said he and his wife, Jennifer Alonso, were having an argument in the bedroom when ""she started throwing stuff, objects, towards me,"" such as towels, mascara, creams, boxes and shoes. ""Anything in the room she could throw at me,"" said Medina, who told police he had been an amateur boxer with a 25-0 record. "" ....I got hit in the face a few times."" Medina gave these additional details, as outlined in a Miami-Dade Police Department transcript accompanying the video: . At one point, he pulled a gun on his wife and told her to stop. After further discussion, he put the gun away and Alonso told him she was leaving him. They talked again downstairs, where she unloaded a volley of punches on him. He fetched the gun again. She pulled a knife. He wrestled it out of her hands and put it in a drawer. Why people share murder, rape on Facebook . ""She just started throwing punches like crazy. She was like really attacking me,"" he told police. ""Like I was getting out of the way and got hit in the arm and she was like going for my temple."" Medina told police that Alonso threatend to kill him with a knife, but he disarmed her. He told police Alonso also said she would have someone kill him. Medina said as the fight continued, he shot his wife ""six to eight times."" Medina told police he suffered injuries from his wife's pushing and punching. According to authorities, Medina wrote on Facebook, ""Im going to prison or death sentence for killing my wife love you guys miss you guys take care Facebook people you will see me in the news."" The gruesome image of Alonso stayed online and was passed along for at least five hours. Facebook was notified of the content and employees removed the picture and disabled the pages of Medina and his slain wife. An autopsy report released on Thursday said Alonso suffered gunshot wounds to her left forearm. Some of the bullets traveled at a downward angle, with one bullet entering her right chin, lodging in her back at the right side of her ribs. Gunpowder residue was found on her left hand and forearm, and the right side of her neck and chin. Seven bullets and two bullet fragments were recovered.

"(CNN) -- The Guardian is gone. What was left of the former U.S. Navy minesweeper was lifted off a Philippine reef on Saturday. ""The stern was lifted around 1:50 p.m.,"" Philippine Coast Guard Palawan District head Commodore Enrico Efren Evangelista told the state-run Philippine News Agency. It was the last of the four sections of the wood and fiberglass hull the USS Guardian had been cut into in the effort to remove it from where it ran aground on January 17. Bow cut from U.S. ship . The 250-ton stern segment was placed aboard a waiting barge. ""As the hull has been removed, the team is now shifting their effort to collecting minor debris that remains on the reef,"" the head of the salvage operation, Navy Capt. Mark Matthews, said in a statement. ""We also have a collaborative team from the U.S. and the Philippines beginning to assess the condition of the reef."" The Guardian is estimated to have damaged about 4,000 square meters (about 43,000 square feet) of the reef, a UNESCO World Heritage site that is home to about 500 species of fish and 350 species of coral, as well as whales, dolphins, sharks, turtles and breeding seabirds. The Navy has pledged to clean up the debris created when waves stripped off pieces of fiberglass covering the wooden hull of the ship and to try to restore the reef as much as possible. ""(With this complete) the second phase which is the assessment and recovery phase (for the damaged reef) begins,"" Evangelista said. ""Every salvage operation presents unique challenges. It has been difficult to extract the Guardian without causing further damage to the reef, but the U.S. Navy and SMIT salvage team with support from other companies and the government of the Philippines have really done a superb job. I could not be more proud,"" Matthews said. ""We continue to work closely with the Philippine Coast Guard, Navy and Tubbataha Reef Park Rangers, and we are grateful for the support we have received to remove Guardian and minimize further damage to the reef."" An investigation into the grounding is ongoing, but Navy officials said in January that the U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, which prepares the digital navigation charts used by the Navy, has reported the location of the reef was misplaced on a chart by nine miles. While the removal of the stern from the reef may visually mark the end of the Guardian, the ship was officially stricken from the U.S. Navy registry in February. Navy communications now refer to it as the Ex-Guardian. It has been replaced in the Pacific by the USS Warrior, which arrived at the U.S. naval base in Sasebo, Japan, earlier this month. The Guardian's crew will take over operation of the Warrior.","The grounded U.S. Navy minesweeper was removed from a Philippine reef Saturday .

"(CNN) -- Guess that overheating issue isn't such a big deal after all. Less than two weeks after Consumer Reports engineers found that Apple's new tablet can get as hot as 116 degrees while running games, the magazine has declared it the best in breed, placing it at the top of its tablet-computer rankings on Monday. ""The high-resolution screen of the new iPad establishes a new benchmark in excellence, providing the best rendering of detail and color accuracy we've ever seen on a tablet display,"" reviewer Donna L. Tapellini wrote on the Consumer Reports site. The review called the iPad ""superb in virtually every other way as well,"" noting a vastly improved camera, a fast, dependable connection (on Verizon's 4G network), and longer battery life than any other tablet tested by the product-review group. In an earlier test using a thermal-imaging camera, Consumer Reports engineers recorded temperatures up to 13 degrees higher than the iPad 2 on the new iPad while playing a video game, ""Infinity Blade II."" But Monday's report downplayed that. ""(W)e didn't find those temperatures to be cause for concern,"" the report says. Some reports have found the tablet won't recharge while playing power-intensive games, but Consumer Reports' testing showed that problem also to be limited. ""Our high overall judgment of the new iPad was not affected by the results of either battery of tests."" Since the iPad launched in 2010, its sales have dwarfed those of any other tablet. But Consumer Reports did have some praise Monday for some of the Apple juggernaut's competitors. The 10.1-inch Toshiba Excite 10LE was the lightest tablet the group has tested, at a little over one pound, and Pantech's new 8-inch Element tab was praised for its claim of being waterproof. The Sony Tablet P and Samsung's Galaxy Tab 2.2 were also among newly reviewed tablets that earned a recommendation. The iPad wasn't perfect, according to the review. Consumer Reports noted that, in some applications designed for previous models (notably magazines), its high-definition screen magnifies imperfections. But that wasn't enough to knock it out of the top spot. ""On balance, however, the screen quality of the new iPad is a significant plus, especially given the likelihood that content will increasingly rise in resolution to take advantage of it,"" according to the review.","Consumer Reports names the new iPad as its most recommended tablet .

"(CNN) -- You may have noticed something different about your friends' profile pictures as you scrolled through your Facebook feed this week. According to the social networking site, roughly 2.7 million users changed their profile image on Tuesday as the U.S. Supreme Court pondered the future of same-sex marriage in the United States. The Human Rights Campaign started urging people on Monday to change their Facebook profile pictures to a pink-on-red equal sign to show support for same-sex marriage, and soon the top 10 terms trending on Facebook were all related to the subject. To get a better idea of the potential amount of support for same-sex marriage on Facebook, researchers on the Facebook Data Science Team compiled information to find out how many U.S. users changed their profile photo. While the data isn't specific to users changing their profile photos to the several variations of the pink equal sign on top of a red background, variations of the Human Rights Campaign's traditionally blue-and-yellow logo, the Facebook data show that roughly 2.7 million more users updated their profile photo on Tuesday compared with the previous Tuesday, leading the researchers to conclude the HRC appeal had a lot to do with the numbers. Same-sex marriage debate goes viral . ""You always hope that these things will capture the imagination of those that see it,"" Fred Saiz, vice president of communication for the HRC, told CNN Tuesday. ""I think what you can't predict and plan for how individuals with a bigger reach than your own are going to make your reach exponential in nature."" According to Facebook, users around 30 years of age changed their profile pictures the most, in response to the events surrounding the HRC campaign, about 3.5% of 30-year-old Facebook users. Profile updates did not vary significantly based on gender. On average, according to Facebook, 2.3% more self-reported female users changed their profile photos, compared with 2.1% more self-reported males. Where you live also appears to play a role in whether you changed your profile photo this week. Opinion: Gay marriage hasn't won (yet...) Facebook researchers mapped out the profile picture changes showing a fairly broad distribution throughout the country, but certain areas showed greater concentration of support than others. Many of the top 25 counties that showed the greatest support for HRC's campaign were home to college towns, such as Washtenaw County, home of the University of Michigan and at 6.2% the county with the largest increase in profile photo changes, as well as the home counties of the University of North Carolina, Duke University, Indiana University, the University of Colorado and the University of Texas. Major cities also showed large increases in profile photo changes: San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, New York and Washington. The Family Research Council, an organization ""honoring God's design for marriage and celebrating all who have joined together as man and wife,"" also created its own shareable social graphic featuring a man and a woman holding hands. However, such campaigns have been overshadowed on Facebook by the efforts of groups on the other side of the issue. Eytan Bakshy, a researcher on the Facebook Data Science Team believes the data shows the movement has broad support. ""For a long time, when people stood up for a cause and weren't all physically standing shoulder to shoulder, the size of their impact wasn't immediately apparent. But today, we can see the spread of an idea online in greater detail than ever before. That's data well worth finding.""

"(CNN) -- Rodents, piles of manure, uncaged birds and flies too numerous to count were found by investigators at Iowa farms at the heart of the recall of more than half a billion eggs, the Food and Drug Administration reported Monday. Inspection reports released by the FDA noted numerous violations at six farms operated by Wright County Egg and Quality Egg, which are owned by the same family, and three Hillandale Farms locations. The inspections -- conducted in August, after new egg safety rules went into effect -- were launched in response to the nationwide outbreaks of salmonella that have sickened an estimated 1,470 people, according to the FDA. Neither company fully adhered to their Salmonella enteritidis prevention plans, the inspectors said. Federal investigators found salmonella bacteria in chicken feed and in barn and walkway areas at some of the farms, officials said last week. Monday, health officials detailed plans to launch an inspection program of these and other facilities in the coming weeks. On a conference call Monday, FDA officials said they had also found salmonella in water used to wash eggs at a Hillandale facility. They said it is not clear whether the eggs were washed in contaminated water or if the water was sullied by the eggs. ""Regarding the positive finding in the egg wash water, it is important to note that after washing, all the eggs are rinsed with water containing chlorine as an additional sanitation step,"" said Hillandale spokeswoman Julie DeYoung. At some Wright County Egg facilities, federal inspectors found chicken manure in piles up to eight feet high. In other spots, mounds of manure prevented doors from closing, allowing rodents and other animals to possibly come inside, FDA inspectors said. ""The uncaged birds were using the manure [pile] ... to access the egg-laying area."" The report said Quality Egg and Wright County Egg workers did not always wear protective clothing, that birds were in storage and milling facilities, and feed bins had rusted holes and gaps. Inspectors also found maggots, and in some areas, ""live and dead flies were too numerous to count."" Inspections at three Hillandale farms found -- among other things -- rodents and rodent holes, liquid manure leaking into a chicken house and uncaged chickens tracking manure from a manure pit into a caged henhouse, the inspectors said. The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a food safety advocacy group, called the FDA findings ""stomach churning."" FDA officials have said new egg safety rules, which took effect in mid-July after the outbreak began, will greatly reduce the possibility of a similar salmonella outbreak. But the center said the companies didn't properly respond to the rules. ""Both companies involved had been on notice that they needed to meet requirements of the new egg-safety rule for over a year. Instead of finding companies that were ready to meet those requirements, FDA's inspections document companies with long-standing violations and apparently little intention to comply,"" the center said in a statement. ""The decrepit conditions in these henhouses reflect the fact that companies know that FDA inspections are so rare -- even following the adoption of a new safety regulation -- that there is no urgency to fix their buildings and their operations to assure compliance with FDA statutes and regulations."" In a statement, Hillandale said it is committed to addressing all issues raised by the FDA in order to be in ""full compliance as soon as possible,"" so that it can again ship shell eggs. ""We are in the process of responding to the FDA's written report to provide further explanation and clarification of what was observed. Several of the issues had been identified by the facilities prior to FDA's inspection and were already in the process of being addressed during the inspection period. Additionally, some of the issues were immediately corrected as soon as they were identified."" Wright County Egg said ""the vast majority"" of the concerns identified in the FDA report already have been addressed or are being addressed. ""We anticipate the expeditious completion of nearly all remaining items by mid-September,"" the company said in a statement. ""To demonstrate our continued commitment to running our farms in the most responsible manner and to ensuring the safety of the eggs we produce, our team has worked around the clock to address concerns that were raised verbally during FDA's inspection, with many of those being fixed as soon as they were identified. ... ""Members of our farm's management team actively participated alongside FDA officials during daily site inspections, and we have carefully documented details of those inspections."" An FDA spokeswoman on Monday said the inspection reports are ""merely inspectional observations and [do] not outline any compliance or enforcement actions."" She said there would also be inspections at other companies to enforce the regulations. ""While we cannot disclose a list of inspection targets, ... some factors that we will take into consideration in compiling such a list include the size of the farm, the amount of eggs produced, history of violations and connection to previous outbreaks,"" said Siobhan DeLancey. Federal officials pledged Monday to inspect all 600 facilities covered under the new egg rule within the next 15 months. Hillandale's DeYoung said the company would not respond to specifics in the report. ""We have put specific action plans in place to address each issue raised and are implementing those action plans,"" she said. DeYoung also said she does not believe Hillandale is being singled out by federal inspectors.

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- North Korea is showing signs it could be preparing to carry out a new nuclear test, South Korea's Unification Minister Ryoo Kihl-jae said Monday, according to the semi-official South Korean news agency Yonhap. Ryoo made the comment in response to a South Korean lawmaker who cited unspecified reports suggesting there had been an increase in activity near the site of the North's three previous underground nuclear tests, Yonhap reported. The South Korean government had said Sunday that it believes North Korea may test a missile about April 10, citing as an indicator Pyongyang's push for workers to leave the Kaesong Industrial Complex by then. Seoul ""is on military readiness posture,"" South Korea's Blue House spokeswoman Kim Haeng said in a briefing. She said national security chief Kim Jang-soo also based the assessment on North Korea's hint to foreign diplomats in Pyongyang to send personnel out of the country. The Blue House is the office and residence of South Korea's president, similar to the White House in the United States. ""As of now, nothing out of the ordinary has been detected,"" she said on Kim's behalf. ""If limited war is to break out, North Korea should bear in mind that it will receive damages many times over."" In the rising tide of its anger, North Korea's communist government days ago banned the entry of new workers and trucks into Kaesong, which is on its side of the militarily fortified border with the south. Personnel and supplies are running out in the shared manufacturing zone, causing 13 companies to cease production, the South Korean Ministry of Unification said in a statement Sunday. There are 518 people left in Kaesong, with 39 planning to exit Monday. U.S., South Korean officials put off Washington trip . Gen. James Thurman, the top U.S. commander in South Korea, is canceling a trip to Washington this week due to the rising tensions. ""Given the current situation, Gen. Thurman will remain in Seoul next week as a prudent measure,"" a spokesman said. Thurman was to testify before the Senate Armed Services Committee and the House Armed Services Committee. Gen. Jung Seung-jo, South Korea's top military officer, also delayed a trip to Washington, national news agency Yonhap reported. Switzerland offers to host meeting . Switzerland offered Sunday to host a meeting between North and South Korea in hopes of calming tensions. In a statement, the Swiss government condemned North Korea's recent threats and called on all parties to exercise restraint. The Swiss government ""is always ready to contribute to finding a solution, if that is the desire of the parties, for example hosting meetings between them,"" the statement said. The government recently reminded North Korea of its offer, the statement said. Opinion: An accident, then war with North Korea? Scare tactic bluster . Pyongyang's warpath posturing is a scare tactic, Kim said via his spokeswoman. ""North Korea has been coming out with content that makes headlines on news media every day. This is called the 'headline strategy.' "" It is designed to warp public opinion, he said. Kim also said not to be fooled by the South's calm reaction to it. ""A duck will appear peaceful on the surface, but its feet are moving breathlessly under the water,"" he said, describing the Blue House's behavior. Underneath the calm, Seoul's government is working ""restlessly"" but ""harmoniously."" The South will not succumb to scare tactics and rush into any new peace agreements to stop the North's conduct, he added. He admonished North Korea to open a different kind of dialogue. The Korean war ended in 1953 with an armistice agreement, not a peace treaty. Pyongyang has consistently demanded a full peace treaty, and it also wants direct talks with the United States, which Washington has resisted, preferring instead multilateral discussions. Missile test put off . The United States is delaying a long-planned missile test to avoid any misperceptions by North Korea amid mounting tensions, a senior U.S. Department of Defense official said Saturday. Postponing the launch of the Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile, initially scheduled for Tuesday at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, was ""prudent and wise,"" the official said on condition of anonymity. The missile test had nothing to do with North Korea, but the United States decided to hold off ""given recent tensions on the Korean Peninsula,"" the official said. ""The U.S. will conduct another test soon and remains strongly committed to our nuclear deterrence capabilities,"" said the official, who was not authorized to publicly release details of the launch. U.S. reducing rhetoric that feeds North Korean rhetoric . Embassies staying put . Word of the launch delay comes amid bellicose posturing and threats that have grown more dramatic by the day on the Korean Peninsula, including North Korea's warning to foreign diplomats in Pyongyang that if war breaks out, it cannot guarantee their safety. On Friday, officials met with ambassadors to ask whether they needed help evacuating their personnel, several diplomatic missions said. The same concern apparently does not extend to foreign tourists. Amanda Carr, who works for a British travel company, wrapped up a pleasure tour of North Korea with a group of 20 tourists Saturday. Before leaving the country, they were able to take in a rally in Pyongyang. The British Embassy in North Korea gave her company, Koryo Tours, some guidance in light of the international tensions. ""We've been advised to continue with the tours,"" Carr said. Her North Korean partners -- from the state's travel agency -- continue to accept tourists, she said. And their demeanor is friendly, as it always has been. Russia, a traditional ally of North Korea's, may consider an evacuation of staff because of the tensions, Russian state media said. The Swedish Embassy will remain open. It represents the concerns of the United States in North Korea and helps its citizens traveling there. British, French and German diplomats also have no immediate plans to leave. Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry will visit Asia next week and is expected to discuss potential diplomatic incentives for North Korea once it stops its threatening rhetoric, senior administration officials told CNN on condition of anonymity. ""Secretary Kerry agrees that we have to have a robust deterrent because we really don't know what these guys will do,"" said one senior official, who was not authorized to speak on the issue. ""But he also knows that the North Koreans need a diplomatic off-ramp and that they have to be able to see it."" Key dates in U.S. military moves near North Korea . Missile tension . New reports of missile movements in North Korea have triggered military counteractions by South Korea and the United States. South Korea's semiofficial Yonhap news agency reported that the missiles were ready to launch, citing military sources in Seoul. They are probably Musudan missiles, U.S. officials said. They would have a 2,500-mile range and could threaten South Korea, Japan and Southeast Asia. It is believed that a North Korean missile launch would be a ""test"" launch rather than a targeted strike. A U.S. official told CNN that two medium-range missiles have been loaded onto mobile launchers on the east coast of North Korea, but a second U.S. official said intelligence on that is not definitive. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to publicly speak on the issue. In response, South Korea has sent Aegis destroyers equipped with advanced radar systems to both of its coasts, Yonhap said, citing navy sources. The United States will deploy missile defense systems to Guam, a Western Pacific territory that is home to U.S. naval and air bases. North Korea has cited those bases when listing possible targets for missile attacks. North Korea: Our global fear and fascination . CNN's Ben Brumfield reported from Atlanta; CNN's K.J.

"(CNN) -- Florida A&M drum major Robert Champion walked into the darkness of Bus C in a parking lot in Orlando, Florida, last fall in the hope of gaining respect from his fellow band members. On November 19, Champion and the rest of the band were in Orlando for the Florida Classic football game, the last game of the football season. It would be Champion's last chance of the year to endure the ""cross over,"" the name for the process of being fully initiated into the band. According to witnesses, Champion first endured a pummeling with fists and bass drum mallets as he sat in what the band describes as the ""hot seat."" The drum major then would have to ""cross over,"" making his way through a gauntlet of punches, drumsticks and mallets toward the back of the bus. The bus rocked back and forth violently as other band members lined the aisle, witnesses said, with some grabbing onto his body, trying to keep him from reaching the back of the bus, a signal that he'd made it through. Champion eventually would make it to the point where he could touch his hand to the back wall, but he would never make it back to his hotel. Champion, 26, died last year because of ""hemorrhagic shock due to soft tissue hemorrhage, due to blunt force trauma,"" the Orange County medical examiner said. More than 2,000 pages of police interviews with witnesses and defendants who were aboard the bus on the day of Champion's death paint the first full blow-by-blow account of what happened on the night they say Champion and two others were hazed. Florida A&M band fraternity charter revoked after hazing investigation . Champion's roommate Keon Hollis told police that the initiation process went against everything that the drum major believed in. Champion didn't want to go through with it, but decided he had to in order to earn respect, Hollis told police. ""If you want to be somebody you have to do it,"" band member Ryan Dean said. Hollis had taken a shot of alcohol before heading down to the bus that night with Champion. Lissette Sanchez, one of the female band members, was first to run through the gantlet. She had also earlier endured a beating in the ""hot seat,"" a ritual which band members said usually happened three times on different occasions before you could ""cross over."" FAMU's band director steps down amid hazing death controversy . ""You're bent over and they just like play cadences on your back,"" band member Evan Calhoun told police about the ""hot seat."" Others described the ""hot seat"" beatings as more intense on other occasions. They said a band member would sit, head between his or her knees, be covered with a blanket to make it impossible to see, and then be beaten with drumsticks or bass drum mallets for a few minutes. Upperclassmen in charge of organizing the ritual are normally packed into the back of the bus, making that the most brutal part of the gantlet, band members said. The older members instructed others not to hit Sanchez near the kidneys during the gantlet, because she suffered from medical problems. Sanchez said she was ""basically unconscious"" after the routine. As she sat in the back of the bus recovering, it was time for Keon Hollis to face the group. ""It was a lot of people. It was really dark on the bus,"" Hollis told police. ""It had to be at least maybe like 15 people."" Hollis began the process, as others had, by taking off his shirt in preparation for the ritual. He said that as he struggled to get past the band members, he was slapped with open hands, beaten with straps and a comb, and kicked. He then stayed at the back of the bus, trying to regain his composure and breathing after being winded. When he walked back to the front of the bus, before vomiting in the parking lot, his fellow band members hollered and clapped in celebration -- a signal that he had truly completed the initiation. Then, it was time for Champion, who as a drum major was subject to a bit more pummeling, some fellow band members said. Since drum majors were considered to be the police of the band, it wasn't surprising if someone snuck in a shot while they had a chance. Band member Benjamin McNamee said that Champion was prepped before his run, hit in the chest before he ran the gantlet. One band member described Champion as looking anxious right before the initiation. Harold Finley said right before Champion made his way through the crowd, someone shouted to ""send the n****r through."" As he made his way past each member, he was hit and punched. Some people tried to help push him through, while at least one girl tried to hold him back, the way a linebacker would, to make the gantlet more difficult, band members said. At least one person tried to climb over several seats to get another shot at him. ""When that person gets to you, I mean, you can choose to do whatever you want,"" Finley said. Band member Ryan Dean said he was trying to shout words of encouragement as the drum major made his way through punches. ""I was just yelling, 'Go! Come on, man, you can do it,'"" he said. At one point Champion fell down into one of the seats. One band member was ""holding into the rails and kind of just jumping up and down"" while Champion was lying in that seat, according to the documents. Someone also grabbed him in a bear hug before Champion pushed through and made his way to about two feet from the end of the bus. ""I see people are kicking him,"" band member Jonathan Boyce told police. ""So I grab him to try and keep everybody off of him. I put my body around his body."" When Champion finished the ritual, Boyce sat him down on the floor of the bus. He asked for some water, and Boyce gave him a Gatorade. He seemed fine at that moment, right after the ritual, Boyce said. After all three members had passed the initiation, many of the band members got off the bus and headed back toward the hotel. That's when Champion started to panic, Boyce said. ""He was having trouble breathing ... and like he couldn't see but his eyes were open,"" Boyce said. Champion passed out and Boyce said he checked for a pulse. The drum major still had a pulse and was still breathing, so Boyce went upstairs to get someone else to help. Soon after he left, Boyce got a call that Champion was no longer breathing. Band member Marcus Fabre told police that around that time, he heard that after senior band members found out Champion was not moving, they panicked. ""The upperclassmen that initiated the hazing went around the hotel asking for alcohol to rub down (Champion's) body - take off fingerprints,"" he said he was told. A few band members began doing CPR on the drum major. ""They was calling his name and (Champion) wasn't saying anything,"" band member Darryl Cearnel said. As Cearnel did CPR, others went into the hotel to look for an automated electronic defibrillator. ""He started vomiting when I was giving chest compressions,"" Cearnel said. Paramedics showed up soon after, took over compressions and rushed Champion to the hospital. Many of the students said that late that night they began receiving calls or texts that Champion had died. They frantically struggled to figure out exactly what had happened. Almost all of the band members said they never had any intention of injuring Champion or swore they hadn't directly taken part in the beating. Last of 11 charged with felony hazing in FAMU case turns herself in . Four students were expelled from the school, and another 30 were dismissed from the band soon after Champion's death. A law enforcement investigation resulted in charges being brought against 13 people. Eleven individuals each face one count of third-degree felony hazing resulting in death. Each is also accused of two counts of first-degree misdemeanor hazing. State law provides a prison term of up to six years for those facing the more serious charges. Two people each face a single count of misdemeanor first-degree hazing. Sentences in such cases typically call for up to a year in jail. FAMU said it has taken steps to eradicate the problem, and after Champion died the university's board of trustees approved an anti-hazing plan that includes an independent panel of experts to investigate hazing allegations.","Witnesses paint violent blow-by-blow account of Robert Champion's hazing .

"(CNN) -- The legendary Hanging Gardens of Babylon are the inspiration behind an ambitious plan to grow a rooftop forest high above Beirut's crowded streets. The cityscape is currently overshadowed by concrete highrises, with parkland making up just 3% of Lebanon's capital, according to a study by the American University of Beirut. The lack of greenery has contributed to poor air quality and trapped heat, among a host of other environmental issues, claims architect Wassim Melki. This led him to the the unconventional idea of greening over the city's rooftops. ""We want to cover the top of nearly every building in the city with trees,"" said Melki. Challenging though it sounds, Melki's proposal does not involve complicated drainage systems or engineering. ""We're just talking about planting small to medium-sized trees in relatively large pots and securing them to the roofs,"" he added. The 28-year-old architect claims there are 15,000 suitable rooftops -- around 80% of those in the city. ""Even planting just one on each would result in as many trees as there are in New York's Central Park,"" he said. With colleagues at local NGO ReAct, Melki aims to plant 60,000 trees eventually. They say that as well as making a sizable dent in the level of carbon dioxide in the air, the trees would also create a rooftop canopy, casting shadows on the streets and helping to keep the city cool. Nevertheless, Wonder Forest, if realized, would not be comparable to a public park. ""Planting trees in the ground is always preferable, and nothing can replace a wide open space to walk through,"" said Melki. Comment: Would you give the scheme your support? Is the Wonder Forest project a feasible and much needed innovation or a pretty but impractical pipe dream? Tell us you thoughts in the comments section below. Melki estimates the total cost of the project at $3.5-4 million and is currently lobbying for the Wonder Forest via NGO ReAct and a Facebook page. Ultimately though, the success of the idea is in the hands of Beirut's residents -- who would need to tend the gardens, particularly over the hot summer months. ""Even if all the trees and their installation is provided, if the residents don't subsequently get involved, then the plan will fail,"" said Melki. There could also be benefits for the green fingered, says Melki, who could turn a profit growing and selling olives and citrus fruits, which thrive in Beirut's Mediterranean climate.

"(CNN) -- One talking point frequently used by Republicans to justify shutting down the government while trying to overturn the Affordable Care Act is that the House and its Republican majority are more representative of Americans' views than President Barack Obama and the Democratic Senate. That is preposterous and beside the point. The ACA is law. End of story. The House Republicans' attempt to nullify a duly-enacted law violates the norms of our constitutional system. It is reckless economically and an egregious affront to our democratic form of government. House Republicans have every right to press their views in Congress but not to threaten to blow up the U.S. and global economy by shutting down the government and threatening public default . We have elections for all three key players -- the president, the House and the Senate. If Republicans want to change the law, they must do it the old-fashioned way: Persuade the others to accept their position or win control of the White House and Senate. House Republicans lost ground in the 2012 elections, lost the national vote for the House by over a million votes and retained a majority only because of favorable districting. Obama won re-election by 3.9 percentage points and got an overwhelming victory in the Electoral College. Senate Democrats retained their majority despite having to defend more than twice as many seats as the Republicans. House Republicans represent a distinct minority of public sentiment. They carelessly generalize from the echo chambers of their safe districts to the national electorate. Polls show a majority of the public opposed to shutting down the government to kill or amend Obamacare. A majority of Americans also oppose its repeal or defunding. Moreover, a significant portion of those who don't like the law say it doesn't go far enough. But public opinion doesn't matter at this point. The Constitution provides for an orderly process of making laws and building agreement between chambers of Congress and branches of government. Blackmail, extortion, hostage-taking and brinksmanship are the tools of terrorists, not legislators. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Thomas Mann.","Thomas Mann: GOP talking point is that the House reflects Americans' views .

"London (CNN) -- A designer has come up with a unique and futuristic solution for speeding up rail travel: he doesn't want to change the engines, or the tracks -- he wants to get rid of the stations. Determined to take rail transport into the 21st century, Paul Priestman, director of British design group Priestmangoode, is the man behind the ""Moving Platforms"" concept, which he believes could potentially revolutionize the rail industry. His scheme would see travelers served by a carousel of trams and high-speed trains that would take passengers from their homes to their destinations without them ever having to use a bus, car or taxi. ""The idea with Moving Platforms is that ... if you were going on holiday or on business for instance, you could get onto a tram on your street and then seamlessly travel from that onto the high-speed line and then get off at your destination in another city, then onto a tram and then end up at your destination without ever having gone in your car or perhaps got on a bus,"" says Priestman. ""It's totally integrated into a sort of larger transport system,"" he adds. The idea is to have a city-wide network of trams that travel in a loop and connect with a high-speed rail service. Read more: How green is HSR? But instead of passengers having to get off the tram at a rail station and wait for the next HSR service to arrive, the moving tram would ""dock"" with a moving train, allowing passengers to cross between tram and train without either vehicle ever stopping. ""The trams speed up and the high-speed train slows down and they join, so they dock at high speed,"" explains Priestman. ""They stay docked for the same amount of time that it would stop at a station,"" he adds. ""There are big doors, there are wide doors, they're all the same level so you can seamlessly go between the two vehicles quite peacefully; there's no hurry. ""Then, when everyone's done that, the doors shut and then the trains separate and the tram then goes back into the city or town and picks up more passengers and drops off passengers."" Instead of using paper tickets to pass through a barrier, passengers would used an RFID (radio-frequency identification) system to transfer from tram to train. Similar systems that let passengers scan pre-paid smartcards are already used on many public transport networks. While Priestman admits that it will be some time before his vision could be implemented, he says the time has come to rethink how we travel. ""This idea is a far-future thought but wouldn't it be brilliant to just re-evaluate and just re-think the whole process?"" he says.","""Moving Platforms"" is an integrated tram-to-train concept .

"(CNN) -- Two weeks after Apple announced a new iPad Mini, shoppers looking to snap one up for the holidays -- or just for themselves -- are no closer to knowing when the tablet might hit stores. There was no word Tuesday on a release date for the updated version of Apple's tinier tablet, four days after its larger sibling, the new iPad Air, went on sale. When the two new tablets were unveiled last month, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the new Mini, with a speedier processor and the same high-definition ""retina display"" as its bigger cousins, would be released ""later in November."" Speculation -- and when is even the most minor of Apple releases not preceded with flurries of speculation? -- has begun to center on November 22 as a likely release date. Apple tends to release new products on Fridays, giving them a full weekend to rack up sales while excitement is high. Waiting a week later than the 22nd would have the Mini released on Black Friday, when it would face an avalanche of competition as virtually everyone in the electronics field will be offering post-Thanksgiving sales. Also, Hanukkah is uncharacteristically early this year, beginning on November 27, the same day as Thanksgiving. To take full advantage of the holiday gift-buying season, Apple would want the new tablet on shelves before then. Adding to the speculation, a product listing on Target's website recently listed the release date for the iPad Mini as November 21, although that date appears to have since been removed. Apple did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment for this story. Whenever the iPad Mini arrives, supplies of the device may be limited at first. Early reports said the tablet would be delayed because of a shortage of its new, high-definition display screens. More recently, it's been reported that Apple has turned to rival Samsung for help cranking out the screens in time for a holiday rollout. Japan's Nikkei (Google Translate version) reported that the Mini displays from the Korean tech company wouldn't be available until next year, though. Apple says the new Pad Mini will come in two colors: silver or space gray. Prices will range from $399 for a Wi-Fi-only, 16GB model to $829 for a 128GB model with cellular connectivity.","No release date for the second-generation iPad Mini has been announced .

"(CNN) -- The gun lobby is fiercely, and so far successfully, blocking what easily could be the greatest technological breakthrough to catching killers and deterring others. The simple method allows bullet manufacturers to stamp a numeric code on shell casings that would make it very easy to identify the gun that fired the shot. But the National Rifle Association is lobbying against states enacting laws to require such ""microstamping."" The gun lobby is likely to prevail, given that in 2008 -- for the first time in American legal history -- the Supreme Court interpreted that the Second Amendment guaranteed an individual's right to own guns for personal use, rather than as the tools of a ""well-regulated militia."" The 2008 case, championed by the NRA, was the District of Columbia v Heller. The Supreme Court then struck down a strict D.C. law banning handgun ownership. This, and a subsequent ruling in 2010, effectively tied the hands of state and federal governments in enacting any reasonable gun-related laws. In 2008, Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the typical 5 to 4 conservative majority, argued the first clause of the Second Amendment -- ""A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state"" -- merely offered one reason the founders sought to maintain the right to own firearms and that the main clause ""codified a pre-existing right."" The decision was ""a radical break from 70 years of Supreme Court precedent,"" according to an op-ed in The New York Times. Although Heller applied only to federal law, the 2010 decision in McDonald v. Chicago asserted that the individual right to bear arms is a fundamental right, and thus the court's ruling in Heller could apply to strike down state and local laws as well. ""Never in history has a federal court invalidated a law regulating the private ownership of firearms on Second Amendment grounds,"" said none other than Erin N. Griswold, solicitor general in the Nixon administration and former dean of Harvard Law School. ""Indeed, that the Second Amendment poses no barrier to strong gun laws is perhaps the most well-settled proposition in American constitutional law."" Opinion: Don't be nosy about Fast and Furious . The key Supreme Court cases establishing the precedent are United States v. Cruikshank (1875), Presser v. Illinois (1886), Miller v. Texas (1894) and United States v. Miller (1939). Though the details of these cases vary, and like all such cases they are subject to different readings, the decisions reached in all of them fundamentally affirm that the Constitution does not limit the states' ability to restrict private gun ownership. In United States v. Miller, the case most often cited, Jack Miller had not properly registered his sawed-off shotgun, nor had he paid a tax for transporting this weapon in interstate commerce, both required under the 1934 Firearms Act. Miller claimed the act violated his Second Amendment rights. The court ruled that because Miller could not prove that his shotgun had ""some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well-regulated militia, we cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument.""In the 1875 case, United States v. Cruikshank, members of the Ku Klux Klan were charged with infringing on black citizens' right to bear arms. The court ruled that although the Constitution prevents the government from infringing on that right, it does not apply to citizens' interactions with one another and charged that ""'bearing arms for a lawful purpose'... is not a right granted by the Constitution."" Presser v. Illinois (1886) reaffirmed the court's ruling in Cruikshank. In this case, participants in a paramilitary organization were arrested for conducting parades and weapons drills without permission. The court ruled that states have the right to prohibit citizens from forming private militias and that the Second Amendment ""is one of the amendments that has no other effect than to restrict the powers of the national government,"" meaning that state governments are free to legislate as they choose regarding guns. Similarly, in Miller v. Texas (1894), regarding a man who was convicted of murder with an unlicensed handgun, the court ruled that the Second Amendment does not apply to state laws, calling it ""well settled"" that the Second Amendment ""operate[s] only upon the federal power and [has] no reference whatsoever to proceedings in state courts."" The United States has more gun-related deaths than any other industrialized country. The rate of gun-related death in the United States is more than double that of the next-highest industrialized country and eight times more than the average of its economic peers, according to data from the University of Pennsylvania's Firearms and Injury Center. The U.S. firearms mortality rate is more than 70 times higher than industrialized Asian countries, like Japan, Singapore and Taiwan. An average of 32,300 Americans died each year from gun-related injuries between 1980 and 2006. Among the many victims are children whose parents own guns to protect themselves against intruders. As someone who has experience using guns, I suggest that most homemakers are more likely to be killed in a gunbattle with an intruder than to kill him. It is ridiculous to argue that criminals kill people, not guns. Nor could Seung-Hui Cho have killed 32 people and injured 18 others at Virginia Tech with a knife instead of handguns. I realize that the majority of the Supreme Court is a conservative one and that the court very rarely reverses itself. However, this law enables the gun lobby to promote extreme positions. Is it too much to even hope that justices might revisit the 2008 decision and do what is right -- establish that the government has not just a right but a duty to regulate guns and ammunition? Then we might even get the gun lobby to drop its opposition to stamping a tiny numeric code on shell casings. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Amitai Etzioni.","Amitai Etzioni: Stamping code on shell casings makes it easy for police to ID gun that fired shot .

"Berlin (CNN) -- Germany's constitutional court has strengthened the rights of gay and lesbian couples, giving them a same tax benefit as heterosexual married couples. The ruling, which came Wednesday, comes as the country is mired in an escalating debate on the status of homosexual partnerships. The court ruled that gay couples who have entered into a ""registered partnership,"" the German legal phrase for relationships similar to marriage, must be exempted from the country's land transfer tax just like straight married couples, according to a court news release. The verdict comes as Germany's politicians are generally debating taxation for same-sex couples. Angela Merkel's governing conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) has traditionally been against tax equality for homosexual partnerships. But recently, 13 members of the party called for an expansion of tax rights for same-sex couples. The group wrote that it feels it is not acceptable that ""politics time and again has to be ordered by the constitutional court to abolish inequalities."" Kristina Schroder, Germany's minister for family affairs and also a member of the CDU, has signaled support for the push, saying, ""the suggestion comes at exactly the right time. In homosexual partnerships, people take long-term responsibility for each other. They are living conservative values,"" she told German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung. However, more conservative members of the CDU have voiced concern about the matter, and German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said at a recent news conference that he does not see an urgent need to revise the country's tax laws. Vicious criticism has come from the Christian Social Union, the Bavarian sister party of Merkel's CDU, which is also part of Germany's federal government. ""The marriage of man and woman is under special protection because it is fundamentally oriented toward creating new life. This is not the case in homosexual relationships,"" the CSU's whip in Germany's parliament, Gerda Hasselfeldt, told ARD television. The third partner in Germany's governing coalition, the Liberal Democrats, have long been fighting for tax equality for homosexual couples. In a statement on its website, the party says it welcomes additional members of Merkel's party joining its ranks in the debate. German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle, the former head of the Liberal Democrats, has recently come out as being gay. He lives in a registered partnership with his partner, Michael Mronz. The German government, then under Social Democratic Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, passed a law in August 2001 to create registered partnerships that gave homosexual couple rights similar to those of married couples. But gays and lesbians still face tax inequalities, especially in the field of income taxes. Germany's constitutional court also has cases pending against Germany's current treatment of gays and lesbians in the income tax system.","Ruling comes as the country is mired in a debate on gay rights .

"(CNN) -- In anger over the recent death of an Internet activist who faced federal charges, hackers claiming to be from the group Anonymous threatened early Saturday to release sensitive information about the U.S. Department of Justice. They claimed to have one such file on multiple servers ready for immediate release. The hackers hijacked the website of the U.S. government agency responsible for federal sentencing guidelines, where they posted a message demanding the United States reform its justice system or face incriminating leaks to select news outlets. The lengthy, eloquently written letter was signed ""Anonymous."" Richard McFeely, executive assistant director of the FBI's Criminal, Cyber, Response, and Services Branch, said the bureau was immediately aware of the threat and is ""handling it as a criminal investigation."" ""We are always concerned when someone illegally accesses another person('s) or government agency's network,"" he said. The U.S. Sentencing Commission said its website was brought down ""temporarily"" before it was restored later Saturday. ""The commission's publications, training materials and federal sentencing statistics are again readily accessible to visitors to the site,"" it said in a statement. The suicide of Internet activist Aaron Swartz on January 11 triggered the posting of the hackers' message to the web address of the sentencing commission, they said. His death, which they blamed on the justice system, ""crossed a line,"" the letter said. How Aaron Swartz helped build the Internet . A YouTube video accompanied the message, and made use of images from Cold War nuclear scenarios and games of strategy. The letter contained nuclear metaphors to refer to chunks of embarrassing information. The hackers said they have obtained ""enough fissile material for multiple warheads,"" which it would launch against the Justice Department and ""its associated executive branches."" It gave the ""warheads"" the names of U.S. Supreme Court justices. 'Anonymous' threatens Westboro Baptist . Anonymous accused the FBI of infiltrating its ranks and claimed the federal government is applying ""highly disproportionate sentencing"" to ruin the lives of some of its members. Swartz, 26, was facing federal computer fraud charges and could have served 35 years in prison. Anonymous said he ""was killed,"" because he ""faced an impossible choice."" His family has issued a statement saying that federal charges filed over allegations that he stole millions of online documents contributed to Swartz's decision to take his own life. The files were mostly scholarly papers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Opinion: Why the Net grieves Aaron Swartz . Swartz's suicide has inspired a flurry of online tributes and mobilized Anonymous, the loosely defined collective of so-called ""hacktivists"" who oppose attempts to limit Internet freedoms. Both Swartz and Anonymous have been stark proponents of open access to information and open-source programming. A review of a cached version of the USSC.gov website showed the Anonymous message on its homepage early Saturday. Anonymous also posted an editable version of the website, inviting users to deface it as they pleased. Multiple pages -- not only the home page -- appeared to allow users to alter them. The ""warhead"" names appeared as links, most leading to 404 error messages of pages not found, but some leading to pages of raw programming code.

"(CNN) -- As the director of ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" Nos. 1, 2 and 3, filmmaker Gore Verbinski is intimately familiar with the massive needs of a potential summer blockbuster. The explosions have to be bigger; the scenes more captivating; the action sequences more believable and awe-inspiring. ""I think every director who's making a big movie this summer has gone through the same thing,"" Verbinski told CNN's Nischelle Turner. ""That's what audiences expect, and you've gotta be really entertaining. It's competition."" On July 3, Verbinski will enter the summer box office race not with pirates, but cowboys. With Jerry Bruckheimer producing (as he's done with the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise, among several other top Hollywood titles), Verbinski has enlisted Armie Hammer and ""Pirates"" star Johnny Depp to help him reinvent and tell the origin story of the masked seeker of justice. ""The Lone Ranger,"" which just released its fourth trailer on Wednesday, was shot over five months across Colorado, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico and California. It was a strenuous, stressful undertaking as the crew pulled 18-hour days in places such as Rio Puerco, a location so arid ""we're still getting dust out of our ears and nose and eyes,"" Verbinski said. ""Nobody understands how difficult it is actually to do it,"" Bruckheimer added. ""The grueling hours, the lack of sleep. [Verbinski's] always looking for another location -- he lost a location, he's got to shoot something else the next day, an actor's sick. ... It's just unbelievable that you're running this thing for a number of months and you're moving an army five states."" All in the name of the summer blockbuster. And the locations, which were painful but necessary to endure given that ""The Lone Ranger"" is a Western, were just half the challenge. Verbinski, it seems, wasn't willing to settle for a fake locomotive -- those trains you see roaring through the TV spots were man-made. ""Everything is real,"" Bruckheimer said. ""Gore doesn't like to do it with the visual effects, so those guys are really on the train, the train is actually moving, it's not a CG shot -- so everything you see here is real. So it had to be built. You can't imagine how many people it takes just to keep the train running; to get the stunt guys to keep the guys on top of the train; the rigging so they're all safe and the amount of extras [to be] the people in the background; it's just a lot."" Is it any wonder that, on a scale of difficulty ranging from 1-10, Verbinski puts making ""The Lone Ranger"" at an ""11""? ""Eleven, definitely. This is the hardest movie,"" Verbinski said. ""I mean, hats off to ['Stagecoach,' 'Searchers' director] John Ford and ['Once Upon a Time in the West' director] Sergio [Leone] and all those kinds who make these Westerns because they're really hard. I mean we all know what a train looks like and we all know what horses look like and it's not a giant robot or a flying saucer, so what are you going to [do], put someone against a blue screen?"" That's not to say that the popcorn sci-fi flicks are more forgiving, because ""there are no easy movies -- those movies are really hard too,"" Verbinksi said. ""But we know what that [Western] reality looks like, there's a whole language that's been established about what we know and feel from real horses and real dirt and real trains, and they're hard movies. This movie has Comanche and cavalry and trains, and we went and shot in five states. It's a big movie."" But by now, ""big"" is just what we expect from Verbinski, and especially when paired with Bruckheimer, and they're hoping ""The Lone Ranger"" will come across as an explosive, fresh take on a familiar story. ""[Verbinski] makes big movies and that's what audiences love and that's why summer movies become blockbusters, because you give them a lot of punch for their 10 or 12 bucks,"" Bruckheimer said. ""[We're] reinventing the tale of the Lone Ranger, but starting with the origin. It's the origin story, told through Tonto's point of view, who's not quite accurate with what he remembers, so it's a lot of fun."" Johnny Depp's latest movie projects .

"(CNN) -- Something didn't look right. David Henneberry had been cooped up for hours, stuck inside as police searched for a suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings. He ventured out for some fresh air after police lifted their order to stay indoors. He looked at the boat parked in his yard. What he saw brought an end to the authorities' sweeping manhunt. It would lead them to a fugitive, who was hiding on the floor of his boat. ""The tarp on his winterized boat had sort of been flapping in the wind,"" his stepson Robert Duffy told CNN's Piers Morgan. 'A million questions' for suspect . Henneberry had tied down the covering on the vessel in his backyard so firmly that it had not budged all winter long, not even through this year's blizzards. ""He got closer and realized that one of the retention straps had literally been cut -- not chafed, not broken or unhooked,"" Duffy said. Henneberry saw something else -- something on the tarp that looked like blood. The Watertown resident thought some animal had forced its way into his boat. Maybe it was a squirrel, he told his stepson. Henneberry climbed a stepladder to look inside. ""He basically stuck his head under the tarp (and) noticed a pool of blood,"" Duffy said. WATCH: 5 days in 3 minutes . 'Crumpled up in a ball' It was dark under the tarpaulin, so the boat owner could only make out vague contours, ""but he definitely noticed there was something crumpled up in a ball,"" the stepson said. A pool of blood; a manhunt in Watertown; time to call 911. Squad cars with lights flashing raced in and lined the streets. Officers fanned out around the house. Police whisked the Henneberrys so hastily from harm's way and into a neighbor's house that the couple left their cell phones behind at home. Brothers hoped to start new life in U.S. Frantic phone calls . Duffy said he tried frantically to call his mother and stepfather as he watched on TV while law officers unleashed a hailstorm of gunfire into the backyard. ""We only saw the bullets; we only heard that there was a man covered in blood in the boat."" His stepfather, Duffy thought. He kept dialing. As Boston reeled, younger suspect partied . The couple's landline gave him a constant busy signal. ""It was absolutely horrifying for approximately 40 minutes,"" Duffy said. He drove over to a relative's house to see if the phone lines worked better from there. As soon as he arrived, his sister called him. ""Mom's called, they're safe,"" she comforted him. ""At that point, my tears of horror went to tears of joy,"" Duffy said. WATCH: Final moments of standoff . An end to the hunt . Henneberry's call to police put an end to the hunt for the man suspected of planting one of two bombs that exploded near the finish line of the Boston Marathon, killing three and inflicting injuries on dozens more that are typical of wounds sustained in conflict regions such as Afghanistan and Iraq. Before police stopped him, Dzhokar Tsarnaev, with his older brother, Tamerlan, allegedly shot a university policeman dead, hijacked a car at gunpoint, then fired upon and threw grenades at officers pursuing them. Police shot and killed the brother, but Dzhokar Tsarnaev eluded them all day Friday -- until Henneberry's 911 call. Before opening fire, authorities, using a bullhorn, called on the younger Tsarnaev to surrender. A standoff followed. When it finally ended and police approached the boat, they were aware of the danger the armed man posed. Unlike Henneberry, they used a robot to pull back the tarp over the boat.

"Washington (CNN) -- A majority of justices raised questions in oral arguments Wednesday about the federal Defense of Marriage Act, indicating the Supreme Court may strike down a key part of the law that denies legally married same-sex couples the same benefits provided to heterosexual spouses. A ruling is expected within three months on the constitutionality of the 1996 law that defines marriage for federal purposes as only between one man and one woman. Wednesday's arguments concluded two days of presentations before the high court on one of the most prevalent social issues of this era -- the right of gay and lesbian couples to wed and receive the full benefits of law provided to heterosexual couples. Afterward, Edith ""Edie"" Windsor, 83, stood on the steps of the courthouse -- near the ""Equal Justice Under Law"" slogan engraved above -- and proclaimed something she hid for decades before her challenge against the act known as DOMA. ""I am today an out lesbian, OK, who just sued the United States of America, which is kind of overwhelming for me,"" she said. She had just watched almost two hours of oral arguments before the nation's highest court on how she had to pay higher estate taxes than someone in a heterosexual marriage. Windsor tried to explain to reporters why she and her late spouse, Thea Spyer, married in New York when the law allowed it after decades together. 16 brave and humorous signs on same-sex marriage . Marriage, she said, is ""a magic word, for anyone who doesn't understand why we want it and why we need it."" ""We did win in the lower court,"" Windsor added, then later predicted: ""I think it's gonna be good."" Under DOMA, Social Security, pension and bankruptcy benefits, along with family medical leave protections and other federal provisions, do not apply to gay and lesbian couples legally married in states that recognize such unions. Windsor was forced to assume an estate tax bill much larger than heterosexual married couples would have to pay. Because her decades-long partner was a woman, the federal government did not recognize their same-sex marriage in legal terms, even though their home state of New York did. ""What kind of marriage is that?"" The court appeared divided along ideological lines during the arguments about whether DOMA is discriminatory and steps on state marriage laws for gays and lesbians. If legally married homosexuals were being denied more than 1,100 federal benefits, ""what kind of marriage is that?"" asked Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who said the discriminatory effect is ""pervasive."" ""What gives the federal government the right to define marriage?"" asked Justice Sonia Sotomayor. The potential swing vote, Justice Anthony Kennedy, also questioned the reach of DOMA, saying it presents a ""real risk of running into traditional state police power to regulate marriage."" Kennedy's point caused court observers to speculate he would join the four normally liberal-leaning justices to create a majority against the act. On the other side, Chief Justice John Roberts repeatedly asked whether it would step on state power to do the opposite of DOMA -- pass a law providing full federal benefits to any legally married same-sex couple. Same-sex marriage and DOMA: 5 things we learned from oral arguments . When Windsor's lawyer argued in court there was a ""sea change"" afoot today in support of same-sex marriage that leaves DOMA outdated, Roberts said that is because of ""the political effectiveness of those on your side"" swaying public opinion. Roberts and Justice Antonin Scalia also suggested DOMA could still remain in place as a valid extension of congressional authority, as 41 states do not allow same-sex marriage. Paul Clement, the high-profile lawyer hired by House Speaker John Boehner and fellow Republican legislators to defend DOMA, suggested the act was passed as a ""cautious approach"" in response to initial efforts in some states to change state marriage laws to include homosexuals. ""In 1996 something was happening"" in the country, Clement said, adding that Congress wanted to created uniformity in the federal sphere and not sow confusion in states that did not want same-sex marriage. However, Justice Elena Kagan drew an audible gasp from the packed courtroom by quoting from the official House reports of 17 years ago, when legislators stated one reason to pass DOMA was to ""express moral disapproval"" over gays and lesbians being allowed to wed. It was not until 2004 that Massachusetts became the first state to legalize same-sex marriage. No consensus was reached from the bench on the gateway or jurisdictional questions -- whether House Republicans were on solid legal footing when they stepped in and defended the law after President Barack Obama and his Justice Department reversed their position by concluding DOMA was unconstitutional. The administration changed its mind after initially defending the law before a federal judge hearing the Windsor lawsuit. Roberts tweaked Obama for not having ""the courage of conviction"" to continue enforcing the law even if he thought it was discriminatory. At a news conference later Wednesday, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California called congressional Republicans irresponsible for funding the defense of what she called a discriminatory law at a cost she put at $3 million. ""On the basis of what I heard, the questions of the justices, the response of the participants, I'm very optimistic that DOMA will be struck down,"" Pelosi said. Hear, read the arguments for yourself . ""We didn't have horns"" To Windsor, Wednesday's arguments represented another step in the evolving history of gay rights in America. For years, she said, she wore a circle of diamonds as a pin instead of a traditional diamond ring to hide her lesbian relationship from co-workers. Victory for lesbian, years after her longtime partner's death . ""We all lived, really, behind masks and in closets, indeed,"" Windsor explained. ""So what happened is there was, as we increasingly came out, people saw that we didn't have horns. People learned that, okay, we were their kids and their cousins and their friends, all of whom were coming out for the first time. And I think it just, it just grew to where we were human beings like everybody else. And I really think that's what made the change."" Laughing, she told reporters: ""I'm talking to you freely. I'd have been hiding in a closet 10 years ago."" Public interest remained high outside the court in advance of Wednesday's session, but not at the same level as Tuesday's arguments in another case involving California's voter-approved ban of same-sex marriage. A smaller crowd gathered than the day before, with most of them opponents of DOMA. ""I'm here today because I'm a social worker and I've seen a lot of people suffer over the years,"" Mary Ann Piet told CNN. ""And I'm concerned about not getting people their human rights, their dignity as people."" Conservative supporters of the law contend it codifies a fundamental cornerstone of society, and changing the definition of marriage would have widespread negative impacts. 5 things we learned from oral arguments . The California case . During Tuesday's arguments, the justices seemed to lack consensus on both jurisdictional and constitutional questions relating to the voter-approved California law, known as Proposition 8, which bans same-sex marriage. The overriding legal question in the California case is whether the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under the law prevents states from refusing marriage to a defined class of people. When it rules, the court could strike down laws across the country banning same-sex marriage, or it could leave the current patchwork of state laws in place, choosing to let state legislatures and state courts sort it all out. ""This was a deeply divided Supreme Court, and a court that seemed almost to be groping for an answer here,"" CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin said after the arguments. Key questions answered . Four of the more liberal justices seemed at least open to the idea that same-sex marriage should be allowed in California. Three of the more conservative justices seemed aligned with the view that marriage should only be for a man and a woman, and it's likely they'd be joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, who doesn't speak at arguments. That could leave Kennedy as the swing vote, as has often been the case. While admitting the law's defenders are ""not just any citizens,"" Kennedy raised concerns about whether just the possibility of same-sex marriage was enough to establish they had suffered harm -- a key jurisdictional hurdle allowing them to appeal in the first place. Weigh your state with CNN's LGBT rights calculator . Nine states permit same-sex marriage . Among the 41 states that now forbid same-sex marriage, nine of them allow civil partnerships. Nine other states allow same-sex marriage, and about 120,000 same-sex couples have gotten married, according to estimates. Prohibitions seem to run counter to polls that show rising support overall for same-sex marriage. A CNN/ORC International poll released on Monday found 53% of Americans now support same-sex marriage, up from 40% in 2007. As to how the federal government should handle the issue, another CNN/ORC International poll out Tuesday found 56% of the public feels the federal government should also legally recognize same-sex marriages.

"(CNN) -- Will New Yorkers elect a punchline as mayor? Anthony Weiner's entry into the New York City race for mayor was one of the issues we discussed with comedian Jim Gaffigan, our guest this week on the CNN weekly podcast ""The Big Three,"" co-hosted by CNN's Margaret Hoover, John Avlon and myself. Jim, who many know from his Comedy Central specials and his numerous appearances on ""The Late Show With David Letterman"" and ""Conan,"" also talked with us about his new book ""Dad Is Fat"" (No. 5 on The New York Times' Best Sellers List), in which he writes about the adventures of raising five young children with his wife in a midsized New York City apartment. Jim offered some very funny yet helpful advice to my co-hosts, who are married to each other and expecting their first child this summer. Jim offered particularly instructive guidance for how Margaret and John can cope with their expected son's most traumatizing day: His circumcision. But back to Anthony Weiner: For those of you who missed it, in 2011 the former congressman texted pictures of his private parts to women, lied about it, had to resign. We all agreed his mayoral bid can't simply be dismissed as a joke. In fact, a new poll has him in second place in the mayoral race, and he has close to $4 million in his campaign chest. Weiner might just win this race --assuming he has figured out the proper way to use Twitter. In the podcast, we also tackled two other issues that sparked heated discussions and had unexpected results. The first was political hypocrisy in the response to the Oklahoma tornado. Certainly all elected officials expressed their condolences and support for the people who suffered as a result of this devastating natural disaster. But we saw some Republican members of Congress from Oklahoma -- most notably Sen. James Inhofe -- now supporting federal disaster relief for the people of their state. But these same people opposed supporting federal aid for the victims of Superstorm Sandy, which hit in October. This wasn't lost on a fellow Republican, Rep. Peter King of New York. He called them out -- and caused me, probably for the first time in my life, to agree with something King said. Our biggest debate on this issue, though, was over the role the federal government should play in helping people after a natural disaster. Margaret said federal government shouldn't be the primary source of funding for these people, arguing that instead the government can be a facilitator, seeking and encouraging private funds and donations to provide assistance. In contrast, I strongly believe that the federal government should be leading and funding the relief effort so that people in need are helped as quickly as possible. Our third big issue was New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's comment this week that if you weren't at the top of your class in high school, you shouldn't waste the money and time on college and instead you should become ""a plumber."" As John noted, this sentiment echoed a 2012 statement by former Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum, who mocked President Barack Obama as being a ""snob"" for saying he wanted everyone to go to college. Instead, Santorum believed that some should forget college and instead pursue jobs that require using your hands. While we all agreed that the costs of a college education now border on the obscene, we did not agree on what was causing the hike in tuition prices. But there was no dispute that anyone who dreams of going to college and has graduated high school should have the opportunity to pursue higher education. A college education not only increases a person's knowledge, it results in more employment opportunities and better wages. In fact, people with less than a high school diploma have an unemployment rate of 12.4%. In contrast, the unemployment rate of those with a four-year college degree is only 4.5%, well below the national unemployment rate of 7.5%.

"(CNN) -- Tears flowed and hugs were traded on Thursday in an Oklahoma maternity ward as four nurses saw for the first time the baby whose birth they helped safeguard during a direct hit by Monday's tornado. ""Look how handsome your boy is,"" said one of them, when she saw the 4-day-old boy. But baby Braeden's birth came only after a very close brush with the twister. His mother, Shayla Taylor, was already in labor when the tornado turned toward Moore, Oklahoma. She was so far along -- dilated and going through contractions -- that in spite of the approaching storm, there was no way to evacuate her. ""She couldn't move,"" said Alyson Heeke, nurse supervisor at Moore Medical Center. ""She'd had an epidural anesthesia, which meant that it numbed her enough that she couldn't walk."" As the tornado came closer, the medical staff moved Taylor into a hallway, then to a windowless operating room that offered more protection. ""Her baby was not doing the best,"" said charge nurse Cindy Popejoy, ""so I really needed a way to monitor her baby to see how the baby was tolerating the labor process -- especially since she was so far dilated. So the only place to do that would be the OR."" With the twister bearing down on them, the four nurses -- Popejoy, Heeke, Barbara Brand and Bonny Stephens -- covered their patient with blankets, pillows and even their own bodies. ""We actually were on the floor,"" said Heeke. ""Bonny the scrub-tech was kind of leaned over her a little more. We had blankets and pillows all around her. We were holding onto each other -- and the bed."" Within minutes, the hospital was hit with massive force. Taylor said she did not know whether she and the baby would survive, but she kept praying. ""I knew we were getting hit directly,"" she said. ""I felt the floor start shaking. It feels like an earthquake."" The outside wall of the operating room was ripped off, but everyone in the room survived. Afterward, debris was lying everywhere, including heavy equipment and lighting fixtures strewn across the floor. There was wreckage in every direction, there was a gaping hole where the wall once stood, and the baby-warmer was silhouetted against the open sky. ""I opened my eyes, I could see I-35,"" said Taylor. ""And I could see the movie theater."" But Shayla's husband Jerome -- who had taken cover downstairs with their 4- year-old son Shaeden -- did not know whether she had survived and did not know how to find her. ""They were saying 'No, everyone's out of the building,' "" he said. ""And I was like 'No, my wife - my wife is upstairs."" He soon found her, and she was transported on a flat board down a stairwell and through the debris. Shayla Taylor was closer than ever to giving birth. She was taken to the nearby hospital in Norman and gave birth within hours. Braeden weighed in at 8 pounds, 3 ounces. ""He probably will sleep through anything now,"" Heeke said with a smile. Shayla Taylor is herself studying to become a nurse. Seeing these nurses put a patient's welfare ahead of their own, she said, has made her more committed than ever to becoming a caregiver. ""Those nurses are amazing,"" she said. Students, teachers from tornado-leveled school say goodbye . A mother's instincts saves her three sons -- here's how .

"(CNN) -- Angelina Jolie, when writing about her preventive double mastectomy, did not discuss how much her surgeries cost, but she did mention that many women would not be able to afford the $3,000 to $4,000 test that led her to make the decision. What she failed to say was why the test costs so much. Jolie had the surgery, and says she intends to have preventive oophorectomy, which is the surgical removal of ovaries, because she inherited a mutation on one of the so-called breast cancer genes, BRCA1. That mutation, according to the Stanford Cancer Center, increases a woman's risk of breast cancer to 65% and ovarian cancer to 39% by the age of 70. The reason the test is so expensive is this: In 1998 Myriad Genetics patented two genes: BRCA1 and BRCA2. With its exclusive rights, Myriad developed a test for mutations on those genes trademarked ""BRACAnalysis."" Because it essentially owns the genes, Myriad is the only company that can conduct the test, so it sets the price. Next month, the U.S. Supreme Court, in the case of the Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, is expected to rule on whether it is indeed legal for Myriad Genetics to hold patents on the BRCA genes. The case was filed in 2009 by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Public Patent Foundation on behalf of genetic researchers, counselors, medical organizations and patients, who argue the genes cannot be patented because they are products of nature. Much of what we know about genes traces to the Human Genome Project. As a public works venture, it had a fundamental aim to make its data freely available. Those 3 billion subunits of genetic code were to be used for the public good in the development of approaches to treat, detect and prevent disease. In this spirit, the American College of Medical Genetics explains that gene patents, to the contrary, limit innovation and accessibility, hinder quality, slow improvement and restrict the workforce. Studies find that researchers avoid, delay or stop work because of patent-related concerns, such as difficulty getting approvals from patent owners, worry that their licenses could be revoked or fear that patent holders could, in effect, claim what they develop as their own. James Watson, a Nobel Prize winner and co-discoverer of the DNA double helix, stresses that human genes should not be controlled by legal monopolies. He filed a brief in the case against gene patenting, calling it ""lunacy."" Yet some 40% of the human genetic code is already patented. Justices at odds over patents for human genes . Myriad's test is targeted at people at high risk. But most cases of breast or ovarian cancer are not related to BRCA mutations and less than 1% of American women are likely to have them. The company boasts a preeminent market position focused on three initiatives: to grow existing tests and markets, to expand internationally and to launch new products, including companion diagnostics. With BRCAnalysis as the major revenue producer -- 75% of the portfolio -- one of the ways to make good on this promise is to convince consumers they need the test and get doctors to write the scripts. Myriad went to the direct-to-consumer market in 2002 with television, radio and print and launched a larger campaign in 2007. Women's voices created the campaign message: ""Breast cancer runs in my family. My mother, my grandmother, my dad's sisters. I wondered if it would be inevitable. I found out it didn't have to be. I found out my risk through BRACAnalysis ... a blood test that has helped thousands of women find out their risk for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. After BRACAnalysis, I realized I can choose to do something now, to help reduce my cancer risk now, with effective medical options."" Rather than reaching high-risk families, researchers, writing in the American College of Genetics journal, warned the ads would create ""spurious demand for the tests"" and waste the time of health professionals who would have to filter the demand and explain genetics to those who were not high risk. Professionals without formal training in genetic testing, however, might themselves overly rely on Myriad's educational, more accurately called promotional, materials. It would be hard for me to imagine that doctors could be susceptible had it not been for a friend who called me in a panic after her gynecologist recommended the test. It was a routine visit. She had no symptoms. After giving her family history, which would not meet high-risk criteria, the doctor said she needed BRCAnalysis. When my friend asked why she needed it and what she would learn from it, the doctor said, ""Well, if it's positive we'll check for cancer...If you have cancer, we'll consider chemotherapy and radiation... If it's positive and you don't have cancer, you can have a double mastectomy with reconstruction and an oophorectomy with hormone replacement.... If it's negative, then you know."" My friend was stunned. Worried. Skeptical. She had questions. How much would it cost? About $1,000 out-of-pocket ... with insurance? She guessed she could use her savings. ""I'm only 43,"" she said. ""You want to cut off my breasts and take my ovaries? I don't want to have children...I don't think... but I'm not ready for menopause. You think I could have cancer? Why?"" After a few moments of tense conversation, the doctor ordered the test and my friend left. She sat in her car and cried. After doing research, she concluded that she was not a good candidate. She canceled it and found a new doctor. Finances and genetic counseling influence the frequency of genetic testing, whether people are high risk or not. They also affect decisions about interventions. The treatment Angelina Jolie had is expensive and complicated. Up to 35% of women who get post-mastectomy reconstructions get infections. Implants need to be replaced and rupture frequently enough that we have ruptured implant specialists. To find better options means independent research needs to be encouraged. When big biotech companies own genes, that stifles or even prevents innovation. When companies aggressively promote expensive and often unnecessary medical tests, it isn't always in the service of patients and good health. The Supreme Court decision could set free the dream of personalized medicine or shut it down. In the meantime, after Angelina Jolie's announcement, Myriad Genetics' stock rose to a three-year high. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gayle Sulik.","Gayle Sulik: The test to find if you have BRCA1 gene mutation that raises cancer risk is costly .
Sulik says that's because Myriad Genetics owns the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes .
She says Myriad has monopoly and aggressively markets often unnecessary test .

"(CNN) -- Renisha McBride's toxicology report is out and now we know the 19-year-old had a blood-alcohol level that was more than twice the legal limit for driving. This would explain why, according to her family, she was involved in a single-car accident. However, it does not explain why Theodore Wafer shot her in the face. McBride's family says she was seeking help after the crash and knocked on the door of Wafer's house in Dearborn, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. The 54-year-old Wafer, who is white, told investigators he feared McBride, who is black, was trying to break in. There are too many unanswered questions to know exactly what happened that night. But we do know this: If a black man told police officers ""self-defense"" was the reason why he shot an unarmed white teenage girl in the face with his shotgun, it would not have taken protests, national media attention and nearly two weeks for authorities to reject that excuse. And this is why McBride's death -- ruled a homicide after protests and national media attention -- draws comparisons to that of Trayvon Martin, the Florida teen shot and killed by George Zimmerman, who is of white and Latino heritage, last year. Not that the events leading up to their shootings are identical. They are not. But statistics show the benefit of doubt granted to those who have spilled black blood is not extended as graciously when roles are reversed. In other words, if someone told you a black man stalked, confronted and eventually murdered an unarmed white teenage boy, it's doubtful ""self-defense"" would get him off the hook. And it shouldn't, because that sounds ridiculous. But when the victim is black, the narrative that has historically characterized blacks as a menace -- the narrative that gets supported by out-of-context crime statistics, pop culture imagery and media coverage -- assigns culpability and thus plausibility. On Friday, Wafer was finally charged with second-degree murder, manslaughter and possession of a firearm in the commission of a felony. We're finally on the road to finding out the truth, and perhaps even achieving justice for McBride. But will another high-profile, racially charged murder trial get us any closer to debunking the strain of thinking that places ""fear for one's life"" and an unarmed, dead black person in the same scenario far too often? This is the same idea that says it's completely reasonable for the NYPD to continue to ""stop and frisk"" â€” a practice that disproportionately targets black people, despite its resulting in confiscation of a gun one-tenth of one percent of the time. It's the idea that says two police officers, who fired 15 shots at an unarmed, 60-year-old black man in his own driveway, are the victims. It's the idea that says there's no need to quickly make an arrest -- even though McBride's unarmed body is lying in a pool of blood and the nearby weapon is still warm -- because the killer may have ""acted as a reasonable person would who was in fear for his life,"" as Cheryl Carpenter, the lawyer of the alleged shooter, claims. Between 2005 and 2010, an Urban Institute study, using FBI data, found that white-on-black shootings were found to be justified 11.5% of the time in states that don't have stand-your-ground laws and 17% of the time in those that do -- the highest among all combinations. Black-on-white homicides were ruled to be justified 1% of the time in stand-your-ground states and even less frequently in states without the law. Now, obviously statistics don't reveal the circumstances surrounding each shooting, but they do reinforce the narrative that black people are inherently more dangerous. Thus Pasadena police were found ""justified"" in killing a black, unarmed 19-year-old college student who was falsely accused of robbery. Los Angeles police who shot and killed an unarmed black, autistic 27-year-old did so ""in defense of their lives"" according to their attorneys. It's the same fear that led four police officers to fire 41 shots at an unarmed black man on the stoop of his New York apartment in 1999, hitting him 19 times. It's the same fear that led an officer to shoot and kill an unarmed 24-year-old black man who, like McBride, was reportedly in a single car accident and went out looking for help earlier this year. You can tell yourself all these stories are just tragic one-offs if it makes you feel better. Parents of black children don't have the luxury. Sure, there are plenty of examples of blacks committing crimes but how does that justify pre-emptive strikes? How does that make substituting ""open season"" with ""self-defense"", OK? I remember something former NFL player Dhani Jones once told me: ""A lot of upper-middle-class black people hear reports about a black athlete and assume he's guilty. ... If he's innocent, they'll see it more as a special case than the norm."" This attitude extends to society as a whole. Assuming black people are inherently up to no good is not just something some white people are guilty of. There are blacks who are leery of blacks as well. That is the power of the narrative. That is the subtlety of institutionalized racism. It doesn't wear a hood or burn crosses in a yard. Rather it's the subconscious element of our culture that looks at a black corpse and quietly puts it, instead of the perpetrator, on trial. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","Renisha McBride, black teen, was shot dead after knocking on a white homeowner's door .

"(CNN) -- New York's infamous ""Hot Dog Hooker"" allegedly tried to serve up the full works to one customer, but she didn't know the customer was an undercover detective and is now facing a prostitution case, police said. Catherina G. Scalia, 47, of East Rockaway, New York, was arrested after she responded to a call to go a hotel on Long Island, police said. She even drove her hot dog vending truck there, authorities said. Scalia gave the undercover cop a massage -- without a license -- late Friday afternoon, police allege. She's also accused of unauthorized practice, police said. Then came her alleged offer for additional services, police said. ""She also offered to engage in a sexual act for an undetermined amount of money. Scalia was placed under arrest without incident,"" a Nassau County Police Department statement said. Scalia disputed the charges at her arraignment Saturday in a Nassau County Court in Hempstead, CNN affiliate WCBS reported. ""They keep framing me. I am broke. I am jobless. All these arrests are entrapment,"" Scalia said. When CNN's Jeanne Moos profiled Scalia and her hot dog truck a year ago, Scalia asserted she was a stripper, not a prostitute. At the time, Scalia said she pleaded guilty in a recent criminal case: ""I pleaded guilty to stripper. A stripper is not a prostitute,"" she told CNN. In fact, in last year's incident, Scalia actually pleaded guilty to misdemeanor prostitution after an undercover officer bought hot dogs from her stand, took her business card offering topless dances, and received a lap dance at her home. About nine years ago, Scalia faced a similar charge of prostitution out of her hot dog truck. Scalia has four teenage boys, but she said last year they were in their grandmother's custody. ""To my boys I say your mother's a stripper. You're gonna have to live with that 'till the day you die,"" Scalia said. Scalia's hot dog business uses the slogan: ""Get a little wiggle with your wiener.""

"Santa Ana, California (CNN) -- A California judge ordered Wednesday that two Fullerton police officers stand trial in the beating death last year of Kelly Thomas, a homeless man with a mental illness. Officer Manuel Ramos is charged with second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter, and Cpl. Jay Patrick Cicinelli is charged with involuntary manslaughter and felony use of excessive force. Orange County Superior Court Judge Walter Schwarm scheduled the next hearing in the case on May 22. Schwarm's ruling came after a three-day preliminary hearing that ended Wednesday. Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas, who's prosecuting the case, told reporters that he expected defense attorneys to challenge Wednesday's ruling in a motion and possibly an appeal. Rackauckas said the case ""was a terrible incident, and we're going to proceed forward and get justice."" ""This is a hard thing to file, a case of this nature against police officers, because we have tremendous law enforcement in Orange County,"" Rackauckas told reporters. ""This kind of incident is very damaging to the community -- to everybody, the police, the community -- because it erodes that trust. ""It brings down the image of the entire community,"" the county's elected prosecutor said. Ron Thomas, the father of Kelly Thomas, told reporters after the ruling that the Fullerton Police Department ""is full of good officers."" Opinion: Words to break a father's heart . ""It's just this band of criminals, these hoodlums,"" Ron Thomas added. Ron Thomas noted he and others in his family have worked in law enforcement for ""generations."" He said his son would have ""never thought a police officer would beat him to death."" The three-day hearing included attorneys repeating a profanity that Ramos uttered to Kelly Thomas, who had schizophrenia, before a total of six police officers were involved in subduing and beating him. Rackauckas said he repeated the obscenity several times in court to show how Ramos' conduct was ""a very far departure from professional and reasonable police"" practices. Kelly Thomas was shirtless and with a backpack when Ramos first approached him in response to a police call that a transient male fitting that description at the Fullerton bus depot was ""trying door handles,"" attorneys for both sides said. The incident evolved into a police inquiry into ""a minor property crime"" possibly involving receiving stolen property, Rackauckas told the court. During testimony earlier Wednesday, Orange County coroner's pathologist Dr. Aruna Singhania continuing answering questions for a second day from attorneys for Ramos and Cicinelli about the autopsy she performed on Thomas, 37, after the July incident. Ramos and Cicinelli have pleaded not guilty to the charges. Later, in presenting arguments before the court ruling was issued, Rackauckas told the judge that there's sufficient evidence to put the two officers on trial. ""It's a very bad day in Orange County when we have to charge two police officers with these kinds of terrible crimes,"" the county's elected prosecutor told the judge. ""They're sworn to uphold the law, and they're entrusted with the authority given to them by the state of California."" Defense attorneys objected when Rackauckas continued his comments and started speaking of the ""awesome power"" with which police officers are entrusted. ""This is not a press conference,"" said attorney Michael Schwartz, representing defendant Cicinelli. The prosecutor discontinued that line of argument and began addressing other topics after the judge told him: ""The court does understand the powers that police officers have, and the level of trust that society places in police officers."" John Barnett, the attorney for Ramos, argued that prosecutors didn't provide sufficient evidence to order his client to stand trial. On Tuesday, Singhania provided the court with nearly two dozen autopsy photos, prompting Thomas' mother and father to leave the courtroom, as they did on Monday when a videotape of the beating was played. The 16 minutes of video came from a surveillance camera at a downtown Fullerton bus depot where the incident occurred. Singhania testified Tuesday that based on her autopsy, medical records and the videotape, she determined mechanical chest compressions with blunt cranial injuries caused Thomas' death. Singhania also testified that Thomas suffered a complete hemorrhaging of his left eye. Thomas was beaten by police during the July 5, 2011, incident and died five days later, prosecutors say. The FBI is investigating civil rights violations in the case, as well. Rackauckas has said that Thomas suffered brain injuries, facial fractures, rib fractures and extensive bruising and abrasions. The county coroner listed his manner of death as a homicide and said he died because he was unable to breathe after having his chest compressed. Ramos, 37, a 10-year veteran of the police department, would face a maximum sentence of 15 years to life if convicted, authorities said. Cicinelli, 39, a 12-year Fullerton police veteran, would face a maximum of four years in prison if convicted.

"(CNN) -- If only what happened in Vegas had stayed in Vegas. Everything that made ""The Hangover"" such an unexpected hit -- its bold, brilliant pick-up-the-pieces story structure; the way it reveled in exposing the wild side of its outwardly conventional (if mismatched) buddies; and the big dose of strange that was Zack Galifianakis in his breakthrough movie role -- has been squandered and cheapened in two uninspired, largely mirthless and meretricious sequels. So much for hair of the dog. At least this time Todd Phillips and co-writer Craig Mazin have come up with some new beats in ""The Hangover Part III,"" instead of presenting a carbon copy of the first film. (Original writers Jon Lucas and Scott Moore are long gone, of course.) If you're looking for plot, they've got one. It's lazy, but at least it's straightforward. Phil, Stu and Doug (Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Justin Bartha) are escorting their emotionally volatile buddy Alan (Zack Galifianakis) to a rehab clinic when they're forced off the road. Crime boss Marshall (John Goodman) explains -- at length -- how their old sparring partner Chow (Ken Jeong) has escaped from a Bangkok prison. Marshall means to hold Doug captive until the Wolfpack produces Chow and the gold bullion he stole. The hunt for Chow takes them to Mexico, for no very good reason, then back to Nevada, for closure (we hope). If Goodman seems subdued after his big, boisterous turns in ""Argo"" and ""Flight,"" it could be because the writing is so hack -- or maybe he figured there was just no way anyone was going further over the top than Ken Jeong, whose angry cokehead /rabid degenerate shtick is way beyond funny. His seething hatred for man and beast (""Make sure you kill the guard dogs,"" he insists at one point) is so venomous it smacks of some kind of warped integrity. Not that Phillips and company are aiming for warm and fuzzy here. The movie begins (you probably saw a PG version in the trailer) with a giraffe coming to a sticky end on a highway overpass. After buttering us up with this grotesque roadkill, the writers follow through with a scene of Alan blithely badgering his father into a fatal heart attack. It's daring, I suppose, almost a form of anti-comedy. It's so divorced from anything you would want to laugh at. Except that almost none of the audience I saw it with was laughing. Too often, in ""Hangover III,"" profanity passes for wit and bad taste is equated with taboo-busting. If there is something subversive about Alan's man-love for Phil -- and Galifianakis' presexual overgrown adolescent remains the movie's closeted comedic focal point -- it's all bound up in an ugly tangle of homophobic taunts, male bonding cliches, and the virtual exclusion of the opposite sex (Heather Graham's solitary scene very much included). For a series built on friendship, this is one cold and alienating movie, a comedy for sociopaths. The longer we hang out with these guys, the less fun they are to be with. And judging by the way he seems to be edging out of the frame all the time, I'm guessing Bradley Cooper feels the same way. It may represent a marginal improvement on the disastrous second film, but there must be a hole in the desert somewhere big enough to bury this sorry, sordid franchise once and for all.","The gang is all back for this ""Hangover"" sequel .

"(CNN) -- When an EF5 tornado touched down in Moore, Oklahoma, this week, Tad Agoglia and his First Response Team of America were stationed at a hotel about 30 miles away, ready to take action. About two hours after the storm hit, they were already on the scene using their specialized equipment to dig through the rubble at Plaza Towers Elementary School. ""We were digging up an area of the school we thought there could be some young children trapped,"" said Agoglia, a 2008 CNN Hero. ""Seeing the desks, pieces of paper children had written on, it just stopped me in my tracks, and it reminded me of why I do what I do every day."" In the last six years, Agoglia's group has responded to more than 50 large-scale disasters, including the 2010 earthquake in Haiti and Hurricane Sandy in New York. The group owns cranes to lift heavy debris, and it has plasma cutters that can slice through steel beams and concrete. Agoglia said that when he and his team arrived in Moore, they knew immediately that there would be an enormous need. They plan to stay and help as many people as they can over the next several weeks before hurricane season gets into full swing. Another group founded by a CNN Hero, the National Disaster Search Dog Foundation, has also been helping in the recovery efforts. It mobilized 10 teams of dogs and their handlers to search for survivors buried in the rubble. ""This tornado showed us nature's rage at its worst,"" said Wilma Melville, a 2011 CNN Hero. She said her team ""specifically placed four teams in Oklahoma City and four in Tulsa, Oklahoma, so that they would be near areas of anticipated tornado activity. Speedy search capability is a wonderful asset."" The teams searched schools, homes and a bowling alley leveled by the storm, which led one handler to text when he arrived on scene: ""Devastation. Near tears."" Also helping out is Team Rubicon, a group of military veterans who work together to help communities hit by natural disasters. Founded by 2012 CNN Hero Jake Wood, it has 30 members on the ground now and is mobilizing hundreds more from across the country. ""This is every bit as bad as Joplin,"" said Wood, referring to the Missouri tornado from May 2011. ""Many of our volunteers were at Joplin almost exactly two years ago, and many of us thought we'd never see that level of destruction again."" Larger crews will arrive in Moore on Saturday to help with recovery efforts, including cleaning up debris and fixing homes. Wood anticipates having about 250 veterans helping over the next several weeks. Want to get involved?

"WICHITA, Kansas (CNN) -- On a beautiful, crisp late fall afternoon, rock icon Neil Young took his 1959 Lincoln Continental for one last spin before a team of mechanics ripped out its gas-guzzling engine to make way for an electric motor. Neil Young watches as mechanics remove the engine from his 1959 Lincoln Continental. Car buffs may think it's sacrilege to tear apart an automotive classic, but Young wants it to have a new life as a fuel-efficient hybrid. ""If we're going to make a difference, truly make cars more environmentally friendly,"" Young said, ""we have to make that emotional connection."" Young said everyone has a connection with an old car like the Lincoln. It only took about an hour for Johnathan Goodwin and his four-man team to pry the engine out of Young's Lincoln. He'll have the new engine installed in 45 days.  Watch Goodwin show off a biodesel hotrod » . Talking about the old motor, Goodwin says, ""Of course, it's not fuel efficient at all. It's a big polluter, one of the biggest rawest forms."" The Lincoln's new electric engine will power the car and when it begins to lose juice, Young will simply flip a switch and the car will run on biodiesel fuel until the electric motor is recharged. ""A 19-foot-long car, the longest car ever made at its time. Two and half tons, the heaviest car at its time,"" Young said, ""And it can get 100 miles to the gallon, not 10 miles to the gallon."" Young renamed his car Linc-Volt, and is making a movie about the transformation, which he hopes to release next year. Goodwin is making a name for himself -- and his company, H-Line Conversions -- by turning gas-guzzling behemoths like Hummers, Cadillac Escalades, Jeeps and other big American cars into clean-power machines. The first thing he does is remove the old inefficient engine -- even if it's a brand new vehicle -- and replace it with a diesel engine that can run on biodiesel. ""It's the transformation of what I call old technology to new technology,"" Goodwin says. Here's his analogy: Remember 15 or so years ago when a cellular phone was the size of a brick. Now it's a lot smaller, because the industry underwent a ton of changes over the years. The same kinds of advances are made in engines. But since it's so expensive, changes to cars are made in leaps, not tiny steps. What's the drawback of his method? You guessed it. Cost. ""It's not cost-effective for someone to run out and spend $40,000 to double the fuel economy, but I have no shortage of customers,"" Goodwin says. Including California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who's having his Wagoneer converted to biodiesel. Goodwin, 37, drives a 1987 gas burning Wagoneer, rents his home and will sheepishly tell you he didn't graduate from high school. Expect to hear a lot more about Goodwin in the future. Companies are knocking down the door to work on projects with him. Goodwin's developing a download that can be installed in a car's computer and improve the mileage by five to seven mpg without losing performance. He expects it to cost about $200. Ask Goodwin what his favorite project is, and he answers, ""the next one"" but the Linc-Volt project has been special. ""We're going to prove you can have your cake and eat it too so to speak,"" Goodwin proudly boasts. E-mail to a friend .","Small Kansas company turning gas-guzzlers into biodiesel hybrids .

"(CNN) -- Robbie Rogers became the first openly gay male athlete to play in a pro American sporting match Sunday when he took the field for Major League Soccer's Los Angeles Galaxy during a rout of the Seattle Sounders. Not to be overlooked in the landmark moment is Rogers' prescience. In remarks to ESPN before the game, he said, ""I'm hoping I can come on and it's 4-0 and I can just enjoy myself."" Which is exactly what happened. With 13 minutes remaining in the game, Rogers came in as a substitute for midfielder Juninho with the Galaxy up by four goals. Emphatic applause erupted from the stands at the Home Depot Center. Before the game, Los Angeles native Jason Collins, a pro basketball player who announced last month that he was gay, tweeted Rogers to say good luck. Rogers said after the game that the experience was ""perfect, really perfect."" ""The first training session the Galaxy ever had on the Home Depot Center pitch, I was here training,"" he said. ""I've kind of been on this huge journey to kind of figure out my life, and now I'm back here, I think kind of where I'm supposed to be."" Bleacher Report: Twitter reacts . Rogers was introduced as the newest member of the Los Angeles Galaxy on Saturday, making him the first openly gay male athlete in Major League Soccer and ending his brief retirement. The Galaxy signed Rogers to a multiyear contract after acquiring him from the Chicago Fire, which held his rights, in exchange for midfielder Mike Magee. Rogers, a former winger for the U.S. national team, had retired from soccer in February at age 25, announcing then that he is gay. However, he still had the passion for the game. He trained with the Galaxy for about a month before making the comeback official. ""After I finally got in here, everything was completely normal, as it should be,"" Rogers said at his introductory news conference. ""Getting back on the pitch was amazing."" Opinion: Lust in the locker room -- get over it? But even though he still enjoys the game, deciding to come back was not easy for Rogers, who said he was afraid to share the secret about his sexual orientation for 25 years. ""I kept my secret because I thought I couldn't be both a soccer player and a gay athlete,"" Rogers said. ""I figured it out that it's not true, but I felt that way. So I was afraid to put myself back into a situation where I felt like I was kind of an outcast or just different than people."" In his career, Rogers also has played for MLS club Columbus Crew from 2007 to 2011, winning the MLS Cup in 2008. He also briefly played for English club Leeds United. Los Angeles head coach Bruce Arena believes that Rogers will make an impact on the field with his play. ""We've been searching for the last year or two for a player that has the skills to be a flank player, play wide and add a little speed to our club, take on players and a good crosser off the ball with both of his feet,"" Arena said. ""He offers qualities that we've been looking for, so we're hopeful that in time, Robbie will demonstrate the kind of qualities that he has previously in this league."" Rogers isn't the only trailblazer for male gay athletes in American professional sports. Twelve-year NBA veteran Collins announced he was gay, but he has not played a game since he made the announcement. He is currently a free agent.

"(CNN) -- It's hard to imagine a scene more gruesome and disturbing than the one Londoners encountered on an inner-city street Wednesday. A person hacked to death, lying in a pool of his own blood. His assailants standing nearby, covered in blood and brandishing gore-soaked knives and meat cleavers as they spew violent rhetoric. A car smashed into a lamppost a few yards away. Most bystanders kept their distance, understandably. Yet one woman directly confronted the apparent murderers -- in fact, she jumped off her bus and rushed to the scene when she saw what looked like a car accident, then stuck around and tried to engage both attackers in conversation even after she realized what was going on. The woman, a 48-year-old mother of two named Ingrid Loyau-Kennett, later said she was trying to talk them down and keep them from hurting anyone else, especially children. Why did she put herself on the line when so many others stayed away? We don't really know enough about Loyau-Kennett to be able to say for sure; perhaps we never will. History is filled with heroes, from Oskar Schindler to Paul Rusesabagina of Hotel Rwanda fame, whose life histories couldn't have predicted the extraordinary things that they later did. Cub scout leader, ex-teacher confronted London terrorist . But what we do know, thanks to social psychology, is that what separates people like Loyau-Kennett from the rest of us is often extremely subtle. In fact, research suggests that many of us, perhaps to our own surprise, have the potential to find our own inner hero. What often makes the difference between a bystander and an ""upstander"" are the particulars of a crisis situation and how those details interact with a person's background. For instance, decades of research on the ""bystander effect"" has shown that even good, moral people fail to take action when confronted with an emergency. One famous study found that the only factor that determined whether bystanders stopped to help someone in need was whether they were in a hurry. Other research shows people are less likely to help when they're part of a crowd: They assume either that someone else will take responsibility or that there must not really be a crisis at all if no one else has acted yet. Taking action would mean going against the norm, breaking from the herd; they don't want to rock the boat. The bigger the crowd, the more likely all crowd members will do nothing. Yet there are exceptions. Research suggests, for example, that when people can be made to feel a personal connection to a victim, they might intervene in a situation that they would otherwise ignore. One British study even found that people were more willing to help an injured stranger if that stranger were wearing the jersey of their favorite soccer team. There are other exceptions as well. Research by Princeton psychologist John Darley, who pioneered the study of the bystander effect, has found no clear personality profile distinguishes the upstanders from the bystanders. More important, according to Darley and others, is whether people can recognize a crisis and feel they have the skills to help. That finding resonated in London when Loyau-Kennett, trying to explain her actions, cited her role as a Cub Scout leader, mentioning that she had to learn first aid for the position. It was her knowledge of first aid that initially prompted her to get off her bus, thinking that she could help the victim she saw lying on the ground. Similarly, after Wesley Autrey-- aka the Subway Hero -- leaped onto New York City subway tracks to save someone who'd fallen in front of a train back in 2007, many observers later pointed to Autrey's Navy service to explain why this otherwise unexceptional man sprang to action while everyone else simply watched. In their own extensive analysis of what makes a hero, psychologists Zeno Franco and Philip Zimbardo suggest that people who don't succumb to the bystander effect are sometimes people who generally don't adhere to social norms and conventions. That means they're prone to intervene and take positive action when no one else will. But it may also mean they're prone to break other rules. Franco and Zimbardo cite the story of Jabar Gibson, who was hailed as a hero after he drove 70 people to safety from the flooding caused by Hurricane Katrina, commandeering an abandoned school bus. Gibson thought to do something bold that others wouldn't do; he also had an extensive criminal record, which has grown in the years since. Does this mean we can expect Ingrid Loyau-Kennett to break the law in the not-too-distant future? Hardly. But it does challenge the notion that there's a distinct category of exceptional people who are heroes, elevated above the rest of us. Franco and Zimbardo have argued that deifying heroes like this -- what they call ""the myth of the 'heroic elect'"" -- has the perverse effect of making us blind to our own heroic potential. If instead we believe we're capable of heroism ourselves, we'll be better prepared to realize that potential and snap into action if and when our time comes. So science still hasn't gotten to the bottom of stories like Ingrid Loyau-Kennett's. But perhaps its greatest insight so far is that her story could be ours. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jason Marsh.","Ingrid Loyau-Kennett talked to murder suspects right after London hacking to calm them .
Jason Marsh: People who step up like her often think they have skills to help, like she did .
Marsh: Such people, sometimes, are a bit nonconformist .
He says we all have the potential to shake the ""bystander effect"" and find our inner hero ."
"New Delhi (CNN) -- A lawyer who says he's representing three of the five men charged with raping and fatally beating a woman on a New Delhi bus said Tuesday that he has advised his clients to plead not guilty. ""So far they have agreed to my advice, but a clearer picture will emerge by tomorrow evening,"" the attorney, Manohar Lal Sharma, told CNN. ""I fear they might come under pressure to change their mind."" Sharma said one of those he is representing is Ram Singh, the main accused in the case. The other two are Mukesh Singh and Akshay Thakur, he said. The horrific attack on the 23-year-old woman in New Delhi on December 16 has prompted angry protests over the country's treatment of women and handling of sexual attacks. India's interior minister has said he was also working with security officials to strengthen laws regarding rape and assault following the attack, which also stirred outrage worldwide. Proceedings against the five adult suspects began Monday, when a New Delhi judge ordered the trial closed after tempers flared inside the packed courtroom. Some lawyers loudly criticized colleagues for offering to represent the suspects, with one young lawyer shouting at Sharma, ""You will not defend those barbarians."" The magistrate, Namrita Aggarwal, ordered that the hearing take place behind closed doors and barred news outlets from publishing proceedings related to the case without the court's permission, citing concerns about the suspects' safety. The five men in court this week are charged with murder, rape and kidnapping, and could be sentenced to death if convicted. A juvenile court will take up the matter of determining the age of a sixth suspect, who claims to be 17 and therefore not old enough to be tried as an adult, CNN affiliate IBN reported. The female victim of the attack, whose name has not been released, died in a Singapore hospital in late December. Her male companion survived with a broken leg.","A lawyer for three suspects says he has advised them to plead not guilty .

"(EW.com) -- This is how it generally works: Jay Pharoah or Jason Sudeikis screams ""Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!"" The house band kicks in, the immortal Don Pardo announces the cast. And then, the stage door opens, and a smiling celebrity walks out towards the camera. You try and gauge her body language because what you really want to know is: Is this going to be funny? It's late on Saturday night and you just need to know whether you're going to watch this from start to finish right now ... or whether you should go to bed and simply scan through ""Weekend Update"" tomorrow on the DVR. Like a football or basketball game, a host can't ""win"" ""SNL"" with a great opening monologue, but he or she sure can screw it up. So it's no surprise that the best hosts typically come out of the gate revving on all cylinders. Good jokes help, and so do pratfalls, but the best of the best remind us that this is live television. It can be messy, and it can even be a trainwreck. But whatever it is, it can't be boring. 'Saturday Night Live' best-host contest: Who deserves a second chance? For the second straight year, EW.com readers have voted to determine who was ""SNL's"" best host. Throughout the show's season, the most recent host was pitted against the four most popular previous hosts in a vote, and the one with the least number of voters was eliminated while the four survivors advanced to the next week. Like any democracy, it's a system that's not without its flaws. This year, we rigged modified the system with what I call the Barabbas Addendum, which restored a previously eliminated host to the final vote. The electorate rescued Seth MacFarlane to join our final five: Martin Short, Justin Timberlake, Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig and Ben Affleck. I've said before that there are very few happy accidents on ""Saturday Night Live."" Comedy is precise. Live comedy is a gauntlet that can expose and undermine the proudest of entertainers. Each of our finalists, however, delivered monologues that set the tone for excellent shows that showcased the best of their abilities. 'Saturday Night Live' finale recap: Ben Affleck shines, but Stefon and Fred Armisen steal the show . More importantly for the success of the show, all of them also had a blast. I mean, it's possible they were terrified underneath, but once the show began, all six of them were giggly and daring and totally committed. They're good at hosting because they embrace the experience, trusting the writers and trusting their own talent. Before we announce the winner of Mr. (or Mrs.) Saturday Night 2013, though, there are four other non-democratic awards to present. Most Underrated Host: Louis CK (November 3) It helps, of course, if you think CK is a comic genius, but even if you're not tuned in to his brand of comedy, his first time hosting had a refreshingly off-beat vibe. Some hosts come in to Studio 8H and adhere to the proven formula and trust the writers to protect them. You almost got the sense that CK came with his own ideas â€” and the writing staff gave the comic's comic a wide berth to make the show his own. It wasn't perfect, but it felt like a CK joint. The monologue was a seven-minute stand-up bit on helping an ancient, disoriented Old World lady get to her airplane on time, and the show wrapped up with the original ""Last Call"" sketch, co-starring Kate McKinnon. In between there was the brilliant ""Lincoln"" short and the glorious ""Game of Thrones""-inspired misfire. (The latter literally gets funnier every time you watch it ... because it has to.) CK lasted a few weeks in our voting contest before being eliminated by Jeremy Renner, but if he hosts again next year he's a total must-watch, especially with one show under his belt. Best First-time Host: Seth MacFarlane (September 15) In some ways, MacFarlane's first appearance on ""Saturday Night Live"" was an audition for the Oscars. Less than a month after hosting the season premiere, the Academy Awards announced that the creative force behind ""Family Guy"" and ""Ted"" would host Hollywood's biggest night. On ""SNL,"" he sang, he provided voices, he mimicked celebrities. He did everything every host tries to do â€” he just did all of them well. Actually, I suspect MacFarlane is one of those whose second and third shows will be even better than his promising debut, in which he leaned on the easy references his biggest fans would most appreciate. With those out of the way, he should be even freer and more unpredictable the next time he visits. Seth Meyers will return to 'SNL' this fall, leave for 'Late Night' in 2014 . Best Opening Monologue: Vince Vaughn (April 13) There was a long sad stretch this season where every action star and Oscar nominee seemed eager to prove his versatility by singing during his ""SNL"" monologue. I'll admit it is sorta funny when someone like quarterback Tom Brady tries something this outlandish, but if you're an entertainer to start with, you have to be a-maze-ing at singing or dancing to get me to give two hoots about your hidden talent. Vaughn went in a completely different direction, wheeling out the classic, rat-tat-tat ""Swingers""/""Old School"" Vince Vaughn who likes to perform without a net. Was his interaction with the audience scripted? Was it half-scripted? Was it totally ad-libbed? For a few seconds, I was sweating for him. But as time went on, he seemed perfectly in control. I dug it in a very serious way. If it was simply Vaughn being Vaughn, then kudos. But if it was the writers, then bully for them. Best Sketch Starring the Host: ""Homeland,"" with Anne Hathaway . If you weren't a viewer of Showtime's ""Homeland,"" which stars Claire Danes as an unstable CIA operative intimately involved with her most dangerous suspect, this sketch was likely four minutes of scrunched noses and raised eyebrows. But if you were obsessed with the show, like the nearly 6 million people who watched the season two finale, Hathaway's impression of jazz-freakout Carrie was one of the most perceptive caricatures ""SNL"" has ever showcased. Hathaway even took time during her farewell later that night to apologize to Danes for poking fun, but she had absolutely nothing to be sorry about. Can we hope ""Homeland"" is in the middle of a season again the next time Hathaway gets the call? The 2013 Mrs. (or Mr.) Saturday Night is... ...Justin Timberlake. Timberlake's episode, which featured him being inducted into the exclusive Five-Timers Club, had the look and feel of a coronation. The show occurred at the center of a Timberlake promotional blitz that was anything but subtle â€” he even spent an entire week on ""Late Night"" with his ""History of Rap"" partner Jimmy Fallon. On his much-hyped return to ""SNL,"" he dominated the cold-open as Elton John, reunited with Andy Samberg to meet two wild and crazy Czechoslovakian brothers, and brought his foam mascot get-up to Veganville. Even Internet cynics struggled to complain. Melissa McCarthy was the runner-up for the second consecutive year. (You know the saying, always a ""Bridesmaid ..."") But she's certainly now on the short list of essential hosts, along with Timberlake, Fallon, Wiig, Zach Galifianakis and Jon Hamm (who by the way, despite popping up for frequent cameos lately, hasn't hosted since 2010). Of course, the person I'm already looking forward to hosting next season was a cast member just five days ago. Bill Hader will be missed, and I suspect he'll want to take some time before he returns to the show as a host. Nevertheless, it's tempting to circle September 27 on the calendar, the day that ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2"" arrives in theaters.

"Moore, Oklahoma (CNN) -- Five days ago, Miranda Mann huddled in a science classroom at Southmoore High School. She should have been filed with pride, relief and excitement about her upcoming graduation. Instead, she was filled with fear as a devastating tornado powered through her central Oklahoma city. The 18-year-old has been literally picking up the pieces of her life since. Her house was unrecognizable, except for her and her mother's cars, after the twister destroyed it Monday. Her family sifted through rubble and salvaged some things, only to see many of them -- such as her prized book collection -- ruined by torrential rains. Mann doesn't want to live in Moore, wary of a place that's been hit by two EF5 tornadoes -- the strongest possible -- over the past 14 years. There's been plenty of time, and way too many reasons, for tears. But finally ... finally, Saturday was a time to smile. ""My family is all here, we get to be together,"" Mann said about her graduation at Oklahoma City's Cox Convention Center. ""(You can) relax and let your hair down, because you know that we're not going back to the house today. We're not going to see that."" Southmoore High's seniors were one of three classes celebrating their commencement ceremonies at the facility. The date had been set for months, and it wasn't moved after the storm killed 24 people, injured more than 375 others and damaged 12,000 residences in and around the metropolitan area. A tornado bearing down; a mom in labor . Jake Spradling is glad the show went on. Like Mann, he's a Southmoore High senior; like her, he no longer has a place to call home. The hours since Monday have been ""overwhelming,"" Spradling admitted, though he said the outpouring of support -- offers to bunk early at Northwestern Oklahoma State University where he'll head this fall, dozens of text messages and ""calls out of the wazoo"" with offers of help -- have made a big difference. He knows people who lost family members, and many more who lost homes. He knows that they need time to plan and attend funerals, to clean up debris, to figure out what happens next. Even with all that, ""I'm glad it's today,"" Spradling said. ""It means to me that we're not going on different routes. ""We're staying on the same path that we were meant to be on."" One block, two tornadoes: Life in the crosshairs . Graduation festivities were infused by the tragedy, including speakers' remarks and other poignant reminders. One happened when Southmoore's Alyson Costilla walked across the stage to get her diploma and about a dozen people in the crowd stood up and held up pictures of her mother Terri Long, who died in a 7-Eleven ravaged by the powerful winds. Outside the convention center, the seniors from Southmoore, Westmoore and Moore high schools won't have to go far to be reminded of the devastation. Funeral homes and churches are busy with services for those killed. A balm after the storm . Ten of those killed were children, including seven second- and third-graders at Plaza Towers Elementary School. After three funerals earlier in the week, two more of those students were to be buried Saturday. Transforming Moore back into the city it had been won't be easy. Its public schools alone suffered $45 million in damage, including the two elementary schools that were leveled. Insurance claims related to Monday's storm will likely top $2 billion, according to Kelly Collins from the Oklahoma Insurance Department. But residents aren't doing it all alone. Honest advice from Joplin to Moore . Besides the presence of FEMA representatives and other public officials on the ground, they've had friends, relatives, even strangers come out to help. Sharon Liston has spent the last 25 years teaching math at Westmoore High, from which she's retiring after 40 years total in the profession. On Friday, a day before her school's graduation, a caravan of students arrived at her home to clean up her 3-acre property. ""It looked like a wall of students with trash cans and trash sacks, and they literally picked up every stick within that three acres there,"" Liston said. Principals recall day tornado hit . That kind of help makes it easier for Moore's residents to move on from this horrific week. Saturday's graduation ceremonies are similar, in that way. It means the end of one thing, and the beginning of another. A fresh start. ""It's just the closing of one chapter and the opening of another,"" Spradling said. ""...It's one of those flipping of the pages that means a lot to everybody here."" Tornado heading your way? Here's what to do . CNN's Eric Fiegel reported from Oklahoma, while Greg Botelho reported and wrote this story from Atlanta. CNN's Mariano Castillo contributed to this report.","NEW: People hold up picture of a graduate's mom who died in the tornado .

"(CNN) -- Smartphone makers have long touted the appeal of their high-definition display screens. Soon they'll be able to add high-definition sound to the mix, too. ""HD Voice,"" also known as wideband audio, is a technology designed to make a caller's voice, and other noises, sound on phone calls as close as possible to how they do in person. On Monday, AT&T Senior Vice President Kris Rinne confirmed that the company plans to roll out HD Voice later this year, making it the latest major player officially adopting a mobile feature that, unlike many in recent years, actually has to do with making phone calls. ""HD Voice is part of our voice-over-LTE strategy,"" said Rinne, speaking at the VentureBeat Mobile Summit in Sausalito, California, speaking of the next generation of cellular phone networks. In January, T-Mobile announced HD Voice was available on a handful of phones including the Samsung Galaxy S III and HTC One S. The carrier also said last month it will have HD Voice on the iPhone 5, to be rolled out on T-Mobile's networks in the U.S. for the first time later this month. Verizon has said it plans to implement the technology in 2014 and Sprint has said it plans to make HD Voice an option on the Sprint-exclusive HTC Evo 4G LTE. Mobile carriers now have the ability to improve sound quality by transmitting it over their 4G LTE networks, as opposed to the more limited telephone lines of the past. In simple terms, the human voice has a much wider frequency range than traditional phone connections have the bandwidth to handle. As a result, sounds that are too high or too low get compressed to fit. Wideband audio is, as its name suggests, wider than traditional voiceband. It's not as broad as the entire range of the human voice, but it's closer. It might take a while before our on-the-go conversations are pin-drop clear, though. For HD Voice to work, both phones need to be equipped to capture and transmit the higher-quality sound. And, at least initially, they'll need to be on the same network, though the carriers are working to expand that. Wireless carriers have been rolling it out elsewhere for a couple of years, but only now is the technology beginning to be offered nationally in the United States. When Apple unveiled the iPhone 5 in September, the company announced that the phone is equipped for HD Voice and that 20 carriers around the globe would have the ability to offer it. But while it's widely available in parts of Europe and elsewhere, the United States has been slow to catch up. Folks who have had a chance to test the feature have been impressed. PCMag's Sascha Segan tested out AT&T's version at the Consumer Electronics Show in January and called it ""really striking."" ""Background noise just drops out. The bustle of noises in a coffee shop? Gone. Airport PA announcements? Zapped,"" Segan wrote. ""Even in a quiet room, voices become much, much richer; I won't sound like a nasal Gollum any more. ""It's really lovely. ... But I've seen this demo a bunch of times before. I've seen this demo for two years. Someone needs to actually launch the service.""","HD Voice, which improves voice-calling clarity, is coming to more U.S. networks .

"(CNN) -- Four rockets struck strongholds of the militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon on Sunday, highlighting fears of sectarian tensions in the country that seem to mirror the strife in the Syrian civil war. The first two struck a predominately Shiite Beirut suburb of Dahiye, Lebanon's state news agency reported. One of the rockets injured five people, including three Syrians, the National News Agency reported. The number of casualties from the second one was not immediately known. Two more rockets pounded a residential area in the northern city of al-Hermel, also a Shiite neighborhood, causing property damage, NNA reported. Syrian rebels have shelled al-Hermel in the past, saying they are responding to military support of the Syrian regime by Hezbollah, which is a Shiite militia. Authorities have not identified any suspects in Sunday's attacks. Syria agrees 'in principle' to attend peace conference . Concerns that sectarian strife in Syria may trigger ethnic conflict within Lebanon's borders escalated Saturday, when Hezbollah declared it is going to war in Syria on behalf of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime. Lebanon's caretaker interior minister reflected the anxiety when he visited the site of Sunday's attack, which he called ""an act of sabotage to create tensions."" ""God willing, the events in Syria will not spill over into Lebanon, and we hope that we will have more men with more reason because we just went over 40 years of civil war,"" Marwan Charbel told NNA. At the same time, he emphasized that he does not know who is to blame for the attack. Like Syria, Lebanon's population is divided into religious and ethnic factions, some bitterly at odds with each other. Hezbollah is one of the largest and best armed factions. It draws most of its foreign support from Shiite-dominated Iran and from the al-Assad government in Syria, which the U.S. accuses of acting as a conduit for Tehran's weapons deliveries. His fighters have participated unofficially in towns close to Lebanon's border alongside Syrian government troops in battles against al-Assad's opponents. On Saturday, Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah promised al-Assad victory with Hezbollah's help. Nasrallah also called for his opponents in Lebanon to fight against Hezbollah on Syrian soil, hoping to divert armed conflict away from Lebanon and into the active battle field next door. ""We are fighting in Syria, so let us fight there instead and deflect Lebanon from the conflict, the fighting, the confrontations and the bloodshed,"" he said. Charbel acknowledged the dangerous potential in Lebanon's rising tensions. ""We are now living in an intolerable environment."" Hezbollah leader acknowledges fighters' presence in Syria town .

"(CNN) -- The couple who called police after being held hostage in Big Bear, California, by rogue ex-Los Angeles police officer Christopher Dorner will get a majority of the $1 million reward for information that led authorities to him. Karen Reynolds and her husband, Jim, called 911 on February 12 to report that Dorner had tied them up and stolen their car. They will receive 80% of the reward, put up by the city of Los Angeles with help from other jurisdictions, groups, and private donors. A panel of three judges awarded 15% to the Daniel McGowan, who discovered Dorner's burning truck near the ski resort town, and 5% to R. Lee McDaniel, who spotted Dorner on February 7 and informed police. The panel said nine other people who filed claims were not entitled to any reward money. The manhunt for Dorner ended when Dorner was cornered and died in the San Bernardino Mountains, about 100 miles east of the city where he once had been a police officer. The 33-year-old former Navy officer holed up in a cabin after a shootout with law enforcement. The renegade cop killed four people and wounded three others as part of a vendetta against his former comrades before apparently taking his own life.","Reward was offered by city of Los Angeles, other towns, counties .

"Paris (CNN) -- A French soldier who was stabbed Saturday on the western outskirts of Paris was targeted because of his military service, France's defense minister said. ""The aim was to kill the soldier because he was a soldier,"" Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told CNN affiliate BFMTV. The attacker wanted ""to kill a soldier who is in charge of French security,"" he said. The soldier was stabbed in the neck from behind with either a knife or a box cutter, a Hauts-de-Seine police spokesman said. The soldier, 23, was hospitalized with non-life-threatening wounds, the Ministry of Defense said in a statement. The attacker was wearing a robe and appeared to be North African, said Laurent Lefebvre, a spokesman for Syndicat Alliance Police Nationale, a French police union. Hauts-de-Seine police said they were screening surveillance video. The case has been passed on to anti-terrorism investigators in Paris. The soldier was on patrol as part of a heightened security plan initiated in certain areas following France's intervention in Mali earlier this year, French President Francois Hollande said. The attacker fled, triggering a manhunt, Interior Ministry spokesman Marie Murault said. The incident occurred late in the afternoon in the La Defense neighborhood as the soldier was on a joint patrol with police, the ministry said. It comes days after an attack in which a British soldier was hit by a car and hacked to death in southeastern London. Moments later, one of his alleged attackers was filmed saying the soldier was killed ""because Muslims are dying daily"" and that ""we must fight them as they fight us,"" in an apparent reference to British and allied forces' role in conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.

"(CNN) -- Amanda Bynes has had a rough few days -- some might say, a rough few months -- landing in jail after allegedly tossing a marijuana bong out of her 36th-floor New York apartment window. On Saturday, the 27-year-old actress took to Twitter with a simple message: ""Don't believe any reports."" And she didn't stop there. The New York police's story -- as related by spokesman Christopher Pisano -- is that officers were called Thursday to her abode in Manhattan's theater district after her building manager reported the 27-year-old was smoking an ""illegal substance"" in the lobby. Bynes had headed back to her apartment by the time police arrived, but she let officers in when they knocked on the door, according to Pisano. Once inside, the officers noticed a bong and other marijuana paraphernalia sitting on a coffee table, which Bynes immediately started to throw out a window. That account from police, Bynes insists, is ""all lies."" Amanda Bynes in trouble, again . Her story is that she was ""sexually harassed by one of the cops the night before last"" -- the same police officer who, she wrote, ended up arresting her. Bynes said she had opened her window ""for fresh air"" and didn't throw out any drug paraphernalia, claiming the officer ""lied"" when he claimed she did. Then, she alleged of the officer in her apartment, ""He slapped my vagina. Sexual harassment. Big deal."" Asked Saturday night about Bynes' claim the unnamed police officer had sexually harassed her, New York police Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne said: ""As it would with any such allegation, regardless of its credibility or lack thereof, the NYPD Internal Affairs Bureau is investigating it."" The actress had more to add. Bynes said she was handcuffed, ""which I resisted ... then I was sent to a mental hospital. Offensive."" The evolution of Amanda Bynes . ""The cop sexually harassed me, they found no pot on me or bong outside my window,"" Bynes tweeted. ""That's why the judge let me go."" Police charged her with tampering with physical evidence, reckless endangerment and criminal possession of marijuana, Pisano said. Bynes was charged with endangerment because the paraphernalia could have hit someone below. According to media reports, she appeared in court Friday and was then released until her next appearance in July. This week's ordeal is the latest of Bynes' run-ins with the law. She has a DUI case pending in Southern California, while a pair of separate hit-and-run incidents against her were dismissed late last year. Earlier this month, the actress was sentenced to three years probation for driving on a suspended license. Along the way, her once squeaky-clean image -- she was a young teenager when she burst on the scene as the lead in Nickelodeon's ""The Amanda Show"" -- has taken a hit. After that program, Bynes starred alongside Jennie Garth in the sitcom ""What I Like About You."" She later scored roles in movies, including ""Hairspray"" and ""Easy A.""

"(CNN) -- The names on the formal, state-government-erected memorial signs by the sides of Ohio highways are not famous to the outside world. But once you know the story behind them, you understand completely. You look at those signs and you offer a silent word of thanks. Usually stretches of highways around the country are named for politicians, or for renowned figures from American history, or perhaps for singing stars or athletes or Hollywood actors who were born in the area. For the last several years, though, whenever I've been in Ohio I have noticed the highway signs with the unfamiliar names. Last week I got in touch with the Ohio Department of Transportation to ask about them. The answer makes you want to pause humbly. On August 31, 2009, Marine Lance Cpl. David R. Hall, of Elyria, Ohio, was killed in an explosion while serving in Garmsir, Afghanistan. He was 31; he worked at a Ford assembly plant back home before joining the Marines. In most cases of fallen service members, there is a solemn funeral ceremony when their remains are returned home, and a respectful obituary in the local newspaper. It can feel all too fleeting. But in Ohio, in recent years, there has been an effort to do more. Which is why the Ohio General Assembly authorized that a stretch of State Route 2 in Lorain County -- David Hall's home county -- be named, now and forever, to honor him. ""After the General Assembly votes to name a portion of a highway, we manufacture the signs and put them up at the designated places,"" said Steve Faulkner, a spokesman for the Ohio Department of Transportation. He said that two signs are usually erected, each facing a different direction, so that people in cars on either side of the highway will see the honoree's name. Always, the memorial signs are placed in the service member's hometown or home county, so that friends and family members are reminded every day that the state and its citizens want to remember and salute him or her. Thus, Army Master Sgt. Shawn T. Hannon's portion of Interstate 71 runs through Grove City, Ohio. That is where he lived; he was 44 when, on April 4, 2012, he died of wounds caused by an improvised explosive device in Afghanistan. He was a long way from home, but back in Grove City now his old neighbors and buddies see his name and think of him each time they pull onto that part of the interstate. In the United States, there has grown to be a mercenary ritual around so-called naming rights. If there's a Major League Baseball park, an NBA or NHL arena, or an NFL stadium, corporations line up to bid for the opportunity to plaster their names on it. Airlines, financial services companies, big merchandisers -- all they have to do to get their names on the signs is come up with tens of millions of dollars. But the people with their names on the signs by the sides of Ohio's highways have paid a much, much higher price, for much less selfish reasons. And they are so deserving of the honor, which can't begin to repay the sacrifice they made. The most poignant thing about the placement of the signs is that almost invariably they are next to spans of road upon which the service members, when they were younger, drove their own cars: on the way to movies, on the way to dances, on the way to grab late-night burgers with their best hometown friends. Back then, they never could have imagined that the roads would before long bear their names, or why. But, while most of the rest of us during this last decade enjoyed life, or complained about it, inside America's borders, they crossed the oceans because their country said that it mattered. They didn't argue the politics of it. They answered the call. Thus, on this Memorial Day weekend, there is a bit of highway near Canton, Ohio, set aside for U.S. Marine Pvt. Heath D. Warner, 19, who died in combat in Iraq in 2006; on State Route 7 in Washington and Monroe counties there is a road for Army 1st Lt. Christopher N. Rutherford, 25, who died in Iraq in 2007; in Tuscarawas County is Army Cpl. Keith V. Nepsa's road, named for the 22-year-old who died when an IED detonated in Iraq in 2007; on State Route 322 in Chesterland is the portion of road for Army Chief Warrant Officer 2 Christopher R. Thibodeau, 28, who died in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan in 2011; on State Route 729 in Clinton County is the road honoring Marine Lance Cpl. William Brett Wightman, 22, killed in combat in Iraq in 2005; near Wilmington, on State Route 73, is Army Sgt. Steven D. Conover's road, honoring a hometown young man who was only 21 when he died during an attack in Iraq in 2003. The Ohio Department of Transportation's Faulkner told me that, because the authorizations from the General Assembly are sent over at widely spaced intervals, he did not have a readily available number of how many Ohio service members in America's recent wars have had portions of highways named for them. Reporter Robert Vitale of the Columbus Dispatch calculated that, as of last year, more than 70 Ohioans killed in the line of duty during the past decade had received the honor. Almost certainly there will be more; almost certainly the last highway sign has not been erected. But summer will be here soon. In Ohio, that is the time when long, leisurely drives along wide roads and narrow strips of blacktop can feel the most enticing. The sun is high in the sky; the nights are warm and lit by impossibly white stars. For those who left home never to return, those who once knew these highways by heart, the roads are now eternally theirs. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: In Ohio, highway signs memorialize soldiers felled in recent wars .
He says the Ohio General Assembly authorizes the signs; about 70 erected so far .
He says the signs for soldier's named are on highways near their hometowns .
Greene: Corporations pay millions to be named on signs; these soldiers paid dearer price ."
"(EW) -- Comedy sequels generally follow the law of diminishing returns. If it has a ""2""â€”or, classier yet, a ""II""â€”in the title, the smart money says that it won't be as funny as the original. ""Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues"" doesn't defy that axiom, but it's still plenty hilarious in a reheated sort of way. Will Ferrell may be our greatest conjurer of clueless cinematic blowhards â€” ""Talladega Nights'"" Ricky Bobby, ""Blades of Glory's"" Chazz Michael Michaels, and ""Austin Powers'"" un-killable, fez-wearing hitman Mustafa all come to mind. But I'd argue that his blow-dried teleprompter-reading newsboob, Ron Burgundy, is the most inspired creation to pop out of his beautifully deranged brain. With his polyester three-piece suits, Burt Reynolds porn 'stache, and inflated sense of self, he's pure Me Decade id. Or, as he likes to put it, ''I'm kind of a big deal.'' This week's cover: The Best and Worst of 2013 . The first ""Anchorman,"" released in 2004, was a perfectly-rigged slapstick machine loaded with indelible lines (''Milk was a bad choice!''). It was also the rare broad big-screen comedy that didn't feel stretched too thin like so many other ""SNL"" alumni flicks before it. It was a giddy send-up of the Carter era, turning a pompous, dim-bulb newsreader modeled after ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show's"" Ted Baxter into a harmless source of pants-wetting anarchy. In the sequel, ""The Legend Continues,"" the legend, well, pretty much continues. It's the early '80s and Ron and his on- and off-screen partner Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) are riding high. That is, until he gets sacked from his job by his imperious, old-school boss (Harrison Ford, the first of many great A-list cameos). Meanwhile, Veronica is promoted, sending Ron into a lather of jealousy that busts up their relationship. Before you know it, he's in exile, drunkenly emceeing a dolphin act at SeaWorld with his trusty mutt Baxter in tow. Ron doesn't have to wait long for a second chance, thanks to a fledgling 24-hour news channel called GNN that needs talking heads to fill up its graveyard time slot. Ron doesn't quite share the round-the-clock network's bold vision of the future, but ''by the hymen of Olivia Newton-John',' he's such a narcissist he needs to be on the air. So he takes the gig, hitting the road in his shag-carpeted RV to reunite his old news team: Paul Rudd's mutton-chopped muckraker Brian Fantana, David Koechner's casually racist sports reporter Champ Kind, and, of course, Steve Carell's imbecile meteorologist Brick Tamland. 100 most-watched shows on broadcast TV . In these early scenes, ""Anchorman 2"" has cheeky promise. The decade-specific song cues and sight gags come fast and furious ... and most of them land. But as things chug along and Ron and his posse start feuding with James Marsden's more polished news team (''I bet his poop smells like sandalwood''), the film starts to flag and feel a little too familiar, going through the same paces and beats established by the first film -- right down to a baroque battle royale in Central Park with a parade of rival TV news teams. It takes the same rumble scene from the original and cranks it up to eleven. Meagan Good is on hand as Ron's new boss at GNN, an ambitious African-American female producer that the hopelessly retro-chauvinist Ron can't wrap his head around. Meanwhile, Brick is given an equally socially awkward love interest (Kristen Wiig) that tends to stop the film in its tracks. The plot of the film involves Ron selling his journalistic soul (wait, did he ever have one?) by hyping sensationalistic stories like O.J.-style freeway chases and Fox News-esque appeals to flag-waving patriotism that will snag ratings and make him a big deal again. But ''by the bedpan of Gene Rayburn'' he comes to his senses before it's too late. Of course, the plot is pretty much beside the point in a film like this one. What we want are jokes that are as comforting and familiar as the laugh track on a sitcom rerun. ""Anchorman 2"" dutifully (sometimes hilariously) serves up those jokes even though we already know the punch lines. Grade: B . See the original story on EW.com.

"Rome (CNN) -- Pope Francis has appointed a group of eight cardinals from around the world to look into ways of reforming the Catholic Church, the Vatican said Saturday. The group, which includes U.S. Cardinal Sean O'Malley from Boston, will examine ways to revise the Vatican constitution, Pastor Bonus, which sets the rules for running the Roman Curia, or church hierarchy. The cardinals -- who come from North America, Latin America, Africa, Asia and Europe -- will first meet in October, the Vatican said. The move follows on from suggestions made during the General Congregations, a series of meetings that brought together all the cardinals last month before they elected Francis as pope, the Vatican said. The other seven cardinals are: Giuseppe Bertello, president of the Vatican City State governorate; Francisco Javier Errazuriz Ossa from Chile; Oswald Gracias from India; Reinhard Marx from Germany; Laurent Monsengwo Pasinya from the Democratic Republic of the Congo; George Pell from Australia; and Oscar Andres Rodriguez Maradiaga from Honduras. An Italian bishop, Monsignor Marcello Semeraro, will act as secretary for the group. Pope Francis has already been in touch with the chosen cardinals, the Vatican said. The Catholic Church has faced calls for reform in the wake of scandals involving the sexual abuse of children by priests and allegations of corruption. The Rev. Thomas Rosica, issuing guidance on behalf of the Vatican, said the group of cardinals was just that -- ""not a commission, committee or council."" It ""has no legislative power and its main function is to 'advise' the pope,"" he said. ""The group will not in any way interfere in the normal functions of the Roman Curia, which helps the Pope in the daily governance of the Church."" The group's formation, exactly a month after Francis was elected, shows that the pope ""listens attentively"" to what the cardinals say, Rosica said. The document the cardinals are studying is the Apostolic Constitution of Pope John Paul II, known as the Pastor Bonus, which was published in 1988. CNN Vatican analyst John Allen, who's also a correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter, wrote that the news was ""a signal that major reform may be on the horizon."" ""Strikingly, there was only one member of the Roman Curia among the eight cardinals tapped to assist the pope. The rest come from various parts of the world, with at least one representing each continent,"" he said. The group will be coordinated by Rodriguez, from Tegucigalpa, who speaks several languages and was himself seen as possible contender for the papacy. In Honduras, ""Rodriguez has long led the pack in terms of moral authority and social influence,"" Allen wrote in a profile ahead of the papal election, or conclave. CNN's Hada Messia reported from Rome and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London. Eric Marrapodi contributed to this report.","Pope Francis asks eight cardinals to look at ways to reform the Catholic Church .

"(CNN) -- Our failure to give women in certain parts of the world the ability to decide the timing and number of their children is deeply damaging -- not just for the women themselves but for societies, too. Lifting the obstacles is not something that can be tackled half-heartedly. Modern family planning programs were introduced widely in the developed world decades ago. Providing voluntary family planning is one of the most cost-effective ways of improving health. Yet, over 200 million women, overwhelmingly in the poorest countries, who want access to modern family planning still can't get this help. The results are all too clear. Girls who are still children themselves become mothers. The survival and health of mothers and babies are put at peril. Complications around giving birth remain the greatest killer of teenage girls in the developing world. It is not just young girls who suffer from the lack of control over their own reproductive health. Enabling women to space pregnancies out by three to five years could almost halve infant death in the poorest countries, one study found. The failure to give women access to reliable family planning increases poverty and reduces the number of girls in school and in the workforce. Lack of money to buy contraceptives, underfunding of family planning programs and lack of trained medical personnel are all major reasons that make life harder for women. There is no doubt, too, that cultural and family pressures -- often resting on a lack of women's equality within their homes and communities -- play a role. We have to lift these barriers wherever we find them. Opinion: Want to help poor moms? Provide them with diapers . Women have traditionally led the fight to improve access to family planning and the provision and quality of maternal health services. But the more we are able to recruit men and boys as full partners in this battle, the more progress we can make. While men, accidentally or deliberately, can be a barrier to these ambitions, I have also seen how they can be a major part of the solution in the unlikeliest societies. There are few countries with a poorer record on maternal and infant health than Niger, one of the least-developed nations. A traditional society where men wield most of the power, this landlocked nation in West Africa ranks at the bottom of the UNDP Gender Equality Index. Few women use contraceptives. Almost all births are at home. It helps explain why Niger has the highest fertility rate and one of the highest infant death rates in the world. Opinion: Why there are more walk-away moms . But a pioneering initiative launched in 2007, Schools for Husbands, is slowly changing this picture. These schools, which have the backing of the civil authorities, traditional and religious leaders, as well as UNFPA support, bring together husbands who believe their wives should play a much more equitable role in their families and communities. They meet regularly to discuss and deliver solutions to Niger's challenges around maternal and reproductive health. This can include building a house for a new community midwife or, after talking to local women's groups, new toilet facilities at a maternity clinic. Perhaps even more importantly, they take the message out to new communities about the importance of family planning and proper maternal health care.

"(CNN) -- More than 2 million U.S. troops have been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan since October 2001, and it has been estimated that one in five of those veterans are likely to be afflicted by post-traumatic stress disorder or major depression. Mary Cortani is working to help some of them enjoy life again. Through her nonprofit, Operation Freedom Paws, Cortani helps veterans train their own service dogs in northern California. She often helps match veterans with dogs from shelters or rescue groups. CNN asked Cortani for her thoughts on being chosen as one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2012. CNN: What do you hope this recognition will mean to Operation Freedom Paws? Mary Cortani: Since June, I have received emails and phone calls from all over the country asking for information on how to get service dogs for veterans. Some requests are coming from the veterans themselves, but most are coming from family members watching their loved ones struggle with PTSD, traumatic brain injuries and mobility issues. It's heartbreaking to learn about what these veterans and their families are going through, and even harder to hear their stories and know Operation Freedom Paws could help more of them if we had additional resources. I am hoping that with the recognition, we will (be able) to build the OFP Education Center and hire our mentor trainers, who are veterans that have completed or are completing the program. (We want to) put them and other veterans to work training others and expand into a national organization to help even more. But even more important, I hope it helps bring awareness to the issues that our veterans -- male and female -- face coming home injured. I hope it helps (our group) enlighten the public and government that service dogs can be a viable tool for assisting veterans, especially those suffering from PTSD and sexual trauma. The canine-human bond is an amazing gift that can make a difference for an individual to begin to feel and create their own new normal. How can we not support it? If we change just one life and make it better, why won't we? CNN: What was the reaction when you found out you were a top 10 CNN Hero? Cortani: This is an amazing journey. My life was already blessed, and this is icing on the cake. What an amazing group of people to be included with. I still cannot believe it is happening, and (I) have to pinch myself to know I'm not dreaming. This is not about me; it is about the veterans and the sacrifices that they and their families have made. This honor is for them. The veterans and clients that we work with every day are my heroes. The courage that they show every moment, just getting through the simple tasks or things that we take for granted, is my inspiration to keep moving forward and help even more. They do not even realize the strength they give me every day. Who should be the CNN Hero of the Year? Cast your vote now! CNN: How will you use the $50,000 award you receive for being selected as a top 10 CNN Hero? Cortani: I intend to continue using whatever funding and positive publicity comes our way to increase public awareness about veterans' invisible wounds and expand our service dog training programs. There are animals in shelters that will make outstanding service dogs, and there are veterans in desperate need of them. We just need to make the connections to start them on their path together toward a new normal. We will work toward building our new facility and helping more veterans and hiring veterans. CNN: What do you want people to know most about your work? Cortani: Conventional treatment is only part of the solution; we need to think outside the box and look at other treatments and tools that can help improve the quality of life for our veterans and others with disabilities. A dog that is highly trained to do specific tasks for an individual is one of those tools. The veterans still need the medical (treatment), but medical cannot address the spirit-soul. Therapy isn't there 24/7 -- a dog is. Combine what works, and maybe we can improve their quality of life. Service dogs work. Just ask any veteran who used to isolate (himself), get in fights, lost his family, had no hope for the future, thought about suicide -- they will tell you. We can make a difference, and we owe them a chance to enjoy life again. ... Being a veteran myself, I understand loss of purpose, the mission. Training their own service dog gives them that and more. It gives them a shot at a quality life again. Read the full story on CNN Hero Mary Cortani: . Man's best friend helping war veterans heal . More Q&As from top 10 Heroes: .

"(CNN) -- Congressional investigators are accusing the General Services Administration of violating its employee gift limit with rewards of iPods, digital cameras and other electronics, just as a video emerged of a lavish conference that shows employees drinking and making jokes about wasteful spending. The video, first obtained by The Huffington Post on Friday, offered a glimpse inside the agency's $820,000 conference in Las Vegas. An administration official confirmed the authenticity of the video and provided a copy to CNN. Reports of the lavish conference have prompted taxpayer outrage, embarrassed the administration and put a spotlight on the wasteful spending by the agency that acts as a real estate agency for the federal government. ""These videos reinforce once again the complete lack of judgment exhibited during the 2010 Western Regions Conference,"" said Greg Mecher, a GSA spokesman. ""Our agency continues to be appalled by this indefensible behavior, and we are taking every step possible to ensure that nothing like this ever happens again."" The latest news comes just days after the Office of the Inspector General documented massive overspending by the GSA. The fallout from the report's revelations has sparked a congressional investigation and seen the GSA chief step down, two other employees fired and a number of others suspended. On Friday, Republican investigators for the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee said the GSA's Public Buildings Service developed an employee incentive program known as the ""Hats Off Store"" that spent nearly $500,000 on gifts -- from iPods to GPS devices -- that vastly exceeded its $99 per-gift limit. They also said accounting for the gifts as well as the justification for giving them were lacking or inconsistent, according to a statement released by Rep. Jeff Denham, R-California, chairman of the Subcommittee on Economic Development, and Rep. John Mica, R-Florida, chairman of the transportation committee. While the investigation found the GSA's massive spending began in 2007 under the Bush administration and continued under the current leadership, Republican congressmen leading the investigation have hammered President Barack Obama over the allegations. ""More and more information is coming out about the total lack of accountability and outrageous spending habits of the General Services Administration,"" Denham said in the statement. Denham accused the administration of treating taxpayer dollars ""like their own private slush fund."" Meanwhile, House Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa, R-California, has accused the White House of sitting on the IG's findings about the GSA for 11 months. The administration has dismissed Issa's claims, saying the investigation followed proper procedures. The allegations Friday by Denham and Mica, and the video are likely to inflame the political divide. The video shows employees at the GSA's 2010 Western Regions Conference in Las Vegas putting on magic shows and singing Frank Sinatra songs. In one clip, a person dressed as a clown talks about making work more difficult for others. ""Government, if you think the problems we create are bad, just wait until you see our solutions,"" the clown warns the audience. The reports of overspending have prompted a bipartisan reaction, with Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-California, the chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, saying she will hold hearings on the GSA findings next week. CNN's Dana Bash, Brianna Keilar and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.","NEW: The General Services Administration is ""appalled"" by the video, a spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- Chinese human rights activist Chen Guangcheng arrived Saturday evening in the United States, bringing an end to a diplomatic firestorm that erupted after he escaped from house arrest and took to YouTube to complain about abuse he said his family suffered at the hands of authorities. United Airlines Flight 88 landed at New York/Newark Liberty International Airport to little fanfare after the U.S. State Department prohibited public and media access. Traveling with Chen were his wife and two children. Less than two hours later, Chen, 40, spoke from New York University, where he will participate in a fellowship. ""I am very grateful to the assistance of the American Embassy and the promise of the Chinese government for protection of my rights as a citizen over the long term,"" Chen said to a mob of reporters and onlookers. ""I am very gratified to see the Chinese government has been dealing with the situation with restraint and calm."" The activist indicated through a translator that the U.S. government granted him partial citizenship rights. He asked people to work with him to ""promote justice and fairness in China."" And Chen said he was looking forward to recuperating in ""body and spirit."" Reporters traveling with him were denied access to Chen for much of the 13-hour flight from Beijing until he agreed to talk to one member of the media. Chen expressed mixed feelings about arriving in the United States, saying he has unfinished business at home, according to CNN's Steven Jiang, who was on board the flight. Chen's 'concrete' steps to leaving China . Chinese-speaking diplomats from the U.S. Embassy in Beijing traveled with the family, according to two senior State Department officials. Chen had neither passport nor visa in hand when he was abruptly shuttled to the Beijing airport for the flight. At the airport, Chen waited with his wife and two children in a secure location. He was in a wheelchair, dark glasses over his eyes -- Chen is blind. Chen had been in a Chinese hospital for the past few weeks, awaiting the documents to travel to the United States. The self-taught legal activist angered Chinese officials with his fight against alleged forced abortions under China's one-child policy. Chen spent four years in prison, and was then held under constant lockdown in his village. In his April video after his escape, Chen addressed the Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, detailing alleged abuses during the family's 18 months of heavily guarded detention at home. ""They broke into my house and more than a dozen men assaulted my wife,"" he said. ""They pinned her down and wrapped her in a comforter, beating and kicking her for hours. They also similarly violently assaulted me."" On Saturday, Chen said he was confident officials will conduct a thorough investigation of the abuse and treatment toward him. ""I don't believe the central government will lie to me,"" he said. Journalists and supporters were prevented from visiting Chen during his house arrest. One of those supporters is Hollywood actor Christian Bale, who was roughed up by security guards while attempting a visit in December. Chen indicated Saturday he would like to meet Bale. Bale, in an e-mail Saturday to CNN, said, ""Please shake Chen's hand, and give him and his family a hug from me upon their arrival in the U.S. They must be overwhelmed with relief at being together, and finally, safe; but also worried about their family who remain in Shandong. I would love to meet with Chen when he has the time."" Chinese activists family suffers reprisals, he tells U.S. lawmakers . Bob Fu, president of ChinaAid, a Texas-based Christian human rights organization that has been campaigning for Chen's freedom, said the activist was deeply grateful to the international community's efforts to secure his freedom -- efforts that tested U.S. relations with the Communist giant. Chen spent six days in the U.S. Embassy after he escaped house arrest ahead of a visit to Beijing by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The move infuriated Chinese authorities. The one thing Chen could not leave behind was fear of reprisals for the rest of his extended family at the hands of the authorities in Shandong Province in eastern China. ""My elder brother was taken away by these thugs without any reasoning and then they came back and started beating up my nephew, and they used stakes and violently beat him up,"" Chen told the House Foreign Affairs Committee in a telephone call from his hospital room earlier this week. Chen added that his relatives' homes had been broken into and they had been beaten by people working for the government. Chen said his nephew Chen Kegui tried to defend himself and now faces a ""totally trumped-up"" charge of attempted homicide. ""After my nephew was beaten up, he actually was waiting to surrender himself and the police come back again and violently beat up my sister-in-law,"" Chen said. Hillary Clinton talks China, Chen in wide-ranging interview . The authorities in Linyi, the city that oversees Chen's village, had issued a statement accusing Chen Kegui of injuring government officials with a knife and saying he would be dealt with according to the law. They have declined to comment on the matter since. ChinaAid urged the international community to continue to monitor the situation for Chen's extended family in China, amid concerns over possible reprisals by the authorities. Amnesty International echoed that concern. ""Chen's journey to the United States would not have been possible without his own valiant character, the courageous support of his family and friends and the robust voice of the international community that never stopped working on his behalf,"" said Frank Jannuzi, head of Amnesty International's Washington office. ""But while Chen and his immediate family are safe, Amnesty International continues to be concerned about those in China who share his quest for justice, for they remain in serious jeopardy,"" he said. ""Countless people, known and unknown, are subject to arbitrary detention, beatings and other forms of repression. For Chen, whose escape from authorities in Shandong played out like a Hollywood thriller -- a persecuted blind man who climbed over a high wall and hid in a pig sty -- Saturday's sudden journey over an ocean and a continent was perhaps a fitting chapter in his story. Sunday morning, Chen will begin a new life in America, calm and resolute as always. New York University law professor Jerome Cohen first met Chen when the activist traveled to the United States as part of a State Department program in 2004. ""You got the feeling you were in the presence of some Chinese equivalent of Gandhi or something,"" Cohen said. ""He had this gentle but steely moral force."" Chen never sought out to be a rabble-rouser, Cohen said, though he will always be thought of as one. CNN's Steven Jiang contributed to this report.","Chen expresses gratitude, asks for justice in China .
Actor Christian Bale, who tried to visit Chen in China, wants to meet him in U.S.

"(CNN) -- Steven Soderbergh's movie ""Contagion,"" which opened in theaters Friday, speaks to globalization in an era when risk is shared by the entire planet, but benefits remain prioritized to exclusive, usually wealthy populations. This terrible global risk/benefit calculus means viruses may now swiftly enter every region of the world, but the protective gear, treatments and vaccines necessary to save lives remain primarily available to lucky residents of the United States, Canada, Western Europe, Japan and a handful of other countries. There is no governing structure for a pandemic, and little more than vague political pressure to ensure limited access to life-sparing tools and medicines for more than half the world population. ""Contagion"" is an action-thriller about the outbreak of a deadly virus. The producers behind ""Contagion"" asked me to serve as a consultant because I wrote ""The Coming Plague"" in the 1990s and worked as a reporter in at least 20 epidemics, including those of HIV in the 1980s, Ebola and SARS. From my very first meeting with ""Contagion"" director Soderbergh and screenwriter Scott Z. Burns, I stressed that the days when epidemics could be tackled locally had long passed. I argued that the movie had to demonstrate that disease threats in the 21st century are global threats, but the world lacks an appropriate system of governance and trade to permit a genuinely equitable response. Without equity, pandemic battles will fail. Viruses will simply recirculate, and perhaps undergo mutations or changes that render vaccines useless, passing through the unprotected populations of the planet. A man lucky enough to receive an effective vaccine against a new viral threat in Los Angeles may be re-exposed a year later to a mutated version of that germ that circulated among unimmunized populations in poor countries, only to slam North America in a second wave. That is what happened with influenza in 1918, which spread across Europe in a mild form, returning months later in its terrifying virulence and killing more than 50 million people (by recently adjusted estimates perhaps 100 million people). Those who see ""Contagion"" will recognize these themes in its plot: Chinese villagers clamor for vaccines, Internet users gravitate to false claims and order anything they think may help, the entire world sees the pandemic unfold on TV and the Internet and grows universally fearful. Fear spreads globally, even as governments fail in their ineptitude and exhaustion, with police, fire, public health and political leaders themselves falling victim to the virus. Drs. Larry Brilliant and Ian Lipkin, the other scientific consultants to ""Contagion"" and I did everything we could to make the movie accurate. But of course it is not a documentary, and the events depicted have, thankfully, not transpired. What audiences see is the best rendition of events likely to unfold in such a pandemic as can be estimated, based on how governments, public health leaders, scientists, drug companies, communities, law enforcement and international agencies have responded to recent outbreaks of less virulent germs. The hypothetical MEV-1 in ""Contagion"" is based in parts of the Nipah virus that first surfaced in Malaysia in 1998, the Chinese SARS outbreak of 2003, H1N1 swine flu in 2009, Ebola in Kikwit in 1995 and government reactions to the anthrax mailings of 2001. It is part fantasy, part reality and totally possible. As was believed by many in 2000 of the idea of al Qaeda successfully attacking the United States, and in 2004 of the likelihood the levees protecting New Orleans would collapse, the ideas shown in ""Contagion"" constitute a low probability event that would have high consequences. Assessing how likely such things as the 9/11 attack and Katrina are and determining how to prepare and respond are the jobs of government. But governance is a tricky concept. A country may be authoritarian, even brutal, but govern its infrastructure quite well. Of course, the preferred goal is democracy that is well guided, resilient and strong. We live in a time, however, when people are angry at their governments, both locally and nationally, and austerity is the maxim in all but the over-heated emerging markets of China, Brazil and perhaps India and Indonesia. ""Government"" is the official dirty word of most of the candidates for the Republican nomination for president of the United States. Internationally, mechanisms of global health governance are very weak. The World Health Organization is running a $1 billion budget deficit, laying off more than 20%, or 300, of its employees this year. Among the other players in the multilateral health picture only GAVI, the alliance responsible for child vaccinations, is financially stable and has vibrant leadership. Most other global health entities are struggling, both financially and politically. In the United States, politicians post-2001 grew tired of our Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, long the world's premier disease-fighter. As I delineate in my new book, ""I Heard the Sirens Scream: How Americans Responded to the 9/11 and Anthrax Attacks,"" political leaders blamed the CDC for failures in the response to the anthrax mailings. By the end of the Bush administration, Congress tilted in a new direction, demanding spending on obesity and diabetes. Under the Obama administration, the CDC is led by the very able Dr. Thomas Frieden, but congressional mandates have shifted its resources and focus from epidemics and outbreaks to obesity management and chronic disease issues. Billions of dollars were spent post-2001 to create systems of high security laboratories around the world, and stockpiles of vaccines and drugs. But the biggest chunk of change in that pursuit went for smallpox readiness, despite the dearth of evidence that al Qaeda or any other terrorist entity possessed smallpox with intent to use the germ as a weapon. All the fancy technology invented post-anthrax will be of little use against a previously unknown, novel entity as depicted in ""Contagion."" Moreover, technology for public health is useless if the workforce of doctors, nurses, lab technicians, scientists and other public health workers is weak. In these recessionary times, public health budgets are falling to budget axes from Maine to Manila. When moviegoers watch ""Contagion,"" I hope they will ask themselves a few very important questions and demand answers from their leaders. When an outbreak occurs, what agency is responsible for spotting it, assessing the threat and responding? If World Health Organization funding is diminished and its staffing cut, what organization deals with governing global responses and striving for equitable access to the treatments and vaccines? When lies and exploitation fill the internet, how can health leaders counter the deceptions, conspiracy theories and profiteering? When drug companies push pandemic exigencies aside amid concerns about profit-losses, what government can exert appropriate pressure to get billions of doses of drugs and vaccines made in a rapid, safe manner? ""Contagion"" should serve as a wake-up call not only about the germs, but perhaps more importantly about the frailty of governance, nationally and worldwide. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Laurie Garrett.","Laurie Garrett says movie ""Contagion"" shows global risk of pandemic shared by rich, poor .

"Washington (CNN) -- On the walls of Barbara Mikulski's Capitol hideaway are some of her most prized possessions -- portraits taken every two years of all the women in the Senate. The first picture from 1988 is Mikulski, a Democrat, and one other female senator, Republican Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas. ""The hemline's a little different, the hair color,"" Mikulski mused, staring at the photograph. ""That's when there were two."" The two forged a bond across party lines. The most recent picture, taken last year, features 17 female senators -- five Republicans and 12 Democrats. Mikulski remarks that there are more women in that photograph than had served in the Senate in all of American history when she arrived some three decades ago. The Maryland senator knows a lot about the history of female lawmakers, and she should. She has made a lot of it herself: the first Democratic woman ever elected to the Senate in her own right; the first woman in the Senate Democratic leadership; and in late 2010 she became the longest-serving woman ever in the Senate. On Saturday she will top that, becoming the longest-serving woman ever in the history of the U.S. Congress, surpassing Rep. Edith Norse Rogers of Massachusetts, who represented Massachusetts from 1925 to 1960. To mark the milestone, she invited three other women senators who span parties and generations, to talk about what Senate women call their ""zone of civility."" Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Republicans Olympia Snowe of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska joined Mikulski to sit at a table that came from her childhood home and explained how hard the women of the Senate work to maintain a lost dynamic in Congress these days: comity. Ironically, it is a relic of the old boys network that doesn't really exist anymore in today's era of partisanship: Get to know each other personally, so they can work better together professionally. Regular dinners across party lines . It starts with regular dinners organized by Mikulski, whom some call the ""Dean,"" others call ""Coach Barb."" ""When the day's over, let's kick back and put our lipstick on and have a glass of wine, and keep the institution and America going,"" Mikulski said. Though the dinners are strictly off the record, the senators spilled a few details. ""We talk about our families, our concerns in our lives. Sometimes we talk about what we are working on but it's a very collegial setting where we are trying to cultivate friendship first and foremost,"" said Gillibrand, who jokes they ""rarely get nights off anyway, so that's our big night out."" Snowe, a moderate Republican who recently made a surprise announcement that she is retiring because she is fed up with the polarization in Congress, said, ""We made the commitment to do it on a monthly basis, and to get together because it's critical, and we naturally bond, and we have an opportunity to let our hair down."" Murkowski said when her husband sees one of the Senate women dinners on the calendar, he knows it's non-negotiable. ""He doesn't say, 'My gosh, why are you at work so late tonight?' He knows that that is a time that I value because I derive so much from the conversation, from the camaraderie that we have in the hour and a half at the end of a very long day, so I make it a priority when the dinners are scheduled to be there and enjoy that conversation with friends,"" Murkowski said. Mikulski notes that the Senate can be a ""lonely place,"" so the dinners are a refuge with ""no agenda, nothing to prove [except] finding common ground where we're going to talk about what we're going to work on in other committees or circumstances."" ""I think it's a place that gives us energy, gives us a sense of our own community and we all really do know we can count on each other if something comes up we would be the first there,"" Mikulski said. A bipartisan sisterhood . But does this bipartisan sisterhood translate into bipartisan legislative action? Murkowski replied that just this past week she was able to work out differences in the highway bill with Barbara Boxer, the Democrat overseeing it, primarily because of their personal friendship. Gillibrand recalled getting tremendous help from Snowe and Murkowski on the 9/11 first responders legislation. ""I remember when I was trying to so hard to pass the 9/11 health bill, both Lisa and Olympia were encouraging me. They said we're not going to be name sponsors in the bill for instance, but we believe in what you are doing, and I think that if you approach it a, b and c, you'll be more effective,"" Gillbrand remembered. ""I think we're just natural allies and we trust each other. It's almost instinctive,"" Snowe said, turning to Gillibrand, ""I can remember the conversations that we had. She was eliciting ideas about how to advance the bill, and so we trust another to give solid advice and to take that advice."" ""We are all a team as women. We may not agree on every issue but that's not the point,"" Snowe continued. ""We know how to work together in the give and take of it and achieve results."" Murkowski offered another explanation for what makes Senate women different from the men: ego. ""I don't think that we have as much ego attached with who's getting the credit,"" said Murkowski, who noted that oftentimes with the men, it's ""my way or the highway."" ""We're all pretty competitive or we wouldn't have gotten here in the first place, but in order to achieve the results that we are looking for, I think there is less personal ego on the line,"" she said. There is also another female trait that factors in here. They all say they instinctively know how to listen. ""I think it is how we communicate the message and how we listen to what is being communicated. And I think that the listening part of it is an important part of how we get the results,"" Murkowski said. Four generally agree on women's issues . Though they differ on everything from taxes to energy policy, they generally agree on women's issues. But Lisa Murkowski recently voted with fellow Republicans against free access to contraception. Women back home in Alaska got upset, and she said she regretted her vote. Asked if any of her female colleagues went to her and urged her not to side with her party on this one, Murkowski made clear the answer was no. ""I wish that we had had that discussion, I can honestly tell you that,"" she said, and then ripped into the GOP on the issue. ""I think that my party is in an unfortunate place right now as viewed by many women in this country who are feeling very anxious about what they believe to be attacks on women's health,"" she said. In a bitterly partisan era, Senate women cherish this cross-party sisterhood. Columnist Margaret Carlson wrote recently in the Daily Beast that Senate men complain they no longer have time to forge such relationships. She joked that Senate women somehow do it, and it's certainly not like they get more time in the day from their extra X chromosome. ""If anything, these women have more demands upon them,"" said Mikulski, who notes Gillibrand has two young sons and Murkowski is the mother of teenagers. ""I had to make school lunch this morning,"" Gillibrand chimed in, laughing. They talk surrounded by Mikulski's female-oriented memorabilia adorning her walls: a poster of Geraldine Ferraro, the first female vice presidential candidate; a photograph with Madeleine Albright before she was appointed the first female secretary of state; even a picture of the Girl Scouts. Mikulski's female colleagues credit her with cultivating and maintaining these relationships, and say she starts by mentoring new Senate arrivals. ""I remember when I first got appointed, she was one of the first to ask me to visit her, gave me guidance on how things work, how to pass legislation,"" Gillibrand recalled. After 12,858 days of service, that makes her the longest-serving woman in congressional history, it's abundantly clear that creating a collegial oasis for women inside the intensely partisan atmosphere is one of her proudest accomplishments. ""I won't always be here, but I hope the legacy of civility, that I've worked with the other women to create will remain,"" she said. CNN producers Laurie Ure and Ted Barrett contributed to this report .","Mikulski will become the longest-serving female member of Congress on Saturday .

"Washington (CNN) -- Another government official was placed on administrative leave Monday in the continuing fallout over wasteful spending involving a 2010 Las Vegas conference for government workers, the General Services Administration announced. David Foley, a deputy commissioner of the Public Building Service in the GSA, was identified by a House oversight panel as the official seen in video footage from the conference appearing to make light of congressional oversight. According to an administration source who spoke on condition of not being identified, Foley became the eighth member of the GSA staff to be fired, placed on leave or otherwise removed from their job because of the controversy, . The announcement by GSA spokesman Adam Elkington came after Monday's release of additional video footage involving the 2010 Western Regions Conference, this time showing government workers mocking a clean energy campaign pushed by President Barack Obama. The video clip, made available by a Republican-led House oversight committee, shows GSA workers promoting the ""go green"" campaign, singing along to a gospel-style tune. One line of the song says ""POTUS wants a press event, a project he can show,"" while a worker holds up a portrait of Obama. POTUS stands for ""president of the United States."" The workers' video was submitted for an awards competition at the 2010 conference, and accompanying footage of the awards ceremony shows a GSA official saying the video included any workers who were in the office on the day it was made. Reports of the lavish conference have prompted taxpayer outrage, embarrassed the administration and put a spotlight on wasteful spending by the agency, which acts as a real estate agency for the federal government. An inspector-general's report issued last week that detailed the excesses of the $820,000 conference brought the resignation of GSA chief Martha Johnson, after she fired two top officials. In addition, congressional investigators are accusing the GSA of violating its employee gift limit with rewards of iPods, digital cameras and other electronics. With the agency coming under fire, an Obama administration source told CNN that the budget for the biennial conference ballooned during the Bush administration, growing from just under $94,000 for the 2004 event in Portland, Oregon, to just over $655,000 by the 2008 confab in New Orleans. By comparison, the source said, the tab for the 2010 conference was only 28% higher than 2008. But a spokeswoman for the Republican-led House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which has scheduled a hearing on the GSA for Monday, dismissed the argument. ""It's certainly important to understand whether increased costs in past years were used for real work and offset elsewhere or if increases were attributable to the kind of lavish spending that occurred in 2010 on parties, clowns, mind readers, commemorative coins and music videos done on official time,"" committee spokeswoman Becca Watkins said. But she added, ""These statistics have been pushed by anonymous voices that have so far refused to provide critical details and context in the midst of their efforts to blame the Bush administration for abuses that occurred in 2010."" Watkins said the committee, led by California Rep. Darrell Issa, ""has requested that GSA deliver information about previous conferences, including their cost and the number of individuals who attended."" The GSA has denounced the actions of those who put on the 2010 conference and were depicted in a series of video clips made public in the past week. ""These videos reinforce once again the complete lack of judgment exhibited during the 2010 Western Regions Conference,"" Elkington said Monday. ""Our agency continues to be appalled by this indefensible behavior, and we are taking every step possible to ensure that nothing like this ever happens again."" On Friday, Republican investigators for the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee said the GSA's Public Buildings Service developed an employee incentive program dating back several years known as the ""Hats Off Store"" that spent nearly $500,000 on gifts -- from iPods to GPS devices -- that vastly exceeded its $99-per-gift limit. The investigators also said that accounting for the gifts, as well as the justification for giving them, was lacking or inconsistent, according to a statement released by Rep. Jeff Denham, R-California, chairman of the Subcommittee on Economic Development, and Rep. John Mica, R-Florida, chairman of the Transportation Committee. While the investigation found the GSA's massive spending began in 2007 under the Bush administration and continued under the current leadership, Republican representatives leading the investigation have hammered Obama over the allegations. Meanwhile, Issa has accused the White House of sitting on the inspector general's findings about the GSA for 11 months. The administration has dismissed Issa's claims, saying the investigation followed proper procedures. Issa and Mica plan congressional hearings on the issue next week. Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer, the chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, says she also will hold hearings on the GSA findings next week. Elkington said the GSA welcomes ""responsible oversight"" and ""remains committed to eliminating excessive federal spending and promoting government efficiency.""

"(CNN) -- Art Ginsburg, who as ""Mr. Food"" demonstrated recipes and cooking tips in 90-second segments for millions of TV viewers over more than 30 years, died Wednesday of cancer, a company official said. Ginsburg, 81, died at his home in Weston, Florida, said Howard Rosenthal, an executive at Ginsberg's Florida-based Mr. Food Brand. Ginsburg, whose syndicated ""Mr. Food"" segments were shown on more than 125 television stations nationwide as of June, was known to enthusiastically sign off with his signature phrase, ""Ooh, it's so good!"" ""What you saw on TV was how Art was off TV,"" Rosenthal said. Ginsburg's ""commitment to anyone-can-do recipes and passion for helping others made him well-loved among his peers and among television viewers and website visitors,"" a message on the ""Mr. Food"" website said. ""He was one of the first television celebrity chefs and paved a road for many who came after him."" Ginsburg worked as a butcher and owned a catering business before debuting a cooking segment on a TV talk show in upstate New York in 1975. He began self-syndicating a 90-second ""Mr. Food"" TV segment to nine television markets in 1980. King World Productions -- now CBS Television Distribution -- began syndicating him in 1982, his company's website says. He established his own company, which by 1994 had a TV studio, a test kitchen and publishing offices in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. His company has produced more than 50 cookbooks by 2009.

"Wellington, New Zealand (CNN) -- You'd have to have been hiding down a, er, Hobbit hole, to miss the hubbub. You can fly to New Zealand, where the Hobbit premieres on Wednesday, on a Hobbit-branded plane -- complete with a Hobbit-inspired safety video with Peter Jackson, telling you how to keep safe, if the flight approaches its own Mount Doom. When you arrive in the self-styled Middle (Wellington, my home town) of Middle Earth, a giant Gollum, reaching for a fish, hangs from the airport terminal's ceiling. On the short ride into the city you'll see the Hobbit-themed flags fluttering in Wellington's persistent wind before a giant Gandalf hovers into view. He is perched on the Embassy theatre's verandah, standing outside a delightfully rendered Hobbit hole, waiting to welcome the stars and thousands who will watch them parade down the red carpet. Will the movie receive critical acclaim -- or Jar Jar Binks reception? Whatever happens, the marketing has been brilliant. New Zealand's taxpayers have been helping subsidize 14%, or US$82M, of the films (which cost close to NZ$700M, or US$575M). While the Kiwi psyche adores nothing more than being told how wonderful our little country is, we need more than that as a return on our investment. Prime Minister John Key, who helped woo the Warner Bros executives when they threatened to film elsewhere, has said it's good value for money because it's far less than the NZ$300m (US$246M) the Lord of the Rings trilogy cost the country. He argues it is all money well spent on creating jobs and that the cross-promotional benefits will return a treasure to please even Smaug the dragon. Peter, meanwhile, has popped out of the editing room in the past few days to remind everyone that the subsidies helped ensure that the films were made here. Big studios do not make decisions based on ""sentimentality,"" he said, and there was a real danger of the films being shot in England or Scotland. God forbid. Stars, fans turn out in droves for 'The Hobbit' premiere . There have been many benefits besides the jobs -- such as celebrity spotting. Orlando Bloom ate across from us one night -- he was quite underwhelming, short, plain and, worse, minus Miranda Kerr. He really needs that blond hair-do to give him a lift. We also spotted James Nesbitt (who plays a dwarf) having a nice time with his family at a Mexican joint near Peter's burgeoning studio complex. He even appeared relaxed about sitting by the loo -- quite handy because I kept swinging past to see what they were up to. Many more Kiwis will be waiting by the red carpet, hoping for their own little bit of movie tinsel. They deserve to be treated to a show, as they've certainly paid enough of their share of the admission already.","""Middle of Middle Earth"" greets arrivals with Gollum, Hobbit-themed flags, Gandalf .

"(CNN) -- More than a music producer, singer-rapper, composer and designer, Pharrell Williams is an expressionist -- a person fully immersed in the worlds of art and culture. His new coffee-table book, ""Pharrell: Places and Spaces I've Been,"" shares his insightful conversations with cultural influencers such as Jay-Z, Anna Wintour, Zaha Hadid, Buzz Aldrin and Kanye West, to name just a few. Williams recently spoke with CNN about his book, the people who have influenced him and his upcoming projects. CNN: What motivated you to write ""Pharrell: Places and Spaces I've Been""? Pharrell Williams: The motive was to share with everyone, both the people and the moments that inspired me to continue to express myself. ... I wanted to share with people ... the way that they would talk and the things that they would say. CNN: Speaking of the people who have inspired you and pulling from the book's themes, discuss the conversation you had with artists like Jay-Z. Williams: You know, the whole Jay-Z interview is interesting, but what's more interesting is his perspective as it relates to the kind of work and the standard that he created in his music. ... When you look at his perspective and his views on things and then you look at his work, you can sort of induce how he gets things done. CNN: Outside of being influenced by a diverse group of artistic professionals, you're an influencer yourself. Miley Cyrus has been in and out of your Miami studio. In Marie Claire, you were quoted saying you wanted to ""free"" the now grown-up singer. Were you able to do so? Williams: Well, I didn't free her. She freed herself. And that's the only freedom that I could ever offer anyone -- is the acknowledgment that you can set yourself free. ... She's allowing herself to just be who she wants to be and not feeling like she has to ration herself to a grid that is what everyone else deems as ""the perfect American."" She doesn't really want to be ""the perfect American."" She just wants to be the perfect version of herself. And she encourages other girls to do the same thing. CNN: What can we expect from the Miley-Pharrell collaborative record(s)? Williams: We don't like to do a lot of talking about what it's gonna do or what it's gonna be. It's just -- it's good stuff man. CNN: In the book, Kanye West talked about his state of musical creativity at a particular time. What are your thoughts on music's progression? Williams: I think music follows the trends of the collective conscious. I would urge someone when they read the Kanye one, again read it and look at his views ... look at his values and see where he values things and then listen to his music and you can basically see what his mind is like. That's what ""Places and Spaces"" was supposed to do -- it was supposed to give people a glimpse into the minds of the people who inspired me, and when I got inspired, it was because I would look at the things that they would say and I would look at the things that they would do. And somewhere in between there, I got a feeling for who those people really were. CNN: On your expansion as a musician to now a composer, you've produced the soundtrack for the 3-D animated film ""Despicable Me"" and scored the 2012 Academy Awards alongside Hans Zimmer. Will you be composing more? Williams: Yes! The new '""Despicable Me 2"" is coming. It's incredible. I got to keep up with it -- what they're doing visually; I have to keep up with it musically. ... It's very inspiring and the music that it's inspired me to make is crazy; it's like something I've never done before. I would say there are a couple of other things in that realm as well. I don't like to (talk too much about it); I just like to blast it. CNN: You talk a lot about your inspiration. What is currently influencing you? Williams: (Pauses) Influencing me? Right now, musically I'm inspired by everyday people. Music is all of a sudden much more colorful. ... The element of harmony is super important. ... I suppose that's why it feels so great. It's just been interesting to see this new change in direction for me. CNN: While we have yet to hear the new music you've been creating -- early October you caused a Twitter frenzy among fans when you tweeted a photo of you, Frank Ocean and Jay-Z in the studio. Williams: (Laughs) I love music man. That's all I can say. I love music. CNN: In your book, you talk about the places and spaces you've been. Where exactly are you going next Mr. Williams? Williams: (My team and I are) only headed up. (Chuckles) Everything. Television, video games, products. We're only headed up. It's the only way we know.","The musician and producer has written ""Pharrell: Places and Spaces I've Been""

"(CNN) -- I was recently diagnosed with brain cancer. This was shocking news. Sitting across from a doctor holding a clinical folder with your name on it, and hearing him say the words ""low-grade glioma,"" ""language and comprehension areas of your brain,"" ""surgery"" and ""chemotherapy"" is a very weird experience. My first idea was to seek other opinions. Maybe this hospital is wrong. Maybe there are other places that wouldn't need to do surgery. Maybe there is a laser, a chemical, an ancient tradition, a shaman, a scientist, a nanorobot. I felt incomplete about the way that the medical system was handling my situation. Being ""diseased"" is like a state of suspended life. Can I work? Have fun? Be creative? Not really. When you are declared ""diseased,"" you become a set of medical records, therapy, dosages, exam dates. It's as if you disappear, replaced by your disease. I immediately asked for my clinical records in digital format, and left the hospital. TED.com: A new understanding of cancer . My main objective -- the best thing I felt that I could do -- was to make my digital information available on the Internet, in formats that would allow people of multiple cultures, skills, professions and inclinations to access, use, recombine and redistribute it. Why would I want them to access this information? To help me find the best cure for myself, and in the process to produce substantial social change by redefining the word ""cure."" But when I went home to publish my medical records, all I could do was send them to specialized professionals, either by duplicating the CDs and mailing them or by copying their closed format and uploading them somewhere. I had no direct access to my own information, since I use Linux and OSX rather than the files' Windows-based viewer. As a software engineer, I found software and programming tools to hack the files and make them open -- but a nontechnical person would have difficulty making use of their own medical data. I needed, first of all, something which I could easily share, maybe allowing people to open it from their browsers, or even from their smartphones. TED.com: New strategy in war on cancer . So I opened up my medical records and converted the data into multiple formats: spreadsheets, databases, metadata files in XML and video, image and sound files. And I published them on The Cure. The responses have been incredible. More than 200,000 people have visited the site and many have provided videos, poems, medical opinions, suggestions of alternative cures or lifestyles, personal stories of success or, sadly, failures -- and simply the statement, ""I am here."" Among them were more than 90 doctors and researchers who offered information and support. The geneticist and TED fellow Jimmy Lin has offered to sequence the genome of my tumor after surgery -- in an open-source platform, of course. And the Italian parliament has been debating a motion to make all patients' medical records more open and accessible, which would be amazing progress in my country. Within one day I also heard from two different doctors, who recommended similar kinds of surgery. The first version is ""awake surgery,"" which monitors the brain in real time as different parts are touched. The second is a variation in which electrodes are placed on the brain during surgery, and then a brain map is produced (with the patient awake) and used during a second surgery (with the patient fully unconscious). TED.com: Your genes are not your fate . Existing portals and websites that allow patients and ex-patients to exchange stories and opinions already exist. But we're talking about something different. I see a cure as a dynamic process, in which multiple doctors, professionals, artists, scientists and others join as a society -- to converse, support each other, be open to various contributions and shape solutions that merge humanity, technology, technique, philosophy and art. Creativity and ""normal life"" become part of the process and bring ""diseased"" people back to life. To me, a true cure is complete, is human, and has dignity. And it never ends. Such a cure is a dialogue in which ""experts"" maintain their status -- and in fact, an enormous thank you goes out to all the extremely qualified professionals who are constantly responding to my calls -- but the whole process opens up to possibility. TED.com: The potential of regenerative medicine . And this is exactly what is happening: We are creating a cure by uniting the contributions of surgeons, homeopaths, oncologists, Chinese doctors, nutritionists and spiritual healers. The active participation of everyone involved -- both experts and ex-patients -- is naturally filtering out any damaging suggestion which might be proposed. To achieve this kind of cure, we must be open to strategies from different cultures and philosophical orientations. And we must embrace a wider, more profound discourse about the ways in which information circulates digitally. For now, I'm following a complex strategy developed with the help of a series of doctors and experts who responded to my open-source cure site and have suggested a variety of therapies to deal with the disease. As of now, my cancer growth has stopped. We are waiting for the next test results to decide when and if to proceed to surgery. How can you be involved? Tell us about excellent techniques and technologies from around the world that can effectively confront low-grade glioma. We have explored many opinions in Italy and Europe, but fewer outside. Share your stories and experiences, the solutions you have found, the fraud you have encountered. Send us videos, poems, images, audio or text that you see as relevant to a scenario in which art and creativity can help form a complete and ongoing cure. Or tell us, ""I am here!"" -- alive and connected, ready to support a fellow human being.

"(CNN) -- Andrew Breitbart, the conservative blogger whose posting of a sexually explicit photo of former U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner led to the congressman's downfall, has died, his attorney confirmed Thursday. He was 43. Joel Pollak, editor-in-chief and in-house counsel for Breitbart's website, Breitbart.com, posted a statement confirming his death. ""Andrew passed away unexpectedly from natural causes shortly after midnight this morning in Los Angeles,"" the statement read. ""We have lost a husband, a father, a son, a brother, a dear friend, a patriot and a happy warrior."" Ed Winter, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Coroner, said Breitbart was pronounced dead 19 minutes after midnight at UCLA Medical Center. An autopsy is planned for Friday, Winter said, but the Los Angeles Police Department said it is not investigating the circumstances of his death. Compassion and politics: Strange bedfellows . Breitbart was the first to post Weiner's infamous Twitter photos last year, in which the married congressman appeared barechested and in his underpants in pictures sent to a woman online. Weiner eventually stepped down amid the scandal. Breitbart's regular appearances on FOX News, his websites and his speeches to conservative groups made him a star on the right and a villain to the left. Republican presidential candidates quickly responded to news of Breitbart's death. Former Sen. Rick Santorum called him a ""powerful force"" who was ""constantly out there driving and pushing."" ""What a huge loss, in my opinion, to our country and certainly to the conservative movement,"" Santorum said. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich tweeted: ""Andrew Breitbart was the most innovative pioneer in conservative activist social media in America. He had great courage and creativity."" And former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney called Breitbart a ""brilliant entrepreneur, fearless conservative, loving husband and father."" Breitbart was a driving force in the conservative tea party movement. In a posting on the Tea Party Nation website, blogger Judson Phillips wrote that Breitbart was an ""amazing patriot"" who ""relished fighting those who would destroy this great country."" Texas Gov. Rick Perry, a former GOP presidential contender, said Breitbart ""fought for what he believed in, exposing government corruption and media bias. His spirited voice will be missed, but not forgotten."" Breitbart came under heavy criticism in 2010 for posting an edited and incomplete video of a speech by Agriculture Department employee Shirley Sherrod, who is black, appearing to say she discriminated against a white farmer looking for assistance. Sherrod was forced to resign over the video, which appeared on another of Breitbart's websites, BigJournalism.com. A full version of the speech showed that Sherrod had assisted the farmer. The department later offered her job back when it was clear she had been misrepresented. Sherrod issued a brief statement Thursday saying only she was surprised by the news and that her prayers go out to Breitbart's family. Opinion: How Andrew Breitbart changed news . ""The news of Mr. Breitbart's death came as a surprise to me when I was informed of it this morning. My prayers go out to Mr. Breitbart's family as they cope during this very difficult time."" Breitbart also posted video of a sting operation against the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, or ACORN, which showed conservative activists posing as a pimp and a prostitute seeking advice on how to set up a brothel. The video prompted a groundswell of action against the organization, including a limited investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice and a slashing of funds from the federal government and several states. ACORN went bankrupt and closed its doors. Breitbart got his start helping to run the original right-wing online media behemoth the Drudge Report and helped launch The Huffington Post before founding his own websites. Drudge Report founder Matt Drudge on Thursday said Breitbart was a ""constant source of energy, passion and commitment"" in the site's early days and that the two ""shared a love of headlines, a love of the news, an excitement about what's happening."" The statement on Breitbart.com Thursday included a portion of the new conclusion he wrote to his book, ""Righteous Indignation"": . ""I love my job. I love fighting for what I believe in. I love having fun while doing it. I love reporting stories that the Complex refuses to report. I love fighting back, I love finding allies, and -- famously -- I enjoy making enemies. ""Three years ago, I was mostly a behind-the-scenes guy who linked to stuff on a very popular website. I always wondered what it would be like to enter the public realm to fight for what I believe in. I've lost friends, perhaps dozens. But I've gained hundreds, thousands -- who knows? -- of allies. At the end of the day, I can look at myself in the mirror, and I sleep very well at night."" CNN's Stan Wilson, Mark Preston, Richard Allen Greene, and Rachel Clarke contributed to this report.","Breitbart was known for posting the Anthony Weiner Twitter photos last year .

"(CNN) -- Award-winning newsman Richard Threlkeld, whose wide-ranging career took him from war zones to presidential campaigns, was killed Friday in a car accident on New York's Long Island, authorities said. He was 74. Threlkeld, who worked for CBS and later ABC, died after his 2008 Mini Cooper collided with a tanker truck in Amagansett, East Hampton police said in a statement. The cause of the accident remains under investigation, the statement said. The driver of the tanker, 57-year-old Earl Fryberger Jr. of Coatesville, Pennsylvania, was uninjured, it said. Threlkeld's career took him from the jungles of Vietnam to the desert of Iraq during the Gulf War, from courtroom trial of Patty Hearst to the execution of Gary Gilmore. Threlkeld joined CBS News in 1966 and jumped to ABC in 1981. He returned to CBS in 1989 before retiring in 1998, according to the network. ""We liked him because he was a gentleman. We admired him because of what he could do with words,"" CBS Evening News' anchor Scott Pelley said during Friday's broadcast. Pelley described Threlkeld as a ""reporter's reporter, writing with speed and accuracy, delivering insight on deadline."" Threlkeld is survived by his wife, Besty Aaron, two children and two grandchildren. Aaron worked as a correspondent for CNN and CBS.

"(Wired) -- All indicators suggest Apple will unveil the iPad 3 during the first week of March. That's less than a month away, and sources at The Next Web say Apple is in ""crunch mode,"" working hard to line up apps that show off the unique features of the next-gen tablet. The iPad 3 is expected to feature a high-definition, 2048 x 1536 ""retina display."" If the new screen does appear in Apple's big reveal, it should provoke all the excitement of the company's first retina display, which appeared in the iPhone 4 in 2010. According to a source who spoke with The New York Times, the next iPad's screen will be ""truly amazing."" So which apps might Apple use to show off the brilliance of its new display hardware? We've identified four key app categories that would be ideal for demo'ing the HD display. We've also spoken to software developers about their iPad 3 aspirations. None would spill any beans concerning launch-day involvement, but we did learn more about how the developer community is anticipating the new display. Photography . Apps for shooting and viewing photographs would be ideal for showing off not only a high-resolution display, but also an improved camera, which is also a highly likely upgrade. iOS 5 has a hidden panorama mode that developers haven't yet been able to take advantage of. So, if an iOS update accompanies the iPad 3 launch, we might expect Apple to finally show off panorama mode in conjunction with an improved rear-facing camera. (The current iPad 2 camera is merely iPod touch caliber.) And if Apple doesn't want to show off its own panorama capabilities, apps like TourWrist and 360 Panorama would be great candidates to show off such a feature. TourWrist CEO Charles Armstrong is so confident that Apple will be doubling the number of pixels in the height and width of its next tablet, his team is already preparing a new version of its app. ""It's four times as many pixels. That makes logical sense, and that's what we're anticipating."" As for viewing images, something like Fotopedia would be a great app for Apple to showcase at the iPad 3 demo. Essentially a depository of mind-blowing photojournalism, Fotopedia won the Tablet App of the Year award at 2011′s Crunchies Awards (Silicon Valley's version of the Oscars). The app is broken down into various themed collections (e.g., Dreams of Burma, National Parks and, most recently, Women of the World), each full of stunning full-screen images. ""We love Apple, we only build apps for iOS,"" Fotopedia senior vice president Christophe Daligault told Wired. ""We basically will be ready with very high-quality, high-definition content as soon as a higher-resolution iPad comes out,"" he said. Daligault added it would only take a few weeks to tweak Fotopedia for a retina display iPad. So, theoretically, if Apple asked the company to demo at the iPad 3 launch, Fotopedia would be ready. ""But we havent gotten a phone call,"" Daligault says. Steve Jobs emphasized that the iPad isn't just a tool for consumption, like other mobile devices — it's a tool for creation. Apple has its own photo-creation tools it can debut or update as well — Photobooth for example. This app uses the iPad 2′s front-facing camera for taking self portraits with different visual effects, and it could receive an HD update. Nonetheless, to expand its current content-creation possibilities for tablets, Apple would need to introduce new products. Most likely, we think, would be a new iPad 3 version of iPhoto for more professional-caliber photo editing on the go. Running a display resolution of 2048 x 1536 — a higher resolution than that of the screen on the 15-inch MacBook Pro — would allow photographers to dive quite deep into onscreen details. The display would also be terrific for sharing slideshows. Video . When the iPad 2 launched, one of the major new apps Apple introduced was iMovie for iPad. iMovie lets you cut and edit video clips, use AirPlay to stream content to an Apple TV, and play video directly on the iPad itself. If the iPad 3 is getting a spiffy new HD display, and (just as likely) an improved camera capable of recording 1080p video — you know, to match the display — then an update to iMovie seems not just likely but inevitable. Like an iPhoto port for iPad, an update to iMovie would help solidify the iPad as a tool for creative types who don't want to be tethered to a desktop or keyboard-burdened notebook. Other video-centric apps could focus on sports, like the MLB.com app that was singled out at the original iPad's announcement. (Maybe we'll see MLB at Bat 2012.) And with Apple's AirPlay feature, we could see Apple demoing 1080p streaming video from the Apple TV to the iPad 3. Bottom line: If the new iPad does have a retina display, you can bet that action-packed, high-quality video will be a key part of the presentation. Games . At the iPhone 4S launch, Apple showed off Infinity Blade II, which featured souped-up graphics to take advantage of the phone's A5 processor and 3.5-inch retina display. The iPad 3 is very likely to sport either a dual-core or quad-core A6 processor. Either way, A6 performance will trump that of the iPad 2′s A5 chip, and paired with a high-resolution display, an immersive, action-packed game like Infinity Blade would be just the title to show what the new tablet is capable of. Now, it doesn't look like we'll be seeing an HD version of Infinity Blade at the iPad 3′s launch. Epic Games Representative Laura Mustard told us that the Infinity Blade team ""hasn't been talking to Apple about their plans for the future."" So what are some other possibilities? Gameloft's N.O.V.A. 2 HD is a graphics-intensive iPad game that integrates with Apple TV and iCloud. It originally came out in January 2011 and was updated in November. ""Gameloft is always keen to anticipate and support innovative features enabled by Apple,"" representative Jessica Lewinstein told us. N.O.V.A. 2 HD already has detailed graphics that would look even better on a higher-resolution display, not to mention a tablet with improved processor performance. At the iPad's original launch in 2010, CEO Steve Jobs focused on a 3-D version of the game Need for Speed, as well as other apps from Electronic Arts. Considering Apple and EA have teamed up before, it wouldn't be surprising to see an EA game onscreen in San Francisco in a month's time. Options could be anything from Mirror's Edge, whose sharp, high-flying action would make for an impressive spectacle, to maybe the iPad version of Battlefield 2. An iPad version of Battlefield 3 would probably be a bit too much wishful thinking, but you never know. Textbooks . Apple just updated iBooks and iTunes U, as well as ways to purchase and create digital textbooks, in its education-related announcement in January. It wouldn't be shocking to see the company iterate on these products one more time to make them HD ready. Display quality is currently an issue when reading textbooks on regular e-readers and current tablets. E-ink e-readers can't show off bold, color graphics (or any color at all), and even the iPad 2 doesn't have the display resolution to show off some educational content in all its glory. So being able to view and interact with images and diagrams in incredible detail on the iPad 3 would be an impressive addition to an already useful educational tool. Suddenly, processes like the Krebs Cycle wouldn't be so dry anymore, and you could actually attend your engineering lectures without lugging half a dozen different tomes in your backpack. Obviously, all of the app picks we mention above are purely speculative. But we would be surprised if Apple doesn't showcase some type of app for each of the categories we've called out.

"(CNN) -- Two more people in China have died from the H7N9 bird flu virus, raising the country's death toll to five, state-run news agency Xinhua reported Thursday, citing Shanghai health officials. H7N9 is a strain of avian flu not detected in humans before China's recent cases, which the country began reporting on Sunday. Fourteen human cases of H7N9 -- all in eastern China -- have now been reported, according to Xinhua. ""We don't know yet where the humans got their virus from,"" said Dr. Joseph Bresee, who heads the epidemiology and prevention branch in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's influenza division. The virus has not been shown to spread easily between humans, he added. The two most recent deaths happened Wednesday in Shanghai hospitals. All but one of the five deaths have occurred in that city. One of Wednesday's deaths was that of a 48-year-old poultry transporter who, although he died in Shanghai, lived in nearby Jiangsu province, Xinhua reported. The three previously reported deaths were: two men -- ages 27 and 87 -- who lived in Shanghai, and a 38-year-old man who lived in Zhejiang province but worked in Jiangsu province, according to state-run news agency Xinhua. The CDC is working closely with Chinese authorities trying to find the source of the human infections, Bresee said. ""There are lots of things happening at CDC to prepare for this virus,"" Bresee said. ""State health departments are readying themselves just in case,"" and researchers are working on developing a vaccine for this strain, he said.

"Washington (CNN) -- Describing the billions of dollars in contracts and services handled by the General Services Administration as a den of temptation, senators from both parties on Wednesday called for the agency at the center of a spending scandal to clean house as it roots out corruption. ""The party's over,"" declared Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer of California, chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, at one of four congressional hearing so far this week on the controversy that has embarrassed the Obama administration in an election year. Speaking to GSA Inspector General Brian Miller and Acting Administrator Dan Tangherlini, Boxer said the panel ""will support you and encourage you to clean house"" at the vast federal procurement agency. At the same time, Boxer emphasized that the GSA has a history of misconduct dating back decades under Republican and Democratic administrations, and that it was a person appointed by President Barack Obama who uncovered the latest wrongdoing involving an $800,000 work conference and other abuses. Mitt Romney on GSA and Secret Service controversies . Tangherlini and Miller also testified later Wednesday at a Senate appropriations subcommittee hearing where Chairman Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, wondered how the hundreds of GSA employees exposed to the excesses failed to question the obvious misconduct taking place. ""It's appalling that someone didn't say, 'Wait a minute. Isn't this going overboard?' "" Durbin said. Democrats sought to frame the controversy as an ongoing problem at GSA rather than anything unique to the Obama administration, and Republicans on the panel cited what they called a systematic failure resulting from a culture of misconduct at the agency. Ranking Republican Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma said of the GSA that ""if there's anyone who has a propensity to do something dishonest, that's where they ought to be"" because ""they deal with huge numbers."" ""I am concerned that this type of waste has become an embedded part of the culture at the GSA,"" Inhofe said, noting the wrongdoing occurred at a time of fiscal austerity, including calls by Obama to cut government waste. ""One can only wonder what kind of waste would have occurred in a better economy."" Boxer later used an extended closing statement to encourage Tangherlini to take substantive steps to solve the problems at GSA once and for all, no matter what it takes. ""There still are ugly things that are going to come out. Let's face it,"" Boxer said of continuing investigations by Miller. ""What is so outrageous about this is how these bad apples, very bad apples, perhaps criminal apples, have sullied the reputation of very good people,"" Boxer said, adding, ""don't underestimate this job you have in terms of shaking this tree and letting these bad apples fall."" Earlier this week, two Republican-led House committees held hearings examining the scandal, which became public last month with Miller's final report detailing a GSA conference in Las Vegas that cost more than $800,000, as well as violations of travel and spending rules. The revelations have prompted taxpayer indignation and put a spotlight on wasteful spending by the GSA, which handles government real estate and other nonmilitary procurement. Asked Wednesday about how to fix the problems at GSA, Miller called for more centralized control of the agency with more oversight to hold regional officials accountable for spending. Tangherlini said he already has been taking steps to improve central oversight as part of a review of the entire agency. That review is expected to take months. On Tuesday, House members questioned why Jeff Neely, the GSA staff member who organized the 2010 Las Vegas conference, took more trips on the federal dime after Miller's preliminary report last year showed spending and travel abuses. Neely was put on administrative leave in March, a month after Miller had submitted his final report. Neely declined to show up for Tuesday's session of the House Transportation Committee, claiming his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in the investigation. He also declined to testify at the House Oversight Committee's hearing Monday. On Wednesday, Boxer took a shot at the Monday hearing where Neely repeatedly claimed his Fifth Amendment rights. ""We're not looking for photo ops of people taking the Fifth,"" Boxer said. ""We're trying to move forward and make sure this doesn't happen again."" The controversy, which includes allegations of personal travel under the thin guise of government business and an employee award program that exceeded spending limits, so far has focused on one of 10 regions of the GSA -- an agency with a multibillion-dollar budget and more than 12,000 employees. Coming in an election year, the scandal has become a political focal point, with Republicans seeking to frame it as a reflection of big government abuse while Democrats say the problem involved a few bad players rather than a rotten system. During this week's hearings, past and present GSA officials have described the agency's complex management structure that proved unable to respond quickly to misconduct cited by the inspector general's report. For example, the chief financial officer lacked direct oversight of regional budgets. One exchange Tuesday between Rep. Jeff Denham, a freshman Republican from California, and Miller highlighted the ways that Neely, and presumably others, avoided strictures against supplying food at government work conferences such as the Las Vegas event by creating joke awards in order to hold ceremonies at which food would be allowed. ""To get around the administration's rule of not having food, they got around it by having an awards ceremony at every conference or every day of a conference?"" Denham asked. Miller responded: ""According to witnesses that we've interviewed, it was a running joke in Region 9 that in order to get food, you had to give out awards -- and many of these awards were silly awards."" ""One of our witnesses characterized them, I guess, as fake awards, jackass awards and things of that nature,"" Miller said. ""Now, getting back to the Western Region's conference -- they gave out awards for theatrical performances. We do not consider that a proper award. The award has to be for contributions to the work of the agency. "" Martha Johnson, the GSA administrator who resigned April 2 because of the scandal, said Tuesday that the Western Region conference at the heart of the problem had become a ""raucous, extravagant, arrogant, self-congratulatory event that ultimately belittled federal workers."" Among videos of the conference that have surfaced is one of David Foley, a deputy commissioner of the Public Buildings Service, an arm of the GSA, appearing to mock congressional oversight. In it, he gave a talent show award to an employee whose video featured a rap about spending too much and joking about avoiding investigation. Additional videos included one that seemed to make fun of Obama, as well as a fake red carpet ceremony with Neely boasting that his goal was to make the conference ""over the top."" Details also emerged of the employee incentive program, which violated limits on awards or gifts. Miller said Wednesday that ongoing investigations are looking at several regions of the GSA, and that his experience so far has found that each stone uncovered brought further revelations. He said that in the wake of the scandal, employees were coming forward to report other possible wrongdoing. ""Even today, we found out that the wife of the regional commissioner had a parking space throughout the entire year of 2012 at the federal building,"" Miller said. ""And we just find one thing after another."" Tangherlini, however, said there was no evidence so far of endemic misconduct throughout the GSA, noting he has encouraged agency workers to reach out to him with concerns. ""They have not been shy,"" Tangherlini said.","NEW: Inspector General Brian Miller says his office is finding more possible problems .

"(CNN) -- At first glance, Austrian artist Klaus Pichler's spell-binding photographs could be mistaken for a set of stylish advertisements. It takes a moment to digest -- excuse the pun -- that you're staring at pictures of rotting food. Among them, a pineapple hangs suspended in negative space above an antique gold dish -- its formerly yellow flesh having given way to luminous green mold; Deep purple beetroots sit snugly in an elegant porcelain vase with thin films of gray fur accumulating on their skin. The idea is simple: ""To expose the contradiction between the beauty of food products -- particularly as presented in the media -- and the ugly reality of overconsumption and waste,"" explained Pichler. The title of his new series -- ""One Third"" -- derives from a 2011 U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization report. It revealed a chilling statistic: A third of all food products worldwide go uneaten. Depending on the type of food in question, this figure ranges from between 25% and 75% and, altogether, it amounts to 1.3 billion tons of edible goods discarded each year. In a world where approximately 925 million people suffer chronic hunger, the overarching moral implications are stark. But the less documented environmental consequences are almost as alarming. According to a Greenpeace report, the food industry is responsible for creating up to 30% of the world's total annual carbon emissions. ""The dominant food production system is based on fossil fuel at every level,"" said Dr Martin Caraher, Professor of Food and Health Policy at London's City University. ""It needs oil to make the fertilizer, oil for the farm, oil for the food processing, oil for the packaging and oil to transport it to the shops."" Read related: Futuristic farm shop grows food in synthetic veg patch . But wasted food doesn't just entail all the embedded carbon released during production and transportation. It generates more emissions once it's discarded on the trash heap. ""A significant percentage of the household food that is wasted ends up in landfill, where it produces CO2 and methane gas,"" explained Richard Swannell, director of waste prevention at the UK-based Waste & Resources Action Programme (WRAP). ""Methane is 23 times more potent than CO2 as a greenhouse gas,"" he added. As such, WRAP calculates that every ton of food and drink wasted roughly equates to 3.8 tons of greenhouse gas emissions that could otherwise have been avoided. ""Applying this factor to the quantity of food waste in the UK, leads to an estimated 17 million tons of CO2 in 2010 -- the equivalent to the emissions of 1 in 5 cars on our roads,"" said Swannell. And yet a recent study revealed that up to 40% of food thrown away by consumers in Europe is still in its original packaging when it lands in the dustbin. This all begs the question: Why do we squander so much? Pichler says that the high-end, fashion magazine finish of his images reflect what he sees as the ""over-commoditization"" of food as a lifestyle accessory. ""With countless cookery shows and ever more seductive advertisements, food has become a major part of the culture industry,"" he said. ""This, along with the false economy of discount bulk buys, is part of why people are purchasing more than they can use. ""It's a peculiarly Western phenomenon,"" he added. Dr Ulf Sonesson is senior scientist in environmental systems at the Swedish Institute for Food and Biotechnology -- the body commissioned by the UNFAO to coordinate its food waste report. He agrees with Pichler that the problem is symptomatic of the West's culture of cheap disposable goods. His research found, perhaps unsurprisingly, that in Europe and North America, each consumer wastes between 95 and 115 kilograms of food a year, whilst only 6 to 11 kilograms of edible goods are discarded per person in Sub-Saharan Africa and South East Asia. These numbers don't reveal the full extent of the disparity. Sonesson notes that the majority of uneaten food in places like Sub-Saharan Africa is created at the point of production, largely as a consequence of things like spoiled crops or poor refrigeration. In contrast, supply-side practices have become more efficient in wealthy industrialized nations, according to Sonesson, but consumers have become much less diligent: ""We throw away more food than ever before,"" he said. Sonesson contends that the problem boils down to basic economic logic. He says that, despite some recent commodity fluctuations, the price of food in industrialized nations continues to drop, so there's less incentive to think about what's in the fridge, or make an effort to avoid cooking more than we need. ""As a result, today we have less knowledge about cooking and food preparation ... My parents and grandparents knew how to make use of everything,"" he said. What would it take to wind back the clock? Swannell thinks that it would only require a series of relatively small behavioral modifications: . ""For instance, just taking five minutes to go through your store cupboard and fridge before making a shopping list can stop you wasting money buying ingredients you may already have. ""Or, when you get home with your shopping, transfer as much as you can straight into the freezer. If you have large packets of chicken pieces or fish, divide them up and freeze individual portions ... there's loads of simple, easy things like this that you can do."" But it's not just consumers who are at fault. Pichler says that supermarkets are guilty of discarding large quantities of food for seemingly frivolous reasons. ""There's a tendency for supermarkets to put pressure on food producers to supply them with 'perfect' products. This pressure is to blame for the common practice of goods being discarded and destroyed immediately after harvest because of minor imperfections,"" he said. ""Furthermore, it's not unusual for supermarket chains to purposely acquire a surplus of food, so shelves can remain fully stocked with perishable items -- pastries, meat, fruit and vegetables -- right until closing time,"" he said. Farm in the city could be supermarket of the future . But the tides might be turning. Swannell points out that, although a long-time coming, people in some nations are finally waking up to the seriousness of the issue. He points out that in 2007, the UK wasted 8.3 million tons of food, but by 2010 that figure had dropped to 7.2 million. Only time will tell if the rest of the industrialized world will follow suit.","Austrian artist has created a series of images that challenge wasteful attitude to food .

"(CNN) -- Maria Cole, the widow of singer Nat ""King"" Cole and mother of singer Natalie Cole, died Tuesday after a short battle with cancer, her family said. She was 89. ""Our mom was in a class all by herself,"" her three children said in a statement Thursday. ""She epitomized, class, elegance, and truly defined what it is to be a real lady. We are so blessed and privileged to have inherited the legacy that she leaves behind along with our father. She died how she lived -- with great strength, courage and dignity, surrounded by her loving family."" Maria Cole, a jazz singer when she married Cole in 1948, was known for her strength as her husband's stardom rose and racial threats increased. ""There were refusals at hotels, there were places we'd go he wouldn't let me get out of the car because they would go in first to see if we could get the rooms,"" Maria Cole told CNN in an interview last year. ""He didn't want me embarrassed with him."" She dealt with hatred from her neighbors when her family bought a home in Hancock Park, then an exclusive all-white neighborhood next to Hollywood, California, soon after her 1948 marriage. ""There were no Jews or blacks there and they just almost had a stroke,"" she said. ""And I didn't care if they did."" Despite efforts to force the Cole family to move, ""We stayed there and we gave them tit for tat,"" she said. Her husband, though, ""was not an activist,"" she explained. ""He didn't have an antagonistic bone in his body,"" she said. ""He should have had a few, but my husband was not a fighter."" ""I loved him dearly, but we were exact opposites,"" she said. ""I admired him for his strength and his talent. He was very proud. He didn't say a lot. He was criticized by some of his own people because of it, you know."" Maria Cole was also at his side when Nat ""King"" Cole's groundbreaking television show, launched in 1957, folded after only a year because no national advertiser would risk a Southern boycott by sponsoring the first program hosted by an African-American. ""Madison Avenue is afraid of the dark,"" Cole said after quitting the show, making reference to the street in New York on which many advertising firms were located. Cole's widow reflected on that comment in last year's interview. ""Isn't that a wonderful line?"" Maria Cole said. ""Madison Avenue was afraid of the dark in so many ways. The fact that he was black, the fact that they just don't seem to know what's going on."" The show drew a who's who of Hollywood stars -- entertainers who wanted to make the first national show with an African-American host a success. ""Every one of them came on there saying, 'We'll do it, we'll show them,' "" she said. ""It was that feeling among all of them."" Maria Cole was partial to the shows with the Mills Brothers and Ella Fitzgerald, who she said was ""the greatest singer, as far as I'm concerned."" The failure to get a national sponsor left her husband ""very disappointed."" ""He really thought he could change things,"" Maria Cole said. ""He just really thought the show was going to change things."" After a year, Cole decided to quit, she said. ""It was hard for him, very hard,"" Cole's widow said. ""He said, 'No, I can't do it anymore. I won't do it.' "" In her last interview with CNN, in February 2011, the 46th anniversary of her husband's death, Maria Cole said she wanted fans to remember her husband for his talent. ""It was a very unusual talent,"" she said. ""I remember reading where Sammy Davis Jr. said 'We ain't likely ever to see another one like him.'

"(CNN) -- Saudi Crown Prince Nayef bin Abdulaziz, a hard-line conservative who is credited with pushing back al Qaeda, will be buried Sunday, a spokesman said. Nayef, who had been named crown prince in October by his brother the king, was heir to the Saudi throne. Saudi state TV, which reported his death Saturday, broadcast Quran readings as an expression of mourning for the prince, who died in Geneva, Switzerland. ""It is a shock. We all knew his health was frail but his death is a shock,"" Saudi Foreign Ministry spokesman Osama Nogali told CNN. ""We still don't know the reason behind his death."" The Saudi Press Agency published a statement from the Royal Court, saying it ""condoles the Saudi people on the deceased prince pray to God to bless his soul and to reward him for his services to his religion and homeland."" Nayef's body will arrive in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on Sunday and will be buried after afternoon prayer in Mecca, Nogali said. After the funeral, a period of mourning -- most likely for three days -- will be announced, a Saudi official told CNN. The official asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media. U.S. President Barack Obama released a statement Saturday offering his condolences. ""Under his leadership, the United States and Saudi Arabia developed a strong and effective partnership in the fight against terrorism, one that has saved countless American and Saudi lives,"" Obama said. He praised Nayef for supporting a broad partnership between Saudi Arabia and the United States. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden similarly offered his condolences, and hailed the former leader as an important ally in the fight against terror. It is expected that authorities selected by the king to choose a successor will meet as soon as the mourning period is over, the official said. A new crown prince could be named within the next three to four days, the source said. Nayef served as Saudi interior minister since 1975, having overseen the kingdom's counterterrorism efforts. He also served as deputy premier. A classified U.S. Embassy cable leaked by the website WikiLeaks described Nayef as a hard-line conservative who was lukewarm to King Abdullah's reform initiatives. Nayef led the crackdown against hard-line Islamists who took control of Mecca in 1979, and also oversaw the smashing of Saudi-based al Qaeda cells in the mid-2000s. In recent years, his son, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, has led the kingdom's fight against al Qaeda as the elder Nayef seemed to have taken more of a backseat. On Saturday, the Bahrain state-run news agency announced three days of mourning in that country and ordered flags to be lowered to half-staff there and at its embassies abroad. Kuwait also announced a three-day mourning period. Years after 9/11, Saudi Arabia slowly modernizing .

"Beijing (CNN) -- The diplomatic drama over Chen Guangcheng showed promising signs of a resolution Friday, with China indicating the activist could apply to travel to the United States and New York University announcing it has invited him to be a visiting scholar. China was incensed after Chen, who broke out of house arrest, sought refuge at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. He left the embassy after six days and went to a hospital, where he was reunited with his wife and their two children. Since then, he has made several pleas to be allowed to leave China, including a call to a U.S. congressional hearing. China's decision to allow Chen to travel abroad to study was seen as a significant sign of progress in what has been a thorny and controversial impasse. ""As a Chinese citizen, he may apply like other Chinese citizens according to the laws and normal procedures of the relevant departments,"" said Liu Weimin, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the United States was ""encouraged"" by Liu's statement. ""From the beginning, all of our efforts with Mr. Chen have been guided by his choices and our values, and I'm pleased that today our ambassador has spoken with him again, our embassy staff and our doctor had a chance to meet with him, and he confirms that he and his family now want to go to the United States so he can pursue his studies,"" she told reporters in Beijing. New York University said Friday it has invited Chen to be a visiting scholar, working with its law programs. Chen would be in New York or one of the university's global sites, the university said in a statement, adding that the blind activist, 40, has ""long-established relationships"" with faculty at the NYU School of Law. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland earlier said Chen had been offered a fellowship from an American university, where he could be accompanied by his wife and children. ""The Chinese government has indicated that it will accept Mr. Chen's applications for appropriate travel documents,"" Nuland said. ""The United States government expects that the Chinese government will expeditiously process his applications for these documents, and make accommodations for his current medical condition. The United States government would then give visa requests for him and his immediate family priority attention."" U.S. Ambassador to China Gary Locke, who spoke with Chen by phone for 20 minutes, said Chen told him he wants to travel to the United States for study, senior U.S. officials said. The U.S. officials said that as long as Chen has a legitimate offer from an accredited institution and is serious about studying in the United States, he would be given a student visa. ""We believe steps will play out expeditiously,"" one U.S. official said. The news that embassy staff had an opportunity to meet with Chen underscores the progress in the case. Chen had said early Friday that U.S. Embassy officials had told him Chinese security personnel stopped U.S. diplomats from entering his hospital room Thursday. He is in a Beijing hospital for treatment of a foot injury suffered during his escape. But the embassy staff and doctor met with Chen at the hospital for 45 minutes, the senior U.S. officials said. Friday was the 10th birthday of Chen's son, and embassy staff brought him presents. Clinton's long-planned visit to Beijing for strategic and economic talks became dominated by a flurry of negotiations between Chinese and U.S. officials over the Chen case. The diplomatic headache came just months before a presidential election in the United States and a once-in-a-decade change of leadership in China. The uproar prompted sharp Republican criticism of the Obama administration as soft on autocratic governments that abuse their citizens, and it has touched a nerve politically. In one remarkable development, Chen called into a congressional hearing Thursday chaired by Republican Rep. Chris Smith of New Jersey. ""China pledged to guarantee my constitutional rights and called me a free man,"" Chen said, speaking from his hospital room early Friday in Beijing to congressional commission members who listened by speakerphone in Washington, 12 times zones and thousands of miles away. ""I want them to keep their commitment by allowing me to travel abroad to recuperate,"" he said. ""I want to go to the United States and rest for a while, since I haven't had a Sunday in seven years."" The Chinese comments came as U.S. diplomats spoke with Chen in the hospital. The officials also met with Chen's wife, Yuan Weijing, according to a senior State Department official who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter. Clinton was due to leave China on Saturday for Bangladesh. It remains unclear whether a fresh deal over Chen's future will take shape before she departs. Chen, Bo rewriting China's script . Chen said he was worried about his relatives in his hometown in the eastern province of Shandong, which he fled last month. He said he has not been able to contact some of them and blamed local Chinese officials for his living situation there. ""They have installed seven surveillance cameras in my house,"" he said. ""In addition to have the guards stay in my place, they are building an electric fence around my house. They even scoffed, 'Let's see what this blind guy can do to us.' "" In a telephone interview with CNN, Chen expressed optimism that U.S. officials would act on his behalf. ""I believe they will help me,"" he said. Until last month, Chen had been forcibly confined to his home for 18 months after serving four years in prison, apparently over his legal advocacy for what he called victims of abusive practices such as forced abortions and sterilizations by China's family planning officials. When Chen left the embassy, U.S. officials announced that they had worked out a deal with China for his future and that Chen was leaving of his own free will. The officials said the Chinese government had committed to relocate Chen to a ""safe environment"" away from the province where he and his family say they had suffered brutal treatment by local authorities. In addition, the officials said, China agreed to investigate those allegations of mistreatment and promised Chen would face no further legal issues. Under the agreement, Chen was to be granted the opportunity to pursue university studies in the safe location. Locke said one of the proposals ""allowed for the possible transfer some day to an American college or university."" But Chen subsequently indicated he regretted having abandoned the embassy and made pleas through CNN and other international news organizations to U.S. leaders to get him out of China. His statements prompted bewildered reactions from U.S. officials, who reiterated that the decision to leave the embassy was Chen's and that he had repeatedly said he wished to remain in China. Did Obama betray a Chinese hero? On Friday, Chen mollified his tone compared with the comments he made a day earlier, when he said he was ""very disappointed"" in the U.S. government because he felt American officials had lobbied for him to leave the embassy and abandoned him at the hospital. Instead, he expressed ""deep gratitude"" to American officials in Beijing for having treated him ""extremely well"" during his six-day stay in the embassy. Jerome Cohen, an American law professor and friend of Chen, offered an explanation for Chen's statements after he left the embassy. ""Everything changed when he got to the hospital,"" said Cohen, who advised Chen by phone while he was inside the embassy. ""All of a sudden, the people who had worked so hard to secure his future from our embassy and our State Department, they were tired as can be and they went home to sleep."" Chen is ""in a very fragile emotional state,"" Cohen said. ""You have to understand the enormous pressures in which he's been living and recently operating. And it got to be too much."" Chen's case has touched a nerve in China. Comments from Chinese officials reported by state media have criticized what they call ""interference"" by Washington. Cohen said he is hopeful a deal can be reached to get Chen out of China. ""They're practical people,"" he said, referring to China's leaders. ""They're going to want to get rid of him and his family in the most humane appearance possible."" Human rights advocacy groups, meanwhile, questioned whether Beijing would stick to its promises about Chen's future, noting that several of his friends and family members have been detained or are unaccounted for. Visitors unwelcome in Chen's hometown . One of those friends -- the fellow activist who revealed Chen's dramatic escape to CNN last week -- reappeared Friday after being missing for a week. He Peirong had been unreachable since she told a U.S.-based human rights organization that the Chinese security services had arrived at her home. On Friday, she said by phone, ""I just got home and I'm doing OK."" She declined to comment further. ChinaAid, a Texas-based Christian human rights organization, said it remained concerned about Chen's relatives and other human rights figures in China. ""The fight for freedom and rights continues,"" said Bob Fu, ChinaAid's president ""Beijing gives Chen freedom with one hand and beats rights defenders with the other.""

"(CNN) -- William Ginsburg, an attorney who represented former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, died Monday at age 70, his family confirmed to CNN. Ginsburg died at home in Los Angeles from complications of cancer, his family said Wednesday. The attorney was known for being one of the first people to appear on all five major Sunday news talk shows on a single day during the Lewinsky scandal in the late 1990s, after the intern admitted to sexual activities with then-President Bill Clinton. Involved in the legal community for more than 45 years, Ginsburg also was involved in right-to-die cases in California and the dispute over the remains of musician Liberace, according to a statement his family released. He was passionate about constitutional law and frequently spoke to legal and medical associations, his family said. Ginsburg was a national board member and president and trustee of the American Board of Trial Advocates Foundation, which provides education concerning the history and value of the right to trial by jury, his family said. He was also active in several other groups and foundations.

"Washington (CNN) -- Lois Lerner, the head of the IRS unit handling tax-exempt status, invoked her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination before the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday. She is in the spotlight following a Treasury inspector general's report that found her unit used political criteria to screen applications for tax-exempt status from tea party and other conservative organizations. Lerner joins a long line of officials who ""took the Fifth"" when called to testify before Congress. Former Enron CEO Kenneth Lay, former lobbyist Jack Abramoff, retired Lt. Col. Oliver North and several Justice Department officials all invoked that privilege before Congress due to concerns that anything they may have said could have been used against them in court. Here is what the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution says: .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The parole hearing for one of killer Charles Manson's followers, Bruce Davis, was continued Wednesday to an undetermined date after Davis became sick, a corrections spokesman said. ""The hearing started but ended early because the inmate fell ill and had to leave for treatment,"" Jeffrey Callison, press secretary of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, told CNN. Two years ago, a California panel granted parole to Davis, but it was overturned by then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, officials said. Judge to ""Tex"" Watson: Police can have tape recordings . Davis, 69, is serving a life sentence for the 1969 first-degree murders of music teacher Gary Hinman and stuntman Donald ""Shorty"" Shea. In Davis' last parole hearing, in 2010, the board said that Davis had not been disciplined since 1980 and participated in all available education, vocation and self-help programs. Davis is one of several imprisoned followers of Manson, 77, who is serving a life sentence for nine murders. Manson led his ""family"" in a deadly spree in 1969, whose victims included eight-months-pregnant actress Sharon Tate. Manson was denied parole for the 12th time in March. Manson, whose gruesome killings inspired the best-selling book ""Helter Skelter,"" will be up for parole again 15 years from now, when he would be 92. Debra Tate, the sister of Sharon Tate, attended Wednesday's parole board hearing for Davis, but she told CNN that the hearing never started. The hearing was slated to start at 10:30 a.m. PT (1:30 p.m. ET), but Davis' defense attorney alerted the parole panel at 2:15 p.m. PT that Davis was ill, and the lawyer sought a postponement. ""Davis allegedly fainted for no apparent reason,"" Tate told CNN. ""Honestly, in my opinion, this was a ploy to help (Davis') defense attorney since he didn't want to deal with witnesses."" Tate said that if Davis and his defense team are planning to schedule a new hearing to avoid victim statements, ""that will happen over my cold, dead body,"" Tate said. Tate said she attends most parole hearing for imprisoned Manson ""family"" members. Wednesday's hearing was held at the California Men's Colony in San Luis Obispo, where Davis is incarcerated, 193 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles. ""The public needs to know this man is very dangerous now as he was in 1969,"" Tate told CNN before the hearing. She also attended Manson's parole hearing and objected to Manson's parole. CNN's Kelly Andersen contributed to this report.","Bruce Davis, 69, becomes ill, and his parole hearing is rescheduled .

"Adelaide, Australia (CNN) -- It is just a brief moment in time, the time it takes to draw a breath, to click your fingers, the time it takes to detonate a bomb. Life, as you knew it, changed forever. On the morning of July 7, 2005, I was just another anonymous commuter on my way to work during rush hour in London's crowded metropolis. I was short and spritely, weaving through what seemed like a never-ending sea of people to ensure I had a chance of getting on a Tube train. What I didn't know then was that a 19-year-old named Jermaine Lindsay, determined to detonate a bomb he was carrying in his backpack, was boarding the train carriage at the same time as me. We were just seconds out from the station platform when ""click"" -- no bang, no boom, no noise at all, just a split second between life and death, between light and complete darkness. Although we were all anonymous strangers in that carriage, in those crucial moments we became each other's saviors, a much-needed hand to hold, a comforting and reassuring voice to hear, we became united in our disbelief, our shock, our pain and our absolute horror. An hour passed before rescue could reach us, although the memory is one of timelessness -- the world had ceased to be, nothing made sense and my mind was trying desperately to process every aspect of what I was experiencing. I felt no physical pain, and yet as the thick darkness began to break, the light revealed it was only a thread of skin that was left attaching my legs to my body. It was the brutal images of those who had lost limbs from the Boston Marathon bombing being carried from the scene that resonated deep within my heart -- for I knew, I knew what life is without legs, I knew what they would face in the coming days, weeks, months and years. For me, it was the euphoria of survival, of having Life that ultimately saved me from feeling hatred, bitterness or indeed to seek revenge for my loss. I was Alive and I was still ""Gill"" and yes, although there was a significant part of my body missing, somehow my understanding of life grew. It was witnessing and indeed being a recipient of the brilliance of humanity that also shaped my ""new"" life -- and there was no better sign of this absolute brilliance than in my hospital wristband. It chillingly read ""One Unknown -- Estimated Female."" I remember vividly reading those words again and again and each time they revealed a deeper sense of humanity and what was important. That tag said to me that people actually put their own lives at risk in trying to save mine, trying to save as many as they could. To them, it didn't matter who I was, whether I had a religion, if I was rich or poor, if my skin was dark or fair, indeed if I was male or female -- all that mattered was that I was a precious human life. Being ""One Unknown"" also told me that on that morning Jermaine Lindsay didn't set out to kill or maim me, Gill Hicks. He didn't know me, he didn't know what I thought or what I felt: to him I was conveniently placed in a group called ""Them"" as opposed to ""Us."" I've often thought, what if we had the chance to talk before he detonated his bomb? I wasn't given a choice, I wasn't offered a chance to ""defend"" my life; instead he presumed that I was his enemy. Terror knows no names. Its list is broad and cruel, sweeping from Baghdad to Boston, killing and maiming those who have innocently been in detonation range. Humanity knows no names -- just the value of every single life. But must ""we"" forgive our hurt in order to heal? For me, the person whose actions took my legs is dead. He's gone. He is only a name to me. There is no chance for dialogue or for to say ""sorry,"" to even want my forgiveness. My healing is what I now understand to be a continuous journey, one where I must always find strength in love, of self and humanity and to stay focused on what really matters; leading a life that honors my great gift. Replacing the idea of recovery with a strategy for adjusting, adapting and ultimately accepting ""change"" has equally helped me to understand that I will never know what it is like to have my legs back -- to have that physical freedom again. I had to create a ""new"" idea of normal. To be filled with hatred, as those who created such devastation, was never an option. I allowed the brilliance of the unconditional love that I had experienced throughout my rescue and the following months and years to fill me and show me how to live. I knew that my life, this Life number 2 had to be dedicated to making a positive difference and to building a sustainable peace -- to endeavor to eradicate ignorance in the world, replacing it with empathy. While I wish the world would just ""Stop"" -- for there to be an end to innocent lives being killed or maimed by acts of terrorism or extreme conflict, I now realize, after years of deep thought, that all we can Change is ourselves. I hold onto the belief that If each of us, each ""One Unknown"" made a positive contribution to our own lives, that if we strived to grow to our full potential and truly honour the preciousness of being ""here"" -- then when multiplied, the acts of one become many and the acts of many can change the world as we know it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gill Hicks.","Gill Hicks says euphoria of survival saved her from feeling hatred for her loss .
Images of those injured in Boston bombings resonated with her, she says .

"Chicago (CNN) -- Maggie Daley, the wife of a former Chicago mayor, died Thursday night after battling breast cancer. She was 68. Daley died about 6 p.m. at home ""surrounded by family, including her husband, former Mayor Richard Daley, and her children, Nora, Patrick and Elizabeth,"" said Jacquelyn Heard, Daley's former spokeswoman and a family friend. ""The mayor and his family would like to thank the people of Chicago for the many kindnesses they've shown Mrs. Daley over the years, and they appreciate your prayers during this time,"" Heard said.

"(CNN) -- A federal bankruptcy judge in Texas on Wednesday rejected a request by imprisoned Charles Manson follower Charles D. ""Tex"" Watson not to turn over personal tape recordings to Los Angeles police. Police want decades-old recordings between Watson and his attorney because authorities believe the tapes might provide new clues about unsolved killings involving followers of Manson, according to court documents. Watson asked the judge to allow police to listen to all recordings in the presence of a court trustee or other designate but not take possession of them as the judge earlier ordered. The judge declined Watson's request to reconsider that order. Parole hearing for Manson follower postponed . ""To the extent Watson seeks a remedy regarding the LAPD's use of the recordings, or to prevent their release to the media, such matters are governed by nonbankruptcy law and can be addressed to a court of competent jurisdiction,"" Chief U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Brenda T. Rhoades wrote in her ruling. In the meantime, Los Angeles police plan to pick up the tapes on Friday, spokesman Cmdr. Andrew Smith told CNN. Photos: Charles Manson throughout the years . In a new letter to CNN, Watson asserted that ""there are no unsolved murders committed by the Manson Family."" The tapes are about eight hours of recordings between Watson and his attorney from 1969, Bill Boyd of McKinney, Texas, whose law firm is now a debtor in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the same state, court papers said. According to court documents, Watson waived his attorney-client privilege to the tapes in 1976, and his attorney received partial payment for his legal fees when he gave a copy of the tapes to Chaplain Raymond G. Hoekstra, who subsequently wrote a book, ""Will You Die for Me: The Man Who Killed for Charles Manson Tells His Own Story."" Watson wrote a June 5 letter to CNN: ""There is nothing new on the tapes that was excluded from my book 'Will You Die For Me?' The book was co-authored to show delicate consideration when sharing the graphic details of the crime in order to show respect towards the families of the victims."" Watson, Manson and three others -- Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel, and Leslie Van Houten -- were convicted of murder and other charges in a two-night rampage that left pregnant actress Sharon Tate and seven others dead, including Leno and Rosemary LaBianca. The enduring fascination of the Sharon Tate murder . The gruesome killings were chronicled in the best-seller ""Helter Skelter,"" and in Wednesday's court ruling, the judge notes that ""Watson expresses concern that the contents of the recordings may be hurtful to the families of his victims in the Tate-LaBianca murders."" In 2008, Watson wrote CNN that he was aware of no bodies buried in a remote Death Valley, California, site called Barker Ranch, the hideout for Manson and his family, when CNN did a report about a corpse-sniffing dog visiting the site. In court filings last week, Watson requested ""that the Tapes not be turned over to the LAPD, because they are not a creditor to my late attorney Bill Boyd, God rest his soul"" and ""because repercussions of the motion have not been fully considered by all parties concerned."" Added Watson in court documents: ""... this case is high notoriety, with much media attention. For this reason, special consideration should be made with who takes possession of The Tapes, so they will not be misused for purposes unintended by the court and that could be hurtful to the families of the victims."" Watson, 66, was convicted of seven counts of first-degree murder and was denied parole for the 16th time in November. He will be considered again in 2016, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Charles Manson denied parole, with next parole hearing set for 2027 .

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- For me, touring the SS United States felt kind of like I was exploring my grandmother's attic for the first time, not knowing what I'd find. The ship offers lots of room for surprises. It stretches the length of New York's Chrysler Building and is 100 feet longer than the Titanic. Its legendary decks were the site of untold stories, where movie stars rubbed shoulders with famous musicians and kings. And it's fast. On its first voyage, the SS United States set a trans-Atlantic speed record -- three days, 10 hours and 42 minutes -- a feat that has never been surpassed. The ship's late designer William Francis Gibbs constructed the vessel with fireproof materials, saying, ""You can't set her on fire, you can't sink her, and you can't catch her."" Now, six decades after its heyday, the vessel dubbed ""America's flagship"" is in need of a rescue. Expensive maintenance may force the owners to sell the historic ship for scrap metal, unless a solution can be found. During my tour through the dark and damp shell of former grandeur, the vastness of Gibbs' creation became even more evident. Gibbs, a naval architect responsible for nearly 5,500 Navy vessels that helped win World War II, put everything he had into his ultimate ship. The 2,200-passenger liner also was meant to double as a troop transport ship if war broke out. Gibbs' obsession with creating the perfect ocean liner has now transformed into his granddaughter's obsession with saving it. ""My grandfather was once asked who do you love more, this ship or my grandmother, and he said, 'the ship, a thousand percent,' "" said Susan Gibbs, executive director of the SS United States Conservancy. ""This is an extraordinary American achievement, an amazing expression of our post-war history, and it would be so tragic to see it destroyed."" Standing in the sunlight flooding the hefty enclosed promenade, Gibbs admits she never traveled aboard ""The Big U."" ""I didn't know my grandfather. He died when I was young,"" she said, gazing out the floor-to-ceiling windows. ""But I've gotten to know him through this ship. His spirit is here."" ""He felt this was the perfect ship and loved what she said about the nation. He saw the ship as a metaphor for the nation's post-war strength, pride and accomplishment."" Gibbs remembers traveling to Philadelphia from her home in Washington to see the SS United States for the first time. Along the way, she read her grandmother's diary out loud in the car. The journal revealed tales about the ship's maiden voyage and a joyful conga line celebrating the new speed record. It unveiled a bygone era when passengers donned mink stoles and enjoyed a liquor selection that included 49 kinds of scotch. Full of nostalgia, Gibbs snapped back to reality when the car edged closer to the dock. She gasped at her first sight of the weathered ship. ""When I walked on board, it was only a shadow of that,"" she said. ""I was saddened, but determined that we cannot let the ship go."" Walking through the ship's empty belly, I can feel that sadness too. Gone are the stately furnishings and decorations. All that remain of the cabins are outlines on the floor, accompanied by plugged toilet holes. It was hard not to feel like I was trespassing on property that was ransacked. Only this was no robbery -- the ship's interior fittings were auctioned off in the '80s. Despite the missing fittings, the SS United States remains nothing less than majestic. The longer I was on the ship, the easier it was to imagine it full of life. I could picture Marlon Brando chatting with artist Salvador Dali in the ballroom; hear Duke Ellington on stage tickling the ivories on one of the ship's fireproof pianos; or watch President John F. Kennedy and first lady Jacqueline Kennedy strolling on the decks. Dan McSweeney's father worked as a steward on the SS United States. Today, he oversees the liner's redevelopment project and is looking for partners to help save it. Out of service since 1969, the former reserve ship for the U.S. Navy has been docked in Philadelphia since the mid-1990s. The goal is to turn it into a stationary entertainment complex and museum. ""It's an irreplaceable part of American history, and once it's gone, it'll never come back, and we'll never have anything like it in the future,"" said McSweeney, managing director of the SS United States Redevelopment Project. ""It's not a vanity project. This is going to create jobs and be the crown jewel of a waterfront district."" ""If we lose it, we'll never get it back."" For now, the clock is ticking. Keeping the ship afloat costs nearly $80,000 a month for basic maintenance, insurance and security. The SS United States Conservancy launched a website where visitors can sponsor a piece of the ship for $1 per square inch. Gibbs says they have about two months before they'll have to sell the ship for scrap -- something she won't even allow herself to think about. ""Its name is the SS United States, and she's been here (in Philadelphia) for 17 years because she's not done yet,"" Gibbs said. ""We have to save her."" As Gibbs and I found our way off the ship, my shoes crackled against the crumbling, faded green surface of the outside deck -- like walking across an abandoned tennis court. We waved goodbye, and I wandered across the dock and turned around. Tilting my head back as far as I could, I stared up at her mighty bow. I couldn't help but notice the ship's towering sides were stained with streaks of rust -- the tears of a once proud iron lady.","Historic ocean liner SS United States is running out of money and may have to be scrapped .

"(CNN) -- California Gov. Jerry Brown is considering whether to grant parole to a convicted murderer who followed notorious killer Charles Manson, a spokeswoman for the governor said. Brown's office received a formal recommendation from the state board parole Friday to release Bruce Davis, 70, who would be the first Manson ""family"" member to secure freedom solely for good behavior. Brown has 30 days -- or until March 3 -- to either modify, affirm or reverse the parole board's recommendation, a corrections spokeswoman said. In 2010, Davis secured his first formal recommendation for parole by the state board, but then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger reversed the board's decision. Davis was sent to prison on April 21, 1972, for the 1969 first-degree murders of musician Gary Hinman and stuntman Donald ""Shorty"" Shea. Davis is serving a life sentence. Judge declines to reverse order giving Manson follower tapes to police . Michael Beckman, Davis' attorney, urged Brown to grant parole. If the case were not connected to Charles Manson, Davis would have already been released by now, Beckman said. He called it ""not fair."" ""He earned it,"" Beckman said. ""I think the governor should respect the work by his parole board. That hearing took five or six hours. They took into account everything about Bruce. And they didn't grant him parole as a favor. They didn't grant him parole on a whim. They considered it very carefully,"" Beckman said. Two men relate to same haunting specter -- Charles Manson .

"(CNN) -- Henry Linder did try to give up the shoe repair business once. It was 1991, and he was about to turn 72. He figured he was ready to stop fixing footwear and spend more time in the yard. That lasted about three months. Linder and his wife were on Social Security and needed a little extra income -- but mostly, he missed his customers. Now, at 93, this gentle craftsman with a thick Southern accent, a faded blue apron and a gift for gab is still charming customers in the shop behind his home in Landrum, South Carolina. Linder is a beloved fixture of Landrum, a town of 2,400 people in the Blue Ridge Mountains between Spartanburg, South Carolina, and Asheville, North Carolina. He has been featured in countless local newspaper stories and was the grand marshal of the town's 2008 Christmas parade. ""I make other people happy, or I think I do -- they say I do,"" Linder said in an interview with CNN this week. ""People want to know when I 'm going to quit, I say when my toes are turned up."" After learning about Linder years ago, a local filmmaker thought the cobbler deserved a little more recognition. He wasn't alone. Erik Olsen's 2012 short documentary about Linder, ""The Shoe Cobbler,"" won the Community Choice award in the 3rd Annual iReport Awards announced Tuesday. The three-minute film was picked by audience votes from among 36 nominees in six categories of audience storytelling. Seven winners, seven stories: Meet the 2013 iReport Awards recipients . ""This was a wonderful look of what America can be at its best,"" one viewer wrote. ""We need more Mr. Linders in our society."" Linder, who doesn't own a computer, is a little baffled by the attention. ""I guess people are just interested in me. I'm thankful for that,"" Linder said. ""I guess they think it's pretty fascinating to be an old man still fixing shoes."" When Olsen made the film, he said he felt he needed to share Linder's story before it was too late. ""The fact that he's still on his feet ... his attitude about people and business is just so uplifting,"" said Olsen, a former news photographer for a couple of ABC affiliates in North Carolina. He went into the shop one day, asked for an interview, and edited the piece that night. Linder was 17 when he first started repairing shoes during the Great Depression. Horseback riders make up much of his business, but over the years, he has given new life to all types of leather products, including children's baseball gloves, handbags and even a lady's corset (that was probably his oddest request, he says). Best of the Web? We think so . In the late '60s, he made a pair of shoes from scratch for a crippled child with clubfeet who walked on the sides of his feet. He used modeling clay to make molds of the child's feet and then chilled the molds in the refrigerator so he could stretch the leather over them. ""I can still remember the molds sitting in the fridge,"" said Linder's youngest son, Tim Linder. ""There weren't as many resources to help such children like there are today."" His customers know Linder as the guy who can ""renew the hopeless loafers and make your old favorite live again with a shine,"" said Tommy Lytle, a health care executive and longtime customer from nearby Tryon, South Carolina. He's had Linder fix several pairs of Weejuns and Cole Haan loafers and boat shoes. ""I always say 'Wow!' by reflex when I get mine back. You would too,"" Lytle said. But even if Linder had quit fixing shoes years ago, Lytle said, it would still be worth the trip into Linder's Shoe Service to see the owner grinning. A few other facts about Linder: He prefers apple cobbler to peach (with vanilla ice cream), and he really is as sweet as he seems, according to Tim. He himself owns five pairs of shoes, favoring those made by Bostonian and Allen Edmonds, which he says are ""about the best you can get."" The cobbler business isn't what it used to be. With shoes made more cheaply, most people would rather buy a new pair than pay $45 for a new set of heels and soles. That's one of the reasons Linder's son, who worked alongside him for a few years after high school, didn't follow him into the business. But horseback riders and other loyal customers give Linder a steady business, enough to keep the shop open three days a week. He also looks after an older son with disabilities. Both those endeavors helped keep him going after the death in 2001 of his wife, whom he cared for until she died, Tim said. Linder is hard of hearing now, and slower on his feet; but if you go into the shop, he still greets you with a cheerful smile, asks where you're from and tries to figure out if he knows your relatives. He's always loved to talk. ""I've made more friends than I've made money, I imagine,"" he told a reporter once. ""I've got the nicest customers in the world.""","South Carolina cobbler Henry Linder has been fixing shoes for 76 years .

"(CNN) -- Former Czech President Vaclav Havel, one of the leading anti-Communist dissidents of the 1970s and 1980s, has died at the age of 75, his spokeswoman announced Sunday. ""Vaclav Havel left us today,"" Sabina Tancevova said in a short statement on Havel's website. Havel, a puckish, absurdist playwright turned political activist, spent four and a half years in prison for opposing Czechslovakia's Communist government before emerging as a leader of the Velvet Revolution that swept it aside in 1989. He went on to become president of Czechoslovakia, and of the Czech Republic when the country split in two at the end of 1992. He died peacefully in his sleep Sunday morning in the presence of his wife, Dagmar, Tancevova said. Prague Castle, the office of the Czech president, is flying a black flag Sunday, Czech Television reported. World leaders react to death . The Czech government will meet in emergency session Monday to consider declaring a day of national mourning, the Czech News Agency reported. A deeply serious thinker given to long, rambling statements in presidential speeches and conversation, Havel also had an impish sense of humor, reportedly whizzing through the long corridors of Prague Castle on a scooter after becoming president. John Avlon: Vaclav Havel, a hero for today . It was his love of rock and roll as much as his moral outrage at the Communist system that brought him to prominence. He co-wrote the influential Charter 77 anti-Communist declaration in protest at the arrest of a Czechoslovak rock band, the Plastic People of the Universe. A perennial contender for the Nobel Peace Prize, Havel never won, but remained active in anti-Communist causes from Cuba to China until his death. Transcript: Havel talks to CNN in March about unrest in the Arab world . He urged Chinese authorities to release dissident Liu Xiaobo, whose Charter 08 call for greater political freedom in China was inspired by Czechoslovakia's Charter 77. Havel and other Czech dissidents attempted to deliver a letter to the Chinese Embassy in January 2010, before Liu won the Nobel Peace Prize, but found the doors closed and no one to receive it. It was an absurd scene that could have come out of one of the plays he wrote in the 1960s, poking fun at the Soviet-backed authorities who ruled his country at the time. Theater proved a potent weapon against Czechoslovakia's Communist rulers, who stepped down without a shot being fired in the weeks after the Berlin Wall fell, signaling the defeat of the region's authoritarian Moscow-backed regimes. Havel was unanimously elected president by the last Communist-run parliament of Czechoslovakia 22 years ago this month, and two months later delivered a speech to a historic joint session of the U.S. Congress. The trip to Washington as president of his country came less than four months after Havel was last arrested by the Communist authorities, leading him to tell Congress dryly: ""It is all very extraordinary indeed."" His country joined NATO and the European Union under his stewardship, but he lost out on many of the major domestic political battles of his presidency, including his effort to keep Czechoslovakia together. He resigned as president of Czechoslovakia after national politicians agreed to divide it in two, declaring, ""I will not be president of a self-liquidating nation."" He went on to be elected president of the Czech Republic twice before writing one final play, ""Leaving,"" about a politician preparing to hand over power to a successor he despises -- widely considered one last dig at his perennial political opponent Vaclav Klaus, his successor as president. Klaus Sunday called Havel a ""symbol of our renewed nation."" Havel's former spokesman, Ladislav Spacek, declared that Sunday was ""a cruel day,"" but recalled that when Havel had an operation to remove part of a cancerous lung in 1996, doctors gave him only a few years to live. Havel lived another 15 years, Spacek observed, saying people should be grateful for having had him as long as they did. Havel spoke to CNN's Jim Clancy in March, reflecting on links between the Arab Spring and the fall of Communism in eastern Europe. ""What is also sleeping under the surface and is invisible is a longing for certain elementary freedoms and that doesn't usually break out just like that, by itself,"" Havel said. ""The snowball is created, it's rolling and rolling and, very often, it turns into an avalanche."" British Foreign Secretary William Hague called him a ""Cold War hero"" who ""opened the door to democracy in Eastern Europe and will always be remembered."" ""Like millions around the world, I was inspired by his words and leadership. ... Vaclav Havel was a friend to America and to all who strive for freedom and dignity, and his words will echo through the ages,"" U.S. President Barack Obama said in a statement. Former U.S. President George W. Bush described Havel as a ""dignified, charming, humble, determined man"" who ""suffered much in the cause of freedom and became one of its greatest heroes."" But in his typically understated way, Havel expressed more modest wishes for how history would remember him. ""I would be glad if it was felt that I have done something generally useful,"" he said. ""I don't care much about personal fame or popularity. I would be satisfied with the feeling that I had a chance to help with something in general, something good.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Boston Marathon bombing was an all-too-familiar tragedy for Israeli medic Eli Beer. In his line of work, he's seen hundreds of similar attacks. ""I wish I could have been there to help,"" says Beer, adding he happened to be in the area finishing up coursework at Harvard and had taken a walk down Boylston Street just the day before the incident. Beer is founder of United Hatzalah, an all-volunteer rescue service in Israel, where emergencies are a way of life. Friday in Washington, he powered onstage -- sirens blaring -- aboard one of his signature ""ambu-cycles"" (an emergency-adapted motorcycle), stunning his audience at the Kennedy Center. A featured speaker at TEDMED -- the annual conference that brings together medical professionals, scientists, researchers, educators, artists and athletes -- Beer's talk carried the provocative title: ""How can we save 40,000 lives in under three minutes?"" He answered the question this way, ""The average response time of a traditional ambulance is 12 to 15 minutes -- we reduce it to less than three minutes. Our response is the fastest in the world. We call our approach a lifesaving flash mob. On motorcycles, traffic doesn't stop us. Nothing does."" When seconds count . ""Last year, United Hatzalah (Hebrew for 'rescue') treated 207,000 people -- more than 42,000 of them in life-threatening conditions,"" says Beer. ""We got there in under three minutes and made a huge difference."" He leads a team of 2,000 skilled volunteers -- EMTs who range professionally from ""expensive lawyers to people who sell fish or shoes,"" he says. Boston Marathon bombing heroes: Running to help . They make record time in a fleet of small cars, ambu-cycles, ambu-tractors and ambu-boats -- all equipped with heart defibrillators, breathing tubes, burn wraps and maternity kits. Usually, they get there first, treating and stabilizing patients until ambulances arrive for transport. Each volunteer handles an average of 60 calls a month. The service operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. Beer's innovative work stems from his own dreadful experience as a child. He was 6 years old when a terrorist bomb blew apart a Jerusalem bus passing right in front of him. Shocked, fearful and helpless, he fled the fiery scene where six people died and scores were injured. But he would not forget. ""That day began a simple dream -- the dream of being able to save people from dying waiting for an ambulance,"" reflects Beer. As a teen, he bought two police scanners, then dropped out of high school to become a paramedic. In 1989, he built the operation from the ground up, bucking bureaucracy, legal tangles and resistance from unions and existing emergency services. ""This started with chutzpah. I was going to find a way around it. I didn't wait for authorization and stickers,"" says Beer. ""We go, we don't charge and we don't require patients to have insurance. We don't ask questions about ethnicity or religion -- it's not about saving Jews or Muslims, it's about saving people."" United Hatzalah responders use a specially designed, state-of-the-art GPS system called NowForce. ""We are all connected with an app on our smartphones,"" says Beer. As calls come in, traffic-control navigators alert the first five responders closest to the scene. There are times volunteers tear out of their homes in the middle of the night and arrive onsite still wearing pajamas. ""At first, huge monopolies saw us as hurting their business. What's evolved is that they've actually reduced prices because of us. Their service got better because of us,"" says Beer. ""Now, we work closely with more than 100 ambulance companies in Israel. They know we are there for them. We don't replace ambulances -- we fill a gap. We send our people out to the scene. Whenever the ambulances arrive, that's fine. If there's a patient we can save, we will be there to save them."" There is no shortage of volunteers. In fact, there is a waiting list to sign up for the organization's 300-hour training course. First responder's emotional story . ""Our volunteers are Jews and non-Jews, Muslims and Christians -- we help one another by saving lives,"" says Beer. He believes the reward of giving back is greater than any other form of payment. ""Judaism teaches when you save someone's life, you're actually saving the world, because you just saved the whole world for this one person and the generation to come. People want the satisfaction of being part of this -- and they sacrifice a lot to do that,"" he says. Now 39 and the father of five, Beer recalls the first time he saved a life. At age 16, he treated a seriously injured man who had been struck by a car. The next day, he got a thank-you call from the man's son. ""Best call I ever got in my life,"" says Beer. Growing globally . His life-saving ingenuity is gaining recognition. United Hatzalah has operations in Brazil and Panama -- and plans to set up next year in India. ""This is something that is easy to adopt. Anywhere I can go and share, I want to be there,"" he says. Beer notes that the Hasidic Jewish community in New York has used the same technique (traveling on emergency bikes or cycles) for decades, successfully exporting the idea to other countries as well. The bombing this week in Boston reinforces what Beer learned the day he saw that first bus bombing as a boy -- every precious second counts. ""We are fighting for each second to get there. Seconds make the difference between life and death,"" Beer says. ""A lifesaving flash mob sounds to me like the world's next, greatest medical innovation,"" TEDMED curator Jay Walker said after Beer's talk. The next goal for United Hatzalah, which operates entirely on donations, is to cut response time in half. ""How can we save 40,000 lives in just 90 seconds? We all want to be heroes,"" says Beer. ""We just need a few good ideas and a lot of chutzpah.""","Eli Beer founded an all-volunteer rescue service in Israel .

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Marshals Service lost track of two former participants in the federal Witness Security Program ""identified as known or suspected terrorists,"" according to the public summary of an interim Justice Department Inspector General's report obtained by CNN. The Marshals Service has concluded that ""one individual was and the other individual was believed to be residing outside of the United States,"" according to the summary. A Justice Department official said in response to follow up questions about the matter by reporters on Thursday that the pair had left the program years ago and had been accounted for. It was not clear when or for how long the Marshals Service lost track of them. The report notes that while in the middle of an audit of the witness program, the inspector general notified the Justice Department of national security vulnerabilities. The agency watchdog ""developed the interim report to help ensure that the Justice Department promptly and sufficiently addressed the deficiencies we found."" After its audit, the inspector general's office reported that ""the department did not definitively know how many known or suspected terrorists were admitted"" into the witness program,"" among other ""significant issues concerning national security."" As of March 2013, the Justice Department was reviewing more than 18,000 program case files to determine whether more known or suspected terrorists have been admitted, the summary notes. As such, the number of terrorists lost or unaccounted for ""may not be complete and may continue to evolve."" The summary said that although the Marshals Service was giving known or suspected terrorists who participated in the witness program and their dependents new names and identity documents, the Justice Department ""was not authorizing the disclosure to a federal center that operates a terrorist watch list that helps provide information to the Transportation Security Administration's ""no-fly"" database. ""Therefore it was possible for known or suspected terrorists to fly on commercial airplanes in or over the United States and evade one of the government's primary means of identifying and tracking terrorists' movements and actions,"" the summary said. The inspector general's office notified the Justice Department of the problems and in the middle of remedying them, the Marshals Service discovered it could not account for the two missing people. A Justice Department official who spoke to reporters about the matter said on Thursday that the agency knows the whereabouts of witness program participants. ""As for the two people you're talking about, we know they left the country years ago, they left the program years ago, they have been accounted for. There has been no information provided that they have ever returned to the United States,"" according to the official who spoke . The Justice Department said in an earlier statement that the FBI had ""not identified a national security threat tied to the participation of terrorism-linked witnesses."" A Justice Department official also told CNN that the pair ""completed their obligations to the U.S. government by cooperating against terrorists"" and were not fugitives. The official added that ""for obvious reasons, we cannot comment on the exact location of any current or former participant"" in the program. The development broke in the midst of a difficult week for the Obama administration, with revelations that the Justice Department secretly collected months of phone records for reporters and editors at The Associated Press; renewed criticism and accusations of a cover-up over the White House's response to the deadly attack on the U.S. mission in Libya, and revelations that the Internal Revenue Service targeted conservative groups applying for tax-exempt status. President Barack Obama did not respond when asked at the White House on Thursday about the inspector general's report.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Whitney Houston died from an accidental drowning in a hotel bathtub, but the ""effects of atherosclerotic heart disease and cocaine use"" were contributing factors in her death, the Los Angeles County coroner said in an initial autopsy report released Thursday. Houston, 48, was ""found submerged in bathtub filled with water"" and ""no trauma or foul play is suspected,"" the coroner said in a one-page release. Her cocaine use appeared to have occurred ""in the time period just immediately prior to her collapse in the bathtub at the hotel,"" Chief Coroner Craig Harvey told reporters. The 60% narrowing of her arteries ""suggest a cardiac event complicated by the cocaine use"" led to Houston's slipping underwater, Harvey said. ""Something happened that caused her to go down and we know that when she slipped under the water she was still alive,"" he said. ""We have evidence of drowning since there was water in the lungs."" The toxicology tests found other drugs in her body, including marijuana, the anti-anxiety drug Xanax, the muscle relaxant Flexeril and the allergy medicine Benadryl, the report said. But these drugs ""did not contribute to the death,"" it said. The report released Thursday did not disclose the levels of each drug, but that information will be included in the final coroner report to be made public within two weeks, the coroner said. Houston's family, which had been informed of the findings before Thursday's release, issued a statement through a family spokeswoman. ""We are saddened to learn of the toxicology results, although we are glad to now have closure,"" said Patricia Houston, the singer's sister-in-law and former manager. Houston died February 11 in her room at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, California, the day before the music industry gathered for the annual Grammy Awards in Los Angeles. Authorities had said that police and fire officials were called to Houston's room at the Beverly Hilton after her unconscious body was found in the bathtub, just hours before she was to attend a pre-Grammy party at the hotel. Houston won six Grammys and sold 170 million albums, singles and videos over her career. In recent years, the singer's accomplishments were overtaken by her struggles with drug addiction. CNN's Jack Hannah and Kareen Wynter contributed to this report.","Houston used cocaine just before collapse in the bathtub, coroner says .

"New York (CNN) -- The heir to the Saudi throne, Crown Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, died in a New York hospital early Saturday, officials said, raising succession questions in the key oil-producing country at a time of regional turmoil. Sultan, the half-brother of King Abdullah, was thought to be in his 80s. He had been ill for some time -- various reports indicated that he was battling cancer -- and was receiving treatment in New York. Saudi television broke into normal programming early Saturday to announce the death. It broadcast Quranic verses and footage of pilgrims in the holy city of Mecca. Sultan's body will be flown back to Saudi Arabia and a burial is scheduled for Tuesday. He had served for decades as the Saudi defense minister. President Barack Obama called him a ""valued friend"" of the United States. ""He was a strong supporter of the deep and enduring partnership between our two countries,"" Obama said. ""On behalf of the American people, I extend my deepest condolences to King Abdullah, the royal family, and the people of Saudi Arabia. Robert Jordan, a former U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia, called Sultan a ""staunch ally."" ""His passing marks the end of a significant era in Saudi Arabia,"" he said. ""The steps taken to select a new Crown Prince will be scrutinized by the world and will provide insight into King Abdullah's vision for future leadership of the Kingdom."" Ascension to the Saudi throne does not pass from father to son. Rather, it's a complex process and decisions are always cloaked in secrecy in the conservative kingdom. King Abdullah set up the Allegiance Council in 2006 to allow for more transparency in succession. It is unclear when this group, made up of members of the royal family, will be employed to make a decision on the next crown prince. Sultan's death leaves his brother Nayef, a reputed conservative, as the likely successor to the king. Abdullah appointed Nayef in 2009 as the country's second deputy prime minister, a post held by the second in line to the throne. Nayef has been the interior minister since 1975 and as such, he oversaw the kingdom's counterterrorism efforts. Saudi Arabia is one of the only countries that has truly dismantled a domestic al Qaeda network, said Christopher Boucek, a Saudi expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""Nayef is widely seen as a hard-line conservative who at best is lukewarm to King Abdullah's reform initiatives,"" said a classified U.S. Embassy cable leaked by the website WikiLeaks. ""However, it would be more accurate to describe him as a conservative pragmatist convinced that security and stability are imperative to preserve Al-Saud rule and ensure prosperity for Saudi citizens,"" the cable said. But Boucek said little has changed. ""The king is still in charge, and nothing will change until the throne passes from him to the next brother."" Gregory Gause, a University of Vermont professor who has authored books on the Gulf states, said Nayef is hardly one to blaze a path for political reform, but that's not to say Saudi Arabia will feel any reverberations. ""There is truth to the idea that Nayef is not someone who sees political reform as a major goal of the government,"" Gause said. ""But I do not want to say that if he were to become king, he would act in the same way as he is now."" Saudi Arabia is not immune to the sort of popular uprisings that have brought down regimes in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya. The nation suffers from the same political and economic issues, Gause said. But the difference, he said, is that Saudi Arabia is wealthy and the king has recently deployed huge amounts of money for housing and salaries. Also Saturday, Abdullah left a hospital in Riyadh following successful back surgery, the Saudi Press Agency reported. Abdullah, 87, will complete his recuperation at the royal palace. It was the monarch's third back surgery in the past year. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia's leadership mourned Abdullah's half-brother. ""Crown Prince Sultan lived his life in service of his country and also serving the Arab people and the people of Saudi Arabia,"" said Saleh Al-Namla, a member of Saudi Arabia's Shura Council. ""He was very much loved by the country."" He took a leading role in Saudi Arabia's involvement in the 1991 Gulf War against Iraq, heading a coalition of about half a million troops from more than 30 countries. Of his many children, perhaps the best known internationally is Prince Bandar, Saudi Arabia's former ambassador to the United States. Bandar served as ambassador from 1983 to 2005 and was friends with the family of former President George W. Bush. CNN's Jamie Crawford, Mohammed Jamjoom, Moni Basu, Nic Robertson and Rima Maktabi contributed to this report.","King Abdullah leaves Riyadh hospital after back surgery .

"(CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry outlined Sunday a $4 billion economic development plan for the West Bank that he hopes will help encourage peace in the region. Details were scant on the proposal, which he announced in Jordan during a meeting of the World Economic Forum. ""The fact is that we are looking to mobilize some $4 billion of investment,"" Kerry said. A team is looking at opportunities in tourism, construction, energy and agriculture, among other industries, and will make recommendations to the Palestinians, he added. Experts believe the plan could increase the Palestinian GDP by as much s 50% over three years and cut unemployment to 8% from 21%, Kerry said. The initiative is supported by both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. ""Now, is this fantasy? I don't think so, because there are already great examples of investment and entrepreneurship that are working in the West Bank,"" Kerry told the crowd, which included Abbas and Israeli President Shimon Peres. ""So we know it can be done, but we've never experienced the kind of concentrated effort that this group is talking about bringing to the table."" He did not mention the names of any companies involved in the proposal, nor was it clear when and exactly on what the money would be spent. Kerry has made the Israeli-Palestinian issue the centerpiece of his tenure as America's top diplomat. He has spent more time on this issue than any other, is in almost daily contact with Netanyahu and speaks with Abbas several times a week. ""Negotiations can't succeed if you don't negotiate,"" he said Sunday. ""We are reaching a critical point where tough decisions have to be made. And I just ask all of you to keep your eyes focused on what can really be done here. Think of all that can change.""

"(CNN) -- A 37-year-old man arrested Wednesday in Washington state as part of an investigation of ricin-laced letters threatened in one such letter to injure and kill a federal judge, a grand jury indictment alleges. FBI agents arrested Matthew Ryan Buquet on Wednesday afternoon, and he made his initial court appearance in Spokane later in the day, the federal agency's Washington state office said in a news release. Buquet remained in custody after the appearance, and he'll stay behind bars at least until a bail hearing takes place next Tuesday afternoon, FBI spokeswoman Ayn Dietrich said. A grand jury charged Buquet with mailing threatening communication, claiming he ""knowingly and willfully"" mailed through the U.S. Postal Service a letter ""containing a threat to injure and kill Judge (Fred) Van Sickle,"" according to the indictment. Van Sickle is a senior judge in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Washington. In a subsequent news release, the FBI said tests -- conducted by that agency and the Spokane Regional Health District -- showed that a suspicious substance found with the letter was ""active ricin toxin."" ""Our coordinated team acted swiftly to resolve a potentially dangerous situation, and continues working tirelessly around the clock to investigate the origin of the letters and to address any remaining, potential risks,"" said Laura Laughlin, the FBI's special-agent-in-charge at the bureau's Seattle office. The U.S. Postal Inspection Service has been trying to find the source of the two letters containing ricin since they were intercepted in a screening procedure at a postal facility in Spokane, the FBI said last week. The American Postal Workers Union earlier did say a ricin-laced letter was sent to a judge in Spokane, the northeastern Washington city in which Van Sickle works. Another letter reportedly containing the toxin was directed to the Spokane Post Office, the union said. Both letters were postmarked May 14. Postal Service management told employees they weren't at risk from handling the letters because the suspected substance was not in a form that could be inhaled or readily ingested, the union said. That said, preliminary lab tests did indicate it was indeed ricin. If inhaled, injected or ingested, less than a pinpoint of ricin can kill a person within 36 to 48 hours because of the failure of the respiratory and circulatory systems. There is no known antidote for the toxin, which is derived from castor beans. CNN's Amanda Watts contributed to this report.","NEW: Matthew Buquet will stay in custody until at least next Tuesday, FBI says .

"(EW.com) -- In ""Gravity,"" George Clooney plays a veteran astronaut who looks amusingly like Buzz Lightyear, and Sandra Bullock is a medical engineer who is taking her first voyage into space and is having a hard time keeping her lunch down. They float around in the inky silent darkness, bobbing and gliding, with Earth spread out beneath them like a giant luminescent screensaver. Even when tethered to a spacecraft, the two are really out there, exhilaratingly and terrifyingly free. The miracle of the movie is the way that director Alfonso Cuarón, using special effects and 3-D with a nearly poetic simplicity and command, places the audience right up there in space along with them. Gravity is an awesome technological daydream of a movie, one that might be classified as science fiction, except that it isn't a futuristic fantasy. It's a tale of disaster and grief and survival rooted in the possibilities of space travel as they exist today. Part of what makes the film so thrilling is that it gives its characters no easy outs. The famous 10-minute tracking shot in Cuarón's ""Children of Men"" was a bravura act of staging, yet watching it, you could tell that it was thought-out and choreographed. In Gravity, though, the director works in such an ingeniously flowing and sustained way that his images all but transcend the essential visual grammar of ''the shot.'' The camera glides through space, twirling and doubling back, following the characters through pod doors and into the cramped interiors of satellites and then out again, giving the entire movie the spontaneous feel of a single unbroken shot — a free-floating galactic reverie. Sandra Bullock keeps defying 'Gravity' with her career . At the beginning we hear radio burbles of talk between the astronauts and Houston, and then, almost imperceptibly, a spacecraft drifts into view from the right side of the screen — it's a U.S. shuttle, and the astronauts are walking outside of it, attempting to repair a problem on the ship. You'll surely be reminded of ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" because what Cuarón echoes from Kubrick's great film — and what still seems eerily surreal in an outer-space movie — is the creeping rhythm of space, the weightlessness that places everything in a trance, turning the action into moment-to-moment semi-slow motion, a feeling of life suspended. Simply as an out-of-this-world, zero-friction ''ride,'' ""Gravity"" is unforgettable, yet the real essence of Cuarón's achievement is that the film's technical virtuosity and its emotional grip become one. Clooney's Matt Kowalski and Bullock's Ryan Stone are on a routine mission, but then there's a bulletin from Houston. A Russian satellite has exploded, causing a chain reaction. A shower of debris is about to come flying right at them, so they must abort the mission. It's too late, though: The debris hits them, full force (the 3-D places us right in the hurtling metal thick of it), tearing the ship apart. Seconds later, there is no ship. They are lost in space. What Buzz Aldrin thinks of 'Gravity' The ebb and flow of ""Gravity's"" story is deeply organic — it seems to be making itself up as it goes along, and that's how it hooks us. Yet what sustains our absorption is a rather tricky synthesis between our involvement in the characters' plight and our head-scratching wonder at the matter-of-fact way that the film brings the physical realities of space to life: the sheer cosmic terror of it, the images of satellites cluttered with drifting matter, from chess rooks to tears. The actors are phenomenal. Clooney shows a haunting chivalry beneath his bluster, and Bullock is as desperate and resourceful and anxious and brave as Sigourney Weaver in the last half of Alien. When Stone wriggles, slowly, out of her space suit, we realize that we're seeing a tale of rebirth, and Bullock's acting attains a new purity. She floats through this movie yet grounds it, letting ""Gravity"" connect with all of us these days who feel just a little adrift. Grade: A .

"(CNN) -- Almost every American ally in the Middle East is desperately calling out for help, and we are ignoring them. Turkey, Israel, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain -- and behind closed doors, even Egypt -- want American involvement in Syria to stop the blood bath. But the twin ghosts of Iraq and Afghanistan seem to have paralyzed America in the Arab world. On Thursday, Turkey's prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, will visit President Barack Obama in Washington. This is an ideal opportunity to throw American weight behind greater Turkish leadership in resolving the Syrian conflict -- and declare as much from the White House. The conflict is spreading fast outside of Syria, and unless regional powers such as Turkey, Israel and Saudi Arabia are empowered to act militarily, and swiftly, many more lives will be lost and the Middle East further destabilized. Only this weekend, Bashar al-Assad's intelligence agencies were linked to two car bombings in Hatay, Turkey, that killed more than 50 people and injured more than 100. Syria is now home to radical Sunni Islamists from across the globe who want to bring down al-Assad, and Shiite fighters from Hezbollah who support the Syrian president. Beyond geopolitics and games of nation states, Syria is a raw human disaster: Some 80,000 people have been killed, 1 million refugees have fled to neighboring countries, and millions more are displaced inside Syria. For how much longer will we stand by and watch? I oppose direct U.S. military intervention in Syria, but recent actions by Israel, daring attacks on Turkey and last month's rapprochement between these two important nations means that there is now new scope for greater regional involvement in Syria. Secretary of State John Kerry is right to pursue a new diplomatic settlement through Moscow, but his hand is only as strong as the force gathering on al-Assad's doorsteps. In other words, let us say yes to diplomacy, but not be naÃ¯ve and think that al-Assad and his Iranian backers cannot outmaneuver the wiliest diplomats. They have rebuffed at least five other such attempts. Diplomacy must be backed by force. Al-Assad understands the language of military strength -- of armies keeping fighting factions apart, aircrafts enforcing a ""no-fly"" zone, bombs on his runways, tanks outside his presidential palace, ships on the seas. That is not to say that the killings continue. Erdogan has been sensitive when dealing with PKK terrorists in not killing them for fear of collateral damage. That same spirit of protecting human lives must inform Turkish leadership in Syria. First, al-Assad and his family need to leave Syria for Russia, Iran or elsewhere. Their days of ruling like a mafia are over. Large segments of the Syrian people have lost their fear of al-Assad, and will not settle for anything less than his departure. He must either do so freely and immediately, or meet the fate of Moammar Gadhafi and Saddam Hussein. Second, al-Assad is not the protector of Syria's minorities, as many mistakenly believe. He is the cause of mass killings that are likely to get worse without external intervention. Genocide of Syria's minorities will have a ripple effect on tribes and religious minorities in Iraq, Lebanon and Jordan. Turkey and regional and NATO forces should make it their utmost priority to prevent it. Third, with all their divisions and sectarian pettiness, it is the Syrian opposition that must own Syria. Colin Powell's admonition that ""If you break it, you own it"" cannot be applied to outside countries with Syria -- the owners must be the Syrian opposition (with all its flaws), not Turkey, far less Israel or Saudi Arabia or others who ""break"" al-Assad's grip. Fourth, removing al-Assad and safeguarding Syrian communities is not the end, but a new beginning. Syria can go in any number of directions. The challenge from Islamist radicalism and terrorism inside Syria is real -- they can be confronted there, and prevented from traveling elsewhere and spreading their virus of violence. As Syria works toward rebuilding its infrastructure, economy, society and polity, the United States cannot turn its back on a country that shares borders with Jordan, Turkey, Iraq, Israel and Lebanon. For now, Washington needs to respond to the calls of our allies in the Middle East, and in doing so, bring Turks, Israelis and Arabs closer in cooperation as they seek to liberate Syria from the clutches of a corrupt clan and ensure it remains free from the fanatics of Islamist fundamentalism. Closer engagement by these three regional forces through U.S. assistance now also puts in place roots for a post-al-Assad Syria that is less hostile to Israel.

"(CNN) -- On one hand, Cristiano Ronaldo is still scoring goals for fun and Gareth Bale is starting to justify his mammoth transfer fee. On the other, Real Madrid's defensive game is appalling. Carlo Ancelotti, who learned the game in a league where solidity at the back is everything, must be having kittens. So would you if your team took a three-goal lead against the bottom team in La Liga, then proceeded to hang on nervously for a 3-2 win that so easily could've ended in misery. Especially when your previous outing started similarly and ended in a 7-3 scoreline. And even more so when your next game is a trip to Juventus in the Champions League. ""A disaster,"" Ancelotti called Saturday's second-half display against city rival Rayo Vallecano, a team which had conceded 27 goals and scored just eight in 11 previous Spanish league matches. ""Against Sevilla we were 3-0 up and let them back into the game. Today the same thing happened and that is not a coincidence,"" the Italian told reporters. ""We need to change and remove the superficiality we have on the pitch, the second half was a disaster. You cannot let a team back into the game like that when you have the quality of Real Madrid. ""It is something that we have to talk about in the dressing room. It has happened twice that being in front has changed the attitude out on the field, and that is not good."" Real had started so well, with Ronaldo waltzing down the left and firing in a low shot for a third-minute opener. Rayo had a good penalty appeal turned down and a goal disallowed before Real's marquee signing Bale laid on a perfect cross for Karim Benzema to head the second just after half an hour, having been set free by Xabi Alonso. Alonso, making his first start this season, was a major factor in Real's first-half dominance but the Spain midfielder did not come back out after the break due to another fitness problem which puts him in doubt for Tuesday's trip to Italy. Nonetheless, Bale was again the provider as Ronaldo punished Rayo at the near post soon after the interval, putting the Portugal captain above Atletico Madrid's Diego Costa in the Pichichi standings with his 13th league goal this season. It was downhill from there for Real. Vallecano won two penalties in quick succession -- both converted by Jonathan Viera, one coming after Joaquin Larrivey hit the bar -- while Diego Lopez did well to tip Alberto Bueno's shot onto the post. The result left third-placed Real six points behind Barcelona -- which won 1-0 against Espanyol on Friday -- and two behind Atletico, which hosts Athletic Bilbao on Sunday. Real Sociedad moved up to seventh with a 5-0 drubbing of Osasuna, while Almeria climbed off the bottom on goal difference with a 1-0 win over Valladolid. Celta Vigo moved away from the bottom three with a 1-0 win at Sevilla -- which had conceded seven against Real in midweek. In Italy, Napoli and Juventus moved to within two points of Serie A leader Roma with respective victories on Saturday. Second-placed Napoli, which hosts Marseille in the Champions League on Wednesday, beat Catania 2-1 with first-half goals from former Real Madrid forward Jose Callejon and Slovakian Marek Hamsik -- putting both on six in the league this season. Juve, which needs to beat Real to have any chance of a place in the knockout stage, triumphed 1-0 at Parma thanks to a 77th-minute strike from midfielder Paul Pogba. Struggling AC Milan lost 2-0 at home to fourth-placed Fiorentina ahead of Wednesday's trip to Barcelona in Europe's top club competition, further progress in which may be the key to the future of under-pressure coach Massimiliano Allegri.

"(CNN) -- Mexican migration to the United States may have stalled, as a new study shows, but the political and social debates over immigrants living in the United States aren't going anywhere, experts say. The immigration debate is reflected in a number of policies and proposals, most recognizably state immigration laws that are being challenged. Oral arguments are scheduled at the Supreme Court on Wednesday as the justices decide whether Arizona can enforce its controversial immigration law. A bill in Mississippi that would require police to check the immigration status of all those arrested died in the state Senate this month. Amid the backdrop of contentious debates comes a study this week from the Pew Hispanic Center, which finds that for the first time in decades, the flow of Mexican migrants to and from the United States balances out. The effect may be even more pronounced. According to the report, ""the trend lines ... suggest that return flow to Mexico probably exceeded the inflow from Mexico during the past year or two."" ""The largest wave of immigration in history from a single country to the United States has come to a standstill,"" the report announces. The report's findings weren't a surprise to several Mexican immigrants in Los Angeles, who said they've seen the political and economic situation shift dramatically in recent years. ""It isn't like it was before. The laws have changed. The work is very hard. Life is very expensive,"" said Norma Ibarra. ""It's not the United States it was 30 years ago."" Alba Roche said her nieces in Mexico want to come to the United States, but can't. ""They haven't been able to come because of the situation, because there is not enough work, and more than anything because crossing is quite dangerous, so there are many obstacles,"" she said. Those who study immigration trends and policy agree that the apparent standstill in immigration is significant, but to varying degrees they say it will do little to change attitudes and actions in the United States. Jeffrey Passel, senior demographer at the Pew Hispanic Center and one of the report's authors, said that as Mexican families have fewer children, the number of potential immigrants is shrinking. Also, the Mexican economy is improving and providing jobs that before weren't available and provided a push to look for opportunities in the United States. ""It's likely impossible that we'll get back to the level of immigration that we saw 10 years ago. It's possible that the flows may pick up, but I don't think they will get anywhere near where they were in 2000,"" Passel said. ""People have been talking about the return flow for a couple of years, but it just wasn't showing up in the data, and now we're beginning to see it,"" he added. But the forces that pull immigrants to the United States and push them from Mexico have not disappeared. ""It's a little premature to say that part of history is over,"" said Tamar Jacoby, president and CEO of ImmigrationWorks USA, a federation of small-business owners in favor of immigration reform. There are a number of factors that may have affected the recent trend: better enforcement in the United States, demographic changes in Mexico and the economic downturn in the United States. ""We have three different reasons, and we don't know how important each one of these reasons is,"" she said. As those factors shift -- for example, as the U.S. economy improves -- the demand for immigrant workers in the United States will rise, she said. An improving situation in Mexico could result in fewer Mexicans migrating to the United States, but people from Central American countries could fill that void. Even if not as large as before, a future demand for immigrants in the United States will mean a continuation of the debates of today. The news produced in the Pew Hispanic report may relieve some people's anxieties, but for many illegal immigration critics, the real problem isn't the immigrants arriving today but the cumulative effects of immigrants who have arrived illegally over the past 30 years, Jacoby said. Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, said there is no question that immigration from Mexico has slowed, but it doesn't mean nobody is coming. ""The claim that this is a permanent development is premature,"" said Krikorian, whose center favors a restrictive approach to immigration policy. ""When our economy picks up, what happens then?"" he asked. Krikorian said he sees the pause in Mexican migration as an opportunity to build up enforcement against future illegal immigration. ""The conclusion I draw from this is that we have breathing space to put enforcement measures in place that we will need when these pressures mount again,"" he said. CNN's Jacqueline Hurtado contributed to this report.","NEW: ""It's not the United States it was 30 years ago,"" one immigrant says .

"(CNN) -- Lori Anne Madison, 6, stepped boldly Wednesday afternoon to the microphone, lowered it a bit to fit her height, and took on the word ""ingluvies"" at the National Spelling Bee. The agony and ecstasy of the National Spelling Bee . The youngest person ever to compete in the bee stumbled on the term for a bird's craw, spelling it ""engluvies."" Earlier, she correctly spelled ""dirigible."" Although Lori Anne did not make the cut of 50 semifinalists for Thursday, she won a round of applause from fellow competitors and those in the audience. Spellers took a written test on Tuesday, and those results figured into the selection of semifinalists. The competition concludes Thursday night. Lori Anne, a second-grader, joined 277 other contestants at the Scripps National Spelling Bee. She defeated 21 children in the regional bee in Prince William County in Virginia. She won by spelling the word ""vaquero,"" the Spanish translation of ""cowboy"" often used in parts of the South. While she loves spelling, Lori Anne has other interests as well. She likes to study while swinging upside down or jumping on her trampoline, according to her bio on the event's website. She's also a competitive swimmer, has won math and science awards, and takes karate, dance and tennis classes. Since 1993, there have been four spellers who were 8 years old, said Mike Hickerson, the bee's communications manager. Incentives include a $30,000 cash prize, an engraved trophy, a $2,500 U.S. savings bond and a $5,000 scholarship. Spellers range between ages 6 and 15, and come from all 50 states and U.S. territories. They include competitors from other nations, including China, Canada, Ghana and Japan. The National Spelling Bee started in 1925 under a collaboration among nine newspapers. In 1941, Scripps assumed sponsorship of the event.

"Las Vegas (CNN) -- The hacker who goes by the pseudonym CyFi won't share her real name and declines to be photographed without her signature aviator sunglasses. At the annual Def Con hacking conference here Friday, Gen. Keith Alexander, director of the National Security Agency and head of the U.S. Cyber Command, brought CyFi on stage during his keynote address and called her ""the most important person for our future."" CyFi is 11 years old. For the second year in a row, Def Con organizers included a full schedule of Def Con Kids programs for beginner hackers ages 8 to 18. The children and teens, who must be accompanied by a parent, learned how to pick locks, competed to find the most bugs in mobile apps and learned about digital forensics by investigating a mock crime scene in a hotel room. Some skilled young hackers also taught classes and gave talks. To kick off the conference, Def Con founder and veteran hacker Jeff Moss welcomed the kids with a talk on the ethics of hacking and rules for how to stay out of trouble with the law. ""I think it's harder for you guys now than it was for me,"" Moss told a room of kids and their parents. Moss started the conference in 1992 because he wanted an open place for hackers to meet in person and share information. Twenty years later, the young attendees from Def Con's early years have grown up, established careers and started families. Now they bring their own children to Def Con to soak up the knowledge and culture, but this new generation faces a different set of rules and a maze of new laws -- not to mention parents who are savvy enough to know what they're up to and keen on keeping their progeny out of trouble. Navigating the law . ""I just want to open it, but don't want to see what's on the other side,"" a young woman told and Moss and Lauren Gelman, an attorney who works in the field of Internet law and policy. Many of Def Con Kids' school-age hackers are driven by the challenge of finding vulnerabilities in security systems and networks, not stealing information or money, or selling their knowledge to third parties. These ""white-hat"" hackers report any issues they find directly to the developers or relevant companies so they can be more secure. But good intentions aren't always enough when it comes to staying out of legal trouble. When Moss was starting out, computer technology wasn't widely understood by law enforcement, and laws weren't yet in place that classified his actions as illegal. ""Technically, I wasn't committing any crimes. I wasn't stealing any money, wasn't trying to break anything,"" said Moss. The U.S. and international governments have since drafted complicated laws that criminalize many aspects of hacking. However, Gelman pointed out that in many cases, the rules are still not clear or current, and that current laws are far behind what Def Con attendees are doing. She recommended the kids avoid breaking laws by asking for permission before testing any systems, and if that's not possible, to find a situation where they can ask for approval. ""The lawyer perspective and mother perspective and ethics perspective is you can get in a lot of trouble if you don't ask for permission."" Gelman is married to journalist and former hacker Kevin Poulsen and has two children. Moss has his own test for deciding whether to hack something: ""My rule of thumb is, do I completely own it? If yes, I can hack it."" If hackers are unsure whether they are breaking the law, Gelman suggests they check the Electronic Frontier Foundation's (EFF) site, which spells out rules for everyone from bloggers to coders. The 22-year-old organization also provides legal assistance for those who do get in trouble, taking on some cases itself or referring people to attorneys. Building a reputation . Breaking the law isn't the only concern Moss, Gelman and parents have for the budding hackers -- true anonymity online is harder to come by and a bad reputation can follow these kids into adulthood. Moss warned the kids that everything they do online now until they die will be backed up to the cloud. ""That makes life more difficult for you guys, because if you get in trouble now, you're screwed."" Twenty years ago, hackers could operate in the shadows without leaving much of a trail. Chat logs weren't recorded for long and hackers' handles weren't easily traceable to their real-life identities. Now, most communications that take place online are stored permanently and some can be dug up by law enforcement and human-resources departments. Moss was just a kid himself when he got started with computers. At 13, his father brought home an IBM computer for the family. By 14, Moss was online creating a new identity for himself, conversing with adults who were oblivious to his real age and spoke to him like an equal. ""I couldn't drive a car, but I could have conversations about politics with people in Russia,"" he said. In those days, if someone made a mistake or needed a fresh start, they could create a new online identity. Moss got a do-over at an early age and recreated himself online as Dark Tangent, which grew into a trusted and respected identity he still uses now. Today, a fresh start is harder to come by and old communications can surface at any time. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg learned this the hard way when embarrassing instant-message conversations from his college days were made public years later. ""Your reputation is the most important thing you own,"" said Moss, urging the young hackers to behave ethically, not because it will make their parents happy, but because they are the ones who will have to live with the results. Hacking for good . With so many dangers, why would parents encourage their children to hack at all? Def Con Kids organizers believe in the good that can come from hacking, including making the country more secure and helping encourage freedom of speech around the world. ""Technology can really change the world,"" said Gelman, citing the liberation-technology movement that encourages hackers to help people spread messages from countries where online communication is restricted. The U.S. government sees the potential in these bright young minds as well. The Department of Defense ran the digital forensics program at Def Con Kids, hoping to encourage more education and interest in the field. And Alexander met with three of the children before going on stage to give his keynote address. ""This is our future,"" Alexander said of the kids. ""What you're doing here to help train those folks is absolutely superb, and you should be proud.""","Def Con Kids is a program at the annual Def Con hackers conference in Las Vegas .

"(CNN) -- Students asked to fork out thousands of Kenyan shillings for a bursary; drivers pushed to pay police officers for traffic offences; people asked to shell out large sums to speed up the process of getting a new passport or making a land transfer. These are just some of the most common reports of bribery that can be found in ipaidabribe.or.ke, a recently-launched website dedicated to battling rampant public corruption in Kenya and uncovering its economic impact. The initiative, which was launched last December by Antony Ragui, a 37-year-old financial services consultant, allows victims of graft to share their bribe stories anonymously and track incidents of corruption online. ""I came back to the country from the States about four years ago and I would listen to a lot of Kenyans complain about corruption on social media, on Twitter, on private blogs and I basically got tired of it,"" says Ragui. ""I said now it's time for me to do something different."" Read more: Crooked top officials should take a fall, says Kenyan corruption chief . Based on a similar site launched a few years ago in India to curb corruption, Ragui's online platform is divided in three categories, containing detailed information about the amount of money paid and the location of the bribe. The first section contains stories about bribes that were paid, breaking down the numbers by region and government department. The second collects stories from people who refused to pay a bribe, while the third contains stories of honesty, where citizens were not asked to pay a public official. Until now, Ragui's site has hosted nearly 600 cases of, mainly petty, bribery worth around 17 million Kenyan shillings (Â£204,000). ""Corruption is a huge issue: it's so endemic and the worst part about it is it becomes a way of life,"" says Ragui, who's also about to roll out an SMS service that will allow citizens to report their stories instantaneously via their mobile phones. ""So what I'm trying to do with the site essentially is to get people to create a network of anti-corruption people -- people who feel that this has to come to an end and we need to make a difference."" Opinion: Can Kenya avoid Africa's resource curse? According to anti-corruption group Transparency International, Kenya is one of the world's most corrupt countries. The group's 2011 East African Bribery Index said that there is a 67% chance that Kenyans would be expected to pay a bribe every time they interacted with the police. Overall, the cost of corruption in Africa is estimated at more than $148 billion a year, according to African Union estimates. Yet ipaidabribe.or.ke is not the only attempt to use information technology as a tool in the fight against corruption in Africa as an increasing number of similar websites have popped up across the continent. Also based on India's I Paid A Bribe, Bribe Nigeria was set up last summer by Leonard Raphael to raise awareness about corruption and address its impact on the West African country. ""Corruption is an endemic disease that has eaten up every facet of the Nigerian society,"" says Raphael, pointing to the case of a father who was asked by police officers to give them money for fuel after they came to his house to search for his son who was just kidnapped. ""As soon as corruption can be controlled in Nigeria, every other sustainable development can henceforth progress,"" adds Raphael. In South Africa, Corruption Watch was launched in late January in a bid to encourage people to join their voices against the problem. So far, the group says it has collected some 1,200 reports from all corners of the country through its online reporting form, an SMS line, social media and by email or post. ""It's designed principally to show to people that by reporting and by speaking up something can happen,"" says the group's executive director David Lewis. ""The way of changing things in a democracy is to speak up and to speak as much as possible with a connected voice,"" he adds. Read more: The Africans looking to make it in China . Ben Elers, director of programs at Transparency International, says that all these initiatives can be a powerful tool in the fight against corruption. ""I think they are essential in giving citizens a voice, they're enabling them to voice their frustrations,"" he says. He adds, however, that since the complaints are generally anonymous, it can be difficult to follow up on them. ""Ultimately they are tools and what happens afterwards in changing the physical world is what counts at the end of the day,"" he says. ""So, they are critical but in of themselves they're not sufficient, they need concrete follow-up afterwards."" Back in Kenya, Ragui is optimistic that the use of technology can help things change. ""Kenyans are tired,"" he says. ""We need a new generation of Kenyans who are actually positive, hard-working, people who don't want to get a short-term gain, people who are actually thinking the only way to make a difference in our country is for people to say no to corruption.""","African activists are increasingly turning to technology to fight endemic corruption .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Three-time Major League all-star outfielder Lenny Dykstra, who amassed a fortune in professional baseball and financial advising, pleaded guilty Friday to bankruptcy fraud and other federal charges, authorities announced. Dykstra, 49, pleaded guilty to three felony counts -- bankruptcy fraud, concealment of assets and money laundering. As result of the guilty pleas, Dykstra faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison. He is currently serving a three-year state prison sentence after pleading no contest to grand theft auto in a separate case. ""Mr. Dykstra's days of playing games with the public and the legal system are over. With these federal convictions, Mr. Dykstra's fraud and deceit have been exposed for all to see,"" U.S. Attorney Andre Birotte Jr. in Los Angeles said in a statement. The federal indictment stemmed from a bankruptcy case that Dykstra filed on July 7, 2009. Dykstra was accused of removing, destroying and selling property that was part of the bankruptcy estate without the permission of the bankruptcy trustee. According to court documents, after Dykstra filed for bankruptcy, he sold many items belonging to the estate for cash. An attorney hired by the bankruptcy trustee estimated that Dykstra stole or destroyed more than $400,000 worth of property in the estate, according to the original criminal complaint. Dykstra also admitted that he concealed property from the bankruptcy estate, items that included baseball memorabilia stored in his other mansion. Dykstra admitted that he sold some of the memorabilia and laundered the proceeds by taking $15,000 earned from the sale and purchasing a cashier's check in another person's name. ""At one time, Mr. Dykstra inspired Americans but later, sadly, he chose to defraud his fellow Americans and the United States government,"" Timothy Delaney, the FBI's acting assistant director in charge in Los Angeles, said in a statement. In his bankruptcy filing, Dykstra listed assets of $24.6 million and overall debts of $37.1 million. Among the assets listed were two residences: a Ventura County mansion in Lake Sherwood Estates he had purchased from celebrity couple Janet and Wayne Gretzky that he estimated was worth $18.5 million, and a home in Westlake Village that he estimated was worth $5.4 million, according to the bankruptcy filing. As a result of the filing, the residences and Dykstra's personal property became part of the bankruptcy estate that would be used to pay off creditors. In his plea Friday, Dykstra specifically admitted he committed bankruptcy fraud by lying about whether he had taken and sold items from his $18 million mansion in Sherwood Estates that he had purchased from the Gretzkys. Dykstra also admitted that there were at least 10 creditors who were victims of his crimes, and those victims lost between $200,000 and $400,000. Dykstra was also accused of confiscating a $50,000 custom sink and allegedly receiving cash at a Los Angeles consignment store for other personal items and fixtures taken from the mansion, according to the complaint. ""These convictions should serve as a cautionary tale of a high-flying sports celebrity who tried to manipulate and exploit both his creditors and the bankruptcy laws of the United States,"" said Birotte. By the time he retired, Dykstra had earned $36.5 million from Major League Baseball, according to Baseball-Reference.com. His last season was 1996. After retirement, Dykstra moved to California and started a profitable luxury car wash that he called The Taj Mahal. He expanded the business throughout Southern California and in 2007 sold it to investors, according to bankruptcy filings. As a self-taught financial analyst, Dykstra proclaimed himself a financial guru and began writing a stock-picking website column. His prominence soared as a sports celebrity, entrepreneur and popular guest on numerous financial news broadcasts. In 2008, Dykstra began publishing the Players Club, a glossy financial advice magazine exclusively for pro athletes to help them with wealth management and investment banking. But Dykstra seemed to lose control of his extravagant jet-setting lifestyle during the housing bust. His purchase of the palatial Gretzky estate in 2007 for $14 million occurred a few months before the mortgage market collapse. By the time Dykstra filed for bankruptcy in July 2009, he had accumulated loans totaling $21 million, bankruptcy records show. Dykstra's stellar professional baseball career began in 1981, when the New York Mets drafted him out of high school. During his second year in the majors, the player was nicknamed ""Nails"" for his tenacity to hit a lead-off home run in Game 3 of the 1986 World Series at Boston's Fenway Park, after the Mets lost the first two games. That spark rallied the Mets to a seven-game series victory over the Boston Red Sox. When Dykstra was charged with bankruptcy fraud in 2009 his only income was a $5,700 monthly pension from Major League Baseball, records show. Dykstra is scheduled for sentencing on December 3.

"(CNN) -- The next wave of smartphones and tablets might have super-sturdy screens fashioned from the human-made version of a gemstone. Manufactured sapphire, a substance already used to armor some military vehicles, would be an almost unbreakable alternative to the glass now used on the displays of mobile devices, according to a report in the MIT Technology Review. Sapphire is the second-hardest material on the planet, behind only diamond. According to the MIT report, a sapphire smartphone screen wouldn't break when you dropped it and couldn't be scratched with a car key or by a sidewalk. ""I'm convinced that some (manufacturers) will start testing the water and release some high-end smartphones using sapphire in 2013,"" Eric Virey, an analyst for the market research firm Yole DÃ©veloppement, said in the report. Currently, Apple uses manufactured sapphire to protect the camera lens on its iPhone 5. Manufactured sapphire is made by melting down aluminum oxide, the compound that crystallizes into sapphire in nature, allowing it to cool and then cutting it with a diamond-coated wire saw. One stumbling block could be price. Currently, a sapphire display for a smartphone would cost about $30, compared with $3 for the screens made by Corning's Gorilla Glass, the protective cover that's on more than 1 billion devices. The MIT report estimates that sapphire would be about three times stronger than Gorilla Glass. But Corning spokesman Daniel Collins said the company isn't too worried. ""It is unclear to us if this could provide better overall performance than actual glass,"" he wrote in an e-mail. ""There also are the questions about cost and product weight that must be addressed before sapphire would be a serious consideration for mass market applications."" Collins noted that Gorilla Glass can be molded into curved designs and multiple shapes without losing its strength, and he questioned whether the same could be said for manufactured sapphire. The company says its most recent product, Gorilla Glass 3, will be in phones this year and is twice as strong as previous versions. Virey said the cost for a sapphire screen could fall to $20 in the next few years, which might be affordable enough to make consumers give it a shot. Another alternative would be ultrathin (and less costly) sapphire covers that would fit over glass screens for added durability. GT Advanced Technologies, a New Hampshire company, is developing a method to make synthetic sapphire sheets that are the width of a human hair. Other companies in the United States, South Korea and Russia are working on similar technologies. ""If costs can get low enough, these manufacturers may have a large market waiting for them,"" Kevin Bullis, senior editor of the MIT Technology Review, wrote in the report. ""But they'll have to continue to contend with the incumbent technologies -- Gorilla Glass and similar materials offered by other manufacturers.""","Manufactured sapphire could be on screens for smartphones and tablets .

The former Pennsylvania senator and runner-up in this year's GOP race criticized President Barack Obama during his convention speech for what he called a belief ""in government handouts and dependency."" In addition to repeating a debunked claim that Obama rolled back work requirements for welfare recipients, Santorum said that under the Obama administration, ""the dream of freedom and opportunity has become a nightmare of dependence, with almost half of America receiving some sort of government assistance.""

It also includes other benefits, such as worker's compensation or educational assistance for veterans. -- The number of people who qualify for ""means-tested"" benefits, which require applicants to have incomes below a certain level, was 35.1%, according to the Census Bureau. -- By comparison, when the already-slumping U.S. economy began to nosedive in September 2008, about 24% of U.S. households received means-tested benefits such as welfare or food stamps, according to Census Bureau figures.

"Moscow (CNN) -- Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader, called Wednesday for new parliamentary elections in Russia over concerns about vote fraud. ""Mikhail Gorbachev is very concerned about how the situation in Russia is developing,"" spokesman Pavel Palezhchenko told CNN. ""People don't believe that the will of the people is reflected in the results."" He confirmed a report by the Russian news agency Interfax, which quoted the former Communist party general secretary as saying the elections were unfair and new elections were needed. Demonstrators have been protesting against what they describe as electoral fraud in Sunday's national vote, which kept Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's party in power but significantly decreased the number of seats it holds in Parliament. Opponents of Putin vowed to continue protesting the election results despite the arrests of at least 250 demonstrators Tuesday. However, a planned opposition rally in Moscow failed to materialize Wednesday, with a heavy security presence in the square where thousands of demonstrators were expected to march, but no visible protesters. Organizers had expected about 2,000 people for the demonstration, they said earlier Wednesday. Rights group Amnesty International said in a statement that Russian authorities ""must halt police mistreatment of election protesters, journalists and detainees"" before further planned rallies. Nearly 16,000 people have already said on Facebook they will demonstrate in Moscow on Saturday, which would be one of the largest opposition protests in the Russian capital in years. Amnesty said more than 1,000 people, including journalists, had reportedly been detained following election protests, of whom possibly more than 100 remain in detention. It had received numerous reports of mistreatment of detainees and beatings of peaceful protesters by police, the group said, with some denied medical treatment. ""The scale of arrests has not been in any way justified,"" said John Dalhuisen, Amnesty's deputy director for Europe and Central Asia. ""We fear that the Russian police are simply quashing opposition protest, no matter how peaceful."" Some protesters at opposition rallies have been arrested ""simply for shouting 'Freedom' or 'We need another Russia,'"" he said, while pro-government supporters gathered in the same location have been left untouched. Boris Nemtsov, a former deputy prime minister turned vocal government opponent, told CNN he was among those detained at a rally Tuesday. Putin's United Russia party held a separate demonstration. Police said there were about 8,000 people there. Tuesday's anti-Putin protests drew much smaller crowds than a similar rally in Moscow Monday, where thousands of demonstrators turned out for an event state news agency RIA Novosti described as the largest opposition demonstration in years. Protesters Tuesday were met with a firm response from security forces, who dispersed many and made arrests. But some analysts said the presence of protesters was a significant sign that could prove a turning point in Russian politics. ""This isn't a surprise that the party got fewer votes. I think the real surprise are the number of people who went out on the street,"" said Toby Gati, a senior international adviser at the Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld firm. As simmering anger over allegations of official corruption and economic stagnation appear to be boiling over. Putin has promised to make changes, including reshuffling his Cabinet. He said the losses his party suffered in Sunday's elections were inevitable. ""They are unavoidable for any political power, especially a political power that has held the responsibility for the state of a country for some time,"" he said after results were announced. One observer said Sunday's election results, which left United Russia with a slim majority in the 450-seat house, signal that the leader's grip on power was weakening. ""Whatever else they reveal, Sunday's results undercut the image, common in the West, of Putin's regime as an effective authoritarian state,"" Daniel Treisman, professor of political science at the University of California, Los Angeles, wrote in a column for CNN. ""In fact, it is a regime that cannot even steal an election decisively."" But Matthew Rojansky, deputy director of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Carnegie Endowment, cautioned that this week's protests were fueled by the frustrations of a ""liberal fringe,"" not the majority of the population. ""The bulk of Russians... still have negative memories of the last time a government went down. They're not terribly interested in feeding chaos,"" he said. ""It's not the Arab Spring on the streets of Moscow."" A preliminary report from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe on Sunday's election said some political parties had been prevented from running and the vote was ""slanted in favor of the ruling party."" A draft report by the organization's election-observer mission details alleged attempts to stuff ballot boxes, manipulate voter lists and harass election monitors. The group, which monitors and promotes democracy and human rights, cited the lack of an independent body running the election or impartial news media.

"(CNN) -- Nearly 5,000 cave paintings found in northeastern Mexico were made by at least three groups of hunter-gatherers who lived in an area previously thought to have been uninhabited, archeologists said. The drawings were discovered in 2006 in a number of caves in the San Carlos mountain range near the modern-day town of Burgos, about 100 miles south of the U.S. border. The first findings about the red markings that depict people, shapes and designs were revealed this week at a conference in Mexico City. Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History has been cataloging and studying the drawings for the past two years. Archeologist Martha Garcia Sanchez said the paintings include human and animal shapes, and relate to astronomy. They're abstract in nature, she said. ""Their importance is that based on them, we have been able to document the presence of pre-Hispanic groups in Burgos, where before it was believed there was nothing, when in reality it was inhabited by one or several cultures,"" she said. Burgos is in Tamaulipas state, which borders Texas. The ages of the cave paintings remain uncertain for now because archaeologists have not found any objects in the area that could help date them, said another archeologist, Gustavo Ramirez. Rains have also swept away sediment in the area, making that method of dating unavailable, too, he said. At least three nomadic hunter-gatherer groups -- the Guajolotes, Iconoplos and Pintos -- are believed to have made the 4,926 drawings. The images indicate that the groups prioritized hunting, fishing and gathering, Garcia said. Other drawings appear to depict religious and astronomical themes, she said. Drawings of what appear to be teepees, local plants and animals like deer, lizards and centipedes can tell researchers about how the populations lived. Drawings in one cave depicted an atlatl, a pre-Hispanic hunting tool that had not been previously found in other cave art in this part of Mexico, Garcia said. Little is known about the indigenous groups that lived in the mountains near Burgos, she said. These groups evaded Spanish colonists for nearly 200 years, she said, because they had the means to survive in the mountains, where the Spanish wouldn't venture.","Nearly 5,000 cave painting were discovered in northeastern Mexico in 2006 .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- At least 24 people were killed and 33 were injured in Saturday's audacious Maoist attack on a political motorcade in India's Chhattisgarh state, the province's home secretary told CNN Sunday. No arrests have been made so far, but investigations have begun, Chhattisgarh's Home Secretary N.K. Aswal said. The assault on a convoy of politicians from the country's ruling Congress party also killed Mahendra Karma, founder of a controversial anti-Maoist tribal militia called Salwa Judam, or the Purification Hunt, authorities say. At least 16 cars in the motorcade of local Congress leaders were passing through a forested area in the eastern Indian state when Maoists triggered a land mine and opened fire on them, area Police Superintendent Mayank Srivastava told CNN. At least 200 guerrillas were involved in the ambush, Srivastava said, citing witness accounts. Among the dead were eight policemen, three laborers and some car drivers, he added. On Sunday, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh visited some of the injured in a hospital in Raipur, the capital of Chhattisgarh state. He was accompanied by his Congress party chief Sonia Gandhi. ""We will pursue the perpetrators of this crime with urgency, and I can assure the nation that the government is committed to bringing them to justice,"" Singh said. Saturday's Maoist raid came barely three days after Singh announced what he called a significant decline in killings by left-wing insurgents, whom the federal government describes as the nation's gravest internal security threat. ""The quantum of violence as well as the resultant killings perpetrated by the left-wing extremist groups in 2012 declined significantly for the second successive year,"" said a report Singh released on Wednesday to mark the fourth anniversary of his second term in office. He insisted his government has continued to provide public infrastructure and services in tribal districts hit by Maoist extremism. The rebels, officials say, aim to seize power through an armed liberation struggle. Since the 1960s, the militants have said they are fighting for the dispossessed. Authorities suspect that Maoists enjoy support not only in the poorest areas and in tribal communities but also among youth and intellectuals. In addition to targeting police, alleged police informers and people they call ""class enemies,"" the insurgents also are believed to be attacking infrastructure such as roads, bridges, railways, and power and telecommunication networks.","Maoist rebels detonate a land mine, open fire on a political motorcade .

"(CNN) -- Pauline Phillips, better known to millions of newspaper readers as the original Dear Abby advice columnist, has died after a long battle with Alzheimer's Disease, her family said Thursday. She died Wednesday in Minneapolis, Minnesota, at age 94. Phillips' columns were published in an era when newspaper readers began to prize straight-talking, pithy advice about marriages, children, jobs -- just about anything that troubled people. Phillips wrote under the pen name of Abigail Van Buren, shortened to ""Dear Abby"" in newspapers. ""Abigail"" was taken from the wise woman in the Old Testament and ""Van Buren"" was one of her favorite presidents. The first Dear Abby column appeared in 1956, and Phillips solely wrote the advice feature until 2000, when she and daughter Jeanne began sharing the byline. Jeanne Phillips took the column over full time in August 2002, when the family announced that Pauline Phillips had Alzheimer's. ""I have lost my mother, my mentor and my best friend,"" Jeanne Phillips said in a statement. ""My mother leaves very big high heels to fill with a legacy of compassion, commitment and positive social change. I will honor her memory every day by continuing this legacy."" Pauline Phillips strove to say more with less. Her direct style was captured in her favorite Swedish toast, according to the column's syndication service: . ""Fear less; hope more. Eat less; chew more. Talk less; say more. Hate less; love more."" What was your favorite Dear Abby advice? Before the digital era of journalism introduced such notions as ""crowd sourcing"" of the public and computerized metrics on readership, Phillips assembled her Q&A columns from queries mailed in from readers. She was able to quantify her following by the number of newspapers who bought her columns -- and by how many readers spent money on a stamp to mail her a letter. ""Dear Abby"" is the world's most widely syndicated column, having appeared in 1,400 newspapers with a daily readership of more than 110 million, the syndication service Universal Uclick said. In another example of her following, Phillips held a survey in 1987 asking readers to send a postcard or note -- anonymously if they wanted -- about whether they cheated on their mates. Almost 250,000 people responded within three months. Her twin sister was also a famous advice columnist. Esther ""Eppie"" Pauline Friedman Lederer, who died at age 83 in 2002 of multiple myeloma, was the author of the newspaper column ""Ann Landers."" Phillips, who was born July 4, 1918, in Sioux City, Iowa, ventured into journalism in 1955 at age 37. She called the editor of the San Francisco Chronicle and told him she could write a better advice column than what the paper had. Phillips was surprised when the editor agreed to interview her. She described herself as ""an average, middle-aged housewife who had been happily married to the same man for 17 years and had reared two 'reasonably normal' teenagers,"" according to a statement by the syndicate. She had never written professionally, though she studied journalism in college. But she asserted she could write an advice column ""because all of her life she had been an amateur 'wailing wall without portfolio,' "" the syndicate said. Dear Abby: Kyra Phillips remembers her mentor . Editor Stanleigh Arnold ""wanted only to get this self-styled journalist out of his office, so he asked her to write sample replies to some previously published columns. She did, and the rest, as they say, is history,"" the syndicate said. The first ""Dear Abby"" column appeared in the San Francisco Chronicle on Jan. 9, 1956, the same year it was first syndicated. Phillips advocated ""equal rights for women, minorities, people with mental illness and those who are physically challenged,"" and her column ""promoted AIDS awareness and education, hospice care, the living will, organ donation and also raised awareness about gender apartheid suffered by women in Afghanistan,"" the syndicate said. When asked of her greatest accomplishment, Phillips often stated: ""Surviving."" In a 1990 interview with CNN's Larry King, Phillips explained the bottom line of dispensing advice: . ""There is always an answer, even if it's say, look, pal, you can't change anybody but yourself. You got to play the cards that are dealt you and you have to live with this, do the best you can. But you got to accept what fate deals you,"" Phillips said. She is survived by her husband of 73 years, Mort Phillips; daughter Jeanne Phillips; grandchildren, Dean Phillips, Tyler Phillips, Jay Phillips, Hutton Phillips; and two great-granddaughters, Daniela and Pia. Private services have been held. People we've lost in 2013: The lives they lived .","NEW: ""There is always an answer, even if it's...you can't change anybody but yourself,"" she said .

"London (CNN) -- Years before two men allegedly hacked a British soldier to death on a London street, Kenyan authorities arrested one of the suspects on suspicion of terror ties. In 2010, Kenyan police detained Michael Adebolajo and six others suspected of links to Somalia's Al-Shabaab terrorist group, Kenyan government spokesman Muthui Kariuki said. Kenyan counterterrorism sources told CNN that Adebolajo traveled to Kenya in November 2010 and was arrested for trying to cross illegally into Somalia. Authorities have offered different accounts of what happened next. The Kenyan government spokesman told CNN that British security officials interrogated Adebolajo, a 28-year-old British national of Nigerian descent who went by a different name at the time. The British Foreign Office said that it provided consular assistance to a British national arrested in Kenya in 2010, but declined to provide further details. It's unclear why Adebolajo traveled to Kenya or what happened after his 2010 arrest. But authorities are looking into his travels to the region as part of their investigation into the soldier's killing Wednesday in Woolwich, a working class neighborhood in southeast London. CNN understands that one line of inquiry being examined in the Woolwich terror investigation is that Adebolajo might have attempted -- but failed -- to travel to Somalia on another occasion, as recently as last year. Last week's attack near the Royal Artillery Barracks shocked people across the United Kingdom, sparked a series of arrests over the weekend and prompted officials to announce plans for a task force to tackle extremism in Britain. On Saturday, angry far-right protesters in northern England pointed to the soldier's slaying and called for Muslims to leave the United Kingdom. At the scene of the gory attack, one of the suspects apparently approached a man filming the scene in the Woolwich neighborhood and suggested that Rigby had been targeted ""because Muslims are dying daily"" at the hands of British troops like him. ""We must fight them as they fight us,"" he said in the video aired by CNN affiliate ITN. ""An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth."" 'Armies of one': Are long wolf attacks the future of terrorism? Friends, acquaintances and British media have identified Adebolajo as the suspect seen in the gory video. Authorities have not identified that individual or the 22-year-old man seized with him at the scene by armed police. Both suspects were shot and remain hospitalized. British authorities, including Prime Minister David Cameron, have described the soldier's brutal slaying as a terror attack. In total, six people have been arrested in connection with the attack, including three men who were taken into custody Saturday, and another on Sunday. The men were being held on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder, the Metropolitan Police said in a statement. Far-right marchers rally amid tensions over Woolwich killing . 'Changed and withdrawn' Adebolajo was a changed man when he returned to the United Kingdom from Kenya, according to a man who described himself as an associate of the suspect. In an interview with BBC's ""Newsnight,"" Abu Nusaybah said Adebolajo was physically assaulted and sexually threatened during his detention in Kenya -- an allegation CNN has not independently verified. Adebolajo appeared changed and withdrawn after his return from the east African nation, Abu Nusaybah said. Afterward, Abu Nusaybah said, Britain's MI5 domestic intelligence service approached Adebolajo and asked if he wanted to work for them. A security source told CNN that ""we would never comment"" on the kind of allegations Abu Nusaybah made in the interview. After the interview, British counterterrorism police arrested Abu Nusaybah, accvording to a BBC staffer who did not wish to be named. London's Metropolitan Police Service said a 31-year-old man had been arrested in London on Friday night on terrorism-related offenses, but following standard practice, would not give the arrested man's name. A Scotland Yard spokesman told CNN the arrest at the BBC was not connected to the murder investigation in Woolwich. Tributes pour in for soldier slain in cleaver attack . Islamist connections claimed . Adebolajo had been a follower of Al-Muhajiroun, a British group of Islamic extremists virulently opposed to UK intervention in Iraq and openly supportive of al Qaeda, according to several Al-Muhajiroun insiders. He attended meetings of the group in London, they said, before moving away from the group two or three years ago. Details about his purported connections to Somalia's Al-Shabaab movement are unclear. The Islamist militants control much of southern Somalia and have long been affiliated with al Qaeda. In 2011, Kenya sent forces to the neighboring nation to battle Al-Shabaab, which it blamed for kidnapping foreigners and launching grenade and gun attacks in Kenya. Cub Scout leader, ex-teacher confronted London terrorist . Kariuki, the Kenyan government spokesman, said that Adebolajo was arrested in the coastal town of Lamu in 2010 and released to British security officials inside Kenya. No charges were filed against Adebolajo, according to the Kenyan media. Lamu is part of an area near the Somali border that has been the stage for attacks by armed gangs and suspected operatives from Al-Shabaab. On Sunday, one Kenyan official pointed to the 2010 arrest of Adebolajo and other British nationals as a sign that his country's approach fighting terrorism was working. ""On (the) war against terrorism, Kenya security forces have been ahead of the curve,"" said Bitange Ndemo, who heads Kenya's information ministry. ""In 2010 our security forces arrested a number of British nationals on suspicion of terrorism activities. Relevant British authorities in Kenya were contacted.

"(CNN) -- When renowned economist Jeffrey Sachs visited rural villages in sub-Saharan Africa in 2005, he saw impoverished communities with poor drinking water, feast-and-famine crop cycles and rampant malaria infections. What he didn't see was mobile phones. ""Now mobile phone ownership is perhaps 30% of households and cell phone coverage is widespread,"" said Sachs, director of the United Nations Millennium Villages Project, which focuses on improving 14 rural villages across 10 African countries as a model for wider prosperity in the region. The advent of the mobile society may have brought convenience and a cultural sea change to the U.S. and Europe, but in the poorest regions of the world, affordable mobile phone access has caused a quantum leap in services -- like calling for medical help, sending a quick letter to loved ones or starting a savings account -- that Americans and Europeans have taken for granted for generations, analysts say. ""The cell phone is the single most transformative technology for development,"" said Sachs, head of the Earth Institute at Columbia University and author of the 2005 book ""The End of Poverty."" ""Poverty is almost equated with isolation in many places of the world. Poverty results from the lack of access to markets, to emergency health services, access to education, the ability to take advantage of government services and so on,"" Sachs said. ""What the mobile phone -- and more generally IT technology -- is ending is that kind of isolation in all its different varieties."" Moreover, the profusion of payment services via cell phones puts places like Kenya and Uganda in the vanguard of mobile financial services. ""You can walk in the middle of rural village in Rwanda and use a mobile phone to pay at a recharging station to recharge LED lights,"" says Amanda Gardiner, acting program manager of Business Call to Action, a New York-based non-profit organization that is helping to bring more mobile phones to Africa's rural poor. ""I'm always flabbergasted I don't walk into Home Depot and see these services here, just swipe your cell phone and go,"" Gardiner said. ""In some ways, they're really leaping ahead of us and going right to the future."" Kenya's ""mobile-money"" revolution . From 2005 to 2010, cell phone use tripled in the developing world to nearly 4 billion mobile subscriptions, according to the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). Nowhere was the growth faster than in Africa, which saw mobile use grow more than 400% during that time frame, according to ITU. That means more money -- a 2006 University of Michigan study found that every 10% increase in cell phone penetration grows the local economy by 0.6%. The simple ability to make a phone call has far-reaching economic consequences, Sachs said. ""Places where traditionally, people would walk livestock for a week or two without knowing what kind of price they'll fetch -- should they go to Khartoum, Nairobi or Port Saeed? Now they can call ahead and find out where to get the best price,"" Sachs said. The low cost of setting up mobile towers and plunging costs of handsets has allowed cell phone coverage to grow even in poor, rural locations, said Michael Joseph, former CEO of Safaricom, a Kenyan telecom provider which grew from 17,000 users when he started in 2000 to more than 18 million when he stepped down in 2010. ""There's probably more pervasive coverage in Kenya than in many areas in Europe,"" Joseph said. Business models set up for selling services to the poor -- such as buying pre-paid phone service and charging by the second rather than the minute -- made cell phone use affordable, but Safaricom's development of banking services via cell phones revolutionized the telecom business in poor countries. Safaricom, in partnership with the U.K.'s Vodafone, started M-PESA (short for mobile pesa, Swahili for ""money"") services in 2007 that allow customers to digitally transfer cash via mobile phones. Two years later, 10% of the country's GDP was being circulated through M-PESA, according to a 2010 World Bank report. Now Kenyans make $1 billion a month in transactions via M-PESA, where cash can be deposited and transferred at one of 20,000 stores, Joseph said. ""The growth of GDP in Kenya would be half what it was the past 10 years if it wasn't for the mobile phone,"" said Joseph. ""About 70% of all jobs in Kenya are in the informal sector -- selling goods on the side of the road, that sort of thing -- and now to start a business all you need is a cell phone,"" said Joseph, who now is a fellow at the World Bank focusing on mobile money services. As a result of M-PESA, more cash is moving -- and staying -- in smaller villages, building up the local economy, said Olga Morawczynski, who spent 18 months in Kenya studying the impact of mobile banking services there. ""Now that money is being delivered locally, they didn't have to physically go to the nearest urban center to get cash,"" said Morawczynski, who is now working in Uganda on mobile banking programs for the Grameen Foundation's AppLab program. ""I noticed village stores had seen a demand in 'city goods' -- things you wouldn't typically get in the villages before like furniture, or a particular hair-straightening product for women. Mobile apps for poverty . Cell phone technology has unleashed new ways to help the poor in developing countries, Sachs said, but businesses have led the way. ""Cell phones are spreading almost entirely on a market basis ... only now are we starting to get the applications for it on the social services side,"" Sachs said. ""And the genius of prepaid phone cards has made it possible for the poor to gain access to this technology without government involvement ... it's largely governments stepping out of the way and letting commercial companies come in."" Safaricom's mobile banking model is being brought to areas from Bangladesh to Uganda. The United Nations Development Bank last month announced a program to bring mobile phone service to 3 million more poor people in Africa and South Asia by 2013. Mobile technology is now being used in Gambia to track medication stock levels in rural villages, Gardiner said. For the UN Millennium Project villages, the pre-paid mobile card is now being used as a model for pre-paid electrical service. ""We're able to do very quick mapping and needs assessments with smartphone with GIS capability,"" said Sachs, project director. ""We can cover an area of assessment in weeks, something that used to take years."" ""The most powerful thing about cell phones is how it has released money flow incountries that have poor infrastructure and often are in crisis situations,"" Morawczynski said. ""It also teaches people terms such as 'pin number', 'account', and 'transfer,' these kind of technical foreign terms that serve as a nice transitional toward using financial banking services for the first time. People are realizing it's better than keeping money buried in the ground.""","Affordable mobile phone access has caused a quantum leap for the world's poor .

"(CNN) -- ""Hey, Precious."" Cherie Hart Steffen turned toward her professor in the hall of their community college. ""What?"" she asked, sure she had misheard. ""Precious -- you know, from the movie,"" he repeated. The students around them started laughing. Steffen could only stare in disbelief. He had just compared her to Gabourey Sidibe's obese character in the 2009 film. ""It was like ... someone hit me with a frying pan on my head,"" she remembers. Her mind flashed back to just six months before, when she had gotten a life-changing call. It was June 2009. Her mother -- her best friend in the world -- was dying. Steffen drove all night in hopes of seeing her one last time. LaVerne Hart managed to give her youngest daughter just two pieces of advice before succumbing to the cancer that had spread throughout her body. ""Save money. Lose weight,"" Steffen recites, her mother's words forever etched into her brain. Steffen hadn't listened immediately. A herniated disk in her lower back had prevented her from working out; grief had made her turn to comfort food. In the months since her mother's death she had gained 30 to 40 pounds. But that moment with her professor was the last straw. ""This is it,"" she thought, as the crowd around her dissipated. ""Let's do this."" A model's daughter . Steffen's older sisters were naturally thin. They took after their mother, who had been a model. Steffen did not. She grew up ""husky"" and steadily gained weight throughout her teenage years. She and her mother fought constantly over her size. Hart would push her daughter to lose weight, but continued to buy junk food for the whole family. ""Bless her heart, she didn't know how to really deal with it,"" Steffen remembers. ""I'm eating what everyone else is eating. ... None of her other children looked like me."" In desperation, Steffen tried everything from crash diets to extreme exercise to battle the bulge. At one point, she was eating fewer than 500 calories a day. She would lose weight for a short time and then put it right back on when real life won out. Shopping was miserable. ""They don't really make large clothing that's attractive,"" she says. ""Everything just looks like a tarp."" She longingly watched as her friends tried on cute clothes and went on dates. Her first kiss was postponed until college. Eventually she carried 230 pounds on her 5-foot-3-inch frame. Slow and steady . The humiliating ""Precious"" incident took place in January 2010. That night, Steffen got on her treadmill at home and walked for 10 minutes. It was rough, but she promised herself she'd do it again the next day. She was going to take the weight off no matter how long it took. Every day she walked just a little bit longer, a little bit farther. By year's end, she had lost 30 pounds and worked her way up to a jog. She still hadn't exercised outside her house, fearing embarrassment. She would be graduating soon with a degree in criminal justice, and thought she might make a good police officer. She started training for the fitness test, but a stress fracture in her tibia prevented her from attending tryouts at the academy. Depression crept in. Steffen thought about what she really wanted to do. She realized she was happy with her new health routine. Could she work in the fitness industry? She did some research and came across the National Academy of Sports Medicine's certified personal training program. Personal training is a booming job field, says academy spokesman David Van Daff. ""Everyone is aware there's an (obesity) crisis, an epidemic,"" he says. ""People are trying a variety of different methods to improve their fitness levels, but they're not achieving success independently. They're recognizing they need a coach, a motivator, who will hold them accountable."" Personal trainers provide clients with programs to achieve their goals, Van Daff says, whether that's weight loss, muscle building or overall fitness. The National Academy of Sports Medicine certification teaches everything from basic anatomy to kinesiology to motivational techniques. Van Daff loves to see people who have lost a significant amount of weight become trainers. ""It's helpful for somebody in this industry if they can relate to their clients from a personal perspective,"" he says. ""If you have a personal trainer who knows what it's like to be 20 or 30 pounds overweight ... it helps in gaining (the client's) confidence."" Steffen passed her certification exam on her way to losing another 30 to 40 pounds. She designated 2012 as the year of running: She ran her first 5K in May and her first half marathon later that year. Toward the end of the year, she finally joined a gym and began to lift weights. ""(I thought) I look good in my clothes, but do I look good naked?"" she says with a laugh. Now she hits the gym five to six days a week to weight train and run. She also has cleaned up her eating habits. Steffen eats six small meals a day that almost always include protein, whether it's chicken, tuna, Greek yogurt or fish. She has a gallon of water on her desk at work. (""I'm constantly going to the bathroom,"" she says.) She's given up French fries and French bread, possibly her two biggest diet downfalls, although she gives herself permission to splurge during one meal a week. All her hard work has paid off. Steffen has lost 85 pounds and inspires others on her blog, CherieRunsThis.com. Moving on . About a year ago, Steffen ran into her old college professor, the one who had called her ""Precious."" She hadn't seen him since her graduation. Like a scene from a movie, Steffen dropped an orange and it rolled across the floor. Her professor picked it up as a million sentences ran through her head. ""I had dreamed of this moment,"" she says. ""I thought I was going to walk into his office and be like, 'Look at me now.'"" Instead she simply said, ""Thank you."" ""If he hadn't said that, none of this would have happened,"" she explains. ""He still has no clue."" For now, Steffen is working as a leasing consultant at an apartment complex. But she's studying to be a fitness nutrition specialist with the National Academy of Sports Medicine and hopes to eventually get enough clients to be a personal trainer full time. She also has her eye on a few bikini competitions, perhaps as a nod to her mother's modeling career. She imagines Hart would flip out if she saw her daughter now, and would immediately want to go shopping. ""She would love that I listened to her and took her advice,"" Steffen says. ""She would be really proud of me because I did it the right way."" Have you lost weight? Share your story on iReport.","Cherie Hart Steffen walked off nearly 80 pounds on her home treadmill .

"(CNN) -- There wasn't much drama in Serena Williams' opening match at the French Open this year. She'll take it. Last season at Roland Garros, Frenchwoman Virginie Razzano handed Williams her first loss in the first round of a grand slam tournament -- and Williams has been playing majors for a while, since 1999. Williams, uncharacteristically, blew a one-set lead as well as a sizable advantage in the second-set tiebreak before appearing to cry in her chair. Razzano, cramping, withstood a late rally from Williams in the third set to extend the current No. 1's struggles at the French Open, the lone grand slam the American hasn't won more than once. On Sunday as this year's tournament began, Williams cruised past Georgia's Anna Tatishvili 6-0, 6-1 to extend her winning streak to 25 matches. ""It hasn't been working out for me,"" said Williams, referring to her past performances at the French Open. ""I just think I may have gotten nervous in the past or may have basically choked a few matches away. ""Some matches I just lost because maybe I wasn't intense enough or maybe I didn't do enough work before I got here to the tournament."" Williams won over the crowd on center court by practicing her French, but most at Roland Garros will likely be rooting for her next opponent, Caroline Garcia, since she's French. Garcia once led Maria Sharapova, the reigning French Open champion, by a set and break at the tournament. The player Sharapova beat in last year's final, Sara Errani, also eased into the second round. The Italian downed slumping Dutchwoman Arantxa Rus 6-1, 6-2. In men's action Roger Federer -- the French Open is the lone grand slam he hasn't won more than once -- disposed of Spanish qualifier Pablo Carreno Busta 6-2, 6-2, 6-3. Federer, the owner of a men's record 17 majors, made it look easy against Carreno Busta, who won seven straight tournaments at the lower level this season. ""I felt good,"" said Federer. ""He's played many matches and won a lot this year - a lot on clay, by comparison with me. I knew it could be tricky if I didn't sustain a certain aggressiveness, get caught up in long rallies, maybe what he's looking for. ""I did well on the serve, on the return, on movement. Clearly I'm very pleased. Am I a favorite to win here? I don't care, because it doesn't give me any more opportunities to win the tournament. I just want to remain calm and let the storm go by."" Federer seemed to catch a break in the draw when he was put in the same half as fourth-seed David Ferrer and not seven-time tournament winner Rafael Nadal, the third seed. Ferrer, never into a grand slam final, recorded a straight-set win over Australian Marinko Matosevic. Matosevic's veteran countryman, Lleyton Hewitt, took part in the day's most dramatic match, blowing a two-set lead and falling to Gilles Simon 3-6, 1-6, 6-4, 6-1, 7-5. Simon originally held a 5-0 lead in the fifth. Hewitt, who lost his fourth straight encounter, continues to compete, despite hip problems. ""Physically I feel good. I was never going to play a lot of clay tournaments anyway,"" the 32-year-old former Wimbledon champion said. ""I wanted to be fresh physically and mentally for the grass season. I still trained extremely hard, though, so that was good. Now we will see what happens on the grass.""

"Sydney (CNN) -- When winter hits, Sydney becomes something of a ghost town as its 4 million or so residents retreat indoors to acclimatize to the cold. Yet for the past five years, they've been beckoned outside by Vivid Sydney, an 18-day festival of light, music and ideas that takes over after dark May 24 to June 10. At the core of the carbon-neutral festival is Vivid Light. From 6 p.m. every evening, local and visiting artists use light installations and 3-D projectors to transform the 1,056,000 tiles of the Sydney Opera House, the Museum of Contemporary Art and other category-killing buildings into giant canvases of color and light. Check out this incredible Sydney Opera House timelapse . Headlining Vivid Live, the festival's ticketed live music program, are German electronic music pioneers Kraftwerk. Other acts included Joy Division and Vangelis from the UK and homegrown acts Cloud Control and Empire of the Sun. Bobby Womack called in sick. Vivid Ideas, the festival's third and final arm, comprises more than 100 lectures, workshops and debates. Led by global leaders in the fields of fashion, film, publishing, architecture and design, it underlines Sydney's standing as a global epicenter for creative arts. ""Vivid now leads the world in sheer number and size of buildings projections -- no other city lights up its famous landmarks and skyscrapers the way we do,"" says creative adviser Ignatius Jones, who co-directed the 2000 Sydney Olympics' opening ceremony. ""This year we're going to have 60 light sculptures -- nearly twice as many as last year. It's going to be really, really big."" A complete list of events and shows, plus ticketing details are accessible here: Vivid Sydney . In sync with the colder clime, Sydneysiders stray from the city's beaches and harbor to find fun in the retail and entertainment precincts of the inner city and beyond. Here are three of the hippest. Insider guide to Sydney . Surry Hills . During the Great Depression, Surry Hills was a Dickensian slum known for brothels and razor-wielding street gangs. But demand for city-fringe housing has seen the suburb embark on a journey of gentrification that transformed it into Sydney's Soho district. Starting at the junctures of Oxford Street, Sydney's celebrated gay district, vintage clothing stores like Grandma Takes a Trip, Wheels & Dollbaby and Strawberry Hills (+612 9380 8809) make Surry Hills Sydney's capital of alternative fashion. For contemporary threads, check out Japanese-Danish boutique Mushu, Via Alley Shop and Gallery and Flight 001, a travel store shaped like the inside of a jumbo jet. New York-style warehouse bars like Toko, The Winery and Shortgrain buzz with life on wintry weekends, while neon green spirits are served with aplomb at The Absinthe Salon. The home of Australia's most innovative theater company, Belvoir Street Theatre is where Hollywood heavyweights Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush cut their teeth. From May 28 to July 14, Belvoir presents ""Angles in America,"" a two-part Pulitzer Prize-winning play featuring Marcus Graham of David Lynch's ""Mulholland Dr."" To get a sense of Surry Hills's working-class past, order a beer on tap or at The Cricketers Arms, Hollywood Hotel or any of the suburb's un-renovated pubs. Adherents of the if-it-isn't-broken-don't fix-it school of design, they are windows into Surry Hill's indissoluble bohemian heart. The Inner West . When it comes to noisy and unsightly motorways, Parramatta Road, Sydney's major east-west artery, takes the cake. But a select number of its side streets and adjoining suburbs are vibrant hubs for food, fashion and art. At the very start of Parramatta Road, the castle-like buildings of Sydney University were modeled on London's Westminster Abbey. Walk though its neogothic sandstone quadrangle to King Street, Newtown, an eclectic meeting place for students, rockabillies and steampunks. Lined with old pubs, cinemas and multicultural eats like Rowda Ya Habibi (+612 9557 5368), Sydney's best kebab joint, King Street is a people-watchers' paradise and then some. Across from Sydney University is Glebe Point Road, home to Gleebooks, Sydney's most popular independent bookstore. On Saturday mornings, Glebe Markets provides a showcase for emerging artists with recycled fashion and bands on the side. A mile west of here on Parramatta Road is Deus ex Machina's House of Simple Pleasures. A hanger-size oasis of retro style, it combines a custom motorcycle showroom, the Deus boutique and a pseudo-industrial function space that hosts everything from weddings to rock concerts. Continue another mile and a half and you'll find Sydney's Little Italy on Norton Street, Leichhardt. With around 50 restaurants and cafÃ©s, the strip stakes a claim as one of Sydney's great ethic culinary hubs. Discover your favorite Leichhardt eatery on a Buon Appetito walking tour. Run by Italian-Australian advocacy group Co.As.It, it visits Leichhardt's best food outlets, teaches the history of Italians in the area and culminates in a cooking demonstration and Sicilian lunch. Woollahra . An Aboriginal word meaning 'camp', Woollahra is one of the eastern Sydney's most affluent suburbs. Its streets are lined with elm trees, grand Victorian terraces and a village-like retail hub home to some of Australia's most prestigious art galleries. The Gallery Walk starts near the corners of Oxford and Queen Street at The Art of Dr Seuss for limited-edition prints by the author of the ""Cat in the Hat"" series. Continue along Queen Street to Bewoulf Gallery for exotic and ethnographic ceramics. A detour through Hallis Lane leads to the Tim Olsen Gallery and Richard Martin Art on Jersey Road, where Sydney's art cognoscenti attend regular exhibitions. Tucked behind rows of square hedges around the corner on Ocean Street is Chiswick, a glasshouse-inspired eatery with shaded outdoor seating. TV chef Matt Moran sources herbs from Chiswick's own vegetable patch, lamb from his own farm and small goods from Victor Churchill, a Woollahra butcher of distinction established in 1876. Back on Queen Street, across the road from luxury perfumery Jo Malone, is Life.Style -- the boutique-gallery hybrid of global cosmetics tsar Napoleon Perdis. Trading from the heritage-listed original Woollahra Post Office building, it stocks IONIA porcelain dinnerware from Greece, Lucite and Perspex accessories from France plus lithographs and garments from the US. ""Woollahra is a micro cosmos that epitomizes the idea of Sydney as a city of villages,"" Perdis says. ""It's not just a tourist attraction, it's the way we live.""","Vivid Sydney is in three parts, Vivid Light, Vivid Music and Vivid Ideas .

"(CNN) -- Federal authorities have arrested a third man they said was linked to the September kidnapping of a Georgia teenager. In a press release Wednesday, the FBI said it arrested 28-year-old Tony Maurice Graves on Friday on a charge of conspiracy to kidnap. The agency said Graves, along with 29-year-old Wildrego Jackson, who was arrested nearly a month ago, were involved in abducting 14-year-old Ayvani Perez on September 17 in Clayton County. Also wanted in connection with Ayvani's abduction was 40-year-old Juan Alberto Contreras-Rodriguez, a Mexican national that authorities busted in a 2012 anti-drug trafficking raid. He is currently being held on immigration-related charges, according to the FBI. According to a federal affidavit, the 36-hour drama began with two armed men demanding money and jewelry from Ayvani's mother. When the mother did not comply, the men took Ayvani, the affidavit said. The same men later returned the girl unharmed to her aunt's house in Conyers, Georgia, the affidavit said. It remains unclear whether the abduction was random. Phone calls abductors made to Ayvani's family demanding ransom and drugs allowed authorities to trace their phone records, which they said led to Jackson's arrest the next day. Authorities have not detailed how the men were arrested.","NEW: A third man is arrested in connection with kidnapping of 14-year-old girl .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Peace negotiators trying to end Colombia's blood-drenched, five-decade old civil war Sunday announced an agreement on land reform between the Colombian government and FARC rebels. The land reform agreement is the first of six points that negotiators need to broker to reach a peace deal. ""It's a historic change, a rebirth of the Colombian countryside which could lead to an end to the conflict,"" said the government's lead negotiator, Humberto de la Calle. Under the agreement, land not being used would be turned over to poor Colombians to cultivate. The government would provide loans and credits to the farmers. Impoverished areas of the countryside would also receive improvements in infrastructure, health care and housing. De la Calle said land that's privately owned would not be affected. ""Urgent changes to the establishment are knocking on the door of the state, demanding citizen participation in political decisions and choices that would guarantee them a future with dignity,"" said FARC lead negotiator Ivan Marquez. Both sides cautioned Sunday that the land agreement would take effect only if an overall peace deal was reached. Government negotiators said that any deal that is struck would have to first be approved by national referendum before being implemented. The land deal was the first major sign of progress after six months of negotiations between the government and rebels in Havana, Cuba. Cuba and Norway are serving as guarantors for the talks, with Chile and Venezuela acting as observers. ""What has happened so far is part of a greater agreement which we hope to accomplish in the coming months,"" said Cuba's representative to the talks, Carlos Fernandez de Cossio. Negotiators still have to tackle the difficult issues of how FARC rebels would disarm and the future of top rebel leaders who have been sentenced to prison for drug trafficking, murder and kidnapping. FARC leaders charge that government forces have illegally executed rebels and allowed right-wing paramilitary groups to carry out massacres. Thousands of Colombians have been killed and millions of others displaced during the civil war. Unusual arrest in Colombia involves fake nuns and cocaine .

"(CNN) -- The last time Arsenal led the English Premier League by as much as five points, it was February 2008. So it's no surprise that Arsene Wenger, whose last silverware came three years before that, is not getting carried away. The veteran manager knows, after all, that a few days is a long time in football. On Tuesday his team lost 2-0 to Chelsea in the League Cup, which many trumpeted as a sign that Jose Mourinho's side had taken the ascendancy and would be the dominant force this season. But on Saturday Mourinho's men crashed 2-0 to Newcastle, which had lost to the EPL's bottom side Sunderland the previous weekend, and Arsenal earned a five-point lead at the top with a comprehensive win by the same score against another title hopeful, Liverpool. Arsenal's pre-season target Luis Suarez and fellow in-form striker Daniel Sturridge barely had a look-in for Liverpool, which had scored 12 goals in the past four games. Santi Cazorla volleyed a 19th-minute opener after his header hit the post, and Aaron Ramsey joined Sturridge on 10 goals in all competitions just before the hour mark when the Wales midfielder was given time to shoot from outside the penalty area. ""I am always confident, but of course there is a long way to go,"" Wenger said. ""Today was an important win for the team. ""It was vital to win, I said that before the game and I don't change my mind, because had we not won people would say 'Yes, Arsenal at home they cannot win the big games.' ""The Chelsea game was an important game but not of the importance of today's game. But still, it was a disappointment and it was important to respond today, to convince people that we can win these big games. ""We had a good solidarity, a good focus, and I believe we have plenty of other big games coming up and this will help us deal well with them."" On Wednesday, the Gunners will travel to Germany to face Borussia Dortmund in a match which will have a big bearing on the London club's hopes of progressing to the knockout stage of the Champions League. ""Who would have said that Chelsea would lose today at Newcastle after Tuesday night? But that's the Premier League and it's down to consistency,"" Wenger said. ""We are consistent since the first of January 2013, with the same group (of players). We have shown since our massive blip against Aston Villa (at the start of this season) that we have been very consistent. We have 10 games, 25 points."" While Wenger appears calm, Mourinho admitted to being worried after the Newcastle defeat left his Chelsea side in second place, above Liverpool on goal difference. ""I'm angry because I don't understand it,"" said the former Real Madrid manager, who won two EPL titles in his first season at the London club. ""Of course I am worried, and I read in previous years it happened the same. ""Chelsea were successful in cup competitions but not successful in the Premier League. Last year in December, they were not in the race for the title because they were already 20 points behind."" Mourinho made nine changes to his team, and complained: ""I made 11 mistakes. I should have picked another 11 and not this one."" While the Portuguese coach's fortunes may have momentarily dipped, those of the Manchester clubs soared this weekend. Defending champion Manchester United won 3-1 at Fulham, the fourth victory in a row in all competitions for under-pressure manager David Moyes -- who saw Antonio Valencia, Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney score in the first half as his side stayed eighth. Manchester City moved up to fourth -- six points behind Arsenal -- with a 7-0 thrashing of third-bottom Norwich, having lost at Chelsea last Sunday. England goalkeeper Joe Hart was dropped following his costly blunder at the end of that match, and his Romanian replacement Costel Pantilimon has now kept two clean sheets following the midweek League Cup win at Newcastle. Sergio Aguero's eighth league goal this season moved the Argentina striker to the top of the scoring charts alongside Sturridge, while Yaya Toure hit his fifth, Alvaro Negredo his fourth and Edin Dzeko his third among seven individual scorers. Stoke goalkeeper Asmir Begovic was also a notable name on the scoresheets after his wind-assisted effort deceived Southampton counterpart Artur Boruc after just 13 seconds. The Bosnia international became the fifth keeper to hit the target since the EPL began in 1992, while Jay Rodriguez's equalizer left Saints in fifth place, behind City on goal difference. ""As a manager that is the first time I've had to experience a moment as unlucky as that,"" said Southampton's Mauricio Pochettino. ""I don't blame him at all. I think it had more to do with the weather conditions. ""He didn't apologize for anything because he didn't have to. The wind was changing gusts completely all the time and it is a ground which is open on three sides, which makes it even more windy."" West Brom moved up to 11th with a 2-0 win that dropped Crystal Palace to the bottom of the table, despite nine-man Sunderland losing 1-0 at 10th-placed Hull. West Ham drew 0-0 with Aston Villa in Saturday's other match.","Arsenal leads EPL by five points after beating title rival Liverpool 2-0 Saturday .

"(CNN) -- Tourists become volunteer rescue workers. The connected provide power outlets and Wi-Fi. Performers lift spirits. Photographers preserve images. Doctors work overtime to keep hospitals running and patients alive. In the wake of Superstorm Sandy, which ripped so much apart, people have come together. For every story of devastation we've seen in the month since Sandy hit, there have been dozens of untold stories of good Samaritans, quietly helping get things back to normal in whatever way they can. Many offered their services in traditional ways -- donating money to relief efforts or helping to rebuild homes on the weekend. Others, though, found unorthodox but equally beneficial ways to help. Here are just a few of those stories: . Going on with the show . The day after Sandy hit, New York actor Jacob Brent thought about what he and his fellow performers could do for the city. Broadway shows had been canceled, but Brent, who played Mr. Mistoffelees in ""Cats,"" had the idea to do a little singing and dancing anyway. So he got a message out to the theater community via Twitter: . ""There is a lot of devastation in our beloved city and for some reason we here in Midtown have been spared,"" it read. ""I just walked over to Times Square and people are looking for something to do. I think we should all get together and sing some songs for these people. ...It's not much but its a little something we can do for the city."" Dozens of Broadway performers, along with residents and tourists, gathered at the heart of Times Square for the event. The impromptu concert included classic show tunes such as ""There's No Business Like Show Business,"" ""My Favorite Things"" and ""New York, New York,"" and collected donations for the Red Cross. Among the attendees was theater critic and student Sarah Taylor Ellis, who called it ""a total delight"" and shared several photos on CNN iReport. ""Everyone was so glad to get out of their apartments and gather for a communal activity,"" she said. ""The tourists and residents alike were enjoying the unexpected musical entertainment, especially since Broadway shows have been canceled the past three days."" Afterward, Brent shared his feelings about the performance on Twitter: ""We lifted our voices and lifted the spirit of New York,"" he wrote. ""I am overwhelmed."" Hey New York, what's up with the niceness? Salvaging a lifetime of memories . Photographer Limor Garfinkle walked through the hard-hit coastal Staten Island neighborhood of South Beach the weekend after Sandy made landfall, wondering how she could help. Everywhere she looked, she saw photo albums in the debris. She knew she couldn't replace the moments on film now sitting in piles of garbage, corroded with seawater. But perhaps she could help them make new memories. She gave her card to several families and offered them free photo sessions when they were ready. Then she found Victoria Beckman, a Russian immigrant laying out family photographs and documents in the cold air along the two stone railings leading from her front door to the sidewalk. Inside, she had thousands more damaged photos to go through. Her home had flooded with 6 feet of water. It was the perfect opportunity to help. Beckman and Garfinkle, who is from Israel, spoke easily in Hebrew. ""She told me they were all ruined, they were all gone, and I said to her, 'Let me try to save them,' "" Garfinkle recalled. ""It's almost a guilt you feel -- I have a warm home and somebody else doesn't, and you just have to help. I knew it wasn't going to be easy ... And it wasn't."" Finding joy among the wreckage . Garfinkle, a family photographer and an art director for a Midtown advertising agency, took garbage bags stuffed with a lifetime of memories, including pictures from her childhood, professional photos a relative had taken and expensive albums from her son's wedding in Israel last year. She researched photo restoration techniques on the Internet and spent weeks rinsing the muck-covered images and album pages under cold water and laying them to dry on paper towels. Beckman, who is living without heat in her gutted home, asked Garfinkle to keep the photos until she has a spot to put them. ""These are pictures from all my life, my children, and I am very appreciative of her help,"" Beckman said. And Garfinkle's offer of free photo sessions to families affected by Sandy still stands. She can be reached through her website, 4mothersphoto.com. Putting life's problems in perspective . For weeks, advertising photographer Carlos Chiossone sought out personal stories among the devastation left by Superstorm Sandy. ""There are plenty of volunteers, so as a photographer I decided to simply get their stories out to try to get more help for them,"" he explained. Chiossone said the conversations helped put his life into perspective. ""As I interviewed some of the people affected and companies trying to come back to life, I realized how each individual makes their own problem the biggest one of the moment. Part of my motivation was to show how easy we had it,"" he said. ""Four days without power or showering is not a big deal. Losing your house is another story."" He spoke to several residents of Staten Island, New York, including Janice Kennedy, whose house at New Dorp Beach was leveled by the storm even she was one of the few people on her street to board up her home. Kennedy told her story on camera and showed Chiossone what little remained of her property. Kennedy's emotions were raw as she described what it's like to face starting your life over. ""My husband died three years ago, we were hit with Irene last year, and now this. I've gotta leave. I'm done,"" she said, her voice shaking. ""We've lost everything. I got married in this house. My son grew up in this house. There's nothing left."" Weeks later, Chiossone has been unable to reach Kennedy but is eager to follow up with her. In the meantime, he continues to document life in New Dorp Beach, and sees hope. ""What was chaos almost a month ago here in New Dorp Beach now has gained a little sense of normalcy."" he said. Trying to keep the family business afloat after Sandy . 'Spitting rhymes' for Sandy relief . The storm flooded Eduardo Ramos' apartment on Avenue C in Manhattan, but he feels lucky. He and his roommates had time to save all their belongings as the water was coming in, and his roommate's family welcomed him to stay in their home on the Upper East Side. It only felt right to do what he could to help others not so fortunate. In the weeks after Sandy, he and his friend CJ Richards -- both professional models, actors and rappers -- joined the Rockaway Beach Surf Club's relief efforts in the Queens beach community. In between jobs and castings they went to Queens to knock on doors, assess needs and help families remove moldy furniture. They wanted to find a way to help on the days they couldn't physically be in Queens, which led them to rapping for victims. The friends, who had recently begun performing freestyle hip-hop on the streets for fun, set up their amp and microphone and performed raps on demand for $1, with the money going to Sandy relief efforts. ""One time a girl said 'rap about my friend's jeans,' we just started going off on that. At Astor Place, a couple was from York in the UK, and we started rapping about London ... You just kind of let your mind go,"" Ramos explained. So far they've rapped in Times Square, the Meatpacking District and Astor Place in Lower Manhattan, where iReporter and friend Chris Luna found them and recorded a video. In three stints, the friends have raised $200 for the victims, including one generous $100 donation from a hip-hop fan who was impressed with their rhyming skills and asked to join in. They plan to hit the streets again this weekend and will give the money to the surf club to buy socks, blankets and other needed supplies. ""I feel like they're going to need more help as people start to forget and life continues as usual,"" Ramos said. 'Hard-wired to tell stories' Arriving by bus, train and plane, thousands of Mormons from across the country canceled their church plans one Sunday to help with Sandy relief. One of those volunteers, Joshua Brown, documented the day on video. The Manhattan wedding photographer heard stories of loss, devastation and even some of hope from the people of Rockaway, New York. ""We lost everything, but with people like you, we know everything's going to be alright and we have faith in God,"" said one woman who choked back tears as he interviewed her. Days earlier, Brown joined Mormons Helping Hands. His job was ripping out dry wall from waterlogged homes. As he worked, he saw a ""huge need"" for more volunteers to help the community rebuild. The next time he went back to Rockaway -- that Sunday -- he brought his camera along to help get the word out. ""The day I was shooting the video, I felt a little guilty being there. Some of my friends were there doing really intense, back-breaking work,"" he said. ""But by making the video, I felt I could persuade more people to get out there, which was the best thing I could do with my talents."" He accomplished his goal. Between Vimeo and CNN iReport, his video received about 270,000 views. ""I'm hard-wired to tell stories,"" he said. ""I thought that this was the best tool to get more people."" Although he got his message across, Brown still worries. ""People were already putting this in the rear view, and that was just two weeks after (the storm),"" he said. ""Now it's been a month ... and there's still so much more to be done out there, so I'm hoping that it won't fade away."" CNN's Daphne Sashin, Rachel Rodriguez, Henry Hanks, Christina Zdanowicz and Katie Hawkins-Gaar contributed to this story.","One month after Superstorm Sandy's landfall, stories of good Samaritans emerge .

"(CNN) -- Three women who were rescued this month after being held captive in a Cleveland house for close to a decade ""are happy and safe,"" and overwhelmed by the public's support, their attorneys said in a statement released Wednesday. Amanda Berry, Michelle Knight and Georgina ""Gina"" DeJesus ""want you to know they're doing well,"" the attorneys' statement reads. ""They are happy and safe and continue to heal, a process that requires time and privacy,"" attorneys Kathy Joseph, Heather Kimmel, Henry Hilow and James Wooley said. Berry, 27; DeJesus, 23; and Knight, 32 -- and a 6-year-old daughter born to Berry in captivity -- were found alive on May 6 in a Cleveland home, police said. The women are believed to have been abducted years ago -- in 2002, 2003 and 2004 -- and held captive at the home of Ariel Castro, 52, according to police. 'Please don't let me go,' Cleveland kidnap victim told officers . Castro was charged with kidnapping and rape after Berry escaped from the home with the aid of neighbors, authorities said. The attorneys said that the outpouring of public support -- including donations to the Cleveland Courage Fund, which the lawyers say will be used to establish trusts to aid the three women and Berry's daughter -- ""has been nothing short of remarkable."" Source: Michelle Knight was Cleveland suspect's main 'punching bag' ""To have complete strangers offer loving support in the form of money, goods and services, reaching out to help like a family member, is appreciated in ways that are impossible to put into words,"" the lawyers said.

"(CNN) -- Not content with having the world's best player, Lionel Messi, on their books, Barcelona have moved to sign Pele's ""modern successor"" -- Neymar. A day after Bayern Munich beat Borussia Dortmund 2-1 in the Champions League final at Wembley to be crowned Kings of Europe, it was announced that the much coveted Brazilian striker would join Barcelona for five years. The transfer fee wasn't disclosed, but one Brazilian newspaper said the buyout clause surpassed $80 million. The move, on paper, should boost a Barcelona side that features an ageing Xavi, Andres Iniesta and Carles Puyol, three club stalwarts. Midfielder Cesc Fabregas and forward Alexis Sanchez have struggled, many would say, since joining from Arsenal and Udinese, respectively. Barcelona might have won the Spanish league title, but it was crushed by Bayern Munich in the Champions League semifinals. The defeat stung. Some labeled Barcelona a one-man team after losing 7-0 on aggregate, referring to four-time world player of the year Messi. Messi was inhibited by a hamstring injury in the first leg and didn't play at all in the second. Without him, Barcelona offered little resistance. Pele, considered one of the greatest football players of all time, said last year that Neymar -- his fellow Brazilian -- was even better than Messi, an Argentinean. Barcelona lavished praise on Neymar, too. ""The player is known for his exquisite technical skills, which makes this free-scoring striker a nightmare for any defense,"" Barcelona said on its Web site. ""His style is beautiful to watch and he has received recognition and praise from the legendary Pele himself, of whom many believe he is the modern successor."" Neymar, the current South American player of the year, revitalized Santos, Pele's former club, scoring 138 goals in only 229 matches. He helped Santos win the 2011 Copa Libertadores and the 2010 Brazilian Cup. With Neymar expected to move on when his contract was due to expire next year, a transfer to Europe was widely anticipated. He had been previously linked with Barcelona, as well as Chelsea and Real Madrid, among other clubs. Last week Santos said it had accepted offers from two teams. At 21, he is an established international with Brazil and will be counted on to lead the nation in next year's World Cup on home soil, although he has also drawn criticism from Pele for some of his outings. Neymar struggled in the 2012 Olympic final against Mexico. Fellow Brazilian international Thiago Silva defended him. ""Our biggest star nowadays is Neymar and I think people have to have a little bit more respect with the professional that is Ney,"" he told CNN. ""He's a great guy with a very pure and good heart and people sometimes make things up and start talking rubbish where there's nothing to talk about. ""I would like to ask for people to have a bit more patience with him because he's our biggest star at the moment."" Neymar's last game for Santos comes Sunday against Flamengo as the Brazilian season's opening weekend began. ""My feelings for the club and the fans will never change,"" Neymar said. ""I made it sure that I play (the last match) so I can have the opportunity to once again enter the field wearing the team's jersey and to hear the (fans) chant my name. ""Only a club like Santos FC could give me everything I have experienced on and off the field. I thank the wonderful fans who supported me even in the most difficult moments. Titles, goals, dribbling, celebrations and songs that fans created for me will be forever in my heart."" Neymar wasn't only a success on the pitch in Brazil. He earns a reported $20 million a year in salary and endorsements, and he was recently named SportsPro's most marketable athlete for a second consecutive time.

"(CNN) -- With a daring move in the last few laps, Tony Kanaan of Brazil passed American Ryan Hunter-Reay and won the 97th Indianapolis 500 under a yellow caution flag. It was the second of two caution flags precipitated by crashes in the final eight laps of the 200-lap, 500-mile race at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. ""I got a little bit of luck today,"" Kanaan said in a post-race interview. The race featured a record 14 leaders and 68 lead changes, with Kanaan making the last one between the two caution flags. No driver is allowed to pass another car while the caution flag is posted, so at that point, to win, all Kanaan needed to do was finish without crashing. Despite the yellow flags, the average speed was 187.433 mph, setting another Indy 500 record. Kanaan was a sentimental favorite after several near-misses in his 11 previous Indy 500s. Throngs gathered around him as he drank the winner's traditional bottle of milk and later kissed the Speedway's bricks. Rookie Carlos Munoz of Colombia finished second, Hunter-Reay finished third and Marco Andretti placed fourth. Each of the top four finishers was driving a Chevrolet. Ed Carpenter -- the stepson of Tony George, the founder of the IndyCar racing series -- sat in the advantageous pole position at the front of the field at the start of the race. He finished 10th.","Brazilian Tony Kanaan wins Indy 500 in final laps .

"Kathmandu (CNN) -- A fight for supremacy between two octogenarian climbers is heating up on the slopes of the world's highest mountain. Eighty-year-old Japanese national Yuichiro Miura is on his way home after becoming the oldest climber to reach the summit of Everest on Thursday. But his achievement may soon be overshadowed as his old rival, veteran Nepali climber Min Bahadur Sherchan, 81, acclimatizes at base camp, ready to reclaim his title. The two mountaineers first clashed in 2008, when Sherchan, then 76, reached the 29,028-foot (8,848-meter) peak a day before Miura, then 75. However, it was Miura's ascent that made it into Guinness World Records, forcing Sherchan to travel to London to set the record straight. Back in Nepal, he gathered paperwork, photos, witness accounts and media reports to confirm his ascent, and his feat finally entered the record books in 2010. Sherchan dismissed talk that he was making the climb because he was in danger of losing his record. He said he had planned to reach the summit last year but failed to secure financial support. ""Why should I go to set a record? I have my own record. I wanted to climb Everest in my eighth decade,"" he said before he left for base camp. Oldest Everest climber finally gets recognition . Mountaineering officials in Nepal said the government had waived a permit fee of $10,000 and given him about $11,200 to fund his ascent. This year marks the 60th anniversary of the first expedition to reach the summit of Everest: Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay made it to the top of the mountain on May 29, 1953. Before he boarded his flight at Kathmandu airport on Sunday, Miura said he had scaled Everest for the last time. ""I think three times is enough,"" said Miura, who made his first ascent at the age of 70. ""At this point I could not think of anything but rest."" He wished Sherchan good luck but called on his rival to take a photograph as evidence of a successful climb. Known for his exploits an extreme skier, Miura made the ascent with his son Gota. Sherchan's wife, however, was less than thrilled by her husband's late-in-life mountaineering. ""Of course I do not want him to go,"" Purna Kumari Sherchan said. ""I had told him not to go even the first time."" The traffic jam on the roof of the world . Sherchan is being assisted in his ascent by a Sherpa who has climbed Everest 12 times. To prepare, Sherchan carried a 25-kilogram (55-pound) load on his back while walking up and down the stairs of his three-story Kathmandu home several times a day. ""If I am unsuccessful, it will be because of the weather. It will not be because of my physical condition,"" Sherchan said. Journalist Manesh Shrestha reported from Katmandu. Journalist Katie Hunt reported and wrote from Hong Kong.","Japan's Yuichiro Miura, 80, is on way home after becoming the oldest climber to scale Everest .

"(CNN) -- Protesters filled Paris' Esplanade des Invalides on Sunday, rallying against a new law that will allow same-sex marriage in France starting Wednesday. Paris police estimate 150,000 demonstrators marched along three different routes before converging in the sprawling plaza along the Seine River. The arguments against same-sex marriage in France sound similar to those expressed in other countries, with many opponents saying they're for more civil rights, but against homosexuals officially getting married. Other protesters called themselves ""a defender of the family,"" or said they ""are not homophobic, (but) just want to protect children."" CNN's French affiliate BFM said 4,500 police were deployed Sunday to keep the peace after extremist threats, but the event proved to be calm. On May 18, French President Francois Hollande signed into law a bill allowing same-sex couples to marry and adopt. The signing came a day after France's top court, the Constitutional Council, ruled that the bill adheres to the constitution. France is the ninth country in Europe to allow same-sex marriage. If pending legislation in New Zealand and Uruguay is enacted as expected this year, the worldwide total of countries with legalized same-sex marriage will rise to 14.

"(CNN) -- After the tea party's poor showing in the 2012 elections, many in the political world declared the movement dead. After all, it had lost one-sixth of its members in Congress and at least two Senate seats by running questionable candidates. Plus, the tea party didn't get its way on the debt ceiling, and the Paul Ryan budget failed to get much traction. Recent CNN polls, however, suggest that gaffes by the Obama administration are breathing new life into the tea party movement. In a CNN poll conducted in March, 28% of the voting-age public supported the tea party. Now, however, in the wake of the recent controversies involving the administration -- especially the one about the Internal Revenue Service -- support is on the rise. According to a CNN poll released May 20, 37% of the public now supports the movement, a level that approaches the high-water mark the tea party achieved in 2010. Why the increase in popularity? It's simple: The IRS scandal resonates with the tea party faithful because it fits so well the meme the movement has pushed since the early days of the administration: An Obama-led government is too big, too fiscally irresponsible. First, there was the movement's resistance to the stimulus package, claiming the government spent too much to revive the economy. Then, of course, was the tea party's opposition to health care reform: Again, government had grown too big, spending excessively. And that some people would be forced by the government to purchase insurance or else face a tax, for tea partiers, was further proof of Obama-led governmental tyranny. Now, the IRS scandal permits the tea party to highlight how the administration is overreaching and meddling in the lives of Americans. But here's the thing: Most political scandals don't last very long. Those involving the president, or officials in his administration, tend to have a shelf life of six months. As it stands, we're not even six months beyond the most recent election cycle. So the likelihood that the tea party -- and therefore Republicans -- can leverage the recent scandals to their political advantage isn't great if the next election cycle (2014) is the target. If the tea party and Republicans wish to make political hay that will carry them through 2014, they must return their gaze to the substantive policy issues that tend to mobilize their supporters: Immigration reform and same-sex marriage are two examples. Indeed, opposition to immigrant rights and same-sex rights has proven effective for rallying the base. The problem is that if the tea party returns to issues proven to fire up the base it will violate at least two of its major tenets: fiscal prudence and smaller government. For instance, the tea party's position on immigration reform would increase government spending to the tune of $28 billion per year to secure the border. In the case of same-sex rights, the state is called upon to regulate marriage. This would seem to contradict the tea party's claim that it's all about fiscal prudence and small government. How can this be? In other words, how can the tea party and its supporters favor small and large government? The paradox is easily resolved once we consider the motives of many tea party supporters. They see America changing too rapidly, both demographically and culturally. American identity is generally identified as white and heterosexual, among other things. Thus, it shouldn't come as a shock that despite their declared preference for small government, many in the tea party embrace big government when necessary. It's perhaps the most effective way to police what they perceive as encroachments upon the ""American"" way of life in which white racial identity and heterosexuality remain the norm. Like American reactionary movements of the past, the tea party resists change of any kind. For tea party loyalists, the long and short of it is as follows. In President Barack Obama's first term, the government spent too much; so far, in his second, the government is meddling too much. The problem for the tea party is that the benefits extracted from these missteps will likely be short-lived, certainly not enough to last until the next election cycle. Isn't it ironic that to sustain support through 2014, and to have a shot at the White House, the tea party will have to push policy solutions to important issues that rely upon bigger -- not smaller -- government? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Christopher S. Parker.","Christopher Parker: Recent administration controversies have boosted tea party in polls .

"(CNN) -- Andy Johns, the engineer and producer who worked on albums by Led Zeppelin, the Rolling Stones, Television and Van Halen, has died, according to guitarist Stacey Blades, who was collaborating on a project with him. Johns, who died Sunday, was 61. Blades noted that Johns had entered the hospital about 10 days ago. ""Andy's health wasn't all that great over the last six months or so, but he was still Andy,"" he told CNN. ""When I got the call yesterday I was shocked."" Johns, the younger brother of famed producer Glyn Johns, was the engineer for most of Led Zeppelin's output, including ""Led Zeppelin II,"" ""Led Zeppelin IV,"" ""Houses of the Holy"" and ""Physical Graffiti."" He was known for his skill at recording a range of guitar sounds and, especially, John Bonham's room-shaking drums. He also had a hand in the Rolling Stones' ""Sticky Fingers,"" ""Exile on Main Street"" and ""Goats Head Soup,"" Van Halen's ""For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge"" (which he produced) and two albums by guitarist Joe Satriani. ""Lovely guy -- patient, skilled, funny, encouraging, sharp ... all the qualities you want in someone who is getting your music on to tape,"" wrote Queen's Brian May on his website. Queen recorded at London's Olympic Studios, where Johns also worked. ""1 of the great engineer/producers of our time,"" tweeted guitarist Slash. Johns also co-produced New York punk band Television's seminal ""Marquee Moon,"" though the result wasn't quite what the band was looking for. Johns went for a booming drum sound with the sharper-edged New Yorkers, but it didn't fit, Television's Richard Lloyd told CNN in 2003. ""If the drums were that big, it wouldn't be us,"" Lloyd said. Johns did, however, grab Television's wiry, entangled guitar sound -- which Lloyd described as ""two gears in a clock"" -- perfectly. The album, like many of Johns' recordings, has since become a classic. Johns' more recent recordings included albums by the Steve Miller Band, Chickenfoot and Sabyrtooth. Blades, a former member of L.A. Guns, called Johns ""amazing."" ""It was just amazing to watch him work, and how he would place mics in the recording room, and his ideas while you're tracking. I learned a lot from him, he was inspiring and taught me so much about sound and thinking outside of the box,"" he said. ""You always took his suggestions, because how can you argue with a guy who produced the Stones?"" Blades and other musicians who have worked with Johns are organizing a memorial concert for him next month. The producer and engineer leaves behind a wife and two children.

"Tegucigalpa, Honduras (CNN) -- Honduras, the country with the world's highest murder rate, is backing talks between its two most violent gangs in search of a truce. The Mara Salvatrucha and Calle 18 gangs gave separate statements from a prison in San Pedro Sula on Tuesday, asking forgiveness from the public for the violence and declaring a cease-fire. Gang members spoke with their faces covered with bandanas to disguise their identities as they pushed for peace. ""We are going to start now. ... We have now spent more than a decade being always involved in crime and mistreatment, which has also affected us, and what we want is peace,"" a representative of the Calle 18 gang told reporters. But a deal between the long-warring gangs isn't yet on the table. ""We cannot have a truce with other people who do not think like we do,"" a representative of the Mara Salvatrucha said from the prison inside a city that has been described as the world's murder capital. ""We are going to respect their territory, but let them also respect our territory, so that the violence decreases,"" a Calle 18 representative said. The gangs already reached a truce in neighboring El Salvador, and officials there claim the murder rate has dropped dramatically. Honduran leaders hope for the same. Gang members who spoke from the prison on Tuesday said they wanted the government to help them find work. ""They want to reconcile with Honduran society and ask for forgiveness from the Honduran people, and I think it is a step forward,"" said San Pedro Sula Bishop Romulo Emiliani, who first revealed the talks a week ago. ""What is coming is difficult. It is not easy. It is complicated."" But despite the difficulties of negotiations, Emiliani told the Honduran newspaper La Prensa that down the line, ""depending on certain factors, there may be a truce between the two gangs."" On Monday, Honduran President Porfirio Lobo gave the government's backing. Lobo said he called Emiliani to ""express my congratulations and my appreciation in name of the people of Honduras."" The Organization of American States, through Secretary for Multidimensional Security Adam Blackwell, is also participating in the process. ""We have talked to my knowledge for the past eight months, trying to find the same type of reaction as we have in El Salvador,"" Blackwell said Tuesday. According to the United Nations, in 2011, Honduras had the highest murder rate in the world, at 91.6 killings per 100,000 people. That same year, El Salvador registered the second-highest murder rate, at 69.2 killings per 100,000. These most recent statistics from the United Nations do not reflect the impact of the gang truce in El Salvador, but officials there say it is significant. According the Salvadoran government, the number of murders has fallen by 52% since the truce was signed 14 months ago. The average number of killings fell from 13 per day to 6 per day. According to a U.S. State Department travel warning, however, the truce has had little impact on robbery, assaults and other violent crime.

"(CNN) -- A man is accused of breaking into an Anchorage, Alaska, home over the weekend, sexually assaulting an elderly woman, killing her and her husband, and sexually assaulting the couple's 2-year-old great-granddaughter before fleeing the scene in his boxer shorts. Jerry Andrew Active, 24, was arrested about a block from the home. He was charged with first and second degree murder, sexual assault and burglary, said Anchorage Police Sgt. Slawomir Markiewicz. Active is being held on $1.5 million bond. Markiewicz said police were called to the home shortly before 8 p.m. Saturday. When they arrived, they found Touch Chea, 71, and his wife, Sorn Sreap, 73, dead, apparently due to blunt force trauma to the head and face, Markiewicz said. Autopsies are pending. Police also found in the home the couple's great-granddaughter, who was sexually assaulted. Sreap had also been sexually assaulted, police said. ""I've been in the homicide unit for the last eight years and it's certainly one of the worst homicides we've seen in our town, in our city,"" Markiewicz told CNN's Brooke Baldwin Monday night. The sergeant said the 2-year-old's father told police that he and his wife, who is pregnant, lived in the home with their children -- ages 4 and 2 -- along with Chea, Sreap and another relative. They took their 4-year-old to the movies on Saturday, leaving their youngest in the care of the child's great-grandparents. When they returned, the front door was locked and there was a chain on from the inside, blocking their way. The father was able to open the door a few inches and saw the bodies of Chea and Sreap on the floor. He broke a window, ran inside, yelled for someone to call 911, and found the suspect naked with his 2-year-old, according to Markiewicz. A fight ensued, but police said Active pulled on his boxer shorts and escaped, albeit briefly. A 91-year-old relative, suffering from dementia, was also at home at the time of the attack. She was uninjured. The 2-year-old was taken to a medical facility that specializes in the treatment of sexual abuse. She underwent surgery for her injuries, Markiewicz said. Police believe the attack was random and that Active did not know the victims. Active had previously been convicted of sexual assault that involved an 11-year-old child, Markiewicz said. It was not immediately clear whether Active had retained an attorney.","Jerry Andrew Active, 24, is being held on $1.5 million bond .

"New York (CNN) -- On Memorial Day, we honor those patriots who gave ""the last full measure of devotion"" -- in Abraham Lincoln's words -- and died defending our freedom and union. But this Memorial Day is partly clouded by the resurgence of partisan scandal in Washington. At the IRS, employees filtered through the exploding number of tax exemption applications by politically associated organizations by being on the lookout for groups that had the name ""Tea Party"" and ""Patriot"" in their name. This was improper, illegal, unethical and outrageous. But hold on -- when did the word ""patriot"" become a partisan pejorative? How did such a bipartisan positive word get identified as a sign of hyperpartisan politics? It's actually an interesting story. Over the past few years, you might have noticed more than few political fundraising e-mails addressing you as ""Fellow Patriot."" They ain't from the ACLU. They tend to be from conservative activist groups, and there is more than a little self-congratulation in their tribal identifier. The idea, of course, is that their fellow travelers on the right side of the aisle are the ""real"" patriots -- related to Sarah Palin's ""Real Americans"" -- defenders of a political faith and traditional way of life under attack by liberals, Democrats, demographics and above all, President Barack Obama. The fact that many of these self-styled superpatriots seem to hate their twice-elected president is itself a sign of just how dumb the false dualities that dominate our politics can be. But it's nothing new. Like so many themes in our politics, there are echoes of the past in our present debates. Going back to at least the virulently anti-Catholic ""Know-Nothing"" Party of the 1800s, conservative populists have always styled themselves as superpatriots whose commitment to our country outpaces their neighbors and especially our country's newest arrivals. There has always been an anxiety -- most recently articulated by Pat Buchanan and Anne Coulter -- that immigration will change the complexion and cultural character of our country. It has always been ultimately exposed as xenophobia poising as patriotism. Three of my grandparents arrived to the United States more or less a century ago from Southern Europe, and they were derided as ""garlic eaters"" and far worse by some earlier immigrants, but welcomed with open arms by many more. Their achievement of the American Dream is why I proudly count myself as an almost cheesy patriot of the Norman Rockwell variety. But history teaches us to be wary of people who lord their patriotism over others and use it to divide rather than unite. The precursors to some of today's more cultish conservative groups emerged during post-war anxiety about the legitimate threat of communism and the McCarthy-ite excesses that flowed out of that era's right wing politics. The us-against-them, ""enemy within"" rhetoric of the John Birch Society endures today in the polemics of Glenn Beck, Alex Jones and others. The early growth of self-styled paramilitary groups began in the early 1960s during the presidency of John F. Kennedy -- a committed Cold Warrior, but not incidentally a Catholic and a Democrat. The ""Minutemen"" were one such group who thrived off survivalist drills and a supposed plan to ""confiscate all private firearms by the end of 1965."" We hear similar strains of fearmongering today in the attempts to block the universal gun background check bill. Notably, the Minutemen's founder, Robert Bolivar DePugh, briefly tried to form a political party called -- you guessed it -- The Patriot Party. They fell into some discredit when DePugh's followers were implicated in a half-baked plot to attack the United Nations. At the time, former President Dwight Eisenhower, a Republican, felt compelled to weigh in by saying, ""I don't think the United States needs Super-Patriots. ... We need patriotism, honestly practiced by all of us and we don't need these people [who pretend to be] more patriotic than you or anybody else."" Ike's advice was good then and now. He had the credibility that comes from leading our troops in World War II. Nobody with half a brain was going to accuse him of being anything less than a full-fledged patriot (which didn't stop the founder of the John Birch Society from accusing him of being a Soviet agent just as Obama is called a Muslim Marxist by some today.) Over the past decade, we've seen the explosive growth of paramilitary style ""patriot"" groups -- to more than 1,000 according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. This dynamic definitely didn't help the word ""patriot"" recover its bipartisan bona fides. Neither did the impulse of some on the far left since the late 1960s to denigrate patriotism and military service as signs of what they call American imperialism. The fact that the word ""patriot"" was used as a filter by IRS workers is a sign of the persistence of culture wars in our politics, perhaps more prevalent now than ever because of the rise of partisan media. It is a deep breach of the trust that the IRS has struggled to rebuild since the audit scandals of the Nixon administration. And it is a particular irony that the completely inappropriate partisan filter they used will no doubt actually impede investigations of what might ultimately be revealed to be a more widespread scandal -- the illegal abuse of tax-free status by partisan political groups. But the damage has been done. When the word ""patriot"" becomes a pejorative, it is a sign of how much our shared civic faith has been denigrated by the rise of hyperpartisan politics. The very emotion that should unite us all as Americans is too often used as a wedge to divide us. On this Memorial Day, that's worth reflection and a determination to do better as one small way of honoring those whose sacrifice makes all our bitter political battles seem small and self-indulgent. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","John Avlon: It's telling and sad that IRS workers were on lookout for ""patriot"" groups .

"(CNN) -- Syria's president made a rare public appearance Wednesday. Bashar al-Assad visited the Umawyeen Electricity Station at Tishreen Park in Damascus to commemorate Workers' Day. He congratulated the station's staff and all other Syrian workers. The visit came amid more violence in the civil war, a 2-year-old conflict fueled by a grass-roots revolt against the government. At least 50 people were killed Wednesday, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. The opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said regime aircraft bombarded targets in the Damascus countryside and Aleppo province. The group said an improvised explosive device detonated near a police headquarters in Damascus, injuring a number of people, including children. A giant plume of thick, gray smoke rose over central Damascus, hanging over the skyline. It was not immediately known if there were any fatalities. According to the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency, four people, including a 10-year-old child, were killed, and more than two dozen wounded in a series of bomb blasts in Damascus . Two of the explosive devices were planted on bicycles, SANA said, blaming the violence on terrorists. Hezbollah and Syria . Hezbollah has threatened to intervene further in Syria if there is any threat that the regime could fall to the United States, Israel or extremists, the Lebanese militant group said. The radical Shiite group, which the United States and Israel call a terrorist organization, has said it is in Syria only to protect Lebanese in the country and to protect holy Shiite shrines from the warfare. But reports emerged months ago that Hezbollah fighters are battling Syrian rebels near the Lebanese border. On Tuesday, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said the group could step up its presence in Syria and issued an ominous warning to opposition members backed by foreigners who may try to overthrow al-Assad's regime. ""Syria has real friends in the region and the world. And they will never allow Syria to fall to the hands of the United States, Israel or extremist groups. They will never allow it. You may ask how will this happen. The details will come later,"" Nasrallah said. Sectarian strife has been a factor in the civil strife. The majority of the country is Sunni Muslim; al-Assad's family is Alawite, an offshoot of Shiite Islam. The Hezbollah leader expressed concern that some Sunni extremists may try to destroy holy Shiite shrines in Syria. While such shrines are highly revered by Shiites, a number of Sunni radicals believe they amount to sacrilege. One of the most notable shrines is the Sayida Zeinab, which Shiites believe houses the tomb of the Prophet Mohammed's granddaughter, Zeinab. It's located about 10 kilometers (6 miles) south of the Syrian capital. ""Some extremist groups plan to execute their threats with regards to (Sayida Zeinab), and if such a crime were to take place, it will carry with it grave consequences,"" Nasrallah said. But the Syrian National Coalition, an umbrella opposition group, dismissed the Hezbollah leader's claims. ""Only the Syrians are responsible to defend and protect their cities and their holy shrines. We don't need the regime militias or Hezbollah fighters to tell us what our duty is,"" the council said in a statement. ""This is our land, our country and our future."" Russia says ships ready to evacuate citizens . The commander of a group of Russian warships said his forces are prepared to evacuate Russian citizens from Syria. Captain Alexei Komarov said ships due to participate in military exercises off the Syrian coast are standing ready, according to the state-run news agency Itar-Tass. At least one ship, the Azov, is ported in the Israeli coastal city of Haifa. There are between 35,000 and 40,000 Russian families in Syria, the Syrian Ambassador to Russia, Riyad Haddad, said last week. He added that only about 100 families have returned to Russia since the start of the civil war. They were relocated in January after being bused out of the country. A large-scale evacuation from the Syrian coast would be a shift in confidence for Moscow, which has been a staunch ally of Damascus and the al-Assad government. The Russian military maintains a small base and uses the Syrian port of Tartus for resupply missions. READ MORE: World seeks answers as Syria civil war evolves .

"(CNN) -- Hardcore junkies of the series ""Arrested Development"" finally got their fix after a seven-year hiatus when Netflix released 15 new episodes Sunday, 3 a.m. ET. To binge watch or not to binge watch, that is the question. ""Modern Family's"" Jesse Tyler Ferguson observed on Twitter that the recaps from ""people who watched ALL of #ArrestedDevelopment in one sitting ... sound like crazy coke heads."" Binge-watch responsibly, everyone! But whether you binge watch or spoon it out a week at a time, will you feel satisfied when it's over? To be fair, the anticipation for series' return has been feverish and more than a year in the making, creating very high expectations. The first three seasons, which followed the outlandish antics of the dysfunctional Bluth family, was on Fox from 2003 to 2006. Those episodes were critically acclaimed and developed a sizable cult following -- a following that has only grown through DVDs and online streaming. The new online streaming format on Netflix gave creator Mitch Hurwitz more freedom with episode length, allowing far more variability than in the TV format. To work around cast availability, as stars like Jason Bateman, Michael Cera, David Cross, Will Arnett and Portia de Rossi have moved on to busy careers, each episode focuses on one member of the Bluth family rather than trying to incorporate the entire cast. So while everything feels familiar, it's not the same old ""Arrested Development."" Some critics have welcomed the fresh presentation, praising Hurwitz for pushing forward the show's legacy: . The Hollywood Reporter: ""The beauty about the Netflix version of 'Arrested Development' is that, given the laws of time and hype, it should not have succeeded. ... But the series quickly found its pacing, the elaborate 'Rashomon' structure revealed its glorious ambition and the combination of absurdity and intelligence meshed as well or better than you might have remembered from the original three seasons."" Los Angeles Times: ""In a sense, it is not merely a continuation of the show, but a celebration of it. ... I have, to be clear, watched it all -- and not with grim determination, but rather great, increasing satisfaction. ... The show improves as it gathers context, and before long you stop thinking about what makes this 'Arrested Development' different."" San Francisco Chronicle: ""Do the new episodes live up to those of the first three seasons which ended in 2006? Yes, and then some: The new season is not only as smart and absurdly funny as ever, but also reflects the rapid changes in how we watch television."" Yet others think the concept was a nice idea in theory that didn't pass muster in execution: . HitFix: ""[T]he result was both exhilarating and a wee bit disappointing. ... Out of 15 episodes, there are four or five episodes I'd put in the 'A' range. There were two or three episodes I'd put in the 'C' range. And the majority of the episodes were variably uneven, hardly devoid of brilliance and the sort of hilarity that most currently running shows can't even approach, but usually diluted to an infuriating degree by the structure and lack of structure of the endeavor. "" Wall Street Journal: "" 'Arrested Development' has lost a step or two in its long stint on the sidelines. The pacing is notably slower than during its original run and the show lacks the breathtaking density that characterized its glorious past. At its worst, the new/old 'Arrested Development' is reduced to doing an shaky imitation of itself: the characters and themes are there but the beats are slightly off, as is the tone."" Variety: ""Ultimately, this 'Arrested' revival plays a bit like a reunion special, where the individual cast members come out and take their curtain calls. After the warmth of seeing them reunited (or semi-reunited, given how rarely more than one or two are featured in a scene together), there's a sort of awkwardness to it, as if nobody really has much to say. 'Arrested Development's' long-awaited encore is like a lot of TV development -- namely, an interesting idea that was more exciting on paper."" BuzzFeed: ""Fifteen episodes later (after a few hours of sleep in between episodes 9 and 10), and I was left disappointed. ... Maybe when I have some time in the future, I'll give these new episodes another try, but if I'm looking for my 'Arrested Development' fix, I'll just go back to the original banana stand."" NYT: ""Chalk one up for the Internet: It has killed 'Arrested Development.' ... If you truly loved (the first three seasons of 'Arrested Development'), it's hard to imagine being anything but disappointed with this new rendition."" Regardless of the mixed reactions, Hurwitz and executive producer/narrator Ron Howard have had nothing but gratitude for the show's strong fanbase. ""Reaction from 'Arrested Development' fans so so gratifying,"" Howard tweeted, while Hurwitz posted a handwritten letter to Facebook. ""It's been our great joy to bring this to you on Netflix, where you can access it whenever and however you want,"" Hurwitz wrote in the letter, dated May 25. ""Except, you know, it's really meant to be watched in order. And you really should watch them all ... But really, this is yours now. Except for the obvious copyright issues. And you have to subscribe to Netflix."" OK, so maybe it's ""not completely yours I guess,"" Hurwitz continued. But there's still hope for the movie!","""Arrested Development"" premiered its fourth season on Netflix Sunday .
The anticipation has been building for more than a year .
Overall, critics were slightly disappointed .
Creator Mitch Hurwitz and producer Ron Howard have thanked fans for support ."
"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Should William Potts, an American fugitive living in Cuba, ever set foot in the United States again, he faces an indictment for airplane hijacking and a potentially lengthy prison term. So why is Potts now battling to return to the same country that wants to imprison him? In 1984, Potts hijacked a Piedmont Airlines passenger plane bound for Miami with 56 people aboard. A Black Panther and self-styled revolutionary, Potts dreamed of receiving military training in Cuba that he could use to overthrow the United States government. But first, the New York native had to find a way to get to the island. Potts' solution was to smuggle a .25-caliber pistol inside a fake cast on his arm. The handgun set off the metal detectors at Newark Airport, but all Potts had to do was flash his cast and an easy smile to breeze past security. After the plane took off, Potts went to bathroom, where he ditched the phony cast and put on what he calls his ""Black Panther costume"" of dark clothes and combat boots. He walked to the back of the airplane with the pistol in hand. A flight attendant told him to retake his seat, Potts said, but her eyes grew wide as she saw his changed demeanor and clothing. Potts gave her a note ordering the pilot to fly the plane to Cuba. Over the plane's telephone system, the pilot tried to convince Potts to end the hijacking. ""I had to be forceful with him,"" Potts remembered. ""I tell him, if we don't go to Cuba, this plane is going down. We are going to hell or Cuba."" As the plane crossed the bright blue water and the coastline and palm trees came into view, Potts still wasn't sure he was over Cuba. ""I had them go low and circle around,"" he said. ""I was looking for McDonald's and Coca-Cola and propaganda like that. I didn't see any of it, so I figured we must be here."" The plane landed in Havana, but Potts did not get the welcome he expected from his fellow revolutionaries. After years of hijackings to the island, the Cubans put hijackers like him on trial. Authorities told Potts that Fidel Castro's government was no longer involved in spreading armed revolution abroad. ""In a Machiavellian sense, the Cubans changed,"" he said. ""They simply changed. They used to do it, and now they don't do it."" Authorities offered to let Potts return with the plane he hijacked to the United States, where air piracy charges awaited him. Potts said he would face trial in Cuba. ""I thought I had won the case, and they gave me 15 years,"" Potts said, recalling his brief court proceedings in Cuba. ""I didn't even know what 15 was in Spanish. And they said 'quince.' I said, what is 'quince?' and my translator said 15 years. And I said, '15 years for who?' And they said, '15 years for you.' "" Even though he was sent to one of Cuba's toughest prisons, where he regularly battled with other inmates and the guards, Potts never lost faith in the same revolution that had become his jailer. ""If you are not able to suffer for the cause, you are just a play revolutionary,"" Potts said. Potts served his time -- 13Â½ years in prison and the rest under supervised release -- and tried to fit into Cuban society with the pidgin Spanish he learned in prison. His first marriage, to a Cuban, didn't work out. ""That was a clash of cultures,"" he explained. ""I am Muslim, and she's a santera."" A second failed marriage produced two daughters: Ntann, 7, and Assata Shakur, 11, named after the American fugitive also believed to be residing in Cuba whom the FBI added to its list of most wanted terrorists in May. The girl's mother, Aime, also a Cuban, said she didn't realize her husband was naming their daughter after a fellow militant, convicted of murdering a New Jersey state trooper. ""He likes Japanese things, so I thought it was a Japanese name,"" she said with a roll of her eyes. Raising his two daughters, Potts said, made him realize how much he missed family in the United States and wanted his children to meet them. He said he also needed to make amends and apologize in person to the passengers of the plane he hijacked. Potts still considers himself a revolutionary but says that both he and the times have changed, and violence is no longer an acceptable way to bring about change. ""I regret taking the plane and putting those people's lives in jeopardy,"" he said. ""I didn't have that perspective at the time, but I have it now and will have it until the day I die. I would have been responsible for all those people dying."" In 2009, Potts wrote President Barack Obama, requesting a pardon for the hijacking. Hearing nothing back, Potts then wrote the U.S. Attorney's Office in Miami to ask whether a plea deal could be worked out to take into account the time he had served in Cuba. ""Fifteen years in a communist prison that's been cited for human rights violations, I have paid my debts to society,"" he said. Potts again got no reply, but his daughters were given U.S. citizenship and passports. Potts wanted to travel with them to the U.S. and in September said he offered to surrender and face the charges awaiting him in the United States. Nearly six months later, his daughters have been living with relatives in the U.S. since December, but he is still waiting for an answer. But without a renewed U.S. passport, Potts can't join his girls. Dozens of fugitives are believed to be living in Cuba, from convicted cop killers to Puerto Rican separatists to suspects in a South Florida Medicare fraud scheme. The U.S. State Department has placed Cuba on the list of countries that support state terror, along with Iran and Syria, for providing a safe haven for fugitives from U.S. and international justice. Potts is in all likelihood the only fugitive on the island offering to be tried. ""No one's harboring me,"" Potts countered. ""I am trying to go back."" The U.S. Attorney's Office in Miami said Potts has been indicted for the 1984 hijacking but would not comment on why his offers to surrender have gone unanswered.","William Potts hijacked a plane to Havana in 1984 .

"(CNN) -- The brutal killing of a British soldier Wednesday near a military barracks in the Woolwich neighborhood of southeast London has shocked the United Kingdom, with Prime Minister David Cameron and other officials calling it a terrorist attack. Read more: London attack mirrors plot to behead Muslim soldier . Security was increased at army bases around London amid fears of additional attacks. The capital has not witnessed an alert of this kind since the summer of 2005, when London's public transport network was targeted with coordinated bomb attacks. Two men accused of carrying out the attack were shot by police and are under guard at hospitals. Latest updates . -- Two additional arrests were made by police Thursday tied to their investigation into the killing of a soldier in Woolwich, London's Metropolitan Police said on the department's official Twitter account. They were a 29-year-old man and a 29-year-old woman, both taken into custody ""on suspicion of conspiracy to murder."" -- Friends and acquaintances, as well as British media, named the meat-cleaver wielding man shown in a video aired by ITN after the attack as Michael Adebolajo. The other three suspects arrested -- including the one arrested at the scene along with Adebolajo -- have not yet been identified. -- Adebolajo and the other man arrested in Woolwich were in stable condition at separate South London hospitals Thursday evening, the Metropolitan Police tweeted. -- Abu Barra described his friend, Adebolajo, as a ""very caring"" man who was ""very vocal"" about his belief that Muslims worldwide were being oppressed. ""I wasn't surprised that (the attack) happened,"" Barra told CNN. ""...As long as (British) foreign policy is engaging in violence, they're only inviting violence in retaliation."" -- Warranted searches have been carried out at six residential addresses as part of what police described as ""a large, complex and fast-moving investigation which continues to develop."" Previously reported . -- It is understood that the two people suspected of carrying out the knife attack were known to Britain's domestic security service. They had featured in previous investigations into other people but were not themselves under surveillance. -- Prominent British Muslim radical leader Anjem Choudary said he knew one of the men named on social media as carrying out the attack. -- The soldier they killed was 25-year-old Lee Rigby, the father of a 2-year-old boy, the UK Ministry of Defense said. Rigby, described as ""always smiling,"" served as a machine gunner, played in the military's Corps of Drums, had been deployed to Afghanistan and was a recruiter in London at the time of his death, the military said. -- ""We have lost a brave soldier,"" Cameron said Thursday outside 10 Downing Street. -- The prime minister had cut shot a visit to Paris and rushed back to London, where he led a crisis meeting of top officials Thursday. Those in attendance included Home Secretary Theresa May, Defense Secretary Philip Hammond, London Mayor Boris Johnson and senior police and security officials. Read more: London attack: Terrorists targeting soldiers at home again? -- A video recorded by one of the two men immediately after the attack seemed to suggest a jihadist agenda. Cameron addressed the issue of Muslim extremism: ""This was not just an attack on Britain and on our British way of life. It was also a betrayal of Islam and of the Muslim communities who give so much to our country. There is nothing in Islam that justifies this truly dreadful act."" -- British Muslim groups registered horror over the killing of Rigby by attackers who said they were acting to avenge Muslim deaths overseas. Muslim commentators also suggested there is more that British leaders can do to address issues in their community, particularly among alienated young men. -- Police have deployed an extra 1,200 officers at key locations, including religious institutions and transportation hubs, police official Mark Rowley said. -- Capt. William Russell, a U.S. Air Force official, said Thursday that ""there are no force protection changes at our UK air bases in response to the incident in London."" -- U.S. President Barack Obama on Thursday condemned ""in the strongest terms"" the brutal killing of a British soldier in southeast London.

"(CNN) -- It's safe to say that Gillian Anderson has returned to television. The former ""X-Files"" star is involved in three TV series, beginning with a lead role in ""The Fall,"" a psychological crime thriller that debuted to rave reviews on May 13 in Britain. The show hits the U.S. on May 28 when it'll be available for streaming via Netflix. In ""The Fall,"" Anderson plays a detective who's pulled into a serial killer case with a unique twist to the genre: the audience knows the culprit from the beginning. But her on-screen exploration of killers doesn't stop there. Recently, she's been seen on NBC's ""Hannibal,"" playing Hannibal Lecter's psychiatrist. Later this summer, she'll start work on a new NBC show called ""Crisis,"" which got a series pick-up earlier this month. CNN spoke with Anderson recently from New York City about her new TV series, the groundbreaking nature of ""The X-Files,"" and whether Mulder and Scully will reunite on the big screen. CNN: In ""The Fall"" you play Stella Gibson, a detective looking for a serial killer. She seems like a very serious person. Is this one of your more serious roles? Gillian Anderson: I don't know about that. I've played a lot of serious women. I seem to be the go-to woman for seriousness, but as you will see, she's not all serious. There is some lightness in there and some different flavors of personality, I promise. CNN: The show tells the story in a unique way in the sense that the audience knows who the killer is from the onset. What's interesting for you about the way the story is told? Anderson: First of all, that hasn't really been done before which is always nice to jump into something that has a bit of uniqueness in this day and age of many, many shows about serial killers. The story lines themselves are very intricately woven and individually complex. The fact that you got a serial killer who is attractive, who is a good father and who is also a grief counselor on the side while he's stalking women and doing unthinkable things ... is really eerie. The fact that he's so recognizable as someone we might meet in a bar ... there's so many different layers in this story. It's a cross section of human life and death, and that's something in this that works on a much deeper level than just a simple tale of a serial killer hunted by a detective. CNN: When working on a show that deals with a serial killer, do you ever take your work home with you? Is it depressing to think about murder a lot? Anderson: I don't think about it all the time. I think I learned quite early on in my career when I was working on the ""X-Files"" that what's on the page, stays on the page. What's on the set, stays on the set. Very often if I'm working on dark material, I work on it in day time. So it doesn't effect my night. But also, it's easy ... we talk about compartmentalizing in the series -- I think it's easy to compartmentalize. CNN: You also played Hannibal Lecter's therapist on NBC's ""Hannibal."" Is the psychology of killers something you know well at this point in your life? Anderson: No, not necessarily I don't feel like I'm any particular expert on it even though I've played many characters who seem to be hunters. Hannibal was something that came out the blue. Bryan Fuller, the creator, convinced me how fun it would be to come play with them for a little while. How cool it would be to be Hannibal's psychiatrist. I believed him and said yes. It's funny. I don't think about these things all together; I think about them individually. CNN: In some other alternate universe, could you be a therapist? Anderson: I could definitely be a therapist. I could not be a forensics pathologist or a detective. CNN: TV's having this great creative moment right now that everyone is pointing out. Do you think ""X-Files"" forged a path in certain ways in terms of what the medium could do? Anderson: It was No 1. It was the first one. There's been a plethora of copy cats and a plethora of different shows that tried to emulate not just the success, but the formula, but also the production values. Our show was the beginning of huge amounts of money going onto the screen. But also, the darkness of it: we were the first show to kind of ""turn off the lights"" and just light ourselves by flashlight -- and also the subject matter. The dark subject matter, the paranormal subject matter, the science-fiction, the duo, the intelligent woman on TV ... they were kinda No. 1 with all that. CNN: You do play a lot of smart people. Anderson: [Laughs.] I do play so many people that are so much smarter than I am. It's ridiculous. If only I could contain the information that they spout in my practical life, that would be very good. CNN: You have another series due out later this year on NBC called ""Crisis."" What's your character like on that? Anderson: It seems like that's going to be mid-season. The story as a whole is that there's a high school of elite children in Washington D.C., including the son of the president, and they're on their way to New York for a school trip and their bus gets hijacked. I play a mother of one of the kids who is the son of a CEO of a multinational [corporation]. The story is about what these high-powered people will do to get back the things they care most about, which is their kids. CNN: Is there talk about another ""X-Files"" movie? Anderson: Yep, yep. People talk about it. It has to be written. At the point that it's written, if it's good, David and I have always said we'll be involved. So we'll see.","Gillian Anderson portrays a detective on ""The Fall""

"Sanford, Florida (CNN) -- Trayvon Martin's familiarity with guns, his marijuana use, and fights he may have been in cannot be brought up in George Zimmerman's murder trial, the judge overseeing the case ruled Tuesday. At the hearing two weeks before the scheduled start of the trial, Judge Debra Nelson handed a series of victories to the prosecution when she barred the defense from introducing some information about Martin. Defense attorneys argued that some of the evidence could prove crucial in backing up Zimmerman's claim of self-defense, depending on what the prosecution argues. Certain evidence could ultimately be raised during the trial, however, if it is proven relevant and admissible based on what the prosecution presents, the judge decided. Follow a live blog of Tuesday's hearing at HLNTV.com . Nelson left the door open on one issue involving marijuana. Defense attorneys say toxicology tests show Martin had enough THC -- the key active ingredient in marijuana -- in his system to indicate he may have smoked the drug a couple of hours before the shooting. Nelson barred any mention of this from opening statements but said she will rule later on whether it will be admissible after she hears defense experts' testimony about the marijuana use. Marijuana use in general can come up during jury selection, the judge said. The attorneys also cannot bring up Martin's text messages. The defense argued that texts from the day of the shooting show the teen was ""hostile."" The judge also agreed to block previous text messages from Martin about drugs and a gun. Zimmerman, who is out on bail, did not appear at the hearing. He's charged with second-degree murder in the February 26, 2012, shooting. He was a neighborhood watch volunteer when he called 911 reporting ""a suspicious person"" in the neighborhood, who turned out to be 17-year-old Martin. The shooting put a national spotlight on Zimmerman's hometown of Sanford, Florida, and sparked fresh debates about race relations and gun laws. The decision not to bring charges against Zimmerman led to the dismissal of the town's police chief and the appointment of a special prosecutor, who accused the homeowner of unjustly profiling and killing Martin. Defense: State didn't turn over some evidence . Nelson did agree to one key request from the defense: to hold a hearing on whether the state failed to turn over some evidence. The defense called Wesley White, a former employee of the state attorney's office, who said the prosecution did not turn over certain photos -- including one of a firearm in someone's hand -- as well as some deleted text messages. Nelson agreed to subpoena the state IT investigator who allegedly issued a report about the photos and text messages. But she denied a defense request for a delay in the start of the trial, setting the start of jury selection for June 10. Nelson also granted the prosecution's motion to bar evidence about why it took so long to arrest Zimmerman. She denied a defense motion asking that the jury be taken to the crime scene and called it ""disingenuous"" in light of another defense motion requesting anonymity for the jury. The jurors will remain anonymous and will be referred to by their numbers only, she said. Nelson set a hearing for Friday on whether the media will be allowed to show their faces. Gun, drug texts feature in new evidence . Judge to rule on screaming heard in 911 calls . Defense attorneys also raised questions Tuesday about an analysis that suggests Martin might be heard screaming in the background of a 911 call just before the shooting. Voice identification experts hired by the prosecution say that they don't know for certain whose voice it is and that there isn't enough sound to make a conclusive determination. One analyst, Alan Reich, said he believes Martin can be heard saying the word ""stop."" Reich told the Washington Post that he believes the voice is Martin, but another analyst told the Post that no determination can be made. Defense attorneys said Tuesday that in a deposition on Friday, Reich said he had not completed his report and would need another two weeks. The defense does not want Reich's analysis admitted. Judge Nelson ruled that in a hearing at the end of next week, the science being used for voice identification will be discussed, and she will determine whether it is admissible at trial. If she approves the science as admissible, there's still another barrier for either side to present witnesses using that science. Once the trial begins, when either side wants to call a witness who conducted such an analysis, the judge will consider whether the scientist's qualifications give him or her adequate expertise to weigh in. Zimmerman will not seek 'stand your ground' hearing . No gold teeth . While defense attorneys had argued in court papers that they may want other details about Martin admitted -- including an assertion that he had removable gold tooth caps -- they agreed Tuesday that they don't expect it to become relevant at trial. Nelson ruled there will be no such mention in the trial. Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Martin's family, previously lashed out against the defense for trying to get such details admitted. ""Is the defense trying to prove Trayvon deserved to be killed by George Zimmerman because (of) the way he looked?"" Crump asked in a statement. ""If so, this stereotypical and closed-minded thinking is the same mindset that caused George Zimmerman to get out of his car and pursue Trayvon, an unarmed kid who he didn't know."" Zimmerman's brother: Drop murder charge . After the hearing, Robert Zimmerman, brother of George, called on the state to drop the second-degree murder charge. ""George lived in a community plagued by crime and was the first to come forward to help his neighbors,"" he said. ""George is a good, decent and honest man. It is now my honor to advocate for him. George is in the fight of his life quite literally. As the oldest son, the only right thing for me to do is deliver him back to our parents. The only right way to do it is by relying on truth. We are not a wealthy family but we are rich in honor."" Authorities initially ""did their job when they refused to charge someone with a crime who had committed no crime,"" Robert Zimmerman said. ""In this country, you don't charge someone with any crime solely to assuage the concerns of misinformed masses."" Daryl Parks, another attorney for the Martin family, praised Tuesday's hearing. ""Without question, today was a very important day in this case,"" he said. ""What was rather clear: All of the bad information put out by the defense team will not be evidence in this case,"" Parks added. None of the information that was barred, he argued, ""had anything to do"" with the confrontation that led to Martin being killed. CNN's Victor Blackwell reported from Sanford, Florida; CNN's Josh Levs and Graham Winch reported from Atlanta. CNN's Jessica Thill and Rich Phillips contributed to this report.","NEW: Zimmerman's brother calls on the prosecution to drop the murder charge .

"(Mashable) -- When the Daytona 500 ran into a protracted delay following an explosion and fire on the track Monday night, NASCAR driver Brad Keselowski did what any social media addict would: grabbed his phone and began posting status updates to Twitter. Then he gained more than 100,000 followers in less than two hours. Keselowski's fellow driver Juan Pablo Montoya crashed into a safety vehicle mid-race. The collision and jet fuel â€” the safety vehicle reportedly holds 200 gallons of jet kerosene â€” sparked a huge ball of fire, although both vehicles' drivers appeared to avoid serious injury. The race was halted. From his spot in the racecar traffic jam, Keselowski sent this tweet to his (at the time) less than 85,000 followers. More than an hour later, the race resumed. Keselowski's follower count topped 185,000. Keselowski's initial tweet set off a hysteria in the sports Twittersphere, and triggered a set of funny exchanges between him and his fans. Keselowski then passed the continued delay with a steady stream of tweets updating and reacting to the accident and to-be-continued race. Eventually, the Daytona 500 got underway again, and Keselowski passed the message on to his swollen follower count by retweeting NASCAR's senior vice president Steve O'Donnell's message: ""Alright. Run jet quickly over area-drivers strapped in. Will run some caution laps and make sure we are good. Thanks for patience!"" Earlier, Keselowski had retweeted fan Jessica Lynn Burkett, who spoke for pretty much everyone when she posted: ""So we have a Monday night #NascarPrimetime #daytona500 race, jet dryer blow up and @keselowski tweeting from his car.... #AWESOMENESS!!!"" Keselowski then got into a wreck of his own after the race resumed. No word whether it was a case of tweeting-while-driving, but he did post another message to his account minutes after his crash.

"(CNN) -- A young transient who said he was trying to shake zombies off a stolen semi-trailer truck he was driving caused a major freeway incident in southern California that sent four people to the hospital and tied up traffic for hours, the California Highway Patrol said. Jerimiah Clyde Hartline, 19, was arrested in connection with the theft an 18-wheeler fully loaded with strawberries on Sunday near Temecula, according to the highway patrol. Officer Nate Baer said Hartline had been riding with truck driver Daniel Martinez since his trip started in Tennessee after being kicked out of his home. When Martinez stopped to fill out paperwork at an inspection site, he left Hartline alone in the truck, Baer said. Hartline then jumped behind the wheel of the truck, sped off and soon after crashed into several vehicles on the freeway, Baer said. Hartline was apparently under the influence of a substance that caused him to hallucinate, Baer said. ""He thought zombies were chasing him and clinging to the truck,"" Baer said in an e-mail. According to the highway patrol, Hartline lost control of the truck and first collided with a Toyota Tacoma. The Tacoma collided with a Toyota 4Runner, and it hit a Mercedes-Benz.

"(CNN) -- Opening arguments are scheduled for Monday in Philadelphia in the first case in which an official of a Roman Catholic archdiocese has been accused of protecting abusive priests by moving them from parish to parish. Monsignor William Lynn has pleaded not guilty to conspiracy and endangering the welfare of a child. Lynn served as the vicar of clergy in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia from 1992 to 2004, a position in which he was responsible for investigating reports that priests had sexually abused children. A grand jury alleged that he knowingly allowed priests accused of abuse to continue in the ministry in roles in which they had access to children, according to the district attorney's office. Lynn ""acted as if his job was to protect the abuser, never the abused,"" a January 2011 grand jury report concluded. But Lynn's lawyers argue that the monsignor had informed his superiors -- including Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua, who died in January -- that priests in the archdiocese were assaulting children. Pope leads open-air Mass in Mexico . The Lynn case has had reverberations across the country, including the October 2011 arrest of Bishop Robert W. Finn in Kansas City, Missouri, on charges that he failed to report suspected child abuse by a priest. Finn pleaded not guilty. Lynn's case has already had some surprises in the weeks leading up to this point. The latest came Thursday, when a co-defendant, defrocked priest Edward Avery, accepted a plea deal and was sentenced to 2-1/2 to five years in prison. The deal does not require Avery to testify against Lynn, leaving open the question of how it ultimately affects the case. ""This is a very mysterious plea,"" says CNN legal analyst Paul Callan. ""And it will be interesting to see as the trial rolls on why this plea was really entered, because there's something going on that we don't know about at this point in time."" In February, the defense had a bombshell of its own. Lynn's attorneys presented a document that seems to show that in 1994, Bevilacqua ordered shredded a document prepared by Lynn that listed the names of suspected abusers. In jury selection process, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported Common Pleas Court Judge M. Teresa Sarmina as saying in open court, ""Anybody that doesn't' think there is widespread sexual abuse within the Catholic Church is living on another planet."" The comment prompted calls for Sarmina to recuse herself. She has not. Because of a court-mandated gag order, all parties in the case are prevented from commenting. But Bill Donohue, president of the Catholic League, says Sarmina was inappropriate and incorrect. ""We don't have a problem today,"" Donahue said. ""We had it in the '60s and '70s and in the first part of the 1980s. If [Sarmina] goes in there with that mindset, I think she should have recused herself. She's already --as far as I'm concerned -- she's damaged goods."" Cuba has complicated relationship with Church . Victims' advocates say the Catholic Church still has a problem with priest abuse. ""We have seen no evidence either that the Catholic Church has really changed anything,"" says Barbara Blaine, president of Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests. ""We have seen them change their public relations and their statements, but we still haven't seen one bishop to be fired or publicly punished for enabling or covering up for sexual predator priests."" Blaine hopes this case will give survivors like Rich Green some justice. Green, the nephew of deceased Cardinal John O'Connor of New York, says he was abused by a priest at a Philadelphia high school in 1990. The priest died in 1999, and the statute of limitations has run out on Green's ability to sue the Philadelphia archdiocese. Green did receive a settlement from the Archdiocese of Wilmington, Delaware, where the priest's order is based, and says he plans to attend Lynn's trial as often as he can. ""We are asking for these people who are responsible for destroying our lives to be held accountable for what they did to us,"" Green said. ""We are the ones telling the truth, and I don't understand why the Catholic Church can't tell the truth."" Finding the truth will be the job of a jury that is likely to hear testimony from alleged victims; a possible taped deposition from Bevilacqua; and perhaps from Lynn himself.","Monsignor William Lynn has pleaded not guilty to two criminal counts .

"(CNN) -- It's rare for Barcelona or Real Madrid not to be leading Spain's La Liga at the Christmas break. But Atletico Madrid could break the trend this season. Atletico replaced Barcelona atop the division after a comeback 3-2 win against Levante on Saturday in Madrid. Diego Costa once again provided the firepower, scoring two goals -- including the late winner from the penalty spot. Atletico pulled ahead of Barcelona by three points and is guaranteed of staying top heading into January if the defending champion doesn't win at Getafe on Sunday. ""We have a lot of heart and (work hard),"" Atletico manager Diego Simeone told reporters. ""If we go day by day, we will be able to fight."" Simeone's side is already assured of finishing above city rival Real Madrid come the end of 2013 given it has an eight-point advantage. Just as it did last week in the league against Valencia, the home team started slowly and Levante -- which entered the game with two straight victories after losing five in a row -- took full advantage. Andreas Ivanschitz pounced in the first minute as Atletico conceded for the first time in four games in the league. Mid-table Levante almost made it two but Thibaut Courtois denied David Barral. Atletico was rattled and Tiago was fortunate not to receive a card -- maybe red -- when he barged into Juanfran. Diego Godin's header in the 30th minute made it 1-1 and when Costa volleyed home his league leading 18th goal in the 47th minute with his left foot, it appeared as if Atletico would coast. Pedro Rios, however, leveled when he raced through on goal and finished sublimely in the 57th minute. Costa had the last word, converting a penalty in the 77th minute. Costa saw his penalty saved against Valencia and Keylor Navas got a hand to Saturday's effort, though not enough to keep it out of the net. ""A striker always needs goals, but what really matters is that these goals help to score points,"" Costa told reporters. Juanfran received a red card in the 90th minute when he clashed with Filipe Luis.","Atletico Madrid rallies to beat Levante 3-2 to move into top spot in Spain's La Liga .

"(CNN) -- Remember the CrackBerry? Five years ago, the buzzing gadget was all the rage -- the rock star of mobile communication and seemingly every office drone's high-tech status symbol. Sober-minded professionals talked about BlackBerry addiction and ""phantom vibrations"" that caused users to reach for the devices even when they weren't actually doing anything. ""It's like Pavlov's dog,"" B. Marc Averitt, a technology investor, told The New York Times in 2007, referring to the gut-level longing users felt for the click-clack of the phone's keyboard and humming notice that a new personal message had arrived. Fast-forward to Thursday, and what was the word? ""Depressing. That's the only word that comes to mind after reading the RIM Q1 financial results press release and listening to the conference call,"" Chris Umiastowski wrote for the site CrackBerry, which emerged in 2007, eight years after BlackBerry's first two-way paging device was released. ""(But) as crappy as the results were, I'm not going to write up a death certificate for RIM here."" He didn't. And that shows that the folks who still love their BlackBerry still really love their BlackBerry. But let's be clear: Some analysts do say it's over for the BlackBerry. ""Anyone who's been paying attention isn't surprised by BlackBerry maker Research In Motion's recent collapse,"" a blogger for ReadWriteWeb wrote. ""It's unfortunate, but it's been inevitable."" BlackBerry maker Research In Motion announced Thursday it is laying off 5,000 people -- and said earnings for the past three months were significantly less than expected, with the company reporting a first-quarter loss of $518 million. Sales were down 40% from last year. Furthermore, the new operating system it's pinning its hopes on will be delayed until next year, or, a full year after it was originally expected. Couple all of that with more reports that the company might be looking to sell off its once dominant service, and you had what amounted to a devastating head-kick for the Canadian company. It capped off a gut-punch of a financial year that has seen RIM's stock price drop 70%. So, what happened? As an even more gadget-obsessed society than we were five years ago, how did we stop being BlackBerry fiends. Photos: Our mobile ""addiction"" Well, how's this for cruel and cosmic irony? A day after the dismal report, something called the iPhone celebrated its fifth birthday. You might have heard of it. About 217 million of them have been sold. It may not have been the very first smartphone. But Apple made it sexy. And fun. And the BlackBerry, to many, would soon become the thing they give you at work. ""Apple's new iPhone could do to the cell phone market what the iPod did to the portable music player market: crush it pitilessly beneath the weight of its own superiority,"" Lev Grossman wrote for Time. ""This is unfortunate for anybody else who makes cell phones, but it's good news for those of us who use them."" The guy has since written a book called ""The Magicians."" He must have had a crystal ball. Critics say RIM was too slow to react. To be sure, it maintained (and, to some degree, still does) the hard-core business user more concerned about reliability and security than playing ""Angry Birds."" But for many, the thrill was gone. By the time they brought a touchscreen BlackBerry to market, the second-generation iPhone 3G was already capturing hearts and minds. And even the goal of becoming the ""other smartphone"" got further away when Google unleashed its Android operating system and opened it up to phone makers everywhere. The first Android phone, the HTC Dream, hit stores in October 2008, around the same time as the BlackBerry Thunder. Google's quicker response paid dividends, and now there are more phones running Android phones than there are iPhones. Ditto all of the above for the BlackBerry Playbook, RIM's entry into the tablet market that, to be kind, failed to meet sales goals. None of this, as CNNMoney notes, means your BlackBerry will be a useless brick in the near future. RIM still has 78 million subscribers and $2.2 billion in cash on hand. But as a cultural icon, it's hard to see the magic of the mid-2000s returning for the BlackBerry. It's enough to make you want to tap out a condolence note for the company -- even if many of us will be doing so on a touchscreen.

"(CNN) -- Finland ruined Sergio Ramos' 100th appearance for Spain on Friday as the planet's 87th-ranked team held the No. 1 side and defending World Cup champion in a qualifier for next year's tournament in Brazil. Real Madrid defender Ramos became the eighth player from his country to reach the milestone, and duly put his side ahead with a header from a corner four minutes into the second half in Gijon. Finland's dogged defending had frustrated Spain's intricate passing game, and the visiting side scored a shock equalizer in the 79th minute as Teemu Pukki got behind the defense to slot in Alexander Ring's low cross. The draw extended Spain's unbeaten run to 19 matches, but left Vicente del Bosque's team second in Group I behind France ahead of Tuesday's trip to Paris. Only the top nation will automatically qualify from the five-side group, with the runner-up hoping to go into the playoffs. ""We controlled the match but it slipped away in the final minutes,"" Ramos told reporters. ""Doubtless we were thinking too much about France -- now we really do have to think about that one. They are a great team, but we can beat them."" The French won 3-1 at home to third-placed Georgia to go two points clear of Spain after four matches, with goals from striker Olivier Giroud and midfielders Mathieu Valbuena and Franck Ribery. The Finns remained bottom, with two points from three games. In Group A, Croatia all but ended the qualification hopes of neighbor Serbia with a 2-0 victory in the first clash between the two teams since they became independent nations after the war that split Yugoslavia. With away fans banned in Zagreb due to ongoing tensions, Mario Mandzukic took advantage of a mistake by Aleksandar Kolarov to score the opening goal and fellow striker Ivica Olic sealed Croatia's fourth win in five matches. It put the Croats second on goal difference behind Belgium, while Wales moved above Serbia into third place with a 2-1 win over Scotland. Belgium won 2-0 away to Macedonia, with Eden Hazard's second-half penalty adding to Kevin De Bruyne's opener. Bulgaria consolidated second place in Group B with a 6-0 thrashing of Malta, as Aleksandar Tonev scored a hat-trick, while Denmark won 3-0 away to the Czech Republic to claim third place on goal difference -- but four points adrift of a possible playoff spot. Germany moved five points clear at the top of Group C with a 3-0 win over Kazakhstan, while second-placed Sweden drew 0-0 at home to the Republic of Ireland. Austria moved above the Irish into third on goal difference after thrashing bottom side the Faroe Islands 6-0. The Netherlands marched to a fifth successive win in Group D, beating Estonia 3-0. Hungary remained second on goal difference above Romania after conceding a late equalizer in their 2-2 draw -- a result which left both nations five points behind the Dutch. Turkey beat bottom side Andorra to be four points further back in fourth place. Switzerland stayed top in Group E without kicking a ball, as Albania moved up to second on goal difference above Iceland after their respective one-goal wins away to Norway and Slovenia. Portugal's hopes of automatic qualification from Group F suffered a big blow as Cristiano Ronaldo's team needed late goals from Helder Postiga and Fabio Coentrao to draw 3-3 in Israel. The result left Israel second above the Portuguese on goal difference, with both teams four points adrift of Russia -- whose match in Northern Ireland was postponed until Saturday due to heavy snow. Bosnia-Herzegovina moved three points clear of Greece at the top of Group G after winning 3-1 against the previously undefeated 2004 European champions, with two goals from striker Edin Dzeko. Third-placed Slovakia's hopes of a second successive World Cup appearance were dented by a 1-1 draw with Lithuania. Montenegro and England set up a crunch Group H clash on Tuesday after contrasting wins. A 1-0 victory in Moldova put Montenegro two points clear at the top, as both teams had a player sent off and striker Mirko Vucinic netted the only goal in the 79th minute. England thrashed San Marino 8-0 as striker Jermain Defoe scored twice, while Ukraine moved up to third on goal difference above Poland with a 3-1 away victory in a match between the Euro 2012 host nations.","Spain battling to automatically qualify for 2014 World Cup after Finland draw .

"ROSWELL, Georgia (CNN) -- The lights were dimmed, soft music was playing and a scented candle burned on the counter. In the center of it all was Julie Trotter -- moaning through hard labor contractions. Doula Kai Martin Short works to ease Julie Trotter's pain during labor. For more than six hours, Trotter, a 23-year-old from Duluth, Georgia, tried different techniques to ease the pain of natural childbirth. Not only was her husband offering encouragement, but so was her doula, Kai Martin Short. ""She definitely was a lifesaver for sure,"" Trotter says. ""She used a lot of counter-pressure through each contraction, and that helped so much."" Doula is a Greek word meaning ""woman's servant."" Part birthing coach, part mother's assistant, doulas are showing up in more delivery rooms than ever before. Short, from Atlanta, Georgia, is among 2,500 certified doulas in the United States. ""Doulas trust birth and are not afraid of it even when the mom and dad get afraid,"" Short said. ""We're there to just say things are fine; you're doing great; this is all normal."" Health Minute: Watch how a doula helps a woman through labor » . Short offers more than comforting words. For a flat fee of $700 per client, she meets with the parents before the baby's due date to talk about their expectations and to share techniques to be used during labor. She is by the mother's side in the delivery room and visits the parents at home after the baby is born to offer advice on such topics as breastfeeding. In her three years as a doula, Short has attended more than 30 births. Her training with a group called DONA International involved 26 hours of instruction on pregnancy, childbirth and comfort measures. ""Whatever [mothers] need, whether it be changing positions, encouragement, massage or saying comforting words, there are so many things we do to help with the process,"" Short said. Short tries to create a calm atmosphere in the delivery room with music and candles. Throughout the labor, she massages the birthing mother's back and rubs her head. Another one of her tricks to relieve pain involves having the woman sit on a big rubber exercise ball during contractions. She encourages the father or other family members to get involved in the process and shows them how to help the mother breathe through contractions. ""I think it's really hard for a loved one to see their loved one in pain,"" Short said. ""They don't really know how to help them."" While Short has plenty of advice for parents, she has no medical training and is not supposed to offer a medical opinion. She does not take the place of a doctor, midwife or nurse. Her role is to strictly work with the family and motivate the mother during labor and delivery. But Dr. Sean Lambert, an OB/GYN who delivered Trotter's baby at North Fulton Hospital in Alpharetta, Georgia, says that sometimes, doulas can cross the line. ""It's almost as if some women and some couples have turned to them for too much advice and guidance,"" he said. ""Occasionally, it will cut across what we recommend on a medical basis."" Short says she's never had any clashes with medical professionals. ""Really, it's separate roles,"" she said. But she can understand how the relationship can get tricky. ""It can be territorial sometimes if the doula is a little bit more strong-minded or opinionated."" Short encourages her clients to ask questions, and she's careful in her approach to the answers she gives. Ten days after the birth of her son, Braydon, Trotter reflected on the experience. ""It was a perfect one in my eyes,"" she said. ""I think having a doula definitely would be helpful for anybody, and I wouldn't change anything about the birth."" Short enjoys seeing new families come to life and concludes, ""The best part for me is helping women realize what their bodies can do. Just having that support can make all the difference.""

"San Diego (CNN) -- Here are six words I thought I'd never hear myself say: ""I can relate to Mick Jagger."" You might think that there wouldn't be much common ground between a 69-year-old British rock 'n' roll icon and a 45-year-old Mexican-American columnist. But there is. Apparently, our philosophies on raising kids without spoiling them with parental handouts are quite similar. This information comes courtesy of Jagger's chatty ex-wife, Jerry Hall. According to the British tabloid newspaper The Daily Mail, Hall said she has been pressuring Jagger -- unsuccessfully, I might add -- to dip into his fortune (estimated at about $300 million) and buy houses for three of his kids who are in their 20s. Yes, that's right. I said houses. Not cars or clothes or jet skis. Hall is going for broke and asking Jagger to purchase houses for the three children -- Lizzie, 29, James, 27, and Georgia, 21. The daughters are models, and the son is a musician. The couple has a fourth child, Gabriel, 15, but he still lives at home with his mom. The way that Jerry sees it, Mick can easily afford the purchase. The multimillionaire reportedly has five homes of his own. So what's the problem? The problem, according to the tabloid newspaper, is that Jagger, who is known to be ""famously careful with his pennies,"" is firmly opposed to these types of ""parental housing subsidies."" According to the newspaper, the Jagger thinks that his children have already enjoyed many advantages in life and that setting them up in their own homes will do more harm than good. Those who know Jagger well -- including his oldest daughter, Jade, who is the only child of his marriage to ex-wife Bianca -- say that he strongly believes that children ought not think themselves entitled to their parents' money and that they have to make their own way in life. Jade, who has her own jewelry store, told the newspaper: ""I was never a trust-fund child. Dad's got a healthy attitude toward work. You have to look after yourself."" Bravo. Americans really need to hear that message. And not just our kids; all of us should get an earful. At a time when runaway entitlement spending and a national debt of more than $16 trillion threaten the economic future of the United States, the national motto has become ""Where's mine?"" Now more than ever, Americans need to understand that part of being a good parent is teaching their adult children to stand on their own two feet. As a parent of three young children, I can imagine that this isn't easy to do. My kids know that I'm an easy mark. And I struggle daily with saying no -- or, in some cases, with making them do chores and save their allowances to buy things on their own. But I understand where Jagger is coming from, and I applaud him. He's on the right track, and a lot of other people are on the wrong one. Rolling Stones: Never-before-seen photos . Somewhere, in the vast universe of parenting, we lost our way. We've convinced ourselves that loving our kids also means supporting them more than we need to. That is not so. Caring for our children is one thing, but making them dependent on us well into adulthood is another. The former is the sign of a good parent; the latter is a recipe for trouble. Billionaire Warren Buffet refers to it as the ""lottery of the womb"" -- this sense that some people have that they are entitled to their parents' money through inheritance or lavish gifts. In writing about parenting over the years, and talking about it with other parents, I've become convinced that a lot of parents with young children worry more that they're giving their kids too much rather than too little. The concern is that in trying to keep their kids from struggling, they're making their lives too comfy. At the very least, most of us are probably giving our kids much more than what we were given by our parents when we were growing up. We need to ask: What harm is this doing? These days, when you're raising kids, materialism doesn't merely knock on your door. It busts through. Ten-year-olds are asking for cell phones. When our kids want something and ask us for it, we might ask ourselves three questions: Is it a good price? Can we afford it? Do they deserve it? But those are the wrong questions. We need ask ourselves only one question: Will buying my child this item teach him positive values or negative ones? You see, it doesn't matter how much money Mick Jagger has or what he can afford. That is not the issue. The issue is that he's trying to teach his children some values, something that isn't always easy to do when you're one of the megawealthy. Like the saying goes, you want to leave your kids enough money so they can do something with their lives -- but not so much that they can do nothing. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","According to the Daily Mail, Mick Jagger's ex-wife asked him to buy houses for their kids .

"(CNN) -- What do the 2010 heat wave in Russia, last year's Texas drought, and the 2003 heat wave in Europe have in common? All are examples of extreme weather caused by climate change, according to a new study from NASA scientist James Hansen. ""This is not a climate model or a prediction but actual observations of weather events and temperatures that have happened,"" he wrote in a Washington Post opinion piece meant to accompany the study. ""Our analysis shows that it is no longer enough to say that global warming will increase the likelihood of extreme weather and to repeat the caveat that no individual weather event can be directly linked to climate change. To the contrary, our analysis shows that, for the extreme hot weather of the recent past, there is virtually no explanation other than climate change."" The study, which was published by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, looks at the past six decades of global temperatures and finds what Hansen described as a ""stunning"" rise in the frequency of extremely hot summers. It compared what is happening now to what was happening between 1951-1980. In those years, extremely hot temperatures covered less than 0.2% of the planet. Now, those temperatures cover about 10% of the land area, the study said. It dismissed the idea that specific weather patterns are by themselves sufficient to explain today's extreme anomalies. Phenomena like La Nina have always been around, but large areas of extreme warming have only come about with climate change, the study said. ""The odds that natural variability created these extremes are minuscule, vanishingly small. To count on those odds would be like quitting your job and playing the lottery every morning to pay the bills,"" wrote Hansen. Hansen directs research at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York and is a longtime environmental activist.","James Hansen argues that rising global temperatures are fueling an increase in extreme weather .

"(CNN) -- As the nation continues to grieve for the six adults and 20 children taken too soon in the Newtown, Connecticut, school shooting, a hero from another generation has slipped peacefully into the pages of history. There were many who knew Sen. Dan Inouye, a Democrat and Medal of Honor recipient from Hawaii who passed away Monday, better than we did. But we had the good fortune of sitting with him this past summer, interviewing him and hearing some of the remarkable stories from his life in America's service. The portrait that emerged was that of a man of courage, character, and, perhaps above all, a singular spirit of peace and good will that was forged, paradoxically, amid some of the most horrendous carnage of the Second World War. News: Hawaii's Daniel Inouye, Senate's second longest-serving member, dead at 88 . Some of Inouye's deeds -- his valor serving on the German front in one of America's most decorated (and heavily wounded) units, his Herculean political efforts on behalf of his home state -- have been well remarked. What we were especially struck by was his quiet, sagelike humanity. There was his story, for example, of the day during the war when he came upon a German soldier who appeared to be preparing to kill him. The German, as Inouye told it, put his hand into his shirt, and Inouye, thinking he was reaching for his weapon, ""smashed him in the face."" As the man hit the ground, his hand fell out of his shirt, revealing photographs -- the soldier's wife, his kids. ""So help me, up until that moment, I looked upon Germans as enemies, period,"" said Inouye, who had by then killed many enemy soldiers already. ""From that moment, I looked upon him as a father, son, uncle, boyfriend. He was human. And it's not easy to kill."" It was, he said, what he always told people when they expressed disbelief that he, a decorated veteran, could stand up against the war in Iraq. ""You've got to convince me before we go to war,"" he maintained. ""You would never forget running over a dog -- the bump. If you don't forget that, how can you forget killing a human being?"" To hear Inouye talk was to sit beside a still, fathomless pool -- he spoke with a measured calm and wisdom that made clear how deep the dignity beneath it ran. In that way, he called to mind an echo of former Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield -- of whom, Inouye said, ""If there was a mentor, it was him."" And he carried Mansfield's stoic ability to forge consensus and compromise with him, far into a legislative era known for its strident opposites. Of his 12 subcommittees, Inouye told us in July, ""Nine of them have reported out their bills almost unanimously. About six were unanimous -- 30-0. The others were 29-1, 28-2. ... That's this month. It can be done! ... And 30-0 includes (Senate Minority Leader Mitch) McConnell!"" His secret was deceptively straightforward: a steady practice of simple gestures -- sitting with senators who had objections, calling a senior Republican ""vice chairman"" instead of ""ranking member"" (""I hate that word 'ranking' -- it's something like 'stink'!""), not speaking ill of anyone to the press. ""It might take some patience, but when I found out that you were pissed about (a) program, I'd sit down with you and talk about it,"" he told us. ""Little things like that make a difference."" It was a basic humanity and a largeness of vision that Inouye extended to individuals from all backgrounds, born not only out of his experiences seeing his own people -- Japanese-Americans -- vilified and interned during World War II (Inouye himself signed up as soon as the U.S. government lifted its ban on American-born Japanese enlistments), but from his own crucibles in the war. Describing the injury that cost him his right arm and very nearly his life, Inouye told us of being taken to the Army hospital, of being initially counted a hopeless case, of having his arm amputated without anesthesia, of ultimately receiving 17 blood transfusions to stay alive. Of those 17 transfusions, he explained: . ""That made a little difference in my outlook on life. In our last battle, the regiment was attached to the 92nd Division -- all African-American. Hospitals were run by the 92nd Division, and in those days, I don't know about the other hospitals, but in the one I was in, (the blood) came in a glass bottle, with tape -- donated by so and so, private, 92nd Division. So you know he's African-American. Well I got 17 pints. ""If it weren't for (the 92nd), I wouldn't be here. The war did a lot to change your ideas. I looked upon (people of color), as I do today, as brothers. What else can I do? After all, I've got the same blood."" Throughout its history, the nation has been blessed to have men like Inouye -- reserved, unboastful men, whose actions show the deep reservoir of quiet honor from which they draw their strength. Who show the courage that Hemingway called ""grace under pressure."" When he was first brought to the Army field hospital after sustaining the wounds that would claim his arm, Inouye related, ""The doctors looked at me; they're mumbling among themselves,"" he recalled. ""Two minutes later a chaplain comes up -- opening words: 'God loves you.' ""I said: 'I know that. I love him too,"" he recounted with a chuckle. ""'But I'm not ready to meet him yet!'"" No one can know the ways of the Lord, but we would be surprised if he wasn't happy to meet Dan Inouye today. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Zuckerman and David Gergen.","Michael Zuckerman, David Gergen: Sen. Dan Inouye was a hero from another generation .

"MOSCOW (CNN) -- In his first televised interview since he was launched toward the presidency again, Russia's powerful Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said Monday that his goal of returning to the Kremlin was to ""stabilize"" and ""diversify"" the national economy as well as to ""strengthen the fundamental basis of the political system and the democratic institutions"" of the country. Putin said he ""had never sought this post (the presidency)"" in the first place, but once he accepted his responsibilities, he wanted to continue pulling Russia out of decades of economic and political turbulence following the demise of the Soviet Union. ""If I start something, I either try to complete it, or at least improve things as much as I can,"" he said. He pointed to the examples of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who led the United States as president for four consecutive terms; former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who was in office for 16 years; and post-World War II French and Canadian leaders who served lengthy tenures. However, Putin said that using his political influence he could have easily adjusted the Russian constitution to allow himself another consecutive run after having served two presidential terms from 2000 to 2008, but chose not to do so and stepped down, paving the way for his hand-picked successor, Dmitry Medvedev. Over the past two years, Putin and Medvedev have repeatedly fanned the flames of intrigue by saying in public they would decide together which of them would run for the Russian presidency in 2012. Putin's taped interview was aired Monday on Russia's three national networks -- Channel One, Russia 1 and NTV. Medvedev used exactly the same format on September 30 -- talking to the same interviewees -- to explain that he is ceding his presidential bid to Putin because Putin has higher public opinion ratings, and therefore stronger election chances. But in his Monday interview Putin said he envisioned his return to the country's top job all along. ""Four years ago, we agreed that this scenario was quite possible if we endure this period of fairly serious tests,"" Putin said. ""We decided that if we go through the next four years successfully, then we will have the right to put forward our idea of power configuration to the society: who will do what, what principles we will stick to, and where we will lead our country and our state. ""The moment came and we put it forward,"" he said. ""This is a settled issue for us, but not for our citizens. We proposed this configuration and it's up to the citizens to show at polling stations whether they accept this proposal,"" Putin added. Last month, Medvedev called on the ruling United Russia party to endorse Putin for president in 2012. Putin in turn suggested that Medvedev should take over the role of prime minister if the party wins parliamentary elections in December, in what would be a straight swap of their roles. Under amendments to the constitution that came into force on December 31, 2008, the presidential term was extended to six years. This means that if Putin is elected in March 2012 for six years, he would be eligible to run for another six-year term after that, potentially keeping him in charge until 2024. But in the Monday interview, Putin brushed aside widespread parallels between his future presidency and the rule of old and incompetent Soviet leaders who led the Soviet Union in the 1970s and '80s. ""I cannot recall post-war Soviet leaders working as intensively as I do or as President Dmitry Medvedev does,"" Putin said. ""They (Soviet leaders) were unable, because of their physical condition. ... Perhaps, they could have stirred themselves into action, but the problem was they did not understand what to do. Nor did they have the will to do it,"" he said. Putin said his government, which successfully handled the 2008-2010 world financial crisis, is better than ever prepared for new economic tests. He said that despite the hard times, the Russian economy will grow by 4% this year, and that the annual inflation rate, which now stands at 4.7%, is projected to be the lowest in the past two decades.","Putin says he always envisioned his return to Russia's top job .

"London (CNN) -- The organizers of the 2012 London Olympics have repeatedly asserted the value of the Games in the shape of wider involvement in sport, a lasting legacy of sporting facilities, and increased tourism. But experience from previous Games suggest differently. Not one recent Olympic host nation can point to an increase in sport participation as a result of the Olympics. Many of the stadiums built for the Greek Games are now expensive-to-maintain wrecks. As for tourism, the Olympics generally leads to a decrease in visitor spending, not an increase, as the travel industry has pointed out. Watch how Greece's Olympic dream turns sour . Despite all this, not one politician or sports administrator has come up with a plan for a better Games, an Olympics for all. This is what my book, ""Why The Olympics Aren't Good For Us, And How They Can Be,"" uniquely sets out to do. Let's be clear: I love sport. My book is not anti-Olympics, and I will be caught up in the excitement of the Games once they begin. But I believe the Games could have been organized differently. I am suggesting ""Five New Olympic Rings"" representing five core principles that would draw in the direct participation of the maximum number of people. Otherwise, for most citizens the Games can only be experienced via the remote control from the sofa. They might as well be taking place somewhere else, saving us both the expense and the inconvenience. So let's see what a Games organized under an alternative vision might look like: . Ring One: A decentralized Olympics held all across Britain could have created a local Games for large parts of the population, instead of everything being crammed in to London. I would ditch the idea of a host city, and replace it with a host nation. Ring Two: Spectator attendance could have been boosted by making use of the many existing large stadiums, mainly soccer grounds. Virtually none are being utilized. Centralizing all of the events in London venues with much smaller capacities slashes the audience that can attend and results in increased ticket prices for the few, instead of lowering those prices for the many. Purpose-built stadiums also cost the taxpayer a lot more money. Read what changed the Olympics forever . Ring Three: Significant parts of the Olympic program could have been held outside of stadiums entirely, creating large-scale free-to-watch events. A multi-stage cycling Tour of Britain, a round-Britain yacht race, a canoe marathon, even open water swimming events in the country's lakes and lochs could have been organized. A measure of London 2012's chronic lack of ambition is the abandoning of the original plan for running the marathon through East London, which would have provided spectator space for hundreds of thousands. It has been replaced with four six-mile laps around the center of the city, reducing the potential audience by 75%. Watch how the Olympic legacy impacted Montreal . Ring Four: Preference could have been given to Olympics sports that are universally accessible. The same few countries always win the equestrian, yachting and rowing events while entire continents have never won a single medal in these sports. Substantial investment in specialist training, beyond the means of many countries, is required to take part in these competitions. Compare this with the breadth of countries that have won medals in boxing, football, or middle- and long-distance running. These are sports requiring no expensive kit or facilities, governed by simple rules, with mass appeal. Other sports with likely high participation could be added to the Olympic roster. One of my favourite candidates is the tug-of-war, which last featured at the 1920 Games. Requiring not much more than a sturdy rope, it is easy to train for, the teams could be mixed, and the spectacle could be a real crowd-pleaser. Ring Five: The Olympic symbol could have been used as a symbol for sporting participation rather than as a logo for corporate sponsors. With priorities reversed in this way, the precious Olympics Five Rings could only have been used by voluntary and community groups to promote sport on a not-for-profit basis. Sponsors could have been forbidden any use of the Five Rings. They need sport just as much as sport needs their millions yet the Olympic authorities sell the Games short by meekly complying with the sponsors' ever-escalating demands. Let's not forget the biggest sponsor of all of London 2012: the British taxpayer. I want to build a new Olympics, to take the best of the Games I first fell in love with as a child (I still have the sticker album to prove it). Why, up until now, has no such alternative been even discussed? My book seeks to redress that failure. Let the debate begin. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mark Perryman.","Olympics assert value of Games in terms of sport, legacy of facilities and tourism boost .
Mark Perryman argues this is not true, and proposes improvements to Games .
He proposes decentralizing Games around a nation and more free-to-view events .
Olympic Rings could also be used by charities instead of by sponsors ."
"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama gave a special salute Monday to Americans who lost their lives fighting in the Korean War, noting the upcoming 60th anniversary of the conflict's end, and asked Americans to remember the troops' work in Afghanistan as that war winds down. ""Last Memorial Day, I stood here and spoke about how, for the first time in nine years, Americans were no longer fighting and dying in Iraq. Today, a transition is under way in Afghanistan, and our troops are coming home,"" the president said after laying a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns. ""This time next year, we will mark the final Memorial Day of our war in Afghanistan."" He delivered Memorial Day remarks the week after addressing America's controversial counterterrorism strategies and a rash of sexual assaults in the military that he said could threaten national security. Calling Virginia's Arlington National Cemetery ""a monument to a common thread in the American character,"" Obama asked the audience not to forget the ""men and women who are willing to give their lives and lay down their lives"" for the freedoms the nation enjoys. A serviceman recently wrote the president to say he feared ""our work in Afghanistan is fading from memory,"" Obama said. ""And he's right. As we gather here today, at this very moment, more than 60,000 of our fellow Americans still serve far from home in Afghanistan. They're still going out on patrol, still living in spartan forward operating bases, still risking their lives to carry out their mission. ""And when they give their lives, they are still being laid to rest in cemeteries in the quiet corners across our country, including here in Arlington."" Obama cited a handful of troops by name who were buried at Arlington after making the ultimate sacrifice in Afghanistan: . â€¢ Capt. Sara Cullen, a West Point graduate and Black Hawk helicopter pilot, died after a crash during a training mission near Kandahar. â€¢ Staff Sgt. Frankie Phillips, a combat medic, was killed by a roadside bomb while on patrol. ""He was so humble that his parents never knew how many lives he had saved until soldiers started showing up at his funeral from thousands of miles away,"" Obama said. â€¢ Staff Sgt. Eric Christian served five tours of duty because he felt responsible for his team and ""was determined to finish the mission."" He was killed escorting a U.S. official to meet with Afghan leaders. ""For those of us who bear the solemn responsibility of sending these men and women into harm's way, we know the consequences all too well,"" Obama said. ""I feel it every time I meet a wounded warrior, every time I visit Walter Reed and every time I grieve with a Gold Star family."" Chuck Hagel, a former Army sergeant who volunteered for the Vietnam War and is the first enlisted combat veteran to hold the post of defense secretary, told CNN's Barbara Starr that he remembers soldiers who served alongside him, including a captain who was killed 14 days into his tour. Hagel was next to him when he died, he said. ""Anybody who has ever been in combat remembers the names, remembers the faces, remembers the fun, remembers the uniqueness of every person,"" the defense secretary said. Obama arrived at the cemetery amid a 21-gun salute and was met by Hagel, cemetery Executive Director Kathryn Condon and Maj. Gen. Michael Linnington, commander of the Army's military district of Washington. Linnington escorted the president to the tomb, where Obama laid the wreath and observed a moment of silence before speaking at the Memorial Amphitheater. Home and Away: Remembering those we have lost . The president, who used last year's occasion to pledge his support for Vietnam War veterans, spoke Saturday about the ""1% of the American people (who) bear the burden of our defense."" ""They are heroes, each and every one,"" he said. ""They gave America the most precious thing they had, the last full measure of devotion. And because they did, we are who we are today: a free and prosperous nation, the greatest in the world."" What to know about Memorial Day . He continued, ""They risk their lives, and many give their lives, for something larger than themselves or any of us: the ideals of liberty and justice that make America a beacon of hope for the world. That's been true throughout our history -- from our earliest days, when a tiny band of revolutionaries stood up to an empire, to our 9/11 generation, which continues to serve and sacrifice today."" Obama further urged Americans to ""do more than remember:"" to care for the loved ones the fallen soldiers leave behind; to ensure that veterans have adequate care, jobs and benefits; and to support military missions at home and abroad. By the numbers: Memorial Day and veterans . The speech comes at a time when the administration is dogged by controversy. While facing tough questions about the alleged IRS targeting of conservative groups and his administration's response to the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, Obama also answered questions last week about the use of drones, the closing of the Guantanamo Bay detention center and sexual assault in the military. In a Thursday speech, he said drones are a necessary evil but one that must be used more judiciously as the American security situation evolves. About Gitmo, he said he would push Congress to allow him to shut down ""a facility that should never have been opened."" On Friday, responding to a Defense Department report that the number of cases of unwanted sexual contact had jumped 35% between 2010 and 2012, Obama said the attacks threaten the trust and discipline that is the military's backbone. ""That's why we have to be determined to stop these crimes. Because they have no place in the greatest military on Earth,"" Obama said during remarks at the U.S. Naval Academy.

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- India launched a 37,500-ton indigenous aircraft carrier Monday in its bid to join a select group of nations capable of building such warships. The carrier INS Vikrant, meaning courageous, was unveiled at a shipyard in Kochi in southern India, defense ministry spokesman Sitanshu Kar told CNN. The warship will undergo extensive tests in the next few years before it is commissioned into the navy, he added. The INS Vikrant, which is 260 meter (853 feet) long and 60 meter (196 feet) wide, can carry MiG 29K fighters and light combat aircraft, he said. Only the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia and France have the capability to design and build such warships, Kar said. Monday's launch comes two days after India announced activation of the reactor on its home-built nuclear-powered submarine, in what Prime Minister Manmohan Singh described was ""a giant stride in the progress of our indigenous technological capabilities."" ""It is testimony to the ability of our scientists, technologists and defense personnel to work together for mastering complex technologies in the service of our nation's security,"" Singh said in a message on Saturday after the reactor on board the INS Arihant submarine was activated.

"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- The Japanese government was quick to distance itself from Toru Hashimoto, mayor of Osaka, after his comments on the apparent necessity of ""comfort women"" caused an international storm. Many of his political allies also did the same. The Your party, a center-right political party, which had proposed a tie-up with Hashimoto's Japan Restoration Party ahead of this July's Upper House elections decided against it. The public via opinion polls decried his comments as inappropriate. Hashimoto's political star very suddenly lost its shine. He claims his remarks were misconstrued by the media. But his attempt to clear his name at Tokyo's Foreign Press Club on Monday did little to allay his critics. Rather than apologize for the offense caused, he said in a pre-released statement: ""It is not a fair attitude to blame only Japan, as if the violation of human rights of women by soldiers were a problem unique to the Japanese soldiers."" In the question-and-answer session afterwards, Hashimoto gave another telling insight: ""Most Japanese historians agree there were no historical facts that Japan as a nation committed abduction or trafficking of those women in a systematic manner."" This is a similar line to that taken in a 2007 Cabinet resolution which declared there was no evidence to prove women were coerced into prostitution by the military -- a resolution drawn up during Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's first term in office. The argument runs contrary to the testimonies of hundreds of former comfort women. These days, the government has reverted back to the Kono statement of 1993, which offers a full apology on behalf of the Japanese nation to all former comfort women. Despite this, Koichi Nakano, a political scientist at Tokyo's Sophia University says there is a smoke-and-mirrors element to the government's public relations campaign. ""Shinzo Abe's convictions are very nationalistic,"" Nakano said. ""He wants to turn a new page, he wants to be proud of Japan and he also wants to put an end as he calls it to the post-war regime. He's basically a negationist -- that Japan did nothing particularly wrong. And he's been repeating that, backtracking each time he gets strong criticisms."" For now the prime minister's focus is on improving the Japanese economy. Here, he has the public behind him with over 60% approval ratings. In its latest front cover, The Economist depicts Abe as Superman. The blurb for the article reads: ""Shinzo Abe has a vision of a prosperous and patriotic Japan. The economics looks better than the nationalism."" If he wins the support of the Upper House in July's elections, he could feel empowered to enact the more nationalist agenda, spelt out in his campaign platform including revising the constitution to give the country's self-defense forces the status of a regular army. Some political analysts in Japan say it could extend to reintroducing the notion of patriotism in school textbooks and revising the narrative of imperial Japanese aggression. But Nakano says Abe will also face considerable pushback. ""I think there'll be a tug of war between those who want to reveal their true selves and get back to a revisionist nationalist agenda and those trying to bring Abe back from that direction and persuade him to stay focused on the economy and that would include the American government as well as some more moderate members of the conservative camp."" The United States is certainly watching. In a May report called ""Japan-US relations: Issues for Congress,"" the Congressional Research Service wrote: ""Comments and actions on controversial historical issues by Prime Minister Abe and his cabinet have raised concern that Tokyo could upset regional relations in ways that hurt U.S. interests."" In April, Cabinet members and a huge delegation of politicians visited the Yasukuni shrine, a controversial site, to pay their respects to Japan's war dead. A number of war criminals also have their names on its roster. Each visit by Japanese leaders serves to upset South Korea and China who see the shrine as a symbol of Japan's imperial aggression. Abe did not go, though he did send an offering. In August, the opportunity will present itself again on the commemoration of the end of World War II. Abe has not responded to questions on whether he'll visit the shrine or not. There are many who in the interests of regional security hope that he does not.","Japan government distances itself from Osaka mayor's controversial comments .

"Washington (CNN) -- The acting inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security is investigating the Secret Service prostitution scandal in Colombia, in addition to four congressional committees as well as internal reviews by the agency, the military and the White House. The top legislators on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee said Tuesday they sent a letter to Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan asking for information on the incident last month in Cartagena, Colombia, that has resulted in nine agents resigning or in the process of being forced out. Three other Secret Service agents were cleared of serious misconduct, and the military is investigating the alleged involvement of 12 service members. On Monday, the Homeland Security official announced his separate investigation of the incident, which embarrassed the government and raised questions of a possible security breach before President Barack Obama arrived for the Summit of the Americas. The ""field work is beginning immediately,"" acting Inspector General Charles Edwards said in a statement. Meanwhile, Sullivan faced a pair of deadlines Tuesday to answer dozens of questions about the issue. House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Peter King, R-New York, submitted 50 questions to Sullivan, while House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa and Rep. Elijah Cummings, the panel's ranking Democrat, have 10 questions they wanted answered, including a precise time line of exactly what happened in Cartagena. ""The incident in Cartagena is troubling because Secret Service agents and officers made a range of bad decisions,"" said a letter from Issa, R-California, and Cummings of Maryland. The pair also sent a letter to Defense Secretary Leon Panetta requesting details of the military investigation by May 8. In their correspondence to Panetta, Issa and Cummings said security personnel showed an ""alarming lack"" of ""character"" and ""judgment."" The Senate Judiciary Committee questioned Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano about the controversy at a hearing last week. On Tuesday, Sen. Joe Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut who chairs the Senate Homeland Security Committee, and ranking Republican Sen. Susan Collins said they sent Sullivan a letter Monday that also sought answers about what happened. ""We wish to determine whether those events were indicative of a pattern of behavior by agents or officers of the Secret Service, and need to be addressed systemically, or if they instead constituted an isolated incident warranting action only with respect to the individuals involved,"" said the letter from Lieberman and Collins. The U.S. Southern Command expects to finish questioning the 12 military personnel implicated in possible wrongdoing this week before forwarding its findings to military lawyers for review, and then to Gen. Douglas Fraser, commanding general of the U.S. Southern Command, a Defense Department official said Monday. Last week, the Secret Service distributed new rules for its agents on assignment intended to prevent a repeat of such alleged misconduct, according to two government sources familiar with the resulting investigation. Called Enhanced Standards of Conduct, the new guidelines given to all Secret Service personnel make clear that standards of behavior required in the United States apply on missions abroad, the sources said. Effective immediately, the new standards require detailed briefings before each trip that will include safety precautions and any necessary designations of establishments and areas that are ""off limits"" for Secret Service personnel, the sources said. Also in the new standards, foreigners are banned from Secret Service hotel rooms at all times, except for hotel staff and host nation law enforcement and government officials on official business, according to the officials, and all Secret Service personnel are prohibited from going to a ""nonreputable establishment."" The new standards specify that U.S. laws apply to Secret Service personnel when traveling, rendering invalid the excuse that specific activity is legal in the foreign country, the officials said. In addition, the new guidelines allow moderate alcohol consumption when off duty, but prohibit alcohol consumption within 10 hours of reporting for duty or at any time when at the hotel where the protected official is staying, the officials explained. An additional supervisor from the Office of Professional Responsibility will now accompany the ""jump teams"" that bring vehicles for motorcades and other transportation, the officials said. Agents involved in the Colombia incident were part of such a jump team. Allegations of further transgressions by agents have emerged after the initial reports of heavy drinking and consorting with prostitutes last month before Obama arrived in Cartagena. Recent claims include an account from El Salvador described by CNN affiliate Seatte TV station KIRO as very similar to the Colombia scandal, involving members of the Secret Service and other government agencies. However, Panetta said last week that his department is not investigating any of its troops over the reported incident in El Salvador, while State Department spokesman Victoria Nuland said embassy staff in El Salvador were being questioned about the allegations . The Drug Enforcement Administration also is prepared to look into, ""in an appropriate manner and immediately,"" allegations that it deems ""credible"" regarding its agents in El Salvador, agency spokesman Rusty Payne said. But he added that, while the DEA had seen news reports, ""we are unaware of any allegations of misconduct."" CNN's Ed Payne, Ted Barrett, John King and Dana Bash contributed to this report.","The Homeland Security acting inspector general announces an investigation .

"London (CNN) -- As concerns about rising Islamophobia in Britain grew amid anti-Muslim protests and attacks targeting mosques, authorities made a 10th arrest in last week's knifing death of a British soldier. Armed police arrested a 50-year-old man on a street in the town of Welling in southeastern England. The man's connection to the case was unclear, but like the other nine suspects, he was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder. Three of those arrested are still in custody, including the two men who allegedly hacked to death British soldier Lee Rigby. Two were released without charge, and five were released on bail. Police haven't said how anyone they've arrested could be tied to killing, and they've been tight-lipped about the attackers' identities and their motives. But a video recording of one of the suspected attackers claiming the soldier's death was revenge for the deaths of Muslims worldwide has fueled long-simmering tensions. And the series of arrests after the British soldier's slaying have done nothing to quell surging anti-Muslim sentiment in some sectors of the United Kingdom. A mosque was set ablaze Sunday in Grimsby, a town on England's east coast. Officers arrested two men there on suspicion of arson, according to Humberside county police. No one was injured in the fire. The English Defence League demonstrated in the town's center the morning before the fire. On Monday, hundreds of EDL supporters marched near the central London office of Prime Minister David Cameron. Enraged by the murder of Rigby in the southeast London neighborhood of Woolwich on Wednesday, the EDL has called for marches around the UK. In a demonstration in Newcastle on Saturday, angry supporters cried out for Muslims to leave the country. EDL demonstrators threw objects at counter demonstrators, and police stepped in to keep the raucous men from going after their opponents. The EDL claims Islamic law is poised to overthrow British society and calls for Britons to act aggressively to pre-empt it. ""If we fail to show courage now, we will leave revolution, civil war or subjugation to our children and our children's children,"" reads the motto on the EDL's website. ""Any act of muslim extremism will now be countered by the EDL,"" it vows on its Facebook page. Fear at the mosque . On Friday, members of the Grimsby Islamic Cultural Centre expressed fear on its Facebook page over the EDL's announcement of Saturday's protest. ""Guys can you try to keep as safe as poss as the EDL in Grimsby have planned a few demonstrations in the coming days,"" Nadia Hussein posted. Another poster on the mosque's Facebook page claimed the Grimsby EDL gave out the Islamic center's address. ""Stay safe and Allah be with us all,"" Gayle Hardy added. CNN could not corroborate the claim on EDL Grimsby's Facebook page. Police have not implicated the EDL or any other group in the mosque fire. After the blaze, police said they were aware of online postings ""by a small minority of individuals"" that were intended to ""incite trouble,"" Humberside County police said. ""Those people should be aware that we are monitoring these sites in Humberside and we will take action against those intent on attempting to incite violence or post messages of a racial nature,"" police warned. Reports of anti-Islamic incidents surged after Rigby's gruesome killing, according to Fiyaz Mughal, who operates a hotline for Muslims under attack. In the 48 hours after the murder, he received 162 reports from victims saying people had called them names, assaulted them or thrown things at them. Before the Woolwich killing, Mughal received around five complaints per day. Eight mosques were attacked across the country during that time, he said. Cub scout leader, ex-teacher confronted London terrorist . What is the English Defence League? The EDL sports symbolism that resembles that of neo-fascist groups. Its logo is adorned with red medieval crosses. One of its popular slogans is ""Defender of Faith! Defender of England!"" A motif on some of its sweat shirts is the image of a Christian knight, possibly a Crusader, praying with his sword drawn. Many EDL sympathizers seen at demonstrations have similar appearances to those of right-wing extremist groups. Almost all of them are young, white men. Many of them have shaved heads typical of skinheads and wear nationalist symbols. But the group focuses strictly on Islam. It claims to oppose racism and to promote democracy and diversity. It brags that it has support from gay rights groups, Sikhs and Hindus. The EDL even links to a ""Jewish Division"" on its Facebook page and posts messages of support for people of color it feels have fallen victim to Islamist extremists. Members of the EDL clashed with police near the scene of Ribgy's killing last week. A tweet from its official account proclaimed then that ""it's fair to say that finally the country is waking up!:-) NO SURRENDER!"" Who is the bloody, cleaver-wielding man? Murder sparked outrage . Men in a blue car drove up on a sidewalk Wednesday and struck the 25-year-old Rigby. They got out of the car, according to police, then stabbed and slashed him to death with knives and meat cleavers, before dragging his body into the middle of the street. After the attack, one of the men, his right hand covered in blood, the left brandishing a knife and a cleaver, found someone with a camera and talked into it. He justified the terrible deed as revenge for the killings of Muslims around the world. The video went viral on the Internet. When police arrived, one of the suspects rushed officers with a gun, authorities said. Police opened fire, wounding both of them. Kenya: Before British soldier's slaying, suspect was tied to terror . Extremism task force . Britain is forming a task force that will examine the dynamics behind extremist groups in the country, Prime Minister David Cameron's office announced Sunday. The group, led by Cameron, will ""have a general focus on extremist groups, but accept that in practice the greatest threat is from Islamist extremists,"" a statement from Downing Street said. The Muslim Council of Britain said the task force needs to look at ""extremism from all quarters"" while forming an effective strategy. ""We must be vigilant and ensure we do not inadvertently give into the demands of all extremists: making our society less free, divided and suspicious of each other,"" said a statement from the council's secretary-general, Farooq Murad. ""Lessons from the past indicate that policies and measures taken in haste can exacerbate extremism."" After soldier's slaying, Britain forms extremism task force .

"(CNN) -- ""I'm just gonna put a little more butter in there, y'all,"" she said as she plopped a large chunk into the skillet. ""Oh my,"" she added, ""I've gone and put a whole stick in by now."" I was watching Paula Deen on the Food Network, whipping up a shrimp sautÃ© to go over pasta. I thought to myself, ""I could make a similar dish that would look much better (hers was murky from all the butter), taste much better (fresh, clean flavors from a small amount of extra-virgin olive oil, garlic, dry vermouth and herbs), with a fraction of the fat and calories."" Later that day, I read about Deen's revelation that she had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes three years ago and is now a paid spokeswoman for Novo Nordisk, the pharmaceutical company that supplies her diabetes medication. She says the diagnosis will not change the way she cooks. What a shame! Like many people, Deen has genes that predispose to weight gain, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes when physical activity is insufficient and calories are consumed in excess, especially from quick-digesting carbohydrate foods that cause spikes of blood sugar. Type 2 diabetes is a serious condition that greatly increases risks of cardiovascular disease, disability and premature death. The good news is that many, if not most, cases can be put into remission through lifestyle changes: losing weight, increasing activity and adhering to a low-glycemic-load diet, especially minimizing consumption of flour and sugar. Taking a drug to lower blood sugar without making those lifestyle changes is a classic example of trying to deal with a problem without going to the root of it. (Another is taking a pill to suppress stomach acid so that you can eat foods that cause heartburn without it.) Eatocracy: Hugh Acheson on Southern food beyond the butter . The queen of high-fat, high-calorie ""Southern comfort"" food likes to say that she encourages her followers to practice moderation in eating her rich dishes. How about using her charm and culinary skills to teach them to make healthier versions of those dishes without sacrificing flavor or any of the pleasure of eating? If she doesn't think that's possible, I'd encourage her to eat at one of the True Food Kitchen restaurants in Arizona and California.

"Washington (CNN) -- Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan has cooperated properly with congressional investigators looking into the prostitution scandal in Colombia last month before President Barack Obama's visit, influential House members said Wednesday. Rep. Peter King, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said Sullivan provided answers to 50 questions from his panel about the controversy in Cartagena that embarrassed the nearly 150-year-old agency and raised concerns of a possible security breach. ""I got the answers back last night, and I would say the answers were very detailed,"" King said on CNN's ""Starting Point with Soledad O'Brien."" In addition, King said, Sullivan notified the Homeland Security Department's inspector general when the scandal became public in mid-April, ""which showed that he wanted a real investigation."" Also Wednesday, the House Oversight Committee's leading members said Sullivan provided a ""detailed response"" to their separate list of questions about the incident. ""Director Sullivan's cooperation with our oversight efforts underscores his commitment to understand the extent of the problem and ensure that this unacceptable conduct does not occur again,"" said a statement by the panel's chairman, Darrel Issa, R-California, and ranking Democrat, Elijah Cummings of Maryland. Even Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, a frequent critic of government resistance to congressional oversight, praised Sullivan's response to his request for details of any possible involvement of White House advance team staff in the scandal. Grassley is demanding that the White House turn over all details of an internal review that found no wrongdoing by advance staff members, and he renewed his call Wednesday after receiving Sullivan's response that the Secret Service inquiry didn't involve White House records. ""Since the Secret Service did not request the records of the White House personnel, an open and transparent response from the president's counsel is even more imperative,"" Grassley said in a statement. ""Unfortunately, more than a week after my inquiry, I've yet to hear from anybody at the White House. I appreciate the Secret Service's transparency in response to Congress, even with sensitive information."" King said Tuesday night that Sullivan's answers to his committee's questions disclosed that three of the 12 Secret Service agents involved in the scandal had refused to cooperate with authorities and submit to a polygraph test. The three agents were among the first forced out of the service when news of the scandal in Cartagena broke, King said. The nine remaining agents took polygraph tests, and although none of them failed, some responses led to the loss of several jobs, he added. On Wednesday morning, King said that no security breach occurred from the Secret Service agents consorting with foreign prostitutes in their hotel rooms shortly before Obama's arrival in Cartagena for last month's Summit of the Americas. ""We know that it appears that no material was obtained by any of the prostitutes. Nothing is missing. All the BlackBerrys are accounted for. There was no president's schedule available,"" King said. ""It does not appear that any of the 12 women had any involvement other than prostitution,"" King added. ""They were not working for any narco-terrorist organization, and I think in a way the Secret Service has ducked a bullet."" Still, King said, the incident ""goes against all the principles of the Secret Service."" ""Because it was disclosed and there was no long-term security matter here, it gives the Secret Service the opportunity to clear up what has happened, do all it can to make sure it never happens again or at least minimizes it to make it very, very difficult for it to ever happen again,"" he said. While King did not provide CNN copies of the responses -- which he said are marked ""law enforcement sensitive"" -- he highlighted several details Tuesday night. Among other things, one agent said in the polygraph test that he was ""actively engaged"" with one of the prostitutes when she wanted to get paid, King said. In response, the agent threw her out of his room. The agent told U.S. officials he didn't realize the woman was a prostitute, and he has not been fired. U.S. officials have interviewed 10 of the 12 women involved in the scandal, King noted. The Secret Service and Colombian authorities are trying to track down the remaining two. King said there weren't many surprises in the responses to his questionnaire. ""Sullivan was giving us good information all along,"" he said. The top legislators on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee said Tuesday that they've also sent a letter to Sullivan asking for information on the incident. A total of nine agents have resigned or are in the process of being forced out, while three other Secret Service agents were cleared of serious misconduct. A source familiar with the investigation told CNN on Wednesday that money changed hands between nine Secret Service members and nine prostitutes. The military is investigating the alleged involvement of 12 of its service members. Issa and Cummings also have asked Defense Secretary Leon Panetta to provide details of the military investigation by May 8. Two other congressional committees are looking into the scandal, as well as the Homeland Security inspector general, while the Secret Service and the White House have conducted internal reviews. On Monday, Homeland Security acting Inspector General Charles Edwards announced his investigation of the incident, saying the ""field work is beginning immediately."" The Senate Judiciary Committee questioned Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano about the controversy at a hearing last week. On Tuesday, Sen. Joe Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut who chairs the Senate Homeland Security Committee, and ranking Republican Sen. Susan Collins said they sent Sullivan a letter Monday that also sought answers about what happened. ""We wish to determine whether those events were indicative of a pattern of behavior by agents or officers of the Secret Service and need to be addressed systemically or if they instead constituted an isolated incident warranting action only with respect to the individuals involved,"" said the letter from Lieberman and Collins. The U.S. Southern Command expects to finish questioning the 12 military personnel implicated in possible wrongdoing this week before forwarding its findings to military lawyers for review and then to Gen. Douglas Fraser, commanding general of the U.S. Southern Command, a Defense Department official said Monday. Last week, the Secret Service distributed new rules for its agents on assignment intended to prevent a repeat of such alleged misconduct, according to two government sources familiar with the resulting investigation. Enhanced Standards of Conduct, the new guidelines given to all Secret Service personnel, make clear that standards of behavior required in the United States apply on missions abroad, the sources said. Effective immediately, the new standards require detailed briefings before each trip that will include safety precautions and any necessary designations of establishments and areas that are ""off-limits"" for Secret Service personnel, the sources said. Also in the new standards, foreigners are banned from Secret Service hotel rooms at all times, except for hotel staff and host nation law enforcement and government officials on official business, according to the officials, and all Secret Service personnel are prohibited from going to a ""nonreputable establishment."" The new standards specify that U.S. laws apply to Secret Service personnel when traveling, rendering invalid the excuse that specific activity is legal in the foreign country, the officials said. In addition, the new guidelines allow moderate alcohol consumption when off duty but prohibit alcohol consumption within 10 hours of reporting for duty or at any time when at the hotel where the protected official is staying, the officials explained. An additional supervisor from the Office of Professional Responsibility will now accompany the ""jump teams"" that bring vehicles for motorcades and other transportation, the officials said. Agents involved in the Colombia incident were part of such a jump team. Allegations of further transgressions by agents have emerged after the initial reports of heavy drinking and consorting with prostitutes last month before Obama arrived in Cartagena. Recent claims include an account from El Salvador described by CNN Seattle affiliate KIRO as very similar to the Colombia scandal, involving members of the Secret Service and other government agencies. However, Panetta said last week that his department is not investigating any of its troops over the reported incident in El Salvador, while State Department spokesman Victoria Nuland said Embassy staff in El Salvador were being questioned about the allegations. The Drug Enforcement Administration also is prepared to look into, ""in an appropriate manner and immediately,"" allegations that it deems ""credible"" regarding its agents in El Salvador, spokesman Rusty Payne said. But he added that, while the DEA had seen news reports, ""we are unaware of any allegations of misconduct.""

"(CNN) -- French gangster Redoine Faid, the subject of an international manhunt after his brazen escape from a prison last month, is back in custody, the country's Interior Ministry said Wednesday. Faid held five people, including four guards, at gunpoint at a detention center in the northern city of Lille on April 13, officials said. He then burst his way to freedom, detonating explosives to destroy five doors. Early Wednesday, French police arrested Faid, labeled France's ""public enemy No. 1,"" at a hotel in the Seine-et-Marne region to the east of Paris, the ministry said. Between 70 and 80 police officers took part in the predawn raid, Lille prosecutor Frederic Fevre told reporters. Faid was asleep and offered no resistance when police entered his hotel room. An accomplice was with him in the room and has been taken into custody, Fevre said. Police found one firearm in the room and another in a car parked nearby. During his six weeks on the run, Faid had worn a wig and let his beard grow in order not to be recognized, Fevre said. He'd changed location frequently but has connections in the area where he was caught, the prosecutor said. ""When you are on the run, you need a lot of money and you need to separate yourself from all your close relatives,"" said Fevre. He suggested Faid had failed to meet one or both of these requirements. As well as the jailbreak, Faid is suspected in the murder of a policewoman in 2010 and faces a possible life sentence, Fevre said. However, he won't go back to the Sequedin prison from which he made his audacious escape, Fevre said. The four guards Redoine took hostage in April are still on medical leave, he added. Inspired by the movies . Faid fashioned himself as a modern-day gangster. He thought big -- getting inspiration from the movies, as when he wore a hockey mask like Robert DeNiro's character in ""Heat"" -- and acted boldly, attacking armored trucks among other targets. In his 2010 autobiography, ""Robber: From Suburbs to Organized Crime,"" Faid chronicled his progression from a petty thief to one of France's most notorious criminals. In 1998, after three years on the run during which he fled to Switzerland, Faid was finally caught. Sentenced to 20 years, he ended up spending more than 10 years in high-security prisons around France. After getting out, Faid put himself out there -- not only with his book, but as the subject of numerous interviews. The Frenchman insisted he'd sworn off his wicked ways. This promise didn't last for long. In 2011, Faid landed back behind bars. There he stayed until his dramatic escape last month. Authorities issued a European arrest warrant covering 26 countries, and Interpol worked to track him down as well. On Wednesday, that hunt came to an end. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.","NEW: Faid grew a beard and wore a wig while on the run, prosecutor says .

"Rancho Palos Verdes, California (CNN) -- Google Glass, the wearable technology from the search giant, is gaining a ton of buzz. But Apple CEO Tim Cook is not a huge fan of its potential. ""I think from a mainstream point of view, this is difficult, "" Cook said, referring to whether a lot of people will want to pay $1,500 to buy the product. In recent weeks, Google Glass, a piece of computing hardware wrapped around the face, has been distributed to its first group of beta testers in the real world. Cook noted that he needs glasses to see and questioned whether people would want wearable technology on their faces. ""I don't know a lot of people that wear them (glasses) that don't have to,"" he said. Cook was speaking at the ""All Things D"" technology conference Tuesday evening. The annual event draws hundreds of technology executives from around the world. Questioned by moderators Kara Swisher and Walt Mossberg, who manage the technology blog by the same name, Cook seemed to hint that Apple may someday enter the ""wearables"" market, but declined to be specific. Speculation has been rampant in recent months that Apple might unveil an iWatch. ""I think there are lots of things to solve in this space. It's an area that's ripe for exploration, "" he said. Cook was also questioned about whether Apple is losing its ""cool factor,"" with competitors such as Samsung and HTC getting good reviews for their new phones armed with cutting edge features and larger screens. ""Is Apple in trouble? Absolutely not,"" he said, citing statistics that customers use their Apple products more than the company's competitors. For instance, he said, 59% of smartphone web traffic comes from IOS, the operating system that powers the iPhone. Even so, Android phones are now significantly outselling iPhones worldwide. ""Winning has never been about making the most,"" he said. ""Our north star is always on making the best products.

"(CNN) -- A new SARS-like virus recently found in humans continues to spread -- with the worldwide total now at 49, the World Health Organization said Wednesday. Of the 49 known infections with the MERS-CoV virus, 27 have resulted in death, the organization said. The latest deaths were reported in Saudi Arabia. The Saudi health ministry said Wednesday that three people died from their infections in the country's eastern region. The virus is ""a threat to the entire world,"" the WHO's general director said Monday. 5 things to know about the coronavirus . It ""is not a problem that any single affected country can keep to itself or manage all by itself,"" Margaret Chan said Monday in her closing remarks at the 66th World Assembly in Geneva, Switzerland. Although many of the cases have occurred on the Arabian Peninsula, people have died of the infection elsewhere. However, ""all of the European cases have had a direct or indirect connection to the Middle East,"" the WHO said earlier this month. But ""in France and the United Kingdom, there has been limited local transmission among close contacts who had not been to the Middle East but had been in contact with a traveler recently returned from the Middle East."" On Tuesday, a patient died in France after having contracted the virus during a trip to the Middle East, the WHO reported. Coronaviruses cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, as well as a variety of animal diseases. However, the new virus is not SARS. The WHO recently gave it a more specific name: Middle East respiratory symptom coronavirus, or MERS-CoV. It acts like a cold virus and attacks the respiratory system, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said. But symptoms, which include fever and a cough, are severe and can lead to pneumonia and kidney failure. Health officials do not yet know much about how the virus spreads, which makes it hard for scientists to prevent infections, Chan said.

"(CNN) -- Violence rocked two major Iraqi cities Wednesday, including Baghdad, where a car bombing near a wedding party and two other bombings killed at least 20 people, police said. In Mosul, a Sunni activist known to demonstrate against Iraq's Shiite-led government was assassinated, one of 10 people killed or found dead from acts of violence Wednesday in the northern Iraqi city, Mosul police officials said. The slayings come amid an uptick of political and sectarian violence across Iraq, where more than 350 people died in acts of violence in May, according to a CNN tally. And Wednesday's attacks come on what is becoming an especially deadly week in the country -- at least 110 people have been killed since Monday. In Baghdad, two car bombs and a roadside bomb exploded in separate Sunni neighborhoods in Baghdad within 30 minutes of each other Wednesday evening, police in the Iraqi capital said. One of the car bombs detonated near a wedding party in al-Diwan, a neighborhood in southwestern Baghdad, killing at least 16 people and wounding 42 others, according to police. It wasn't clear whether the wedding party involved Sunnis or Shiites. The other car bomb exploded in a market in the al-Gazaliya neighborhood in western Baghdad, killing four people and wounding 17 others, police said. And in the al-Khadraa neighborhood in western Baghdad, a roadside bomb wounded six people, police said. Meanwhile, Wednesday's killings in Mosul -- about 430 kilometers (265 miles) north of Baghdad -- were another sign of a shaky security situation in Nineveh, the province where Mosul is located and one of three Iraqi provinces that postponed April's provincial council elections until July because of violence. Gunmen fatally shot Sunni activist Sheikh Hassan al-Jabouri with pistols equipped with silencers in central Mosul, a predominantly Sunni city, police said. No suspects have been announced. Al-Jabouri was active in demonstrations demanding that the Shiite-led government stop what protesters call second-class treatment of Iraq's Sunni community. Since December, tens of thousands of such demonstrators have taken to the streets across Iraq. Sunni Arabs had more political clout in Iraq during Saddam Hussein's rule, until his government was deposed in 2003 after the U.S.-led invasion. Under the Shiite-led government in the post-Saddam era, Sunnis have felt marginalized. About two-thirds of Iraq's nearly 32 million people are Shiite and roughly a third are Sunni, according to the CIA World Factbook. Also Wednesday, a suicide attacker detonated a car bomb at a police station in southern Mosul, killing two people and wounding seven others, police said. And the bodies of three people who appeared to have been tortured and hanged were recovered from the Tigris River and sent to the Mosul morgue, police said. The hanging victims appeared to have died Wednesday morning, police said. They have not been identified. Also, Iraqi federal police killed four people in clashes with unspecified gunmen in eastern Mosul, police officials in the city said. The clashes happened after people reported suspicious activity in a building. When police arrived, gunmen emerged and attacked them, the Mosul police officials said. In other violence Wednesday, mortar rounds landed on offices of the Nineveh provincial council in central Mosul, wounding six people, according to police. Wednesday's bloodshed comes amid an increase of violence across Iraq, much of it stemming from discord between Sunni and Shiite Muslims. On Tuesday, at least 23 people were killed and more than 80 others were wounded in three explosions and three shooting incidents in Baghdad and Mosul, police officials said. On Monday, at least 57 people were killed and 190 wounded in a wave of attacks in Baghdad and other cities, police said. READ MORE: Iraq at crossroads as bombs explode .

"(CNN) -- Sometimes a number can put a complicated truth in simple terms. Here's one: 20%. A child whose family budget is controlled by the mother is 20% more likely to survive. Why? Women know what's best for their families. They make health care, nutritious food and education priorities. But most women in developing countries don't control household budgets, and many also don't control the circumstances of their own lives. If women everywhere had the power to determine their futures, the world would be forever transformed. This week I will attend the Women Deliver conference in Kuala Lumpur. I'll be joined by more than 3,000 people who have dedicated their careers to empowering women and girls. The specifics of our work differ, but we're all united by a single, powerful idea: Empowered women and girls will save lives, make families more prosperous and help the poorest countries in the world build stronger economies. Once you have a child, your career is over? Absolutely not . One key to empowerment—and an issue that's a personal priority for me—is letting women decide when to have children. Right now, more than 200 million women around the world say they don't want to have a child but are not using contraceptives. Some of these women will die from complications of pregnancy. Some will give birth to a child who dies. Many mothers who survive (and have children who survive) won't have the resources to feed or educate them. More: CNN's 'Girl Rising' Take, for example, a girl in Niger, where 75% of girls are married before their 18th birthday. Of course, Niger is small and has the highest rate of child marriage in the world, but there are large countries (including Bangladesh, Ethiopia, India and Tanzania, with a total of 1.5 billion people) where more than 40% of girls become brides. What happens to a child bride from one of these countries? If she can't use contraceptives, she gets pregnant, leaves school and probably never goes back. If she continues having children one after the next—""one on the back and one in the belly,"" as women have said to me—her health will deteriorate, along with the health of her babies. By the time her children are school age, they are likely to be malnourished and stunted, so even if they go to school, they won't be ready to learn. Unfortunately, there's a real probability that this very same cycle will start again. However, if these girls don't get pregnant and are able to stay in school, everything changes. They will be healthier. Their children will be healthier. Because they finished their schooling, they will be able to earn more money. That money will stretch further, because they will be supporting a smaller family. Their children will be set up to lead a better life than they did, which is the goal of every parent I know. More: Christiane Amanpour's open letter to girls of the world . Last year, at the London Family Planning Summit, the world came together on a goal to reach 120 million more women and girls around the world with the family planning options they want for their families. Since then, almost two dozen countries have developed plans to make sure women have access to contraceptives. Family planning is just the start. Women who have the power to decide when to get pregnant also must have the power to vaccinate their children, feed them healthy food and pay their school fees. Each of these things is a link in a chain of good health and prosperity. Take agriculture. The vast majority of the world's poorest people farm small plots of land to grow their food and earn an income. Women do the majority of the agricultural work across Africa and South Asia, but they don't have equal access to information and farm supplies. As a result, plots of land worked by women generate lower yields than plots worked by men—as much as 40% lower. If women can get the right training, high-quality seeds and access to irrigation and fertilizer, they will be able to grow more and more nutritious food while producing a surplus they can sell for a profit. Those are resources they can convert into a better life for their children. Women Deliver is organized around the conviction that women and girls can start a virtuous cycle of development. They just need a little support to get it started. They need to be able to plan their pregnancies. They need to be able to grow enough food to support their families. Once these basics are in place, the only limit is women's ambition for the future. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Melinda Gates.","Melinda Gates: In developing world most women don't control home budgets, reproduction .

"Washington (CNN) -- Nearly 70% of guns recovered from Mexican criminal activity during the past five years and traced by the U.S. government originated from sales in the United States, according to data released Thursday by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. All the guns that were traced were passed to the U.S. from Mexican authorities. ATF Special Agent John Hageman was careful in his comments as he released the data. ""Our job is to provide the aggregate tracing figures and not to speculate,"" he said. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, cautioned against reading too much into the statistics beyond that ""most of these guns can't be traced to U.S. gun dealers"" and some could be tied to ""the federal government's own gun-walking scandal."" ""We also have to remember that the only guns Mexico is going to submit for tracing are guns they know are from the United States, which clearly paints an incomplete picture of the firearms found in Mexico,"" he said in a statement. But anti-gun advocates were not so restrained. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, a leading gun-control voice on Capitol Hill, said the figures are evidence of the need for stricter gun laws. Some likeminded legislators claim that the National Rifle Association and the gun industry have downplayed the degree to which U.S. gun sales are responsible for weapons used by Mexican drug cartels and other violent criminals south of the border. The newly released data show that from 2007 to 2011 in Mexico City, the ATF traced 99,691 firearms from their manufacture to the retail point of sale. Of those weapons, 68,161 were U.S.-sourced weapons, the ATF said. Hageman said a significant trend over the past five years has been an increase in rifles among firearms that Mexico asked the ATF to trace. ""Law enforcement in Mexico now report that certain types of rifles, such as the AK and AR variants with detachable magazines, are used more frequently to commit violent crime by drug trafficking organizations."" Both the Bush and Obama administrations have been strong supporters of President Felipe Calderon's efforts to control drug cartels along the U.S.-Mexico border, and both governments have made efforts to try to curtail the illegal movement of firearms across the border to Mexico. One operation, code-named Fast and Furious, went awry when hundreds of illegally purchased weapons, which were supposed to be tracked, got lost after they crossed the border. Two of the missing guns were found at the scene of the murder of Border Patrol agent Brian Terry in Arizona, resulting in a wave of criticism of the ATF and its parent agency, the Justice Department.","NEW: Sen.

"Washington (CNN) -- Congressional negotiators reached a tentative deal Tuesday to extend the payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits while avoiding a fee cut for Medicare doctors, according to Republican legislators and aides. The framework deal followed a key Republican concession Monday and could receive the endorsement of a House-Senate conference committee on Wednesday. Reps. Renee Ellmers of North Carolina and Fred Upton of Michigan, both Republicans who were part of the conference committee negotiations, called it a tentative agreement, while a top House Democratic aide said Democratic leaders would discuss the proposal with their members on Wednesday morning. Ellmers and Upton said they expected the conference committee to sign off on the measure Wednesday if no objections arise. In that case, the House would vote on the agreement, in the form of the conference committee report, as soon as Friday. However, some conservative House Republicans expressed concerns about the potential agreement and said they were unsure if they would support it. Other GOP House legislators said they expected it to pass with support from a majority of Republicans, as well as Democrats. ""It's the art of a deal. I mean, it's a compromise,"" said Rep. Steve Latourette, R-Ohio. ""So you have people that didn't get a 100% of what they wanted."" Under the agreement that would cover the rest of 2012, the nearly $100 billion payroll tax cut would not be paid for -- a consequence of the parties' inability to compromise on either new taxes or offsetting spending cuts, said top congressional aides from both parties. It would be coupled, however, with measures extending unemployment benefits and preventing a fee cut to Medicare doctors -- known in Washington as the ""doc fix."" The latter two measures -- costing a combined $50 billion -- would be paid for, the aides said. Possible funding sources to pay for the measure include saving from broadband spectrum sales of about $13 billion, increased pension contributions by federal employees of about $16 billion and cuts to Medicare hospital and specialist fees that would not impact patients, according to the congressional aides. ""I think they have to work out all the details, but I think the big scope has been agreed to,"" House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, told reporters. However, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, was less enthusiastic, saying ""this is not our preferred way"" to deal with the issues and adding that details were still being studied. Congressional aides differed by party on details of extending the unemployment benefits, particularly the maximum number of weeks that will be funded. While a Democratic aide said the maximum for states with high unemployment would continue at the current 99 weeks, a Republican aide said the maximum would be 89 weeks and most states would have a maximum of 63 weeks of benefits by the end of the year. Some Republicans wanted unemployed individuals to pass drug tests and meet certain education standards before getting benefits -- an idea generally opposed by Democrats. A top Republican aide said the tentative agreement would allow for states to conduct drug testing when the unemployment benefits applicant was seeking a job that required drug testing or lost a job due to a failed drug test. News of the tentative deal came hours after President Barack Obama publicly urged Congress to extend the payroll tax cut, which is currently set to expire at the end of February. Failure to do so, Obama warned, could derail the economic recovery. ""This is a make-or-break moment for the middle class,"" the president said. ""The last thing we need is for Washington to stand in the way of America's comeback."" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney later told reporters that the payroll tax cut, extension of unemployment benefits and ""doc fix"" provision all were ""important to the economy in different ways."" ""It is of vital importance that Congress not muck up the recovery that we're seeing under way,"" Carney said of the need for a broad agreement. The payroll tax cut, unemployment benefits and enhanced ""doc fix"" payments are set to expire at the end of February under a short-term agreement reached by Congress in December. That agreement also set up the conference committee that resumed negotiations last month on a longer-term deal. Final negotiations have been hammered out by the two committee chairman, Democratic Sen. Max Baucus of Montana and Republican Rep. Dave Camp of Michigan, in conjunction with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, and Boehner. The payroll tax cut, a key part of Obama's economic recovery plan, has reduced how much 160 million American workers pay into Social Security on their first $110,100 in wages. Instead of paying in 6.2%, they've been paying 4.2% for the past year and two months. The break is worth about $83 a month for someone making $50,000. On Monday, House GOP leaders dropped their demand that any extension of the tax cut be offset by spending cuts elsewhere in the budget. The decision was a sharp turnaround for House Republicans, who previously argued that a failure to fully pay for the tax break would be financially reckless. The debate over whether and how to extend the tax cut has been a political loser so far for the Republicans, who had publicly questioned its value last year. Democrats have gleefully highlighted the GOP's reluctance, using the issue to portray Republicans as defenders of the rich who are indifferent to the plight of the middle class. Political analysts believe the showdown over the payroll holiday has eroded GOP strength on the party's core issue of lower taxes. Fearing negative repercussions, Republican leaders have now backtracked on the issue twice: dropping their opposition to the two-month extension last December and dropping their insistence on paying for a longer extension on Monday. ""I think the GOP has read the writing on the wall when it comes to the payroll tax cut,"" said Brown University political scientist Wendy Schiller. ""Americans are benefiting from it, and to take it away at this juncture leaves them open to charges of raising taxes. ... It would severely hamper the GOP presidential nominee's effort to defeat Obama."" Johns Hopkins University political scientist Adam Sheingate called the GOP's latest move ""a subtle shift in strategy precipitated by the improving economic outlook of the past few weeks."" ""By agreeing to a deal, the GOP can claim some credit for extending the holiday,"" Sheingate said. ""Failing to extend the payroll tax would not only be unpopular, it would shift some of the responsibility for the economy back on the Republicans. This is to be avoided at all costs since the GOP (election) strategy rests almost entirely on Obama's handling of the economy."" In announcing their shift on the payroll tax issue Monday, Boehner and two other top House GOP leaders said they wanted separate the matter from legislation dealing with unemployment benefits and the doc fix. Doing so would ""protect small businesses and our economy from the consequences of Washington Democrats' political games,"" said Boehner, Cantor and House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, R-California. Schiller told CNN the idea of divorcing the payroll tax cut from an unemployment benefits extension and the doc fix was a ""clever"" idea on the part of the House GOP leadership. Doing so would have removed the Democrats' ""leverage on the other issues of unemployment and Medicare payments,"" she said. ""Also, as the unemployment numbers get better, the rationale for a lengthy extension of benefits diminishes. The longer the GOP can stall on the unemployment extension, the more likely it is they win in terms of authorizing a much shorter extension than the Democrats would like."" Democrats, however, quickly pushed back hard against the idea. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, on Tuesday urged Republicans to allow Congress to quickly complete its work on all three issues -- the payroll tax cut, unemployment insurance, and the doc fix. Pelosi said Congress should cancel a recess currently scheduled for next week if it fails to complete work on all of them by Friday. ""These crucial policies affect millions of middle class families and seniors and must not expire at the end of this month,"" Pelosi said. Instead of a separate measure involving only the payroll tax cut extension, the tentative agreement Tuesday was a more comprehensive package worked out by the conference committee negotiators . It remains unclear if the increasingly conservative House GOP caucus will be willing to go along with the tentative deal. House Republican freshmen, elected on a tidal wave of tea party support in 2010, have made deficit reduction their top priority and repeatedly insisted that any new initiatives be fully paid for. Rep. Dennis Ross, R-Florida, said discussion Tuesday night in the House Republican caucus was ""heated"" over not paying for the payroll tax cut extension, which he called ""bad policy,"" while fellow Floridian Rep. Allen West, a tea party conservative, said ""this doesn't look like a good deal to me."" Meanwhile, two New York Republicans, Reps. Tom Reed and Peter King, sounded more supportive, with King saying he expected the measure to pass. One key conservative, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, indicated Tuesday he's prepared to back Boehner and the other House GOP leaders. Jordan's ""view is anytime we're letting people keep more of their money, that's a good thing,"" said Brian Straessle, a spokesman for the Republican congressman. Veteran political analyst Norm Ornstein warned that the GOP leadership's repeated maneuvering on the issue could end up backfiring. House Republican leaders have been ""trying to make the best of crummy situation,"" Ornstein told CNN. But tea party Republicans ""don't care"" if fighting the tax cut extension is ""a political loser. They don't like the payroll tax cut and now the (leadership's) sin is being compounded by saying they won't pay for it."" This ""could play out in ways that make the life of Boehner (and other Republican leaders) a little less comfortable,"" he predicted.

"(CNN) -- Turkey and Syria are locked in a fierce struggle that has escalated greatly following Friday's downing of a Turkish Phantom F-4 jet by the Syrian authorities. The two heavily armed neighbors are inching gradually into a military confrontation, one that is unlikely to be isolated and that has the potential to turn into a region-wide conflict. Consequently it could take just one spark -- an incident such as this -- to ignite a fire between Ankara and Damascus, the flames of which could enflame the entire region. At this particular juncture Turkey is refraining from taking any military measures against Syria. In Tuesday's speech to the Turkish parliament, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan stressed that his country was adopting a ""common-sense"" attitude that ""should not be perceived as a weakness"". Turkey's new approcah relies on active diplomacy, potent economic sanctions and pschological warfare, and the mobilization of both NATO and the western powers, in an effort to isolate the Assad regime further. Security Clearance: Can Turkey force U.S., NATO to attack Syria? It is worth noting that NATO members and EU foreign ministers have called on Turkey to show restraint and avoid action that could escalate into war. ""Military intervention in Syria is out of the question,"" said the Dutch Foreign Miister Uris Rosenthal. However, Erdogan stressed that ""the rules of engagement of the Turkish Armed Forces have changed."" He stated that any advance by Syrian forces toward the Turkish border would be seen as a threat and ""treated as a military target."" What this really means is that Turkey is establishing a de facto safe zone that hinders Syria's ability to move troops close to the border. This will allow the Syrian rebels to gather strength in that the border area and advance toward the Syrian heartlands. PM Erdogan of course spoke carefully in his speech on Tuesday: he stressed that his country talks softly but warned that Turkey's ""wrath is fierce and intense when it needs to be"". There is no mistaking the implied threat: the de factor safe zone means Turkey would not allow Syrian forces near border, thus allowing the rebels a free movement there. So while Turkey is not threatening to launch a pre-emptive attack on the Assad regime it is certainly taking indirect steps to support the Syrian rebels. Recent reports claim that Turkey, along with Saudi Arabia and Qatar, is channeling arms to Syrian rebels with America's implicit consent, though Ankara denies that it is doing so. Turning to the actual attack on the Turkish jet, much remains unclear. We don't know how long it was in Syrian territory for. And was it an innocent mistake on the part of the pilots, or was the plane on a surveillance mission to monitor developments inside Syria? The Turkish authorities refute such claims, and say the jet was testing Turkey's own radar capabilities. On the other hand, Syria acknowledges shooting down the jet, but says the downing of the ""unidentitifed object"" was not an attack. The Syrian government is trying to de-escalate the crisis by saying it did not know it was Turkish, and was merely defending its territory and not acting aggressively. ""We had to react immediately, even if the plane was Syrian we would have shot it down,"" said foreign ministry spokesman Jihad Makdisi at a press conference in Damascus. ""The Syrian response was an act of defense of our sovereignty carried out by anti-aircraft machine gun which has a maximum range of 2.5 km."" But in its letter to the United Nations Security Council, Turkey says that intercepted radio communication shows that Syrian units were fully aware of the circumstances of the flight and that Syria knew exactly who the plane belonged to. By downing the reconnaissance aircraft, Syria is trying to send a message to Turkey -- and the world beyond that is supporting the rebels: Be wary: this is not Libya and we have the military capability and the will to oppose and resist any foreign intervention. Erdogan's announcement signals a subtle and important shift in Ankara's response to the Syrian crisis, in terms not only of political, economic and psychological pressure on President Bashar al-Assad, but also in creating this de facto safe zone that could in theory be enlarged into a base to provide strategic depth for rebels and allow more defectors to enter. Syria is flexing its muscles, and even though Turkey is not retaliating militarily, its actions could be a game-changer within Syria, and between the two countries that were once close allies. The opinions expressed here are solely those of Fawaz A. Gerges .","Tensions between Turkey and Syria rise over shooting down of Turkish military jet .

"Washington (CNN) -- The top Republican on the House Oversight Committee is moving to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress for failing to cooperate in the panel's investigation of the controversial ""Operation Fast and Furious"" weapons sting. Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, sent a 17-page memo and a draft contempt resolution to members of his committee Thursday, outlining what he argued was Justice Department's ""refusal"" to comply with the panel's probe to get information about the sting. The program, run by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, allowed weapons to be purchased illegally in order to track them to senior drug cartel members, but agents lost track of hundreds of weapons in the process. Issa indicated the committee may vote on the measure in an upcoming session, setting up a major confrontation between the Republican-led House and the Obama administration. The Justice Department firmly rejected the committee's publicly released document. In a letter to Issa, Deputy Attorney General James Cole wrote that the department hopes to find a ""mutually acceptable resolution"" to demands for documents, but Issa's resolution ""appears to express a preference for confrontation over resolution."" ""Viewed fairly, the disagreements between the Committee and the Department over the scope of the document to be produced stem not from a lack of cooperation, but from our sincere and unwavering believe that disclosure of materials related to ongoing criminal investigations and prosecutions could well jeopardize our core law enforcement mission, which must remain free from political pressure or even the appearance of political pressure,"" he wrote. ""This is not a novel concept. Cole told Issa the department has handed over 7,600 pages of material related to the botched probe, and Holder has testified about the issue seven times. But he said the committee needs to better define the types of documents it wants Justice to hand over. When word leaked last week that Issa was working on such a resolution, the committee's top Democrat, Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland, sent the chairman a letter accusing him of pressing the issue for political purposes. ""Holding someone in contempt of Congress is one of the most serious and formal actions our committee can take, and it should not be used as a political tool to generate press as part of an election-year witch hunt against the Obama administration,"" Cummings wrote. But in a Thursday interview on Fox News, Issa said, ""We're running out of patience."" He accused the Justice Department of a ""coverup,"" but indicated he was still giving the department a chance to hand over the materials. ""If they don't, then I have the support of leadership to do what we have to do,"" Issa said. If the Oversight Committee approves a contempt resolution, the measure could then go to the House floor for a full vote. But CNN has been told that Issa has no firm plans yet to hold a committee vote, hoping instead that the threat will pressure Holder to provide the documents the Republicans want. ""While there are very legitimate arguments to be made in favor of such an action, no final decision has been made about moving forward yet by GOP leaders,"" a senior House GOP leadership aide said when asked about the timing of a potential vote in the House on the matter. Last week, House Speaker John Boehner deflected questions on any vote, deferring to Issa's investigation. ""I continue to support their efforts and believe that this Justice Department must be held accountable,"" Boehner said. In an effort to paint Issa's efforts as politically motivated, a Democratic government source noted that Issa and other GOP lawmakers protested when the House voted to hold Bush administration officials in contempt in 2008. But an Issa aide said the two issues are completely different: The 2008 dispute involved officials who worked in the White House and claimed executive privilege, the aide said, while Issa is seeking information from an agency over which Congress has oversight. The committee memo accuses the Justice Department of ""reckless conduct"" and notes that it has pressed the department for answers for more than a year about the operation and how it related to the death of Border Control Agent Brian Terry in 2010. Terry was shot near the Arizona border by an illegal immigrant. Two AK-47s recovered at the scene were traced back to a database of weapons bought by a straw purchaser and then smuggled into Mexico in an operation that resulted in the loss of hundreds of weapons. After Terry's death, the Justice Department initially denied allegations in a letter to Congress that it was illegally allowing the flow of weapons to members of Mexican drug rings. But it acknowledged the program about a year later, calling it ""fundamentally flawed."" Holder has since vowed that guns will not be allowed to ""walk"" from gun shops near the border with Mexico. In February, Holder told Congress the Justice Department was still doing its internal inquiry, but stated that officials could be fired for improper conduct. ""I can assure you those people will be removed from federal service,"" he vowed. Issa's memo notes that while the Justice Department has provided some materials to Capitol Hill, most of the information about ""Fast and Furious"" came though whistle-blowers and media reports. The Oversight Committee approved a subpoena sent to Holder in October 2011 with 22 categories of documents it wanted to see, but the committee says it has only received materials relating to 12 of those categories. ""For over a year, the department has issued false denials, given answers intended to misdirect investigators, sought to intimidate witnesses, unlawfully withheld subpoenaed documents, and waited to be confronted with indisputable evidence before acknowledging uncomfortable facts,"" the memo states. Cole said Justice has provided more documents to its Inspector General's office, which is conducting its own investigation of ""Fast and Furious."" And cited internal legal opinions dating back to the Reagan administration to argue against disclosing some documents to Congress. Specifically, the committee is pressing for documents that shed light on why the Justice Department first denied and then acknowledged the program. It also wants more information on which senior Justice Department officials knew about the operation and who approved it, as well as why the various law enforcement agencies allegedly failed to communicate with each other about the operation. Issa's committee has been holding a joint investigation with the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa. Grassley said he supported Issa's move to press for a contempt resolution, and urged the Justice Department to ""come clean."" ""The attorney general and the Justice Department are thumbing their nose at the constitutional authority provided to the legislative branch to conduct oversight,"" Grassley said in a written statement. The controversy over the operation has prompted some GOP members on the Hill to call for Holder's resignation, and more than 100 House Republicans signed onto a resolution of ""no confidence"" against the attorney general -- a largely symbolic gesture that is less serious than a contempt resolution.","NEW: Justice says it has cooperated extensively with ""Fast and Furious"" probe .

"(CNN) -- The luck of the Irish may not be enough to push ahead special legislation introduced by Sen. Scott Brown, R-Massachusetts, to grant 10,500 special work visas for Irish immigrants. Brown proposed the legislation in the midst of a neck-and-neck re-election battle in Massachusetts, which has the highest percentage of Americans of Irish descent. Brown is serving out the term of the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, who was extremely popular with Irish-Americans because of his work on the Irish peace process. Brown has predicted that his legislation would ""pop"" soon, in plenty of time for St. Patrick's Day marches that are magnets for Northeast politicians. ""The Irish economy crashed in 2008. People have come and overstayed visas. The Irish-American vote here is substantial,"" said Hugh Meehan, an Irish-American businessman in Boston. ""This would be welcome relief and a recognition of the strong ties between Massachusetts and Ireland."" But Numbers USA, a conservative organization that supports reducing immigration, is lobbying hard against the bill, questioning why the United States would bring in skilled foreign workers to compete with U.S. citizens in the midst of a recession. Roy Beck of Numbers USA called Brown's bill an election-year ploy to gain favoritism for one ethnic group. ""What about Mexicans? What about Asians and Africans?"" he said. ""There is no reason why we should give this privilege."" The unemployment rate in Massachusetts, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, is 6.9%. The unemployment rate in Ireland is 14.2%. The renewable visas Brown's legislation seeks would expire every two years. The bill is also opposed by the Federation for American Immigration Reform, an organization that typically sides with Republicans on immigration issues. It derided Brown's proposal as a throwback to the days when immigration was based on national origin. In addition, America's Voice, which calls itself non-partisan organization, said that while it supports reform of immigration laws it has called into question the motivations behind giving a special visa status to Irish nationals. On illegal immigration issues, which largely affect immigrants from Central and South America, Brown has been in line with his party. He has spoken against creating magnets for illegal immigration and has opposed the DREAM Act, which would grant permanent residency to college graduates who entered the United States illegally as children. But, in an e-mail statement to CNN, Brown's office said his E3 visa legislation was different. ""For decades, the Irish have been unfairly shut out by our immigration laws. In an effort to increase visa prospects and maintain the close bond between the United States and Ireland, Sen. Brown is working in a bipartisan way to add the Irish E3 program to larger, House-passed visa legislation that benefits several other countries."" In a recent editorial, the Boston Globe said Irish immigrants have already been given ample favoritism. ""Brown argues that Ireland deserves special visas because changes in U.S. immigration policy have disproportionately limited the numbers of Irish workers for decades. But Ireland has often benefited from temporary exemptions. In 1986, Rep. Brian J. Donnelly, a Massachusetts Democrat, pushed for a visa lottery that awarded 4,161 visas to Irish applicants out of the first 10,000. In the 1990s, Rep. Bruce Morrison, a Connecticut Democrat, created a program that gave out 120,000 green cards -- 48,000 reserved for Irish applicants, whose undocumented immigrants had been left out of an earlier amnesty program."" Brown's Democratic opponent, Elizabeth Warren, said the visa system is badly broken. ""We need to reform the visa system for talented Irish men and women coming to this country, and more generally we need to reform the visa system as a whole,"" she said. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York, introduced legislation in the House in November that would eliminate per-country caps for employment-based immigration applications from countries with large backlogs like China and India. It would also grant visa waivers to undocumented Irish immigrants, a move widely unpopular with Republicans. Brown's standalone Senate bill on E3 visas for the Irish, S.2005, followed in December with no provision for undocumented immigrants. Brown's bill was added to Schumer's broader proposal, which eliminated the provision for undocumented immigrants. But Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, placed a hold on this bill when it came over to the Senate. Beth Levine, communications director for Grassley, said he has now extended an offer to move the Brown bill forward. ""An up or down vote on Sen. Brown's Irish visa bill would be acceptable to Sen. Grassley with some modifications dealing with the skill level of those receiving an E3 visa, the current visa program the visas would be allotted from, and the inclusion of a sunset on the program,"" Levine wrote in an e-mail. ""Sen. Grassley's staff is still discussing modifications with the sponsors of the bill.""","Sen. Scott Brown backs bill for 10,500 special work visas for the Irish .

"(CNN) -- Ferrari have absolved driver Felipe Massa from any blame after he crashed out of the Monaco Grand Prix, saying the collision was caused by car failure. The Brazilian, who suffered serious head injuries in an incident at the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix, crashed twice in two days at Monte Carlo's demanding street circuit. When Massa collided with the barriers at the first corner during final practice on Saturday, Ferrari blamed the accident on driver error. The damage to the car was so significant that Massa had to sit out qualifying because the Ferrari mechanics could not mend his scarlet racer in time. During Sunday's race, Massa had worked his way up from the back of the grid when he was taken out by a spookily similar accident at the same St Devote corner. ""After an initial evaluation carried out on based on telemetry data, the engineers looked at all the components of Massa's car, especially those that sustained damage in the heavy impact when the car crashed on lap 29 of the race,"" explained Ferrari after carrying out an nvestigation at their Maranello headquarters. ""The findings validated the first impressions of the engineers, confirming that the accident was caused by an element of the front left suspension breaking."" Massa was attended to by medical staff on the side of the circuit before being taken for a full check-up. ""I was taken to hospital for all the precautionary checks and luckily everything is in order,"" said Massa. ""I'm all right, I've just got a slight pain in my neck, but nothing serious. Now I will look to get in shape and be back 100% for the Montreal race,"" added the Brazilian, referring to the Canadian GP. ""All I want to do is put this bad weekend behind me and think about doing well in the rest of the season."" Massa sat out the second half of the 2009 Formula One season after he fractured his skull and was put into an induced coma following a freak accident during qualifying for the Hungarian Grand Prix. He was hit on the helmet by a spring that had fallen off Rubens Barrichello's Brawn GP car and plunged at high-speed into the barriers. Any subsequent incident involving Massa has an extra poignancy following the 2009 trauma, which sent shockwaves through the close-knit F1 paddock. ""The best news to come out of the Monaco weekend is that Felipe is fine,"" said Ferrari team boss Stefano Domenicali. ""Two big accidents, just over 24 hours apart and all he has to show for it is a bit of muscle pain. Fortunately there were no other injuries."" Ferrari's championship contender Fernando Alonso, who won the previous race in Spain, had a subdued weekend in Monaco, finishing seventh after a difficult race in the principality. The Spaniard retained third place in the drivers' championship but he has now fallen 29 points behind Red Bull's leader Sebastian Vettel and is eight points adrift of Lotus driver Kimi Raikkonen after six events in the 19-race season. The season resumes in Canada next month and Domenicali said the team were steeling themselves for a season of ups and downs. ""This championship seems to be a real rollercoaster of emotions,"" commented Domenicali. ""Following on from a good weekend comes a bad one. ""From now on, it will be important to establish a consistent level of performance. The championship standings are very close and the number of strong opponents is ever increasing. ""It's a scenario in which each point is precious and each hundredth of performance becomes important and obviously we are well aware that one less reliability problem can be very significant in terms of how the championship pans out. ""We have a lot of work to do in the coming days to be as well prepared as possible for Montreal."" Meanwhile former Toyota and Sauber driver Kamui Kobayashi got behind the wheel of a Ferrari F1 car for the first time on Monday. The Japanese driver, who lost his Sauber seat at the end of 2012, is now part of the ""Ferrari family"" and will drive the 2010 F1 car at a demonstration event in Russia, as well as racing in the World Endurance Championship for the Italian marque.","Broken suspension caused Felipe Massa to crash in Monaco Grand Prix .
