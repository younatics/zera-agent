"Large parts of Brisbane city are in lockdown and world leaders have begun arriving in the Queensland capital ahead of this weekend's G20 summit. British Prime Minister David Cameron, South Korean President Park Geun-hye, Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff and South Africa's President Jacob Zuma are among the first world leaders to arrive in the country for the talk-fest. But behind all the handshakes, motorcades and stepped-up security measures, what is the G20 all about? Scroll down for video . Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott shakes hands with UK Prime Minister David Cameron after speaking at an infrastructure business breakfast at the Barangaroo Delivery Authority in Sydney on  Friday . Visitors pose for photos in front of a Brisbane artwork along the river bank  ahead of the G20 Summit . The Lowy Institiute's director of G20 Studies, Mike Callaghan, says it's the most important economic meeting ever had in Australia. 'It is a meeting of the leaders from the largest economies in the world,' Mr Callaghan said. 'It focuses on what each country should do to try and improve their growth and create more jobs, on the basis that if everyone moves together you'll get a better outcome.' But Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott is expected to come under pressure to address other issues such as climate change, following major commitments from the US and China to slash emissions, and Ebola, with British Prime Minister David Cameron to press for a more committed response to combating the disease. ECONOMIC GROWTH . The main game for this weekend's summit is to boost global economic growth. In February, the G20 finance ministers came together and agreed that each country would make a plan to boost global growth by 2 percent by 2018. South Africa's President Jacob Zuma (left) arrives at Brisbane Airport to attend the G20 Summit in Brisbane . Police patrol a walkway along the Brisbane River ahead of the G20 conference on Thursday . Since then, each country has been coming up with an individual action plan to contribute to realising this goal, which they will present to other leaders at the summit. AVOIDING ANOTHER FINANCIAL CRISIS . Monash University political science expert Zareh Ghazarian says the target of this year's G20 is to strengthen the global economy so countries will be more insulated should another financial crisis hit. 'They'll be talking about infrastructure, bridge building and road building,' Dr Ghazarian said. 'Really traditional economics, because those are the things that employ people and when people are employed you have a stronger economy.' Dr Ghazarian said the Brisbane summit would be a very 'nuts and bolts' type of summit. 'It will look at the workings of economies and how to strengthen them,' he said. 'We're not going to see grand plans, I don't think there will be the ""Brisbane Agreement"" or anything.' Brazil's President Dilma Rousseff (right) emerges from her plane after arriving for the G20 Leader's Summit . Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz (centre) is greeted by dignitaries after arriving in Brisbane . TAX DODGING . Also on the agenda will be tax avoidance by multinational corporations. 'There's the OECD/G20 action plan, looking at trying to plug the loopholes in the laws so that companies can't use devices to shift profits to lower or no tax jurisdictions,' Mr Callaghan said. 'TOO BIG TO FAIL' BANKS . Mr Callaghan said the long-running issue of financial regulation will also be on the table. 'One of the big things that they will be trying to come up with is an agreement trying to stop the ""too big to fail"" banks from needing governments to put money into them,' he said. 'These big banks have to have more of their own capital so if they get into problems they won't have to rely on the taxpayer bailing them out.' HISTORY OF THE G20 . Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott is determined to keep the focus on economics, despite pressure to address issues like climate change and Ebola. Historically, the G20 has always had a fiscal focus. It started in 1997 as an annual meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors in response to the Asian financial crisis. But in November 2008, following the global financial crisis, there was recognition that economic issues had the potential to drag the entire world down so it was agreed that world leaders should also attend. EBOLA, ISIS AND CLIMATE CHANGE . Mr Callaghan says so-called side issues - like climate change, ISIS and the fallout from MH17 - still have an economic impact and will likely be addressed. Police officers patrol around a fence near the Brisbane Convention and Exhibition Centre on Thursday . 'The rising tensions like what's happening the Ukraine, or in Syria and Iraq, they do impact on the world economy,' he said. 'The International Monetary Fund revised down its forecast for global growth next year because of these rising geopolitical tensions. 'The G20 isn't the UN and it doesn't come up with or negotiate big peace settlements or emissions targets. 'But leaders can have a frank discussion about those issues and provide some political leadership and momentum towards dealing with then.'

Mr Cameron arrived in Australia overnight ahead of the G20 . AWKWARD FOR ABBOTT . There will be a main meeting – otherwise known as a plenary session – attended by all leaders where they will follow a fixed agenda. Australian Defence Force personnel are seen during a training exercise at the Queensland Fire and Emergency services Academy in Brisbane . In addition, world leaders will hold one-on-one or bilateral meetings. 'I don't think security issues will come up in the main meeting but in side meetings they will come up.' 'It's a bit like speed dating, they'll line them up and Abbott will meet a whole lot of [other leaders] as the chair of the summit,' Mr Callaghan said. Mr Abbott has called for an apology from Russian President Vladimir Putin over the loss of 298 lives, including 38 Australians, when the MH17 plane was shot down over eastern Ukraine in July. But there are other non-economic issues he has made it clear he does not want to discuss, such as climate change. So far, the Australian G20 presidency has resisted making climate change a top agenda item, but it will likely be discussed after this week's historic carbon emissions reduction deal between the US and China. Earlier this week the two major polluters announced an ambitious agreement to slash their greenhouse gas output by 2030. British Prime Minister David Cameron has also indicated that he will press world leaders including Mr Abbott to do more to combat Ebola, which has so far killed more than 5000 people in West Africa.","The main game for the G20 summit is to boost global economic growth .

"Tony Matthews, 66, died after he was admitted to hospital and put in a store room because they ran out of beds . A hospital left a terminally-ill grandfather to die in a windowless store room a grieving widow has claimed. Tony Matthews, 66, spent the last hours of his life in a cramped room with 'glaring fluorescent light' as he suffered with mesothelioma, a rare form of cancer. The grandfather-of-three was admitted to Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital after falling ill at home but when he arrived he was told they did not have enough beds. Staff converted a store cupboard into a makeshift bedroom so he could be given privacy and pain relief in his final hours. He was accompanied by his wife Beryl, 66, and passed away three days after being admitted to hospital. Mrs Matthews said: 'I was told they hadn't got enough beds and so they had to convert store cupboards to make another bedroom. 'There was no window and a horrible fluorescent light which you couldn't dim and so it was only on bright or you sat in the darkness with just the light from the corridor. 'I just think he deserved better. He had this awful disease and he and I were very, very badly let down by the hospital.' She added that the lack of facilities meant she had returned home for a shower and was not at his side when he died. 'I feel as though I let him down as I'd promised I would be with him and I wasn't able to be there. 'They denied me the chance of being there at the end.' Mrs Matthews said she and her cousin were given permission to stay in the store room with him after he was admitted to hospital on November 4. To try and make him more comfortable they asked hospital staff for an extra pillow only to be told there were none available. They were also told they were not allowed a mattress and would have to sleep in their chairs if they wanted to stay in the room. Mrs Matthews stayed at the hospital for two nights but returned to her home in Attleborough in Norfolk, on November 6 for a shower. Beryl Matthews (right) pictured with her sister-in-law Anne Eden (left) had gone home for a shower after she claims there was a lack of facilities and missed her husband passing away by ten minutes . The side room on a ward where Tony Matthews, 66, died, which the hospital described as a refurbished treatment room and that he was put in it to give him privacy in his final hours . Later that evening she was contacted by the ward to tell her Mr Matthews' condition had deteriorated and she returned to the hospital to find he had died ten minutes earlier. Mesothelioma is a cancer of membrane cells which line major organs. It occurs most often in tissue around the lungs. Symptoms of the disease include acute chest pains, such as Mrs Allen suffered, a persistent cough and difficulty breathing, high temperatures and weight loss. More than 2,500 people are diagnosed with mesothelioma every year, with five times more men than women falling victim. According to the NHS, the disease is 'almost always' caused by asbestos, and takes 20 to 60 years to develop after the initial exposure. The cancer can be difficult to diagnose accurately, as affected cells do not look distinctive. Chemotherapy is the main treatment. Some surgical procedures are being investigated, but remain unproven. Because mesothelioma is so difficult to diagnose, it is often terminal by the time doctors notice. Patients rarely survive more than three years after diagnosis. The average is 12 months. Some 2,300 per year die of the disease, though experts expect this to increase as more workers exposed to asbestos in past decades are affected. By 2050, it is thought the cancer will have taken 90,000 lives. She added that the staff at the hospital had done what they could but questioned whether they were being given the right resources to do their job. 'They did a really good job of making sure he got pain relief towards the end,' she said. 'The staff were brilliant and they did whatever they could but they were limited.' Director of Nursing Emma McKay said: 'Mrs Matthews has raised concerns about the side room used on the ward. 'This room was chosen to provide greater privacy for the patient and family than would be afforded on the ward bays. 'We will be looking at the lighting in the room to see if changes can be made or a lamp can be installed to enable the lighting to be adjusted. 'A reclining chair was made available to allow Mrs Matthews to rest and while she spent time with her husband. 'We will take on board all the issues that have been raised and will be making changes where possible to improve the care we provide.' Mr Matthews' death comes a month after another patient at the hospital spent nine hours recovering from a serious infection in one of their store rooms. Ian Semmons, 65, claims he was disturbed through the night by apologetic nurses needing medical supplies. The hospital's chief executive since 2008, Anna Dugdale, admitted she would not allow her mother to be treated at the £229m hospital. Ms Dugdale said that drastic bed shortages at the 13-year-old hospital had forced them to use makeshift wards in a desperate bid to cope with a flood of admissions.

"When it comes to delinquent behaviour, it doesn't matter how emotionally mature a woman is when it comes to breaking the rules. A study has found that the majority of young women  will display some form of antisocial behaviour during puberty, regardless of whether they have high or low levels of emotional intelligence. While young men only carry out delinquent acts when they have a low level of emotional maturity. Plymouth University psychologists have studied emotional intelligence (EI) This is a level of how in-tune people are with their, and other's emotions. They found men with a low level of EI were more likely to be delinquent. But they found the opposite effect was true for women (stock image shown) In particular, the results revealed that men with a low level of emotional intelligence were more likely to turn to violence and aggression than men with a high level. But for young women, those with both high and low levels of emotional intelligence were just as likely to be antisocial or delinquent as each other. The study, by psychologists at Plymouth University, found that during puberty and into their early twenties, there was a correlation between a person wanting attention and antisocial behaviour. Emotional intelligence (EI) is the ability by a person to express and control their own emotions. It is also the ability to understand and respond to the emotions of others. Those with a high EI are able to emphasise more with other people and have a greater emotional maturity. Those with a lower EI are not always conscious about what others may be feeling and also find it more difficult to control their own emotions. Previous thinking suggested that those with a high level of emotional intelligence (EI) - or maturity - would have a greater ability to control their behaviour. But despite young men showing an ability to regulate their sensation seeking and delinquent behaviours, for females this made no difference. Those with a high level of EI actually showed a higher tendency for antisocial behaviour, researchers said. During the study around 100 young people were asked if, while between the ages of 12 and 25, they had engaged in forms of anti-social behaviour. The options ranged from truancy, rowdy behaviour in public, smoking cannabis and using public transport without a ticket, to other forms of delinquency such as drink driving, arson and physical violence. For young women, those with both high and low levels of emotional intelligence were just as likely to be antisocial or delinquent as each other (stock image of Mean Girls shown) They were also given detailed questionnaires to gauge their sensation seeking and track EI levels. The results showed young men with low EI and high levels of sensation seeking were more likely to carry out delinquency - but high EI tended to have a balanced effect and lower delinquency. Previous studies suggest men are more inclined to carry out violence and aggression - acts which do not necessarily require them to understand their victim's thoughts and emotions. For young women, however, those showing high levels of both factors were more inclined towards delinquency. Researchers believe they tended to veer more towards bullying, both of a social and emotional nature. During the study around 100 young people were asked if, while between the ages of 12 and 25, they had engaged in forms of anti-social behaviour. The options ranged from truancy and rowdy behaviour to more serious forms of delinquency such as drink driving, arson and physical violence (stock image shown) Dr Alison Bacon, a lecturer in psychology, who led the study, said: 'Levels of sensation seeking, where you actively seek out novel experiences, peak in adolescence, and there is a well-documented association of them with delinquency and other risk-taking behaviours. 'In general, high trait EI individuals are able to form positive and effective personal relationships and are able to regulate their emotions and behaviours in ways that support personal well-being. 'We predicted the relationship between sensation seeking and delinquent behaviour would be affected by EI, but to discover it seemingly only lessened delinquency in young men - and not young women - was a surprising and unprecedented result.' The study aimed to further investigate well-documented associations between sensation seeking and delinquency. But, in a first for research of its nature, they also factored in an individual's emotional intelligence, showing whether traits commonly seen as positive influences on well-being, such as empathy and self-regulation, impacted on a person's adolescent behaviour. 'By showing that high EI is a positive thing for young men, we can see that promoting it in schools and other social arenas could have positive outcomes,' Dr Bacon added. 'For young women, we need to further explore why traits which should lead to high levels of self-esteem and self-regulation might predispose them to antisocial relational behaviours. 'In turn, we hope to discover how we might help them find ways to channel their behaviour in a positive way.'","Plymouth University psychologists studied emotional intelligence (EI)
This is a level of how in-tune people are with their, and other's emotions .
Men with a low level of EI were more likely to be delinquent .
But they found the effect did not hold true for women .
Those that were more emotionally mature were just as likely to be antisocial as those with a low level .
Goes against previous theories that a high EI means people behave better ."
"Scam: Lisa Harrison, 34, promised customers low currency rates on US dollars and special deals . A wedding planner who stole £80,000 from couples in a bid to satisfy an 'out-of-control' online gambling addiction has been jailed. Lisa Harrison, 34, began taking money from her clients in summer 2013 by enticing them with low currency rates on US dollars and flight upgrades. She took money from 19 couples who had entrusted their savings to her after being promised the wedding of their dreams. It is understood that the company she worked for, iPlan New York, specialised in weddings in New York City. Her website iplannewyork.com, which has been taken down, said: 'iPlan New York was set up to create and style the perfect tailor made wedding for couples travelling to New York to get married! 'We are passionate about what we do and passionate about New York! We have experience in planning NYC weddings for couples from all over the world.' But she was arrested in December last year after eventually coming clean to her victims in an email and saying she had been forced to close her business. Police soon found she had taken £80,107 from the couples and spent a staggering £77,933 on gambling sites Paddy Power and William Hill. The business' Facebook page has also been deleted, but outraged victims have shared their victims on a wedding forum. One victim called Jennifer wrote in November 2013: 'I had previously given Lisa a positive review because our vow renewal went wonderful. 'Little did I know until last week that she didn't even pay the vendors that helped with our ceremony. 'I am so disgusted and can't fathom such an act. We paid her in full and to think that our photographer didn't even get paid is just astonishing to me. 'I feel so horrible for the other couples that had their perfect day planned and this woman decided to perform such an act. 'I pray for each of you in hopes that you will be able to move on from this and live a healthy and happy life with your significant other. 'I can't believe this woman took our money and did such an unthinkable act. God bless all of you and I hope this mess gets corrected quickly.' While another anonymous victim posted a copy of the email they claim they had been sent by Harrison when she admitted the scam. It read: 'I have to announce the closure of iPlan New York. 'For some time now I have been battling against a gambling addiction that has seen me lose all of the company money including money paid to me by you for services and dollars. 'I cannot go on another day with this situation as this illness has taken me over completely and I have to both face up to the consequences of my actions and seek help for the debilitating addiction. 'I am extremely ill with it and need to seek help as soon as possible. 'I am completely devastated that not only have I lost money of yours but betrayed your trust as a wedding planner. 'Right now I am uncertain as to what the future holds with regards to future weddings already planned, I will be in touch with the suppliers in NYC to inform them also. Sentence: Harrison, of Earith, Cambridgeshire, was jailed for two years at Peterborough Crown Court, above . 'I will today be having my computer and all electronic devices ceased (sic) under an intervention and handing myself into the police to give a statement and to tell them everything. 'No doubt you will be informing the police too and for those purposes it will be the Cambridgeshire Constabulary and my full name is Lisa Harrison and I will be handing myself in after sending these emails. 'I won’t be able to reply to any emails or calls for the time being as I will not have access. 'I am truly from the bottom of my heart so sorry for everything, as with addictions I thought I had everything under control and was in denial that I could put everything right, which I have been trying so desperately to do. 'As soon as and if I am able to communicate further about any outstanding issues I will do so. Lisa.' Posting on an online review site for the wedding service, one former customer said: 'We are due to go in less than 48 hours and we have nothing!! She has now closed down her website too! She has left us devastated!' Another, using the name Shaun, wrote: 'Alarm bells rang for me when she asked for all our spending money cos she had a deal on a currency card. While one woman, using the name Andrea, said: 'I am absolutely devastated for anyone who has used iPlan New York and subsequently been let down'. She added that she had a 'gut feeling' not to pay upfront. Harrison, of Earith, Cambridgeshire, admitted fraudulent trading and was jailed for two years at Peterborough Crown Court on Tuesday. Det Sgt Iain Moor, from Cambridgeshire Constabulary, said: 'This was an extremely distressing case for the 19 couples who lost life savings and had their dream day ruined by Harrison. 'I hope the victims received some comfort in the prison sentence imposed on Harrison, meaning they can now start to re-build their lives.'","Lisa Harrison enticed clients with low currency rates and flight upgrades .

"An illegal immigrant who has cost the taxpayer hundreds of thousands of pounds since arriving in the UK has won £600 in compensation for 'unlawful detention', it has been revealed. Sri Lankan-born Kamalan Ganesharajah has spent the last 22 years lying to immigration authorities about his identity in an attempt to remain in the UK, the High Court heard. Despite this, and his 35 criminal convictions, including one for handling stolen property, Ganesharajah has been awarded hundreds of pounds in compensation. Sri Lankan-born Kamalan Ganesharajah was detained on remand at HMP Wormwood Scrubs, pictured, in 2008 because of his persistent re-offending and was deemed a 'harm to the public good' Ganesharajah first entered the UK in October 1991 when he tried to claim asylum, which was refused in February 1993. He made repeated appeals to remain in the country and was granted a string of temporary 'extensions of leave' until  he was ordered out of Britain in May 2004. Ganesharajah lied repeatedly to immigration authorities about his criminal convictions, nationality, name and age frustrating the deportation system, the High Court heard. His case was flagged up to the authorities after it came to light that he had clocked up 35 convictions for 63 offences between August 1997 and June 2008. They included obtaining property by deception and handling stolen goods. In May 2008, Ganesharajah, whose age is not known, was detained on remand at HMP Wormwood Scrubs because of his persistent re-offending and was deemed a 'harm to the public good'. He spent the next four-and-a-half years at various immigration removal centres before finally being put on a flight to Sri Lanka on February 28 2013 - 22 years after first arriving in the UK. During his time in jail he repeatedly lied about where he was from, what his name was and how he came to the UK and mounted a 'deliberate campaign of misinformation and deception', the High Court heard. Despite this he was awarded £600 in compensation for being illegally detained after he made a claim against the Secretary of State for the Home Department. Last month the High Court of Justice ruled that although the majority of his time in jail or in an immigration removal centre was 'lawful', his first five days in jail were 'unlawful' as he had not been 'served a notice of detention' within the correct time period. Bobbie Cheema QC, sitting as Deputy High Court Judge, noted Ganesharajah's 'appalling criminal record', but stated: 'The first five days were unlawful in that no notice (of detention) had been served - substantial damages of £500 are awarded.' The ruling was revealed today. The court also ruled the following seven weeks in jail were 'unlawful' and awarded a further £100 of 'nominal damages'. According to court documents, Ganesharajah was sent to Dover Immigration Removal Centre (DIRC), and in August 2008 a detention review on his case stated: 'Mr Ganesharajah has shown a propensity to re-offend and as such can be considered a harm to the public good.' Various other 'detention reviews' stated that Ganesharajah should not be released as he was 'non-compliant' and had a 'high propensity to re-offend'. Prison chiefs stated that he should not be released until Emergency Travel Documents (ETD) were issued by the Sri Lankan High Commission so he could be deported. Ganesharajah lied repeatedly to immigration authorities about his criminal convictions, nationality, name and age frustrating the deportation system, the High Court, pictured, heard. Ganesharajah, however, told officials he 'did not want to go back to Sri Lanka' and refused to cooperate with the ETD process and in January 2010 threatened a member of staff at DIRC and got into a fight with another illegal immigrant. During his time on detention Ganesharajah put in an appeal to the European Court of Human Rights, saying he was being unlawfully detained. Jonathan Nancekivell-Smith, a Director at the Home Office, wrote in 2010 that Ganesharajah had 'multiple identities' and if released was at risk of 'absconding' and committing more crimes. Ganesharajah was told that his appeal to the European Court of Human Rights was not a 'high priority' for the court and was told there was a 'backlog of 30 years' for cases. In July 2010, a case worker stated: 'He informed me he would rather stay in detention or prison that go home.' He told the case worker Sri Lanka was a 'foreign country to him' and that he would rather go to India, where he claimed to have an uncle. He also claimed his real name was Amit Sohail and that he was an Indian Muslim and that he could only speak Hindi, not Tamil, a language of Sri Lanka - but refused to be fingerprinted so Indian authorities could check. He also claimed to be from the Maldives, saying he had relatives there. He was due to be flown out of the UK on August 28 2011, but didn't get on the flight because of red tape over his identity - with the same thing happening again on September 28 2011. In another meeting with immigration officials in November 2012, Ganesharajah said he was 'unsure of his nationality' and claimed that he was a child when he arrived in the UK in 1991. A report stated that Ganesharajah had 'frustrated' the deportation process by 'switching his nationality from one to another'. He was finally put on a flight to Sri Lanka on February 28 2013 - 22 years after arriving in the UK - after telling the authorities 'he was prepared to move to any country in order to be released from detention'. A source, who works in immigration and speaking on condition on anonymity, said today: 'Day in, day out we deal with cases like this where we have to jump through hoops and bow down to legal loopholes which prevent us from deporting people. 'It's got to the stage where we are banging our heads against a brick wall and in the end this guy gets a £600 payout from the British taxpayer. It would be funny if it wasn't so ridiculous.' He added: 'The time he has spent in prison and detention centres will have cost upwards of £250,000. 'I dare not think how much the court cases, legal challenges, cancelled chartered flights and all the paperwork have cost in the past 20-odd years, but it's safe to say it will be substantially more than £1m.'","Sri Lankan-born Kamalan Ganesharajah first arrived in the UK in 1991 .

Cox, from Killarney, Ireland, said: 'The video shows the beauty of the Arctic environment from the standpoint of a group of photographers. 'There were some difficulties with the drone used to capture the aerial footage - it didn't like being that far north and ended up nearly crashing a couple of times because of compass problems.'

The conditions in the Arctic can change in a second, so any adventure is always a dangerous one . The video has received rave reviews online, and Cox added: 'I think people really enjoy seeing such a remote and beautiful environment from a different perspective.' His video captures the journey of a ship navigating its way through giant icebergs, polar bears relaxing on the snow and walruses frolicking in the sea. Still images taken throughout the journey not only capture the awe-inspiring beauty of the icy landscape, but also Arctic animals in their habitat. Writing on his website, Cox says: It was a place that Kevin (Raber, a colleague on the trip) and I were very keen to return to after our trip there in 2013. 'The Arctic gets under my skin in a way that few other locations have. Dramatic landscapes, beautiful and plentiful wildlife and, of course, ice.'

He was also named ‘Landscape Photographer of the Year’ in both the single image and portfolio categories at the National Photographic Awards in 2007. The name Svalbard means 'cold coasts' and was first mentioned in Icelandic texts in the 12th century. Nearly 65 per cent of the surface of Svalbard consists of protected areas, including three nature reserves, six national parks, 15 bird sanctuaries and one geotopical protected area. Norway's largest glacier, Austfonna, is located on Svalbard. Austfonna is the world's third-largest icecap after Antarctic and Greenland, with a glacier front of 186 miles.","Irishman Peter Cox snapped incredible photos and video on Norway's Svalbard archipelago .

"A Melbourne man took his frustration out on his girlfriend's one-year-old baby because he suspected she was having sex with their drug dealer while she was scoring them heroin.

On the day of the murder - May 15 last year - she left their Richmond flat several times to do errands and buy heroin. 'This was frustrating you because she often took quite a long time to score,' Justice Emerton said, recounting witness testimony. 'Your suspicions were aroused because you thought she was either ""f***ing the dealer or f***ing around with the dealer"".' The attacks on Silas occurred during his mother's absence and Ta-Vuong wrapped the baby for bed while he was dying or already dead. The couple used the drugs on the mother's return and did not check on Silas for several hours. 'She found him still wrapped up on his back in the centre of the cot. Silas could not be roused and was stone cold. In fact, he was dead,' Justice Emerton said. On the day of the murder - May 15 last year - Silas' mum left their Richmond flat several times to do errands and buy heroin . Ta-Vuong told police the injuries were caused by rough play and later changed his story to a bathroom slip while holding the baby. The jury rejected that such injuries - skull fractures, a lacerated liver and broken ribs - could be accidental. Justice Emerton said Ta-Vuong did not divert from his claim it was accidental and so displayed a lack of remorse. 'I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt Silas suffered multiple violent impacts at your hands, including at least one very severe impact to his head.' Ta-Vuong sat silently in the dock and showed little reaction as his sentence was read out. He must serve a non-parole period of 20 years.","Paul Ta-Vuong, 31, was jailed for 25 years for death of his girlfriend's baby .

"Stuff of nightmares: The piranha has preyed on our imaginations for decades . The seven-year-old girl was just one of thousands in the water of the mighty River Parana on the afternoon of Christmas Day last week. For residents of the central Argentine city of Rosario, the festive season most certainly does not involve eating mince pies and drinking eggnog before sleeping it off in front of a fire. Instead, with the mercury hitting a sticky 100 degrees, most are keener to cool off than to gorge themselves. The best place for a dip is the city’s Rambla Catalunya, a mile-long stretch of sandy beach on South America’s second largest river. With bars, restaurants and fun fairs, the beach is a major attraction and last Wednesday was no exception. Tens of thousands had gathered to enjoy the holiday. Many took the opportunity to swim or paddle in the river. That afternoon, as the little girl splashed up to her waist in the waters, everything seemed quite normal. Then, she suddenly felt a tugging at the little finger of her left hand. Instinctively, she pulled away, but the tugging grew more powerful. And then came a searing pain that caused her to cry out. She looked down at her finger, but all she could see was a trail of blood leaking into the dark water.As she ran for the shore, her screams startled the sunbathers. The top part of the girl’s finger had been completely torn away. There could be no doubt what had happened. The girl had been attacked by one of man’s most feared creatures — the deadly piranha fish. Word quickly spread up and down the Rambla Catalunya. Lifeguards ordered people to stay out of the water but, tragically, the heat was so intense and the atmosphere so jubilant that people continued to swim. What happened next was like a scene from a horror film. That afternoon, some 70 people - around 20 of them children - were savaged by shoals of the razor-toothed fish. Those who were attacked had chunks of their naked and exposed flesh ripped away. Scroll down for video . Attacked: A man is treated after being bitten by the dangerous fish on Christmas Day in Argentina . They emerged from the waters with agonising wounds dripping blood onto the white sand. Deep cuts were reported on scores of fingers, ankles and toes. One injury resulted in an amputation. Pictures taken in the local hospital show one man with the whole underside of one toe missing. The attack was the most serious in the city since 2008, when 40 swimmers were hurt and, while mercifully no one was killed, the story made headlines around the world. There is something about this sinister fish that preys on our imaginations. Along with great white sharks, wolves, pythons and crocodiles, the piranha is the stuff of nightmares. Ever since Boy’s Own adventure stories described game hunters and explorers being devoured after daring to swim in piranha-infested waters, we have been taught that the piranha is one of the deadliest predators on the planet. Most of us can create a horrific mental image of falling into a river - and being stripped to the bone in two minutes by a boiling shoal of flesh-eating fish. Just such a fate was memorably portrayed in the James Bond film You Only Live Twice, when the evil Blofeld dispatched Helga Brandt into a tank of piranhas for her failure to kill Bond. Although not as great a horror movie staple as the great white shark - immortalised in the Jaws films - our fascination with the piranha has made for box office success. Since 1978, there have been at least six films starring the piranha. The most recent was last year’s Piranha 3D. No wonder Londoners were alarmed when a piranha was discovered in the Thames in 2004. Experts stressed that the fish had in all likelihood been thrown away by a collector of rare fish, and further reassured anxious Londoners that the water of the Thames is far too cold to sustain these creatures. Vicious: Attacks by piranha fish are becoming more frequent . Yet despite their awesome power, scientists insist piranhas are not the malicious predators the films would have you believe. They tend to attack humans only if trapped or hungry. So who is to blame for our fear of this fish? It is none other than Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th president of the U.S. In 1914, he published a travel book Through The Brazilian Wilderness, in which he described how piranhas could eat entire animals, such as cattle, alive. ‘They are the most ferocious fish in the world,’ Roosevelt wrote. ‘The head with its short muzzle, staring malignant eyes, and gaping, cruelly armed jaws, is the embodiment of evil ferocity; and the actions of the fish exactly match its looks.’ Roosevelt’s book was read by many, and the piranha entered into the public consciousness as one of mankind’s most vicious foes. However, what Roosevelt was not told was that the piranha attack he had witnessed on a cow was staged. For the benefit of the former president, the Brazilians had trapped hundreds of piranhas in a netted-off stretch of the river and had then starved them for days. This created the ideal conditions. When Roosevelt arrived, a sick old cow was led into the water, with its udder slit to release blood to further encourage an attack. Trapped, starving, and excited by blood, the piranhas did their job all too well. Rumours of deadly South American fish had been known since the time of the Spanish Conquistadors, who reported they were often attacked when they forded rivers. In the 19th century, naturalist and explorer Alexander von Humboldt insisted the piranha was one of the continent’s greatest dangers. What sets them apart from other fish are their terrifying sharp teeth, tightly packed into highly muscular jaws. Relative to its size - they grow up to ten inches long - a piranha has a more powerful bite than that of a Tyrannosaurus Rex. Recently, scientists measured the bite force of the black piranha at 320 newtons, which is nearly three times greater than that exerted by an American alligator. That is more than enough to rip off a finger. What is disturbing is that these attacks are becoming more frequent. In November 2011, 15 swimmers were bitten by piranhas in the River Paraguay in western Brazil. Powerful: When scientists measured the power of a piranha's bite last year it was easily enough to sever a finger . One, 22-year-old Elson de Campos Pinto, recalled how he suddenly felt an agonising pain in his foot. ‘I saw that I had lost the tip of my toe,’ he said. ‘I took off running out of the river, afraid that I would be further attacked because of the blood. I’m not going back in for a long time.’ One local fisherman talked of catching some of the fish in his nets and often seeing blood on the banks. Despite relying on the river for his livelihood, Hildegard Galeno Alves said: ‘I would never even think of going in there.’ In Bolivia the following month, a drunk 18-year-old fisherman jumped out of his canoe, and was seized by a shoal of piranhas. Although he managed to get out of the water, he bled to death. Last year, a five-year-old Brazilian girl is said to have been attacked and killed in the water by a shoal of the fish. After the feeding frenzy in Argentina last week, Carlos Vacarezza, a local expert, said that the Christmas Day attack was ‘exceptional and unlikely to be repeated’. ‘What happened has no logical explanation,’ he told a local radio station. ‘In this area, the water flows too fast to create the warm and stagnant conditions where the fish are comfortable.’ While some observers claimed the piranha were attracted by debris left by fishermen, the only explanation Mr Vacarezza could suggest was that one of the fish had been injured - and the shoal had descended to eat it. Some of the human bathers simply got in the way. Certainly, cannibalism among piranhas is common, and larger, more aggressive fish will take a bite out of smaller rivals. The Christmas Day attack alone would have been enough to terrify most of us. But there have been more since. On Boxing Day, in the town of Posadas, 600 miles up the River Parana (the name, although it sounds like that of the fish, actually translates as ‘big as the sea’)  to the north-east, five children and teenagers were attacked by piranhas. All had to be treated in hospital. And then, on Friday, back at the Rambla Catalunya in Rosario, another attack took place. At four o’clock in the afternoon, a ten-year-old boy was bitten on his right hand, and he too had to be taken to hospital. The experts may like to reassure us that piranha attacks on humans are rare, but are they right? Perhaps the truth about the dreaded  piranha may be closer to the horror movies after all.","Bathers were attacked on the Rambla Catalunya beach in Argentina .

"Night shift employees often need to find creative ways of filling their time. But workers at a French supermarket have certainly found one of the most creative ways of filling their time while they were meant to be filling shelves. Arranging pallets and products into a behemoth domino chain, viewers are taken on a tour through the store by way of the domino effect. Filmed by Eric Bourde, the chain begins outside the Rennes store of Belgian supermarket chain Cora. A worker pushes the first wooden pallet, at the automatic door entrance of a Burgundy shopping centre - kicking off the impressive domino chain that diverges and meets again after going around a tree. Stack 'em up: The domino chain started with wooden pallets that led to the Normandy supermarket's entrance . Up and away: The products ranged in size and shape . As the domino chain reaches the supermarket aisles, the dominos become the products that customers would find in each aisle if they were shopping there. From DVDs and CDs to tetra-paks of juice and tissue boxes, nothing is off limits in the massive domino effect of supermarket products. Aisle be watching! The impressive domino chain went from aisle to aisle . Everything but the kitchen sink: As the domino chain made it's way through the aisles, the different products available to shoppers were showcased . Eventually, the chain ends at the checkout and a young female employee is seen holding a sign, that translates in English to ‘Thank you for your visit’. Some viewers of the video have branded it a marketing stunt, but either way - it will no doubt serve as inspiration for bored supermarket workers everywhere.","Filmed in 2013 at Burgundy branch of supermarket chain Cora .

"If you think exam pressure is bad in the West, take a moment to sympathise with the students of South Korea. Today, around 650,000 students are sitting the annual university entrance exam, which are critical to youngsters in the country, impacting not only their future careers, but also marriage. Success in the exam means a secured place in one of South Korea's elite universities and so crucial are good results that the entire nation goes into 'hush' mode on exam day - by grounding planes, clearing roads and even halting military exercises. Stress: Around 650,000 students are sitting the exam simultaneously in 1,257 centres across the country . On test day, the transportation ministry bans all airport landings and departures for a 40-minute period to coincide with the main language listening test - held simultaneously in 1,257 centres nationwide. Public offices and major businesses, as well as the stock market, opened an hour later than usual to help keep the roads relatively clear and ensure students arrived on time for the exam. The military has rescheduled airforce drills and live-firing exercises, while traffic is barred within a 200 metre radius of test centres. And if you did happen to have a crisis in the morning, students could dial the emergency number 112 and request help from police cars and motorbikes on standby to rush them to exam centres. At Seoul's Pungmoon Girls' High School, junior students huddled together holding banners wishing good luck and shouted encouragement as the seniors entered the exam room. For the equally stressed parents, there was little left to do after a final hug at the school gates than pray. Many immediately made their way to nearby churches and temples in search of some divine intervention. One student with no parental backing was 81-year-old Cho Hee-Ok who sat the test in the hope of gaining a place in a fashion college. Pray: Parents light candles for their children' success at the Jogye Temple in Seoul, South Korea . Forced to give up her early schooling and take up needlework to help her widowed mother, Cho told Yonhap her dream was to work 'making clothes for poor neighbours'. Major Internet portals and social networks were flooded with messages of support, and 'test-takers' and 'jackpot for the test' were among the top-trending topics for Korean Twitter users this morning. Some warned against taking the exam too seriously. 'Don't do anything stupid,' wrote one user on the top portal Naver. 'Don't kill yourself just because you mess up the test. There are many people who succeed in life without going to college.' The approach of exam day tends to renew a perennial debate in South Korea about the country's obsession with education and the pros and cons of the college entrance system. The bottom line for many is that the examination itself is fair. Everyone takes the same paper, which relies on the multiple choice system to prevent subjective marking. But bitter disputes still occur. A question in the Geography section of the 2013 exam -- worth three points out of a total 340 -- became the subject of a costly, year-long legal battle after the officially correct answer was challenged by some students and their parents. Security is absolute, with the hundreds of exam setters sequestered for more than a month in a secret location, which they are only allowed to leave once the test has been taken. Pressure: Students sit the College Scolastic Aptitude Test at Poongmun high school in Seoul today . Unhappy: A recent study said South Korean children were the least happy among developed countries . They are kept in total isolation, denied phone contact with their families and with everything down to their food waste subject to rigorous examination. South Korean parents spent 19 trillion won ($17.5 billion) on extra tuition for their children last year, AFP reported. The pressure is so severe, that on the night before the exam, a 17-year old boy was found dead  having apparently jumped from the window of his family's apartment. His parents told Yonhap news agency that he had become extremely stressed as the test neared. Preparation for the exam starts from primary school - as does the relentless pressure that has been blamed for everything from early burnout to teenage depression and suicide. Last week, a government study revealed South Korean children are the least . happy among developed countries, citing the stress of the nations' educational pressure cooker. South Korea ranked at the bottom among 30 countries in terms . of children's satisfaction with their lives, the country's . health ministry said, followed by Romania and Poland.","Around 650,000 students are sitting the annual university entrance exam .

"A charismatic and inspirational moon bear who became a symbol of the animal welfare movement in China after surviving 30 years of captivity on a bile farm has died after beating overwhelming odds to live out the final years of his life in freedom. Oliver the bear won a host of celebrity admirers including Born Free star Virginia McKenna and Downton Abbey actress Lesley Nicol after being rescued with a group of other bears from appallingly cramped cages in a bear farm in Shandong. He confounded expectations when he survived emergency roadside surgery during his dramatic rescue in 2010 to live his remaining four years in a bear sanctuary in Chengdu, western China, run by the British charity Animals Asia. Scroll down for video . Emotional: Downton Abbey star Lesley Nicol was moved to tears by the sight of him shuffling around his enclosure when she visited the Animals Asia sanctuary in Chengdu in Chengdu sanctuary in June . Tearful: Stream of employees who rescued and then cared for Oliver said their goodbyes by holding his paws on Wednesday when he was euthanised because of his worsening condition . Charming bruiser: Oliver beat the odds to survive his terrible ordeal and then enjoy his freedom at a sanctuary run by British charity Animals Asia . A charming bruiser who seemed to shrug off the shocking infirmities wrought by years of abuse, Oliver came to epitomise the growing animal rights movement in Asia and starred in a film called Cages of Shame that helped turn public opinion against bear bile farming. Moon bears rarely live beyond 30, however, and Downton Abbey star Lesley Nicol was moved to tears by the sight of him shuffling around his enclosure when she visited the Animals Asia sanctuary in Chengdu in Chengdu sanctuary in June. But on Wednesday, as his condition worsened, vets took the decision to euthanise him and a stream of employees who helped rescue him and then cared for him at the sanctuary in his peaceful last years held his paw to say a tearful final goodbye. Animals Asia founder and CEO Jill Robinson MBE said she was heartbroken at Oliver's death but said he had won the most important battle of his life when he survived his rescue from the Shandong bear farm in 2010. 'Oliver was a broken bear when we found him,' she recalled. 'His body and legs were misshapen by years of being crushed in a cage and we feared he would not survive the 1,500 mile journey home. 'On that day, when Oliver's condition began to deteriorate – panting heavily and refusing to eat – our vets decided that only an emergency operation would save his life. Fight for life: Oliver had to undergo four hours of surgery by the roadside when he was rescued. Oliver's diseased gall bladder was removed along with a painful metal coil that had been inserted into his abdomen . Suffering: More than 10,000 endangered Asiatic black bears – known as moon bears - are confined in tiny cages from birth in farms across China and southeast Asian countries. Oliver pictured above in his cage . Harvested: Catheters are jabbed into the bears' abdomens to extract bile from their gall bladders. Bear bile sells for around £10-a-millilitre and is used in traditional Chinese medicines to treat a range of illnesses . 'He was an old bear who had suffered more than anyone can imagine but it just didn't seem right that he could be so close to freedom and not make it.' With a local police escort, the trucks carrying Oliver and the other bears rescued from the farm went to a local hospital and borrowed a bottle of oxygen needed for anaesthetic. After four hours of roadside surgery watched by a huge crowd of onlookers, Oliver's diseased gall bladder was removed along with a crude and painful metal coil that had been inserted into his abdomen to fasten the gall bladder to his abdominal wall. Robinson said: 'Oliver brought so many people together that day – from Shandong to Chengdu and across the country – and he's continued to do so ever since. As an old bear who refused to give up, his fight inspired ours. 'His story has continued to be told across the world and has raised increasing awareness of the horrors of bear bile farming. Our broken bear turned teacher and his stoic, gentle nature will continue to inspire the rescue of so many more.' More than 10,000 endangered Asiatic black bears – known as moon bears for the cream-coloured crescents on their chests – are confined in tiny cages from birth in farms across China and southeast Asian countries. Crude catheters are jabbed into the bears' abdomens to extract bile from their gall bladders. Bear bile sells for around £10-a-millilitre and is used in traditional Chinese medicines to treat a range of illnesses from haemorrhoids and sore throats to hangovers. Campaign: Animals Asia founder Jill Robinson MBE with Lesley during the visit. Other celebrity backers include Olivia Newton-John, Ricky Gervais and Dame Judi Dench . Many bears rescued from the farms are left blind or have had their teeth and claws hacked out by farmers. Many are psychologically scarred by their captivity. In a campaign backed by celebrities including Olivia Newton-John, Ricky Gervais and Dame Judi Dench, Animals Asia is working with the Chinese government to phase out bear bile farming and persuade people to use herbal alternatives. Animals Asia Vet Team Director Nic Field said: 'The entire team is devastated at Oliver's passing. Despite everything he went through, his forgiving and spirited nature touched everyone who met him. 'Oliver's story is so powerful and he has become a focal point of the growing support of our work in China. He represents the suffering of the thousands of bears still languishing on China's bear farms. 'More importantly he has been a symbol of hope. Every visitor to the sanctuary and every supporter around the world knows Oliver's story. His legacy will live on.'","Oliver survived 30 years in captivity on a bile farm in China and beat the odds to live four more years of freedom after being rescued .

"Residents left angry because their only pub is being turned into a mini supermarket staged a 'booze in' and downed pints - in the village Co-op. Villagers say they are fuming after learning the former Ship Inn is to become into a convenience store. The pub is being transformed into a Co-Op - the second Co-op in the hamlet of Whitemans Green, Cuckfield, West Sussex. Scroll down for video. Angry villagers: Residents of Whitemans Green, Cuckfield, West Sussex staged a 'booze in' in their local supermarket to protest plans to turn the 200-year-old Ship Inn pub into a Co-op . Dozens of residents showed their disapproval by buying pints from another pub nearby and taking them into existing Co-Op where they milled around drinking. They say their village will be damaged if the only boozer gets turned into their second mini-supermarket. The anti-Co-op collective is run by Jamie Oliver's favourite barbecue cook DJ BBQ Christian Stevenson, 46. He masterminded the idea to gather 40 fellow boozers to peacefully sup a pint in the village Co-op as a defiant act of 'revenge.' The anti-Co-op collective is run by Jamie Oliver's favourite barbecue cook Christian Stevenson (pictured) Mr Stevenson and his fellow residents gathered at the Co-op to protest plans to convert the 200-year-old pub into a shop. Mr Stevenson said: 'The Co-op has unethically taken over our pub so we are taking over the Co-op. 'We want to shame the Co-op. They are stealing our local pub. 'The pub has been there for 200 years, and now it's being turned into something that will irreparably damage our village life. If the scheme goes ahead, there will be two Co-op shops within three-quarters of a mile. Mr Stevenson, who goes under the name DJ BBQ, is one of celeb chef Jamie's contributors to his Food Tube series of culinary videos. The 200-year-old Ship Inn is the only pub in the village. If the scheme goes ahead, there will be two Co-op shops within three-quarters of a mile . 'The pub is the heart and soul of the village, and we don't have another drinking hole. More importantly, it's also going to threaten our local shop, Wealden Stores. 'They source everything from local pieman, butchers, you can't get more local than them, and it's got a post office. We want to keep local businesses thriving.' The village's campaign to save The Ship Inn has even received the backing of their local MP, Sir Nicholas Soames. The Tory MP for Mid Sussex has written to Co-op opposing their proposals, and even raised the issue in the House of Commons on Monday, in an address to pubs minister Kris Hopkins. Sir Nicholas said: 'Is my Honourable friend aware of the serial bad behaviour by the Co-op in my constituency and others in the south, where it is taking over pubs and converting them into shops, often on very unsatisfactory sites? 'The Ship Inn in Cuckfield in my constituency is uniquely badly placed to serve as a Co-op. The village's campaign to save The Ship Inn has received the backing of their local MP, Sir Nicholas Soames . 'Will he look at what he can do to review the article 4 direction scheme, and to give general instructions about where such shops should be sited?' Petitioners and Sir Nicholas are also appealing to Mid Sussex District Council to issue an immediate Article 4 order on the pub - which could force the owners to apply for planning permission to change the pub into a supermarket. Kris Hopkins MP said: 'The article 4 direction scheme is strong, and it gives councils the opportunity to intervene. 'I know that there is a passionate campaign to support The Ship Inn. 'I would welcome the opportunity to meet the campaigners, and I will try to support them where I can.' However, planning bosses at the council have decided to let the Ship sink, because they fell it is unfair to force the Co-op to apply for planning permission. Thumbs down: More than 1,200 people signed the petition calling for Co-op to back down . Councillor Norman Webster said: 'We understand the frustration of local people at the Coop's ability to convert the Ship Inn without the need for a planning application but an Article 4 Direction is not the answer in this case.' More than 1,200 people have signed the petition calling for Co-op to back down from their proposals, but the supermarket chain are standing firm. A spokesperson for The Co-operative Food said: 'Given that the developer has decided to convert the Ship to a convenience store, we - as a long established retailer in Cuckfield - have submitted proposals to open a new food store in a bid to greatly improve the shopping experience for the people of the village. 'If we were to open the proposed new store it would include a bakery, an excellent fresh food department including meat, fruit and vegetables, and a community information area.'","Jamie Oliver's favourite BBQ chef Chrisian Stevenson leading the group .

"A young farmer who fired a shotgun to protect his mother from being run over by intruders is suing a controversial crime tsar who claimed he endangered the public. Bill Edwards, 23, has accused North Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner Julia Mulligan and North Yorkshire Police of smearing him – then squandering tens of thousands of pounds of taxpayers’ money to fight the £50,000 libel case at court. He claims remarks Mrs Mulligan made in a radio interview – based on police advice – were libellous and have led to him being shunned by potential employers. Bill Edwards, 23,  (pictured) has accused North Yorkshire PCC Julia Mulligan and police of smearing him . Former public schoolboy Mr Edwards was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder in August 2012 after catching two burglars red-handed as they tried to steal tools, furniture and scrap metal from his family's property. As his mother, Louisa Smith, frantically dialled the police for help, one thief fled on foot while the other jumped into a Ford Transit van and accelerated towards her. Fearing for their lives, Mr Edwards fired his legally-held shotgun at the vehicle as Mrs Smith screamed: Shoot out the tyres.’ Mr Edwards hit the windscreen and bodywork — but nobody was hurt. They then gave chase, with the farmer driving while his mother gave a running commentary to police on her mobile phone. Police eventually caught culprit David Taylor a few miles away. North Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner Julia Mulligan (pictured) is being sued by Mr Edwards over remarks she made during a radio interview in January 2013 . Despite the terrifying ordeal at the isolated woodland property near Scarborough, North Yorkshire, Mr Edwards was arrested, locked up overnight and had his guns confiscated. In December 2012 – after languishing on bail for four months– police dropped the charges after prosecutors concluded he used ‘reasonable force in self-defence’. Meanwhile, Taylor, who claimed he had been ‘traumatised’ during the break-in, was charged with theft and escaped with a paltry £100 fine – prompting Mr Edwards to tell his story to the Daily Mail. Mr Edwards (pictured left) fired a shotgun to protect his mother, Louisa Smith (right) from being run over by intruders . But in January 2013, Mrs Mulligan gave an interview to BBC Radio York claiming there were ‘exceptional circumstances’ which had led to his arrest. Despite being completely exonerated, the Tory crime tsar – under fire for spending £10,000 on ‘branding’ including a new logo at a time of crippling police cuts – suggested Mr Edwards had not told the truth, according to court papers. She told listeners there were ‘aspects of this case that are quite serious and I think that those details are not in the public domain… We cannot let people get the impression that they can take the law into their own hands.’ Mr Edwards (pictured) is also challenging the police over a decision to confiscate his legally-held shotgun and other firearms which he used to control pests on farmland and revoke his license . Court documents claim the PCC was wrongly briefed by senior North Yorkshire Police officers that Mr Edwards tried to shoot out the thief’s tyres during the high-speed chase – rather than while he was standing in the farm’s yard. In its defence to the lawsuit, North Yorkshire Police admitted Acting Assistant Chief Constable Ken McIntosh had ‘apologised’ for passing ‘inaccurate information’ to the crime tsar. It ‘extended’ the apology to Mr Edwards, but insisted this was ‘without any admission of liability for defamation’. Mr Edwards said Mrs Mulligan’s remarks were defamatory and that it is hard for him to find work because farmers in the community now think he is a liar. The ordeal took place at an isolated woodland property near Scarborough, North Yorkshire . He is also challenging the police over a decision to confiscate his shotgun and other firearms which he used to control pests on farmland and revoke his license. He said: ‘After the thief was fined they had me on the news and radio and then they had the police on. That should have been the conclusion of everything. ‘But [Julia Mulligan] went and made these statements that destroyed everything. My boss came out and told me to leave work because he heard that on the radio and sent me home. ‘I went from being a hero who saved my mum’s life while standing up to a thief, to people thinking there was something I was hiding. Their assumption was, “What is he not telling us? What is he hiding?” ‘It is a huge burden because people who I used to work with think I’m a liar who has not been telling the truth. Court documents claim the PCC (pictured) was wrongly briefed by senior North Yorkshire Police officers that Mr Edwards tried to shoot out the thief’s tyres during the high-speed chase . ‘Farmers have tens of thousands pounds of equipment and machinery and why would they trust me on their machinery? You're finished if something happens and they don't trust you. ‘I was hoping for an on-air apology to rectify what she had said because it has had a huge effect on me, but she has refused.’ A court hearing is pencilled in for Leeds High Court in January, where the commissioner – elected to hold the force into account – will be represented by the same legal team as the police, prompting concerns about a conflict of interest. Solicitor Andrew Gray, who represents Mr Edwards, said: ‘My client's life has become a living hell, due to the actions and failures of North Yorkshire Police and its Police and Crime Commissioner. Bill is a hero, not a villain, and he should be have been treated accordingly.’ The case is understood to have cost North Yorkshire Police around £40,000 of taxpayers’ money. The force claim it would be ‘inappropriate’ to comment on the case. Mrs Mulligan said: ‘Mr Edwards has instigated legal proceedings and it isn’t appropriate that either of us should comment on the details of a live legal case. We need to let this case follow due process and I have every confidence that it will come to an appropriate outcome.’","Bill Edwards, 23, has accused North Yorkshire's PCC of smearing him .

"He is accused of raping and strangling teenage beauty queen Bronwynne Richardson - his own cousin -  and dumping her battered body in  the Murray River 40 years ago. Colin Newey was only 20-years-old when, according to police, he abducted 17-year-old Richardson from outside Coles in the NSW border town of Albury, strangled her and took her body along a picturesque walking trail and left it in a lagoon. But the broken down 61-year-old, who a judge says is a convicted thief and arsonist as well as alcohol and drug abuser, is due to be released from a NSW jail and will be allowed to return to his home in South Australia. Scroll down for video . Abducted, raped and murdered: Four decades after teen beauty queen Bronwynne Richardson (pictured) was abducted, raped and murdered in the NSW border town of Albury, police arrested  cousin, Colin Newey, and charged him with killing the 17-year-old  in 1973 and dumping her batterd body in a lagoon . Sexual attraction: Colin Newey, 61 (pictured after his arrested in July this year) was the 20-year-old cousin of Bronwynne Richardson when, police allege, he raped and murdered her partly because of his sexual attraction to the teenage beauty queen. But a judge has let him out of bail, saying there is little useful evidence to convict . Bronwynne Richardson (pictured, left and right)) had just finished work at Coles in Albury on the evening of October 12, 1973 and was waiting for a lift home when a car pulled up and she was dragged into the vehicle, then raped, strangled and murdered. Her body was dumped in the Murray River and found two days later at Horseshoe Lagoon, 6km west of where she had been taken . Justice Richard Button has granted Colin Michael Newey bail because 'there is no scientific evidence such as DNA to implicate' Newey in the four decade old crime, the Nine Network reports. Police hailed it as breakthrough in the case in July, when detectives from the NSW Unsolved Homicide Team travelled to South Australia and arrested Newey and charged him with Ms Richardson's 1973 abduction, rape and murder. Despite numerous police statements by eye witnesses, two inquests, charges laid against three men but no convictions, Ms Richardson's family have endured decades in limbo since the 17-year-old's violent slaying. Police say Colin Newey was sexually attracted to Ms Richardson (pictured after the 17-year-old won her beauty crown at the Corowa Show in 1973) who he allegedly raped and strangled and then dumped her body in a lagoon on the Murray River . It was just after 7pm on Friday, October 12, 1973 when Bronwynne Richardson was on a footpath in Smollett Street, in central Albury, waiting for a lift home following her shift working at Coles. Earlier in the year the 17-year-old had won a beauty contest at the Corowa Show, being crowned Miss Corowa Show Beauty Queen in the town which lies 50km west along the Murray River from her home in Albury. A car pulled up on Smollett Street and Ms Richardson was dragged into the vehicle. She was driven to a reserve off a road about 6km west of Albury, where she was raped and beaten. She was then strangled and her body was dumped in the Murray River.  Two days later, on Sunday, October 14, her body was  from Horseshoe Lagoon, on a walking trail in West Albury. Police investigated the murder but were unable to determine who was responsible. In 1975, a coronial inquest found that Ms Richardson died of strangulation and drowning. In 1990, based upon new information, a fresh investigation was launched and three men were charged in connection with the crime, however none of them were convicted. In 2008, the newly-formed Southern Region Unsolved Homicide Team commenced an investigation into the case under Strike Force Kulaman and a number of new lines of inquiry were established. Another coronial inquest in 2011 resulted in more fresh information being presented, providing police with their strongest line of inquiry to date. Police arrested Colin Newey in July in Murray Bridge, 75km south-east of Adelaide, and extradited him back to Sydney and placed him in prison to await a murder trial. Newey applied to the NSW Supreme Court for bail on Thursday in a hearing in which the Crown alleged he was in part motivated to murder by his sexual interest in Ms Richardson, and had been making 'salacious comments' about his cousin prior to the killing. But Justice Richard Button said in the Supreme Court that the accusations against Newey were founded on the evidence of a 56-year-old witness who had been 17 at the time of the alleged comments. He described Newey as a 'petty criminal' and with long-standing problems over alcohol and cannabis abuse, and convictions for stealing, arson and driving offences going back decades. In 1974, Newey had been convicted and fined the 'surprisingly small' amount of $40 for possessing a silencer. But he had never been convicted of a serious offence, the court heard. And Justice Button contended that 'there is a real dispute that the Crown can prove the accused was the person or one of the persons who committed those actions'. He granted Newey bail and ordered he may return home to Murray Bridge under strict conditions.","Colin Newey is accused of murdering his cousin Bronwynne Richardson 40 years ago .

Kerr, 31, was charged with two counts of endangering the life, health or safety of a person after an incident at a Glendalough property on Tuesday night at around 11pm. Nine News reported he was involved in an alleged altercation and allegedly splashed petrol around the property and threw petrol at a man and a woman inside, before trying to set the property alight.

'I heard a loud slamming of a door and it's sounded like an alarm had gone off,' a neighbour told Nine News. It's not clear as to what caused the outburst and behaviour or his relationship to the two people. Kerr appeared briefly in Perth Magistrates Court on Wednesday where he was granted bail with conditions including a curfew between 7pm and 7am, and orders to stay away from the two complainants and two addresses. But early on Thursday, a spokesman for the Department of Corrective Services said Kerr remained in Hakea remand prison after he failed to pay his $5000 surety overnight. Details of the alleged incident and the identities of the complainants were not revealed in court. Lawyer John Prior said Kerr acknowledged the allegations were serious.

'We will continue to support Daniel, who was an outstanding player for this club, to get the help he needs to recover from this situation and to get his life back on track,' the club said. 'As this matter is now in the hands of police, the club has no further comment to make.' Kerr made his AFL debut in 2001 and played 220 games for the Eagles, his only club while in the AFL. He was a runner-up Brownlow medallist in 2005 and 2007, and won a premiership with the team in 2006. But he was plagued by a series of injuries after 2008 and retired from the AFL in 2013. Kerr's off-field indiscretions caused some controversy during his career including a scuffle with teammate Ben Cousins at a Perth nightclub and a prescription forgery scandal. While in 2007, Kerr and his father also got into strife at a party and he was charged with assault. Nine News reported Kerr could be dealt serious punishment for the charges if found guilty including up to three years behind bars and a $36,000 fine. The case has been adjourned until November 26.

"Opponents of George Lucas' plan to build a museum along Chicago's lakefront have filed a lawsuit branding it an 'assault on the shores of Lake Michigan'. It is the latest obstacle for the Star Wars creator's Lucas Museum of Narrative Art, a shrine his collection of art and movie memorabilia, after negotiations over a waterfront site fell through with San Francisco. The federal lawsuit filed on Thursday by Chicago advocacy group Friends of the Parks argues that the city has no authority to hand over the land, citing a legal principle known as the public trust doctrine. Projection: This is an architectural rendering of the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art that George Lucas plans to build along Chicago's lakefront. However, he is now facing legal action branding it an assault on the shore . That doctrine makes the state a trustee over natural resources and requires it to ensure open spaces are preserved and accessible to the public. Group president Cassandra Francis says members aren't against the museum, just its location along the lake. 'Chicago's lakefront is the envy of waterfront cities throughout the world,' she told reporters. 'The humongous scale of the museum is ... an assault to the shores of Lake Michigan.' Mayor Rahm Emanuel embraced the idea, and the city has offered to make the land available in a lease, with Lucas bankrolling construction and operation costs. Generations of activists have fought to keep Chicago's lakefront largely free from development and preserve it as public parkland and beaches. Latest obstacle: The Star Wars creator picked Chicago after being turfed out of his original San Francisco site . Renderings released this month, depict a flowing white building topped with a hovering ring. One city council member ridiculed it as looking like 'a palace for Jabba the Hutt.' The land is currently a parking lot south of Soldier Field, home of the Chicago Bears. But the lawsuit says that site, located within Burnham Park, consists entirely of land reclaimed from Lake Michigan, mostly in the 1920s. As such, it argues, the state of Illinois holds it as public trust property. 'Such trust property ... should be set aside and preserved ... for access to navigation, fishing and commerce on Lake Michigan,' the lawsuit says. Building a private museum on the site — even if the land is leased rather than sold — would violate the legal doctrine, it argues. A museum spokeswoman declined comment on the lawsuit. Emanuel's office did not respond to a request for comment. Lucas and the Chicago Park District argue project could create significant new green space and enhance recreational, cultural and educational amenities of an area known as the Museum Campus. It's already home to a natural history museum, an aquarium and a planetarium. Francis said it would set a bad precedent and that leaving the site a parking lot is preferable. 'Once we build a building in this location, it will be forever precluded as open space,' she said.","Star Wars creator chose Chicago after San Francisco site fell through .

"They are the heavyweights who lead the world’s 20 major and emerging economies. But just how intimidating are the G20 political giants in person and does their stature really make them more authoritative leaders? Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott stands at 5ft 9in, while Vladimir Putin - the Russian President who Abbott threatened to ‘shirtfront’ over the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 - is just 5ft 7in. However, both are often photographed with their shirts off and make-up for their moderate heights by taking pride in their sporting prowess and martial arts history. Scroll down for video . Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott stands at 5ft 9in, while Russian President Vladimir Putin is just 5ft 7in . American President Barack Obama is 6ft 1in, Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto is 5ft 7in and Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper towers above all the leaders at 6ft 2in . Mr Abbott, a former rugby forward turned avid cyclist, was awarded a 'blue' for his boxing prowess during his time at Oxford University. And while some of the myths around Putin are difficult to take seriously - he purportedly 'saved' a TV crew from a tiger several years ago - in reality, he is a judo master. British Prime Minister David Cameron and American President Barack Obama - vertically gifted politicians - are taller at 6ft 1in, and both take a more leisurely approach to life than Putin and Abbott. Barack is often spotted on the golf course – even on the same day that he addressed the ISIS beheading of top American war correspondent James Foley. And Cameron is the master of ‘chillaxing’, a phrase he coined to describe his time out on the tennis court or watching a TV box set with wife Samantha. How do the G20 leaders line-up?

The majestic 55-year-old is a grand 6ft 2in and towers over the likes of French President Francois Hollande at 5ft 7in. With all that height, Mr Harper is keen to remain stylish and is the first Canadian prime minister to employ a personal stylist, Michelle Muntean, to help co-ordinate his clothes. Mr Hollande, meanwhile, is the second diminutive French President in a row, but he is two inches taller than Nicolas Sarkozy, who was notoriously touchy about his size. In 2012, Hollande was left red-faced after an official visit to London when he was photographed next to rather taller guard of honour from the 1st Battalion of the Coldstream Guards. The guards' sizeable bearskins made the President appear tiny in the pictures taken outside the UK foreign office.

Two of the Asian leaders at the G20 - President of the People's Republic of China Xi Jinping, who lines up at 5ft 9in, and Japan’s leader Shinzo Abe, 5ft 10in – are both much taller than the average male citizen in their countries. An average Chinese man is 5ft 6in, whereas an average Japanese man is 5ft 7in. Meanwhile, female heavyweight Angela Merkel is 5ft 5in, the same height as Argentina’s Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, but they are both shorter than Brazil’s woman in charge Dilma Rousseff, who is 5ft 7in. Proving that good things don’t always come in small packages, the first world leader to touch down in Brisbane for the G20, South Africa’s President Jacob Zuma, is just 5ft 6in. Zuma has faced multiple corruption claims, has been married six times and is estimated to have 20 children.

But does a politician’s size really matter? According to a 2011 US study by Dr Gregg Murray at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, Texas, voters see tall politicians as the best people for the top job. Dr Murray asked volunteers to depict leaders and ordinary citizens and 64 per cent of participants drew the leaders taller. ‘Our ancestors lived in groups that were constantly engaged in conflicts that were resolved through physical violence,’ said the psychologist in an interview with the Guardian. ‘If you are in a group and the enemy hordes are coming over the hill, what you want them to see is the big person out front so they know they face a tough battle.’ President of South Korea Park Geun-hye is one of four female leaders in the G20 and President Jacob Zuma of South Africa stands at 5ft 6in . Who wore it better? Turkey's Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu and Italian Premier Matteo Renzi will give their views at the G20 . Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi (2nd left) is 5ft 10 in. He is seen here with other world leaders at the Myanmar International Convention Center in Myanmar's capital Naypyidaw on November 12, 2014 . In the Social Science Quarterly journal he said the findings of his ‘Caveman Politics’ study showed that not only did individuals tend to prefer leaders with greater physical stature but also ‘that males with greater physical stature are more likely to think of themselves as qualified to be a leader and, through this increased sense of efficacy, they are more likely to demonstrate interest in pursuing a leadership position’. The G20 leaders – in all their shapes and sizes – will descend on the Brisbane Convention and Exhibition Centre on 15 and 16 November to discuss the world’s economic issues. The summit comprises of 19 countries - Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States - plus the European Union. Each G20 president is also allowed to invite several guest countries each year.","The G20 leaders will descend on Brisbane this weekend to flex their political muscles .

"Premier League clubs will fly over 175,000 miles this summer to fulfil pre-season fixtures in all four corners of the globe. Despite there being just 34 days between the World Cup final and the start of the Premier League season, all but one of the 20 top flight clubs are jetting off overseas as part of their preparations. These whistle-stop tours underline once again the massive value clubs place on exploiting commercial opportunities in foreign markets, with Bangkok, New Zealand and the United States all on the agenda for English football's elite.

The air miles total of 176,164 miles is down on last year's record 199,701, with clubs seeming to take into consideration the physical demands of the World Cup on squad members - to a certain extent. But any hope of a decent rest, perhaps interspersed with a few local fixtures, is a pipedream for the players as they hurtle into another campaign. Surprisingly, Newcastle United and West Ham United are the biggest travellers, with each heading on two-match tours of New Zealand.

"Watching Home Alone will have most parents believe that a child should never be left alone, but one mother is challenging this idea. Lizzie Heiselt, a mother-of-three living in Brooklyn, New York, told MailOnline that she feels it's important for parents to draw the line between protecting their children and 'keep[ing] them from developing confidence and growing into their own capable person.' So, on occasion, she leaves her seven-year-old son in their apartment for short periods of time of 45 minutes or less, and she says the independence and confidence it gives him is well worth it. Parenting: Blogger and mother-of-three Lizzie Heiselt (pictured with her son) has sparked a heated debate after revealing that she sometimes leaves her seven-year-old son home alone for up to 45 minutes at a time . 'It's essential for kids to learn and be confident that they have the ability to take care of themselves and to fight their own battles - and to know that they have the support and confidence of their parents as well,' she explained. In Ms Heiselt's post on her blog the Mother Runner, she explains that her son is a homebody who is responsible, follows the rules and is happy to be on his own. Referring to him as Manchild because of his 'old soul', she says when he asked to be left at home while she went to the laundromat around the corner from their apartment building, she acquiesced - after first teaching him what to do in case of emergency, of course. 'It's essential for kids to learn and be confident that they have the ability to take care of themselves' On another instance, she took her two younger children for a run around Prospect Park, and again she let her son stay behind. 'I was gone for about . 45 minutes for the longer of the excursions, [and] by the end of that time, I . was a little bit anxious to get home,' she told MailOnline. 'He was starting to wonder when . we were getting back as well, so it seems we both felt that 45 minutes . was about our limit - for now.' Comfortable alone: The Brooklyn-based mom explains that her son is a homebody who is responsible and follows the rules, and he often asks to be left at home while she runs errands . She added that as he does it more frequently, he will likely get accustomed and 45 minutes won't seem like such a long time anymore. But until then, she doesn't want the experience to be uncomfortable for him. 'Not that he wouldn't be able to handle himself . in terms of following the rules or taking care of himself,' she clarifies. 'But more that . he would start to get anxious and worried, which I don't think is . terribly important for him to experience at this point in his life or in . this context.' Ms Heiselt has written that she is averse to the idea of 'helicopter parenting' - mothers and fathers who stifle their kids by being too involved in their lives - and instead encourages hers to learn and do things on their own. Independence: 'It's essential for kids to learn and be confident that they have the ability to take care of themselves and to fight their own battles,' she says . 'They need to have the ability to make their own decisions in life and to function without supervision,' she says. 'Getting . in the way of that maturing process can, I believe, cripple children as . they grow up and don't have the confidence or the knowledge of how to . handle problems as they arise.' 'Getting in the way of that maturing process can, I believe, cripple children as they grow up' Not only is it perfectly safe to leave your child alone, it's also perfectly legal - at least in the state of New York. According to the Child Protective Services website, there is no specific age limit when it comes to children being at home alone. 'Some children are responsible, intelligent, and independent enough to be left alone at 12 or 13 years of age,' it reads. Baby steps: She says as he gets older, he will likely get accustomed to being alone and 45 minutes won't seem like such a long time. But until then, she doesn't want the experience to be uncomfortable for him . 'Parents and guardians need to make intelligent, reasoned decisions regarding these matters.' For Ms Heiselt, she's confident that she has made the right decision for her son - although her feelings on the topic may be significantly different when her daughter, now two, is his age. 'I like to think that it would depend on the child, regardless of their gender, but I also know that little girls appear more vulnerable,' she admitted. 'I think when she gets to be that old I will first need to evaluate her temperament and decide if she has the maturity and awareness to handle that kind of responsibility.'","Mother-of-three Lizzie Heiselt says she occasionally leaves her 'homebody' seven-year-old son at home alone for up to 45 minutes .

"The son of a millionaire CEO was arrested for cocaine possession hours after his parents burned to death in a fire that was 'intentionally set', it has emerged. Matthew Sheridan, 40, was detained in the early hours of September 28 when police found cocaine, digital scales, and plastic bags in his car. His arrest came minutes after fire fighters were scrambled to a fatal fire in the five-bedroom home he shared with his parents, Cooper Health System CEO John Sheridan, 72, and his 69-year-old wife Joyce, in Skillman, New Jersey. Mysterious: John Sheridan, CEO of Cooper Health System, and his wife Joyce (both pictured in the bottom left corner) died in a house fire 'intentionally set'. Hour later, their son was arrested for cocaine possession . Authorities refrained from making the arrest public as they continue to probe the cause of the fire - but insist the cases are unrelated. And despite obtaining illegal substances, which carry a five-year jail term in New Jersey, the Prosecutor's Office ordered a bail unit to release the defendant and refused to authorize indictable charges. A family representative told The Philadelphia Inquirer: 'This is a private matter for Matt. 'It is entirely unrelated to the investigation of the death of Joyce and John Sheridan, and the family will have nothing more to say on the matter.' Last month, the prosecutor ruled Matthew and his three brothers - Mark, Dan and Tim - had no involvement in the fire that killed their parents shortly after 6am on September 28. The same statement confirmed they believe the fire, which was contained to the master bedroom, was 'set intentionally'. John Sheridan, a former state transport commissioner, and Joyce, a retired teacher, were found unconscious in the room. Hidden: Authorities did not make the arrest public and the prosecutor's office would not authorize charges . According to the report read by the Inquirer, Matthew Sheridan was arrested at 6.13am, in the same minute that a neighbor alerted police to the fire. However, the Prosecutor's Office claims the arrest was made later in the afternoon as Matthew Sheridan did not return from New York until midday. A spokesman attributed the discrepancy to human error. Charges were filed at 3pm but four days later authorities ordered a bail unit to 'release defendant from bail tracking' and refused to authorize indictable charges. The case is being reviewed by the office, which has five years to table a complaint that would lead to a charge. Rocco Cipparone Jr, a former federal prosecutor, told Philly.com that  'it's not typical [a drug charge] would be dismissed.'","Cooper Health System CEO John Sheridan, 72, and wife Joyce, 69, died in a fire at their 5-bedroom New Jersey home on September 28 at around 6am .

"They were issued to US soldiers by the military at the start of Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003 showing, in rank, the names and job descriptions of Saddam Hussein's government henchmen. But today, as the cards are seen on display in the Pentagon in Washington D.C., they are now not much more than collectors items. The majority of the 52 henchmen featured - including one woman then-known as 'Mrs Anthrax - have been either killed or captured. Several remain unaccounted for or at large. Ofcourse at the top was the Ace of Spades himself, President Saddam Hussein, who was captured in 2003 and executed in Iraq in December 2006.

The cards were developed by a team of five DIA Army intelligence officers and NCO's to help troops on the ground identify their enemy. It was an idea that dates as far back as the Civil War and World War II. The cards were officially named the 'Personality Identification Playing Cards' and went on to become a highly prized item for collectors. There were rumors at the time that only about 200 decks were printed. Each deck has two Jokers, one showing Iraqi military ranks and the other Arab tribal titles. Many card manufacturers have created their own versions of the deck, mimicking them in the best way possible. #1 Most-Wanted: Saddam Hussein (Ace of Spades) The Iraqi dictator was hanged in Baghdad on December 30, 2006. #2 Most-Wanted: Qusay Saddam Husayn (Ace of Clubs) Saddam Hussein's second-born son was killed during a US raid on his home in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul on July 22, 2003. #3 Most-Wanted: Uday Saddam Husayn (Ace of Hearts) Eldest son of Saddam Hussein was killed during the same raid on his brothers house, the Ace of Clubs Qusay Saddam Husayn. #4 Most-Wanted: Abid Hamid Mahmud al-Tikriti (Ace of Diamonds) The Iraqi military officer was executed by hanging in Iraq on June 7, 2012.

"Great Britain could today record its biggest Olympic gold medal haul for over a century. After scooping 19 golds in 2008 at Beijing, the host nation will surpass that total with just two more first place finishes. With gold medal contenders including Victoria Pendleton and Chris Hoy still to make individual quests for glory, Team GB could well be on for its best Games performance in 100 years. Sitting on top of the world: Alex Gregory, Pete Reed, Tom James and Andrew Triggs Hodge celebrate gold medal glory in the men's coxless fours at Eton Dorney on Saturday . Britain's Ben Ainslie, another 'king of the sitting down sports' waves the Union Jack after his sailing gold on Sunday . Equestrian star Ben Maher, who helped Team GB win gold yesterday, and cycling queen Victoria Pendleton have also contributed to Britain's success in 'sitting down sports' And after two thirds of Britain's medals were claimed in seated sports such as cycling, rowing, and horse riding, many have begun to declare Great Britain as 'king of the sitting down sports'. Hundreds of thousands of fans will be hoping British victories in the triathlon, dressage and cycling will boost Team GB's gold medal haul past the 19 achieved in Beijing four years ago. It was another triumphant day yesterday with cyclist Jason Kenny in the individual sprint and 54-year-old Nick Skelton, together with the rest of the showjumping team, keeping up the gold rush. Record haul: Great Britain need just a handful more medals to surpass their efforts in Beijing. Each left-hand bar shows the 2008 medal totals, while the right hand bars show the London 2012 medal haul as of yesterday . On the way: Britain need just two more golds to surpass the total of 19 they collected in Beijing . Yesterday confirmed Britain’s standing in third place in the medal table, some seven golds ahead of nearest rivals South Korea, and with 11 silver and 11 bronze they are 18 in front in total. If they can maintain that position ahead of Sunday’s closing ceremony it will be the best finish since 1920. Today, . it’s the turn of cycling stars Vicky Pendleton and Sir Chris Hoy to . head the cast going for glory as Britain carries on going Games crazy — . more than 20 million watched on television as Usain Bolt won Sunday . night’s explosive 100metres final. Pendleton bids to sign off with a second gold medal of London 2012 in the women's sprint that would make her Britain's most successful female Olympian with three gold medals. Sir Chris Hoy also goes for gold tonight in the men's keirin knowing victory would see him climb above Sir Steve Redgrave as Britain's most successful Olympian with six gold medals. 'We're phenomenally proud of them,' Brailsford told BBC Breakfast. 'They've been the backbone of British track cycling for a long time. 'This could be the very last competition for Vicky so it's quite a sad day for us in that respect. 'I do think she deserves special mention. 'She has worked so hard in the last three years to bring herself up to this level of competition.' Brailsford is understandably pleased with Britain's medal haul going into the final day of track cycling competition, with five track golds and one bronze already in the bag. 'It's been great so far. We've three medals available today and we're ready for them. I hope by the end of today we might have three more.' Laura Trott is the third British rider eyeing a gold medal tonight as she completes the omnium, and Brailsford also singled her out for praise. 'Laura is a bundle of energy. She's got this contagious enthusiasm. 'She's a brilliant bike rider and it would be great if she can finish off the job today.' Statistics revealed that of Team GB's first 37 medals, 66 per cent were in sitting down sports. Star . performances in equestrian, sailing, rowing and cycling have all . contributed to Team GB's impressive third place standing in the overall . medals table. By contrast, the two leading nations, China and the USA, both excel in non-sitting down sports. At the same stage the two nations had over 121 medals - with a sitting down element of just 7 per cent. Almost nine out of 10 people in the UK have watched some coverage of the London 2012 Olympics, officials said today. More than 50.572 million people, some 88% of the total number of people living in the UK, have tuned in as Britain closes in on its best Games in more than a century, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said. Timo Lumme, of the IOC’s television marketing services, said: 'I think London 2012 heralds a new era in Olympic broadcasting.' Glued to the screen: Supporters by the big screen in the Olympic Park, just some of the tens of millions who have tuned in to London 2012 across Britain . There are likely to be more than 100,000 hours of television footage of the Games, compared with 61,000 hours for Beijing four years ago, he said. Digital output, online and on mobile phones, is also expected to exceed the amount of television footage for the first time, he added. He said organisers believe London 2012 broadcasts will reach 'more viewers than ever before', with a global reach of 4.8 billion across every country in the world.","Two more golds will see Team GB surpass Beijing haul .

"Universities should discriminate against applicants from private schools, grammars and high-performing comprehensives, Government-funded research has suggested. The controversial study reccomends that universities should lower their entry requirements for pupils from non-selective and poor-performing state schools because they show more ‘potential’, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. These students are ‘significantly’ more likely to graduate with a first or 2.1 in their degree than peers from private or high-achieving state schools who gained similar results at GCSE and A-level, the study of millions of school-leavers found. The IFS says universities should lower their entry requirements for pupils from poor-performing state schools because they show more ‘potential . They are also less likely to drop out of their degree courses part-way through. The researchers, led by Dr Claire Crawford, claim that selective schools may be better at drawing out good results from their pupils - a so-called ‘teaching effect’. They say that university entry grades should be lowered for pupils at comprehensives, particularly schools where pupils make poor progress, ‘in order to equalise the potential of all students being admitted to university’. The study – published yesterday by his own department – will disturb Education Secretary Michael Gove who has warned that attempts to skew university admissions policies give weak schools an excuse to avoid improvement. In contrast, his colleagues at the Department for Business, David Willetts and Vince Cable, have urged universities to go further in introducing so-called ‘contextual’ admissions. But in a further finding, the study suggested that many costly initiatives aimed at encouraging less privileged youngsters to apply to university may have been wasted because they came too late in their school career. Efforts should instead be focused on encouraging pupils to choose appropriate GCSE subjects at 14 and boosting their achievement in them at 16. Universities are likely to use the study to justify schemes that involve making lower offers to pupils from certain schools or groups or giving them places ahead of more advantaged applicants. Education Secretary Michael Gove has warned that attempts to skew university admissions policies give weak schools an excuse to avoid improvement . Growing numbers of universities are adopting such policies but the research claims that ‘more could be done’. But critics claim the policies risk crude ‘social engineering’ and detract from attempts to boost academic standards in state schools. The new study will also add to confusion since separate research earlier this year claimed that those with top grades – mainly As at A_level – stood roughly the same chance of gaining a good degree regardless of whether they attended a state or private school. Only students with slightly lower grades – Bs and Cs – were more likely to do well at university if they came from a state school, according to findings from the Higher Education Funding Council. It also suggested that ‘contextual’ admissions policies which take into account the average performance of an applicant’s school are flawed. The performance of a school – whether high or low-achieving – was said to make little difference to a pupil’s chances of achieving a first or 2.1 at university. However in her report, Dr Crawford, a researcher at the IFS and assistant professor of economics at Warwick University, said universities ‘may wish to take into account a measure of school value-added’ – how much progress it helps pupils to make – ‘or school performance…when making their admissions offers’. The report said it could not recommend ‘specific changes that should be made to the entry offers of particular universities’. But it added: ‘These results provide suggestive evidence that universities may wish to consider lowering their entry requirements for pupils from non-selective or low-value-added state schools (relative to pupils from selective or high-value-added state schools, or independent schools) in order to equalise the potential of students being admitted from these different types of school.’ It said pupils from state grammars should be ‘excluded from receiving these lower offers’. According to the research, which tracked millions of school-leavers over several years, those from selective private or state schools or comprehensives with low numbers of pupils on free school meals are ‘significantly more likely to drop out, significantly less likely to complete their degree and significantly less likely to graduate with a first or a 2.1’ than their counterparts with similar results in non-selective or lower-performing schools. Among pupils with similar grades, pupils from selective independent schools were 6.4 percentage points less likely to complete their degree and 10.3 percentage points less likely to graduate with a first or 2.1. ‘Those from non-selective or low-value-added state schools could be regarded as having higher “potential” than those from selective or high-value-added state schools or independent schools’, the report said. It suggested that private and selective schools ‘may be better at producing good grades at GCSE for their pupils than others, meaning that a pupil of given ability will obtain higher grades at a selective school than a non-selective community school’. But it added that such schools may be preparing their pupils poorly for university study. ‘While independent or selective schools might be very successful at preparing students for GCSE and A-level (and equivalent) exams, they may be less good at preparing students for independent study at university,’ it said. Oxford University should consider introducing a ‘quota system’ to increase the number of state school pupils given places, according to one of its leading academics. Professor John Carey said the private school ‘stranglehold’ at Oxford was worsening and something ‘drastic’ needed to be done. The academic and literary critic, a product of the old grammar school system, said figures for entry to Oxford were ‘still shockingly in favour of private schools’. 'Stranglehold': Professor Carey said it is getting harder and harder for state school students to get in to Oxford. Pictured is University College . He told the Salisbury International Arts Festival: ‘It really should be considered whether you introduce a quota system. I do think something drastic has got to be done. I think that the private school stranglehold is actually getting worse. ‘It’s getting harder and harder for people from very ordinary schools to get in’. Professor Carey, 80, Oxford’s emeritus professor of English literature, acknowledged it was making efforts to encourage more state school applications but said more needed to be done, the Telegraph reported. Official figures show that most elite universities increased their intake of state school pupils in the year £9,000-a-year tuition fees were introduced, with only five – including Oxford – seeing the proportion decline.","IFS says the best universities should prioritise pupils from poor schools .

"While shop mannequins in the UK were criticised recently for being too thin, a window display in Venezuela is attracting a different kind of controversy by featuring pregnant children. Three dummies have been placed in a shopping mall in Caracas showing children with bulging stomachs dressed in over-sized school uniforms as part of a 'back to school' display. The figurines were designed by two children's charities attempting to raise awareness of the country's child pregnancy rate, which is among the highest in South America. Problem: Two children's charities teamed up to produce the shocking display, which is designed to highlight Venezuela's child pregnancy rate which is among the highest in South America . Disgust: The designers say that while some people praise the mannequins for drawing attention to the problem of child pregnancy, others have complained . One schoolgirl under the age of 18 becomes pregnant every three minutes, while 23 per cent of all births fall into the under-18s category, according to the charities. Auriselvia Torrealba, 20, a student who passed the mannequins, said: 'Yes, it's disturbing to see in a window. But it's the truth. 'You see pregnant girls all the time on the streets. So this forces you to think about the problem, doesn't it?' But her friend Kelly Hernandez, 18, disagreed, adding: 'I think it's horrible, awful. If I was a mother, I wouldn't want my child to see that.' Venezuela's socialist government insists that education and children's rights have improved greatly since it came to power 15 years ago. However charities and non-government organisations say that not enough is being done to educate children about sex, and that parents also need to take the issue more seriously. That is why charities Fundana and Construyendo Futuros decided to launch their latest campaign, and say they are delighted with the controversy it has attracted. Shock: One girl under the age of 18 becomes pregnant every three minutes in Venezuela, while a quarter of all births in the country fall into that age group, according to the charities . Thalma Cohen, president of Construyendo Futuros, said: 'It's amazing seeing people react as they walk by. This is such a taboo subject in Venezuela, we want people to talk about it. 'Some people get angry and complain. Others congratulate us.' The mannequins will be on display for the next month and may be taken to other malls around the nation of 30million people. It comes days after a United Nations women's rights watchdog expressed 'deep concern' over Venezuela's high number of teenage pregnancies and maternal mortality. According to the most recent U.N. data, Venezuela had an adolescent birth rate of 101 per 1,000 women aged 15 to 19, one of the highest in Latin America, in 2010. For every 100,000 live births that took place, 92 women died in labour. The risks to adolescent mothers of death or serious injury is significantly higher than women in their late teens or twenties.","'Back to school' display features pregnant children wearing uniforms .

"Cat lovers in Northern California are pouncing at the chance of spending time with feline company at a new cat cafe in Oakland. Cat Town Cafe is giving dozens of visitors a chance to mingle with furry friends while sipping coffee and nibbling on cat-themed cookies. The cafe opened last month and has been full since opening day. It was inspired by the cat cafe craze in Japan, where many people live in cramped high-rise apartments that don't allow pets. Scroll down for video . Peek-a-boo: Dawn Piper moves in to take a closer look at a pair of cats in a tower at the Cat Town Cafe in Oakland, California . While making feline friends became popular therapy for lonely or anxious workers in Japan, the Oakland coffee shop puts the focus on the animals. The tuxedo, orange tabby and Siamese cats napping or stretching in the sun in Cat Town come from a local shelter and are available for adoption. 'Most of them have been at the shelter for four months or more. Global influence: Pouncing on similar cafe concepts in Asia and Europe, the cafe has become America's first permanent feline-friendly coffee shop . Novel experience: Cafe customers pay to pet cute kitties while sipping on tea or expresso drinks . Close encounter: It allows customers, who may not be able to have cats in their own homes, to enjoy the benefits of furry friends for short times without the responsibility . 'So as much as this is a super fun experience, it's really a mission-driven project to get the cats out of the shelter and into great homes,' said Ann Dunn, founder of Cat Town Oakland. The nonprofit group  helps place cats least likely to be adopted from the Oakland Animal Shelter. She said there were 14 adoptions in their first 12 days. For a $10 donation to the organization, visitors get one hour of kitty company in the cafe, where they can play with felines, scratch their backs and watch them nap. Each person is given a designated window of time to make sure there are not too many people at once in the room painted with cartoon-like, bright murals of cats. Take me home! The animals come from a local animal shelter and are also available for adoption . Trendsetter: This may just be the beginning of this country's cat cafe craze as others plan on opening soon in Seattle, Portland, San Diego and Denver . Reason to smile: In this photo taken Thursday, November 6, Jo Anne Driscoll, left, and Peggy Harding, right, watch others play with cats . Cat naps are very popular at the cafe, but Christina Souza, who visited on a recent afternoon, didn't seem to mind. 'I think it's fun. It's great. It's exciting,' Souza said. 'Why not have more venues where cats can let out their fun personalities?' Cat cafes are now open in London, Vienna and Paris. However, Cat Town's founders believe their coffee shop is the first of its kind in the United States. That may change soon - a half dozen cat cafes are set to open in the U.S. next year, most of them along the West Coast. Wait your turn: Each person is given a designated window of time to make sure there are not too many people at once in the room painted with cartoon-like, bright murals of cats .

"For decades, researchers have been trying in vain to decipher ancient texts written on the Voynich manuscript - and a British researcher claims he has cracked it. The world-renowned 600 year old manuscript is full of illustrations of exotic plants, stars, and mysterious human figures, as well as many pages written in an unknown text. Now Stephen Bax, Professor of Applied Linguistics at the University of Bedfordshire, say he has decoded words in it for the first time. Scroll down for video . Stephen Bax, Professor of Applied Linguistics at the University of Bedfordshire, say he has decoded words in it for the first time by identifying the plants . Up until now the 15th century cryptic work has baffled scholars, cryptographers and codebreakers who have failed to read a single letter of the script or any word of the text. Over time it has attained an infamous reputation, even featuring in the latest hit computer game Assassin’s Creed, as well as in the Indiana Jones novels, when Indiana decoded the Voynich and used it to find the ‘Philosopher's Stone’. However in reality no one has come close to revealing the Voynich’s true messages unitl now. Many grand theories have been proposed. Some suggest it was the work of Leonardo da Vinci as a boy, or secret Cathars, or the lost tribe of Israel, or most recently Aztecs … some have even proclaimed it was done by aliens. Professor Bax is using linguistic analysis to work on the script letter by letter . 'I hit on the idea of identifying proper names in the text, following historic approaches which successfully deciphered Egyptian hieroglyphs and other mystery scripts, and I then used those names to work out part of the script,' he said. 'The manuscript has a lot of illustrations of stars and plants. I was able to identify some of these, with their names, by looking at medieval herbal manuscripts in Arabic and other languages, and I then made a start on a decoding, with some exciting results.' Among the words he has identified is the term for Taurus, alongside a picture of seven stars which seem to be the Pleiades, and also the word KANTAIRON alongside a picture of the plant Centaury, a known mediaeval herb, as well as a number of other plants. Altogether Bax says he has worked out: Juniper,Taurus, Coriander, Centaurea, Chiron, Hellebore Nigella Sativa, Kesar and Cotton. Although Professor Bax admits his decoding is still only partial, it has generated a lot of excitement in the world of codebreaking and linguistics because it could prove a crucial breakthrough for an eventual full decipherment. 'My aim in reporting on my findings at this stage is to encourage other linguists to work with me to decode the whole script using the same approach, though it still won’t be easy. 'That way we can finally understand what the mysterious authors were trying to tell us,' he added. 'But already my research shows conclusively that the manuscript is not a hoax, as some have claimed, and is probably a treatise on nature, perhaps in a Near Eastern or Asian language.' The word cotton was one of the first to be decoded, after the plant was identified and a word on the page translated as kooton . The research also uncovered the name of the Centaur Chiron . Recently a U.S. botanist studied illustrations of the plants throughout the 15th century book and pinpointed a number of them to the Central American region now known as Mexico. Dr. Arthur Tucker claims at least 37 of the 303 plants would have grown in the region during the 15th and 16th century and believes the text is, therefore, written in the Aztec language of Nahuatl. Nahuatl originated in Central Mexico during the 7th century. It was the spoken predominantly by the Aztecs. Following the Spanish conquest of Mexico in the 16th century, the alphabet was replaced with Latin. Nahuatl became a literary language, used in poetry and passages, similar to the Voynich manuscript. Varieties of Nahuatl are still spoken by approximately 1.5 million Nahua people in Central Mexico. The writing is so bizarre, sceptics have stated the book is a hoax or that the writing is nonsense. The Voynich manuscript was discovered in an Italian monastery in 1912 by book dealer Wilfred Voynich. Carbon dating suggests the manuscript was created between approximately 1404 and 1438, during the Italian Renaissance. The 240 pages of the book are made from a type of parchment produced using calf skin, known as vellum, and are decorated with illustrations, diagrams and a mysterious text written from left to right. Examples include the illustration of the Ipomoea murucoides, top left, taken from the Mexican Codex Cruz-Badianus which has an identical style to the Ipomoea arborescens in the manuscript, bottom left. A Voynich illustration of a cactus pad or fruit, right, is shown near the name ‘nashtli’, which Dr. Tucker and Talbert claim is a variant of the word ‘nochtil’ - the Nahuatl name for the fruit of the prickly pear . If the text, pictured far left, is written in the language of Nahuatl, the botanists claim they can find the name of the plants in the manuscript. From this, cryptographers may be able to form a basic code from which to crack the rest of the text in the 15th century book . Due to its mysterious nature, the text has been studied by cryptographers around the world, yet no-one has succeeded in deciphering the reams of written passages. Dr. Arthur Tucker from Delaware University took a different approach, and instead, studied the plants depicted throughout the book. He discovered similarities between specific plants in the manuscript and illustrations of plants he had spotted in his collection of 16th century Mexican records. The Voynich manuscript was discovered in an Italian monastery in 1912 by book dealer Wilfred Voynich. Carbon dating suggests the manuscript was created in the early 15th century, between approximately 1404 and 1438, during the Italian Renaissance.

Each page is decorated with illustrations, diagrams and a mysterious text written from left to right. Due to its mysterious nature, the text has been studied by cryptographers around the world, yet no-one has succeeded in deciphering the reams of written passages. This has led to many people claim the book is hoax, or that the writing is nonsense. Due to the manuscript’s discovery in Italy, many researchers believe the book to have originated in Europe, however, the latest research from Dr. Tucker suggests it may have been written by the Aztecs in what is now modern-day Mexico. For example, Dr. Tucker and fellow researcher Rexford Talbert said one plant in the book bears a resemblance to the picture of a soap plant (xiuhamolli) seen in a Mexican codex from 1552. While another example includes the illustration of the Ipomoea murucoides, taken from the Mexican Codex Cruz-Badianus, which has an identical style to the Ipomoea arborescens in the manuscript. In total, the researchers linked 37 of the 303 plants in the manuscript to illustrations in ancient Mexican books covering botany across Texas, California and Nicaragua. Due to its mysterious nature, the text and diagrams in the manuscript, pictured, have been studied by cryptographers around the world, yet no-one has succeeded in deciphering the reams of written passages.  This has led to many people claim the book is hoax, or that the writing is nonsense . Nahuatl, pictured here written in the Florentine Codex, originated in Central Mexico during the 7th century. It was spoken predominantly by the Aztecs . If the text is written in the language of Nahuatl, the botanists claim they can find the name of the plants in . the manuscript and may be able to use these to form a basic code from which to . crack the rest of the text.

"Google has beaten Facebook to buy drone firm Titan Aerospace in a bid to to bring the internet to the developing world. Facebook had been expected to acquire the firm - but today Google revealed it had pipped them to the post. The firm hopes to use the drones to bring internet access to large parts of the developing world, alongside its Project Loon balloon project. In April, Google also acquired Titan Aerospace, which is building solar-powered drones (pictured) to provide similar connectivity . Power: Titan Aerospace's drone is covered in around 3,000 solar panels producing about 7 kW of electricity - it flies above the clouds, so it is exposed to sunlight constantly during daylight hours. Wingspan and payload: 60 metres wide. The Solara 60 carries a payload of 250 pounds. Speed: Cruising speed for the Solara is about 65 mph. Function: The drone can be used for surveillance, crop-monitoring, weather and disaster oversight - or to provide communication, which is what Facebook is said to be interested in. Distance: The unmanned craft will have an operating range of over 2.8 million miles. 'It's still early days, but atmospheric satellites could help bring internet access to millions of people, and help solve other problems, including disaster relief and environmental damage like deforestation,' a Google spokesman said in a statement. The firm has not said how much it paid for the firm, which will remain in New Mexico. Titan is developing two dragonfly-shaped drones, both of which use batteries charged by wing-mounted solar panels to remain aloft at night. The smaller model, called the Solara 50, has a wingspan of 164 feet, slightly larger than a Boeing 767. The firm's drones can fly for upto five years at a time. It had previously been reported Facebook was about to buy the firm. The company was said to be interested in using the Solara 60 model, which is light-weight solar-powered and can fly at 65,000 feet for five years non-stop. The Solara unmanned aircraft is 60 metres wide and self-sufficient as it is covered in around 3,000 solar panels producing about 7 kW of electricity. As it flies above the clouds, it is exposed to sunlight constantly during daylight hours and store energy for the night flight. The drones are described as ‘atmospheric satellites’ that could be used for surveillance, to monitor weather and communications. The smaller model, called the Solara 50, has a wingspan of 164 feet, slightly larger than a Boeing 767. Facebook is interested in the latter function and reportedly thinks the drones could be used to provide sustainable regional internet systems. However, this would mean all its drones would be used for the Internet.org project, which is competing with Google’s ‘Project Loon’. Google’s effort plans on using balloons instead of drones to bring internet access to rural and remote areas of the world - and nwill now include the Titan drones. The Solara unmanned aircraft 9pictured) is 60 metres wide and self-sufficient as it is covered in around 3,000 solar panels producing about 7 kW of electricity . Experts have pointed out that Facebook’s recent acquisition of WhatsApp could be used to send messages in places with a weak and slow internet connection, while a data compression technology it bought, Onavo, could be used so that functions need less transmitted data to make them work. While Facebook’s aim is altruistic, the company would also seem to be looking to the future, as by connecting communities, more people than ever before will get hooked on social media. Titan Aerospace’s Solara 50 and Solara 60 drones are currently demonstrator models that can be flown and are launched in catapult, but commercial versions are expected next year. They are designed to be cheaper than the cost of a satellite, while carrying out similar functions such as surveillance, crop-monitoring, weather and disaster oversight. The drones (pictured) are described as 'atmospheric satellites' that could be used for surveillance, to monitor weather and communications. Facebook is interested in using them to provide internet access to remote areas of land below . The Institution of Engineering and Technology's deputy president, Professor William Webb, said: 'The idea of using aerial platforms to deliver connectivity is one that is many decades old, from low-orbital satellites to balloons and more recently unmanned aerial vehicles.' 'The difficultly has always been one of keeping the aerial platform in the right place in the sky for weeks or months at a low enough cost. As technologies mature we get ever closer to achieving this.' He warned that there are many challenges to overcome before the dream of providing internet access to remote communities via drone can be achieved. 'Top of the list is the need to make the drones cost-effective, reliable and demonstrate to the regulators that they can operate safely in our airspace. 'Many other issues associated with access to radio spectrum, national telecoms regulations and more will also need to be addressed,' he added.","Titan Aerospace developing a range of drones long flying drones .

There are currently 81 members in the closed Facebook group for Sean Petrozzino. According to the affiliate station, in the Facebook group Cynthia Petrozzino mentions on the group page the couple's 2014 split, as well as their first meeting as high school students, correspondence throughout college as well as how they eventually started a relationship together. 'Unfortunately in 2014 our problems grew and mistakes never went away. We separated because I thought we would be better off apart and we had been unhappy for awhile,' she wrote, according to The Orlando Sentinel. Split: Cynthia Petrozzino wrote online 'We separated because I thought we would be better off apart and we had been unhappy for awhile' The newspaper reported that 'Remembering Sean Petrozzino' was open on Wednesday - and was closed the next day. The Orlando Sentinel also reported that Sean Petrozzino left the home he shared with his wife in order to live with mother Nancy Pertrozzino, 64, and father Michael Petrozzino, 63, the week ahead of their deaths. Cynthia Petrozzino's Facebook page still lists her as married to her husband. It also shows that her mother-in-law had commented on several of her pictures offering well-wishes in September. For a photo uploaded on September 23 showing fall leaves, Nancy Petrozzino commented 'Hope you're getting back to some normalcy in your life. Still thinking of you and praying for you, too. Love you.' A second user, Courtney Frazier, commented 'Thinking about you.' Nancy Petrozzino also commented on her daughter-in-law's September 21 picture with an unidentified male, writing 'Take care, Cindi. We love you.' Sean Petrozzino, 30, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head while he was being stopped by police in a Memphis neighborhood for making an illegal U-turn on Monday. Police officers said they heard a 'pop' sound as they exited their car and found the driver dead. A semi-automatic pistol was found in the vehicle. Detectives from the Orange County Sheriff's Office had been looking for Petrozzino since the bodies of Nancy Petrozzino, 64, and Michael Petrozzino, 63, were found inside their Orlando home on November 4. Michael Petrozzino had three gunshot wounds to the abdomen and another three to the head, a spokeswoman for the medical examiner's office in Orlando said Wednesday, and Nancy Petrozzino was struck three times in the torso. Mourners: There are currently 80 members in the closed Facebook group for Sean Petrozzino, seen here with his wife Cynthia Petrozzino . Illness: Sean Petrozzino survived a devastating bacterial infection that left him a quadruple amputee as a teenager, and he has two prosthetic legs . Surveillance: A photo of Petrozzino at a bank ATM on the day his parents were shot shows him without any prosthetics for his hands . Deputies went to the home after colleagues at the school where Nancy Petrozzino taught second-grade became concerned when she didn't show up. Michael Petrozzino worked at Walt Disney World. 'I have a teacher who has not reported for work and has not responded to any messages or calls,' said the female caller to a dispatcher in a 911 call released Wednesday. 'Her husband isn't answering his phone either.' Memphis police said the vehicle Sean Petrozzino was driving was registered to the couple, but the tags did not match the car, which previously had been identified as a 2012 Toyota Camry. The gun found in the car wasn't the murder weapon, which was a high-powered rifle, Orange County authorities said Wednesday. It was not immediately clear what Petrozzino was doing in Memphis. Memphis police spokeswoman Karen Rudolph said in a news release on Wednesday that investigators from Florida came to Tennessee to help identify the body 'due to the fact that the victim is a quadruple amputee and we were unable to confirm through fingerprints.' Parents: The bodies of Nancy Petrozzino, 64, and Michael Petrozzino, 63, were found inside their Orlando home on November 4 . Cynthia Petrozzino wrote online 'Unfortunately in 2014 our problems grew and mistakes never went away' Sean Petrozzino survived a devastating bacterial infection that left him a quadruple amputee as a teenager. He had two prosthetic legs. A photo of him at a bank ATM on the day his parents were shot shows him without any prosthetics for his hands. The photo was released by the Orange County Sheriff's Office, and an agency spokeswoman said she didn't have information on whether Petrozzino used prosthetics for his hands. The South Florida Sun Sentinel wrote an article about the Petrozzino family in 2000 after Sean Petrozzino recovered from meningitis, which resulted in the amputation of his hands and feet while he was in high school. The family lived in Pembroke Pines, a suburb of Fort Lauderdale. It would be difficult, though not impossible, for Sean Petrozzino to fire a gun without using prosthetics, said Doug Pringle, chief operating officer of Prosthetic Consulting Services, near Reno, Nevada. 'It would be unlikely he could get something around the trigger,' Pringle said. A phone number for Cynthia Petrozzino was not accepting messages on Wednesday, the AP reported. Public records show they had lived in the Orlando area, and most recently in Cobb County, Georgia, which is north west of Atlanta. In the 2000 article, Michael Petrozzino told the newspaper that he was proud of his son's positive attitude adjusting to his changed world. 'I don't want anyone to feel sorry for me,' Sean Petrozzino said in the profile. 'As much as I feel bad about what happened, I feel good that my family and friends stood by me.'","Cynthia Petrozzino is the sole administrator for the closed group, 'Remembering Sean Petrozzino'

"An 'outstanding' inner-city academy is to be investigated over claims non-Muslim staff are being treated unfairly and staff are attempting to introduce Islamic studies to the curriculum. Non faith-based Park View Academy in the Alum Rock area of Birmingham was the first academy in Britain to be rated 'outstanding' by Ofsted. It will now be investigated by Department of Education (DfE) officials following a complaint by an employee. The complaint is believed to include . claims non-Muslim staff are being treated unfairly at the state school - . which also manages two other schools in the city. Park View Academy will be investigated following claims non-Muslim teachers are being treated unfairly and that the school is attempting to teach Islamic studies. It was Britain's first 'outstanding' rated Academy . The unnamed employee also claims the school has been attempting to introduce Islamic studies on to the curriculum, it is believed. This is not the first time the DfE has received a complaint about the school. In 2013 Ofsted was informed the school ruled female students were not to be taught tennis by male teachers. Today, the department said they were aware of the concerns surrounding the school and they will take firm action is any breaches of statutory public sector equality duty are found. The case will no doubt draw comparisons to controversies surrounding Britain's first Muslim free school - the Al-Madinah school in Derby, which will now stop teaching in summer. The Government was forced to step in after an Ofsted report warned the academy in Derby was in chaos. The schools inspectorate report . detailed concerns over quality of teaching and the curriculum at the . academy, amid claims it was imposing strict Islamic practices such as . forcing women to wear headscarves. Schools . minister Lord Nash said at the time: ‘It would simply not be in the . interests of parents or pupils at the secondary school to continue to . fund provision which has failed them in the manner now apparent.’ A source in Whitehall told The Sunday Times the DfE did not want the school to 'become another Al-Madinah'. They added the department were keen to make sure the school was still viewed as one of the best in the country. Lindsey Clark, Park View's executive head, said faith classes were being organised - but for after school lessons. She said it was a 'safeguarding issue' for children being hit in local madrasahs. She said a large number of Muslims worked among a mixed workforce at the school. She did however admit the school's governors ruled female pupils must only be taught my female teachers. A statement on the school's website read: 'Our intake is multicultural, with the vast majority of our pupils being of the Islamic faith background. Over many years the academy has worked hard to respect and serve its pupils, its parents and the local community with a relentless focus on improving educational standards. 'Staff at Park View share in the passion for excellence and are committed to the success of all the children and families we serve. This commitment includes striving to ensure that all our policies and practices meet all required legislation and statutory guidance at all levels. Britain's first Muslim free school - the Al-Madinah school in Derby. It will stop teaching this summer to concerns over teaching and the curriculum as well as claims women were being made to wear head scarves . 'The misleading and inaccurate representations in the media are an unhelpful distraction from our core purpose which is to enable the pursuit of excellence, recognition of abilities and talent, and the realisation of ambitions for all of our learners. 'In so doing, we aspire to break the link between demographics, deprivation and destiny. In addition we would like to make the following clarifications with respect to the allegations in the media. 'In common with the majority of secondary schools, P.E. at Park View School is taught in single-gender groups and by same-gender teachers. The job role of a teacher of P.E. is often advertised as gender-specific and is exempt under schedule 9 part 1 of the Equality Act 2010. All other subjects are taught by male & female teachers without regard to gender. 'Park View follows the Birmingham Agreed R.E Syllabus in years 7 & 8 and then from year 9, pupils are prepared for the Edexcel GCSE in Religious Education. 'Park View strictly complies with its recruitment policy which is fully compliant with legal requirements and is observant of fairness and meritocracy in process and practice.' The DfE said: 'We are aware of concerns around this school and are looking into the issues raised. All state schools must comply with the statutory public sector equality duty. 'We will not hesitate to take firm action if breaches of these requirements occur. It would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage.'","Park View Academy in Alum Rock, Birmingham, will be investigated by DfE .

"Investigation: An inquest said the true details of Mr Duggan's death could take six months to emerge . Mark Duggan - the police shooting victim whose death sparked riots in Tottenham - did not fire at officers before he was killed, tests have suggested. Ballistic analysis has indicated that a handgun found at the scene where Mr Duggan was killed by police had not been used, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) revealed today. The 29-year-old, said to be a key member of a crack-dealing gang, died from a single gunshot wound to the chest last Thursday. It was the trigger for Saturday night's rioting in Tottenham which, in turn, led to the further unrest on Sunday and last night. Investigations show that Mr Duggan's death came after two shots were fired by a Scotland Yard CO19 firearms officer. The initial results confirmed reports that a bullet found lodged in a police radio at the scene was police issue. Forensic officers have told the IPCC that it may not be possible to 'say for certain' whether the handgun found near Mr Duggan was fired. Inquiry: The Independent Police Complaints Commission has now launched an investigation into the shooting at Tottenham Hale . But an IPCC statement said: 'At this . stage there is no evidence that the handgun found at the scene was fired . during the incident.' The IPCC said investigation into the circumstances of the shooting were continuing with a CCTV trawl of the area. Mr Duggan was a passenger in a silver . Toyota Estima people carrier minicab in Ferry Lane, close to Tottenham . Hale Tube station, which was believed to have been stopped by police. Earlier it had been revealed Mr Duggan was carrying a blank-firing handgun converted to fire live bullets when he was killed. The father-of-four was armed with the pistol converted to fire live bullets when he was shot by armed police officers. Such a weapon is popular among London's drug gang members. Grieving: Semone Wilson, fiancee of Mark Duggan, arrives at North London Coroner's Court, High Barnet, for the opening of the 29-year-old's inquest . Reports . have claimed that Mr Duggan did not open fire on police before he was . shot dead at close range by a specialist firearms officer. At the opening of the inquest into his death, it was revealed that Mr Duggan was killed by a single gunshot wound to the chest. He . died last Thursday evening 15 minutes after reportedly sending a text . to his partner Semone Wilson saying: 'The Feds are following me'. It was also revealed at Mr Duggan's inquest that the investigation into the 29-year-old's death may take up to six months. While the shooting is being investigated the family may not receive any details of what happened to Mr Duggan. Mr Duggan's body was released for the family to prepare for the funeral. Mr Duggan was shot dead by armed officers from Operation Trident in Ferry Lane, Tottenham, shortly after 6pm on Thursday evening. His death sparked three nights of rioting which began after a vigil outside Tottenham police station on Saturday evening. North London Coroners officer Sandra Claxton said: 'On Thursday August 4th at 18.15 as a result of a pre-planned police operation by officers from Trident, he was stopped in a mini-cab in Ferry Lane. 'Police stopped the vehicle and then shots were fired resulting in his death. 'On August 5th a post mortem was carried out at Haringey mortuary. The cause of death was a gunshot wound to the chest. 'Mr Duggan was formally identified by his family on August 6th.' Coroner Andrew Walker, opening the inquest, said: 'I have reasonable . cause to suspect that he died in circumstances that require an inquest.' Long wait: Lawyer Marcia Willis-Stewart (left) and Helen Shaw, of the charity Inquest, make a statement after being told Mr Duggan's death investigation could last six months . Fatal: Mr Duggan was shot dead by police in north London in an incident where an officer was also wounded . Deputy . Senior Investigator Colin Sparrow, from the IPCC, told the hearing: . 'This is a complex investigation and yes, I request an adjournment.' Mr Walker agreed to an adjournment, asking: 'How long do you need to prepare your report and investigation?' Mr Sparrow replied: 'It is in its early stages, but I would say four to six months.' Mr Duggan's fiancée Semone Wilson . looked unhappy and shook her head when she heard how long the family . would have to wait until the full details of how Mr Duggan was killed . are revealed. Mr Duggan's . family said after the hearing they were 'deeply distressed' by the riots . which swept London and other parts of the country in the aftermath of . his death. Helen Shaw, from . charity Inquest, making a statement on behalf of the family outside . North London Coroner's Court this morning, said: 'The family have asked . me to say we came to the opening of the inquest today. Inferno: Duggan's death sparked riots throughout Tottenham which proved incredibly destructive . Police: Officers had numerous show-downs with protestors angry at Duggan's death . 'The investigation is ongoing and we want to establish the truth. 'The family want everyone to know that the disorder going on has nothing to do with finding out what happened to Mark.

"Facebook is rumoured to be acquiring a company that makes solar-powered drones. And while many people might be worried that the social network could spy on them from the skies, a more altruistic purpose is driving the company’s acquisition bid. Facebook is tipped to spend up to $60million on buying Texas-based Titan Aerospace, which makes drones that can fly solo for five years without needing to land, in order to bring affordable internet access to some five billion people who don’t have it. In April, Google also acquired Titan Aerospace, which is building solar-powered drones (pictured) to provide similar connectivity . Power: Titan Aerospace's drone is covered in around 3,000 solar panels producing about 7 kW of electricity - it flies above the clouds, so it is exposed to sunlight constantly during daylight hours. Wingspan and payload: 60 metres wide. The Solara 60 carries a payload of 250 pounds. Speed: Cruising speed for the Solara is about 65 mph. Function: The drone can be used for surveillance, crop-monitoring, weather and disaster oversight - or to provide communication, which is what Facebook is said to be interested in. Distance: The unmanned craft will have an operating range of over 2.8 million miles. TechCrunch has reported that the social network, which is a backer of the Internet.org initiative, is interested in using some 11,000 high altitude drones to bring internet access to rural Africa and other parts of the world that are not connected. The company is said to be interested in using the Solara 60 model, which is light-weight solar-powered and can fly at 65,000 feet for five years non-stop. The Solara unmanned aircraft is 60 metres wide and self-sufficient as it is covered in around 3,000 solar panels producing about 7 kW of electricity. Facebook is a backer of the Internet.org initiative and is rumoured to be interested in using 11,000 high altitude drones to bring internet access to remote regions of Africa and other parts of the world that are not online. Kenya's first call centre, which opened in 2005, is pictured, but plenty of parts of the continent do not have internet access . As it flies above the clouds, it is exposed to sunlight constantly during daylight hours and store energy for the night flight. The drones are described as ‘atmospheric satellites’ that could be used for surveillance, to monitor weather and communications. Facebook is interested in the latter function and reportedly thinks the drones could be used to provide sustainable regional internet systems. A source told TechCrunch that if Titan Aerospace was acquired, all its drones would be used for the Internet.org project, which is competing with Google’s ‘Project Loon’. Google’s effort plans on using balloons instead of drones to bring internet access to rural and remote areas of the world. The Solara unmanned aircraft 9pictured) is 60 metres wide and self-sufficient as it is covered in around 3,000 solar panels producing about 7 kW of electricity . Experts have pointed out that Facebook’s recent acquisition of WhatsApp could be used to send messages in places with a weak and slow internet connection, while a data compression technology it bought, Onavo, could be used so that functions need less transmitted data to make them work. While Facebook’s aim is altruistic, the company would also seem to be looking to the future, as by connecting communities, more people than ever before will get hooked on social media. Titan Aerospace’s Solara 50 and Solara 60 drones are currently demonstrator models that can be flown and are launched in catapult, but commercial versions are expected next year. They are designed to be cheaper than the cost of a satellite, while carrying out similar functions such as surveillance, crop-monitoring, weather and disaster oversight. The drones (pictured) are described as 'atmospheric satellites' that could be used for surveillance, to monitor weather and communications. Facebook is interested in using them to provide internet access to remote areas of land below . The Institution of Engineering and Technology's deputy president, Professor William Webb, said: 'The idea of using aerial platforms to deliver connectivity is one that is many decades old, from low-orbital satellites to balloons and more recently unmanned aerial vehicles.' 'The difficultly has always been one of keeping the aerial platform in the right place in the sky for weeks or months at a low enough cost. As technologies mature we get ever closer to achieving this and Facebook's intervention in this space is a welcome boost to the area.' He warned that there are many challenges to overcome before the dream of providing internet access to remote communities via drone can be achieved. 'Top of the list is the need to make the drones cost-effective, reliable and demonstrate to the regulators that they can operate safely in our airspace. Many other issues associated with access to radio spectrum, national telecoms regulations and more will also need to be addressed,' he added.","Facebook is tipped to buy Texas-based Titan Aerospace .

"Not content with spending $2bn on virtual reality company Oculus this week, Mark Zuckerberg has revealed that Facebook's future is even more sci-fi. In a post he revealed solar-powered drones, satellites and lasers are all being developed in the firm's labs to deliver the internet to underdeveloped countries. He has pledged to work on technology to deliver the internet to 'the next 3 billion people' - and revealed the firm has hired experts in solar power that can keep drones flying for months at a time.

'For all of these systems, the team is looking at Free-space optical communication, or FSO, is a way of using light to transmit data through space using invisible, infrared laser beams.' source: internet.org . 'In our effort to connect the whole world with Internet.org, we've been working on ways to beam internet to people from the sky,' he wrote. 'Today, we're sharing some details of the work Facebook's Connectivity Lab is doing to build drones, satellites and lasers to deliver the internet to everyone. 'Our goal with Internet.org is to make affordable access to basic internet services available to every person in the world.' 'We've made good progress so far. 'Over the past year, our work in the Philippines and Paraguay alone has doubled the number of people using mobile data with the operators we've partnered with, helping 3 million new people access the internet.' However, he admitted that new technology was the key to expanding the internet's reach. 'We're going to continue building these partnerships, but connecting the whole world will require inventing new technology too. 'That's what our Connectivity Lab focuses on, and there's a lot more exciting work to do here. 'Our team has many of the world's leading experts in aerospace and communications technology, including from Nasa's Jet Propulsion Lab and Ames Research Center.' The Zephyr High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) that flew for 54 hours. Facebook today revealed it has hired key staff from the project. Power: Titan Aerospace's drone is covered in around 3,000 solar panels producing about 7 kW of electricity - it flies above the clouds, so it is exposed to sunlight constantly during daylight hours. Wingspan and payload: 60 metres wide. The Solara 60 carries a payload of 250 pounds. Speed: Cruising speed for the Solara is about 65 mph. Function: The drone can be used for surveillance, crop-monitoring, weather and disaster oversight - or to provide communication, which is what Facebook is said to be interested in. Distance: The unmanned craft will have an operating range of over 2.8 million miles. 'Today we are also bringing on key members of the team from Ascenta, a small UK-based company whose founders created early versions of Zephyr, which became the world’s longest flying solar-powered unmanned aircraft,' he said. 'They will join our team working on connectivity aircraft.' Facebook is also  tipped to spend up to $60million on buying Texas-based Titan Aerospace, which makes drones that can fly solo for five years without needing to land, in order to bring affordable internet access to some five billion people who don’t have it. However, the technical challenges are still great. The Institution of Engineering and Technology's deputy president, Professor William Webb, said: 'The idea of using aerial platforms to deliver connectivity is one that is many decades old, from low-orbital satellites to balloons and more recently unmanned aerial vehicles.' In April, Google also acquired Titan Aerospace, which is building solar-powered drones (pictured) to provide similar connectivity . Facebook has a checkered . history with privacy, and many have voiced concerns about how the site could . use drones to collect data about people. In theory, the drones could be . used to take aerial images, or collect details about wireless networks and . individuals. As Facebook's drones will be . used to provide internet to people home's, there will need to be a limited . amount of data collection to connect the homes to the network. With this in mind, they are . likely to be subject to strict regulation. In the U.S, for example, the . Federal Aviation Authority's (FAA) guidelines state private operators  are . allowed to fly their drones ‘recreationally’ and commercial drones are . 'prohibited.' However, earlier this month . Judge Patrick Geraghty, from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) dismissed a fine, which the FAA had placed on a drone photographer. Geraghty said Raphael Pirker’s . camera drone was ‘not subject to [federal regulation] and enforcement,’ and . therefore the fine wasn’t valid.It is unsure exactly what this . ruling will mean for companies such as Amazon, and now Facebook, but it could . see the restrictions relaxed. The FAA is appealing. Facebook is also . planning to use these drones in areas outside the U.S., and it will depend on . the individual country's laws on unmanned aircraft and surveillance. 'The difficultly has always been one of keeping the aerial platform in the right place in the sky for weeks or months at a low enough cost. As technologies mature we get ever closer to achieving this and Facebook's intervention in this space is a welcome boost to the area.' He warned that there are many challenges to overcome before the dream of providing internet access to remote communities via drone can be achieved. 'Top of the list is the need to make the drones cost-effective, reliable and demonstrate to the regulators that they can operate safely in our airspace. 'Many other issues associated with access to radio spectrum, national telecoms regulations and more will also need to be addressed,' he added.","Firm developing systems to develop internet to underdeveloped countries .

"Scenes of rioting across the country today claimed their first life as a young man shot while he was sitting in a car last night died in hospital. A murder hunt was under way today after the 26-year-old was killed in the attack in Croydon, south London. He was discovered seriously injured in the vehicle at about 9.15pm as trouble flared in the south London suburb. First death: A fire rages near Reeves Corner, Croydon, several streets away from Warrington Road where the 26-year-old was shot dead . Two other people - believed to be aged in their late 20s - were arrested at the scene for handling stolen goods and taken to a south London police station. Detectives from Operation Trident have launched an investigation, a spokesman for Scotland Yard said. The shooting happened in Warrington Road as the south London suburb experienced some of the worst rioting. Earlier the man's condition had been described as 'serious'. Tonight a second man, aged in his 60s, was fighting for his life after apparently confronting rioters in Ealing. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: 'At approx 9.15pm on Monday August 8 police were called to reports of a 26-year . old man found with gun shot wounds in Warrington Road, Croydon, at the junction . with Dupass Hill Road. 'The man was inside a car when police found him.' The nearby Reeves - a well-known 144-year-old furniture store - was completely burnt down last night. Carnage: The remains of a burnt out furniture shop in Croydon, south London . Following the rioting last night David Cameron has promised 16,000 police officers will be on the streets tonight to quell the disorder. So far 525 people have been arrested in London since the riots started in Tottenham on Saturday. More than 100 people have been charged. After . cutting short his Tuscany holiday to deal with the worsening public . disorder crisis, Mr Cameron said today: 'We will do everything necessary . to restore order to Britain's streets and to make them safe for the . law-abiding. 'Let me, first . of all, completely condemn the scenes that we have seen on our . television screens and people have witnessed in their communities. 'These . are sickening scenes - scenes of people looting, vandalising, thieving, . robbing, scenes of people attacking police officers and even attacking . fire crews as they're trying to put out fires. 'This is criminality, pure . and simple, and it has to be confronted and defeated.'","Man, aged in his 60s, fighting for life after confronting rioters in Ealing ."
"Samsung has surprised audiences with the announcement of the Galaxy Note Edge - a phone with a screen that curves around the phone on one side. The technology is something that has appeared in several fan concepts for the upcoming iPhone 6, but it appears Samsung have got there first. The screen was described by Samsung's David Park as working like a 'ticker', with notifications and news scrolling along it. Scroll down for video . South Korean-based Samsung has surprisingly revealed a curved 'phablet' that beats Apple to the punch, who are apparently also planning curved devices. The Galaxy Note Edge (shown) has a curved right hand side that can display notifications like a 'ticker' The Galaxy Note Edge's unique curved touchscreen that provides quick access to frequently used apps, alerts and device functionality. Processor: 2.7 GHz Quad-Core . Display: 5.6 inches (141.9mm) Quad HD+ Suiper AMOLED (2560 x 1440) Operating System: Android 4.4 (KitKat) Rear camera: 16 Megapixel Auto Focus camera with Smart OIS . Front camera: 3.7 Megapixel . Memory: 32/64 GB internal and microSD slot (up to 64 GB) RAM: 3GB . Dimensions: 151.3 x 82.4 x 8.3 mm . Weight: 174 grams . As it pops out of the phone it can even be used when the cover is closed. The curved screen can also display notifications at the top and bottom while viewing a video without disruption. The right hand side of the Edge, which is curved, is where notifications and other icons appear. The Galaxy Note Edge was announced at the IFA trade show in Berlin on Wednesday, alongside the new Galaxy Note 4 phone, which lacks the side screen, and a virtual-reality headset called Gear VR. They are due for release in October - in time for holiday shopping - and aim to compete with Apple's new iPhones due to be unveiled next week. The Edge uses Samsung's flexible-display technology, which came out with much fanfare last year but has seen little use beyond a phone and a fitness device with displays that were slightly curved. With the Edge, Samsung is offering a practical use for the curvature. While the main screen remains flat like previous phones, the right edge extends and curves until it reaches the back. That creates a side display so information such as weather and time can be seen from the side when the phone is laid on a table or nightstand. With the side display, the phone's camera functions more like a stand-alone, point-and-shoot camera, as the shutter button and other functions appear on top when the phone is held horizontally. The Samsung Galaxy Note Edge  sports a 16MP rear-facing camera (right) and a 3.7MP front camera (left). It comes on a big day for announcements that included the Note 4 and the Gear VR headset developed in tandem with Facebook-owned virtual reality company Oculus . British  television presenter Rachel Riley showed off a virtual-reality headset called Gear VR during the Samsung event ahead of the consumer electronic fair IFA in Berlin. The headset has sensors to gauge the head's position and tells an attached Note 4 phone which part of a 360-degree image to display . The side display of the Edge also provides one-tap access to various apps normally found on the home screen. The announcement of a phone with a curved side comes less than a week before Apple is expected to announce at least one similar curved device. The unique look is seen at eventually being a key selling point for mobile and tablets, but it doesn't feature heavily in many devices yet. 'An edge-based display will give Samsung's smartphone clear differentiation in a crowded market,' said Ian Fogg, an analyst covering the mobile industry at IHS in London. 'But for Samsung to maximise the potential of an edge display it needs third party apps to support the display with additional Samsung-specific functions.' It will also have a panel of tools, like the flashlight and stopwatch, akin to what Apple offers in the iPhone's Control Center with a swipe up from the bottom. Samsung will look to app developers to find new ways to use the feature. Samsung didn't announce prices, though. In the US, last year's Galaxy Note 3 went for about £425 ($700) without a contract, or £180 ($300) with one. Prices are likely to be similar when the Note 4 comes out in October. The Edge, however, will likely cost more. Analysts said the new display feature could cut both ways. 'An edge-based display will give Samsung's smartphone clear differentiation in a crowded market,' said Ian Fogg, an analyst covering the mobile industry at IHS in London. 'But for Samsung to maximise the potential of an edge display it needs third party apps to support the display with additional Samsung-specific functions.' A visitor holds a new Samsung Galaxy Note 4 smartphone after its presentation at the Unpacked 2014 Episode 2 event today ahead of the IFA Electronics show in Berlin . Another new announcement recently from Samsung was the Gear S smart watch, seen here at a media launch event today in New York City. The Gear S is the fourth smart watch Samsung has released in a year . It was a day of several big announcements for Samsung at IFA 2014 in Berlin, as the much-rumoured Galaxy Note 4 was also unveiled. The latest version of the large smartphone has an improved interface, including a new Multiwindow feature that enables users to minimise and resize different screens on their phone for multi-tasking in much the same way you would on a desktop computer. The device will go on sale next month. Initial reaction within the industry suggests Samsung has responded well to profit drops earlier in the year, with operating profit dropping by 25 per cent in the company's second quarter results. Rob Kerr, mobiles expert at uSwitch.com, said: 'When it comes to Samsung, bigger is usually better, and its fourth generation phablet is no exception. 'Size-wise, the Note 4 is no bigger than the Note 3, but it's still bigger than most pockets.' The Samsung Galaxy Note Edge, shown, features a rounded 5.6-inch screen. 'An edge-based display will give Samsung's smartphone clear differentiation in a crowded market,' said analyst Ian Fogg .","South Korean-based Samsung has surprisingly revealed a curved 'phablet'

"The mayor of two Romanian villages has claimed that up to half of their residents will move to the UK when restrictions are lifted in January. Koller Gabriel-Adrian said he believed ‘50 per cent’ of the 1,100 people in poverty-stricken Berini and Uliuc could travel to Britain in search of higher salaries – and the generous welfare system – in the New Year. Many have already moved to France, Italy and Spain, but the mayor said the UK would soon become a more attractive destination, with ‘better conditions’, when the borders are relaxed. Mass exodus: Remus Neda, far right, his son Simon, third left, who needs drugs for a heart condition and other family members from Berini, Romania . Among those keen to move are 170 Roma who live in abject poverty on the outskirts of the villages, with no running water in their homes and as many as 20 people sharing a three-room house. One of them, father-of-seven Remus Neda, 37, said he hoped to move to Britain after learning that he could be eligible for housing benefits and NHS care. Pointing to a shaggy brown and white goat, tethered to an outhouse, he said: ‘In January, the only thing left in the village will be the goat.’ Basic conditions: Daniel Neda, left, and family outside their home . Mr Gabriel-Adrian, the mayor of Sacosu Turcesc, which encompasses these villages, said: ‘I think it is possible that half of the people in Berini and Uliuc, the Romanian and Roma people, will go to the UK next year. ‘In particular, the young people will go, because they don’t have anything here. They will go to work in agriculture and construction, but also for the benefits. ‘My advice to Britain would be not to give people everything. You should take care because, if everybody goes to the UK, what will you do? Can you afford it? ‘People do not have big salaries here and will obviously be interested in the salaries and the benefits in England.’ Reflecting growing tensions in Romania, he singled out the Roma community as the most likely to move, saying: ‘It is not a bad thing for us that they want to go somewhere else in Europe. Grinding poverty: A girl with a muddy face hides behind a woman in the village where many families live in clay huts . ‘They will go to the UK, get the benefits and maybe come back home with the money, because it is worth more here.’ The Roma in Berini live in a cluster of clay huts and survive on cabbages, potatoes and corn, which they grow themselves, as well as meagre state benefits. From January 1, all 29million people living in Romania and Bulgaria will be given the same rights as other EU citizens to live and work in the UK. Restrictions on access to benefits and NHS care – imposed when they joined the EU in 2007 – are being lifted. Staying behind: Remus Neda's goat will be left behind in the move . Romanian TV news station Digi24 has suggested that Roma in Uliuc and Berini, near the Hungarian border, are ‘just waiting to make the journey to the UK’. Some of them have already been ‘voluntarily expelled’ from France – and given free flights home – in a clampdown on illegal camps. More than 10,000 Roma from Romania and Bulgaria are repatriated from France every year. Remus Neda is one of the wealthiest Roma living in Berini because, he said, he makes ‘good money’ begging on the streets of Paris for four months of every year. Abject poverty: As many as 20 people share a three-bedroom house in Berini . Desperate: Maria Neda, 47, and her one-year-old son Simon are supported by Remus, who says he makes 'good money' from begging on the streets of Paris for four months every year . Destitute: Children play together in the poverty-stricken village of Berini where some properties do not have running water . His family including several grandchildren live in a ramshackle brick house, rather than a clay hut, but they are still very poor and hope to relocate to London soon. Speaking through a translator, Mr Neda said: ‘We have heard on the television that the rules are changing. It will be a very good opportunity for us. ‘If we can get a house for all the 12 people in my family then it will be a much better way of living. ‘My brother-in-law is already working in London in construction. We will wait for a call from him to say it is true that we can get benefits and then we will go the next day. I will get a job in construction on the black market, or as an employee.’ But it is the world-renowned NHS, and not just the housing benefits, that he seeks in Britain. New pastures: Families see the move to London as a 'good opportunity' for them . Handouts: The families in the village only receive £9 a month from the Romanian authorities for each of their children, which they say is not enough to raise them . His 15-month-old son Simon still bears the scars of heart surgery and Mr Neda must pay for his on-going medication in Romania. ‘In the UK, it would be better because we would have free medical care,’ he said. Another Roma villager, Daniela Neda, 45, who is not related to Remus, also plans to move to the UK when the restrictions are lifted. Until last summer, she was living illegally in a caravan in Paris, and made €15 a day from begging, but the French authorities paid for her flight home. Access to welfare: Remus Neda, left, said he hoped to move to Britain soon after learning he could be eligible for housing benefits and NHS care . Future: Young people are more likely to travel to Britain because there is nothing else for them in Romania . Miss Neda, who lives in a tiny clay home with her five-year-old daughter Ionela and 18 relatives, said: ‘We have heard it will soon be easier for us to go abroad and get the benefits from countries like UK. ‘We only receive 40 leu (£9) per child every month here. It is not enough to raise a child.’ Rudko Kawczynski, president of the European Roma Travellers’ Forum, dismissed concerns that Romanians and Bulgarians will claim benefits when the borders rules are relaxed. Speaking on a video on the Council of Europe website, he said: ‘Nobody can come to a country, like France or Germany, and say, “Here I am. Please, I want social welfare.” It’s stupid, it’s nonsense.’","Remus Neda, 37, is heading for the UK to take advantage of state handouts .

"Former President George Bush was given a series of direct warnings throughout 2001 about the possibility of a terrorist attack by Al Qaeda - but failed to take them seriously, it was claimed today. On the eleventh anniversary of the atrocity, it has been reported that the White House received multiple briefs  between May and August that year about an attack with explosives and numerous casualties. But the president continually failed to take any significant action and questioned the thoroughness of the briefings - leading to huge frustrations within the CIA. The retrospective report was lambasted as 'unfair' and a 'disservice to history' by George Pataki, the New York state governor during 9/11 who praised Bush's leadership in the months after the attacks. Scroll down for video . Worrying: Former U.S. President George Bush was given a series of direct warnings throughout 2001 about the possibility of a terrorist attack on the U.S. by Al Qaeda - but failed to take them seriously, it has emerged . Anger: Bush continually failed to take any significant action . against briefings warning of Al Qaeda, the report suggests. People are pictured walking away from the World Trade . Center following the attacks . But it shows the repeated warnings came before . the famous top secret briefing - which has previously been reported - . given to Bush on August 6 with the heading 'Bin Laden Determined to Strike in the U.S'. Just a few weeks later on September 11, terrorists smashed planes into the World Trade Center in New York City - killing nearly 3,000 people and horrifying the world. Details of the other briefings given to Mr Bush and his administration - which have never been made public - have now been revealed by The New York Times. And they paint a startling picture of negligence at the heart of the U.S. government before 9/11. The White House was made aware of potential attacks in the spring and, by May 1, was told by the CIA that 'a group . presently in the United States' was planning a terrorist attack, the Times reported. Concerns: Revelations about the briefings paint a worrying picture of negligence at the heart of the U.S. government leading up to 9/11 which left almost 3,000 people dead . Horrific: This famous photo taken on September 11, . 2001 shows President Bush's Chief of Staff Andy Card whispering into his ear to tell him of a plane crashing into the World . Trade Center . May 1, 2001 CIA told White House that 'a group presently in the United States' was planning a terrorist operation 'with explosives' June 22, 2001 CIA brief reported that Al Qaeda attacks could be 'imminent' June 29, 2001 Warning that the government needed to take briefs seriously. Added evidence included Bin Laden aides warning of an attack and operatives claiming it would have 'dramatic consequences' July 1, 2001 Brief said the operation had been delayed but 'will occur soon' July 9, 2001 Extremist in Chechnya linked to Al Qaeda told followers there would soon be big news - and within 48 hours the information was passed to the White House . July 24, 2001 Bush told the attack was still under preparation but that it had been postponed . August 6, 2001 Bush received review of threats posed by Al Qaeda with headline: 'Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S.' In another daily brief on June 22, the administration was told that Al Qaeda  strikes could be 'imminent'. However, the new neoconservative leaders at the Pentagon told the White House that the CIA had been fooled. They believed that Bin Laden was pretending to plan an attack to distract the U.S. from Iraqi leader  Saddam Hussein. Following this, the CIA prepared another daily brief for June 29 in which they listed over a page the evidence which they had built up. This included an interview with a journalist from the Middle East in which aides of Bin Laden warned of an upcoming attack. The briefing also included: 'The U.S. is not the target of a disinformation campaign by Usama Bin Laden.' It . also included details from people close to Bin Laden which claimed the . expected attacks would have dramatic consequences with many casualties. Another warning on July 1 said despite the attack being delayed it would soon take place. But despite these warnings the White House did not appear to take them as seriously as the CIA was demanding. The Times reports that . officials within the CIA's Counterterrorism Center became increasingly . angry and in one meeting an official suggested the staff request a . transfer so they could not be blamed when the attack occurred. The . White House was also told that the extremist Ibn Al-Khattab - known for . his links to Al Qaeda - told his followers in Chechnya that there would . ' be big news soon', the Times reported. Wrong: Neoconservative leaders at the Pentagon told the White House the CIA had been fooled. They . believed Bin Laden was pretending to plan an attack to distract the U.S. from Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein . Bush was told on July 24 that the attack was still being prepared but added that it had been postponed by a few months. However, he did not think the briefings were adequate and requested a much more detailed analysis of Al Qaeda. This was to be the famous briefing of . August 6 which was eventually declassified by the White House in April . 2004 and made public. 'The administration's reaction to . what Mr. Bush was told in the weeks before that infamous briefing . reflected significantly more negligence than has been disclosed,' Kurt Eichenwald wrote in the piece for the New York Times. 'In other words, the Aug. 6 document, . for all of the controversy it provoked, is not nearly as shocking as . the briefs that came before it.' Following the devastating attacks on . 9/11, the White House - which was receiving criticism it had ignored CIA . warnings - said it had never been told when or where the attacks would . take place. Yet many . have claimed that if the government had been on high security alert over . that summer they may have found out about the planned attack - and . saved the lives of thousands. Never forget: The Tribute in Light is illuminated next to the Statue of . Liberty and One World Trade Center, left, during events marking . the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center . Stunning: The Tribute in Light is an art installation near the site of the World Trade Center in remembrance of the September 11 attacks . Yet George Pataki, New York state governor on 9/11, laid into Eichenwald during a joint appearance on MSNBC for writing the New York Times article about the briefings. 'I just think this is incredibly unfortunate, to be perfectly honest. Because first of all, having been there, on September 11th and for weeks, months thereafter President Bush provided inspired, effective leadership,' Pataki, a Republican, said. 'On September 11th everything changed and to look 11 years later and say, ""Aha, this was happening before September 11th in the summer"" and go though and selectively say, ""You should've done that, you should've done that"" I think is incredibly unfair and a disservice to history. 'And by the way if you look back there are those who could have said that President Roosevelt was at fault for Pearl Harbor. But the government didn't look back and say, ""let's blame the President""; we came together to fight an important war.'","White House given series of briefings about an Al Qaeda attack between May and August 2001 - but failed to take any significant action .

"No strings attached: Kyle Gordy offers his services to women online as a free sperm donor and has sex with women so they can become pregnant instead of using a sperm bank . 'Joe' is married, has three teenage children, is a successful internet entrepreneur and when he can, jets off around the country to have sex with women in secret as a 'free sperm donor'. Though he is unwilling to reveal his true identity for fear of his wife finding out, Joe describes his home life as 'Clark Kent' and revels in his 'Superman' style alter-ego, offering his services to women through 'natural insemination'. Estimating that he has fathered more than 30 children through his seven-year 'career', Joe is part of a small but growing trend online for women to cut through the red-tape and cost of traditional sperm banks to become pregnant. Offering their services on the Internet for free, donors are contacted by women who want to become mothers 'the natural way', believing that having sexual intercourse is the most efficient method to conceive. After meeting online and going through a vetting process, Joe will arrange either to ship his sperm for a more traditional artificial insemination, or will arrange to fly to see the women and donate 'directly' through sex. Talking to ABC News' 20/20, Joe said he has slept with more than 100 women as a free sperm donor, but claims he is discerning. 'I'm not having intercourse with these women when there's no chance of pregnancy,' said Joe to ABC News, without explaining exactly how he would know that. Confirming that his wife and children are clueless about his double life, Joe says that he is fulfilling his own dreams through natural insemination. 'I have a Clark Kent life. Then, I have the Superman life,' Joe said to ABC News. 'People might want to have millions of dollars in the bank, and then, you know, some of us might want to have dozens of children out there. Facebook: On his social media page Kyle advertises himself as a sperm donor and to date he has already fathered one child as a 'free donor' As well as helping a woman to have the child she wants, Joe gets to add his progeny to the world. 'I'm unable to have as many children as I want in my relationship, and that would be unreasonable to ask a woman to give birth to 30 children,' said Joe to ABC News. Asked when he will stop, or what his goal is through natural insemination, Joe seemed to aim high. 'The World Health Organization said I can get up to 2,500, but I don't think that will happen in my lifetime. The other donors I know who have a lot [of children] are up there around the 100 range. I'm standing on the shoulders of giants,' said Joe to ABC News. 'I have the satisfaction of knowing that I have another descendant out there,' Joe said. 'It's not the road. It's how we get there, if we actually get there.' Another free sperm donor who did wish to be identified was 23-year-old Kyle Gordy. History: On his profile, Kyle shows prospective mothers what he looked like as a child, outlines his education level, IQ and the occupations of his brothers and father . He is currently working towards his master's degree in accounting and like Joe, offers women the chance to get pregnant by having sex with him. 'I don't do any drugs. I don't smoke. I don't drink. I don't drink caffeine. I eat only sperm-friendly food: wheat, brown rice ... fruit and vegetables,' said Gordy to 20/20. During the course of his interview, Kyle was very complimentary about his family tree and genes. 'Right now I'm attending university. Both siblings are engineers. The nuclear engineer is my twin. My grandpa was a scientist,' said Gordy. On his Facebook page which advertises him as a sperm donor, Gordy has posted pictures of himself now and as a child along with his IQ. Gordy told ABC News that he is not just looking to have sex with women, but to genuinely help them to have a child. 'I'm passing on my legacy and giving these people kids,' said Gordy. To date, Gordy has fathered one child and another one of his recipients, 44-year-old Serena, drove two hours to his home to be naturally inseminated. Traditional: A small but growing band of women are eschewing traditional sperm banks to use men who offer their services online . Serena, whose identity has been concealed by 20/20 said that she has longed for a child. 'Always, since I was a very young child, and sometimes career and life just gets in the way,' the insurance broker told 20/20. 'Then oops, I'm 38. Oops, I'm 40.' Another important facet of free sperm donors is simply that, no cost. Serena said that she was unable to afford sperm bank fees. Some charge upwards of $1,000 for one vial. She said that after searching the Internet for alternatives, she settled on free sperm donors and natural insemination. 'I felt that there's maybe no other alternative for me. My clock is obviously ticking loud and louder every day,' she said to 20/20.","As sperm bank prices soar - women turning directly to online 'free sperm donors'

"South Korea's growing obsession with plastic surgery became apparent when pictures of a group of aspiring beauty queens posted online prompted claims that cosmetic procedures have left all the contestants looking the same. Pictures of the 20 Miss Korea 2013 finalists were posted on Reddit fuelling speculation that many of them had undergone surgery and prompting users to criticise the Asian nation's growing trend to go under the knife. South Koreans currently have more plastic surgery than in any other country according to recent figures, with the craze particularly popular among 19 to 49-year-olds. Beauty queen hopefuls: A picture of the Miss Korea 2013 hopefuls went viral after a Reddit user posted it online claiming that plastic surgery had left all the finalists with the same look . Beautiful: The Reddit post spoke fierce debate on Reddit with more than 3,000 users choosing to comment . The popularity of surgery, particularly among the young, has been blamed by some on a desire to look more 'western' fuelled by an obsession with celebrity culture. All of the women vying for the crown of Miss Korea 2013 have dark, perfectly trussed hair, either tumbling over their shoulders or neatly tied up, pale skin, bright eyes and a perfect bright white smile. And their apparent similarity prompted Reddit user ShenTheWise to post their pictures online, suggesting that many of those vying for the Miss Korea title this year have had similar surgery. He captioned the image: 'Korea’s plastic surgery mayhem is finally converging on the same face.' The post saw more than 3,000 people comment in response, debating the merits of widespread plastic surgery. Reddit user HotBrownie, who claims to hail from Seoul, said: :  'Those women in fact do look unnervingly similar and yes, Koreans think so too. 'This is called the Korean plastic face look. In certain areas of Seoul, you would think all the women are sisters because they look so similar due to same surgeries. 'Without the plastic surgery, korean women are very diverse looking and easily can be told apart. Finalists: All of the finalists have similar coloured hair and bright smiles . Debate: Many questioned the wisdom of plastic surgery and blamed an obsession with celebrity culture for an upsurge in procedures in the country . 'The surgery takes away their individuality and uniqueness and its sad. Most are beautiful without it but telling them that their Korean ethnic features are in fact lovely is as effective as screaming at a brick wall. 'They wont believe you because they've been brainwashed to think westernization of their features is superior, I don't think they want to look white, but a mix of white and Asian and definitely less Korean.' Another Reddit user, Forevertraveling, added: 'I live in Korea and older women complain how girls don't look Korean anymore because of all the plastic surgery. 'It's so common to the point if I meet a girl, I just assume she has had something done. Stunning: Two of the Miss Korea 2013 hopefuls are pictured . Beautiful: A montage of all of the contestants for Miss Korea 2013 was posted on Reddit . 'Girls here consider eye surgery just like using make up. ' But others on the social networking site said that all the pictures served to prove was that there is a 'cultural divide' between the east and west in terms of plastic surgery. HerpDerpDrone commented: 'Western women want to exaggerate their features with plastic surgeries (fuller lips, bigger boobs, bigger butts) while Asian women want to refine their features (smaller chins etc) so there is definitely a cultural divide when it comes to plastic surgery.' Miss South Korea Yu-Mi Kim admitted having cosmetic surgery saying: 'I never said I was born beautiful' The pageant sparked controversy last year when pictures emerged of winner Kim Yu-Mi before she had undergone plastic surgery, with many claiming that cosmetic procedures give contestants an unfair advantage. The student revealed her plastic surgery secret after photos emerged of her looking very different at school, but she said she hadn't misled anyone. But she defended her crown telling the Korean media: 'I never said I was born beautiful.' South Koreans have more plastic surgery than any other nation according to figures released in January. Those in the Asian country have more treatments per members of the population, with one in every 77 turning to the knife or needle. The figures, from the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (ISAPS), show that in 2011, 15 million people across the globe turned to plastic surgery to enhance their looks. While the popularity of cosmetic surgery in South Korea may come as a surprise to many, the industry there is in fact booming. Last year, 20 per cent of women aged 19 to 49 in the capital city of Seoul admitted to going under the knife. One of the most popular surgical procedures is double eyelid surgery - which reduces excess skin in the upper eyelid to make the eyes appear bigger and make them look more 'Western'. It is believed that the rise of the country's music industry is behind the boom, and many patients visit clinics with photos of celebrities, asking surgeons to emulate American noses or eyes. Singer PSY, whose song 'Gangnam Style' became a global hit, said his record label had urged him to get plastic surgery.

"Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has warned his side they cannot afford to lose focus and take the threat of goal-shy Aston Villa lightly on Sunday. The Gunners signalled a return to form with a battling 2-0 win at Manchester City before then securing safe passage past Brighton into the fifth round of the FA Cup. With the likes of Theo Walcott and Mesut Ozil now back in contention, each having scored in the 3-2 win over the Seagulls, the mood within the squad is very much positive as they prepare for the defining period of the campaign. Mesut Ozil scored in Arsenal's last game against Aston Villa, a 3-0 win in September . Tomas Rosicky shone in Arsenal's 3-2 win against Brighton and will look repeat his display on Sunday . Aaron Ramsey inspired Arsenal to an important three points over Manchester City two weeks ago . Arsenal could climb back into the top four of the Barclays Premier League with what would be a fifth straight win in all competitions, and Wenger does not want concentration levels to drift. 'We want complete focus and commitment to be completely concentrated on what we want to achieve,' said the Arsenal boss, who could be without Chile forward Alexis Sanchez because of a hamstring problem. 'We have to be very cautious with the mood in our job because the swings are very quick. 'You need a good balance between an optimistic mood and urgency as well. 'We are in a job where, of course, you want the level of concentration very high and that is what we want to achieve now. 'We go into a period in the next four months that will decide our season, so we have to be conscious that our commitment has to be 100 per cent.' Wenger, however, insists there can be no sense of complacency at the Emirates Stadium against a Villa side who are the lowest scorers in the Premier League with just 11 from 22 matches as Paul Lambert's men struggle to move up the table. 'There is a distortion between the quality Villa have going forward [and their goal record],' the Gunners boss said.

"A 49-year-old underwear model has accused the fashion industry of ageism as she says she can no longer get any work because she looks too young. Carolyn Brennan, from Leicester, has been modelling lingerie and bikinis for more than 20 years but in the last 12 months her work has dried up. She said she has been repeatedly told she's 'not suitable' for jobs because she looks younger than her years. Out of work: Carolyn Brennan, 49, said looks too young to get jobs modelling clothes for women her age . Not compromising: She said she's not prepared to wear dowdy clothes just  because she's expected to as she's nearing 50 . Carolyn said: 'I'm trapped in a no-go zone for women because I am neither young enough or old enough to model' Single success: Carolyn believes she's remained looking young because she doesn't have a man . The model said she could gain work if she looked older but she's 'not prepared to fit the stereotype' by wearing 'dowdy' clothes just because she's nearly 50. She said: 'I find it quite shocking that the . fashion industry seems to have forgotten a huge swathe of women who are . middle-aged but not ready to wear cardigans just yet. Why should I wear shapeless dowdy clothes just because I’m nearly 50?' 'Just because a woman is in her late 40s . doesn't mean she can't be sexy or wear underwear. Not everyone has the . figure I have but an awful lot of women do' In the early 90s, Carolyn modelled for Harley Davidson, was a catwalk model at dozens of NEC trade shows for Peugeot and worked for Aspire magazine. But she can no longer gain jobs posing in clothes aimed at her age group because she looks too young. And in a cruel twist, she is also unable to get work for the younger fashion . market because she is considered too old. Once in demand: In her youth, Carolyn modelled for Harley Davidson and Aspire magazine . Ageism: Carolyn said she can no longer get jobs like this because women her age aren't deemed to wear such sexy underwear .

She added: 'I . have always modelled in some capacity at trade shows, magazines and for . big names like Harley Davidson and Aspire magazine and have always . looked after myself. 'When I . decided to go freelance I started approaching agencies for work but I . was told on more than one occasion I would struggle to find work because . I looked too young. 'One . agency told me I looked in my 20s. The irony is that I won't even be . considered for younger modelling projects because of my age.' Perfect pins: She's always been told she has 'good legs' so she can't understand why they can no longer get her work .

Not fitting the stereotype: Carolyn said: 'Women of my age with my figure are frowned on by society because for some reason we are expected to be married and our bodies gone south' Predicament: Employment wasn't a problem in her late 30s but now she's struck between looking too young - but not young enough .

'After approaching so many modelling agencies I know that I would get more work if I looked older but I’m not prepared to fit the stereotype.' Carolyn believes her youthful looks are down to the fact she keeps fit and has remained single. She said: 'I exercise a lot with stretches and running but I also think one of the reasons I stay young is a lack of a man.

"Polish parents who claim child benefit for their families in their home country should not receive the same amount as British workers, Nick Clegg said today. The Deputy Prime Minister has ordered officials to find a legal way to slash the ‘absurd’ payments made for children who do not live in the UK. He said it was not fair that Britain pays £80-a-month per child, but in Poland child benefit is worth only £18. Nick Clegg wants Britain to stop paying UK rates for child benefit for children who live in countries where the rates are lower . Under EU rules, the benefit has to be paid to European nationals who are working in Britain and paying National Insurance – even if their families are based abroad. There are around 24,000 families claiming for 38,500 children, with two-thirds of the children based in Poland. David Cameron has said the payments are 'wrong' and vowed to scrap them altogether under wider EU reforms, which he admits will ‘take time’. However, Mr Clegg believes Britain could act unilaterally now and cut the amount which is paid to match the child benefit rates in the countries where the children live. Speaking on his LBC radio phone-in, Mr Clegg said: ‘There’s this thing about us paying child benefit to people who are working here but have got children elsewhere. ‘Obviously that’s absurd. I would like to deal with that overnight, but you have to wait for the treaties to change. But in the meantime here’s an idea that might be worth exploring…. If there’s a Polish couple here or a Polish parent here and they are receiving child benefit, I think they should receive child benefit at the £18 per month which is the child benefit rate in Poland, not the £80 rate that we pay them here in the UK. ‘After all the child is in Poland. It saves a bit of money, but also symbolically it’s important.’ Two thirds of all child benefit sent abroad goes to pay for children in Poland, according to officials figures . Mr Clegg conceded that there will be ‘all sorts of legalities which might be difficult to straighten out’. But he insisted: ‘It’s a fairer way of doing it. It’s one of the things that we should do… I am getting people to look at it and as ever you get reams and reams of paper saying it’s difficult. ‘Don’t worry I thump desks all the time and stamp feet, and I do so all the time. ‘Freedom to move was never, should never have been and mustn’t be freedom to claim. And that’s the big distinction we need to make.’ Child benefit in the UK is paid at £20.30 a week for the first child and £13.40 for every other child. Since last year families in the UK with one person earning more than £50,000 have had their child benefit cut, and removed altogether if one earner has a salary of more than £60,000. Child benefit in some countries is more generous than the UK, worth around £115 per month in Belgium, £160 in Denmark and £155 in Germany.","Deputy Prime Minister orders officials to find a way to cut costs .

"British actor Idris Elba has revealed that he was inspired by his own father when playing Nelson Mandela in the film based on the life of the great South African leader. The star helped lead to the tributes to Mandela last night following news that the anti-apartheid icon had died at the age of 95. The new biopic, named after Mandela's autobiography Long Walk to Freedom, had special poignancy for Mr Elba because it was the last performance of his which his father Winston saw before he died two months ago. Family: Actor Idris Elba has revealed he based his portrayal of Nelson Mandela on his father Winston, left . Star: Mr Elba plays Mandela in Long Walk to Freedom, a film based on the statesman's autobiography . Emotion: Mr Elba could be seen apparently shedding a tear on the red carpet at the British premiere of Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom on Thursday night . In an interview with The Sun, the 41-year-old actor said that he had based his portrayal of Mandela on Winston, adding that when he was made up as the president in old age he looked strikingly similar to his own father. 'Ironically I looked just like my old man,' he said. 'I designed my Mandela on my dad.' Mr Elba has previously said that in order to speak like the former president of South Africa, he imitated the speech patterns of Winston, who was brought up in Sierra Leone and moved to Britain shortly before Idris' birth. 'There are certain ways that African men speak English, and Mandela and my dad sort of fall into a similar category,' he said last month. 'They are very grammar-conscious and like to use long words.' Portrayal: Mr Elba is apparently so convincing that Mandela though he was watching news footage of himself . Voice: The actor said he managed to capture Mandela's speech by thinking of his father's African accent . Winston died of lung cancer aged 76 eight weeks ago, but he was able to watch the film shortly before his death, in what was apparently an 'emotional' experience for the family. 'He must have thought it was one of the last times he was going to see one of my really big performances,' Mr Elba told The Sun. 'It's a sad film and now, when I think about it, it must have been emotional for him. He must have known.' Mandela died very shortly before the British premiere of the film about his life, and Mr Elba was apparently in tears when producer Anant Singh announced the news to the shocked audience at the end of the showing. The actor then took to the stage alongside producer Harvey Weinstein in order to lead a moment's silence in memory of the leader. Co-stars: Mr Elba at the film's British premiere last night alongside Naomie Harris, who plays Winnie Mandela . Premiere: Mr Elba, Ms Harris and co-star Tony Kgoroge pose with Mandela's daughters Zindzi, centre, and Zenani, second right . Mr Elba said: 'What an honour it was to step into the shoes of Nelson Mandela and portray a man who defied odds, broke down barriers, and championed human rights before the eyes of the world. 'My thoughts and prayers are with his family.' On the red carpet before the showing, the actor - who struggled with racist abuse as he was growing up in East London - spoke of the difficulties in capturing the essence of such an iconic global figure. 'For somone who doesn't look like Mandela you have got to work harder to get the audience in there,' Mr Elba said. However, he was apparently so successful in portraying the ex-president that when Mandela himself saw footage from the film, he thought he was watching himself in old news footage. Beloved: The world is in mourning after Mandela died yesterday at the age of 95 . 'He has seen clips of the film and said he saw [Idris] that he thought it was him,' Mandela's daughter Zindzi said before last night's premiere. She added: 'When my 11 year-old grandson saw the movie last week I asked him what he thought, and he said: ""The dude who played grandad, when he talks he kind of reminds me of him.""' Mr Elba was so dedicated to the role that he persuaded the custodians of Robben Island, the prison where Mandela spent 18 years which is now a museum, to let him spend a night in a cell. The experience helped him get inside the mind of the South African legend, and made him more convinced than ever that he had to do justice to Mandela's heroism. 'I wanted to do this because I believe in what his message was - that we can all live together,' Mr Elba told The Sun. The film, Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom, will be released in the UK on January 3.","British actor says his father Winston inspired him in portrayal of Mandela .

"Some of the greatest figures in Britain’s past are to be restored to their rightful place in history, thanks to an overhaul of the school curriculum. The likes of Oliver Cromwell, Lord Nelson and Winston Churchill had been dropped from history lessons under the last Labour Government in a move critics said was driven by ‘political correctness’. But under a new ‘back-to-basics’ shake-up, pupils will again have  to study these traditional historic  figures – and not social reformers such as Jamaican-born nurse Mary Seacole and former black slave Olaudah Equiano, who were introduced into the 2007 curriculum. The revisions, spearheaded by Tory Education Secretary Michael Gove, are certain to anger equality activists who believe history lessons are too skewed towards white British men. But they have been welcomed by . traditionalists such as Conservative MP Philip Davies, who said: ‘The . curriculum has to specify figures like Nelson and Wellington. ‘Far too often we are apologising for things in our past, but actually we have so much in our history to be proud of. It is essential that children learn why they should be proud of their country.’ And former Government history adviser Anthony Freeman said teachers needed guidelines to teach about the key figures who shaped our past, saying: ‘Many teachers are more concerned to promote politically correct social themes than to present a narrative.’ Leaked drafts of the new history curriculum, to be published in the New Year, show that schools will be required to cover the Norman Conquest, Henry II and his conflict with the Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Becket, and King John and his power struggles with the Barons that resulted in the Magna Carta. Episodes such as the Black Death, the Wars of the Roses, the growth of the British Empire and the trial and execution of Charles I will also be included, as will the Acts of Union – which will become the subject of scrutiny as Scotland holds a referendum on independence in 2014. But out go figures including social reformers Robert Owen and  Elizabeth Fry, aviator Amy Johnson, nurse Florence Nightingale, and Equiano and his fellow anti-slavery campaigner William Wilberforce. Reform: Education Secretary Michael Gove has spearheaded the 'back-to-basics; curriculum reform. Last year, Mr Gove said that too many children were leaving school ignorant about Britain's past because syllabuses had been stripped of core content . However, pupils will still have to learn about social changes such as the abolition of slavery and the suffragettes. In addition, references to cultural, ethnic and religious diversity have been cut, although they will still be taught about immigration. The changes have been drawn up amid great secrecy by Government advisers, including television historian Simon Schama. Mr Gove said a year ago that too many children were leaving school ignorant about Britain’s past because syllabuses had been stripped of core content. He pointed to a survey which found a sixth of 18- to 24-year-olds believed Cromwell, rather than Nelson, led the British fleet at Trafalgar. Mr Gove said: ‘I am genuinely worried that – despite the best efforts of brilliant history teachers, gifted academics and the television and publishing executives who’ve helped to popularise history – our curriculum and examinations system mean that children thirsting to know more about our past leave school woefully undernourished.’ Mr Gove has also criticised the existing curriculum for focusing on certain periods such as the Tudors and the world wars while missing out large chunks of the past. The national curriculum sets out the minimum that should be taught in schools, but it does not prevent teachers adding any material they wish to flesh out lessons – including events and individuals that have been cut out of the new version. However, they will have to ensure they first cover all the areas specified in the new curriculum. The national curriculum is compulsory only in maintained state schools; academies and free schools can create their own versions. The Department for Education said: ‘We do not comment on leaks.’","Historic figures, including Winston Churchill, Oliver Cromwell and Lord Nelson will again feature in history lessons .

"Walter Crompton, 83, from Blackley, Manchester, has been arrested and banned from seeing his wife after he gave her a pain patch in Allendale care home. Police have arrested a grandfather of 83 on suspicion of poisoning his frail wife after he gave her a pain-killing patch to alleviate her aches and pains . Walter Crompton attached the prescription patch to the leg of wife of 60 years Eileen after she said she had been left in severe discomfort by a blood clot. But staff at Allendale Care Home in Blackley, Manchester where 83-year old dementia suffer Mrs Crompton has been residing for the past two weeks, contacted police because the patch contains morphine.

The pensioner, from Blackley, is due to answer his bail at the end of the month when it is thought he will be told whether he is to be charged. The maximum sentence for a conviction on administering poison or noxious thing with intent to injure, aggrieve or annoy is five years in jail. Wedding bliss, as Walter Crompton, 83, and his wife Eileen cut the cake at their wedding in 1953. He has been arrested and banned from seeing his wife after he gave her a pain patch in Allendale care home in Blackley, Manchester . Walter Crompton, 83, has been arrested and banned from seeing his wife. The pair are pictured here on their wedding day in 1953 . Walter Crompton, arrested and banned from seeing his wife after he gave her a pain patch, looks through a family photo album at his home in Blackley, Manchester . But Mr Crompton said the patches had been prescribed by a doctor and said care home staff did not tell him the pain relief patches were banned - just that his wife’s codeine prescription was not allowed on the premises. He added: 'It’s a patch, nobody ever killed anybody with a patch. 'I don’t understand why they needed to arrest me. I was just trying to help my wife and I didn’t know it was against the rules. 'We’ve spent 60 years of our life together. She mustn’t know what’s going on. She is a dear lady, and a quiet character. She never wants any trouble.' Allendale Care Home in Blackley, Manchester where Walter Crompton's wife 83-year-old wife Eileen had been staying. Staff there alerted police after finding that the prescription patch Mr Crompton had attached to his ill wife's leg contained morphine . Retired factory machinist Mrs Crompton moved into the care home two weeks ago after a number of falls at home. She has dementia, heart problems and chronic arthritis, for which her doctor had prescribed codeine. Walter has been his wife’s only carer for two years when she became seriously ill. He supplied the patches after she developed a blood clot in her leg that was causing her a lot of pain. The couple’s daughter Caron Hampson, 50, said: 'I think it’s awful. He’s an 83-year-old man and they treated him like a thug. 'He was concerned about her leg which they didn’t treat right away, and I can imagine he got quite angry about it, but there is no way they needed to call the police. He’s not physically intimidating or violent.' Walter Crompton, pictured left next to wife wife Eileen, son in law Stephen Hampson and daughter Caron. Police have arrested Mr Crompton, 83, on suspicion of poisoning his infirm wife after he gave her a painkilling patch to alleviate her aches and pains. Greater Manchester Police said: 'On Tuesday, 2 April 2014, police in North Manchester received of report of concern over medicine administered to a resident at a Blackley care home. 'Officers from the Public Protection Investigation Unit started an investigation and a multi-agency strategy meeting was held with partner agencies to discuss how to best to establish the facts. 'Subsequently an 83-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of administering a noxious substance. 'He has been released on bail pending further inquiries until 28 April 2014. 'Officers are continuing to work with partner agencies, including the care home as part of this ongoing investigation.' Happy memories: Walter Crompton and his wife Eileen arm in arm on their wedding day in 1953. But more than 60 years later Mr Crompton, 83, has been arrested and banned from seeing his wife after he gave her a pain patch in Allendale  care home, in Blackley, Manchester . Walter Crompton, wearing a suit and tie, and his wife Eileen, wearing a light summery outfit, are pictured here relaxing on holiday. Walter, 83, has been arrested after he gave his wife a prescription painkilling patch containing morphine . Det Supt Joanne Rawlinson, of the Public Protection Division, said: 'This is a potentially serious offence in which a vulnerable elderly woman with significant health issues could have come to serious harm and, as such, the police will always conduct a thorough investigation. 'As part of any inquiry like this our priority is always to protect vulnerable people and this may involve certain bail conditions being imposed.' The Allendale Care Home declined to comment.

"Pupils who make malicious allegations against teachers should face criminal charges, a union said today. The NASUWT said false claims remain 'an enduring problem', blighting the lives and careers of accused teachers, and called for urgent action to make sure that those responsible face punishment. The union published figures showing that 103 of its members faced criminal allegations last year. Of these, only four resulted in court action, 39 cases are yet to be concluded and the rest (60 in total) were not taken forward. The NASUWT, at their annual conference, want malicious actions against teachers turned into a criminal offence (file picture) Teachers: . 2,827 allegations of abuse were against school teachers . 47% of allegations were unsubstantiated . 18% were suspended during investigations . 12% faced a criminal investigation .

Just . 3% of investigations resulted in a criminal . caution or conviction . NASUWT stats based on council figures . NASUWT, or the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, passed . a resolution at its annual conference in Birmingham which said it . believes 'the most effective way to protect teachers from malicious . allegations is to make such an allegation a criminal offence'. It called on the union's executive to 'take action to bring about the necessary legislative change'. Phil Dunn, a physics teacher from Walsall, told delegates: 'Malicious allegations eat away at the very fabric of our professional standards. 'The NASUWT has successfully highlighted the blight on the accused teachers' lives and their families, with often lengthy suspensions. Many teachers are simply unwilling to return to teaching following such allegations. 'Strong clear legislation would make the consequences of such allegations plain and clear to pupils and families. 'I will not defend any teacher who has betrayed the basic tenets of our profession. Child protection remains one of the basic foundations of our profession. 'But, colleagues, malicious allegations threaten to undermine that very basis.' NASUWT general secretary Chris Keates said: 'These figures demonstrate that the issue of false, malicious and unsubstantiated allegations against teachers continues to be an enduring problem. Chris Keates, acting general secretary of the NASUWT: 'An enduring problem' 'Teachers' fear of having allegations made against them is very real, yet four out of five did not feel that current protections for teachers are adequate. 'The coalition Government has made bold promises of handing power back to teachers, but the new powers to search and restrain pupils, which teachers did not want, will leave them even more vulnerable to allegations and litigation. 'The fear of having an allegation made against them is compounded by the fact that, even if they are exonerated, their career will be permanently blighted by the fact that the allegation will remain on record. 'Urgent action is needed to bring in statutory provisions to cover the recording and reporting of allegations on a teacher's file.' According to research commissioned by the Department for Education, nearly half of allegations made against teachers are malicious, unsubstantiated or unfounded. Hands up for legislation: The union supported measures to stop teachers being 'dragged through the mud' The survey, which examined the number . and nature of allegations of abuse referred to 116 English councils . between April 1 2009 and March 31 2010 found that of 12,086 allegations . referred, 2,827 (23%) were against school teachers while a further 1,709 . allegations of abuse were made against non-teaching staff in schools. Almost half (47%) of all allegations made against teachers, and two-fifths (41%) of those made against non-teaching staff members were found to be unsubstantiated, malicious or unfounded. But 18% of school teachers and 29% of non-teaching staff were suspended while accusations were investigated. And one in eight teachers (12%) and nearly a fifth of those non-teaching members of staff (19%) faced a criminal investigation. Just 3% of concluded investigations against teachers resulted in a criminal caution or conviction; for non-teaching staff this figure was 5%, the survey found. This is based on information held by councils rather than the police. A DfE spokesman said: 'Schools should have absolutely no tolerance of malicious allegations against teachers. We've made crystal clear that heads can suspend or expel pupils who make false claims - and should report them to the police if they believe a criminal offence has been committed. 'All investigations must be quick and thorough, with unfounded allegations stripped out of individual teachers' personnel records. 'We've legislated so teachers have a legal right to anonymity before they are charged with an offence, to prevent their names being dragged through the mud.'","Teachers union NASUWT: 'False claims are an enduring problem'

"The discovery of a mummified dog in Mexico could unlock secrets about the country's mysterious ancient tribal groups' hunting traditions. Anthropologist Isaac Aquino exhibited the estimated 1000-year-old canine remains at regional museum in the city of Torreon. It was found in Candelaria Cave in Coahuila, a semi-arid region of northern Mexico. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Companion: The 1000-year-old mummified dog is the first one to be found in Mexico and could help archaeologists unravel the secrets of the country's ancient tribes . Predator: History experts are excited as it raises the possibility that the animal was domesticated and used to hunt . The discovery is a first of its kind for Mexico, with mummified canines only previously found in Peru and Egypt. Experts believe that the dog was domesticated by a local tribe and used in hunting expeditions. Archaeologist Alejandro Bautista Valdespino said: 'It reinforces the idea that dogs were placed as companions in the funerary traditions of the region’s nomads, it also presents the possibility that these animals were domesticated.' Ancient: The mysterious dog will undergo a series of tests to discover its age and breed . The animal, believed to have been mummified naturally, was found alongside hundreds of human remains, as well as thousands of ancient artifacts including textiles, baskets, and bows and arrows. Archaeologist Yuri De La Rosa said: 'This is the first mummified canine that has an archaeological context. 'In this case it’s a natural mummification because of the desert and dry conditions. The skin dried to the bones and it was mummified naturally.' The ancient hound will soon be measured, X-rayed and carbon tested to determine its exact age and breed.","First ever mummified dog to be found in Mexico .

"Teacher Priscilla Davo Ortego has been suspended amid allegations she sellotaped children's mouths closed . A primary school teacher has been suspended for Sellotaping over the mouths of her 10-year-old pupils after they refused to stop giggling and talking. Priscila Davo Ortega, 27, allegedly lined up more than 20 children during her art lesson and put layers of sticky tape across their lips because they were being too noisy. Parents said that when some children ripped off the tape because they were struggling to breathe, the Spanish-born teacher replaced it. Other children were left with bleeding lips when the tape was removed, and several said that they were scared about returning to school. Miss Ortega has been suspended from teaching art and Spanish at Danesfield Church of England middle school in Williton, Somerset, pending an investigation. Police said they would work with the local education authority. Parents learned what had happened when their children returned home on Monday. The Year 6 pupils said Miss Ortega imposed the punishment because they were making too much noise while playing a game of blind man’s bluff. Lisa Duffield, said: ‘I was absolutely disgusted when my daughter told me what the teacher had done. I went straight round the school and demanded to speak to Mr Bradbury, the headteacher. ‘I told Mr Bradbury that under no circumstances was my daughter to be taught by her until this matter was sorted out. I didn’t trust myself to speak to the teacher myself, as I feared I might slap her.’ Sarah Gower, 38, of Williton, said: ‘The teacher did not like that they were giggling too loud, told them all to be quiet, and if they weren’t quiet she would put Sellotape over their mouths, which she did. ‘A couple of them had difficulty breathing, so they ripped it off and she put more on top. My son was confused about what happened and he was a bit scared about going to school this morning.’ Upset: Pupil Thomas Bradbury said some friendss had rashes after the Sellotape placed over their mouths to keep them quiet was torn off . Stacey Bradbury, 28, from Watchet, Somerset, said she was ‘disgusted, shocked, traumatised’ by Miss Ortega’s actions. Her . 10-year-old son Thomas said: ‘She put Sellotape on our mouths just . because we were talking. Some people had a really bad rash after and . some girls in my class had their lips bleeding.’ Rob Lovell, 33, of Williton, said his 10-year-old daughter told him Miss Ortega said she was carrying out an ‘experiment’ to see how long the children could be quiet. ‘When my daughter took the tape off her mouth, it split her lips and they were bleeding,’ he said. ‘The same thing happened to quite a few of the pupils. They were all very upset.’ Miss Ortega is from the village of Huetor Santillan, near Granada. She worked as a nanny in London from November 2010 to June 2011, before returning to Spain to complete a master’s degree in secondary education. A teacher has been accused of taping up the mouths of 10-year-olds at Danesfield Church of England School, Williton, Somerset . The teacher has now been suspended and the school has launched an investigation . She did a month-long placement at Danesfield in 2012, and began working there full-time in January. In May last year, she wrote on Facebook: ‘Now for sure, next school year, I will be an art and Spanish teacher in Danesfield School in pretty Sommerset[sic]! A bit nervous but happy.’ Last night, Miss Ortega’s family said she must have acted ‘in jest’ and not to punish the children. Pablo Davo, her uncle, who lives next door to her parents Jorge and Mari Trini in Huetor Santillan, said: ‘Sellotaping children’s mouths up because they’re being noisy would be totally out of character for Priscila. 'Avoid discussion with the media': A copy of a letter to parents of pupils at Danesfield Church of England School . Avon and Somerset Police confirmed they had spoken to one family but added that they would not be taking any further action . ‘She loves her job and she loves children and she never mentioned any problems when she was back here a couple of weeks ago.’ Danesfield School was rated as ‘good’ in its most recent Ofsted report, and the incident happened on the first day of lessons since it became an academy. Headteacher Ian Bradbury said: ‘The wellbeing of our children is of vital importance to us. An incident happened in a lesson on Monday. Following that incident, I have suspended the teacher involved until a full and thorough investigation has taken place.’ Pupils at Danesfield School said the incident came during a 'trust game' where they were led round the room by classmates while their eyes were closed. Speaking outside the school gates, Ryan Knowles, 11, said Ms Davo put . seven pieces of tape on his mouth which remained in place for 25 . minutes. The schoolboy said: 'She told us if we weren't quiet she . would tape our mouths up and then went to the cupboard, got it out and . lined us all up. 'I was thinking and saying to her 'why are you . doing this?' It is ridiculous and it was upsetting. I'm scared now about . if I have to go back into her class. I don't know what she might do . next.' Ryan's father Adam, 34, said the incident flew in the face of the trust he put in teachers to look after his son. The paper mill worker said: 'All those teachers in there are strangers to me, but you have to trust them. Ryan Knowles, 11, said Ms Davo put seven pieces of tape on his mouth which remained in place for 25 minutes . 'But then this happens - it's disgusting.' Lisa Duffield, 42, said her daughter Ella, 11, is refusing to go into class with the teacher again. The shop assistant said: 'It's disgusting. I can't believe it has happened. 'Ella is quite sensitive like lots of girls her age and she was very angry. She said: ""Mum I'm not going back into that class with that teacher ever again"". 'The most upsetting thing about the whole thing is you take them to school trusting they will be looked after by adults. 'I want her gone. This is disgusting. I've been told that the kids are going to get a full apology from the teacher. I hope so. 'If I had done that to Ella and she came into school and told them I would have had social services called.' Cheryl Mills' daughter Jess, ten, told the teacher she was allergic to sticky tape but was still given the punishment. The mother-of-three said: 'I feel very let down. She isn't allergic but she just panicked and didn't know what to do. 'She told her she was allergic but it made no difference. She was one of two kids who took it off. 'Jess was a bit shocked and upset. She didn't know what to say or how to feel.'","Spanish and art teacher Priscilla Davo Ortega taped children's mouths shut .

"Prize-winning author Hilary Mantel has courted controversy again by claiming the poor were treated better centuries ago than under David Cameron’s Government. The historical writer said a ‘mood of harshness’ had taken over Britain and those in poverty were now portrayed as ‘morally defective’ by the Coalition. The 62-year-old sparked outrage last year when she said the Duchess of Cambridge was a ‘plastic princess’ and ‘born to breed’. Prize-winning author Hilary Mantel has courted controversy again by claiming the poor were treated better centuries ago than under David Cameron’s Government . She also recently attracted criticism after penning a short story about the IRA murdering Margaret Thatcher. And in an interview to promote the German-language version of the story this week, she said the Tudors had more of an advanced view than Britain today on how the needy should be treated. She said: ‘When people feel they’re being mistreated, they lash out against people who are weaker than themselves, immigrants for example. What’s happening here at the moment is really ugly.’ She told German newspaper Der Spiegel: ‘The government portrays poor and unfortunate people as being morally defective. This is a return to the thinking of the Victorians. ‘Even in the 16th century, Thomas Cromwell was trying to tell people that a thriving economy has casualties and that something must be done by the state for people out of work. ‘Even back then, you saw the tide turning against this idea that poverty was a moral weakness. Who could have predicted that it would come back into style? ‘It’s myth making on a grand scale, and it’s poisonous.’ Mantel, who was awarded the Man Booker Prize twice for Wolf Hall – an account of the rise of Henry VIII’s confident Thomas Cromwell – and its sequel, Bring Up the Bodies. She said: ‘Many people are poorer than they were five or six years ago. The last few years of austerity after the banking crisis have opened up a wider gap between rich and poor. Enfield North MP Nick de Bois (pictured) dismissed the author’s 'extraordinary' claims as fiction . ‘What’s put to the electorate is: You can’t have this, you can’t have that, because there’s no money in the pot. But it’s not really a question of resources. It’s a question of ideology, which is moving to the right. It wishes to reduce the role of government and it strives for a small state.’ She also told the German paper that her comments on Kate Middleton had been taken out of context, and she said the Prime Minister’s criticism of her that followed was ‘unwise’. She said: ‘He was misguided in being rushed into comment about something he knew nothing of.’ And she defended her recent short story on the murder of Mrs Thatcher – which prompted outrage and even calls for a police investigation from some quarters. She said: ‘I was prepared, but bringing in the police for an investigation was beyond anything I could have planned or hoped for, because it immediately exposes them to ridicul. ‘These people don’t know how to read fiction, they were professionally outraged. I don’t know if the reactions would have been the same if a male writer like Martin Amis or Ian McEwan had published this. ‘I don’t need a defence, but what I would ask them is: Do you think Ms Thatcher shied away from controversy? Do you think she cared overly much about public opinion? ‘Thatcher was the first woman in Downing Street, but imitated a man. When I say this, it seems like a joke, but I think Margaret Thatcher had a great deal of trouble understanding and coming to terms with her own femininity.’ But Enfield North MP Nick de Bois dismissed the author’s 'extraordinary' claims as fiction. The Tory said: ‘With more people working than ever before and unemployment lower than it was before the last election it beggars belief that Ms Mantel make this claim - like a Hollywood historian she doesn’t let the facts ruin her storyline.’","Hilary Mantel claims poor treated better centuries ago than under Coalition .

"Television and film scenes that show adultery, one-night stands or feature pornographic content have been banned in China. The country's media and television regulator has issued a letter to content providers outlining that all content related to sexual abuse, one-night stands, polyamorous relationships and extra-marital affairs must be deleted from video streaming websites. The State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television demanded that any program with pornographic content must be removed, reported Sina. As part of a government crackdown on pornography, Chinese authorities have ordered content providers to remove all sexually suggestive content. File photo . It also said that content depict rape, masturbation, prostitution and necrophilia must also be cut. Websites must remove everything, including headlines and pictures, that refer to sex and nudity - as well as plots that show violent murder, suicide, kidnapping, drug abuse, gambling or anything supernatural. The move has sparked fears that the regulation means audiences in China will have very few television dramas or films to watch. Tan Tian, a professor a Jinan University, told the Global Times: 'Media regulators used to have loose regulations on [these] programs, so that the public is often exposed to contents related to sex, violence and murder.' He added the watchdog should not be extreme in its regulations as it could prevent programs being made in the future. The move is part of the Chinese government's campaign against pornography and lewd content called 'Cleaning the Web 2014'. In April this year, more than 100 websites have been shut down, according to the State Internet Information Office. Chinese celebrities attend the party for Sohu's online streaming website to share their passion for US TV shows in Beijing. File photo . Last month, Chinese authorities ordered television stations, cinemas, online entertainment sites and other outlets not to show works by entertainers found to have been involved in vice crimes such as using drugs or visiting prostitutes. A directive cited directors, playwrights and actors whose misdeeds included using drugs or hiring prostitutes had corrupted society's moral standards. It added the rules are aimed at cleansing screens, airwaves and cyberspace to ensure that core socialist values are promoted. Although the industry's regulating agency — the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television — has not released the internal document or officially acknowledged it, the Communist Party-run People's Daily confirmed the ban by quoting unnamed insiders in an online report. The English-language China Daily also reported the ban, as did the news portal Sina, which published the content of the directive issued on September 28.","Country's media watchdog said all pornographic content must be deleted .

"Three experimental treatments will be used on Ebola patients in West Africa from next month as health workers attempt to bring the viral outbreak under control. At one site in Guinea victims will be given blood transfusions from recovered patients, while at two different locations medics will begin using new antiviral drugs. All three treatments have been fast-tracked into use without the usual lengthy trials on animals and healthy people, but doctors believe it is the only way of stopping the infection spreading further. Blood plasma therapy, in which the blood of an Ebola survivor is pumped into a sufferer to boost their immune system, has been used before but the precise effects have not been studied. Medics will begin treating Ebola patients in West Africa using blood transfusions and two new types of antiviral drugs at three different sites from next month . The treatments have been fast-tracked into use without the lengthy trials on humans and animals, but medics insist they are needed to bring the deadly outbreak under control . Doctor Craig Spencer, who caught the virus in Guinea  before carrying it back to New York, was given blood from nurse Nancy Writebol while in isolation at a hospital in the city. Spanish nurse Teresa Romero was also given a blood transfusion after she caught the virus treating two missionaries. Both patients have recovered and been released from hospital after testing negative for Ebola. Doctors from the Antwerp Institute of Tropical Medicine will begin the first widespread trial of blood plasma therapy at an Ebola centre in Conakry, Guinea, next month. The first antiviral drug, known as brincidofovir, is being tested by Oxford University at a separate site in Liberia, though researchers have not revealed exactly where. The drug comes in tablet form and needs to be taken twice a week for two weeks. The drug works by interfering with the way the virus multiplies within healthy human cells. It will be given to 140 patients, with their consent, and doctors will compare their survival rates against those who were not treated. Peter Horby, who is overseeing the trial of the drug, said: 'If we're going to find a treatment, we have to do it now - which is why we have to accelerate these trials.' A second antiviral, favipiravir, will be administered at a third site in Guinea. Mrs Romero was also thought to have been given this drug before recovering from Ebola, but authorities would not confirm its use. Transfusions involve pumping blood from a recovered Ebola patient into a sick person. The treatment has been used before, such as on New York doctor Craig Spencer (pictured) but has not been widely tested . While there is evidence that blood transfusions are effective, their use is highly controversial among native West Africans, many of whom hold to spiritual beliefs . While it is hoped that the new treatments will help to stop the largest and deadliest outbreak of Ebola in history, their success is far from certain. The antiviral drugs are largely untested on humans, so it is not known exactly what effect they will have on the virus. While there is some anecdotal evidence that blood transfusions can help patients recover, their use is highly controversial among the native West African people. Identifying people who have recovered from the disease, taking their blood, transporting it to the patient and then administering it in countries whose healthcare systems have been wiped out also poses huge challenges. The worst outbreak of the virus on record has claimed at least 5,160 lives in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea so far. Cases of the disease have also been reported in Nigeria, where eight people have died, and Mali, where four have been killed. A team from Oxford University will test one antiviral, known as brincidofovir, which works by disrupting the way the Ebola virus divides inside human cells . A team from Oxford Univeristy will test one of the antivirals, known as brincidofovir, which works by disrupting the way the Ebola virus divides inside human cells . Officials in Mali believed they had eradicated the disease after quarantining everyone who had come into contact with a two-year-old girl who arrived from Guinea carrying the disease. However a second infected man arrived and passed the disease to a nurse, who died on Tuesday, prompting 90 more people to be placed in isolation. The country's president, Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, says he has no plans to close the border with Guinea for the moment, but has called on the World Health Organisation to step up their response to the crisis.","Doctors will test blood transfusion therapy and two new antiviral drugs .

"More than a decade since their last tour, Culture Club’s reunion shows have been awaited with great anticipation. But fans will have to wait a little longer before seeing the band take to the stage as the concerts have been cancelled due to Boy George’s health. The singer, whose real name is George O’Dowd, 53, has said he is ‘devastated’ to call off the tour but has been forced to due to a serious throat infection. Scroll down for video . Culture Club, pictured, Mikey Craig, left, Roy Hay, centre, and Boy George, right, were planning a reunion tour but were forced to cancel after the lead singer, real name George O'Dowd, developed a throat complaint . It is believed he could be suffering from vocal polyps that require surgery, the same condition that has previously forced Adele to cancel shows. The band – which had 12 top 40 hits in the 1980s and 90s – were due to perform in front of a sold out crowd at the Agua Caliente Casino in Rancho Mirage, California tomorrow. However, some tickets holders received an automated call this informing them the show had been cancelled, which has since been confirmed by the band. A spokesman for the group said: ‘It is with great sadness that iconic band Culture Club have had to cancel their December UK tour. ‘The tough decision has been made due to lead singer Boy George suffering from a serious throat condition, for which medical treatment is currently underway.’ And the singer himself added: ‘I’m devastated but I want to be able to perform to the best of my ability and the specialist has told me that right now that will be impossible. I will focus on getting better and see all my fans soon’. Boy George is believed to have developed polyps, which forced Adele, pictured to cancel several shows . The group were due to play 10 shows across America before beginning an 11-date UK arena tour from 1 December. It was to be the first tour featuring Boy George, bassist Mikey Craig, guitarist and keyboardist Roy Hay and drummer Jon Moss since 2002. The group have already recorded a new album, Tribes, which is due to be released early next year. A polyp is a fluid-filled collection that forms when a vocal cord if they are not rested. Other singers to have suffered from them include Bjork and Keith Urban. Ticket holders can claim refunds from their point of purchase.","Culture Club had planned a tour of the US before returning to the UK .

"Whether they are acting as a tour guide or providing up-to-the-second flight information, smartwatches and other gadgets are poised to  revolutionise the way we travel. Wearable technology is increasingly seen as the wave of the future when it comes to speeding up the check-in process, taking the stress out of travel and providing the best possible experience for the traveller. Google Glass and smartwatches are being trialled by airports and airlines as the world of travel seeks to embrace new technology and find ways to use it to its advantage. Scroll down for video . Virgin Atlantic has already been impressed with the results of its Google Glass testing . Hotel chains are developing apps that allow smartwatches to act as room keys . Researchers expect a large proportion of people to embrace wearable technology in the near future and they say it may follow the same trajectory as the smartphone and tablets. Juniper Research expects worldwide spending on wearable technology to hit £870m this year and £12bn by 2018. As the technology becomes more mainstream,  more than 19 million wearable devices are expected to be sold in 2014 and the global market is expected to reach 111.9 million units in 2018, according to International Data Corporation (IDC), a research firm. Virgin Atlantic have already announced plans to extend its trial of Google Glass for check-ins after a positive test run in a lounge at London Heathrow Airport, and Edinburgh Airport gave its staff the headsets to help with customer questions and monitor flight times. Iberia and Samsung have developed a wearable boarding pass using a smartwatch . And Iberia airlines has teamed with tech giant Samsung to develop a wearable boarding pass using a new app that can be installed on Samsung's Gear 2 and Gear Neo smartwatches – eliminating the need for a paper document. Similar to boarding passes on mobile phones, passengers who are wearing one of the devices can simply scan the electronic bar code on the app to get through airport checkpoints and onto their flight. A handful of airlines have gradually been incorporating smartwatch technology to make it easier for customers to book or manage their flights. Earlier this year Spanish low-cost carrier Vueling partnered with Sony to create the first smartwatch-based boarding pass, and Air Berlin announced its own app using Pebble’s smartwatches. Sabre's travel app TripCase is expected to plan more than 25 million trips this year . Apps for smartphones and smartwatches can warn users of any changes to flights and transfers . After showcasing its Google Glass flight finder app at World Travel Market in London, global travel technology company Sabre has announced the next step in developing travel programmes that work across a number of wearable devices including smartwatches and Google Glass. The move reflects the company's view that wearables will have a dramatic impact on the way consumers shop for and experience travel. This will extend to the way they discover local hotspots and navigate destinations, as well as board the plane. Wearable technology could prove to be a godsend for tourists to speed up the check-in process . Spending on wearable technology will hit £870m this year, researchers predict . TripCase, Sabre's leading travel app, is the first  of its kind to integrate with the highly-anticipated Samsung Gear S smartwatch, launched recently in the UK. The integration allows travellers to tap a notification to open the TripCase app and will include a click-to-call feature starting next month. In addition, consumers using Android Wear devices and the Pebble and Pebble Steel watches can receive TripCase  notifications directly to their wearable devices. TripCase users wearing these smart devices will receive real-time alerts for flight or gate changes and other travel information conveniently on their wrists when every minute counts. TripCase is on pace to manage more than 25 million trips in 2014. Edinburgh Airport is the first in the UK to use Google Glass, which is equipped with an optical display . The Google Glass trial by Virgin has been declared a success after starting in February . 'As the adoption of wearable technology grows, we want to ensure that the travel industry is ready to leverage this technology and serve travellers on the device they prefer,' said John Samuel, senior vice president of Sabre Traveller Solutions. 'Wearable technology is fast becoming a prominent means of customer notification and communication. We're looking to take it even further - from a one-way means of communication to an interactive, on-the-go service experience.' Sabre's Google Glass flight finder app was the company's first foray into testing wearable devices and operates by finding flights based on voice commands . Mr Samuel added: 'Wearable technologies - such as smartwatches and heads-up devices like Google Glass - will forever change the way consumers experience travel - from shopping via virtual reality to voice command recommendation. 'Creating these full service experiences require not just smart devices but also more precise location services and smart recommendation services.'","Smartwatches and Google Glass already trialled across the world .

"One unusual and extraordinary school is giving hope to the most troubled and violent pupils. The Ian Mikardo High School is a last chance education centre for children excluded from mainstream education. It's a place where daily fights, spitting, and cursing are all part of the attempts to teach some of the most challenging children in the country, and turn their behaviour around before it is too late. The school, situated in East London, is often seen as the end of the line for the pupils, many of whom have a range of behavioural problems and risk ending up in jail. Scroll down for video . Out of control: Classes at The Ian Mikardo High School often descend into chaos, with pupils fighting either staff or each other . Viloence: The school is often seen as the end of the line for the pupils, many of whom have a range of behaviour problems and risk ending up in jail . Boys can arrive at any time during their secondary education, usually after being expelled from a mainstream school. Now the subject of a Channel 5 documentary 'Too tough to teach', viewers are able to see the fraught atmosphere in which classes are taught. Play fights escalate within seconds, turning to real violence as the boys throw punches and teachers attempt to intervene. One incident sees a teacher attempting to talk a boy through his work as another verbally abuses him, swearing and spitting on his head. In another lesson a pupil physically hits sheets of paper out of the teachers hand, swearing in her face while another boy lifts a chair above his head in a menacing manner, while the rest of the class run riot as the staff desperately attempt to regain order and focus the boys on their work. Ray, 14, was permanently excluded from his school for unprovoked physical attacks on teachers and pupils. Like many of the boys at the Ian Mikardo High School, Ray has a difficult home life. The eldest of five children, Ray lives with his siblings and single mother Rowshan in a two bedroom council flat just one mile from the school. Surrounded by piles of boxes and belongings, Ray's tiny bed is squeezed into a box room he shares with his brother, while his mother shares a double bed with his three sisters, sleeping sideways to create enough space. The flat is the third temporary home Ray has lived in and the family may be moved on at any time. Troubled: Ray, 14, was excluded from his school for unprovoked physical attacks on teachers and pupils . No detentions: Despite the extremely challenging pupils, head teacher Claire Lillis runs the school without any official system of punishment . ‘Ray has a huge amount of issues that he’s currently dealing with,' explains head teacher Claire Lillis.'Given the context of his life outside of school, for some boys it is incredible that they have actually made it here in the first place. ‘What concerns me about Ray is he is clearly very physically strong. Being able to express himself verbally and being able to communicate and express his emotions is something he finds exceptionally difficult. He could end up really seriously hurting someone.' A keen boxer, Ray devotes up to three hours a day after school to his training, but is unable to prevent his fighting skills from spilling over into the classroom. ‘Ray uses his shadow boxing when he's in a state of anxiety. I think his release is going into that momentum and he gets that close to staff or other students and you think, this isn't healthy,' Claire explains. ‘I've wanted to be a boxer since I was little. I want to be on TV, I want money and sick cars and a mansion,' Ray says, later, in a brief moment of calm, confessing to a teacher that he intends to give all the money from his first big win to his mother. A talented boxer, Ray - seen here 'play punching' a teacher- finds it difficult to express himself in any way other than violence . Home life: The eldest of five children, Ray lives with his siblings and single mother Rowshan (pictured centre with Ray's youngest sister) in a two bedroom council flat just one mile from the school . Like the other boys at the school, Ray engages in fighting of both a verbal and physical nature on a near daily basis, as well as being easily distracted during lessons. However, despite the extremely challenging pupils, head teacher Claire runs the school without any official system of punishment. There are no detentions or rewards and the boys are never physically restrained. Instead the school attempts to help the boys learn to control their own actions and focuses on conflict resolution. Claire explains: 'If we intervene and if we restrain they are reliant on us for literally holding them back, but what we are trying to do is for them to find their own breaks.' Sanctuary: Time  in a salon is one of the most peaceful for Ray, and where he is most likely to open up . As well as attempting to change his behaviours through teaching the boys how to handle their emotions more appropriately, the school uses more unconventional methods. In addition to art and design classes, it has a full salon within the building, where as well as learning hair cutting skills, boys can enjoy full facials and manicures. Time out in the salon is one of the most peaceful for Ray, apparently allowing him to lower his boundaries for a short period. And after a few months at Ian Mikardo, improvements begin to show in Ray's demeanour. Though he still often turns to violence to express himself, he is sent on a week's work experience to a local gym and is not only able to control his temper, but manages to communicate well with clients and other staff, gaining praise for his work at the end of the week. ‘What we want to do is channel Rays passion for boxing. It’s something that he loves and something that he excels at, but we also want to show him that there’s a broader world than boxing as well,' Claire says. Too Tough to Teach airs this evening at 9pm on Channel 5 .","The Ian Mikardo High School is a last chance education centre .

"An eagle-eyed photographer has created a stunning montage showing the a time lapse of the moment a bird of prey swooped in on its dinner. Photographer Christian Kneidinger spent nine hours in a bush in Scotland waiting to capture the eagle as it flew by in a split-second to grab a fish from the water. The Austrian nature photographer said he used up all his patience to get the right shot - which paid off when he snapped the moment the bird went fishing. Patient: Christian Kneidinger, who waited nine hours to capture this eagle as it grabbed his prey, combined three shots to create this montage . He said: 'I was deep under the long grass, by the side of the lake. 'It's important the eagle does not see me, or he might not fly so close. 'I waited a very long time to get the perfect shot, it's a good job because I was getting hungry as well.' To create the montage, Mr Kneidinger combined three shots, taken with a Canon EOS 5D Mark III, to show the eagle's swift movements as it descended on the water, grabbed the fish, then flew off. Hungry: The photographer said he waited a long time to get the perfect shot of the eagle, pictured as it it swoops down close to the water .

"A leather jacket tagged by iconic artist Jean-Michel Basquiat and other legendary underground artists from the 1980s sold for $9,100 at a Manhattan auction yesterday. The size 42 coat sold to an online bidder  at Swann Auction Galleries, just under its pre-sale high estimate of $10,000. The auction house confirmed that the supple white leather jacket was sold by the original owner, Rico Espinet, who managed Danceteria from 1981 to 1986 and now owns an art and design store in Brooklyn. Personal effects: A leather jacket tagged by Jean-Michel Basquiat and other personalities of New York City's 1980s underground art scene sold for $9,100 yesterday . During his time working at the club, Mr Espinet asked one of the elevator operators, a woman called Joy, to use the jacket as a blank canvas for celebrity guests to sign. Her part in helping to create the artistic outerwear has been commemorated in its own tag, which reads 'Joystick' and can be seen scribbled in large black letters highlighted in blue on the jacket's verso. Its author is not known. Mr Basquiat's contribution includes schematic drawings and the words 'breast' and 'corset'. Sketchy behavior: Rico Espinet, the former stage manager of the legendary 80s nightclub Danceteria, asked one of the elevator operators to use the jacket as a blank canvas for celebrity guests to sign . Fashion designer and artist Stephen Sprouse inscribed 'Serenity Prayer' in mirror image along the collar. Street artists Jep 2, Stash and Energy also left tags, all done in permanent black marker. The writers of some of the tags are not known. Mr Basquiat had his start on the streets of New York. His first public exhibition was in 1980. One of his paintings sold at auction last year for $23.7 million. Portrait of the artist: Mr Basquiat, pictured in the 1980s at a Soho gallery, contributed schematic drawings and the words 'breast' and 'corset' to the jacket . He died in 1988 of a drug overdose at age 27. But while Mr Basquiat is gone, his art lives on. Prints of 35 of his most famous works went on sale at Selfridges for the first time in October. And the Brooklyn Museum is currently planning an exhibition on the artist that includes eight rarely seen notebooks filled with his handwritten texts and sketches, which will open in April.","The leather coat was bought by an online bidder at Swann Galleries, New York .

"Russian police are hunting a mysterious gang that has terrorised Moscow motorists in recent months with a series of murders resembling the violent video game Grand Theft Auto. The gang - dubbed the GTA gang by Russian media after the video game that involves gangland-style robberies and killings  - is believed to have killed about 15 people. In the dead of night, the gang members place metal spikes on roads just outside Moscow to burst the tyres of passing cars, then ruthlessly gun down their drivers and disappear. Among their victims are a policeman, a senior banker, and even a former dancer from a famous folk dancing troupe. In a sign of how seriously the crimes are being treated, the police have teamed up with the FSB security agency, the successor to the KGB, to tackle the murders and President Vladimir Putin has gotten personally involved. Scroll down for video . A police sketch (left) gives a rough idea of the appearance of one of the suspected GTA gang members, who are responsible for the killing of policeman Oleg Tolmachev (right) Police and media gather around the corpse of Oleg Tolmachev as police struggle to track down the criminals . A screenshot from the game Grand Theft Auto 4. Russian media have nicknamed the group after the game . 'Essentially, this crime is terrorist by nature,' Putin told Interior Minister Vladimir Kolokoltsev late last week. 'I know you are working together with the security services, with the FSB. I hope you will see this through.' Kolokoltsev reported to Putin after law enforcement agencies reportedly caught several members of the gang, and the Russian strongman commended police for 'solving' the crime. But investigators and police have been unusually tight-lipped about the case, and the vast mystery shrouding the crimes and the hunt for the attackers has bred a wealth of eyebrow-raising theories. Government newspaper Rossiiskaya Gazeta, citing law enforcement sources, said the gang did not gun people down for money. The gang calls itself 'jaamat' (group in Arabic) and is on a mission to hunt down 'infidels,' said the government mouthpiece. According to another popular version, the attackers are militants affiliated with Islamists who are using the roads around Moscow as a training ground to prepare to join their cause in Syria or elsewhere. Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the leader of the ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic Party, pointed the finger at Ukrainians who are fighting a Moscow-backed separatist uprising - and, the West and Kiev say, Russian troops - in eastern Ukraine. 'This is the work of professional subversive elements from Ukraine. They are taking revenge on us,' said Zhirinovsky. Alexey Tysganov ran from his car when he realised his tyres had been slashed but the 53-year-old was gunned down . Andrei Soldatov, the founder of Agentura.ru website that tracks the security services, said the case seemed utterly bizarre. 'There are too many sensationalist leads - Ukrainians, Islamists,' he said. 'These are so easy to use for propaganda purposes.' After refusing to comment for days, the Investigative Committee, which reports directly to Putin, broke its silence on Wednesday, saying it had already arrested the first suspects. One of the gang leaders put up armed resistance and was killed, the Investigative Committee said in a statement, referring to the gang as the 'so-called GTA.' 'Investigators established that when killing people, gang members were guided only by motives of profit, stealing their victims' money,' it said. Investigators said that 'the hypothesis that members of the gang were mimicking the GTA computer game has not been proven.' The arrests apparently came as part of a major operation in which law enforcement agencies rounded up a group of guest workers from Central Asia last week. According to law enforcement leaks reported in Russian media, the suspected ringleader of the gang was shot dead near Moscow as he tried to attack police with a hand grenade. In the latest twist, investigators said Thursday that one of the ringleaders had rented a house from a senior official in the prosecutor-general's office. A map of the attacks dotted around the Moscow region shows how dispersed the group's violence has been . A huge cache of arms and ammunition are believed to have been recovered from the house. Political analyst Alexei Makarkin chalked up the secrecy surrounding the case to its extreme sensitivity. 'This case is explosive,' Makarkin said. 'The authorities will do anything to avoid ethnic clashes. These can be exploited by ultra-right nationalists to call for the persecution of migrants.' Social tensions have risen dramatically in Russia this year, fuelled by a Moscow-based separatist uprising in Ukraine, Western sanctions and growing unemployment. Putin has repeatedly slammed attempts to inflame nationalist sentiments, evoking the country's multi-ethnic, multi-confessional history. Many insist the investigators have detained the wrong people, or are not telling the entire story. A group of volunteer vigilantes - some armed with handguns - have organised regular patrols along the roads near Moscow in a bid to nab the killers. Opposition newspaper Novaya Gazeta, seen as a thorn in the Kremlin's side, urged its readers to help solve the crime. Sergei Kanev, a journalist investigating the gang for Novaya Gazeta, said he found the investigators' statements puzzling. 'It was said before the bandits had not been taking their victims' belongings,' he said. 'I still believe that the GTA gang is at large,' he added. 'People, you must be vigilant.'","The groups' victims include a policeman, a banker and famous folk dancer .

"A former mayor and her grown-up daughter kept dozens of animals in squalid conditions at their home which 'stank of urine and faeces', a court has heard. Pamela Ann Crisp-Beard, 63, and her daughter Maria, 24, kept a menagerie at their cramped terraced home in Horncastle, Lincolnshire. The pets included 15 rabbits, a golden pheasant, two guinea pigs, five mice, two rats, a cat, two dogs, four domestic ducks, a goose and 22 chickens, a parrot and two ferrets. Neighbours contacted the RSCPA over concerns about the animals and officers discovered they were living in filthy conditions and the pair were arrested. Pamela Ann Crisp-Beard (pictured left) , 63, and her daughter Maria (pictured right), 24, are on trial at Skegness Magistrates Court  accused of six animal welfare offences . The mother and daughter denied six animal welfare charges and are on trial at Skegness Magistrates Court. Pamela Ann Crisp-Beard was Mayor of Horncastle between May 1997 and May 1998, and a Horncastle town councillor between 2003 and 2011, the court heard. She and her daughter kept some of the animals indoors, including in a bedroom, at their home, while others were left in the back garden. RSPCA inspector Deborah Scotcher told the court that when she visited the house on January 13 this year her feet squelched on the hall carpets because they were sodden with urine. The court heard that some of the cages were stacked floor to ceiling at the pairs terraced home . The mother and daughter are appealing the decision to remove all of the animals, including 15 rabbits, from the home . One of the dogs found at the home of Pamela Ann Crisp-Beard, 63, and her daughter Maria, 24, in Lincolnshire . RSPCA inspector Deborah Scotcher alleged that the majority of the animals did not have food or clean drinking water . She gave the pair three days to improve the situation but when she returned there was no improvement. Ms Scotcher came back a third time with two police officers and a vet on January 29, and took the animals away. She told the court: 'The entire place stank of urine and faeces and several rooms, including the kitchen, were cold, dank and dark, and full of rubbish and other debris. 'Some of the animals were kept in cages stacked from floor to ceiling in the front room and there was a gaping hole in the ceiling. 'Some of the dirty straw inside the cages was inches thick with excrement. 'I struggled to identify the golden pheasant, kept in the back garden of the property, because it was so badly caked in mud and faeces. 'On my first visit I found some of the animals were kept in cages with filthy, sodden straw. 'The cages were not suitable for the animals housed in them and some food bowls were empty, while others contained stagnant dirty water. 'Conditions outside were squalid, the garden was full of mud, faeces and urine, and my feet squelched in the mud and faeces.' Ms Scotcher claimed the majority of the animals did not have food or clean drinking water. The house was first visited on January 13 after an anonymous call to the RSPCA's national hotline. During the first RSPCA visit both Pamela and Maria Crisp-Beard were present but while Ms Scotcher had grave concerns, she decided not to take any official action. The home where ex mayor Pamela Ann Crisp-Beard, 63, and her daughter Maria, 24, are accused of keeping a menagerie of animals in squalid conditions . She told the pair that she would return and expected to see a significant improvement in conditions, claiming she wanted to give them a 'second chance'. But upon returning three days later, the conditions had not improved and the house still smelled horrible. Among the problems was the fact that the rabbits, housed in two shed-like buildings, lacked suitable light and ventilation, and some animals outside had no proper shelter at all. Ms Scotcher then returned to the house a third time, now with two police officers and a vet, 16 days after her first visit. The vet inspected the animals and decided that the best course of action was to remove them from the property. Upon examination, one of the dogs appeared to be underweight and the rabbits had excrement matted in their fur. The court heard that while Pamela Crisp-Beard admitted to owning the animals, her daughter Maria also 'had a duty of care' because she often looked after them too. The Crisp-Beards are appealing the decision to seize the animals which have been kept in a private boarding sanctuary since January. The trial was adjourned until December 12.

"Violinist Nicola Benedetti has been made an ambassador for the project, which aims to bring classical music to primary schools . Ten pieces of classical music have been chosen for all primary school children to study, under a new initiative. The BBC has unveiled the works, which include those by Beethoven, Stravinsky and Handel, so more pupils will experience classical music. The project, called Ten Pieces, is being launched through a film that will then be used in lessons. A total of 150 arts organisations have signed up to the scheme and will go into schools to help run inter-active workshops about the pieces. Members of BBC orchestras will also visit classes along with special screenings and school concerts being held, in a programme that is due to launch this week. It comes amid fears that children are not being taught about classical music in preference to other subjects in the curriculum. Violinist Nicola Benedetti has been made an ambassador along with singer-songwriter Laura Mvula and Catatonia singer Cerys Matthews. Miss Benedetti, 27, yesterday told Radio 4: ‘There are few programmes, I can’t think of any in fact, that have such an intense dual focus, absolute quality in its presentation and no compromise in terms of the amount of children the programme wishes to reach.’ She has previously said: ‘Two aspects of the project stand out for me. The first is the sheer size. With over 150 organisations involved and the power of the BBC, the number of children likely to experience classical music could be enormous, and I hope will be. ‘The second is the quality with which classical music will be presented to the children, many of them probably for the very first time - first exposure can be vitally important, igniting a positive lifelong association with this great art form. ‘This experience, I am quite sure, will be exciting and enriching for all children, but above all is highly educational and substantive. This is something you cannot miss.’ Singer-songwriter Laura Mvula has also been made an ambassador for the Ten Pieces programme . BBC director general Tony Hall, who was previously chief executive of the Royal Opera House, said he hoped the scheme would reach virtually every UK primary school. ‘We want to excite and inspire children about the world of classic music,’ he said. Lord Hall added that, while classical music was ‘in good health’, its future popularity was not guaranteed ‘unless children are given the opportunity to learn and experience’ it. Cellist Julian Lloyd Webber said about the project: ‘The problem is that it’s patchy across the country. If you have a head teacher who believes in classical music then you’ll get a lot of that in the school. But if you have one that doesn’t it’s quite easy for them to sideline it altogether. ‘So this is perhaps a great tool for those kind of heads because it’s given to them and when they see the impact it has on the child that could help enormously.’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘Classical music is great for children. Not only is it good for their creativity, it can help with other subjects like maths, and even have a positive impact on behaviour. ‘While millions of people already enjoy classical music, it’s right that we light the classical music spark as early as possible. ‘The BBC is uniquely placed to help do this and we are delighted so many organisations have signed up to help us deliver the ambition of reaching virtually every child in the country.’","BBC unveiled the works, which also include Stravinsky and Mozart .

"Tainted drugs likely caused the deaths of 14 women in India and left dozens more in critical condition following botched sterilisation operations, according to an Indian health official. Police have closed six factories in the impoverished central state of Chhattisgarh today and arrested the owners after they were caught producing Indian-brand ibuprofen and ciprofloxacin. Both drugs have been banned under state law, and both were given to the women shortly after they were operated on, just before they started vomiting and fell ill. R K. Gupta, the Indian doctor arrested today for running the sterilisation 'camp', has denied claims his rusty tools infected the women, and instead blames the drugs he was given. Scroll down for video . R.K.Gupta, the doctor who performed the sterilisation surgeries, sits at a police station after being arrested . Gupta said he was under pressure from the state  to perform the operations. He also blamed the drugs used . Speaking from his cell he said that some of the sick women had been treated at a second, separate camp, proving that he is not to blame. He said: 'I am not the culprit. I have been made a scapegoat. It is the administration which is responsible for this incident.' Raman Singh, state chief minister, said: 'Owners of the companies responsible for the sale of drugs have been summoned. They will all be questioned and we have sealed their factories.' State health officials said police raided a local company, Mahawar Pharma, which had provided the antibiotics. The company's director, Sumit Mahawar, declined to comment . Postmortem examinations have so far failed to reveal the cause of death, and medics have requested chemical analysis be carried out to give them a fuller picture. Earlier today protesters burned tyres and clashed with riot police in angry demonstrations in India over the state-run sterilisation camp. Family members claim the women were 'herded like cattle' into the camp after being forced to take part in the programme aimed at curbing India's booming population. In another disturbing development, it emerged a woman died after a second sterilisation camp was held in the same state despite the death toll mounting from the first clinic two days earlier. Dr R. K Gupta was seized for questioning amid mounting anger over the tragedy in central Chhattisgarh state where women were paid to undergo a procedure. Indian Congress party activists argue with police as they demonstrate against the deaths of women who were sterilised in a government-run programme that left 14 dead and dozens more seriously ill . Angry protesters took to the streets demanding the chief minister's resignation in the state capital Raipur . 'He has been taken into custody. He will be produced in the court in the afternoon today. He is likely to be arrested soon after,' police inspector general Pawan Deo said from Bilaspur. SK Mandal, the chief medical officer in central Chhattisgarh state where the operations were performed, said the surgeon was arrested at a relative's house after he had gone into hiding. According to Dr Mandal, Gupta performed more than 80 sterilisation procedures in six hours - a breach of government protocol which prohibits surgeons from performing more than 30 in a day. Dr Mandal said investigators were trying to determine whether the women, all of them poor villagers, had been given tainted medicine during their time at the 'health camp'. The victims had suffered vomiting and a dramatic fall in blood pressure on Monday after undergoing laparoscopic sterilisation, a process in which the fallopian tubes are blocked. Fourteen have died and 16 are fighting for their lives. Police said they were planning to seize equipment used during the operations by Gupta amid fears that it was contaminated. Gupta said he was under pressure from the state government to perform the operations, while also blaming the drugs used. Angry clashes: Indian police detain a Congress party activist during a demonstration in Raipur . Indian Congress party activist shouts slogans from a police vehicle during a demonstration against the deaths of women who were sterilised in a government-run programme . 'It was not my fault - the administration pressured me to meet targets,' the doctor was quoted by NDTV as saying as he was being detained on Wednesday night. He said that all the patients began throwing up and complaining of dizziness and weakness after they were given medication following the operations. 'The surgeries went well but the problem was with the medicines given to the women,' he also alleged. 'I have been performing surgeries for a long time and there has never been any problem.' Gupta, who says he has conducted more than 50,000 such operations, denied that his equipment was rusty or dirty and said it was the government's duty to control the number of people that turned up at his family-planning 'camp'. 'It is up to the administration to decide how many women would be kept for operation,' a visibly upset Gupta told Reuters from the police station where he is being held in custody. He faces charges of causing death by negligence. 'If they kept in that place 83 women, it is my moral responsibility to operate (on) all the women. Seriously ill: A woman who underwent surgery at the government mass-sterilisation camp is moved to a private hospital from the Chhattisgarh Institute of Medical Sciences (CIMS) hospital in Bilaspur . A doctor takes a blood sample from a woman who underwent sterilization surgery at a government camp . 'If I decline to do that I would have faced public agitation,' said Gupta, who was awarded a state honour 10 years ago for his sterilisation work. The state government has banned the sale of six drugs used during the operations over concerns they were substandard, the Press Trust of India news agency said. The doctor carried out 83 operations in just five hours on the impoverished women, who were paid 1,400 rupees ($23) at a state-run camp in Bilaspur district at the weekend. Relatives today claimed they had been pressured into accepting the money, the equivalent of half a month's salary for a manual labourer. 'They herded them like cattle,' Mahesh Suryavanshi, the brother-in-law of one casualty, told the Indian Express newspaper, according to the Guardian. 'The [health workers] said nothing would happen, it was a minor operation.' Sadhu, the husband of one woman who died, added: 'I hope that he can never sleep in peace. 'The same thing should happen to him. Then he will know what it is like to lose someone in your family.' The government has suspended four health officials and ordered an investigation into the deaths. Tragedy: 13 women have died and dozens remain in hospital after a state-run mass sterilisation in India, which was carried out with rusty instruments and contaminated medicines . Recovery: Victims of surgeries lie on hospital beds after 13 women lost their lives in sterilization operations in Bilaspur, Chattisgarh, India . Government mass sterilization camps are held regularly in Chhattisgarh and other states as part of a long-running effort to control India's booming population . An Indian woman who underwent sterilisation surgery is carried on a stretcher for treatment at the CIMS hospital in Bilaspur, in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh . Tubectomies were carried out on 83 women by a single doctor in a government-run 'family planning camp' In the state capital of Raipur, angry protesters also took to the streets demanding the chief minister's resignation. News of a death at a second camp held after several deaths from the first will also increase pressure on authorities in the poverty-stricken Indian state. The Guardian reported that a woman died after surgery in the Chhattisgarh which was carried out even after several deaths had been reported from the first. Experts say the deaths are the result of a lack of medical oversight and the fact that the government in India sets sterilisation targets as part of its efforts to stabilise the population. India's government had said it stopped setting targets for sterilising women in the 1990s, but doctors and human rights workers have alleged for years that targets exist, leading to coercion in villages where most people have limited access to education and health care. Although the surgery is voluntary, rights groups say the target-driven nature of the programme has led to women being coerced into being sterilised, often in inadequate medical facilities. Lalit Mohan Pant, a surgeon who claims to have carried out the highest number of sterilisations in the world, defended the use of quotas as necessary to motivate government employees. Pant, who lives in central India, holds the record for sterilising 816 people in one day and says he has sterilised over 330,000 patients in all. 'I am doing god's work,' he said.","Police close down four drug factories and arrest owners after 14 die .

"The hike in tuition fees has caused 'wild and dangerous swings' in university admissions, with some institutions taking on 43 per cent fewer students that the previous year. The Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas) revealed that 51,000 fewer students started degree courses last autumn - a fall of 12 per cent - after fees nearly trebled to £9,000 a year. Ten of the 24 leading universities from the Russell Group, including Leeds, Imperial College London and Warwick, registered drops. Hardest hit: London Metropolitan University had 43 per cent fewer students starting degree courses last autumn compared to the previous year . London Metropolitan University, which last year had its licence to sponsor international students revoked, suffered the biggest fall at 43 per cent. Enrolment also dropped 13 per cent at the University of Southampton, 10% at the University of Liverpool and 9% at the University of Sheffield. There was also a 7 per cent decline at the University of Birmingham, Birmingham University and 6 per cent drops at the University of Leeds, Imperial and the University of London. But some institutions managed to buck the trend, including University College London, where enrolment rose 22 per cent, and the University of Cardiff, which posted an increase of 13 per cent. King's College London boasted a rise of 12 per, while admissions were up 11 per cent at the University of Edinburgh. Anger: Police attempt to hold back tuition fees protestors at the Conservative Party's campaign headquarters in Millbank, London, in 2010 . Shadow universities minster, Shabana Mahmood, said the figures show the Government's decision to raise the cap on fees is having a chaotic impact on higher education. She told The Guardian: 'Ucas reports wild and dangerous swings - with some huge losers and some winners - but the variations show severe volatility in the system that should be a concern for everyone. 'The government must now answer for the damage it has done to those universities that have suffered as a consequence of their reforms and decision to raise fees to £9,000' Ms Mahmood said the decline could have a devastating impact on local economies of cities such as Manchester and Leeds. Patrick McGhee, vice-chancellor of University of East London and chairman of Million+, which represents new universities, said the figures do not include a decline in students studying part-time. 'Chaotic': Labour says the Government 'must answer for the damage it has done' He told The Times: 'The need for Government to launch a campaign to promote the value of higher education is all too obvious.' In 2010, thousands of people staged a series of protests against a rise in fees ahead of the vote in the House of Commons. There were violent scenes at the Conservative Party's Millbank campaign headquarters in London. Protesters stormed the building and a fire extinguisher was thrown from the roof. The Liberal Democrats bore the brunt of many people's anger and last year Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg apologised for an election pledge not to raise fees.","Ten of the 24 leading universities register drops .

"Schoolies could face being banned from the Gold Coast or slapped with heavy fines under new laws in a bid to crack down on drunken and troublemaking behaviour. Queensland police have issued a blunt warning to school leavers from all over Australia, who are preparing to head to the annual event in Surfers Paradise of Queensland from November 22. The new laws will enable police to remove anyone causing a public nuisance, drug-related problems, violence or misbehaving from the Gold Coast or those who go against the ban will face heavy fines of more than $8000, according to the Herald Sun. Schoolies could be banned from the Gold Coast or face fines if they misbehave during the week-long festival . More than 250 officers will maintain a highly visible patrol through streets and hotels during the week-long festival. Major Events Group Sen-Sgt Ben Nielsen told the Herald Sun that the new laws are an ‘extremely effective tool to remove troublemakers early and remove intoxicated people early.’ ‘If you’re from interstate and you get issued with one of those on your first night, effectively you’re not allowed back into the nightclub precinct for the duration of your stay,’ Sen-Sgt Nielsen said.

"The Liberal Democrats have been given one of their biggest donations in history, it emerged today. Former Cambridge professor George Watson, who once said he had disagreed with the party 'for decades, off and on', left £950,000 in his will. It was the single biggest donation to any party in the last three months, and is the second largest amount ever given to the Nick Clegg's Lib Dems. Nick Clegg's Liberal Democrats received a single donation worth £950,000 from a more Cambridge professor . Mr Clegg, who posed for selfie at the Skills Show at the NEC in Birmingham, saw £2.75million flow into Lib Dem coffers from July to September . The Electoral Commission today published details of all donations to political parties from July to September. The Tories received more than twice as much in donations as Labour in the third quarter of this year. The Conservative Party reported donations totalling £6.76 million, while Labour's total was £3.19 million. The Liberal Democrats reported £2.75 million, a third of which came from Professor Watson, who died last year aged 86. Professor Watson's £950,000 donation is the largest given to the Lib Dems since the £2.4million cheque from Michael Brown, who was later convicted of fraud. He once stood for the Liberal Party in 1959 in Cheltenham and was senior treasurer of the Cambridge University Liberal Club from 1978 to 1992. He was taught by Narnia novelist CS Lewis and went on to teach Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy author Douglas Adams. Writing in the Times Higher Education in 2010, he gave a withering assessment of the Lib Dems 'Parties do not exact obedience, and to join is not to share responsibility for what they do or propose. I have been disagreeing with mine for decades, off and on. Not that anybody noticed.' Lib Dem Cambridge MP Julian Huppert said: 'George Grimes Watson was a great thinker, an English don and a life-long liberal.' In total, 11 political parties registered in Great Britain reported accepting a total of £14,927,083 in donations between July 1 and September 30 . The Lib Dems also received £275,000 from Brompton Capital Limited, controlled by pizza entrepreneur Rumi Verjee. Today's figures show the Conservatives received sizeable gifts including £500,000 from Addison Lee founder John Griffin. There was also £300,000 from businessman and party co-treasurer Lord Farmer - who was awarded a peerage in September. Labour frontbencher Jonathan Ashworth, shadow Cabinet Office minister, said: 'David Cameron's Tories are the party for a privileged few. 'The Tory election campaign will be funded by those who dine exclusively at the Prime Minister's top table and a select few in the hedge fund industry. 'David Cameron's hedge fund backers and millionaires have been given tax breaks while hard-working families are struggling to make ends meet.' Labour accused David Cameron of relying on donations from welathy hedge funds, while the Tories said Ed Miliband was dependant on the trade unions for funding . Labour's biggest donation was £520,000 from the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers (Usdaw). Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps said 69 per cent of donations to Labour under Ed Miliband had come from unions. 'These figures show union bosses are deploying their chequebooks to shore up Ed Miliband's faltering leadership,' he said. 'Len McCluskey and his fellow trade union barons are propping him up, because they get to pick the Labour candidates, choose the leader, and buy the policies. 'Ed Miliband's weakness would have serious consequences for Britain. He is too weak to cut the deficit, and too weak to fix the welfare system. He would run up more debt than our children and grandchildren could ever hope to repay.'","Professor George Watson died last year and left money to the Lib Dems .

"Education Secretary Nicky Morgan has set out plans or schools to 'actively promote' fundamental British values, in the wake of concern some schools were being taken over by extremists . Nicky Morgan’s drive to promote British values in schools undermines Christian teaching and is potentially dangerous, divisive and undemocratic, the Church of England has warned. The Education Secretary was accused of adopting a ‘narrow’ set of values following the Trojan Horse scandal, ignoring Christian concepts such as ‘loving one’s neighbour’. The Church, which is responsible for teaching about one million English children, fears Mrs Morgan’s definition of Britishness could be used too narrowly to test whether individuals are ‘safe’ and ‘loyal’ citizens. It also criticised the use of Ofsted inspectors to ‘police’ the teaching of equality and diversity. The comments come in response to rules, drawn up by former education secretary Michael Gove, intended to prevent Muslim extremism in schools, following claims of a plot to take over governing bodies in Birmingham. Schools must ‘actively promote’ British values such as democracy, tolerance, mutual respect, individual liberty and the rule of law. But complaints have been made that, in efforts to prevent religious extremism, the rules are having ‘disturbing consequences’ for moderate faith schools. It emerged last month that a small Christian primary school in Reading was warned it could face closure for failing to invite imams and other religious leaders to take assemblies. Trinity Christian School was told by Ofsted it was not adequately ensuring the ‘spiritual, moral, social and cultural development’ of pupils. Its governors claim the school’s aims are being undermined and that it will be prevented in future from ‘teaching in accordance with our Christian foundation’. The Church has accused Mrs Morgan of giving herself and her successors ‘very wide powers’ and ‘closing down’ public debate. In what is likely to be seen as a reference to developments such as new gay marriage laws, it said rapid changes in society had been ‘unsettling’ for many. The Church’s chief education officer, the Rev Nigel Genders, warned against ‘rejecting all forms of religion from our schools’. The Church of England warns that government ministers should not decide what is included in British values, but should reflect the views and teachings of religious figures like the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby . He said, in an online essay this week, Church schools had never ‘been about indoctrination or recruitment’ but that extremism thrived if religion was ‘banished to dark corners’. ‘We wholeheartedly support the idea of schools being required to promote the values of tolerance and respect for those coming at things from a different perspective,’ Mr Genders wrote. ‘However, “British values” cannot be allowed to become a test … of whether somebody in a community is “safe” or “loyal”.’ He said changes in ‘equality and diversity’ in recent years remain ‘in many ways unresolved’ and some groups had found them ‘unsettling’. Mr Genders added that policing the changes with ‘an ever increasing inspection regime’ would not increase public confidence in them. In the Church’s response to the rules, it said the Coalition’s definition of British values was too narrow, ignoring Christian themes. ‘We are concerned that British values should emanate from a broad public conversation and not from the Secretary of State,’ the document warned. ‘By assuming the power to decide what reasonable or unreasonable behaviour is … [Mrs Morgan] would be taking very wide powers for herself and her successors and closing down the broader public debate.’ It described the ‘British values test’ as a ‘negative and divisive’ way define national identity.","Church of England criticised Department of Education over 'divisive' plans .

"You would never know by looking at the lively and cheeky toddler - now 16-months-old - that he was so close to death just seven months ago. But when Leo Lever was nine-months-old he swallowed a button battery in the family's inner-west Sydney home in April which had attached to his oesophagus for six days before finally being discovered on the third visit to the hospital. The little tacker had eroded an astounding one third of his oesophagus and had to spend eight days in an induced coma and a further six weeks being tube fed through his nose when he made a miraculous full recovery. Leo Lever was put into an induced coma for eight days with no certainty of full recovery . The nine-month-old swallowed a button battery which was discovered six days later on the third hospital visit . You would never know by looking at the lively and cheeky toddler - now 16-months-old - that was he so close to death just seven months ago . As soon as the x-ray revealed the round foreign object, his mother, Francesca Lever, immediately realised what had happened. Her husband, Stewart, had changed his bike helmet battery light and their eldest son, Lachie, 3, had climbed on to the bench and must have knocked it off onto the floor. 'Leo is a little vacuum cleaner,' his mother Francesca quipped who was unaware of what had happened at the time. 'He started crying out of the blue and was really distressed for the rest of the night,' she said. 'He was also vomiting but he was already unwell that week with a fever so I just thought it was part of that.' Francesca (pictured) believes her son's fighting spirit helped with his full recovery . Leo was tube fed for three weeks in the ward and another three weeks when he went home . It wasn't until Leo's breathing changed that his parents took him to hospital with staff treating him for croup on the first two visits. But when the little fella didn't improve, Francesca went back to the hospital and requested an x-ray and Leo was rushed into emergency surgery within 25 minutes. 'I still had no idea what was in store or how severe it was,' she recalls. 'It was a crazy time - I still can't believe we made it through.' Being so young, Leo needed to be sedated so he could remain still in order to heal and was therefore put into an induced coma for eight days. He then spent another three days in intensive care and a further three weeks in a ward before going home where he was tube fed at home for another three weeks. Sydney Children’s Hospital’s ear, nose and throat specialist, Ian Jacobson, told Francesca that he had no idea of the prognosis as it 'was the worst damage he had seen.' A third of Leo's oesophagus had eroded but it completely healed about two months later . His mother described Leo as a 'robust little guy' who was a 'loving, friendly and outgoing character' However, six weeks after leaving hospital, his follow-up procedure showed that his oesophagus had completely healed. 'The staff were amazed he survived six days with the battery inside him - one more day and it may have been different,' she said. Francesca believed that her son's character had a lot to do with the incredible recovery. 'He's a really robust little guy - nine out of 10 kids probably would have died but he has a real fight about him,' she said. ' He was jumping up and down on the bed 10 minutes before going into surgery.' She said she still finds it hard to believe that such a small object could have been lethal. 'I had no idea it was such a hazard,' she said. 'If it was a coin it would have obstructed and he would have choked - or it would have passed through - but because of the charge of the battery it attached itself to the oesophagus and started to erode.' 'It's good to spread the word because I didn't know such a tiny shiny thing could be such a danger.' Francesca still can't believe her family made it through the trauma .","Leo Lever was nine-months-old when he swallowed a button battery in the family's inner-west Sydney home in April .

"A tearful Catholic mother has apologised for her ‘lone wolf’ Muslim militant son who was arrested in New York when allegedly just one hour away from completing a homemade pipe bomb. Carmen Sosa, 56, mother of U.S. citizen Jose Pimentel, 27, who was born in the Dominican Republic and is a follower of late Muslim cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, said she is ‘disappointed’ with his actions. She said her son - arrested on Saturday at his apartment in Manhattan - started to change 10 years ago when he began reading the Koran and she brought him from his home upstate to the city. Scroll down for video . In court: U.S. citizen Jose Pimentel - who was born in the Dominican Republic and is a follower of late Muslim cleric Anwar al-Awlaki - was arrested on Saturday at his apartment Manhattan, New York . Plot: Suspect Jose Pimentel had constructed three pipe bombs, and planned to test them by placing them in mailboxes, NYPD commissioner Ray Kelly said . ‘I want to apologise to the city of . New York,’ she told the New York Post and the Daily News. ‘I'm . disappointed with what my son was doing. I want to thank the police - I . think they handled it well.’ 'I want to apologise to the city of New York. I'm disappointed with what my son was doing. I want to thank the police - I think they handled it well' Carmen Sosa . The Al Qaeda sympathiser allegedly . wanted to kill American soldiers returning from Afghanistan and Iraq and . had already shaved match heads and drilled holes in pipes when . he was arrested. ‘I love him - I . didn't raise him that way,' Mrs Sosa, who works with homeless people who are mentally ill, added. 'He changed. I cannot sleep... I don't know him. He dropped out of school. He's had a lot of jobs but . he's not working now.’ Pimentel had converted to Islam and . became a radical, authorities claimed. ‘We had to act quickly because he . was in fact putting this bomb together,’ New York Police Commissioner . Ray Kelly said. Saying sorry: Carmen Sosa, 56, mother of 27-year-old Pimentel, said she is 'disappointed' with his actions . Terror bust: New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg held a press conference Sunday night to announce the arrest of Jose Pimentel, who is seen in the photo on the right . Jose Pimentel, 27, is an American citizen and Islam convert originally from the Dominican Republic. He is believed to have been inspired by radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, and further influenced by his online terror magazine, Inspire. Pimentel spoke of changing his name to Osama Hussein in support of his two heroes, Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein. The NYPD counter-terrorism unit had been following him since May 2009, when he began speaking about violent jihad. Pimentel turned his talk into action after the death of Awlaki on September 30 and began building a bomb, NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly said. He faces several terrorism-related charges, including first-degree criminal possession of a weapon as a crime of terrorism. He admitted he ‘took active . steps to build the bomb, including shaving the match heads and drilling . holes in the pipes’ and was ‘one hour away from completing it’, court papers said. He was under surveillance since May . 2009 and considered New York police cars, a New Jersey police station . and U.S. post office among his potential targets, officials said. As a reader of the online magazine . ‘Inspire’ published by Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, he read . instructions in an article ‘How to Build a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your . Mom,’ Commissioner Kelly said. ‘We think an event that really set him . off was the elimination of Anwar al-Awlaki,’ Mr Kelly said. ‘His . actions became a lot more intense after September 30.’ A U.S. drone strike killed U.S. citizen Awlaki in Yemen in late September, ending a two-year hunt for . the man U.S. intelligence called the ‘chief of external operations’ for . al Qaeda's Yemen branch. Commissioner Kelly said Pimentel . ‘talked about changing his name to Osama Hussein to celebrate his heroes . Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein’. A police informant recorded meetings . with Pimentel over several months and accompanied him as he bought . materials for the bomb - including a drill and a clock, the criminal . complaint said. In court: A bearded, bespectacled Jose Pimentel, right, with his attorney Joseph Zablocki, wore a black T-shirt and black drawstring trousers and smiled at times during the proceeding . Since 9/11, New York City has . considered itself a prime target and has developed extensive . intelligence and counterterrorism divisions that employ 1,000 officers . within the police department. 'We had to act quickly because he was in fact putting this bomb together' NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly . No suspects have yet been convicted . under New York state anti-terrorism laws passed after the attacks. Pimentel, who has not been charged in federal court, faces life in . prison if convicted. At Pimentel's arraignment after the . press conference, his lawyer Joseph Zablocki said his behaviour leading . up to the arrest was not that of a conspirator trying to conceal some . violent scheme. 'I don't believe that this case is . nearly as strong as the people believe,’ he said. ‘He [Pimentel] has . this very public online profile... This is not the way you go about . committing a terrorist attack.' Bomb plot: NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly shows a replica of one of the bombs allegedly built by terror suspect Jose Pimentel at a press conference Sunday night . Damage: During a news conference Sunday night, Mayor Michael Bloomberg showed this video of the bomb's potential damage . Pimentel, also known as Muhammad . Yusuf, was denied bail and remained in custody. The bearded, . bespectacled man wore a t-shirt and drawstring trousers. He smiled at . times during the proceeding. 'This is just another example of New York City because we are an iconic city... this is a city that people would want to take away our freedoms gravitate to and focus on' New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg . Mayor Michael Bloomberg called the Pimentel case the 14th plot against the city since 2001. Most of these have been deemed . ‘aspirational.’ But some, such as the failed May 2010 attempt to set off . a bomb in Times Square, were closer to being carried out. Mayor Bloomberg said: 'This is just . another example of New York City because we are an iconic city... this . is a city that people would want to take away our freedoms gravitate to . and focus on.' Counterterrorism officials say ‘lone . wolf’ militants are of great concern because they can become radicalised . online and prepare for an attack without leaving traces that might draw . attention. Thwarted attack: The alleged plot in New York City was targeting the NYPD, government officials and soldiers returning from the battlefield . March 2003: Lyman Faris was taken into custody after police learned he was plotting to destroy New York’s iconic Brooklyn Bridge. August 2004: Dhiren Barot was arrested in the U.K. for his role in several terror plots in the U.S., including one that targeted the New York Stock Exchange. August 2004: Shahawar Matin Siraj was one of several suspects who plotted to place a bomb in the Herald Square subway station in midtown Manhattan. July 2006: Assem Hammoud was arrested and accused of conspiring with foreign militants to destroy train tunnels connecting New York City with New Jersey. June 2007: Authorities uncovered a plot by four men to blow up jet fuel supply tanks at John F. Kennedy International Airport. The ringleader of the gang was Russell Defreitas, an ex-JFK employee. May 2009: James Cromitie, David Williams, Onta Williams, and Laguerre Payen were arrested in a plot to blow up synagogues in New York City, as well as trying to buy missiles to shoot down planes. September 2009: Coffee cart operator Najibullah Zazi was arrested in an elaborate plot to attack the New York City subway system in a way similar to the London Underground attacks. May 2010: Naturalized U.S. citizen Faisal Shahzad tried to detonate an explosives-laden Jeep he parked in Times Square. Shahzad was later arrested at JFK Airport while trying to flee to Dubai. May 2011: Ahmed Ferhani of Algeria and Muhammad Mamdouh of Morocco were picked up by the NYPD after trying to buy assorted ammunition to attack a New York City synagogue. November 2011: Jose Pimentel is arrested in his New York City apartment in an attempted terror plot targeting the NYPD, government officials and U.S. troops returning from the Middle East.

"With a violent flash of teeth, this is the moment a wounded and starving jaguar tried to snatch a caiman from a Brazilian river in a last ditch effort to eat. But despite initiating the sneak attack, the cat slunk away empty-handed after the caiman successfully fought it off and swam to safety. The brutal fight to the death was spotted by a photographer, who watched the visibly unhealthy jaguar creep up on the caiman along the banks of the Piquiri River, Pantanal, in Brazil. Scroll down for video . The jaguar, which was visibly wounded and starving, bites down into the caiman in a desperate attempt to catch a meal . Chris Brunskill said the elderly female was first spotted hunting along the riverbank with visible wounds. He said: 'We found this old female Jaguar who was in very bad condition with several visible wounds on her stomach possibly caused by a fight with another Jaguar. 'She looked in desperate need of a meal and was actively hunting along the river bank when she grabbed this caiman right in front of my boat.' Unfortunately, the bold cat's plan went awry with the caiman successfully slipping from her hold and hurriedly disappearing underwater. Mr Brunskill added: 'There was a big splash and I took five pictures in about half a second, before the caiman escaped from her grasp and disappeared from view.' There are an estimated 4,000-7,000 jaguars in the Pantanal region, where they have evolved into specialist caiman killers and hunt during broad daylight. In recent years footage and photos have emerged of the predators launching sneak attacks on the caimans while they bask on riverbanks in the sun. However, in this instance, the cat actually jumped into the water to catch its prey - which is likely to show it was in desperate need of a meal. The jaguars found in the region are the largest and most powerful of the species in South America, enabling them to take down larger prey. They have also become a tourist attraction because they can be regularly seen in broad daylight. Elsewhere, jaguars are often hunted and tend to be shy and reclusive, making them much harder to see in the wild. With a flurry of violence, the jaguar launched itself from the shore and into the water, sinking its claws into the reptile's belly . The two animals wrestled for a few seconds as the jaguar tried to get a firm grip on its meal and drag it out of the water . Although the ambush at first looked to be successful, the attack was in vain - the caiman managed to break free and swim to safety .","Visibly starving jaguar attempted to ambush caiman by pouncing on it while it swam near the shore .

"Parents revealed their anger today over revelations that schools have been testing their children for sexually transmitted infections during lessons. Blatchington Mill School in Hove, East Sussex, is one of those giving pupils aged 15 or 16 the chance to do a chlamydia STI test as part of their personal, social, health and economic (PSHE) education. The scheme is part of a council-supported initiative offering Yeah 11 children chlamydia tests in school, to which nine secondary schools in Brighton and Hove have now signed up. Offer: Blatchington Mill School (pictured) in Hove, East Sussex, is giving pupils aged 15 or 16 the chance to do a chlamydia STI test as part of their personal, social, health and economic education . Backing: The scheme is part of a council-supported initiative offering children chlamydia tests in school, to which nine secondary schools in Brighton and Hove have now signed up. The council offices are pictured . Parents at Blatchington Mill were . shocked at not being told their children were being offered the test - . with one mother saying her Year 11 daughter refused because she ‘felt . uncomfortable with it’. She told the Brighton Argus newspaper: . ‘I didn’t know anything about it beforehand and I think the school . should have let us know as parents that our children were going to be . asked to do this. Defence: Ashley Harrold, deputy headteacher at Blatchington Mill, said the tests were part of an NHS strategy that had been running for about four years . ‘I . know the tests were done by the students in the toilets, but I think . it’s humiliating to ask teenagers in class to do a test for an STI.’ Ashley . Harrold, deputy headteacher at Blatchington Mill, told the local . newspaper that the tests were part of an NHS strategy that had been . running for about four years and involved other schools. The school said the lessons . aimed to give youngsters informed choices about their sex lives, and . normalising the STI test, adding that parents can withdraw their . children from sex education classes. A statement said: ‘As part of the session all learners are offered the opportunity (no one is made to do it) to do a chlamydia test during the lesson in an effort to normalise taking a chlamydia test. ‘It is not anticipated that a great number of these will return a positive result, it is more an exercise to demonstrate how easy and painless doing one is and to reinforce in their minds how and where they can do the test should they need to in the future. ‘Most young people do not become sexually active before the age of 16 and all sessions will be delivered within a framework of normative approaches, reminding young people that the legal age of consent for sexual activity in the UK is 16 and encouraging students to explore attitudes surrounding peer pressure, media influence and making positive decisions about relationships. ‘Research shows that this type of . provision does not encourage sexual activity. The sessions held for pupils at schools in East Sussex are part of the National Chlamydia Screening Programme, which was set up by the Department of Health in 2003. It aims to offer opportunistic testing to all young people between 15 and 24 years old, and to treat those who test positive for the STI. A school nurse can test someone under 16 for chlamydia without the knowledge of their parent or guardian as long as they understand the advice they have been given. Health professionals are also told to try to persuade the young person to tell their parents or guardians about the test. But patient confidentiality can be broken if the nurse discovers the child is at risk of harm. Other areas with schools that have tested pupils for chlamydia in the past include the Wirral in Merseyside and Redbridge in London. 'The purpose of this . programme is to support young people to start making healthy choices . around their health, understand what to expect from screening and help . them to engage with local health services, in a supportive environment.’ Brighton and Hove City Council said . the sessions were part of the National Chlamydia Screening Programme, in . partnership with the local NHS provider. Mr Harrold added: ‘It is an NHS strategy where, to demystify the test, they can have one to take away and try. We did receive a complaint from a parent and we take them very seriously.’ Meanwhile, parent Tina Daniels, 44, said she was also shocked when her daughter told her that STI tests had taken place at Patcham High School in the city. She said: ‘I am all for educating our youngsters on sex education issues and for some teenagers these clinics could be beneficial. But I think it's important for parents to be made aware that these facilities are available for their children.’ A Brighton and Hove City Council spokesman said: ‘Our work with schools in this area is entirely consistent with Government guidelines.’ Chlamydia is one of the most common STIs in Britain, with more than 200,000 people testing positive for it in 2012. Around two-thirds of people diagnosed with chlamydia were aged under 25.","Blatchington Mill School offering pupils chance to do chlamydia STI test .

"Lightning strikes in the United States could  increase by nearly 50 percent by the end of the century as the world gets warmer and wetter, a new study says. While those conditions were already known to promote thunderstorms in general, the new work focused on lightning strikes themselves. Researchers calculated just how much lightning flashes increase as air warms, clouds fill with more energy from water vapor and rainfall intensifies. A monsoon lightning storm strikes over Las Vegas, Nevada. Rising global temperatures may cause a big jolt in the number of lightning strikes in the United States over the rest of the 21st century in the latest example of extreme weather spawned by climate change, scientists say. The researchers based their calculation on 2011 weather data from across the U.S. The key is that warmer air holds more water vapor. Water vapor is fuel for thunderstorms, sparking more lightning. The energy that storms get from vapor is the biggest driver in increasing lightning strikes in the future, the researchers said. They concluded that for every degree Fahrenheit the world warms in the future, lightning strikes will go up nearly 7 percent. That's 12 percent for every degree Celsius. Because scientists forecast that the world may get about 7 degrees warmer (4 degrees Celsius) by the end of the century, based on current carbon dioxide emission trends, that comes to a 50 percent increase in lightning strikes, said David Romps. He's the atmospheric scientist at the University of California Berkeley who led the study. 'When you used to have two lightning strikes, now you'll have three,' Romps said. 'It's a substantial increase.' The researchers based their calculation on 2011 weather data from across the U.S. They presented their results in a paper released Thursday by the journal Science. Romps said the key is that warmer air holds more water vapor. Water vapor is fuel for thunderstorms, sparking more lightning. The energy that storms get from vapor is the biggest driver in increasing lightning strikes in the future, Romps said. The new study shows that at any given level of rainfall intensity, there will be more lightning in the future. Harold Brooks, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration severe storm meteorologist, said the study makes sense and marks an advance over previous work. The result is important mostly because it means more natural sparks for dangerous wildfires, which are already forecast to worsen with man-made warming, Romps, Brooks and other meteorologists said. This graphic shows the intensity of lightning flashes averaged over the year in the lower 48 states during 2011. Lightning strikes north of Macworth Island in Portland, Maine. A new study says flashes of lightning in the US will likely increase by nearly 50 percent by the end of the century because of global warming. Lightning deaths have been falling from about 100 per year in the 1960s and 1970s to 33 per year in the last decade. So far this year 25 people have been killed, NOAA data shows. Brooks said the drop is because of people changing their behavior to be safer in storms and better medical treatment of lightning victims. The top states for lightning deaths in the past decade are Florida, Texas, Colorado, Georgia, North Carolina and New Jersey. About 80 percent of lightning victims are male. Michael Mann, a Pennsylvania State University climate scientist, said this study 'is yet another reminder that there are likely some unwelcome surprises in store ... when it comes to the impacts of climate change.'","Researchers calculated just how much flashes increase as air warms .

"Researchers found regular meditation can relieve anxiety, pain and stress as well as traditional anti-depressants . Meditation for just half an hour can relieve depression as much as popping a pill, claim researchers. They found regular meditation could also relieve anxiety, pain and stress. In a U.S. study of previously published research involving 3,500 people, meditation alleviated symptoms of depression on a par with conventional anti-depressants. Meditation, which has a long history in Eastern traditions, is one of many 'mindfulness' techniques that have grown in popularity in the West over the last 30 years. It is typically practised for 30 to 40 minutes a day with the aim of encouraging acceptance of feelings and thoughts without judgment, and relaxing body and mind. Study leader Dr Madhav Goyal, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, said 'A lot of people have this idea that meditation means sitting down and doing nothing. 'But that's not true. Meditation is an active training of the mind to increase awareness, and different meditation programmes approach this in different ways.' He said thousands of people use meditation for stress busting and personal growth, 'but it's not a practice considered part of mainstream medical therapy for anything.' He said 'In our study, meditation appeared to provide as much relief from some anxiety and depression symptoms as what other studies have found from antidepressants. 'These patients did not typically have full-blown anxiety or depression.' Overall, depression affects one in 10 adults in the UK at any one time. There has been a big rise in the use of antidepressants in the last 20 years, particularly among women, with prescriptions in England reaching a record 50 million in 2012. NHS guidelines recommend talking therapies, including cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), in preference to drugs for people with mild to moderate depression. Studies show psychological therapies can be as effective as drugs in tackling common mental health problems, and are often more successful in the long term. The latest study focused on 47 clinical trials performed up until June 2013 among 3,515 participants that involved meditation and various mental and physical health issues, including depression, anxiety, stress, insomnia, substance use, diabetes, heart disease, cancer and chronic pain. Studies show psychological therapies can be as effective as drugs in tackling common mental health problems, and are often more successful in the long term . The researchers evaluated the degree to which those symptoms changed in people with a variety of medical conditions, although only a minority had been diagnosed with a mental illness. They found moderate evidence of improvement in symptoms of anxiety, depression and pain after participants underwent what was typically an eight-week training programme in mindfulness meditation. For example, the 'effect size' for the reduction in depression levels was 0.3, which is what would be expected from using an anti-depressant 'but without the associated toxicities'. There was some 'low' evidence of improvement in stress and quality of life, says a report in JAMA Internal Medicine (must credit). There was not enough information to determine whether other areas - positive mood, attention, substance use, eating habits, sleep and weight - could be improved by meditation. In the studies that followed participants for six months, the improvements typically continued. No harm came from meditation, said the researchers. Prof Goyal said there were weaknesses in the analysed trials and further studies are needed to clarify which outcomes are most affected by these meditation programmes, as well as whether doing more meditation would have greater benefits. However, he said, there was clear evidence that meditation was not simply a 'placebo effect' - whereby the patient experiences an improvement in symptoms without being actively treated simply because they expect to. 'Meditation programmes appear to have an effect above and beyond the placebo. 'Clinicians should be prepared to talk with their patients about the role that a meditation programme could have in addressing psychological stress. 'Stronger study designs are needed to determine the effects of meditation programmes in improving the positive dimensions of mental health and stress-related behaviour' he added.","Study found meditation works as well as conventional anti-depressants .

"These pictures make for an eerie throwback to a bygone era; all dusty red bricks, broken fibro walls, torn lino and worn wallpaper. It's akin to popping the top off an 1980s time capsule. They are the properties bought up in a frenzy almost 30 years ago, when federal government thoughts first turned to a second international airport for Sydney, in the far south-western rural suburb of Badgerys Creek. Now these once proud family homes stand idle, unloved and weather-beaten, in what resembles an urban ghost town, only playing host to itinerant rental residents, occasional squatters, brown snakes and marijuana growers. Scroll down for video . Dozens of properties snapped up in the 1980s now lie abandoned - in many cases, no more than piles of rubble. This one was gutted by fire just a few months back with the family renting the home 'lucky to escape' An abandoned swing-set adds to the post-apocalyptic scene in Badgerys Creek, one of the few signs that this property was once home to a family but its future, like many others in the rural suburb, is bleak with bulldozers to move in within months . Badgerys Creek has been earmarked as the site of Australia's next major international airport. Work is set to begin in 2016 after the issue was first flagged more than 50 years ago . Market gardeners in the Badgerys Creek area have all but given up hope. Here an empty wheelbarrow, dead plants and cucumbers are lying on the floor - an eerie abandoned greenhouse where the owners have been told they will need to vacate in a few months . Marijuana plants are dotted amongst the overgrown yards - while a rusty old sign gives glimpses of a forgotten community . Tins of food, coffee mugs and various foodstuffs are strewn across benches in now-empty kitchens . The need was first flagged in the 60s . Badgerys Creek, Wilton, Holsworthy and even Canberra have been mentioned as options . Badgerys Creek was nominated by the Hawke Government over Wilton in 1986 . The buy-up of homes across almost 2000 hectares would cost the government more than $170 million . A halt was put on the plan in the year 2000 by the then Howard Government . Tony Abbott this year announced it was on again and work is to begin in 2016 . The cost is expected to top $2.5 billion . Old toys, books and clothes litter the floors and the only sign of life is when a stray cow wanders up, hopeful for a feed. Dozens of properties were snapped up back then, perched across almost 2000 hectares of prime real estate; now those same places can boast only overgrown backyards, pseudo garbage tips, smashed doors and other relics from the past. There are the unpaid utility bills for the 'unknown owner' still stuffed in letter boxes and mature marijuana plants standing proudly amid the rubble. Other, more traditional plants from market gardeners' toils have been left to wither on the vine. The local primary school has just eight pupils and despite more than 100 years of history at Badgerys Creek Primary, it will close it doors at year's end. Work on the airport is expected to begin in 2016 after the commitment to build was made by Tony Abbott earlier this year. The cost is estimated to be upwards of $2.5 billion and the first flights could be operating within 10 years - some other sticking points have emerged. They include the pledge that there will be no curfews placed on airlines, which means around-the-clock operation of the new airport (unlike Mascot) and then the predicament of just who among Australia's most famous will be honoured with the name. Left behind: Remnants of fences, lengths of wire, a television and a stroller make up a collection of random relics in the town . Piles of old clothes, garbage and an Australian flag lie in a squalid kitchen shielded from the outside world by drawn blinds. Squatters have been making home inside some of the abandoned premises and locals say 'it's hard to know who's going in or out' Dozens of abandoned properties are strewn across the once thriving rural suburb of Badgerys Creek, which appears closer than ever than being Australia's next major airport site with work scheduled to begin in 2016 . Don't get too close: Patches of the community have been earmarked as 'Commonwealth Land'. Some residents have benefited through cheap rent but have been told to pack their bags . Welcome to Badgerys Creek: The urban ghost town only to plays host to itinerant rental residents, squatters and marijuana growers. Even the local primary school, with more than a century of history, is to close its doors . A road to nowhere: It's hard to picture today but Badgerys Creek is destined for much greater activity with the building of an international airport in these paddocks ... for now, parts of it, resembles a ghost town . Neighbours say some of the abandoned houses should be knocked down to 'stop people going in and out' Some places are inhabited, a few abandoned – but all share the same fate, at the mercy of a bulldozer's might, to be consigned to history . Those who've had the benefit of lower rent costs have been told to vacate by June next year . Locals tell the tale of one family's 'lucky escape' when their rental went up in flames a few months ago. This abode is now more ramshackle than renovator's delight. 'They should have knocked it down ages ago,' said neighbour Andrew. 'It's too hard to stop people going in and out of it even now.' Some places are inhabited, a few abandoned – but all share the same fate, at the mercy of a bulldozer's might, to be consigned to history. Those who've had the benefit of lower rent costs for the past decade have been told to vacate by June next year. Panels of wood and sheets of metal, reduced to nothing more than scraps, strewn among overgrown fields . Liverpool Councillor and WSROC President Tony Hadchiti says it's inevitable that an airport will go ahead in the eerily sparse suburb, many backyards now home to overgrown weeds and the odd animal . Letters to no-one: Many mailboxes are stuffed with piles of unread correspondence and unopened bills . The only sign of life is when a stray cow wanders up, hopeful for a feed . A Transformers poster and a broken front door ... evidence there has been an occupant but little else . Tony Hadchiti, president of the Western Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils (WSROC),said the old neighbourhood has to make way. 'For the first time in a long time we've seen that this (new airport) is going to happen,' he said. 'All signs are that it is full steam ahead and residents have been given their notices. 'It will be a shame to do all this work and kick the residents out if we don't eventually see an airport here.' Overgrown yards are a common site - complete with marijuana plant near the back door and with a decrepit boxing bag pictured hanging from a tree in the background . 'A lot of families will be affected by this but in fairness 30 years ago they knew that this was going to probably be a site for an airport so I suppose it's been that political football as to if and when it was going to happen, now it is,' Mr Hadchiti added. The Liverpool Councillor admitted a rundown neighbourhood was always on the cards. 'It is government owned land and obviously it does get neglected that little bit more than if it was owned by an individual who would come in and fix them up,' Mr Hadchiti said. 'It's ripe for people to come in and who knows what is happening in these backyards.' Rubbish and remnants of life lie strewn across paddocks . Toys and books lie on the floor - as if the residents of this house were forced to leave in a hurry without notice . Nothing but a rusty oil drum and a wire fence guard this property .","Dozens of properties were bought by the Federal Government back in the 80s in preparation for a second international airport in Sydney .

"Professor Anne Glover, pictured, claimed that opposition to genetically modified crops was a form of madness . Campaigners claimed a victory in their fight against genetically modified food last night after the EU scrapped the job of a controversial British scientist. Professor Anne Glover, who served as chief scientific adviser to the EU from 2012, had argued that opposition to GM crops is ‘a form of madness’. Groups worried about so-called ‘Frankenfoods’ wanted her position abolished, saying one adviser should not have so much influence on EU policy. The EU Commission confirmed last night that her position was being abolished along with the Bureau of European Policy Advisers under which it fell. The commission denied it had anything to do with her views on GM, but campaigners who had urged EU president Jean-Claude Juncker to scrap the role welcomed the decision. A number of groups wrote to the commission this summer saying Professor Glover, a former chief scientist for Scotland, had presented ‘one-sided, partial opinions in the debate on the use of genetically modified organisms in agriculture, repeatedly claiming that there was a scientific consensus about their safety’. Last night Liz O’Neill, of GM Freeze, one of the groups that wrote to the commission, said: ‘A single scientific viewpoint is a dangerous fallacy, so I very much hope that we can now look forward to a more widely informed dialogue.’ Dr Helen Wallace, of GeneWatch UK, said: ‘A single scientific adviser cannot possibly represent all the evidence and opinions relevant to the science policy debate. ‘There is a danger that chief scientific advisers become mere lobbyists for science funding, often in partnership with industry, and downplay scientific uncertainties and risks.’ Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace UK, said: ‘Scientific advice is the cornerstone of sound policy making. Campaigners hailed the scrapping of Prof Glover's important position at the heart of the EU Commission . ‘But the role of chief scientific adviser to the commission ended up hindering this process instead of helping it.’ While critics fear genetic modification of crops may pose ecological and health risks, farmers, scientists and multinational companies insist it is essential to boost agricultural productivity. Last night supporters accused anti-GM groups of ‘shooting the messenger’. The National Farmers’ Union said abolishing Professor Glover’s role ‘appears to be a backward step for science’. The European Commission said Mr Juncker believed in independent scientific advice but had not yet decided how to ‘institutionalise’ it. Professor Glover, who was chief scientist for Scotland before she moved to the EU, said last year: ‘I am 99.99 per cent certain from the scientific evidence that there are no health issues with food produced from GM crops. ‘Opposition to GM, and the benefits it can bring, is a form of madness I don’t understand.’ Scientific bodies accused anti-GM groups of ‘shooting the messenger’, and had pleaded with the EU not to pander to green campaigners’ demands. The National Farmers Union last night said the move was ‘deeply troubling’. It said in a statement: ‘This appears to be a backward step for science. At a time when we need to address serious concerns around food security, energy security and the collective EU response to the threat of climate change, it is deeply concerning that the voice of science should be stifled.’ Nick von Westenholz, CEO of the Crop Protection Association, added: ‘This is troubling at a time when scientific endeavour should have a more important role than ever in tackling many European policy issues, not least in response to the food security challenge.’ And Sir Paul Nurse, president of The Royal Society, said: ‘Scientific advice must be central to EU policy making, otherwise you run the risk of having important decisions being unduly influenced by those with mixed motives. Prof Colin Blakemore of the University of London, added: ‘It’s a sad day for science, policy, politics and the public in Europe.’ Julie Girling, Conservative MEP for South-West England, said: ‘I fear Mr Juncker has caved in to the green lobby.’ Professor Glover had been based within the Bureau of European Policy Advisers, which has now been scrapped. It will be replaced by the European Political Strategy Centre, which will give scientific advice to the commission but will not include a single scientific adviser .","Professor Anne Glover served as the chief scientific adviser to the EU .

Those pictured arriving at the event include Joan Kennedy, ex-wife of the late Senator Ted Kennedy, Bobby's mother Ethel Kennedy, Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey, the actress Julia Louis Dreyfus and her husband Brad Hall and Cheryl's Curb Your Enthusiasm co-star and creator Larry David. David was allegedly asked to give a toast at the reception, but awkwardly declined with 'lots of no's and hand movements'. Musicians Natasha Beningfield and Lyle Lovett reportedly played at the reception, where workers were asked to sign confidentiality agreements. EXCLUSIVE: A view from inside the compound of the tents on Saturday, taken from the porch . Getting started: Shortly . after 5pm, Hines appears in the doorway of the home, preceded by what appears to be her daughter Catherine (in blue and white skirt) and Bobby's daughter Kyra in a pink floor-length dress . Celebration: Cheryl Hines is seen hugging a guest under the wedding reception tent in Hyannis Port . The rainy Saturday afternoon nuptials happened despite rampant rumors of Bobby's infidelity. The wedding comes just weeks after MailOnline told how it was alleged that Bobby had a two-year affair with Connecticut socialite Chelsea Kirwan. This is the third marriage for Bobby, the son of the late senator Robert F. Kennedy and the nephew of President John F. Kennedy and the late Senator Edward Kennedy. The 60-year-old activist and his 48-year-old bride, best known for playing Larry David's wife on HBO hit Curb Your Enthusiasm and ABC comedy Suburgatory, have recently had an offer accepted on a $5million Malibu property - meaning Bobby may make the move to the West Coast. This is believed to be Bobby's way of showing his commitment to Cheryl following claims that he had cheated on her as he had on his previous wife. Hi there! Larry David, Cheryl Hines' co-star on HBO's Curb Your Enthusiasm offers a big wave to the camera. He reportedly declined the opportunity to give a toast at the reception .

On the right, Joan Kennedy, ex-wife of the late Ted Kennedy (Bobby's uncle), arrives at the family compound . Bobby could still be drawn into Chelsea Kirwan's bitter divorce from surgeon to the stars Laurence Kirwan as the mother-of-four faces a deposition and will likely be asked about her relationship with the Kennedy scion. On Monday, Kennedy and Hines were spotted at the John F. Kennedy Museum gift shop in Hyannis to buy gifts for the bridal party. And they have reserved a block of rooms at the Hyannis Harbor hotel for their guests. The hotel is a 500-room venue that lies on the ocean -and is booked out over this weekend. Bobby has previously been married to Ruth Black, the mother of his children Robert Kennedy III and Kathleen (known as Kick), from 1984 to 1994 and then Mary Richardson, between 1994 and 2012. Mary, with whom Bobby had children Conor, Kyra, William and Aiden, committed suicide at her Bedford, New York, home in May 2012. She was 52. In May 2010, Bobby filed for divorce from Mary after 16 years of marriage. Details of their divorce filing were kept private. The New York Post has revealed that the environmental lawyer and activist, who works for Pace University and Riverkeeper, had contact details for 43 suspected mistresses stored in his cell phone . It was reported he kept a list of dozens of women filed under the letter 'G' in his cell phone, including both Cheryl Hines and Chelsea Kirwan. Co-star: Actor Jeremy Sisto also attended the wedding with his daughter Charlie on Saturday. Sisto and Cheryl star together on the TV show Suburgatory . Some . of the wedding party members were spotted in at the Bluewater Grille in . downtown Hyannis Saturday afternoon during the rain. Pictured here are . Hines' friend Kevin Nealon and his wife Susan Yeagley . Actor Ed Begley Jr, a close friend of Kennedy's was spotted getting onto a shuttle in the rain . She is understood to have believed he had stored the names under 'G' because of the Italian slang for mistress - 'goomah'. This isn't the first time that details about RFK Jr's alleged philandering has emerged. A 2001 diary belonging to him surfaced last September which helped gave a stunning insight into the number of affairs he had carried out during the same year that wife Mary had given birth to their fourth child. Bobby used a section at the back of his diary, headed 'cash accounts,' to list the first names of women he had cavorted with and gave each a mark out of ten. The list contains the names of 37 women, 16 of whom have the number ten beside them - which is believed to have signified that they had full intercourse. Time and again he wrote of how he felt tortured by his 'lust demons' as he described them. On days when he didn't cheat, Bobby wrote 'victory' to signify that he had resisted sexual temptation. 'I'm like Adam and live in Eden, and I can have everything but the fruit. But the fruit is all I want,' he wrote on Nov. 5, 2001. The thick, red journal was found at one stage by his wife, Mary Richardson Kennedy and later found its way into the hands of the New York Post. When a Post reporter questioned Kennedy about the diary they were first met with a stunned silence before he denied having kept a diary during that year. 'I don't think there is any way you could have a diary or journal of mine from 2001,' said Kennedy. 'I don't have any comment on it. I have no diary from 2001.' The . area around the Kennedy compound was guarded by local police and . there were tight security procedures for anyone working the event .","The newlyweds went sailing Sunday with friends Ed Begley Jr and Kevin Nealon, along with Bobby's sister Kerry Kennedy .

"Lost and afraid, wandering aimlessly through nine miles of trails and hitting any one of 400 dead ends, the 911 calls of the baffled people stuck inside the world's largest corn maze have been released. Numerous times over the past six months, the Solano County Sheriff's Office has had to respond to calls from frantic visitors to the Cool Patch Pumpkins in Dixon, California, mostly in the dark to rescue people from the 60-acre maze. Indeed, the number of those getting lost inside the maze became so bad that the owners announced they would reduce the size next year to stop it swallowing paying customers whole. Scroll Down to Listen . Lost and scared: Worried visitors call 911 after getting caught in the The Cool Patch Pumpkins corn maze in California that spans a whopping 63 acres . 'I don't know what to do anymore. We've been in here like four hours,' one desperate caller says down the phone to the dispatcher. While another woman tells 911 that she has been inside the Cool Patch Pumpkins for hours with her two kids and would appreciate leaving. Another caller rang 911 and told them that he was concerned the maze would close and leave him overnight inside. 'We're stuck and they close at 10,' he said in a 911 call according to ABC News. 'We're very worried and we can't find a way out.' Deputy Daryl Snedeker of the Solano County Sheriff's Office said that he gets these calls every year. 'We have a good working relationship with the owner of the corn maze, so our dispatch finds him and he goes out and finds them,' said Snedeker. The Cool Patch Pumpkins corn maze in Dixon, near Sacramento California spanned 63 acres this year, 20 more acres than last year. They've even been named largest corn maze in the Guinness Book of World records. Open late: The maze stayed open until 8pm and frightened navigators of the maze made calls to the Solano County Sheriff's Department after sunset . The maze stayed open until 8pm, and NBC reports that frightened navigators of the maze made calls to the Solano County Sheriff's Department after sunset. Over the month that the maze was open, we got maybe seven calls, and in only three of those cases did the people actually call 911,' an officer told SF Gate. 'We tell them to relax and we put a call into the owner rather than send out a deputy.' Matt Cooley who has been running the maze for over 12 years and said that the 911 calls might be a sign that the labyrinth has become too large for people to explore. 'My brother, who designs the maze, always wants to make it bigger and better,' he said. 'But we might scale it back a little next year.' Despite the fact that maze explorers have been calling 911, this year has been quieter than others. In previous years people have passed out in the middle of the maze. 'In past years we’ve had people who have passed out in there,' he said. 'Nothing like that this year though — just a bunch of people who have gotten confused and called 911,' Cooley added. Cooley also told SF Gate that visitors are instructed not to call 911 but despite being warned, someone always gets frightened in the middle of the maze and makes the call. 'Sometimes you just know people will get out anyway so you let them figure it out, and sometimes we’ll get their number and talk them directly,' Cooley said. 'We’ve got guys who can navigate that thing in the dark,' Cooley added. 'So as a last resort, we’ll send in one of them to show them the way.'","Frantic 911 calls made by visitors to Cool Patch Pumpkins maze released .

"Have you ever booked that 'executive junior suite' at a hotel, only to arrive to find a broom cupboard with a view of an air conditioning unit? According to new research, 48 per cent of Britons have had to request to move after check-in when discovering the room is a far cry from what they saw on the website. Responding to poll results that suggest that one in five British travellers admit their holiday has been ruined by anxiety over whether to 'suffer in silence' or getting up the nerve to complain, Thistle Hotels have come up with a solution. Choose Your Own Room: Thistle hotel has launched a service allowing guests to select where they stay . The chain's Euston hotel in London has just launched a free 'Choose Your Own Room' online service. With 88 per cent of Britons saying they'd prefer to select what room they stay in,Thistle's solution to 'room anxiety' allows guests to take a 360° virtual tour of their selected room when booking. Much like pre-selecting your seat on a plane, travellers can view photographs of a specific room prior to checking in, including the view, and make a change if it doesn't meet their needs. On the brochure: Have you ever booked a room, expecting it to look like this... Reality: ... only to arrive to find this? Four in ten of those polled admit to feeling anxious about their hotel room before arriving, fearing it won't be what they paid for, while nearly a third have quietly requested to be given rooms away from work colleagues on business trips. The 'Choose Your Own Room' service aims to prevent any awkwardness for customers in such circumstances. David Grosfils, Chief Operating Officer from Thistle Hotels, says: ‘We know Brits hate to complain, so concerns about causing a fuss if we don’t like the room we’re allocated really can spoil a stay for many. Innovative: Thistle's London Euston hotel is allowing guests to preview specific rooms before booking . 'Guests often opt to stay in the same bedroom if they’ve stayed with us before, so we’re simply putting them in control by inviting guests who book direct on thistle.com to use the ‘Choose Your Own Room’ service. 'Our ambition is that all Thistle hotels across the UK will have the CYOR service and we are working on rolling this out now.’ 'Don't want to cause a fuss': With Brits known for avoiding complaints, the service prevents awkward conversations with reception staff . Behavioural Psychologist Jo Hemmings added: ‘Complaining really isn’t in our national psyche so the anticipation of not liking our room, or even worse, it not meeting our partner’s expectations really can make Britons feel anxious and out of control – particularly when they are outside familiar surroundings and away from home. 'Airlines have long put us in control before check in by letting us choose our own seats, so if we are staying the night somewhere, a system where travellers can really visualise where they’ll be waking up is a big move forward which should help combat first night nerves and help many relax into their trip without being worried about a row.’","Almost half of Britons have requested to move rooms .

"Chinese hackers recently broke into computers belonging to the U.S. weather service, it has been claimed, . The allegations come just two days after the American Postal Service admitted sensitive material belonging to customers and employees was stolen during a similar cyber attack earlier this year. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration confirmed that some of its websites had been compromised but declined to discuss who may have been responsible. NOAA, which includes the National Weather Service, is understood to have sealed off weather data relied upon for aviation and shipping after its cyber security team identified the breach. Hacked: NOAA, which includes the National Weather Service, is understood to have sealed off weather data relied upon for aviation and shipping after its cyber security team identified the breach . Cyberattacks were 'deflected,' and some NOAA services were taken down temporarily for what was described at the time as 'unscheduled maintenance,' according to American media reports. The Washington Post quoted US Representative Frank Wolf of Virginia, a Republican, as saying that the NOAA told him 'it was a hack and it was China.' The report came just two days after the US Postal Service said hackers stole sensitive personal information from its employees in a large data breach this year, and got some customer data as well. The postal service said it 'recently learned of a cybersecurity intrusion into some of our information systems' and was cooperating with law enforcement agencies in an investigation. It said the hackers appeared to have accessed 'identifiable information about employees, including names, dates of birth, social security numbers, addresses, beginning and end dates of employment, emergency contact information and other information.' Theft: On Monday the U.S. Postal Service admitted being the victim of a cyberattack and that information about its employees, including Social Security numbers, may have been compromised . A USPS spokesman said the breach affected as many as 800,000 people who are paid by the agency, including employees and private contractors. The statement said hackers also penetrated payment systems at post offices and online where customers pay for services. It said the customer data included 'names, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses and other information' but that there was 'no evidence that any customer credit card information from retail or online purchases' had been compromised. The Washington Post, citing unnamed sources, said Chinese hackers were suspected in the breach. The news comes with US President Barack Obama in China for high-level talks, amid heightened concerns about cyberattacks allegedly from China.","US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration confirmed the hack .

The center has successfully treated two other Ebola patients who contracted the virus in Liberia, one of the three West African countries worst hit by the largest outbreak in history, Omaha World-Herald reported. Dr Rick Sacra, who was delivering babies in Liberia, and NBC freelance cameraman Ashoka Mukpo were treated and have since been released from the hospital, which has the largest of just four biocontainment units in the country. There are currently no patients in the U.S. being treated for Ebola, after Doctors Without Borders worker Dr Craig Spencer was cured of the virus and released from Bellevue Hospital in New York on Tuesday. In a statement on Thursday, the Nebraska Medical Center said it had no official confirmation that it would be treating another patient.

Above, the surgeon's teenage son, Maada . Yesterday, Dr Sanjay Gupta said on CNN that Dr Salia was clearly in a stable enough condition to travel in. 'Just the simple act of transporting somebody from West Africa to the United States, the person's got to be medically stable enough as well,' Gupta said. 'So the fact that they're going to do that transport, that probably gives some idea of how he's doing overall in terms of stability.' The surgeon's transportation to the U.S. brings up questions as to what the Obama administration's policy is on paying for non-U.S. citizens' chartered flights back to America for treatment. Last month, Fox News obtained a State Department memo, developing plans to let non-American citizens into the country for Ebola treatment, but the agency initially said the allegations were false. This will be the third Ebola patient treated at the University of Nebraska. Missionary worker Dr Rick Sacra (left) and NBC cameraman Asoka Mukpo (right) were previously treated and released from the biocontainment unit . There are currently no Ebola patients being treated in the U.S. after Dr Craig Spencer (left) was released from Bellevue Hospital on Tuesday, Ebola free. The Doctors Without Borders worker contracted the disease after returning from work in Guinea. Pictured above on Tuesday with New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio . The 'sensitive but unclassified' memo advocates for a plan to let non-Americans into the country 'as long as they are otherwise eligible for medical evacuation from the Ebola affected countries and for entry into the United States'. The document goes on to say there's an 'obligation' to help non-citizen employees of U.S. agencies and U.S.-based private firms and that the U.S. should 'show leadership and act as we are asking others to act by admitting certain non-citizens into the country for medical treatment for Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) during the Ebola crisis.' The memo was met with backlash by some in Congress who believe the policy would leave the U.S. sensitive to further outbreaks. Already, two nurses have contracted the disease after treating a patient in the U.S. (nurses Nina Pham and Amber Vinson were subsequently cured. Their patient Thomas Eric Duncan, unfortunately died). Dr Kent Brantly  (left) and nurse Nancy Writebol (right) were the first aid workers to be evacuated from West Africa for Ebola treatment in the U.S. this year . 'This is simply a matter of common sense that if you are concerned about this problem spreading … we certainly shouldn't be bringing in the patients,' House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte said. The State Department, however, has denied the allegations that they are trying to bring non-U.S. citizens to the country and say they are only exploring the option of letting other countries use their specially-equipped planes. 'There are absolutely no plans to MEDEVAC non-Americans who become ill from West Africa to the United States,' an officials told Fox News. The surgeon is currently in Sierra Leone, one of the three hardest hit countries in the largest outbreak in history. Above, a health care worker from Sierra Leon's Red Cross Society Burial Team is sprayed with disinfectant after removing a corpse from a house in Freetown on November 12 . 'We have discussed allowing other countries to use our MEDEVAC capabilities to evacuate their own citizens to their home countries or third-countries, subject to reimbursement and availability. But we are not contemplating bringing them back to the U.S. for treatment. 'Allegations to the contrary are completely false'","Dr Martin Salia, 44, will be flown to University of Nebraska Medical Center, according to official in the federal government with knowledge of case .

"Facebook is buying mobile messaging service WhatsApp for up to $19 billion in cash and stock in the firms biggest ever acquisition. The world's biggest social networking company said that it is paying $12 billion in Facebook stock and $4 billion in cash for WhatsApp. In addition, the app's founders and employees will be granted $3 billion in restricted stock that will vest over four years after the deal closes. Boom: The free instant messaging service created in 2009 has grown faster than Facebook in its five years, and now has more than 450million monthly users around the world . Over 450 million people using the service each month . Firm has 50 employees . 70% of those people active on a given day; . Messaging volume approaching the entire global telecom SMS volume . Service adds more than 1 million new registered users per day . 600m photos uploaded each day . 200m voice messages sent each day . Facebook says it is keeping WhatsApp as a separate service, just as it did with Instagram, which it bought for about $715.3 million. 'The acquisition supports Facebook and WhatsApp's shared mission to bring more connectivity and utility to the world by delivering core internet services efficiently and affordably,' the social network said. WhatsApp has more than 450 million monthly active users. In comparison, Twitter had 241 million users at the end of 2014. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says WhatsApp is on path to reach a billion users. 'The combination of WhatsApp and Facebook will allow us to connect many more people round the world,' Zuckerberg said. 'We want to develop more mobile experiences like Instagram and Messenger. 'WhatApp fits this vision perfectly, it has incredibly strong engagement and growth.' 'It's the only app we've ever seen that has grown more quickly than Facebook itself.' 'Their product roadmap is very exciting and won't change. 'Overall, I'm very excited about this deal. 'WhatsApp had every option in the world, so I'm thrilled they chose us.' As part of the deal, WhatsApp co-founder and Chief Executive Jan Koum will join Facebook's board, and the social network will grant an additional $3 billion worth of restricted stock units to WhatsApp's founders, including Koum. Boost: WhatsApp is still growing and is predicted to have a billion users soon . The sale of WhatsApp to Facebook for $19 billion has made its founders Jan Koum and Brian Acton billionaires overnight. But they are not your typical Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. Success came to them late. The pair were well over 30 when they launched their messaging app in 2009. The duo stand out in Silicon Valley for their unusual approach. They both hate advertising and have paid for almost no marketing to make the five-year-old app a success. This may be because 37-year-old Koum and 42-year-old Acton had unusual backgrounds. Koum was born and raised in a small village outside of Kiev, Ukraine. Growing up, his home had no electricity or hot water. His parents, a housewife and a construction manager, avoided talking on the phone in case it was tapped by the state. Koum and his mother immigrated to Mountain View when he was 16. By 18, Koum had taught himself computer networking by buying manuals from a used book store and returning them when he’d finished. In 1997, Koum took a job at Yahoo sitting across a desk from Acton. They hit it off, because they enjoyed each others straight-down-the-line style. Michigan-born Acton studied engineering at the University of Central Florida and graduated in 1988. In May, 1992 he got a job at Rockwell International as systems administrator. Acton became Yahoo employee 44 in 1996, worked as software engineer, then senior software engineer, principal software engineer and director of engineering. The pair stayed with Yahoo for over a decade building their bond through games of ultimate frisbee.  In September 2007 Koum and Acton finally left Yahoo. They both applied to Facebook and were rejected. Instead they decided to set up their own venture, Whatsapp, now sold to Facebook for billions. According to reports, the success of Whatsapp hasn’t changed Koum or Acton. When a journalist visited the company's headquarters in July 2012, the Koum was barefoot and Acton was sporting flip-flops. 'This is an incredible moment for me,' Mr Koum said. 'Every day over 19bn messages are sent, with over 1m new users every day. 'We wanted it to be simple, and a better service than SMS.' 'We're excited and honoured to partner with Mark and Facebook as we continue to bring our product to more people around the world,' 'WhatsApp's extremely high user engagement and rapid growth are driven by the simple, powerful and instantaneous messaging capabilities we provide.' The deal instantly makes WhatsApp cofounders Jan Koum and Brian Acton billionaires. Forbes estimates that Koum held about a 45% stake in the company, while Acton’s stake was over 20%. Proud moment: Jan Koum, pictured at a digital conference in January, described the deal as 'incredible' Facebook promised to keep the WhatsApp brand and service, and pledged a $1 billion cash break-up fee were the deal to fall through. WhatsApp will remain based in Mountain View, Calif., and Facebook said its own messenger app and WhatsApp's core messaging product will continue to operate as separate applications . Shares in Facebook slid 5 percent to $64.70 after hours, from a close of $68.06 on the Nasdaq. Facebook was advised by Allen & Co, while WhatApp has enlisted Morgan Stanley for the deal. The deal is the latest aquisition for Facebook, which last year bought Instagram. It also reportedly offered to pay close to $3 billion or more to acquire messaging service Snapchat, though that offer was spurned by the site's founders. WhatsApp in numbers . Zuckerberg said WhatsApp would operate in the same way as Instagram, as a separate firm. 'It would be pretty stupid of us to interfere,' he said. He also said he was not planning to put ads on the service. 'Our strategy is to grow and connect people. 'Once we get to 2-3 billion people there are ways we can monetise. 'Now we want to focus on growing users. I don't think ads are the right way here.' Koum also pledged not to add ads to WhatsApp, which makes money from a subscription model. 'We think advertising is not the way to go - we create a direct relationship with customers,' said Koum. 'We want to make the product better, faster and more efficient.' Experts say the deal could help Facebook attract teens. Professor Will Stewart from the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) said: 'Obviously WhatsApp adds instant messaging to Facebook which must strengthen their position for the moment. 'Equally, all app types rise and fade, so established social media formats like Facebook will be overtaken by something new, and picking up candidates that might have ultimately replaced them may be a good survival strategy for a while. 'This does show the growing significance of mobile, though of course Facebook is on mobile anyway. 'But, Facebook has been around a while now so the real question is what comes next?'","Social network will pay $12 billion in Facebook stock and $4 billion in cash .

"The town of Cinderford, Gloucestershire, usually heralds the start of the festive season with an impressive display of lights. Flashing signs, shooting stars and illuminated snowmen are strung from lampposts in the town centre - bringing residents the first twinkles of Christmas. But this year the town has been forced to abandon its traditional display after being told it needed to spend £2,000 to make sure it passed the council's health and safety checks. Hard to see: This year the displays in Cinderford, Gloucestershire, have been replaced with fairy lights wrapped around lampposts . Traditional: The streets, seen here in 2005, are usually decorated with bright festive lights . Local councillors were told by Gloucester County Council they would have to stress-test each lamppost to prove they could safely bear the weight of the lights. But officials said that they could not afford to pay for the tests, which cost £60 per post. Instead they removed strips of LED lights from inside their stock of decorations and wrapped them around lampposts in the town - leaving residents with a display lacking in festive cheer. Mark Turner, who has lived in the town for almost 30 years, said: 'I was so shocked when I saw them. When it's dark they light up a little bit but otherwise they are not noticeable. 'They are extremely underwhelming. It's disappointing that the council didn't consult us first.' Mr Turner, who is standing as a prospective town councillor in the first by-election in 20 years, added: 'I was shocked when I saw the lights being put up on Sunday. Scrapped: Health and safety rules mean the town had to get rid of their cheerful designs, left, in favour of muted lights (right) 'I thought they were going to be in addition to the usual lights that we have, but then I was told that was it for Cinderford and no more would be going up. 'People have been walking past and just shaking their heads, it's just unbelievable. They are not very festive at all.' Former mayor Max Coburn, now a district councillor for Cinderford East, was surprised that Gloucestershire County Council had insisted on the stress testing. He said: 'They said these poles tend to rust easily so need to be tested, but I haven't seen any fall down yet. Festive spirit: In this photo taken in 2005, the town centre is brought to life with colourful Christmas lights . Proud: Residents mark the switching on of the Christmas lights in 2009 with a walk through the town . 'It will be a shame but we just can't afford it. With 30 poles it would have been very expensive to stress test each one. 'We will have to concentrate on the lights in and around the clock tower and triangle this year instead.' Town council clerk Lynda Thomas added that they plan to make up for the poor lighting with a better display in the town centre. She said: 'The council considered all options, but as the budget is set, there was no extra funding available. Christmas cheer: Residents are disappointed that the council have not put up the traditional display of lights . 'It was agreed to try this scheme for this year to see how effective it is, and to consider any changes when discussing the budget again in January.' Ken Pitt, street lighting manager at the Gloucestershire County Council, defended the decision to insist on stress testing. He said: 'Cinderford Town Council is more than welcome to install Christmas displays on street lights. 'However, last year we found that one of the street lights that a display was installed on was corroded. 'With the added weight of the decoration, this was extremely dangerous and could have caused a serious accident. 'Following last year's discovery, it's vital that we make sure all our street lights are safe to support any additional weight and we've been speaking to the town council for several months to arrange to test the lights they want to use.' Health and Safety Executive Chairwoman Judith Hackitt added: 'Here we go again, the season of Christmas health and safety myths is upon us. 'It is nonsense to suggest that lampposts need to be ""stress tested"" before fairy lights can be put up. 'One can only guess at the real reason behind this silly decision but it's not about health and safety.'","Cinderford, Gloucestershire is usually lit with eye-catching festive lights .

"A disgruntled resident has posted a hilarious rant on their neighbour's door, berating them for their angry lovemaking, 'primeval grunting' and 'Western Sydney' accent. In the passive aggressive missive, which is titled, 'To The Resident Of Apartment 12', the  writer even asks their amorous neighbour to bolt the bed to the floor in a bid to keep the noise down. The anonymous author lives in the Sydney suburb of Bondi which is saturated with hedonistic teenagers and backpackers, and the note was picked up by Reddit on Friday morning. Scroll down for video . Yours disgruntedly! Vexed neighbour in Bondi, Sydney, fires this hilarious missive to their neighbour begging them to bolt their bed to the floor and curb their 'very loud, very short yet very annoying' love-making sessions . After congratulating the recipient on their 'lustrous social life' and 'many friends, (many of whom are rather good looking) the secret scribe says they cannot stand 'what seems to happen of a Saturday night between the hours of 2-3am. And in a clear dig as the mystery lover's prowess, who they claim is called Nick, the fellow resident swipes, 'luckily for me Nick doesn't appear to last long, and for that I am thankful. 'I do not wish to pry in on your sex life, apartment 12,' they continue, 'however I do ask that before you mount Nick (or the rhino) I suggest you bolt the bed to the floor as so the rest of the beautiful residents here do not have to listen to your VERY loud, VERY short yet VERY annoying lovemaking sessions. The Sydney suburb Bondi is a mecca for students, backpackers and fun-seekers searching for sun, sand, sea... and booze . 'Let me give you a play by play,' they continue. 'As I am asleep, dreaming of playing the perfect game of golf, I near the 13th hole, when suddenly I am awoken by what I can only describe as sounding like a Rhinoceros attempting to demolish a wall, with a jackhammer, whilst high on meth...and cocaine.' The wordsmith continues, 'I do not know who Nick is or how much he weighs, I can only assume it is a lot due to the fact that on several occasions my bedroom slight begins to shake.'

And they admit, 'I can handle your annoying and slightly western suburbs sounding voice as you seem to proclaim your love for your hordes of booze filled guests,' and 'I can deal with the hordes of intoxicated foreigners screaming 'I love Bondi' in broken English as I eat dinner with my family'.

"Movies based on the Bible have always caused conundrums for directors as they balance creating a thrilling spectacle with sensitive issues of belief. The latest director to face this problem is Ridley Scott with his Biblical epic, Exodus: Gods and Kings, which opens in American theaters on December 12. Scott has opted to cast an 11-year-old British schoolboy, Isaac Andrews, to depict God through the character of a young boy Malak. Scroll down for video . Isaac Andrews, aged 11 and from the UK, was chosen by Ridley Scott to depict God in his new movie Exodus: Gods and Kings . The director told The Hollywood Reporter: 'Sacred texts give no specific depiction of God, so for centuries artists and filmmakers have had to choose their own visual depiction. 'Malak exudes innocence and purity, and those two qualities are extremely powerful.' The boy appears in the film when Moses is at the 'burning bush' and then later to guide the prophet who realizes that God is channeling through the child. The starring role in a multi-million dollar movie is far from Isaac's first big break. The 11-year-old's resume already includes roles in movies Hercules, Blackwood and British rom-com Having You. Scott's choice will likely add to the controversy surrounding the film, a month ahead of its release date. The film tells the story of Moses rising up in defiance against the Egyptian Pharaoh Ramses, setting 600,000 slaves on a journey of escape amid a series of plagues. Christian Bale, who plays Moses, caused upset last month after he described his character as 'barbaric' and 'schizophrenic' at a press conference. Speaking  in Los Angeles, Bale said he had undertaken significant research for the role in the Biblical epic, reading the Torah, the Koran and Jonathan Kirsch’s life of Moses. Christian Bale, who plays Moses in Exodus, courted controversy last month when he described the prophet as 'barbaric' and 'schizophrenic' The actor said: ‘I think the man was likely schizophrenic and was one of the most barbaric individuals that I ever read about in my life.' Bale also said he was surprised by the complexity of the Old Testament figure – and his creator. Isaac is already a star having had roles in Hercules and this British rom-com Having You . ‘He was a very troubled, tumultuous man and mercurial. But the biggest surprise was the nature of God. He was equally very mercurial,’ he said. Bale’s controversial comments haven't been well received by Christian writers  who fear the film is tampering too much with the original Biblical text. Influential Christian blogger, Brian Godawa, weighed in on Bale’s comments on his blog. Godawa wrote: 'Yes, Moses murdered a man, and he had a character arc that went from being adopted and raised as a pagan Egyptian to a conversion to his troubled and tumultuous faith. 'He had difficulty trusting Yahweh. He didn’t want to be God’s spokesman because he stuttered. And he even had arguments with God. 'But Schizophrenic? Barbaric? Really?' Godawa said that he hoped Bale's comment was ‘a reflection of the actor’s own ignorant bigotry than of the actual movie'. Exodus: Gods and Kings was filmed at Pinewood studios in the UK along with locations in the Canary Islands and Andalucia, Spain. The movie is one of two big-budget Biblical movies to be released in coming months along with Noah, directed by Darren Aronofsky and starring Russell Crowe.

"A puppy was left with a  permanently disfigured leg after his cruel owners ignored his injuries and refused to take him to the vet when he was hit by a car, a court heard. Bronson, a Lurcher, broke his leg after being struck by a vehicle while chasing a cat from his home in Sunderland. Despite the severity of the injury - owners Anthony Rickatson, 22, and Donna Krager, 32, simply covered the limb in a bandage. Suffered: Bronson the lurcher was left with a permanently bent leg after his cruel owners ignored his injuries when he was hit by a car, a court heard . Just weeks later Bronson was accidentally dropped as he was being passed over a fence by Krager's children. He landed on his injured leg which became dislocated at a sickening 45 degree angle. Rather than take Bronson to the vet, the owners took him to a third party who agreed to take him to the veterinary charity PDSA to get free treatment because they were on benefits. But this never happened and Bronson was forced to suffer weeks of pain. RSPCA inspector Helen Scott was later called to an address where the puppy had been staying for five days. The vet who examined the him said his owners must have realised he was in agony. Banned: The puppy's owners, Anthony Rickatson and Donna Krager, were disqualified from keeping animals for five years . Judith Curry, prosecuting, said: 'It was apparent that this dog's leg was broken. The leg was bent at the joint and was at a 45 degree angle from its body. 'He is with new owners now and has had a number of operations on his leg.' Krager and Rickatson admitted causing unnecessary suffering to Bronson between April 9 and July 9, under Section 4 of the Animal Welfare Act at Sunderland Magistrates Court. Further injury: Just three weeks after being hit by a car the dog was dropped on his broken leg while being passed over a park fence. He dislocated the injured limb at a 45 degree angle . The pair were disqualified from keeping animals for five years and will not be able to appeal the ban for four years. As a result they will lose the family cat. When the RSPCA turned up Krager and Rickatson signed the puppy over to the charity. Gavin Sword, mitigating, said Krager had previously owned a dog for 16 years which was well cared for, but had recently died of cancer. Mr Sword said the couple had not taken Bronson to the vet as they were waiting for their benefit payments, which were not due for more than a week. At Sunderland Magistrates Court (above) today, the couple were given six-month community orders with supervision and were told to pay a total of £800 in fines, victim surcharge and costs . He told the court: 'A reasonable person would not have done that. A reasonable person would have said 'this dog needs treatment right away'.' 'They are both very upset and devastated about what has happened. They are gratified to see from the other set of photos that the dog has made a recovery.' The couple were given six-month community orders with supervision and were told to pay a total of £800 in fines, victim surcharge and costs.","When Bronson broke his leg owners simply covered injury with a bandage .

"Under scrutiny: Ken Livingstone earned the money from personal appearances, speech making and hosting a radio show . Ken Livingstone used a loophole to avoid £50,000 in tax, despite having attacked tax avoiders in the past as ‘rich b******s.’ Companies House documents show that Labour’s London mayoral candidate earned £232,000 in 2009, the first year after his defeat to Boris Johnson. The money was earned from personal appearances, speech making and hosting a radio show. It was paid into a personal company set up by Mr Livingstone and Emma Beal, his then partner who is now his wife. The pair are sole shareholders in the company, Silveta Ltd. Accountants told the Sunday Telegraph that the move appears designed to ensure that Mr Livingstone paid corporation tax at 20 or 21 per cent, rather than income tax at up to 40 per cent. The move is entirely legal. Three years ago, Mr Livingstone . criticised tax avoiders, saying: ‘These rich b******s just don’t get it. No one should be allowed to vote in a British election, let alone sit . in Parliament, unless they pay their full share of tax.’ Accounts: The money was paid into a personal company set up by Mr Livingstone and Emma Beal, his then partner who is now his wife . A spokesman for Mr Livingstone denied he was a tax avoider. ‘No one can actually say Ken has done anything wrong - he pays his tax on his income,’ he said. Accusations: Tory MP Priti Patel accused Mr Livingstone of 'hypocrisy' ‘Since he has not held elected office Ken has had his own small business. As thousands of small businesses will tell you, the logical thing to do is to set up a company to handle all the issues. ‘That’s all he has done. He will wind up the company if he is elected.’ Tory MP Priti Patel accused Mr Livingstone of ‘hypocrisy’. She said: ‘This is another case of Ken Livingstone saying one thing while doing another. How can Londoners trust this man?’ Last night Mr Livingstone told BBC Radio 5’s Pienaar’s Politics show: ‘I’m not avoiding tax. Basically I pay income tax on what is paid for me to my daily expenses. I mean poor old Emma had to spend three years in our attic typing out my autobiography, booking my visits round the world to the mayors of all over the place and it’s a very demanding job. ‘But the other thing is, you know, I’ve used that to pay for other people to work on the campaign for Mayor and so on, and I don’t think that anyone really in Britain pays income tax on the money they use to employ other people to work for them.’","Companies House documents show that he earned £232,000 in 2009, paid into a personal account .

"Chilling surveillance footage allegedly shows suspected carjackers prowling a mall parking lot for targets just days before they shot dead a young lawyer in front of his wife. Dustin Friedland, 30, was gunned down at The Mall in Short Hills, New Jersey on December 15  last year by the four suspects, who fled the scene in his expensive Range Rover. His wife Jamie Schare Friedland, who witnessed the attack, filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the mall earlier this year, claiming they had reduced security ahead of the tragedy to increase profits.

Surveillance footage from December 15 shows the suspects driving up beside a parked SUV in one parking lot before leaving the area and heading over to the Friedlands' car. After the shooting, as the victim and his wife waited for an ambulance, cameras captured the suspects fleeing in two cars - their SUV and Dustin Friedland's. Loss: Dustin Friedland and his wife Jamie had just finished shopping when they were attacked in their car at the Mall on December 15 last year. Friedland, a lawyer, was targeted for his expensive car, police say . Escape: Footage shows the carjackers leaving in his car after the attack - without security following . Dumped: Friedman's Range Rover was recovered in Newark the morning after the attack last December . 'The surveillance videos are chilling,' Bruce Nagel, Mrs Friedland's lawyer, told ABC. 'On December the 12th, the same car with apparently the same individuals was apparently casing the mall. They actually had a dry run.' He called the footage taken on the night of the crime 'incredible'. 'You see both the perpetrators' vehicle and my clients' vehicle, speeding out of the mall,' he said. 'There is nobody there. There is no policeman to stop them.' He added that the surveillance footage  is 'a wakeup call' for the mall, which needs to reassure shoppers that they are safe. But he said it has not changed it ways since the tragedy last year. Nagel obtained the mall's surveillance footage just days after a judge denied its request to keep it to themselves. Suspects: Basim Henry, left, and Hanif Thompson, right, are facing murder and carjacking charges . 'Co-conspirators': Karif Ford, left, and Kevin Roberts, right, are facing the same charges for the 2013 death . Taubman Centers, which owns the mall, had said prospective criminals could use the footage to determine the location of surveillance cameras. But state Superior Court Judge James Rothschild Jr. declined to grant the order, saying it was a 'fairly unlikely scenario'. After the shooting, four men - Basim Henry, Hanif Thompson, Karif Ford and Kevin Roberts - were arrested and indicted on a list of charges, including murder and carjacking. They remain in jail and have all pleaded not guilty. They each face the possibility of life in prison if convicted. Mall lawyer Christopher McIntyre declined to discuss the case or the security, citing the ongoing litigation.

"Aussie blokes are renowned worldwide for their no-nonsense masculinity. But take another very close at that spunky bloke at the bar, because his new-found confidence may be thanks to his syringe-wielding cosmetic practitioner. As well as having his accountant, gym instructor, and barber on speed-dial it appears the modern-day Australian macho man is a closet metrosexual, suggested by the rise in injectable muscle relaxants like Botulinum toxin, otherwise known as Botox and its cousins Dysport and Xeomin. Louise Pring, Practice Manager for Heber Davis Skin Clinic in Ultimo, Sydney, says, 'Bro-tox is on the increase as men are no longer embarrassed about calling or coming into the clinic to find out how they can  improve their looks'. Before and after: Adrian Turner from Sydney turns to Botox to try and eradicate he deep-set wrinkles he inherited from his father . Smooth the frowns away: Heber Davis client Adrian Turner turned to 'Bro-tox' to eradicate his inherited lines . 'The number of male clients has definitely risen over the past few years and anti-wrinkle injections have become our most popular treatment for men, counting for about 20% of our clients,' she said. 'In the run-up to Christmas the figure is even higher because we offer lay-by, so we have a lot of younger men who usually couldn't afford it coming in.' When Heber Davis opened in 1988 its clients were 99% female, apart from men who were being treated for skin disorders. But because Botox is now widely spoken about and seen as acceptable - and celebrities like Simon Cowell and David Hasselhoff, have praised its effects - Ms Pring says the stigma has been removed. Smooth as a baby's bottom: Unlike his earlier days, Simon Cowell is a now a full member of the 'Bro-tox' club . The procedure takes just a few minutes so can be performed discreetly in a lunch hour, and because it can take up to two weeks for the drug to take effect, it's not a dramatic sudden change. 'Our male clients used to have treatments like laser for pigmentation or sun damage,' Ms Pring adds. 'But nowadays men, like their female counterparts, don't want to look their age, and are proactive about doing something about it. 'Often women who attend the clinic will bring the husband in for a treatment,' she continues, 'and although there are lots of male skincare products out there, muscle relaxants are more effective and provide a quick fix with no downtime. 1) To reduce gummy smiles . 2) Relaxing the corners of the mouth (sad lines) 3) Dimpled chin . 4) Excessive sweating . 5) Reducing pore size . When tradie Adrian Turner, 38, from Bondi, who has inherited lines across his forehead from his dad, noticed the wrinkles were getting deeper and beginning to age him, he turned to Heber Davis for help. Doctor Debora Davis had already cured Adrian's bruxism  (teeth grinding causing headache and jaw soreness) using muscle relaxants so because he knew the staff he didn't feel so awkward asking for the 'girly' procedure. 'I was  embarrassed as it's a bit girly,' he said. 'But the lines were making me look older than 38 and I was beginning to feel really self-conscious. My female friends said it stops more wrinkles forming so I bit the bullet and made the appointment. 'I panicked initially and began to regret it in case it was really obvious but two weeks later, my lines have reduced and softened and – most importantly – I still look like me,' he said. Fake it 'till you make it: Botox is the secret women for many women with clear, line-free complexions . 'If I looked like the Joker or worse my mates would never let me live it down,' he laughed. 'I've had a few people saying I look relaxed and asking if I've been on holiday but no one has twigged yet. 'I love the results and will definitely be having a top-up when it starts to wear off.' Dr Davis, who treats a number of celebrities, says that her male customers are from all walks of life, and reels off tradies, salesmen, doctors and media-executives as the majority. 'Men see Bro-tox as an investment in their career and their life as it boosts confidence and self-esteem,' she said. 'It helps them compete with the younger competition in the work place and dating arena - if you look good, you feel good and the new-found confidence helps you perform better in all spheres of life.' Injectables such as Botox is performed in just minutes by a registered doctor or nurse and has no downtime . In Australia the drug is always meant to be administered by a registered doctor or nurse. There are a number of pop-up style salons and chain clinics that offer special deals and discounts to lure new customers, so due to its affordability Louise says there are now a lot of younger people asking for treatments. 'The trick is to look younger and fresher,' Ms Pring added, 'not older and obvious. And if it also takes the focus off a receding hairline or bad teeth, why not?'","Men having muscle relaxant procedures such as Botox is on the rise .

"A mother learnt her partner had been crushed to death after his employment agency left a message on her answer phone checking she was okay. Father-of-one Richard Brown, 48, was killed as he unloaded pallets containing heavy kitchen worktops at an industrial estate. His partner Kim Tribe had been out Christmas shopping and was unaware of his death until she got home and picked up the message from a concerned member of staff at Prestige, the employment agency whose books he was on. Kim Tribe pictured with her partner Richard Brown, 48, who died in an industrial accident at Howdens Joinery in Wokington, Cumbria . 'The agency, which he worked for, wanted to know if they could be of any assistance after the tragic news about Richard,' said devastated Ms Tribe, aged 44. 'No one had told me about the accident. I rang Richard's mobile. It just rang out. I rang the agency back and they came straight round. 'They were mortified. They honestly thought I'd been told. I don't blame them. 'It has destroyed us. I'm still numb and in shock.' Cumbria Police and the Health and Safety Executive are carrying out a joint investigation into the industrial accident at Howdens Joinery depot in Workington, Cumbria. Mr Brown was making his second or third delivery on November 10, for the kitchen suppliers when the accident happened. The air ambulance along with a land ambulance, medical director, four fire engines the police responded to the 999 call at 1.30pm. A spokesman for North West Ambulance Service spokesman said Mr Brown was trapped under a number of pallets. 'Richard went off to work quite happy,' said Ms Tribe. 'He had been wearing his new work boots and hi-vis jacket. 'Workington was his second or third drop.' Ms Tribe said she had spoken, briefly, to her partner about an hour before the incident. 'Richard loved to talk on the phone,' said Ms Tribe from West Hull, East Yorkshire. Father-of-one Richard Brown, 48, was killed as he unloaded pallets containing heavy kitchen worktops at Howdens Joinery in Workington, Cumbria . 'He was always ringing people up. 'He told me, 'I'll unload this lot and I'll ring you back'.' Ms Tribe said she became worried when Mr Brown failed to call her back. 'I rang his mobile five times and left a message asking if he was OK,' she said. 'It was really unlike him not to ring back.' After learning of her partner's death the hairdresser had to break the news to his son, Dominik, 17, a former Hull City academy footballer. Mr Brown's nephew, Martin Oliver, 41, said his London-born uncle had not intended to work that shift. 'Richard was on nights, but agreed to do the agency a favour by working that shift,' he said. 'He shouldn't even have been in Workington.' 'Richard was a good man - very hardworking and likeable. Wherever you went, people would know him. 'But without doubt the biggest, most important thing in his life was Dominik. He loved him to pieces. The two of them could not have been closer. 'He was known by some people as 'Cockney' because he was from London originally,' said Mr Oliver. 'Everyone loved him.' A spokesman for Howdens Joinery said that the company had launched their own internal investigation into the incident.","Richard Brown, 48, was crushed as he was unloading kitchen worktops .

"In light of information that a fleet of Russian ships are on their way to Australian waters, Prime Minister Tony Abbott has downplayed the apparent show of strength. The move appears to be a show of force from Russia, whose leader Vladimir Putin met with Mr Abbott at the APEC leader's summit on Tuesday in Beijing. The pair discussed the MH17 tragedy and Abbott demanded an apology and compensation for the victims of the doomed flight from Putin, citing a similar case where the US took these actions after accidentally shooting down an aircraft. The prime minister said the journey had been planned for sometime, and while it was unusual, the move is not entirely unprecedented. 'Plainly it takes weeks, if not months, to deploy warships thousands of miles from your bases,' Mr Abbott said. Scroll down for video . Russian President Vladimir Putin (right) spoke with Prime Minister Tony Abbott (left) during their meeting at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Beijing on Tuesday . A fleet of Russian warships are reportedly on their way into Australian waters . 'So this Russian deployment into Pacific waters is something that has been a long, long time in preparation. 'It's not unusual for Russia to deploy naval elements when there are significant international events taking place. 'Certainly it is unusual for Russian naval elements to be in Australian waters. 'Unusual, not entirely unprecedented, but unusual.' Mr Abbott said the Russian navy also deployed to Singapore when the republic hosted an APEC conference, and in the Pacific when San Francisco when it hosted a major summit. The prime minister was in Myanmar for the East Asia Summit, where maritime security in the South China Sea was set to dominate discussions. Australia must also allow freedom of the seas, he said. 'If Australia, the United States and others expect, indeed demand, the right of passage for naval vessels in Asia, obviously we have to accept the right of passage for military or naval vessels in the Pacific,' he said. Meantime defence confirmed on Wednesday it was monitoring the four Russian naval ships in international waters in the Coral Sea. One aide got a front-row seat to the tension between Putin and Abbott in Beijing . Defence Force chief Mark Binskin has downplayed the strength of the Russian naval fleet. Asked why Russia was sending four ships to the international summit instead of the usual one or two, he indicated they weren't all warships. Russia had publicised its intent to deploy a task force to the South Pacific a while ago, and an ocean-going tug and an oiler are part of that group. 'So it's just one part of their operations. They're in international waters. They're allowed to do that. And we'll continue to surveil them,' he said. The news comes after the highly anticipated exchange between Mr Abbott and Mr Putin at this week's APEC summit. There were reportedly 'no harsh words' between the two leaders . The force could be in Australian waters outside of Brisbane by the weekend when the G20 summit will be held . The four Russian ships are near Bougainville in the Coral Sea . Among them is the Russian destroyer Marshal Shaposhnikov (pictured) While 'no harsh words' were exchanged during the 15-minute meeting, Russia rejected Mr Abbott's demand the Kremlin apologise for the downing of the passenger jet MH17 over Ukraine. The attack resulted in the deaths of 298 people, including 38 Australian citizens and residents, and is believed to have been carried out by separatists using Russia equipment. Asked if the ships were a show of force, Air Chief Marshal Binskin said: 'You'll have to ask the Russians.' The pair discussed the MH17 tragedy and Abbott demanded an apology and compensation for the victims . President Putin refused to apologise for the downing of the passenger jet MH17 over Ukraine . Putin waves during a tree-planting ceremony at the APEC summit in Beijing . CEO of Intelligent Risks Neil Fergus said on the Today Show that while it is a show of strength there is 'not necessarily anything wrong because the fleet will stay out in international waters and doesn't need permission'. 'Putin has organised fleets in recent years when he goes to these summits,' Mr Fergus added, as he explained Putin's father was in the navy so there are strong family ties. Australian ships HMAS Parramatta and HMAS Stuart have been sent to monitor the fleet. A P3 Orion Surveillance Aircraft has also been deployed to the area to monitor the ships along with an Anzac class frigate, Seven News reported. Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Russian President Vladimir Putin posed for an official photo with other leaders at the APEC summit on Monday . Despite standing just behind the Russian leader, Abbott avoided confrontation with Mr Putin... but he still stared daggers in the back of his head . Vladimir Putin meets with a student during his visit to the Far Eastern Federal University in Vladivostok . Mr Putin was in Vladivostok for a two-day tour prior to the G20 summit . Mr Putin and Mr Abbott will have further discussions in Brisbane . When Australian ships reach the Russian fleet Mr Fergus said there will be some 'polite engagement and navy discourse'. But he stressed 'there should be no alarm about diplomacy happening on the high seas'. It's not the first time Russian naval vessels have been present while an international summit is on. Russian warships were around for an APEC meeting in Singapore in 2009 as well as former Russian president Dimitri Medvedev's visit to San Francisco in 2010. Defence is directing further questions regarding the vessels to Russian authorities. Mr Abbott poses for another awkward family photo at the East Asian Summit in Myanmar .

Everyone, link hands! Mr Obama, Mr Razak, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, and Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung pose for a group photo . Abbott reportedly knew of a developing security threat to Australia when he left China earlier on Wednesday. Putin is said to have ordered the fleet, and it has been instructed to 'show the flag' on Saturday morning, The Daily Telegraph reported. A senior government source told The Daily Telegraph the intentions of the Russian leader were obvious. 'There is no doubt this is posturing, to show the power of the Russia fleet,' the source said. While still south of Bougainville in the Coral Sea, the force could be outside of Brisbane by the weekend when the G20 summit will be held. Leaders, including Barack Obama, Japanese PM Shinzo Abe, Tony Abbott, Malaysian PM Najib Razak and  China president Xi Jinping posed for more family photos before leaving for the G20 .

Mr Obama boards Air Force One in Beijing to head to the G20 summit, where he will stay in the presidential suite at the Marriott Hotel . Officers are already stationed outside gates and entrances at the Brisbane Exhibition and Convention Centre . Defence said the movement of the Russian vessels is consistent with provisions under international law, allowing military vessels to exercise freedom of navigation in international waters. At this point Russia has made no request to port in Australia, and if they wished to do so would have to provide at least 48 hours notice. The fleet is reportedly led by a guided missile cruiser ahead of destroyer Marshal Shaposhnikov. Tug boat Fotiy Krylov and supply tanker Boris Butoma round out the second half of the group.

"For years scientists have worked to find a way to make it easier for deaf and hearing impaired people to communicate. And now it is hoped that a new intelligent system could be about to transform their lives. Researchers have used image recognition to translate sign language into ‘readable language’ and while it is early days, the tool could one day be used on smartphones. Researchers have used image recognition to translate sign language (pictured) into 'readable language' and while it is early days, the tool could one day be used on smartphones . Scientists from Malaysia and New Zealand came up with the Automatic Sign Language Translator (ASLT), which can capture, interpret and translate sign language. It has been tested on gestures and signs representing both isolated words and continuous sentences in Malaysian sign language, with what they claim is a high degree of recognition accuracy and speed. Its creators say that it has the potential for use in multiple languages. The tool uses image processing and pattern recognition to translate actions into words. Life could get a little easier for visually impaired people too as scientists from Georgia Tech have created vibrating gloves (pictured) which have help people learn to read Braille more easily . Vibrating gloves have been designed that help people learn to read Braille more easily. Scientists at Georgia Tech placed vibrating motors at the knuckle of each finger in the gloves. When one of the motors vibrates, the wearer presses a corresponding key and the system tells them which letter they are typing. The gloves were tested on people who had never learned Braille before. They were then distracted for 30 minutes by playing a game and half of the participants' gloves kept buzzing so they kept learning passively. People wearing the gloves that kept buzzing made 30 per cent less errors than those who did not benefit from the passive haptic training. They could read 70 per cent of a Braille phrase when tested, compared to those whose training stopped during the game, who could only read 22 per cent. ‘At the heart of the ASLT are real-time image processing and computational intelligence methods,’ said researcher Professor Rini Akmeliawati, of Malaysia’s IIUM University. ‘We developed a novel approach, leading to efficient detection and tracking of face, hands and upper body trajectories of a signer. ‘By combining it with our tools for artificial intelligence-based matching between these sign trajectories and elements of a large database of images and video recordings of native signers, we have achieved a fast and flexible automatic sign language translation system. ‘The system’s potential lies in its technologically advanced algorithms and structure, which can be adapted to a multitude of the world’s sign languages.’ Everyday communication is a major challenge to a great many hearing-impaired people, as well as those unable to speak, all around the world. Until now, systems devised to remove these barriers to communication have had limited capabilities in terms of target languages or ease of use. According to the study in the Institution of Engineering and Technology’s (IET) The Journal of Engineering, the early stage technology could be economical enough for mass production and for use on mobile devices. The scientists believe that their creation will result in a portable, efficient and affordable ASLT for a wide variety of sign and written languages.","Researchers from Malaysia and New Zealand have used image recognition to translate sign language into ‘readable language’

"Independent Muslim schools in London are being investigated amid fears  that hardline Islamic extremism is being promoted among pupils and staff, . As many as a dozen private schools in Tower Hamlets, east London, are being looked into by officials over reports that fundamentalism is being spread, MailOnline can reveal. A Whitehall source said while investigations are in 'their very early stages', there is concern within the Department of Education over a number of fee-paying Muslim schools in the borough which has one of the strongest Muslim communities in the capital. At least a dozen independent Muslim schools in Tower Hamlets, east London (pictured), are facing investigations into claims Islamic extremists are pushing their hardline views through the classroom . Unlike the 'Trojan Horse' scandal which saw secular schools in Birmingham being infiltrated by extremists, the affected institutions in Tower Hamlets are all thought to be Muslim. Five schools were placed in special measures in Birmingham earlier this year after evidence suggested the views of Islamic extremists were being pushed upon pupils and staff. The Department of Education would not confirm whether  Tower Hamlets was specifically at risk, but said it would consider 'any evidence' brought forward. 'All schools are subject to a tough inspection regime and we have been clear we will not hesitate to take firm and swift action if pupils are being let down or placed at risk. 'Keeping our children safe, and ensuring our schools prepare them for life in modern Britain, could not be more important.' Yummy Yummy, a sweet shop in Tower Hamlets, was searched as part of an ongoing police investigation into terrorism offences earlier this week . Earlier this week an address in the area was searched as part of an ongoing police effort to crack down on terror. Eleven men were arrested across the capital and in Stoke-on-Trent as part of the Scotland Yard effort. It comes as Ofsted prepares to publish the findings of 40 snap inspections across the country, launched amid concerns that some schools were not offering a broad enough curriculum. Jewish, Christian and Islamic schools were among those visited in Luton, Bradford, London and Manchester . Former terror chief Peter Clarke told ministers earlier this month it was likely allegations of extremist infiltration at the schools involved in the Trojan Horse scandal could be applied to other institutions across the country. Tower Hamlets is the only local authority in London where Muslims account for the largest single religious group. An estimated 35 per cent of the population practise Islam, compared with 4.4 per cent across the country according to the 2011 census. Almost half of all residents are aged between 20 and 39. In July, its mayor Lutfur Rahman sparked controversy by calling for the Palestinian flag to be flown above the town hall in a show of support Gaza. Jewish groups condemned the move as 'destructive'. Last month a black and white flag, similar to the kind brandished by ISIS, was taken down from the entrance of a housing estate in Tower Hamlets by a nun. Sister Christine Frost removed it as she feared it would incite aggression. This week a sweet shop called Yummy Yummy was searched as part of an anti-terror operation by Metropolitan Police. Eleven men were arrested as a result of the city-wide effort. Golden Hillock School, Nansen Primary School, Park View School, Oldknow Academy and Saltley School - which are all run by the Park View Educational Trust - were placed in special measures following complaints. Giving evidence to the Commons education select committee, he said it was incumbent on the government to investigate the situation. 'I'm not a great believer in coincidence and I would find it very surprising if this was only happening in the few schools that we had the time and opportunity to look at in east Birmingham,' Mr Clarke told the cross-party group of MPs. 'Some of the people who were involved in promulgating these techniques of gaining control and influence in schools have had national roles in various educational bodies and I know have lectured and taken part in conferences in other cities.' Earlier this month an inquiry into the Birmingham school  heard a 'violent, extremist' video was shown in the classroom. Ian Kershaw, a former head teacher, told the Birmingham City Council that examples of 'bad behaviour' in the school included the film, which was 'completely inappropriate to young people'. He described this film as a 'violent, extremist video', and when committee chairman Graham Stuart asked if it was 'jihadist, violent, extremist promotional video', Mr Kershaw indicated that it was.","Schools in Tower Hamlets, east London, are among alleged extremist hubs .

"Leicester GP Michael Summer under declared his earnings for four years, avoiding £185,000 in Tax . A doctor lied about his salary to dodge paying £185,000 in tax and live the luxury life he had become accustomed to - sending his children to private school and going on expensive holidays. Dr Michael Summer, 46, earned more than £750,000 yet paid tax and national insurance on only half that amount. One year the GP only declared a quarter of his earnings - avoiding thousands in tax which he spent on renovations to his £400,000 home in Leicester and overseas holidays. He also used the money to take his family to China where he was born, and buy several expensive cars including a BMW 5 Series and a £50,000 Maserati. A judge said the talented doctor had 'brought the tragedy on himself' and his family by under declaring his income - in one instance by as much as £200,000. The fraud took place between 2008 and 2012. When his evasion was exposed he tried to tell inspectors from HM Revenue and Customs that he 'wasn't good with numbers.' Summer managed to build up his salary by working as a self employed medical practitioner and also carried out examinations on members of the armed forces. Leicester Crown Court heard that the GP had previously been awarded £500,000 after he was injured in a motorbike accident. He had apparently got used to living the lifestyle that this payout afforded, the court was told. Summer admitted four counts of fraudulent evasion of income tax by grossly under declaring his salary. He was jailed for 18 months for each offence, to run concurrently. Judge Nicholas Dean QC said he felt Summer knew what he had been doing, but he said he hoped the GP would be able to continue working as a doctor once he was released from prison. 'This is in many ways a tragic case, but you've brought tragedy upon yourself and your family,' said Judge Dean. 'Self-employment and an increased income led to you significantly under-declaring your income, which resulted in you paying significantly less income tax and national insurance than were due. 'Between 2008 and 2009 your under-declaration of income was quite modest, but it snowballed and by the final count you failed to declare income approaching £200,000. 'The total unpaid income tax and national insurance was £185,000 and that's a very considerable and serious fraud. 'I take the view you knew what you were doing. 'Having become used to a high income and spending considerable amounts of money, you continued and it may be that tempted you to under-declare your income. 'You knew perfectly well the true figures were substantially higher. 'There's also a great deal of good to be said about you, you're a doctor and have devoted your professional life to others and that's important. Dr Summers downsized to a £400,000 home in Ratby in Leicester with his wife after his fraud was exposed . 'It doesn't seem these offences touch upon your professionalism as a doctor and it's hoped you will be able to work again as a doctor in future.' The court heard that Summer was earning a six figure salary in 2009 as a self employed medical practitioner, doing  examinations for solicitors and insurance companies for personal injury assessments. He had previously worked as a locum. Elizabeth Power, prosecuting, told the court Summer earned £254,533 in the tax year 2011 and 2012 but only declared earnings of £59,221. For the 2008-2009 tax period he declared earnings of £36,791 instead of £48,563. In 2010 he declared £48,429 instead of £152,660, and in 2011 he declared £50,188 instead of £152,651. He had lived in the affluent Houghton on the Hill district in Leicester, and drove luxury cars, but he has since downsized to a £415,000 home in Ratby, with his wife Ann Elizabeth, 40. Helen Johnson, defending, said he became used to an 'expensive lifestyle' and his paperwork was 'in disarray' when he submitted his tax returns. Some of the money was used to renovate the kitchen at his previous home. In interview, Summer told police: 'There were so many things happening... that I just kept pushing it back and I said 'okay, I'll do it properly next time'.' The court heard £100,000 has already been paid back and a proceeds of crime hearing is planned to take place next year. After the case, an HMRC spokesperson said: 'Suppressing your true income to reduce your tax bill will not be tolerated by HMRC or the public. 'Michael Summer spent vast sums on a luxury lifestyle, on his home, his holidays and even his car. 'We will not cease in our efforts to track down those who deliberately, and fraudulently, seek to gain a financial advantage over honest businesses. 'If Summer had come forward in 2010 and used the voluntary disclosure campaign to put his affairs in order, it would have been much less costly for him.' In 2010, HMRC launched a campaign encouraging doctors and other medical professionals to declare their unpaid tax. To date the campaign has raised total revenue of more than £64million.","Dr Michael Summer only declared a fraction of his earnings to HMRC .

"Harold Morgan, 85, was given a send off to remember today after a social media appeal for mourners to attend his funeral went viral . Hundreds of mourners turned out to pay their respects at the funeral of a former soldier following a Facebook appeal after he died alone. Former Welsh Guardsman Harold Morgan, 85, was given a send off to remember with long lost friends, relatives and total strangers packing out St. Tathan Church in the Vale of Glamorgan, South Wales. The church had feared they would struggle to fill a single row of pews for the funeral of Mr Morgan - who had lived in a care home in Barry for the past 14 years. The former railwayman died with little known about his family and officials said it would be 'horrible' if no-one attended his send-off. So the Reverend Rachel Simpson, the curate who led the service, posted a message on the church's Facebook page on Monday which was quickly shared by others. Also at today's service were representatives from the fire service, police and Royal British Legion as well as youngsters from a military college. The funeral was so well attended that there were no spare seats inside the 14th century church - and speakers had to be set up so mourners standing outside in the rain could hear the service. Reverend Rachel Simpson said she had been worried she would be addressing a virtually empty church for the service. She said: 'Two days ago, Harold was known and loved by only a small few and by god. 'But there was an amazing response - bringing people here to pay their last respects even though they didn't know him.' Mourners filled every row at today's service at St. Tathan Church in the Vale of Glamorgan, South Wales . Mr Morgan, the eldest of five children, was born in Barnsley in 1929. At the age of 17, he left school and joined the Welsh Guards for five years and was posted to Palestine during a 'time of deep turmoil' in the region. Reverend Simpson added: 'It wasn't a happy time for him, but like the reserved gentleman he was, he kept his views to himself.' But one memorable moment from his time there was when the Yorkshireman - whose family were originally from Wales - played a game of rugby in the sand while wearing military boots. Reverend Rachel Simpson had been worried that the church would be empty for the fineral . After returning home, he was discharged from the Army on medical grounds and moved to Reading, where he became a signalman in 1955. When his year long-marriage ended, he moved to Carmarthen, where he later worked as a carpenter and then a book-keeper. While in Wales, the massive train enthusiast co-founded the Welsh Railyway Research Circle and in 1984 saw his book, South Wales Branch Lines, published. Reverend Simspon added: 'The circle now has more than 500 members - which is testament to his dedication. Also at today's service were representatives from the fire service, police and Royal British Legion as well as youngsters from a military college . Although described as a 'very private person', Mr Morgan was renowned for having a wicked sense of humour and always finding the lighter side of life in every situation . 'He was very well respected among his peers.' Although described as a 'very private person', Mr Morgan was renowned for having a wicked sense of humour and always finding the lighter side of life in every situation. He later lived in St Athan, but moved to College Fields Nursing Home in Barry after suffering a stroke. Reverend Simpson told the congregation: 'On November 2, his health problems got the better of him and, in his own words, 'the chief foreman above signalled the closing of his regulator'. 'He departed to that great marshalling yard in the sky.' The service featured a battalion bugler playing the Last Post with two standard bearers in uniform displaying regimental flags . Forces veteran Tony Evans, 67, decided to attend the service after hearing about the story on the news. He said: 'We are a family regiment so once you're a member, you're always a member.' Charlotte Jenkins, of St Athan, said she felt it was important to be there too. The 29-year-old, who stood outside with her ten-month-old daughter, said: 'I work with the elderly so I thought it was important for people in the community to give thanks for this man because he was in the forces.' The small church in south Wales was so busy today that some mourners had to stand outside in the rain . Also in attendance were 30 students from the Military Preparation College in Cardiff . Also in attendance were 30 students from the Military Preparation College in Cardiff. Senior director Brian Edwards said: 'This week has all been about remembering those who gave their lives for their country. 'So we were determined to support the church's appeal.'

"Unmanned spy drones could patrol Britain’s shores looking for illegal immigrants and smugglers after a series of high-level meetings in Brussels, The Mail on Sunday has learned. The European Commission aims to spend £260 million on its ‘Eurosur’ project, which includes a plan for surveillance drones to patrol the Mediterranean coast. At the same time, several schemes are under way in Britain, aiming to develop civilian roles for aircraft based on the killer drones hunting Al Qaeda terrorists in Afghanistan and Pakistan. All-seeing: Surveillance planes with military-grade cameras would be more effective at monitoring the coastline than satellites or standard planes . If the high-tech measures against . terrorists, illegal immigrants and smugglers in the Mediterranean are . successful, there would be pressure on the UK to follow suit. Surveillance . planes with military-grade cameras would be more effective at . monitoring the coastline than satellites or standard planes. British . defence firms are testing sophisticated ‘sense and avoid’  systems on . unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) over the Irish Sea and some experts . believe European civilian airspace could soon see drones flying . alongside other aircraft. Meanwhile . Kent Police are working on a £3 million project with  partners in the . UK, France and the Netherlands to explore the use of unmanned aircraft . to patrol its coastline and the English Channel. A spokesman said the likely targets would include ‘organised criminals, such as people-smugglers’. Eurosur, which is about to go before . the European Parliament, involves small drones being deployed along the . Mediterranean coastline, and is a response to the large numbers of . illegal immigrants crossing from North Africa in small boats. The . umbrella body for EC border agencies, Frontex, which came up with the . idea, has hosted demonstrations by defence companies for member states . to show them the range of drones available. One . of the craft, the Spanish-built Fulmar, has a 10ft wingspan, cruises at . 60mph and can stay up for eight hours. The larger Israeli-manufactured . Heron is 26ft long and can fly for 52 hours at 35,000ft. Eye in the sky: Small drones could be deployed along the Mediterranean coastline to intercept large numbers of illegal immigrants crossing from North Africa in small boats . Both . can carry infrared sensors and sophisticated video cameras which send a . live feed back to a remote pilot at a ground station. Frontex . spokesman Edgar Beugels said UAVs may be suited to patrolling borders. He added: ‘There has been some interest in these from member states for . border-surveillance purposes. At the moment we are holding . demonstrations to see if these aircraft are a viable tool for border . surveillance. ‘They give . advantages as far as the possibility of hanging around in a  particular . area is concerned, possibly for as long as 12 hours, which is much . better than a conventional aircraft.’ The . biggest obstacle to the operation of large civilian drones is the risk . of collision with other aircraft, but Mr Beugels said: ‘I would imagine . that in the not-too-distant future there will be a legal framework in . place in Europe to allow these aircraft in unrestricted airspace.’ The EC wants to set up the network, . which includes using satellites, by next year, so only small drones will . be used at first. Current regulations mean the operator must maintain . visual contact with the aircraft and keep it within 1,500ft horizontally . and 400ft vertically of himself. In . Brussels earlier this year, defence contractors met EC officials hosted . by the European Defence Agency as they tried to forge plans allowing . drones and manned aircraft to fly side by side. Separately, . in one of the world’s most advanced trials of UAVs, BAE Systems has . teamed up with British firms Cobham, Rolls-Royce and QinetiQ, along with . German company Cassidian and French-owned Thales UK, to develop a . £62 million part-government-funded project called Astraea. A spokesman . for BAE said: ‘It’s important to be able to safely open up UK airspace . for these kinds of flights as there are many civilian applications. On the look out: Drone pilots use a bank of high-resolution screens which play in real time images from the aircraft. (File picture) ‘We are very aware that the idea of “robot planes” flying in the sky can cause people to be alarmed, but the fact is that sense-and-detect technology designed to keep them safely away from other aircraft is currently being proved.’ Lambert Dopping-Hepenstal, Astraea’s programme director, said the specially converted Jetstream aircraft being tested over the Irish Sea can detect and avoid other aircraft as easily as a piloted plane. He was confident regulators would give UAVs the green light sooner rather than later. ‘We might see some experimental uses of UAVs  by perhaps 2015, for example on coastguard patrol,’ he said. Privacy campaigner Nick Pickles, director of Big Brother Watch, believes that border surveillance drones may not be far off. ‘Border control is one of the biggest pressure points. We’re seeing an increasing demand to stick a drone in the air because it’s cheaper than a helicopter. ‘The danger is that we all end up being watched, but if something happens there’s no one there to  help you because they’re all manning the controls.’ The idea of unmanned drones humming around us, gathering our data, identifying us through photo-recognition and making their own decisions about whether to fire missiles, sounds like a dystopian vision of the future. In reality, the creation of autonomous robots is still a long way off, if it ever were to happen. The scenario imagined by so many Hollywood films, in which they could become uncontrollable killing machines, is simply the stuff of science fiction. Yet the potential use of unmanned drones  in Britain is growing increasingly likely. It  is inevitable that Britain will want to use technology to protect its borders. Future force: The US Defence Department is investing heavily in unmanned technology such as drone aircraft, similar to the one pictured . Any such plans would undoubtedly be met with hand-wringing from those who worry about breaches of civil liberties. Indeed, human rights lawyers have already warned of litigation against the Government. But Britain should press ahead with its use of drones in warfare. Indeed, not just in warfare – unmanned technology has many applications, is big business and can only benefit our economy. In war, there has only ever been the well-equipped and the less well-equipped. Those who refuse to get on board with technology end up on the losing side of any battle. Robots are nothing to fear. This technology is an industry that Britain’s economy could do with leading. The US Defence Department is putting out billion-dollar purchase orders for unmanned technology. A decade ago, less than five per cent of the US military’s aircraft were unmanned. Now more than  40 per cent fly without pilots on board. The few small companies selling kits, parts and accessories for private, amateur hobby drones in the UK are doing very well. We need to make sure that British companies profit on the large-scale applications, too. There will be no shortage of takers because the applications – and thus future markets  – are limited only by the imagination.  Drones can dust crops with pesticides, monitor atmospheric pollution, patrol for forest fires and carry out aerial land surveys. Photographers are looking to use drones equipped with cameras to provide them with a whole a new angle on their profession. Civilian drones have plenty to offer governments, too. In America, US Customs has been flying drones over mountainous or desert regions where human-traffickers and drug-smugglers operate with impunity. Life saving technology: Drones were used by search-and-rescue teams looking for survivors after the Haiti earthquake . Police-operated drones flying above our cities will enrage those who complain about Britain’s wide CCTV coverage. But most of us understand that when someone goes missing, it is a benefit to have cameras to capture their last recorded movements. Drone technology already saves lives. We send drones in to inspect the state of nuclear power stations, and the US military lent drones to search-and-rescue teams looking for survivors after the Haiti earthquake. But there are hurdles to overcome. There have been concerns over the high crash rate of military drones and critics warn of a future where drones are dropping from the sky several times a day. But these problems are being ironed out. The accident rate for drones is already lower than that for small, single-engined private aircraft. Another problem is the potential for collisions. Before drones fill our skies, they will have to be equipped with avoidance systems to minimise the possibility of accidents. Britain would do well to capitalise on the rising interest in drones, not bow to the worrywarts and squander the chance to lead the world in this new aerial revolution.","European Commission to spend .

"Stare closely at the pictures on this page. What do you think it took to create these beautiful images of Amy Winehouse, Mother Teresa, Princess Diana and Rihanna? An expensive camera, a precision lens, hours of trial and error from a skilled photographer? Well, the answer is none of the above. All of these extraordinarily detailed pictures are pencil drawings, created purely by hand — with no digital trickery — by British artist Kelvin Okafor, whose only tools are a set of pencils, a piece of paper and the occasional stick of charcoal (though most of the pictures don’t even require that). Yet no matter how closely one looks, there’s not a pencil line in sight. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Back to Black: Singer Amy Winehouse is shown staring wide-eyed into the distance in this emotive sketch . Windows to the soul: Kelvin Okafor begins with the eyes when he creates his realistic sketches of famous faces from Beyonce to Mother Teresa . The artist’s story is almost as . sensational as the pictures he has been producing since he was a . teenager who was too poor to leave his house to socialise. Instead of . drinking and clubbing, Ofakor, now 27, stayed at home in Tottenham, . North London, seeking solace in drawing. Now it looks as if he’s on his . way to fame and fortune. Today, an exhibition of his work . opens at London’s Science Museum — and already some of his portraits are . changing hands for £10,000 apiece. This week, a portrait he drew of . King Hussein of Jordan is to be presented to the late monarch’s widow, . Queen Noor. Anyone can commission a portrait, . though he will charge anything from £800 to £3,000 for his work. He says . he prefers to work from photographs rather than real life — partly . because of the length of time he spends on each picture. So how does Okafor create these . incredible works of art? ‘Before I start drawing, I spend a few hours — . even a few days — analysing the face from every angle. I usually start . with the eyes. From there, I make the whole shape of the face and I work . in the detail. Invincible: The Middlesex University Fine Art graduate is gaining increasing recognition with images including this one of pop star Tinie Tempah . Each work takes the 27-year-old up to 100 hours to complete, and he tries to inspire emotion in the viewer with vivid portraits. Pictured, Heath Ledger and Princess Diana . Beauty of life: Mr Okafor favours using a simple pencil because it is 'humble' and allows a subject - such as James Morrison, pictured - to shine . Rated R: The London-based artist has now scooped national awards and is exhibiting across the country.  Pictured, Rihanna . ‘I draw in sections. I’m right-handed . so I work from left to right. After I’ve finished the left eye, I work . the nostrils, then the left side of the cheek, then the lips. I always . work in that order. ‘I work for four hours in one go, . take a half-hour break, work another four to five hours, then have . another half-hour break. After that I’ll work for as long as I can. Sometimes I might work ten to 15 hours in one day. It takes me on . average 80 to 100 hours to do a portrait.’ He says the importance of hard work . was impressed upon him, his brother and two sisters by their parents. His father, who now works in the oil industry, was originally a warden . looking after a council estate; his mother stayed at home to bring up . the children. For this is a story not just about an incredible craftsman . but of the triumph of the human spirit, the value of faith and a . strong, loving family. ‘Absolutely. My parents came to this country from . Nigeria so that their children could have a better life. They instilled . the message that hard work pays off.’ Education mattered, too. His parents, . practising Catholics, fought for him to attend St Ignatius College, a . prestigious Jesuit school in Enfield, several miles away from their home . — whose ex-pupils include Alfred Hitchcock and Beatles producer Sir . George Martin. Okafor says: ‘Most teenagers . experiment a lot with their life. They have their experiences.’ He means . drink and drugs. ‘I didn’t have that. But, to be honest, I didn’t want . it anyway. I was too busy trying to focus on my craft.’ Okafor, who had gained nine GCSEs, . went on to study art at Middlesex University. It was here he found his . true vocation. ‘When I draw, I’m doing something I love. I lose myself . in my art. Time doesn’t matter to me.’ Incredibly, he was so absorbed in . his work he was at first oblivious to the riots which were raging . through his neighbourhood during summer 2011. ‘I was drawing at the time. My house . is a minute away from where it was happening. I heard helicopters and I . thought: “What’s going on?” Then I went outside and saw people running . around, and I started getting phone calls asking: “Kelvin, are you OK? There’s a riot in Tottenham.” It was a big shock to me.’ Okafor believes he might never have . become an artist had he not needed to look for a distraction. For his . upbringing was far from privileged — not that he is the sort of person . to complain about life. He grew up in one of the country’s . poorest areas, where he still lives with his family. As an 11-year-old, . he returned home with his family from an extended holiday to find their . house had been repossessed. ‘It was just before I started . secondary school and my life changed completely. We were homeless — not . living on the street but we didn’t have a house for ourselves for the . next three years. We moved from place to place, from cousin to cousin.’ He lived in five different homes over . the course of just a few years — before eventually moving into a . council flat, where the family remain today. Why did the family lose the house? ‘I . never knew. I just came back from Nigeria and found we weren’t living . in that house any more. I’ve never really wanted to press my parents on . the subject. I just accepted what had happened and moved on. ‘It was a struggle. That’s why I . spent a lot of time by myself, drawing. I didn’t have the luxury of . going out and spending money.’ Today, his greatest pleasure is the . pride he knows his success gives his parents. The other day, his local . TV news carried a short item about him. ‘I don’t think I’ve ever seen my dad . cry before. But he cried when he saw me and my art on the BBC. And my . mum. Everyone was emotional. I was crying. It makes me feel happy to . know I am making my family proud. That means the most to me. It makes me . want to work harder and do more.’ In line for fame and fortune: Singer Corinne Bailey Rae, left, was another source of inspiration for Kelvin Okafor, right .","Subjects range from singers Beyonce and Amy Winehouse to Mother Teresa and Princess Diana .

"Blame: Judge Marson, pictured, said that although the boy carried out the rape the main instigator was the 12-year-old girl . A 12-year-old schoolgirl dared a boy to rape her friend and screamed 'you're not finished' when he tried to stop, a court has heard. The bully punched the 11-year-old victim as she resisted the horrific sex attack by the 14-year-old male in West Yorkshire, who was worried he would look like a 'wimp' if he did not do it. Leeds Crown Court heard the horrific case and the girl ringleader and the rapist were both sent to young offender institutions for 28 months. In a shocking hearing yesterday it was revealed that the girl protagonist was laughing throughout the rape in October 2010. The boy, now 15, admitted the attack but a judge said he was satisfied his younger co-accused, now 13, was the instigator of the heinous crime. Judge Geoffrey Marson said: 'I accept although you were the older you were encouraged by a younger, stronger character.' She was the one to suggest playing dares and had punched the girl when she resisted, he said, adding, despite their age he said there was no alternative but to impose 28 months detention. Jason Pitter, prosecuting, said the girl had been domineering and bullied the victim, although they had a form of friendship. On the day concerned they had ended up back at the girl defendant’s home in her bedroom and were later joined by the youth. It was at that point the 12-year-old suggested a game of dares to the other two. 'It was a game that was to have serious consequences for the complainant,' he said. Shocking: The duo were sent to young offender institutions for 28 months after the hearing at Leeds Crown Court yesterday, pictured . The girl suggested the boy have sex with the 11-year-old who was punched in the face when she indicated reluctance to participate. The boy later said he had not seen that blow but was aware the girl was injured because he saw a cut to her lip. The girl pushed her on to the bed and after her lower clothing was removed the boy raped her but stopped when the victim told him to. Mr Pitter said the girl 'was encouraging what was happening and heard to be laughing.' When the boy stopped she told him: 'No you’re not finished' but he ignored her. Their victim ran home and her mother noticed her face was red. She said the other girl had hit her but did not at that stage reveal her ordeal. It was only  later she felt she had to speak out. Mark Foley, representing the boy, now 15, said: 'This was a very unusual and  extraordinary and exceptional set of circumstances.' The boy was extremely immature and vulnerable to pressure from a stronger  character. He said later he felt he could not back down on the dare because it would make him 'seem like a wimp.' Richard Reed, for the girl, now 13, said it was 'highly unusual offending particularly for a young female.' She too was immature and because of her troubled background had difficulty at the time empathising with the victim’s situation.","The bully laughed throughout the sex attack as she egged on the 14-year-old rapist .

"Teachers have banned parents from attending a school sports day in case it leads to a 'Hillsborough-style crush' on the playing field, it has been claimed. The bizarre ruling was enforced at Glapton Academy primary school in Clifton, Nottinghamshire, this week. Headteacher Ruth Ellis wrote to parents telling them they were not invited to next month’s event, which includes the traditional egg and spoon race, because of 'rising pupil numbers'. Furious: Lisa Darby (right) and other mothers are unhappy they have been banned from Glapton's sports day . The school claimed an increase in the number of parents wanting to cheer on their children could cause a crush on the playing fields. Some parents even say they were told the school implemented the ban in order to 'avoid another Hillsborough'. The newsletter to parents sent on Monday stated: 'Thursday 3rd July is planned for sports day. 'Unfortunately, due to rising pupil numbers, we will not be able to invite parents to sports day this year.' Yesterday, furious parents blasted the decision branding it 'health and safety gone mad'. Crowd control: The bizarre ruling was enforced at Glapton Academy primary school in Clifton, Nottinghamshire . David Elliott, 35, whose six-year-old son attends the school, said: 'This is bonkers. Simple as that. 'We got a letter from school saying parents would not be invited to this year’s sports day. 'I rang the school up and spoke to someone who said it was because of health and safety. 'I asked what that meant and the woman said it was because there were more pupils at the school and therefore more potential parents coming on sports day. 'When I asked what the school was afraid might happen she said there was a potential for a crush. I said ""what like Hillsborough?"" sort of as a joke, and she said ""yes"".' 'I was gobsmacked. I’ve never heard anything do ridiculous in my life.' The school claims an increase in the number of parents could cause a crush on the playing fields (pictured) Other parents threatened to boycott the sports day on July 3 in protest at the ban. Vicky Samson, 32, whose two children Elliott, 11, and Daisy-May, five, go to the school, said: 'I’m not happy about this at all. 'If we can’t watch, then my children will not be taking part in the sports day. 'My son is in Year 6, so it will be his last sports day - I really want to see him compete. 'The sports day is held on a massive field as well and it’s never full. 'They manage to cram all the parents into a school hall, but apparently we won’t be able to watch on the huge field.' Lisa Darby, 32, whose six-year-old daughter Libby is in Year 1, added: 'I was absolutely fuming when I read the letter. 'Sports day should be a family event and parents should be able to share their child’s excitement at taking part in all the races. The primary school became an academy in January 2013 and was rated 'good' by Ofsted in its last inspection . 'It’s also a big part of growing up - I remember having my parents there at every sports day when I was a child. 'They even used to take part in things like the egg-and-spoon race.' Ms Darby said she was allowed to attend every sports day when her older daughter Chloe, 13, was a pupil at the school. She added: 'It just seems really unfair on Libby now, that she can’t have her mum and dad there like Chloe did. 'I just can’t understand the decision. It seems a big enough sports field to me and I don’t think there are more pupils there than last year.' 'When you’re a working parent, it’s hard to get involved in school life, so you have to take every opportunity you can' Manda Wilkinson, 26, mother . Manda Wilkinson, 26, said her son Logan, eight, was upset to learn his parents wouldn’t be able to cheer him on. She said: 'I find it disgusting that the school aren’t giving us the choice over whether we want to come or not. 'When you’re a working parent, it’s hard to get involved in school life, so you have to take every opportunity you can. 'Are they going to stop us watching the Christmas plays next?' The primary school, which only became an academy in January 2013, was rated 'good' by Ofsted in their last inspection in June last year. Inspectors reported that the school - which caters for boys and girls aged between 3-11 - had 318 pupils on the roll, an increase from 284 who attended in 2010. The teachers’ union NASUWT also hit out at Glapton Academy, blaming their new status for the decision. Neil Lawrence, secretary of the union in Nottingham, said: 'The decision to ban parents from sports day is another example of the loss of control the community feels when a local school becomes an academy and withdraws from local authority control. 'Decisions are made arbitrarily and without consultation.' 'Safeguarding our children is our main priority' Nick Ydlibi, chair of governors . Roger Steel, Conservative Nottingham City Councillor for the Clifton North ward, added: 'It’s traditional that parents attend sports days and I can’t see any logic behind restricting them. 'There’s a benefit to both the children and the parents, who are proud to see their youngsters getting fit through sport.' The Association for Physical Education has also criticised the school’s decision. Spokesman Eileen Marchant said: 'Schools always have reasons for making decisions but it’s a shame this school hasn’t made public its reasons. 'Parents always enjoy going to school sports days and it’s important to have them there to encourage the children. 'So much investment has been put into primary schools through the Government’s PE and school sport premium. 'One of the things schools are expected to do with this is increase competitive opportunities for children. Sports day would be an ideal opportunity to showcase how they are achieving this.' However, Nick Ydlibi, chairman of governors, said: 'No parent has contacted the school to comment on the matter of us being 'unable to invite' parents to our sports day this year. 'Safeguarding our children is our main priority. We feel that due to the rise in pupil numbers along with the close proximity of current major road and tram works a lot of strangers are in and around our school locality. 'Because of this it would be extremely difficult for us to guarantee the safety of our children at an outdoor event with open gates; this is why this year, this very difficult decision has had to be made. 'Our school offers parents lots of opportunities to come to special indoor events, such as Glapton’s Got Talent, our Art Gallery, and Show Time events which are happening in June and July.' The Hillsborough disaster happened on April 15, 1989, at the Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield during a match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. A human crush resulted in the deaths of 96 people and injuries to 766 others. The incident has since been blamed primarily on the police for letting too many people enter the stadium and remains the worst stadium-related disaster in British history and one of the world's worst football disasters .","Ruling enforced at Glapton Academy primary school in Nottinghamshire .

"A hospital trust has paid out more than £400,000 in compensation and issued dozens of apologies over an ‘appalling’ catalogue of neglect.

One woman of 86, a former NHS nurse, was left unwashed and lying in her own faeces for 11 weeks because nurses were ‘too busy’ to help her into a bath. The woman, Patricia Bridle, later died. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt yesterday said he was ‘disgusted and appalled’ by the scandal centred on Alexandra  Hospital in Redditch, Worcestershire. The apologies follow Prince Charles’s  call last week for NHS staff to adopt a more caring attitude. It also comes in the  wake of the Daily Mail’s long-running Dignity for the Elderly campaign. Lawyers for 38 patients or their families began a class action against Worcestershire Acute NHS Hospitals Trust 18 months ago, following the release of a damning report by the Care Quality Commission into the standard of its care for the elderly. The watchdog warned patients were having to be prescribed water so they had enough to drink. In one of the worst cases, an 84-year-old starved to death in 2009 after being admitted following a fall. The man, who has not been identified at the request of his relatives, could only manage certain foods, but he was not fed properly and died two months later. On his death certificate, inanition, a clinical term for starvation, was recorded as the cause of death. Emma Jones from Leigh Day & Co, which represented the victims, said it was the first time in her ten years as a human rights lawyer that she had come across starvation being given as the primary cause of death. She added: ‘The failings we uncovered were appalling. Vulnerable and elderly patients were left starving and thirsty, with drinks left out of reach, buzzers ignored and people not being taken to the toilet and instead left to sit in their own faeces by the very people meant to be caring for them. ‘The families wanted an apology above all else and that is what they will now receive, in writing.’ The incidents took place between 2002 and 2011, with 35 cases brought against the Alexandra Hospital and three against the Worcestershire Royal, in Worcester. Let down: Peter Bridle said his mother . Patricia, pictured as a former NHS, was 'embarrassed and humiliated' The Trust, which runs both, has agreed to pay a total of £410,000 in compensation over the 38 cases – in five cases to patients who survived, the rest to those whose relatives died. The largest settlement is £22,500. Most are around £10,000. The lawsuit began last summer after CQC spot checks found ‘major concerns’ at the Redditch hospital and also Sandwell General in West Bromwich. Relatives contacted Leigh Day, who were involved in legal action on behalf of families caught up in the scandal at Stafford Hospital where it was estimated that up to 1,200 patients died unnecessarily between 2005 and 2008. Apology: Alexandra Hospital's head of nursing read the statement outside the hospital today . Appalled: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said he is 'disgusted' by the patients' and families' accounts . Mr Hunt said the Worcestershire class action highlighted the ‘sort of “care” that should  simply not happen in the NHS’. Last . month, he said there was a ‘kind of normalisation of cruelty’ in the . worst hospitals, with patients too often subjected to resentment, . indifference and even contempt. In 2010-11 death rates at the Worcestershire Acute Hospitals Trust were 10 per cent higher than the national average. Yesterday the trust said some of the ‘very serious allegations’ were ‘not borne out by the medical notes’, but admitted ‘certain aspects of care’ fell below standards patients were entitled to expect. Its mortality rates are now below the national average, it added. A 94-year-old woman was left permanently unable to walk after doctors failed to notice for two-and-a-half weeks that she had broken her hip. Lois Smith's daughter Lois Sumner said her mother, who suffers from dementia, was in agonising pain when she was admitted to Alexandra Hospital last May after a fall. Doctors spotted Mrs Smith had a broken wrist but her hips and legs were not checked, according to her daughter, who witnessed physiotherapists trying to get her mother out of bed to do exercise. Ignored: Doctors failed to notice Lois Smith had broken her hip for two-and-a-half weeks . She said: 'Every time I came to visit her she would just weep and say that no one ever responded to the bell when she rang it for help. She would be left for hours, thirsty, hungry or desperate for the toilet.' The family were among those taking legal action against the trust, with Mrs Smith leaving hospital with infections in both legs, which had been dressed in bandages covered in blood. Mrs Sumner lived next door to her mother but Mrs Smith has since moved to a care home because of her deteriorating mobility.

"Jumper: Omar Gonzalez successfully made it into the White House on September 19 due to a series of mistakes made by the Secret Service, according to a report given to Congress on Thursday . The man who jumped the White House fence and made it all the way to the East Room in September did so because of a dozen Secret Service fumbles, including an officer on the North Lawn who was too busy talking on his phone to notice the breach. Omar Gonzalez made it past scores of officers when he jumped the fence the evening of September 19 and ran across the lawn, breaking into the White House through the front door before finally being tackled by two officers clocking out of their shift. The military veteran was just one of five who have eluded security and made it on the lawn at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave this year, leading to the disgraceful resignation of Secret Service director Julia Pierson in October. However, he was the only one to make it inside the White House. On Thursday, Congress was briefed by the Department of Homeland Security on the errors that led to Gonzalez's breach of security, and the New York Times reported the findings after obtaining a  summary of the findings not yet released to the public. Gonzalez's history with the Secret Service goes all the way back to July 19,  two months before the day he broke into the White House, when he was stopped in Virginia and a search of his car uncovered 11 firearms, including an illegal shotgun and a map of DC with the White House highlighted. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives informed the Secret Service about the incident, but the office did not further investigate Gonzalez at the time. An investigation was opened into Gonzalez though when a report was filed by federal, state and local law enforcement officials in Virginia. Put the phone down: The report showed that one officer stationed on the North Lawn with an attack dog didn't respond to the breach because he didn't have his ear piece in and was on a personal call. Above, a map of Gonzalez's route into the White House . Dash: A video of the incident shows Gonzalez running towards the White House after getting past plainclothes security guards outside the fence. SWAT teams and an attack dog failed to stop him on the lawn . A month later, officers spotted Gonzalez outside the White House walking around with a hatchet tucked into his pants, but let him go because he was not breaking any laws. They reported his name however to headquarters and learned he was the subject of an investigation. A few minutes later, they went back to interview Gonzalez and found 'several empty firearms cases, four hatches, several bottles of urine and camping gear' in his car, but again could do nothing because he still wasn't violating the law. A month later, the day of the breach, Gonzalez was again spotted outside the White House gate around 6pm, but officers didn't stop him because he wasn't acting odd at the time. An hour later, Gonzalez quickly jumped over the fence at a point in the gate where there wasn't any ornamental spikes on the posts to slow him down. Officers were then slow to respond to the intruder because of 'unintelligent traffic of the radio'. Others had a hard time figuring out where the intruder was due to construction on the north grounds. One of the officers stationed on the North Lawn with an attack dog, didn't even hear the reports because he didn't have his ear piece on and was taking a personal call. He also didn't have his other radio on him, which was instead stored in his locker. Disgrace: Gonzalez is just one of five people who have made it past security at the White House this year, leading Secret Service Director Julia Pierson to resign in shame . That officer only noticed  Gonzalez when he saw two officers running towards the intruder on the lawn. By that time it was too late to get the dog 'locked onto' the target. Those first two Secret Service officers pointed their guns at Gonzalez, but the man continued past them towards the North Portico. They decided not to shoot because they believed he was unarmed. It was later revealed that he had a knife. From there, Gonzalez went into the bushes near the portico, and the officers stopped following him because they believed the bushes were too thick to pass through. They ended up being wrong and Gonzalez made it out on the other side, just feet from the front door. An officer stationed at the front door decided to hide behind a pillar with his weapon, to take Gonzalez by surprise and because he thought the front door to the White House was locked anyway. Hearing: This courtroom artist rendering shows Judge Deborah Robinson, left, presiding during White House fence jumper Omar J. Gonzalez's , center, case in court in Washington last month . He pointed his gun at Gonzalez when the man arrived on the front steps, but again Gonzalez would not take orders and the officer decided not to shoot. Surprisingly to that officer, the front door was indeed open and Gonzalez made it into the White House's Central Hall where a female officer tried to stop him. Gonzalez knocked that officer down and then proceeded to the East Room, before turning back around. Soon after, a pair of officers who just ended their shift tackled Gonzalez and finally brought him into custody. No Secret Service officers or agents have been disciplined yet in connection to the breach. That will likely happen after the larger investigation is finished. After hearing the report on Thursday, members of Congress expressed their disappointment in the agency in charge of insuring the president's safety. 'This report indicates that the Secret Service’s response at the White House was significantly hampered on September 19th because of critical and major failures in communications, confusion about operational protocols, and gaps in staffing and training. While some of these problems can be attributed to a lack of resources, others are systemic and indicative of Secret Service culture,' Rep Bennie Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi told the Washington Post. 'Some of these problems have begun to be addressed, however it is imperative that DHS follows through on these findings and institutes real reforms.'","Military veteran Omar Gonzalez jumped the White House fence and made it into the president's residence on September 19 .

"A mother opened a loaf of bread bought at a Tesco store to make a sandwich for her 10-year-old - only to discover it contained a blood-covered needle used by a heroin-taking grandfather. The mother had taken two slices from the pack of Roberts wholemeal bread - which she had bought from the Tesco Express in Pendleton, Greater Manchester - when she made the shocking discovery. The needle had been pushed through the plastic wrapper by David Rodgers, 61, when he visited the shop with his wife, in a desperate attempt to avoid her finding out he was back on the drug. Shocking: The mother had taken two slices from the pack of Roberts wholemeal bread - which she had bought from the Tesco Extra in Pendleton, Greater Manchester (pictured) - when she made the discovery . Rodgers had already used the needle for a heroin fix before he hid it in the bread last December. The mother, who bought the loaf later that day, was left 'alarmed and distressed' when she noticed the syringe while making the sandwich for her son, Manchester Magistrates' Court heard. She handed it in to police, who used DNA tracing to track down Rodgers, of Salford, Greater Manchester, who pleaded guilty to contaminating the loaf with intent to cause public alarm. The case was adjourned for pre-sentence reports and Rodgers was warned he could face jail. There was no suggestion Rodgers had a grudge against Tesco, Dominic Geelan, prosecuting, said.

Mr Geelan said Rodgers was at a loss to explain his actions. He added: ‘The only reason he could think of was that he didn't want his wife to know he was using heroin again.’ Rodgers was said to be aware of the 'hurt and distress' caused to the mother and her family. He accepted he could have thrown the needle on the floor or under shelving in the store. A Tesco spokesman said: ‘We have been working closely with the police throughout their investigation and on behalf of our customers are pleased that this has been resolved.’","Mother of son, 10, made shocking discovery in Roberts wholemeal bread .

"Children in Britain are less likely to grow up living with both parents than in almost any other country in the Western world. Just two thirds are still living in the same household as their natural mother and father by the age of 14. Only in Latvia, Estonia and Belgium are children more likely to grow up outside the traditional nuclear family, according to research by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. While 68.9 per cent of British children aged up to 14 live with both their parents, in the US the figure is 70.7 per cent and in France 79.5 per cent. The stability league . The UK proportion is also much lower than Germany on 82 per cent. Finnish children are most likely still to be living with both parents, at 95.2 per cent. Critics say the figures demonstrate the declining importance of marriage in the UK compared with our neighbours – and called on ministers to implement tax breaks for married couples. Marriage rates have more than halved in the past 40 years, while the number of lone-parent households increased by an average of 26,000 a year from the early 1980s to 2010. Family support: Iain Duncan Smith, pictured with wife Betsy, pointed to evidence that children tend to enjoy better life outcomes when the same two parents are able to give them support and protection throughout their childhood . Iain Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary, pointed to evidence that children tend to enjoy better life outcomes when the same two parents are able to give them support and protection throughout their childhood. Figures show that 28 per cent of children in lone-parent families live in relative poverty, compared with 17 per cent for couple families. Mr Duncan Smith said: ‘When families are strong and stable, so are children – showing higher levels of wellbeing and more positive outcomes. But when things go wrong – either through family breakdown or a damaged parental relationship – the impact on a child’s later life can be devastating. ‘We have already invested £30million in relationship support, to prevent family breakdown rather than waiting to pick up the pieces. ‘Across Government we’re working to improve the support available for families who experience abuse at home by more effectively punishing the perpetrator and doing more to educate young people about domestic violence.’ Norman Wells, from the pressure group Family and Youth Concern, said: ‘Children born to cohabiting parents are much more likely to see their parents separate than those born to married parents, and with almost half of births now taking place outside marriage rates of family breakdown look set to remain high. ‘With family breakdown costing the taxpayer an estimated £44billion per year, the Government should be unashamedly promoting the benefits of marriage and creating a climate which encourages couples to get married and stay married. ‘Most other European countries recognise marriage in the tax system, but in the UK the Government has been dragging its feet over fulfilling its coalition agreement pledge to introduce transferable tax allowances for married couples. ‘The Government should put that right without further delay and, at the same time, needs to start overhauling a benefits system that incentivises lone parenthood. For too long, government policy has pretended that all types of family structure are of equal value to society.’ The figures are contained in a ‘family database’ published by the OECD, which represents the world’s industrialised countries. They refer to 2007 – the latest year in which a comparison is possible. Across the organisation, which is mainly comprised of countries in Europe, North America and Australasia, an average of 84.1 per cent of children are still living with both parents at the age of 14. Stability: Mr Duncan Smith said: 'When families are strong and stable, so are children' The only countries below the UK on the league table are Latvia on 64.9 per cent; Estonia on 66.8 per cent; and Belgium on 65.0 per cent. However, the proportion is far higher in countries such as Italy (92.1 per cent), Spain (91.5 per cent) and Turkey (91.5 per cent). The family database confirmed that the UK has the highest proportion of children living in a single-parent household in western Europe – and is behind only the United States and Estonia in the OECD. Some 22.9 per cent of British children aged up to 14 are living with a lone parent, compared with only 9.2 per cent in Italy. In Germany the proportion is 13.4 per cent, and in France 13.3 per cent. Across the OECD the average is 15.9 per cent. Britain is beaten only by Estonia (24 per cent) and the United States (25.8 per cent). Christian Guy, managing director of the Centre for Social Justice, said the league table proved that ministers needed to recognise marriage in the tax system. ‘Timid politicians are becoming numb to Britain’s sky-high family breakdown rates,’ he said. ‘Behind too many front doors family instability damages adults and children. Yet, as these OECD figures show, broken families are not some inevitable feature of modern society or “social progress”. ‘All kinds of transformational help can be offered to parents and couples when they come under life’s pressures. ‘It is time for people who oppose things that would stem the tide of breakdown, such as backing marriage as the most stable path for children, to stop playing politics. Our forgotten families need all the help we can offer.’","Just two thirds of children still live with mother or father at the age of 14 .

"These shocking images reveal one of the violent beatings Craig Kinsella endured at the hands of a family who forced him to live 'like a slave' in their garage, scavenging for food. Ice cream business owner David Rooke, 44, his wife Donna, 40, and their 19-year-old son Jamie, subjected Mr Kinsella to a six-week campaign of 'unpleasant and casual' violence, treating him 'like a dog' at their Sheffield home. Mr Rooke was today jailed for six-and-a-half years after admitting falsely imprisoning and attacking Mr Kinsella. His wife was jailed for four months, while the couple's teenage son was sentenced to four years in prison. Scroll down for video .

David Rooke, left, his wife Donna, centre, and their son Jamie, right have been jailed for keeping Craig Kinsella as a slave at their Sheffield home for six weeks . Mr Kinsella . endured blows from pick-axes, spade handles and a crow bar, was forced . to use a bucket for a toilet and made to work for no pay. The family's campaign of terror, exposed by police in July last year, left their . victim so terrified he would work from 7.30am to midnight cleaning the garden and vans, receiving no pay in return. Judge Peter Kelson QC, sitting at Sheffield Crown Court said it was impossible to watch the CCTV footage without wincing. He said it was 'staggering' this could happen in modern society, adding the family treated their victim like a 'punchbag'. He ordered Mr Rooke to pay Mr Kinsella £15,000 in cash, that was discovered by police officers raiding the family home. Judge Kelson said: 'Quite clearly this in no way reflects the pain and suffering inflicted on Craig Kinsella but it’s better than nothing. 'His will had been completely broken by the way you treated him. You treated him like a dog. Man’s inhumanity to man never ceases to shock.' The judge added: 'He was fed very little - fed by way of food left out. He was kept hungry. He was constantly beaten and battered. 'He was just your punchbag, all three of you. If you were in a bad mood you would just go and kick and punch Craig Kinsella. 'It is staggering that this is happening in our society, absolutely staggering. It is almost unbelievable.' David Rooke, left, was sentenced to six-and-a-half years in prison for falsely imprisoning and attacking Mr Kinsella. His son, Jamie, right, was jailed for four years for affray and causing actual bodily harm . Judge Kelson told David Rooke: 'He was under your control. 'He was treated horrendously. He was treated like a dog. The conditions were grotesque and you were just exploiting him. 'This was two months of horrendous violence. One could not watch the CCTV without wincing repeatedly. You made him your punchbag.' Judge Kelson concluded his sentencing remarks saying: 'The hatred is simply immeasurable.' Commending South Yorkshire Police, Judge Kelson, said: 'My fear is that there are more of these cases about and we are now only beginning to discover them.' Mrs Rooke was jailed for four months after admitting a count of battery . Mr Rooke admitted false imprisonment today and a number of counts of causing actual bodily harm. Jamie Rooke admitted affray and a number of counts of causing actual bodily harm, while Mrs Rooke admitted a specimen count of battery. When Mr Kinsella was taken to hospital he was found suffering from a broken right arm, a fractured rib, extreme bruising . to his back and around his kidney, a fractured chin and cuts, and lumps . and bruises on his head and legs. Prosecutor David Brooke told the court how Mr . Kinsella lived in the garage at the side of the family home for about . six weeks before police intervened in July last year. He was not allowed . into the house. He said the victim’s life was completely controlled by the Rookes using casual violence and intimidation. Mr Brooke said one neighbour told police: 'He was like their slave. They talked to him like a dog. 'They used ‘horrible’ words. He never retaliated. 'He went on to explain that he'd been living in the . garage and that he'd slept on a piece of carpet and used an old curtain . as a blanket. 'He wasn't . paid by the family nor fed regularly and he regularly picked food from . the wheelie bin to eat. He was obviously emaciated.' Mr . Brooke said the victim initially told officers he deserved one of the . beatings because he had been stealing food from a wheelie bin. He . said Mr Kinsella began to work for the family a number of years ago and . was paid £40 a week so he could keep claiming benefits. But the Rookes took him to the post office to withdraw his money and took control of his finances, the prosecutor explained. He . had a flat in the city and was occasionally driven there to have a . bath, although the prosecutor said it was in a terrible state. He was . spotted washing his few clothes in a bucket. Mr . Kinsella eventually told police what happened to him after officers . were called to the bungalow following an incident in which Jamie Rooke . produced a knife during an altercation with a neighbour.

Mr Brooke said Mr Kinsella told . police he was regularly threatened by David Rooke who told him he would . be a 'dead man' if he escaped. He said Rooke told the victim: 'I'll hunt you down.' The . prosecutor added that Mr Kinsella was clearly scared about whether the . Rookes would track him down, even after he was with the police. Mr Brooke told the court this was a 'disturbing and unpleasant' case. He said: 'He became what he called a slave - working from 7.30 in the morning to 11 or 12 at night.' The court heard Mr Kinsella had learning difficulties and neighbours described him as being a bit 'slow'. Speaking outside court, Detective . Inspector Vicky Short, from South Yorkshire Police, said her officers . could easily have been investigating a murder. Ms . Short said: 'The physical and mental abuse meted out by the Rooke . family on a highly vulnerable man plumbed the depths of depravity. 'David, . Donna and Jamie Rooke abused Mr Kinsella for their own pleasure until . his spirit and will to stand up for himself and fight back was crushed.

"Crisis: Prosecutor Alison Saunders has warned of a rise in children committing domestic violence . Britain's incoming chief prosecutor today warned of an epidemic of children attacking their parents, as it emerged that more than 100 children aged 13 or younger were prosecuted for domestic violence last year. Alison Saunders stressed that domestic violence does not just involve partners fighting each other, but can see teenagers lashing out against their mothers and fathers. In 2012-13, more than 2,100 teenagers between the ages of 14 and 17 were prosecuted for domestic abuse, underlining the scale of the largely hidden problem. An 11-year-old boy in London was this year convicted of assault by beating after a court heard that he had punched his mother and thrown a drawer at her while fighting about a phone bill. A boy of 13 was convicted when his mother refused to give him money to spend on drugs and he threatened her with a knife. Over the past three years, a total of 8,395 children have been prosecuted for domestic abuse, which includes violence against parents, siblings and girlfriends or boyfriends, according to the Crown Prosecution Service. Ms Saunders, who is currently London's chief crown prosecutor but will start work as the new Director of Public Prosecutions next month, blamed the extraordinary amount of abuse carried out by young people on their lack of respect for authority. She also said that despite the impression of such incidents as being hallmarks of deprivation, they are in fact prevalent in all classes of society.

'One thing about domestic violence is . that it is not just in dysfunctional families or just the ones on . benefits, it goes across everyone,' she told the Evening Standard. 'Some of those we see are from really . badly dysfunctional families, but you also have middle-class and . upper-class people involved. 'There . is a lack of respect and a lack of regard for authority. When I was . growing up the thought of striking a parent was beyond the pale. 'Is . that peers, is that TV, is that the general environment in the house? You are not born to commit domestic violence. It's really about . nurturing.' Ms Saunders added that children who are violent towards their family could be encouraged to commit domestic abuse as adults. 'If . you are starting off hitting your mum then there is not a lot between . that and hitting your girlfriend, wife, partner when you are older,' she . said. This year the . Home Office ruled that cases involving 16- and 17-year-olds could be . included in domestic violence statistics amidst fears that such cases . had previously been wrongly ignored.","Over 800 children between 14 and 17 prosecuted for domestic violence .

"The childhood home of Charles Dickens - situated just yards from a former workhouse thought to have inspired Oliver Twist - has gone on sale for £760,000. The second-floor London flat was lodged in by John and Elizabeth Dickens in 1815, when their talented son Charles was just three years old. The family left the property, above a grocer’s shop, a year later, but the author returned to the street as a teenager between 1828 and 1831. The second-floor London flat was lodged in by John and Elizabeth Dickens in 1815, when their son Charles was just three years old . A picture taken in 1900 shows a different angle of the flat on Cleveland Street in Bloomsbury, London, lived in by Charles Dickens . The one-bedroom flat in Cleveland Street, Bloomsbury, has an original Georgian fireplace in the main room where the young Dickens is thought to have kept warm. The property, which is for sale through agents LDG, has large rooms, modern wooden floors and double-glazed sash windows. The author, who was the second of eight children, learned reading, writing and shorthand while living in the building and also used the address to apply for a reader’s ticket at the British Museum. Returning after his father’s imprisonment for debt, Dickens  sought to establish his independence at the property. The author, who was the second of eight children, learned reading, writing and shorthand while living in the building and also used the address to apply for a reader’s ticket at the British Museum . Lucinda Dickens Hawksley, Charles Dickens’s great-great granddaughter, unveiled a plaque to her famous ancestor at the Bloomsbury address in June last year.' Most other buildings linked to the author in Central London no longer exist. The building was Dickens’s first London residence after his young family moved to the city from Portsmouth. He went on to spend much of his life living in different parts of what is now the borough of Camden, but unlike Cleveland Street, many of the original roads and buildings are no longer recognisable. Also in Bloomsbury is the Charles Dickens Museum - a house in which the author lived between 1837 and 1839. The property, which is for sale through agents LDG, has large rooms, modern wooden floors and double-glazed sash windows . The one-bedroom second-floor property is near to Soho and Regents Park and is currently on the market at £760,000 . The Grade II listed property is located in Fitzrovia - a trendy part of central London littered with small pubs and restaurants . Laurence Glynne of estate agents LDG, who manage the property, said: 'It’s fascinating to think what Dickens would have made of the Fitzroy Place development across the road, where flats are being sold off-plan for £2,000 per square foot' For the five years that he lived in this street, Dickens could not ignore the presence of the Cleveland Street Workhouse upon his doorstep - as the fate that he struggled to avoid. The impression it made upon him inspired one of his greatest novels - Oliver Twist, published in 1837. Just ten doors away stands the former workhouse, built in the 1770s to accommodate the poor. The site has been used as a hospital for most of its existence. In its early days, local people bemoaned the inhumanity of the workhouse, praying that they never had cause to throw themselves on its cold charity.

"Stores have been accused of using copycat products, hiding away ingredients and inflating packs to fool shoppers. A study by consumer champions has identified ten packaging tricks which risk misleading customers about the health, quality and quantity of what they are getting. Which? surveyed hundreds of products and asked more than 7,800 of its members to point the finger at companies that are misleading shoppers. A Which? survey found that Tropicana's Mango and Passion Fruit juice was made from 87 percent apple . It found examples of fruit juice cartons where the main ingredient was omitted from the pack name and relegated to small print. For example, Tropicana Mango & Passion Fruit juice is actually 87per cent cheaper apple juice, while the firm’s Lemon & Lime Juice is 96per cent a mix of apple and orange. Many companies put nutrition information on the front of packs which is designed to tell shoppers ‘at a glance’ how healthy they are in relation to other similar products. However, a number use unrealistically small portion sizes as the basis of these nutrition claims, which makes the products appear healthier. For example, Waitrose offers a small individual ‘Essential’ cheese and tomato pizza that weighs just 165g, which would normally be eaten whole. However, the firm gives fat, salt, sugar and calorie information for just half the pizza. Similarly, the nutrition information on the front of a Goodfella’s extra thin pizza is given based on someone eating just one quarter of it when most people would eat at least half. Which? found that some packs of sausages and bacon given nutrition information based on eating just one sausage or rasher, when most people would eat two or three. The editor of Which? magazine, Richard Headland, said: ‘We’ve found packaging tactics across the supermarkets that run the risk of misleading customers. Supermarkets and manufacturers need to play fair to avoid confusing consumers. Tropicana's Lemon & Lime juice is made from 96 per cent apple and orange juice . ‘We’re campaigning for simple food pricing to make it easy for consumers to compare products and find the best deal.’ As we approach Christmas, many people will be buying gift packs as presents. However, Which? found a Lynx pack containing a deodorant and shower gel for £6.50 which could be bought separately for £5. Researchers also found a Dove gift set for £4.50 containing products that could be bought for £4.40. A number of supermarkets have created own-label products that bear an uncanny resemblance to big brands, which manufacturers have spent millions of pounds to create and promote. The budget chains Aldi and Lidl appear particularly keen to borrow from famous brands. Some 39per cent of people surveyed by Which? thought Lidl’s Tower Gate Ginger Nuts were actually McVitie’s Ginger Nuts. Lidl’s Newgate Cream of Tomato soup can looks very much like the Heinz version. Aldi’s Snackrite Thick Ridged Crisps also look similar to the popular ‘Real McCoys’ brand. Earlier this year, Aldi was forced to remove its ‘Saucy Salmon Fillets’ from sale following complaints and legal action from the Saucy Fish Company, who said they were a copy of its packs. Which? also found that companies use deliberately inflated packs to give a false impression. For example, it found boxes of Cadbury fingers were only two thirds full, while packs of Sainsbury’s Taste the Difference Amaretti biscuits were only 60per cent full. Some products contain ingredients that shoppers, particularly vegetarians, would not expect. For example, drinks like Lilt and Kia Ora orange squash with no added sugar contain fish gelatine. One of the biggest problems faced by shoppers is comparing the price of packaged fruit and veg versus the same products sold loose. In theory, those sold loose should be cheaper, but this is not always the case. Which? found bananas sold loose worked out at just 68p a kilo, while those sold in plastic bags were at least £1 a kilo. Other problems include products sold as ‘Fairtrade’ when this is not necessarily the case, ‘light’ products that are not as healthy as they may appear and product descriptions on cooked meat which are not clear . Example: Tropicana Mango & Passion Fruit Juice is actually 87% apple juice, 9% mango puree; 4% passion fruit juice. Tropicana Lemon & Lime Juice is mainly apple and orange with only 2% lemon and 2% lime. Response: Tropicana said drinks are named according to the main flavour, rather than the main ingredient. Small portion size used to skew nutrition figures. Example: Waitrose 165g ‘Essential’ pizza bases front of pack nutrition figures on only half the product. Goodfella’s pizza uses only one quarter of pizza for its figures. Response: Waitrose said the portion size represents a typical meal which would include other elements. Goodfella’s is changing labels to give figures for half a pizza . Waitrose's ‘Essential’ pizza bases front of pack nutrition figures on only half the product . Copycat brands. Example: Lidl’s Tower Gate Ginger Nuts mimic McVitie’s product; Aldi’s Snackrite Thick Ridged Crisps are similar to ‘The Real McCoy’s’. Response: Aldi says generic colours help shoppers find what they want. Lidl says it ensures own-label are clearly differentiated. Poor value gift sets . Example: Lynx gift set costing £6.50 contained a deodorant and shower gel that would normally cost £5. Response: Manufacturer, Unilever said retailers set the prices. Excess packaging . Example: Cadbury Fingers 114g box is two-thirds full; Sainsbury’s Taste the Difference Amaretti Biscuits is only 60% full . Response: Sainsbury’s blamed ‘settling’ in the bag. Cadbury’s said it is reducing packaging. Cadbury Fingers 114g box is only two-thirds full but the company said it is reducing the size of packaging . Off-putting names hidden in the small print . Example: Sainsbury’s British chicken breast slices are actually ‘Cooked, reformed chicken with less than 15% added water, and starch’; Lidl’s Hazelmeade Farm honey roast ham slices are ‘Cooked and honey roasted reformed ham slices with added water’. Response: The product details are clear on the pack. Fairtrade . Example: Cadbury Dairy Milk chocolate bars carry Fairtrade logo, however not all the cocoa it uses comes from a Fairtrade farmer. Response: Fairtrade Foundation say it is not always possible to keep Fairtrade and non-Fairtrade cocoa separate. Fairtrade farmers get a price premium of $200 dollars per tonne. Fruit and Veg . Example: Produce sold in packaging is not always clearly labelled to help shoppers make a price comparison with items sold loose. Response: Supermarkets say they include information in terms of price per kilo on the shelves of packaged and loose produce. Surprise ingredients . Example: Lilt and Kia Ora orange squash with no added sugar contain small amounts of fish gelatine not listed in the ingredients. Response: Both brands are owned by Coca-Cola which said it avoids the use of ingredients of animal origin in its drinks, but in some cases this is not possible. Flora Buttery Light may appear healthy, however it actually contains 45g of fat per 100g . Light . Example: Flora Buttery Light may appear healthy, however it contains 45g of fat per 100g; McVitie’s Light Digestives contain 4.5g of sugar per 100g than standards ones; Mary Berry’s Light Salad Dressing contains 21.9g of sugar and 21.9g of fat per 100g. Response: Unilever said the Flora label complies with the rules; McVitie’s said the removal of fat from the digestives, required an increase in the carbohydrate and sugar; the Mary Berry brand said the fat level was 50% less than the original product.","Tropicana's Mango & Passion Fruit juice is 87per cent apple juice .
The company's Lemon & Lime is a 96per cent mix of apple and orange .
Kia Ora and Lilt may have no added sugar but do use fish gelatin .
Which? discovered that loose fruit is more expensive than pre-bagged ."
"The tech executive who was brutally beaten by a furious bikers in front of his wife and daughter was attacked by a gang six men who stomped on his head and body as he tried to crawl away, it has been revealed. The NYPD have arrested two men and are seeking the identity of a third in connection with the broad daylight, but new cell phone video reveals there are even more suspects from last Sunday's incident in Manhattan. Robert Sims, 35, who turned himself in on Friday, is accused of being one of them men who stomped Alexian Lien after mobbing his black Range Rover. Also charged is Reginald Chance, 38, who is allegedly the biker seen bashing out Lien's car window with his helmet in a viral video filmed by a fellow rider. Do you know this man: He is wanted by the NYPD for questioning . In custody: Reginald Chance, 38 (pictured left and right) surrendered himself to police in connection to the Sunday attack on an SUV driver . The New York Post reports . that police are looking for up to six suspects in Lien's assault. The . six-on-one beating left Lien hospitalized and terrified his young . daughter and wife, who were in the SUV. An NYPD spokesman declined to comment Saturday evening as the unidentified person of interest's involvement in the attack. Both Mr Chance and Mr Sims have been charged . with attempted assault, gang assault and criminal possession of a . weapon, according to the New York Post. Mr Sims was seen on video stomping on the defenseless father's head, as well as punching and kicking him, prosecutors say. Mr Lien suffered two black eyes, as well as cuts on his face requiring stitches, according to a criminal complaint. 'The defendant is clearly seen stomping on [Lien’s] head,' assistant district attorney Joshua Steinglass told Manhattan Criminal Court Judge Diana Boyar during Saturday arraignment. A staggering $100,000 cash bail was set. Both men have lengthy criminal records, with Mr Chance's rap sheet showing 21 arrests for a litany of crimes including felony drug, robbery and weapons charges. Mr Sims' criminal past includes car theft, drug and weapons possession charges - including for a samurai sword. Badly injured: Lien needed stitches after he was attacked by bikers in New York. He hit some bikers in a bid to escape them but they caught up and beat him . Christopher Cruz, right, is charged with a misdemeanor, accused of starting the entire incident by cutting of Lien. He is not accused of participating in the beating . Meanwhile, NYPD spokesman John McCarthy confirmed Saturday that the unnamed detective believed to be an off-duty narcotics officer and member of a biker club was stripped of his gun and badge pending the outcome of an internal affairs investigation why it took the agent four days to come forward. He was riding with the Frontline Soldiers biker club, according to the New York Post. The papers aid the club also counts several others among its members. Mr McCarthy said internal affairs was also trying to determine investigating whether any other officers were present during the Sunday altercation and didn't immediately report it. It has been reported this week that at . least five off-duty cops witnessed the beating of Mr Lien, who was driving an SUV on the Henry Hudson Parkway last Sunday . with his family inside. The incident left Lien needing stitches and motorcyclist Edwin Mieses Jr possibly paralyzed. Among the officers reportedly riding in the biker rally were at least two detectives and three other officers who did little to stop the attack. One of the detectives, the undercover narcotics agent, watched as the . violence broke out and chose not to break it up for fear of ruining his . cover. Undercover officers are required to immediately report being a witness to a crime. Uniformed officers are required to take police action if they see a crime occurring, but the rules are murkier for undercover officers who face blowing their cover, confusing civilians who don't realize the undercover is really a cop and compromising years-long investigations. Before and after: Edwin Mieses Jr suffered a broken spine, fractured ribs, a punctured lung and a torn aortic valve and now may never walk again . The five officers were not the only ones present, WABC . is reporting that the NYPD is investigating whether several off-duty . corrections officers were also there. Police who saw the violent attack . did not begin coming forward until Wednesday - four days later. Investigators have already questioned some of the six individuals seen in the YouTube video of the assault, according to WABC. They plan to talk to as many as possible, the station noted. 'This is a complex investigation with a lot of people involved,' a source told WABC. One of the bikers who spoke to investigators said that Mr Lien 'drove erratically and bumped the bike on the side,' adding 'when he bumped that bike on the side, that bike became aggressive because his life was in danger,' according to WABC. The New York Post originally reported that the first undercover officer to admit being at the ruthless pounding was not the only cop at the scene, as several members of the motorcycle group- called the Front Line Soldiers- are police officers themselves. When reached Friday by MailOnline for comment, an NYPD spokesperson said only that the involvement of off-duty officers 'is under investigation.' 'It is does not appear that he got involved at the scene,' a police source told The Post, which added that the undercover officer has hired a lawyer. Mr Lien's Range Rover tapped the back tire of this motorcycle after he appears to dramatically slow down . On camera: This shows the moment the Range Rover driver panicked and hit some of the bikers as he tried to get away to protect his wife and child. It is believed he hit Jeremiah Mieses here . When they come to a standstill in heavy traffic, it takes moments before a biker jumps off and attacks the vehicle, smashing the driver's window with his helmet . He was not the only one to do so, as longtime partner of Edwin Mieses Jr, the man who was run over by the car, has hired famed defender Gloria Allred. 'He is the best father I know,' Dayana Mejia said at a Friday press conference. 'To learn that he almost died and that he may not walk again- that is all still sinking in. 'It tears me up that anyone could think that Edwin in anyway deserves what happened to him.' Mr Mieses was one of dozens of bikers who rode alongside a black Range Rover on Manhattan's West Side Highway last weekend until a biker slowed down and the vehicles bumped, police said. Video captured at the scene shows the SUV surrounded by helmeted riders. The broken window on the passenger side of the vehicle shows that the male driver was not the only target . Scary: The Liens said they feared for their lives . Towed away: The car was brought to the NYPD's 33 precinct on Friday . In the video, one rider approaches the vehicle and peers into the driver's side window. Police said others tried to damage the SUV before the driver, Mr Lien, took off and plowed over Mieses. The . bikers then chased after Mr Lien and smashed his car window with their . helmets, then pulled him from the SUV and beat him to the point where he . required stitches. Rosalyn Ng, Mr Lien's wife, said in a prepared statement that . her family's sympathies go out to Mr Mieses, but that they had to flee a . dangerous situation. 'He is the best father I know,' Dayana Mejia, Mieses' longtime partner, said at a Friday press conference . Support: Ms Mejia, seen with attorney Gloria Allred and Mieses' father Edwin Mieses Sr, said that they are still coping with how to deal with Edwin's injuries . Mr Ng said her husband was trying to protect her and their 2-year-old child, who was also in the car at the time. Mr Mieses, from Lawrence, Massachusetts, suffered a broken spine, fractured . ribs, a punctured lung and a torn aortic valve, according to Ms . Allred, who said during a press conference that his injuries may have left him paralyzed. Pain: Ms Mejia said that it is wrong to cast any of the blame of the incident on her partner . 'He told everyone to move on and go back to riding, and turned his back to the SUV to start walking back to his own bike,' Allred said. 'It was then, with his back to the SUV, and as he was in front of it, that he was run over and crushed,' the attorney added. A difficult situation has been made worse by what she described as a 'perception' that some people have about the riders who participated in the rally on Sunday, said Ms Mejia . 'They are not gang members. They are not thugs,' Mr Mejia said. 'They are FedEx drivers, plumbers, military reservists, musicians. They are fathers and brothers and sons, and sisters and mothers.' She also said Mr Mieses, the father of her children, didn't know any of the people he was riding with on Sunday aside from one friend who traveled to New York with him. The potentially paralyzed biker was recently arrested in Andover, Mass., for driving with a revoked license. He also never applied for a motorcycle license. Records show that in June Mr Mieses was named a habitual offender and his right to drive in the state was revoked until 2017. It wasn't clear if he had been licensed in any other state. The large contingent seen on the video were participating in a periodic rally in which more than 1,000 bikers head for Times Square, police said. The Manhattan district attorney's office has charged one rider, 28-year-old Christopher Cruz, of Passaic, N.J., with unlawful imprisonment and reckless driving while authorities continue to search for other cyclists. Investigators and prosecutors are tracking down and talking to dozens of helmet-clad motorcyclists seen in the video, which was posted online.","The New York Police Department has released two pictures of a man wanted in connection with the savage attack .

"The Dickson County Sheriff's Office in Middle Tennessee ended up paying a ransom after a malicious computer program blocked access to their files. Detective Jeff McCliss told WTVF-TV that malware on a computer locked the agency's case files, which included autopsy reports, witness statements and crime scene photos. He says the malware, called 'Cryptowall,' doesn't tamper with files on a computer, but keeps them locked until a ransom is paid. No choice: Jeff McCliss grimaced when he was forced to pay $500 worth in bitcoins in order to retrieve case files locked by a computer virus called Cryptoware . 'Every sort of document that you could develop in an investigation was in that folder. There was a total of 72,000 files,' McCliss said Tuesday. After consulting with the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and the FBI, McCliss said the agency determined the only way to get their files back was to pay the asking price: $500 in bitcoins. Officials think the malware came from an ad someone in the department clicked on. 'Is it better to take a stand and lose all that information? Or make the payment grit your teeth and just do it?' he said. 'It made me sick to have to do that,' he said. McCliss says it doesn't appear that the office was targeted and that it could happen to any computer. WDKN General Manager Kenneth Forte said the police station’s web use is hosted by third party company, Securenet Systems. They believe the problem has been fixed. 'It's a bad feeling. It's a very bad feeling to be the victim instead of the investigator,' he said. Cyber crimes like these are hard to investigate because oftentimes criminals are anonymous online users and commit their crimes overseas.

"Officials are concerned about the possible spread of rabies through the booming trade of puppies illegally smuggled into Britain from Eastern Europe. Thousands of dogs are being transported to the UK in squalid conditions and are often missing crucial vaccinations, before being sold to unsuspecting families for huge profit. A charity investigation has revealed how both corruption and ‘shocking’ animal welfare run through the heart of the puppy trade. Scroll down for video . Young puppies too young to be transported are being illegally imported from eastern European puppy farms . Dogs Trust said huge numbers of newborn puppies – below the legal age for transportation – are being smuggled in from eastern Europe due to a lack of border checks, and warned Britons to be cautious if they buy a pet from abroad this Christmas. After being brought to the UK in appalling and cramped conditions, the dogs are sold on to well-meaning families, who believe they have been legally imported and undergone rigorous health checks. Investigators said that four out of five vets they approached in Lithuania admitted to falsifying pet passports or vaccination records, or said they would be willing to. Meanwhile, nine of the 11 breeders and dealers they tracked down in the country said they would sell underage puppies to the UK, or already had done. Dogs often travel more than a thousand miles, and many are unvaccinated – meaning they risk spreading diseases such as rabies to other family pets. Pet dealers admitted to Dogs Trust investigators on camera that they can make up to £100,000 a year. Families who buy illegally imported dogs could be hit with large vet fees and quarantine costs . Popular breeds such as French bulldogs and pugs are regularly advertised for sale online from around £750 each. The dealer will pay roughly £200 to buy each dog and arrange its transport to Britain, meaning they can make £550 per sale. The growth in dog trading was triggered by a relaxation of the pet passport rules in 2012, allowing owners to travel with their animals without a lengthy quarantine period. But UK border control insiders told the Mail that the scheme is being widely abused to import huge shipments of dogs. The number of declared puppies entering Britain from Lithuania increased by 780 per cent between 2011 and 2013, while from Hungary the figure rose 663 per cent. And this does not include the thousands of puppies thought to go undeclared at the borders. Four out of five vets in Lithuania admitted falsifying vaccination records for dogs awaiting export . Paula Boyden, veterinary director at Dogs Trust, warned last night that the trade will only increase in the run-up to Christmas as dogs are bought as gifts. ‘The risk of unknowingly bringing a puppy from eastern Europe with diseases and behavioural problems into the home is very real,’ she said. ‘Buyers must be vigilant, as a puppy brought in from eastern Europe could cost far more than expected.’ If the authorities identify a pet as having been imported illegally, it is the new owners – not the dealers – who are forced to pay vet fees and quarantine costs. Dogs Trust said this has led to puppies being abandoned when families cannot afford the bills. The Dogs Trust said some families will abandon their dogs when faced with unforeseen vet bills . A Defra spokesperson said: . 'Responsibility for stopping the illegal movement of puppies begins in the country where they are born, and we are writing to the authorities in Lithuania and Hungary to remind them of their duty to ensure passports are correct and the welfare of pets intended for sale is safeguarded. 'Every pet travelling with its owner on an approved route is checked for compliance with the pet travel regime and the Border Force carry out a wide range of checks on animals arriving in the UK. Stringent penalties are already in place for those that breach the law by smuggling animals or using false documentation. 'Changes to the pet passport scheme this December will further strengthen the system across the EU by increasing traceability and making the pet passport harder to forge or tamper with. People in the UK can also help end this trade by insisting to see a puppy with its mum, which is the best way to ensure the dog's welfare.' Re rabies… . 'The risk to the UK from rabies is very low and changes to pet travel scheme will make risk even lower. Significantly, there hasn’t been a single case of rabies in the EU linked to pet movements since the pet travel scheme started in 2004.'","Thousands of puppies will be illegally smuggled into Britain next month .

"Just three weeks after training with the Royal Life Saving Society UK, Ashley Matthews put his training into practice, dramatically saving the lives of his family and girlfriend in Spain. The student, 20, from Over in Cambridgeshire, hired a motorboat with his parents and girlfriend in Puerto Pollensa, in northern Majorca, to reach a secluded bay only accessible by water. As they travelled further away from the shore, the weather took a turn for the worse, the sea became choppy and water began to fill the boat. Ashley Matthews, with his girlfriend Helen Sambrook: The student acted fast when his family's boat capsized . His parents Russ, 55, and Jane, 53, and girlfriend Helen Sambrook, 22, also a student, were unable to reach their life jackets because the wind was so strong it held them at the rear of the boat. Ashley edged his way to the front of the boat to get the life jackets - almost falling into the water as he went - and found there were only three on board. Handing them to the others, he braced himself for the boat to capsize in the waves crashing around them. The boat overturned and Ashley's father, Russ, a manager at a freight company, became trapped underneath. Life saver: Ashley, pictured right, with Helen Sambrook said he thought he and his family got off lightly . Ashley quickly swam below the waves and pulled him free and all four clung to the overturned hull which was drifting around half a mile off shore. The family was rescued when a passing yacht spotted them and hauled them on board. Ashley, a PE student at Leeds Beckett University, had recently passed a lifeguarding course, one of many courses offered by the Royal Life Saving Society UK. He said: 'I feel that we got off lightly. It could have been a lot worse. I think it was down to the fact that training allowed me to act. 'The beach seemed like an eternity away. We were out way too far and could only hope for a miracle.' Holiday hell: Ashley's family were rescued when a passing yacht spotted them and hauled them on board . He added: 'I never dreamed that I'd need the skills I learned on the lifeguard course so quickly and that it would help my own family. It was quite a shock afterwards.' His mother, Jane, said: 'I was really panicking, I dread to think what would have happened if Ashley wasn't there. I am so proud of my son, he is amazing. 'It was very lucky he'd done the course just before we went, either way we would have got on that boat, it was just by chance he knew what to do and selflessly gave us the life jackets. 'Only when we got on the yacht did we realise Ashley had badly cut his knee and it was pouring with blood - he didn't make a fuss at all.'","Ashley Matthews, 20, from Cambridgeshire, hired a motorboat with family .

"The number of children being bullied on the internet has doubled this year, with more than one in three now victims, research suggests. In a poll of 11 to 17-year-olds, 35 per cent reported that they have experienced cyber-bullying - compared with 16 per cent last year. Four in 10 said they had witnessed others being picked on online - almost double the 22 per cent recorded last year. Scroll down for video . One in three young children have been bullied online over the past 12 months according to new research . The study also suggests that thousands of teenagers, including many aged 15 or under, are using messaging service Snapchat and dating app Tinder every day. Some parents even helped set their children up with accounts, prompting fears that they are unwittingly putting them at risk. Internet security firm McAfee polled 2,000 UK children and 2,000 adults with at least one child aged under 18 ahead of the start of Anti-Bullying Week on Monday, and compared the findings with a similar study carried out last year. The research indicated that there is a more relaxed attitude among increasing numbers of parents regarding the risks posed online. Less than a third of parents said they were worried about their child being the victim of cyber-bullying this year - almost halving from 45 per cent in the previous year, while two-thirds of children are now allowed to go online without supervision - up from 53 per cent. However, more than three-quarters of mothers and fathers polled said they had conversations about online safety, up from 68 per cent last year. Andy Phippen, professor of social responsibility in IT at Plymouth University, said: 'The responses from McAfee's survey shows that there is a real gap between parental concern and the reality of what children face online. 'While it is encouraging to see that these conversations are happening, there are areas in which parents may not be completely aware of their children's online behaviour. 'It's now time for parents to take the conversations to the next level and become further educated on the social platforms that exist, what ages they are suited for and what type of behaviour they encourage. 'Cyber-bullying happens across all platforms and children's use of social media is transient.' One in six youngsters admitted using  Tinder daily with the dating app more popular with girls than boys . Around one in six of the youngsters polled reported using Tinder every day, with almost half of those aged 15 and under. The service was more popular among girls than boys, with one in five female respondents using it compared with 15 per cent of males. Tinder users are shown other subscribers close to their location and must give a positive reaction to them in the form of a tick, and receive one back in order to start communicating. It is open to those who are 13 or older, with under-18s only able to match with people in the same age bracket. Prof Phippen said: 'It is very concerning to see the proportion of younger teens using apps like Tinder, whose aim is essentially hook-ups and dating, and very much for an adult audience. 'These apps also share location-based information and can be used as platforms for grooming and abuse.' More than a third of children polled reported spending up to 10 hours on Snapchat a day. Reports recently emerged that explicit images taken with the app were intercepted by a third party app and leaked online. Prof Phippen said: 'Social platforms like Snapchat are becoming more and more popular with kids and children may not realise the risks of exposure they face.' One per cent of parents admitted helping set up Tinder profiles for their children, while nearly one in 10 gave them a hand joining Snapchat. The research did not specify the ages of the children whose parents helped set up accounts, other than that they were under 18. Samantha Humphries-Swift, of McAfee, said: 'As a mother myself, it is worrying to see that parents are setting up social profiles for their kids and, as a consequence, unknowingly putting them at risk online.' Last week a report from the Health Select Committee said MPs heard evidence that sexting, cyber-bullying and inappropriate online content has caused a direct increase in mental health problems in children, including stress and anxiety.","Cyber bullying rates have more than doubled over the past 12 months .

"By: KATHARINE BARNEY . Convicted: Adam Gordon attacked Rachel Kirby . A burglar who repeatedly punched a . heavily-pregnant woman in her stomach after she woke to find him . ransacking her bedroom has been jailed. Adam Gordon, 22, brutally attacked Rachel Kirby, 31, up to 11 times after she bravely fought him off. The . expectant mother - who lived in the same street as her . attacker - was knocked to the floor before being pounded in the stomach . by Gordon. It is believed that she went on to have a healthy child. Police later caught the father-of-two - . despite him trying to hide his face during the brutal assault by wearing . Miss Kirby’s pink hooded dressing gown. Gordon, from Fenton, Staffs., was . caged for 38 months at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court on Tuesday after . admitting burglary and causing actual bodily harm. Jailing Gordon, Judge Paul Glenn told him: 'The victim was plainly vulnerable, living alone and heavily pregnant. 'I accept in panic, to avoid detection and to escape, you attacked her. 'But you could have pushed her aside and fled. 'There was no need to use the sort of violence you did. You punched her repeatedly. Ordeal: The house where a heavily-pregnant Rachel Kirby was punched 11 times in the stomach . 'It is a matter of good fortune her injuries were not more serious. 'It was an extremely frightening incident which I am quite sure she will never forget.' Gordon broke into Miss Kirby’s home just after 2.30am last December.

"A British fashion student who claims she was raped in a toilet on a college trip to Florence has been told she faces up to 12 years in an Italian jail on false allegation charges. Serena Bowes, 21, who has waived her right to anonymity, was on an undergraduate visit to the city when she says she was raped in a nightclub toilet. However, weeks after she returned home to Newcastle, she received a letter to say she faced charges for falsifying the rape - which she strongly denies. Facing charges: British fashion student Serena Bowes, 21, claims she was raped in a toilet on a college trip to Florence has been told she faces up to 12 years in an Italian jail on false allegation charges . Her family have until today to find legal representation to present her case in Italy, and if they fail they say the trial could go ahead in her absence. Miss Bowes, who is hoping to join the Army after she graduates, said: 'I just don't talk about it. It's as if I'm telling someone else's story. 'I will never go back to Florence because of what happened, never mind going to prison there. 'If I receive a prison sentence somewhere between four and 12 years my life will be over.' Her mother Adele, 41, added: 'It's like my hands are tied behind my back and I'm waiting for them to kidnap my daughter.' College visit: Miss Bowes, who is in her second year at Newcastle College, was on the trip to the Italian city of Florence in May as part of her fashion course . Night out: Miss Bowes had visited the nightclub in the city's Via della Vigna Vecchia (pictured) with a group of friends, and says she had started talking to a man inside . Miss Bowes, who is in her second year at Newcastle College, was on the trip to Italy in May as part of her fashion course. She had visited the nightclub in the city's Via della Vigna Vecchia with a group of friends, and says she had started talking to a man inside. She claims that as the the pair were made their way to the VIP area of the club, she was taken to the unisex toilet and attacked. The alleged assault was reported to police, and gave statements to officers, as well as being examined in hospital. Italian news reports from the time the allegations were made said police had watched CCTV images which showed Miss Bowes leaving the bathroom together with her alleged attacker, who was known in the nightclub. He faced no further action. Reliving the experience: Miss Bowes returned to Newcastle and tried to put the trip behind her, until she was sent a letter from Italian police informing her she faced charges for falsifying the rape - which she  denies . Miss Bowes then returned to Newcastle and tried to put the trip behind her, until she was sent a letter from Italian police, which she took to a nearby police station to be translated. 'I thought it was done with and I could get on with my life,' she said. 'I didn't think he was going to get prosecuted so I just wanted to get on with my life but this has brought everything back. It doesn't feel what actually happened is the problem any more - it feels like that has actually been forgotten about. Once this is all over that's when it's going to come back and hit me.' Her mother is trying to find legal advice to help with the case, and has raised the issue with her local MPs and MEPs, but says she is yet to find the help Miss Bowes needs. Carole Kitching, Principal at Newcastle College, said: 'Twenty-one-year-old student, Serena Bowes, told us about a serious assault whilst on a undergraduate college trip to Italy earlier this year. It took place during their free time, and as soon as staff were alerted they contacted the police and accompanied Serena, with the police to the hospital. 'Serena has been offered counselling and we continue to support her through this difficult time. We have met with her family on a number of occasions and have been in contact with her local MP about her case.' College: Miss Bowes is studying fashion at Newcastle College, where she has been offered counselling and support, with staff meeting with her family on a number of occasions . Under the Italian justice system if Miss Bowes is prosecuted she would not have to be present at the trial. If she were convicted she would be automatically entitled to two appeals. If she lost those appeals, judges could then start extradition proceedings although this is very unlikely as in Italy most sentences are suspended, except for very serious crimes. A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We are aware of an incident involving a British national in May 2014. We provided consular assistance when notified of this in October 2014. 'We stand ready to provide further support to the individual and their family at this difficult time.' A Home Office spokesperson: 'As a matter of long standing policy and practice we neither confirm nor deny whether an extradition request has been made or received until such time as an arrest is made in relation to that request.'","Serena Bowes, 21, says she was raped during on a college trip to Florence .

"School inspections are as reliable as flipping a coin - and many teachers waste hours preparing for visits, a think-tanks says (library image) School inspections favour trendy methods and force teachers to waste hours on pointless preparation, a report warns today. It calls for radical change,  saying Ofsted’s verdicts are only as reliable as flipping a coin. Many rely on personal preference and value independent work over learning from a teacher, think-tank Policy Exchange claims. Nearly three-quarters of teachers surveyed said they changed the way they worked during an inspection. The think-tank called for routine lesson viewings to be scrapped and for better training for inspectors. Its report has already inflamed tensions between Ofsted and the Government. Earlier this year, chief inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw said he was ‘spitting blood’ after learning that Policy Exchange and another right-leaning think-tank were preparing research questioning Ofsted’s effectiveness. He said he suspected the Department for Education of a campaign to undermine him. Education Secretary Michael Gove replied that he backed Sir Michael ‘100 per cent’. It later emerged Mr Gove had sacked the head of Ofsted. Baroness Sally Morgan – a Labour peer – claimed she was ousted in an attempt to politicise the watchdog, sparking further denials from Mr Gove and a fierce coalition row. Today’s report says it found ‘widespread disillusionment with the inspection regime’, with teachers using Twitter and blogs to criticise lesson observations that may be only 14 minutes long. Teachers gave examples of inspectors preferring independent learning to teacher-led lessons, the report says. It cites teacher and author Daisy Christodoulou, who analysed 228 Ofsted ‘best practice’  lesson descriptions. She found that ‘very few’ highly praised lessons involved ‘teaching facts’, while ‘very often’ lessons were criticised for ‘the teacher talking too much’ or for ‘activities that involve factual recall’. The report notes that Sir Michael has warned inspectors on at least seven occasions not to favour one style of teaching. However, it adds that it found a ‘consistent pattern in the preferred style of inspectors’ which often manifested itself ‘subconsciously’. The report by Policy Exchange comes as some 189 out of 262 teachers polled said they changed their teaching for an Ofsted visit (library image) One teacher said: ‘Everyone knows their current buzzword is “pace”. This means we have to assume children have the attention span of goldfish.’ Schools do ‘harmful’ amounts of preparation for Ofsted visits, which is a ‘complete waste of time’, the report says. Some 189 out of 262 teachers polled said they changed their teaching for an Ofsted visit. The report also says many of the 3,000 private inspectors lack training and experience. Ofsted suggested last night that reforms were imminent, adding many of the report’s findings ‘chime with our own’. Jonathan Simons, co-author, said the research suggests ‘you would be better off flipping a coin’ than relying on an inspector’s judgment of a lesson. The think-tank is calling for shorter, more frequent inspections, followed by in-depth  visits to struggling schools. Ofsted schools chief Michael Cladingbowl said it is looking at reforms including giving parents more information. But he added: ‘In my view, parents will always expect inspectors to spend time in classrooms when they visit a school.’","Ofsted's verdicts as reliable as flipping a coin, think-tank says .

"Gwyneth Paltrow in Ralph Lauren, Julia Roberts in Valentino and Halle Berry in Elie Saab – choosing the right dress for the Academy Awards is almost as important to Best Actress nominees as the award itself. And now, thanks to a clever graphic from a London digital media agency, you can see every single winning actress’s gown on one picture. MediaRun digital has created an ‘infographic’ of every winning dress worn on the red carpet and to collect their Best Actress award, since the very first Oscar ceremony in 1929. Scroll down for video . London agency Mediarun Digital has created this cute illustration of every dress worn by the Best Actress Academy Award winner . 67 dresses are shown in stunning detail, including Grace Kelly’s green Edith Head gown worn to collect her Best Actress win for The Country Girl in 1955 and Halle Berry’s incredible Elie Saab dress she claimed her award, for Monster’s Ball, in 2002. The first dress worn was by Janet Gaynor in 1929 for her performances in three films: Seventh Heaven (1927), Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans (1927) and Street Angel (1928). This was the only occasion on which an actress has won one Oscar for multiple film roles. Unlike today’s fierce competition to wear the biggest designer name, Gaynor’s simple knee-length skirt and grey top was ‘off the rack,’and not created by a designer name at all. ARMANI - Three wins: Worn by Jessica Tandy in 1990, Jodie Foster in 1992 and Emma Thompson in 1993 . DIOR – Two wins: Worn by Reese Witherspoon in 2006 and Jennifer Lawrence in 2013 . YVES SAINT LAURENT – Two wins: Jane Fonda in 1972 and Kate Winslet in 2009 . GUCCI – Two wins: Helen Hunt in 1999 and Charlize Theron in 2004 . JEAN PAUL GAULTIER – Two wins: Nicole Kidman in 2003 and Marion Cotillard in 2008 . The last dress drawn on the graphic is last year’s sweeping Dior strapless gown worn by Jennifer Lawrence. The actress won Best Actress for her turn in Silver Lining’s Playbook. Lawrence is up for the Best Supporting accolade this year, for her role in American Hustle.No doubt, as the face of Dior, she will wear another gown from the French fashion house. Dior has been the designer of choice for twowining actresses throughout the Oscar’s history; Reese Witherspoon also wore a dress by the designer in 2006, when she won the award for her portrayal as June Carter Cash in Walk The Line. But the designer with the most red carpet wins over the years has been Armani, as the Italian fashion powerhouse has dressed three Oscar-winning lead actresses; Jessica Tandy in 1990 for Driving Miss Daisy, Jodie Foster in 1992 for The Silence of the Lambs and Emma Thompson in 1993 for Howard’s End. The cute picture also lists the 16 occasions in which the winning actress did not appear at the ceremony to collect her award. Katherine Hepburn won Best Actress in a Lead Role in 1934, 1968, 1969 and 1982, but didn’t attend the awards on either occasion. Elizabeth Taylor, Maggie Smith and Glenda Jackson also chose not to collect their Academy Awards for Best Actress.","London media agency Mediarun Digital has drawn each of the 67 dresses .

"Australians often affectionately refer to Brisbane as just a 'big country town'. But it was more like a ghost city on Friday morning, as the city ramped up its enormous security operation in anticipation for the arrival of major world leaders tonight and tomorrow morning. The city's CBD was almost completely deserted as huge black riot vehicles took to the streets, steel and bulletproof glass barricades went up, helicopters constantly buzzed overhead and roaming squads of police stopped pedestrians on the street. Scroll down for video . Combination picture showing traffic  near the venue of the G20 Leaders Summit in Brisbane pictured (above) on Thursday and (below) after the road had been closed prior to the summit on Friday . The always bustling Queen Street Mall, which runs through the centre of the city, was utterly desolate with many shops closed - much to the disdain of many business owners - with few shoppers daring to brave the city. Brisbane City Council's is so worried the CBD will resemble a ghost town, with a public holiday declared on Friday to reduce traffic congestion, that residents were being urged to head into the city over the weekend. The council's G20 chair Julian Simmonds encouraged people to visit South Bank, the botanic gardens or the city mall. 'Please don't sit at home and watch the G20 pass by on the TV,' he said. Many residents fled the city earlier this week with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry Queensland telling Daily Mail Australia businesses had warned the government this would happen.

Not a soul could be seen down most of Elizabeth St - where Russian President Vladimir Putin will stay when he arrives tonight - except for a lone police officer on watch duty, who was casting his eye down the road from a top level of multi-storey carpark. Some punters relished in the city's public holiday to take their pets for a walk through the CBD, taking advantage of the clean air and vacant footpaths. Brisbane residents Darren Evans and Natalie Rayment took their two dachshunds for a stroll, something they 'don't usually do', they told Daily Mail Australia. Elsewhere in the city, around 250 people gathered to take to the streets in a march about Indigenous deaths in custody curling through the city, in what police expected would be the biggest protest today. But while residents might have cleared out the G20 Summit is still expected to generate more than $100 million for Brisbane's economy, according to Queensland's tourism minister. Empty streets are seen in the central district of Brisbane on Friday as the people of Queensland are enjoy a one off public holiday . A few cars and buses are seen driving on the CBD streets, but most roads were empty . The Brisbane City Council's G20 chair Julian Simmonds encouraged people to visit South Bank, the botanic gardens or the city mall . World leaders have begun arriving in Brisbane with as many as 4000 delegates and 3000 reporters from around the globe expected to attend the half a billion dollar two-day gathering. The summit has been criticised as an expensive talkfest but Queensland's Tourism Minister Jann Stuckey says it's a rare opportunity to showcase Brisbane and Queensland to a power international audience. 'The economic benefit is estimated to be around $100 million but I believe it will far exceed that when we look at the long lasting legacy,' she told reporters at the G20 international media centre at South Bank on Thursday. 'When you have an international conference you are writing business for years to come.' From Friday Brisbane will on Friday transform from the laid back capital of Queensland to the temporary home of some of the most powerful people in the world. Police officers patrol a fence line around the Brisbane Convention and Exhibitions Centre (BCEC) on Friday . Many roads have been totally blocked off by police to increase security ahead of the arrival of world leaders . Many of the G20 leaders will jet in throughout the day, including the presidents of China, Indonesia, India and South Korea, the prime ministers of the UK, Canada and Japan, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. But it will be the arrival of Russian President Vladimir Putin that is bound to attract most attention. His visit is highly contentious due to Russia's role in the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over Ukraine in July. A total of 298 people, including 38 Australian citizens and residents, were killed in the disaster. Prime Minister Tony Abbott - who last month said he would 'shirtfront' Mr Putin on the MH17 issue - has already had one tense encounter with the Russian leader this week at the APEC summit in Beijing, and another is expected this weekend at the annual G20 summit. A police helicopter is seen flying over the CBD on Friday, with the G20 Summit set to officially kick off on Saturday . Police man a barricade outside the Brisbane Convention Centre ahead of the G-20 conference in Brisbane on Friday . Mr Putin will likely receive a hostile welcome from everyday Australians as well, with at least one anti-Putin protest planned for Saturday. Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations president Stefan Romaniw has called on other G20 leaders to show their disapproval of Russia's actions by imposing sanctions on the country and stripping it of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. 'He needs to be hit hard, to be ostracised in that (G20) meeting and feel the full brunt of the international community,' he said. The last of the leaders arrive on Saturday, with US President Barack Obama and his huge entourage landing early in the morning.

"Many people judge themselves harshly against others. But scientists claim we could better learn to accept ourselves, and ultimately boost our self-confidence, with the help of a virtual reality ‘avatar’. Experts say that receiving therapy in a virtual reality world, using a computer generated image of yourself, reduces self-criticism and boosts self-compassion and feels of contentment. Experts say receiving therapy in a virtual reality world using a computer generated image of yourself reduces self-criticism and boosts self-compassion. On the left, a woman wears the virtual reality kit. The right-hand image is how the participant sees the virtual world, from a first-person perspective . They think the tool could one day be used to treat a range of clinical conditions, including depression. A team of psychologists and computer scientists from University College London (UCL), the University of Barcelona and University of Derby came up with the concept of a self-to-self situation using avatars and computer game technology. Virtual reality has previously been used to treat psychological disorders including phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder, but this research focused on a new application for promoting emotional well-being. The study, which was published in Plos One, examined how 43 healthy, but self-critical women, experienced the world through a life-size virtual version of themselves. This gave a first person perspective of a virtual room through the eyes of the avatar. The participants were all trained to express compassion towards a distressed virtual child while in their adult virtual body. The participants were all trained to express compassion towards a distressed virtual child while in their adult virtual body. In the left-hand picture a view of the participant giving her compassion intervention, seen from the child's point of view. A third person view of the scenario is shown on the right . As they talked to the crying child, it appeared to listen and respond positively to their words and gestures. After a few minutes, 22 of the participants entered the body of the virtual child so they could see their virtual body double deliver their own compassionate words and gestures to themselves. The remaining 21 participants observed their original virtual adult body express compassion to the child from a third person perspective. Scientists looked at the participants’ mood and personality traits before and after the experiment. Professor Mel Slater of UCL and ICREA-University of Barcelona said: ‘When you wear a head-mounted display and look down towards yourself and see a virtual body replacing and moving like your own and also see it in a mirror, this gives a powerful clue to the brain that this is your body.’ Dr Caroline Falconer, also of UCL, said: ‘Women who experienced a first person perspective through the eyes of the virtual child were soothed - they felt safe and content and had increased self-compassion and a lower level of self-criticism. Scientists think that their virtual reality therapy technique could one day be used to treat a range of clinical conditions, including depression, where sufferers are often very self-critical . ‘For these women, we created a unique situation where they can have a kind and reassuring word with themselves. Excessive self-criticism plays a prominent role in the development and persistence of many mental health problems, including depression. The scientists said people who are self-compassionate tend to have lower levels of self-criticism and are more able to cope with negative life events because they are more able to cultivate a positive mood. Professor Chris Brewin of UCL, who lead the study, said the team is now conducting an in-depth clinical study to measure how long the technique’s benefits last in both healthy and depressed people. ‘If positive, we hope virtual reality-based therapy will become a viable, low-cost treatment people can use in their own home - something we believe is achievable using commercial gaming technology,’ he said .","Team of psychologists led by UCL developed a self-to-self situation using avatars and computer game technology to boost self-compassion .

"Some premature babies should start school a year late to give their brains time to develop, experts have claimed. The call follows a study which found that boys and girls born early are 50 per cent more likely to fail the reading, writing and maths tests given at the end of their second year in school. Children born before 37 weeks of pregnancy are also more likely to be diagnosed as having dyslexia, deafness and other problems that class them as having special educational needs. Struggling: A study found many of the learning difficulties experienced by premature children are simply due to them starting school too early . However, the Bristol University study found that some of their learning difficulties are simply due to them starting school too early. Campaigners argue that if they started school on the date they were due to be born, rather than the date they actually arrived, they would do better. Children in England generally start school in the September after their fourth birthday. This means that a child born several weeks prematurely on August 31 would begin a year earlier than they would have if they had been carried to full-term. The researchers analysed medical and education information gathered on almost 12,000 children born in the Bristol area.  More than 700 were born prematurely. Overall, the premature children were more likely to do badly in the tests given at the end of the second year of primary school. Campaigners argue that if children started school on the date they were due to be born, rather than the date they actually arrived, they would do better . Plus, 35 per cent had special educational needs.  This compares with the 23 per cent of their full-term classmates. Strikingly, the study found that those children who were born close to cut-off date for staring school – and so started their education earlier than they would have otherwise done – did worse. This suggests their problems weren’t solely caused by damage done by their early birth.  Instead their brains were still maturing and they might have done better if they’d started school later. Researcher Dr David Odd said that up to one in six premature babies start school early. He said: ‘It is easy to look at a premature child’s date of birth and think that is how old they are but they are not that old. ‘These children are going to school in some cases a year earlier than they would have done. ‘Development doesn’t speed up just because you are born earlier.  They still have to go through all the developmental stages.’ The study, published in the journal PLoS ONEalso showed that it was not just very premature babies that suffer, with some of those born just five or six weeks early doing badly when starting school. Previous research has shown that summer-born children, who, like some premature babies, are young for their year, do worse at school and are less likely to get a place at university. Wendy Ellyat, of the Save Childhood Movement, which believes children are being pushed into formal education too young, said: ‘It is now evident that not only are summer-born children particularly disadvantaged by an early start to formal learning but also pre-term infants – and we show that such early disadvantage is likely to then impact onto the whole of their school lives.’ Sir Al Aynsley-Green, a retired professor of child health and a former Children’s Commissioner for England, said: ‘Education experts must look at these data and argue for a change in policy so that the school entry age for children born prematurely is based on their expected due date rather than their premature date of birth.’ However, Dr Odd said that more research is needed to rule out possibilities such as premature children being stigmatised or bullied if they start school late.",Bristol University study finds that some learning difficulties are due to premature children starting school too early .
"The brother of Olympic wrestling champion Dave Schultz, who was shot dead in 1996 by multimillionaire John du Pont, has said it has taken him 18 years to come to terms with his brother’s senseless murder. Foxcatcher is a Hollywood film that tells the incredible true story of Mark Schultz and his brother’s strange relationship with du Pont which ended when the eccentric philanthropist shot Dave Schultz dead on the driveway of his 800-acre farm in Delaware County, Pennsylvania. The film, based on Mark's newly released memoir, is out this week and stars Channing Tatum as Mark, Steve Carell as du Pont, and Mark Ruffalo as Dave. The memoir of Mark Schultz, left with Channing Tatum, tells the story of his brother Dave Schultz's, top right, tragic murder at the hands of John du Pont in 1996 . Olympic wrestling champion Dave Schultz, left, who was shot dead in 1996 by multimillionaire John du Pont, is played in the movie by Mark Ruffalo . ‘I decided to write my autobiography because I didn’t want Dave to be forgotten,’ Mark Schultz, now 54, of Medford, Ore., told the New York Post. ‘It was a tough decision for me as I’ve always been a man of few words.’ The film, and Mark’s book, tells the incredible true story of how these championship-winning brothers managed to fall in with the wealthiest convicted murderer of all time. It starts in the mid-80s when du Pont approached Mark Schultz, an Olympic gold medalist and world champion, and invited him to his Foxcatcher Farms estate to  put together a wrestling team for future Olympics. Mark, who says his opportunities at the time were limited, jumped at the chance although he now says he regretted the decision almost immediately after. ‘Looking back, I should have trusted my gut and never let him into my life - or, indeed, the life of my brother a few years later,’ said Schultz. Olympic wrestling champion Mark Schultz, left, is played in the film Foxcatcher by Channing Tatum, right . Foxcatcher, based on Mark Schultz's newly released memoir, is out this week and stars Channing Tatum as Mark, Steve Carell as du Pont, and Mark Ruffalo as Dave . ‘Everything about him was weird, from the dyed red Ronald McDonald hair with layers of dandruff in the roots to his dark yellow teeth, caked with food. Within weeks of working for him, I realized I’d made a huge mistake.’ Despite his bad feeling, the two men formed an odd bond that was a mixture of friendship and unspoken sexual tension, but ultimately du Pont’s erratic moods became too much for Schultz and he walked out in 1988. ‘I couldn’t look myself in the mirror and continue to work for du Pont or live on his estate. That was his whole strategy in his friendships and business relationships - to see how much money people would accept from him and how much they’d compromise themselves,’ said Schultz. To replace him, du Pont simply turned to Schultz’s older brother Dave who also had an Olympic gold medal and world title to his name. Tragedy stuck on January 26, 1996, when John du Pont shot Dave Schultz three times at close range on the grounds of his 800-acre Foxcatcher farm in Delaware County, Pennsylvania . In 1989, Dave Schultz and his young family moved into a house on the grounds of the Foxcatcher estate. Du Pont’s erratic behaviour continued to deteriorate and tragedy struck on January 26, 1996, when he shot Dave Schultz three times at close range. The murder was witnessed by Schultz's wife and du Pont's head of security and afterwards the multimillionaire locked himself inside his mansion for two days. Police negotiated with him on the phone before switching off his power and eventually arresting him when he ventured outside to fix his heater. ‘When my dad called to tell me that Dave had been killed, I threw the phone and destroyed everything in my office,’ said Mark. ‘Then, I curled into a ball and cried. I must have cried for a week.’ Steve Carell stars as eccentric philanthropist John du Pont in the movie . Du Pont, who was found to be mentally ill but not insane, was convicted in 1997 of murdering Dave Schult and died in prison in 2010 . No motive was ever offered for the murder, although friends had noted Du Pont was acting erratically beforehand, and an expert witness testified he was a paranoid schizophrenic who thought Schultz was going to kill him. Du Pont, who was found to be mentally ill but not insane, was convicted in 1997 of murdering Dave Schult in the third degree after the court rejected his plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. He died of acute aspiration pneumonia in prison in 2010, aged 72. Now 18 years later, Mark Schultz says the process of writing his memoir and working on the film has helped him come to terms with his brother's death. ‘I spent nearly a week on set. Watching Steve Carell play du Pont was like coming face-to-face again with the man who broke our family’s heart,' he said. Mark Schultz's memoir Foxcatcher and the motion picture staring Steve Carell, Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo are both out this week .","Foxcatcher tells the story of Olympic wrestling champion Dave Schultz being shot dead by multimillionaire John du Pont in 1996 .

Officials announced Mark Foley's resignation as Granby Memorial Middle School principal on Wednesday. Superintendent Alan Addley says Foley did nothing illegal. But he says Foley acknowledged that his movies became a 'distraction' and he didn't want continuing media coverage to distract students, parents or staff from academic work. Caught: Dr. Mark Foley (right), a middle school principal has resigned, whilst Aaron Vnuk (left), a seventh-grade guidance counselor, has returned to work at his school despite producing sexually charged horror pics . School officials say Foley and Aaron Vnuk, a seventh-grade guidance counselor in Windsor, ran a movie production company called Moongoyle Entertainment, which had a motto of 'fresh blood, hot babes, cool flicks.' Foley and Vnuk were placed on administrative leave last month while school officials looked into their movie-making. Vnuk has since returned to his job. Many defended the educators, saying they should be free to pursue any side interest, so long as those pursuits were not illegal and did not involve students. However others expressed outrage maintaining that educators should be held to a higher standard, and that any work that objectifies women is incompatible with leading or counseling middle school students. The school has since released a statement: 'The Granby Board of Education has accepted the resignation of Dr. Mark Foley from his position as Principal of Granby Memorial Middle school,' Granby superintendent Dr. Alan Addley said. 'Dr. Foley has served successfully as Middle School Principal since July 2013; however, Dr. Foley acknowledges the distraction caused by the recent publicity concerning his involvement in Moongoyle Entertainment LLC.' Double life: The two produced multiple films, as well as running a site featuring women in lingerie and posing in sexually provocative ways . Among the titles produced by the duo were Mind Morgue, The Limb Collector, Demon of Castlebury, and The Bard of Blood. The two also made a full-nudity flick, Slicing Beauty. That film stars Kerri Taylor who 'bares all as a kinky serial killer who loves to give her victims a satisfying but often morbid peep show.' Foley, 45, worked under the pseudonym Mark Daniel, while Vnuk, 39, went by Aaron Thomas Howell. The two began making films together in 2008, meeting when Foley was vice principal at Windsor's Sage. They formed a company that became Moongoyle Entertainment, with a website that includes the tagline, 'Fresh Blood. Hot Babes. Cool Pics.' One shot on the site shows a woman dressed as a provocative schoolgirl. Scream queen: Kerri Taylor, above, stars in the film Slicing Beauty, which was produced by Foley and Vnuk . Femme fatale: It is said that in the film, Taylor's character 'bares all as a kinky serial killer who loves to give her victims a satisfying but often morbid peep show' The pair also released a calendar featuring Moongoyle Web hostess Violett Wolfe posing in lingerie that was 'popular with prison inmates' according to their Facebook page. The Moongoyle site and YouTube channel have been taken down in the aftermath of the controversy. 'Put in the context of a school, then it's not appropriate,' Foley said last monthweek. 'But there is no overlap there, that's the thing to keep in mind. This is not being done at school or anything.' He also made it clear that none of his films ever used one of his, or Vnuk's, current or former students. In late October, Vnuk accepted a two-week suspension and remains a guidance counselor at Sage Park Middle School. He also agreed to refrain from involvement in films that contain nudity and violent horror themes while employed at the school. Out of work: Granby Middle School in Granby, Connecticut, where Foley worked .

"A new database that was built to map the inter-migration of Americans has shown how the Midwest, above all over areas, has lost the greatest amount of people since the 1950s. With an average of 10 million Americans moving to a different county each year, researchers at the University of Wisconsin, Michigan Technological University and the University of New Hampshire have used Census statistics over the decades to track net changes in population from each county across the country. The results graph much of what history has already told us, such as the Great Migration of blacks from the south and the white flight to northern suburbs. However the most significant consistency is the exodus of people from the Midwest and the Great Plains, largely due to the hollowing out of the Rust Belt cities, the rise of the Sun Belt and brain drain. Orange represents a move of at least five people, while purple shows a net increase of 20 people per 100 individuals. Today: This map, graphing the increase and decrease in migration to different areas, encompasses the 2000 decade. Orange represents a loss of five people or more, while purple measures 20 net migrants per 100 individuals. As you can see the Midwest and the Great Plains have experienced the greatest loss . Back in the 1950s, migration growth was centered around California, New York and Florida. It also shows the intensity of the Midwest area that would become known as the Rust Belt, which was booming with industry at the time . The Rust Belt refers to the region that was once the hub of America's industrial sector but faced a steep decline after much of the manufacturing was transferred to the Southeast, an increase in automation and the decline of the US steel and coal industries. It encapsulates the areas around Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana and the Lower Peninsula of Michigan, ending in northern Illinois and eastern Wisconsin. As the maps show, the Midwest enjoyed a boom in the 1950s and 1960s thanks to industrialization, becoming a migration mecca. However as the 1970s map shows, there was a mass exodus from major Midwestern cities like Chicago, Detroit and Cleveland, as people moved to set up in the less-established surrounding counties and cities. Wayne County (Detroit) lost 26.6 percent of its white population in the 1970s. Cook County (Chicago) lost 15.5 percent, and Cuyahoga County (Cleveland) 20.1 percent, according to The Atlantic Cities. 1960s: The Midwest begins to lose people to the South, specifically Texas and its northern states . 1970s: America booms. Almost all areas outside of the Great Plains and the Midwest experience major increases in migration . 1980's: : Following the boom of the 1970's, the decade after was steeped in recession, with most the country suffering a loss. Nevada became the fastest growing US state, reaching a population of 1.2 million by 1990 . 1990's: Following the recession of the 1980's, America is revitalized, with even the Midwest enjoying a spike in migration . Despite a spike in the 1990s, mostly . around Chicago, that decline has been steady since, with many younger . people relocating to places like San Diego, Austin and Atlanta. The 1970's also marked the rise of Texas and a popularity among surrounding states like Oklahoma, Arkansas and Missouri. There was also a strong growth all over Florida. In the 1980's, Nevada emerged as the fastest growing US state. Despite strong competition from Atlantic City, which had introduced almost-identical gaming laws in the late seventies, Nevada continued to increase. By 1990, it measured a population of 1.2 million, with many contributing the number to the opening of The Mirage in 1989, which at the time was the greatest casino Las Vegas, if not the world, had seen.

"With its ghostly pallid fur, near-transparent skin and razor-sharp teeth, the ghost bat is one animal that's difficult to imagine snuggling up to. Otherwise known as the 'false vampire bat', the Australian native is under threat from the man-made loss of habitats, prompting a bid by preservationists to save the vulnerable animal before it's too late. Last month, Taronga Zoo was celebrating after it's new breeding program for the vulnerable animal led to the first successful birth of a ghost bat pup in 15 years. Scroll down for video . The Ghost Bat pup born at Taronga Zoo in Sydney, which is is the first to be born in 15 years as part of a regional breeding program established to protect the vulnerable species . Otherwise known as the false vampire, the Australian native is under threat due to the man-made loss of habitats, prompting a bid by preservationists to save the vulnerable bat before it's too late . The pup is the first to come from the Zoo's newest breeding pair Celeste and Nocturne, and an encouraging sign for the regional breeding program. Ghost Bats, Australia's only carnivorous bat, are endangered by the loss of feeding habitats and the destruction of caves and mine shafts. 'They are particularly vulnerable to mining, which can threaten their maternity caves,' said Wendy Gleen, a Taronga zookeeper. Once spread extensively throughout the country, scientists have found the animal is now dispersed into small pockets of population, which gravely raises the threat of extinction. The birth of the animal provides a great opportunity for visitors to see the elusive creature up close. 'Ghost Bats are difficult to spot in the wild, as they often live in complete darkness and hide in remote caves,' Ms Gleen said. 'They've got the most amazing facial structures and use echolocation to find their way in the dark. Our modern sonar systems could probably learn a thing or two from these bats' natural talents.' The pup is already on display at the Zoo's Australian Nightlife exhibition, though it remains to be named, since keepers have not yet determined its gender. 'The pup has been clinging to its mother for warmth and security, clutching onto her neck with its back legs,' said Ms Gleen. Sharp-eyed visitors may be able to spot the pup at the very end of the walkthrough at Taronga's Australian Nightlife exhibit.

"Schoolchildren who constantly feel they are the smartest in the class tend to be disliked by their fellow pupils, researchers have found. Researchers found the more one student feels unrealistically superior to another, the less they are liked. They say it explains the stigma attached to being a 'nerd'. The Big Bang Theory with Jim Parsons as Sheldon Cooper. Schoolchildren who constantly feel they are the smartest in the class tend to be disliked by their fellow pupils, researchers have found. Using a round-robin design, the researchers asked each student to rate their classmates, in terms of their likability and of their feelings of academic superiority (i.e. rating on a scale ''I feel academically superior to him/her''). They the contrasted those ratings with the students' grades in math, physics, German, and English. Importantly, they conducted the analysis at two different social levels: 'habitual' - the way people act in general - and 'relationship' - the way someone acts around a specific individual. November 12, 2014 - 'I am the smartest kid in class.' We all want our kids to be self-confident, but unrealistic perceptions of their academic abilities can be harmful. In fact, unrealistic views, a new study of eighth-graders finds, can damage the a child's relationship with others in the classroom. 'There is more to being labeled a nerd than just academic achievement,' said Katrin Rentzsch of the University of Bamberg in Germany, who led the research. 'I really got interested in the question of whether it is OK to brag about achievements in class or if you should rather not display your achievements in the classroom.' The research looked at something psychologists call 'self-enhancement' - when a person feels unrealistically superior to someone else. The poster child for self-enhancement is the character Sheldon on The Big Bang Theory. 'Although Sheldon is a smart person and receives respect for his scientific work, he still thinks that he is even smarter, brighter, or much better as compared to how he is perceived by others,' says Rentzsch, who is currently a visiting scholar at Stanford University. Rentzsch and her colleague Michela Schröder-Abé decided to take a closer look at how such self-enhancement affects relationships. They turned to an eighth-grade classroom to measure differences between actual academic performance, students' perceptions of their performance, and social popularity. The 358 students came from 20 eighth-grade classes in schools in southeast Germany. Using a round-robin design, the researchers asked each student to rate their classmates, in terms of their likability and of their feelings of academic superiority (i.e. rating on a scale ''I feel academically superior to him/her''). They the contrasted those ratings with the students' grades in math, physics, German, and English.

The Big Bang Theory with Stephen Hawking and Jim Parsons as Sheldon Cooper. The research looked at something psychologists call 'self-enhancement' - when a person feels unrealistically superior to someone else. The differences between these two levels of analysis were stark: Students who tended to have an inflated view of themselves at the habitual level were neither more or less liked by their classmates. However, self-inflation toward specific individuals changed how the students felt about each other. 'The more a student felt unrealistically superior to a specific other student, the less he or she was liked by the other student in return,' wrote the researchers in a new study in Social Psychological and Personality Science. Interestingly, at both the habitual and relationship levels, students who self-enhanced disliked their classmates more than those with more realistic views of themselves. The results show, Rentzsch says, that 'the specific relationship between individuals matters when it comes to the social consequences of self-enhancement.' When a person acts superior to someone else specifically, it can be offensive, whereas if someone has an inflated sense of themselves all the time toward everyone, it feels less personal, they say.","Authors cite big Bang Theory's Sheldon Cooper as 'poster boy'

"A teenage brother and sister have been jailed for orchestrating a 'revenge rape' on a young girl after telling her: 'snitches get stitches'. Aliyah Weekes, 19, instigated a sex attack carried out by her younger brother in an alleyway on the 15-year-old victim, who she accused of spreading rumours. She was sentenced to four-and-a-half years' detention in a young offenders institute today for her role in what a judge called a 'truly wicked' crime. Her 18-year-old brother Lacquan Weekes, who carried out the attack, was detained for five years at the Old Bailey after he was found guilty of rape following a trial. Aliyah Weekes (left) forced a 15-year-old girl to perform a sex act on her brother, Lacquan (right), as part of a 'revenge rape' after she claimed the victim 'spread stories' about her . Aliyah Weekes and a 16-year-old girl were also convicted of aiding and abetting the attack. The youngest defendant was spared a custodial sentence and given a youth rehabilitation order for 18 months. Sentencing the trio, Judge Jeremy Donne said: 'This was no game. This was no childish folly. This was a wicked crime and one that Aliyah Weekes, you determined upon over the space of about an hour during which the victim was detained.' The sex attack happened after the victim confronted by the two girls in a park in Willesden, north-west London in April. The victim was forced into an alleyway and made to perform a sex act on Lacquan Weekes, while a group of youths watched nearby. Judge Donne said: 'This was a revenge rape and this poor girl was being punished. She was accused of spreading stories. Her explanations were rejected. 'She was very distressed throughout this. She must have been terrified. To compound her fear was the added humiliation that all of this was happening before a group of other youths who were nearby. This was a truly wicked offence.' The judge said he held Aliyah Weekes 'principally responsible' for the incident, which he said would not have happened without her involvement. She had told the victim 'snitches get stitches' when she accused the victim of telling secrets about her and the 16-year-old. The victim was also threatened with being put through an even more horrific ordeal. The judge said  Aliyah Weekes was 'principally responsible' and the court heard Lacquan Weekes poses a 'high risk to the public . In an impact statement, the victim's mother said she had changed from a 'bubbly and carefree' girl to being 'jumpy and withdrawn' with a 'lack of confidence and trust in people'. Her family had also been targeted in 'acts of intimidation' including having a brick thrown through their window, the court heard. Lacquan Weekes, of north-west London, smiled and chatted to his sister in the dock as the court heard that he poses a 'high risk' to the public. The judge said Lacquan Weekes, who has previous convictions for battery and possession of drugs, had shown 'not one iota of remorse' for the crime and said his behaviour while on remand had been 'appalling'. Paul Stanislas, for Aliyah Weekes, also from north-west London, said she had played 'no more' than an 'instigator role' in the attack. Michael Chambers, for her brother, said he had a 'very troubled background'. Clare Gordon, representing the youngest defendant, said she neither 'perpetrated nor instigated' the incident. The confrontation happened on a patch of grass outside the College of North West London campus in Willesden, north-west London (pictured) before the girl was led to an alley.

"Crook: Chaudry Ali could face another decade in prison if he does not repay £4.3m in criminal gains . A '24-carat' smuggler who brought £100million worth of gold into Britain must repay £4.3million of the tax he dodged - or spend an extra decade in prison. Chaudry Ali, 52, was jailed for nine years in 2012 for spearheading an international smuggling ring which took precious metals from  Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. Using an elaborate system of couriers, he swapped bags with his fellow smugglers in Frankfurt to avoid £9million in VAT because the tax is not payable within the EU. Chiefs at HM Revenue and Customs branded him a '24-carat criminal' when the scam was finally foiled two years ago. Images from the raid showed a laptop bag stuffed with gold jewellery including hundreds of bangles and bracelets. The total resale value of all the gold he brought into Britain was estimated at £100million. His trial heard he had benefited to the tune of £7million - but forensic accounting later raised that figure to £9million,  HMRC said. A judge has now ruled Ali must repay half of that figure - and the deadline has been set at four months. If he does not pay it back, another ten years will be added to his sentence. Making the order, Judge Paul Dodgson said Ali still denied his guilt - but had been 'a dishonest witness who was quite prepared to lie in the face of overwhelming evidence.' An HMRC spokesman insisted the figure was  half of Ali's ill-gotten gains because the law states authorities can only claim assets which a criminal actually has. 'If in the future he comes into money we can go back to court', a spokesman said. 'Just because he's only having to pay back half it doesn't mean he will never have to pay the rest back. It's a life-long thing.' During the original investigation, it was discovered Ali had organised 120 scam trips between January 2007 and April 2008, importing huge quantities of gold into Britain without paying tax. A courier would leave Britain in the afternoon, arriving in Dubai early the next morning. 24-carat criminal: Some of the gold bangles and bracelets smuggled by Chaudry Ali, who used couriers swapping bags in Frankfurt to avoid VAT because the tax isn't paid on imports from within the EU . They would collect the gold before leaving Dubai the same evening and returning to Britain via Frankfurt, Germany, where they met Ali in an airside lounge. They would then swap bags – so Ali would leave with the gold and the courier would leave with an ordinary bag of clothes. The pair would then take separate flights back to the UK, passing through the European Union (EU) entry channel. In case he was stopped by officers, Ali carried forged paperwork which claimed he was a legitimate VAT-registered gold trader who had travelled to Europe with the gold in his bag. But as he hadn’t left the EU, no duty would be payable on the gold. Ali, of Hillingdon, west London, denied all involvement in the scheme when his case came to court in late 2012. But a jury at Kingston Crown Court in south west London found him guilty of conspiracy to cheat the public revenue, and he was jailed. Two alleged couriers were charged and stood trial, but a jury found them not guilty. Heaps: The gold was worth tens of millions of pounds - as the amount of VAT avoided alone was around £7m . Crammed: Jubilant customs officials released these photos of Ali's laptop bag after his conviction in 2012 . HMRC investigator Kevin Newe said: 'Ali believed he had found the perfect fraud that was beyond detection, but he was wrong. 'Our investigators uncovered the fraud and addition to his current prison term, he will have to spend an extra ten years in jail unless he repays crime profits of over £4.3million within the next four months. 'Our work doesn't stop with sentencing - we will pursue criminal profits to reclaim them for the taxpayer and the UK economy.' Andrew Sackey, Assistant Director, Criminal Investigation for HMRC, said previously: 'Chaudry Ali was a 24-carat criminal. He systematically evaded millions of pounds of VAT in the hope of lining his pockets. 'Our officers worked tirelessly to catch him, and the sentence is the result of that hard work.'","Chuadry Ali, 52, was jailed for nine years in 2012 for massive VAT fraud .

"Jordan Higgins (pictured), son of former world champion Alex Higgins, has been jailed for 18 months after admitting robbery . The son of former world snooker champion Alex 'Hurricane' Higgins has been jailed today for carrying out a dawn robbery on a newsagents. Jordan Higgins, 31, was high on drink and drugs when he snatched a haul of cigarettes worth £1,500 from a display shelf after he and a masked accomplice burst into the shop  in Cheadle, Greater Manchester. During the attack Higgins stormed round the back of the counter and grabbed Steven Gee by the throat and pushed him onto a stool. He then emptied the cigarettes off the shelves into a duvet cover before running off and escaping in a getaway car. He was arrested after his DNA was matched to the crime scene. The robbery last January occurred after Higgins - who has a string of convictions - battled a lengthy drug and alcohol problem during which he was admitted to a rehabilitation clinic at the age of just 14. He was also said to have struggled living in the shadow of his late father who died aged 61 in 2010 after battling throat cancer. At Minshull Street Crown Court today, the late snooker star's former wife Lynn and daughter Lauren wept in the public gallery as Jordan - who was given the middle name Alexander - was locked away for 18 months after admitting robbery. Sentencing Judge John Potter told him: 'Regrettably this is not the first time you find yourself standing in the dock of a criminal court for a criminal offence. 'You do have previous convictions recorded against you which I have considered carefully including previous for alcohol, causing loss to others by way of damage and assault. 'You knew what was going on and knew the robbery was to take place. You have targeted somebody simply trying to earn a living. 'He was alone so was vulnerable. You ran away and as you did you discarded your scarf and glove and further analysis on the DNA was recovered linking you to the commission of the offence. 'I accept your remorse is now genuine and at the time you were riddled with the associated difficulties and problems that alcohol and drug addiction brings to people but as you know that is absolutely no excuse for your behaviour. 'I accept you are somebody who has had a difficult upbringing and you have had to live in the glare of publicity with a father, that according to the testimonials, was hardly the proper role model to a son. 'But that is also no excuse to target Mr Gee as you did. I view this so serious only immediate custody is appropriate.' Earlier Andrew Long prosecuting said the robbery began when Higgins, from Cheadle, and his accomplice drew up in a car and burst in wearing scarves over their faces. Tragedy: Alex Higgins, left and right, is considered one of the snooker greats, but he struggled with drinking, gambling, and drug use until his death in 2010 . He added: 'The defendant grabbed Mr Gee by the throat and walked him backwards squeezing his throat and dragged him to a stool behind the counter. 'The two men then set about trying to steal the cigarettes. The other man got a duvet and put the cigarettes in and both men pulled the shelf off the display and took it towards the car. 'Mr Gee pressed the silent alarm and when they left the shop he locked them out. They left the shop with the tray, leaving the duvet behind with around £1,500 of cigarettes. 'They got back in the car and drove away at speed but crashed it. The defendant was the passenger in the car which was bearing false registration plates. 'The two men ran through the gardens and the police were able to follow where some items were discarded including the scarf worn by the defendant. The passenger side airbag was also deployed. The glove, mask and airbag had the defendant's DNA on.' Jordan Higgins was high on drink and drugs when he snatched a haul of cigarettes worth £1,500 from a display shelf after he and a masked accomplice burst into the shop (pictured) in Cheadle, Greater Manchester . In mitigation defence counsel Estelle Parkhouse said: 'He was under the influence of drugs and alcohol and the CCTV demonstrates this is a less sophisticated robbery. 'He wasn't thinking very clearly. Prior to Christmas he lost the employment he had for three years and in addition his long term relationship had broken down. 'He then started using drugs and alcohol to block out the difficulties. She added: 'He has lived in the shadow of his father's fame and success and unfortunately it has been a life of constant scrutiny. The pressures placed upon him have been difficult to bear. At 14 years old he went to the Priory for misuse of alcohol. 'After that, unfortunately, his misuse escalated and he started using Class A drugs. This offence is wholly out of character. She went on to explain how he had led a 'troubled childhood that was 'far from a charmed existence. During the attack Jordan Higgins stormed round the back of the counter and grabbed Steven Gee (pictured) by the throat and pushed him onto a stool . 'His father's behaviour is described in the letters by his sister and mum. He was exposed to alcohol and drugs from an early age and has an addictive personality but since the offence he has addressed his problem with drugs. 'He has a very close relationship with his mother and sister and an incredibly close relationship with his grandparents who are in their 80s. 'His grandfather was by far a more appropriate father figure than his father was. This offence wasn't committed because he needed money but he can't provide an explanation as to why he got involved. He is disgusted by his behaviour and is genuinely sorry for the harm caused.' After the case Mr Gee, 51, described the 'very scary' experience of being robbed in his shop. 'I didn't know if they had weapons or if they were prepared to really hurt me or what. The police were here within minutes but I was very shaken up,' he said. 'I was very surprised more than anything when I heard who it was who did it. Unfortunately the way his dad's life panned out could have affected this young man. Losing any loved one affects people differently. In a way I feel sorry for him.' Jordan was born a year after his father - who came to be known as 'The People's Champion' - won the World Snooker Championship in 1982 during which the star sobbed as he hugged then-wife Lynne and one-year-old daughter Lauren. The Hurricane had already been World Champion and runner-up in 1976 and 1980. He won the UK Championship in 1983 and the Masters in 1978 and 1981, making him one of nine players to have completed snooker's Triple Crown. He was also World Doubles champion with Jimmy White in 1984, and won the World Cup three times with the All Ireland team. Jordan was born a year after his father - who came to be known as 'The People's Champion' - famously won the World Snooker Championship in 1982. Alex Higgins is pictured next to his daughter and wife Lynn . But tragically Higgins snr's career subsequently crumbled under a litany of fines, bans and court-cases. He was left penniless after losing his luxury house in Cheshire to the taxman and was eventually stopped from seeing Jordan and Lauren following his divorce with Lynn. He was a heavy smoker, struggled with drinking and gambling and admitted to using cocaine and marijuana. Diagnosed with throat cancer in 1998, Higgins died of the illness in his Belfast home on 24 July 2010. Jordan was a pallbearer at his father's funeral alongside snooker stars Jimmy White and Ken Doherty.","Jordan Higgins, 31, and accomplice robbed shop in Cheadle, Manchester .

"It is a row almost every couple has had - is one sex better at reading maps than the other? Researchers say the now believe the answer is yes - and say they know why. Scientists studying African tribes say men evolved better spatial abilities so they could roam further in the pursuit of mates. Men who did better on a spatial task not only traveled farther than other men but also had children with more women, the Utah researchers found. There is a demonstrated relationship between sex differences in how far some mammals – including voles and deer mice – range or travel, and sex differences in their spatial and navigation abilities. But until now, little has been known about this relationship in humans. The University of Utah study tested and interviewed dozens of members of the Twe and Tjimba tribes in northwest Namibia. They found that men who did better on a spatial task not only traveled farther than other men but also had children with more women, according to the study published this week in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior. 'It's the first time anybody has tried to draw a line between spatial ability, navigation, range size and reproductive success,' said Layne Vashro, the study's author. 'Navigation ability facilitates traveling longer distances and exploring new environments. 'And the farther you travel, the more likely you are to encounter new mating opportunities.' There is a demonstrated relationship between sex differences in how far some mammals – including voles and deer mice – range or travel, and sex differences in their spatial and navigation abilities. But until now, little has been known about this relationship in humans, Vashro claims. 'Among the most consistent sex differences found in the psychological literature are spatial ability and navigation ability, with men better at both.' 'In the anthropological literature, one of the most consistent behavioral differences between men and women is the distance they travel. 'This difference in traveling is assumed to explain the observed differences in spatial ability and navigation ability. 'Now, we've drawn a link between spatial ability and range size.' 'Most of this chain has been assumed in the scientific literature,'Anthropology professor Elizabeth Cashdan, the study's senior author, says, . 'Some of the links have been demonstrated, but this study looks at the whole chain and that's what is novel about it.' University of Utah anthropologist Layne Vashro with a woman from the Twe tribe in Namibia as she performs a mental rotation task on a laptop computer. It was part of a new study that found evidence men evolved better navigation ability than women because men with better ability to manipulate objects in their mind can roam farther and have children with more mates. Cashdan says spatial skills include 'being able to visualize spatial relationships and manipulate that image in your mind.' Vashro says an example is to 'visualize how you fit a bunch of things into the back of a truck, and how you could rotate them most efficiently to fit.' She believes that relative to other cognitive differences between the sexes, such as cultural differences in math skills, the difference in spatial skills is large, and it is found across cultures and in some other species. 'That's why we think it may have evolutionary roots,' she says. 'The argument in the literature is that you need good spatial ability to navigate successfully, and you need to navigate effectively to travel long distances in unfamiliar environments,' Cashdan says. The new study connected links in that chain. 'These findings offer strong support for the relationship between sex differences in spatial ability and ranging behavior, and identify male mating competition as a possible selective pressure shaping this pattern,' the researchers conclude in their paper. The study involved members of the Twe (pronounced tway) and Tjimba (pronounced chim-bah) tribes, which live in a mountainous, semiarid desert area. They have some goats and cows, and they collect berries, tubers and honey, and tend gardens with maize and some melons and pumpkin, Vashro says. They have dry season camps in the mountains, where they forage, and wet season camps near their gardens. The Twe and Tjimba were good subjects for the study because they travel over distances of 120 miles during a year, 'navigating on foot in a wide-open natural environment like many of our ancestors,' Vashro says. A couple from Namibia's Twe tribe outside their home. University of Utah anthropologists studied the Twe and Tjimba people of Namibia in a study that linked better spatial skills in men to the distances over which they roam. The study indicated men evolved better navigation skills than women because it helps them find more mates and produce more offspring. The tribes 'have a comparatively open sexual culture,' Vashro says. Cashdan adds, 'They have a lot of affairs with people they're not married to, and this is accepted in the culture.' Many men have children by women other than their wives. That also made the tribes good for the study, because 'in a culture where you don't have mates outside of marriage, we're not going to expect as tight a relationship between range size and reproductive success,' Cashdan says. 'Men traveled father than women and to more places than women,' with both findings statistically significant, Cashdan says. On average, Vashro says, 'men reported visiting 3.4 unique locations across 30 miles per location on average in a year, while women reported visiting only two locations across 20 miles.' And in the key finding, men who did better on the mental rotation task reported traveling farther both during their lifetime and the past year, compared with men who didn't do as well on the mental rotation task. There was no difference in range size between women who did better and worse on the mental rotation task . During visits to Namibia's Kunene region during 2009-2011, Vashro had Twe and Tjimba participants perform different tasks. He looked for male-female differences and correlations among those differences: . - To test the ability to rotate objects mentally, a computer screen displayed a series of hands palm up or palm down and oriented in different directions. After a trial period, 68 men and 52 women were shown a series of hands for up to 7.5 seconds per image and were asked to identify whether the pictured hand was a left hand or right hand. After excluding participants who didn't understand the task, the Utah researchers found males did better. - Another test of spatial perception involved a picture of a clear plastic cup with a horizontal water line in the middle. It was shown to 67 men and 55 women. Then they were shown a single page with four images of the cup tipped and the water line at varying angles. They were asked to identify the correct image, which showed the water line in the tipped cup parallel to the ground. This task also has been shown to be easier for men and also may be related to certain navigation skills. In the new study, the men also were significantly better at it than the women. - In another test, 37 men and 36 women were asked to point to nine different locations in the Kunene region, ranging from about 8 to 80 miles away. Vashro used a GPS compass to measure their accuracy. Men scored significantly better than women. - The researchers also measured the range size of Twe and Tjimba people by interviewing them and asking how many places they visited during the past year and the distance they covered to get to each location. 'It looks like men who travel more in the past year also have children from more women – what you would expect if mating was the payoff for travel,' Vashro says. 'Why men should be better at mentally rotating objects is a weird thing,' Cashdan says. 'Some people think it is culturally constructed, but that doesn't explain why the pattern is shared so broadly across human societies and even in some other species. 'The question is why should men get better benefits from spatial ability than women? One hypothesis, which our data support, is that males, more than females, benefit reproductively from getting more mates, and ranging farther is one way they do this.'","Team studied members of the Twe and Tjimba tribes in northwest Namibia .

Daily Mail Australia has contacted the Victorian police for comment. Ice, also known as methamphetamine or crystal meth, has shot to the top of Australia's crime enforcement agenda, with the Australian Crime Commission declaring the country is in the grips of an ‘ice pandemic.’ The drug, which is highly addictive, can quickly cause brain damage comparable to Alzheimer’s disease, as well as violently psychotic behaviour and delusional paranoia. Police also believe the purity of the drug on streets in increasing, which is causing the onset and severity of it's harmful symptoms to skyrocket. In Victoria, the median purity level of ice bought on the streets has soared from 20 per cent two years ago to 76.1 per cent now.

Bikie gangs and other underworld syndicates are capitalising on the addictive nature of the drug by flooding the streets with ice, particularly in rural or suburban communities. Ice is particularly prominent in Victoria, where regional ambulance call outs for ice related incidents increased by 200 per cent in regional Victoria between 2012 and 2013. The accessibility of Ice has led some experts to compare it to the issue of crack-cocaine in America. Last month the Australian Drugs Conference was held in Melbourne, where community leaders from Geelong, Mildura and Swan Hillmet to discuss the best approach to tackling the spread of the drug.","The video comes from a train passing Hawthorne, east Melbourne .

"North Korean leader Kim Jong-un must face international justice for human rights abuses committed by the state that are comparable to atrocities committed in the Nazi era, a UN investigator said today. Marzuki Darusman, the UN special rapporteur on human rights in North Korea, said there was enough evidence of systematic torture, starvation and killings, to hold the isolated country's leader accountable. A UN inquiry concluded in a February 17 report that North Korean security chiefs and possibly even Kim himself should face international justice for ordering 'massive' human rights atrocities - including torture and starvation. Scroll down for video . Kim Jong-un, pictured, should face justice for 'massive' human rights atrocities, a UN investigator said today . The tyrant questions one of his advisors during one of his inspections across the country . Mr Darusman told a forum in Seoul that the report 'was able to point unequivocally to the responsibility and the culpability (for) these massive human rights violations to a single source of policy decision-making in the country. 'And therefore it's only now that we are in the position to in fact directly put culpability on the supreme leader for these massive human rights violations.' A resolution drafted by the European Union and Japan has urged North Korea's referral to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity - but it does not single Kim out by name. North Korea has dismissed the UN inquiry as part of an American plot aimed at destroying the country's political system. In recent months, the country's diplomats have also been on a vigorous campaign to counter the moves to drag North Korea to the ICC. Mr Darusman added: 'That, perhaps, has somewhat agitated the North Korean delegation.' The draft resolution could go to a UN General Assembly committee that deals with human rights as early as next week. A photo released by the country's tightly-controlled media outlets shows a battalion of troops in Pyongyang . If approved, it will be put to a vote at the General Assembly in December. Only the 15-member Security Council can refer the situation in North Korea to the ICC, but diplomats say China, North Korea's main benefactor, would likely veto such a move. Recently, it was reported that Kim had ordered one of his top military officials be shot by firing squad for changing the words of a socialist anthem when singing karaoke. He was said to be furious after learning the man had changed the lines 'thanks to our party' to 'thanks to your party' and 'Hate your enemies, love your country,' to 'Hate your wife, love your mistress'. The move was considered a sign of a rebellious spirit and the man was dragged out of his home and put to death by firing squad the next day. It was also revealed that other former military leaders had suffered death by firing squad after they were caught watching Western soap operas.","UN special rapporteur on human rights in North Korea Marzuki Darusman said there was enough evidence to hold Kim accountable .

"Motorists are paying the price of a booming economy as congestion grows and traffic speeds slow, new figures reveal. Motorway traffic levels have reached an all-time high as the rise of ‘White Van Man’ delivering goods and services continues apace, according to the official Government figures. A-roads are also becoming busier with average speeds on some roads reducing. The price of a booming economy: Motorway traffic levels have reached an all-time high as the rise of ‘White Van Man’ delivering goods and services continues apace, according to the official Government figures . With the UK’s earnings gross domestic product (GDP) also growing the Department for Transport said; ‘It is likely that such economic growth is contributing to the continued upward trend in traffic volumes.’ The RAC said the ‘good news’ for the economy could spell bad news for millions of motorists caught in gridlock caused by extra traffic and bottlenecks. The new figures show that vehicles travelled a record 16.3 billion miles on British motorways from July to September 2014. This was 2.3 per cent higher than over the same period last year 2013 and 1.3 per cent higher than in April to June 2014. The Department for Transport (DfT) figures showed that total motor vehicle traffic on British roads increased 2.2 per cent in summer 2014 compared with summer 2013. Light goods vehicle traffic - typically white vans - continued to rise at higher rate than any other vehicle type, increasing 6.9 per cent in summer 2014 compared with summer 2013. Car traffic was up 1.4 per cent this summer, while traffic increased on all classes of road with the biggest rise (3.5 per cent ) being on urban minor roads. The Transport Department said: ‘GDP increased over Quarter 3 2014 (July to September) as the four key industrial groupings within the economy (services, production, construction and agriculture) indicated increases in output. ‘It is likely that such economic growth is contributing to the continued upward trend in traffic volumes.’ Rise of the white van man: Light goods vehicle traffic - typically white vans - continued to rise at higher rate than any other vehicle type, increasing 6.9 per cent in summer 2014 compared with summer 2013 . RAC head of external affairs Pete Williams said: “This is clearly good news in for the economy as motorways are vital for business and increased use indicates more activity, which has already been suggested by the latest rise in GDP for the third quarter of 2014. ‘However it does also put extra strain on parts of the road network adjoining motorways that are not able to cope with the volume of traffic and therefore lead to bottlenecks. ‘Many of these ‘pinch points’ are already being addressed by the Highways Agency which is good news for road users who will hopefully benefit from more free-flowing traffic conditions in the future.’ Mr Williams added: ‘The increase in light good vehicles, or ‘white van man’, is a really encouraging sign that small businesses and tradesmen, the lifeblood of the UK economy, are thriving.’ RAC Foundation director Professor Stephen Glaister said: ‘Whoever predicted that the link between economic growth and traffic volume was broken will have to have a rethink. GDP is up and mileage is up, just as the DfT has always anticipated. ‘These figures beg questions about what rising mileage means for congestion, emissions and particularly road safety.’ The professor said: ‘Last week we learned there has been a marked rise in road casualties after years of reduction. We urgently need a strategy on how we are going to preserve and improve on our generally good safety record against a backdrop of a rising population and increasing traffic.’","Good news for the economy spells bad news for motorists, says RAC .

"A former RSPCA inspector who blew the whistle on how dogs were allegedly routinely being put to sleep by the animal charity has been found hanged. Dawn Aubrey-Ward, 43, said she was forced to put down healthy pets during two years working for the charity in an interview with the Mail on Sunday last December. But the RSPCA responded by going on the offensive and attacking her credibility after she made the allegations. Praised: Dawn Aubrey-Ward is given a certificate for rescuing a lamb while working for the animal welfare charity as an inspector . The mother-of-four was found hanged in her home in the village of Martock, Somerset, last week. The day before her death she wrote on Facebook: 'That's it, I give up. I am unemployed, broke, struggling and allegedly ""damaged"".' Ms Aubrey-Ward claimed large numbers of animals were destroyed by the charity after being classed as ‘unsuitable for rehoming’ but that the definition could be widely drawn to often include older animals, those needing veterinary care, dogs deemed ‘aggressive’ or larger dogs which were ‘hard to home’. The animal-welfare charity destroyed 53,000 animals in 2011 – 44 per cent of those it took in. The mother joined them as a trainee inspector in 2007. But she soon found herself at odds with what she described as its ‘antiquated military-style’ regime which placed ‘prosecution and persecution’ of owners ahead of protection of their pets. In the interview with the Mail on Sunday, she added: ‘The RSPCA’s image was that they care for animals, prevent cruelty and help and advise people with animals. I was horrified when I learned we were going to have to put down healthy animals because we didn’t have room for them. It didn’t fit with their public image.’ Animal lover: Ms Aubrey-Ward, 43, was found hanged at her home in Somerset last week . However, the charity responded by attempting to discredit her claims and said: 'Dawn Aubrey-Ward is a disgruntled former employee who was subject to a disciplinary investigation for alleged theft of animals. She left with matters still pending.’ She responded on Twitter by hitting out at the charity's allegations. In a Tweet on December 31 she wrote: 'oh my !!!! They really are stooping low !!!! My animals are happy healthy and as for concerns omg ! That is evil !' And in a follow-up message on January 1: 'Would the official rspca like to deny they offered me several thousand pounds to keep my mouth shut ?' The East Somerset Coroner's office confirmed today that the 43-year-old was found dead at her home on May 8. Coroner Tony Williams has opened an inquest into the death and it has been adjourned until a date to be arranged later. Allegations: Dawn Aubrey-Ward, 43, said she was forced to put down healthy pets during two years working for the charity . Ms Aubrey-Ward's friend Jonathan Rich, a barrister, told The Times: 'She always tried to look on the bright side, but on some occasions when we spoke she was clearly at her wits-end. 'The response of the charity to the Mail on Sunday's piece about Dawn was disgraceful. Dawn's revelations were focused on improving animal welfare, but the charity's highly personal response made it very hard for her to get another job, particularly in the realms of animal welfare.' In 2011, the mother discovered her boyfriend Robert Colclough, 44, a civilian police worker, dead as he faced redundancy. Divorcee Ms Aubrey-Ward was reprimanded for giving . help and advice instead of issuing cautions, including the case of an . ill, elderly man whose cat lay dying on his lap. She took the cat away and put it down and was then upbraided for not cautioning the cat’s devastated owner for neglect. Her . career with the RSPCA ended when her bosses accused her of ‘stealing’ a . rescued tortoise which she’d taken home ready to take to an animal . centre. A spokesman for the RSPCA said simply: 'Our thoughts are with the family' and refused to comment further.","Dawn Aubrey-Ward, 43, blew the whistle in a Mail on Sunday interview .

Speaking after the hearing at Preston County Court, a close friend of Miss Simpson, said: 'She was not allowed to wear feminine clothes or make-up and was expected to continue living as a man, regardless of the transition procedures she had been through.' In 2011, Miss Simpson, from Tarleton, Lancashire, was said to be suffering extreme stress and was given a doctor's note to take time away from work. But the court heard when she returned to the business premises and gave the note to her brother - an employee of the firm - he screwed it up and threw it back at her, saying: 'This is what I think of your sick note.' Mr Simpson, who is currently listed as 'seeking a new position' on his LinkedIn page, explained his action by saying: 'I was frustrated at fielding calls from customers.' Miss Simpson, who has a degree in electronic engineering, started working for Simtec in 1994 - four years after the company was founded. In 2012, Mr and Mrs Simpson banned their daughter from the property for six months after she had her ears pierced, Preston County Court was told. Miss Simpson, who is listed as one of the company's directors online, is now suing her family for £150,000 which she claims she lost out on after being unable to run the business when she was denied access to stock and equipment. Her brother Gavin is counter-suing her for £19,000 of business expenses he claims were not reimbursed. Preston Country Court heard how Mr and Mrs Simpson banned their daughter from the property for six months after she had her ears pierced . But Miss Simpson claims she did not authorise the payments and added that some items, such as Christmas decorations and a set top TU box, were for her brothers personal use. Miss Simpson's Father, Graham, is suing his daughter for £99,000 in lost wages and her mother Glenys is claiming £66,000 of loans made to Simtec Electronics she claims have not been repaid. Neither party would comment further when approached. Following a five-day hearing, Judge Philip Butler reserved judgement on the case and will make a ruling on December 22.","Gillian Simpson worked at family IT firm Simtec Electronics in Lancashire .

"Oh dear, poor Gemma Worrall. If you haven't heard of her, she's the 20-year-old Blackpool beauty salon receptionist who became an overnight Twitter sensation last week with her ludicrously misspelled and misinformed observation on the Ukrainian crisis. If you really did miss it - and sadly for Gemma not many did - it went thus: 'If barraco barner is our president why is he getting involved with Russia, scary.' She's had more than her comeuppance for the public display of ignorance, with 7,000 re-tweets of her observation, making news as far away as Australia, a flood of comments berating her for her stupidity and the by now familiar online threats of violence and worse. Not so daft: Jenni Murray believes beautician Gemma Worrall, right, could build a career on her gaffe . She was called a stupid cow, an oxygen thief, warned not to breed and told by one particularly nasty tweeter how he would like to kill her. Then came those wishing to win political points, citing Gemma - who has 17 GCSEs and two A-levels, no less - as a product of our parlous education system. How could the nation justify the deep flaws that allowed such ignorance? Finally, the sniggers and fury died down, and there was a collective sigh of relief it wasn't one of us who'd made such an appalling gaffe. But I have a feeling it will be Gemma - and all the other beautiful girls like her - who will have the last laugh. They may, as the Yorkshire saying goes, have been at the back of the queue when the brains were handed out, but they'll probably have a far brighter future than young women who model themselves on clever old bluestockings like me. Comical error: Gemma's ludicrously misspelled and misinformed observation on the Ukrainian crisis . Think about it. Gemma's had numerous interview requests and been wooed with promises of thousands of pounds for prime-time TV appearances. To her credit - so far at least - she has resisted the temptation to make a packet from her notorious gaffe. It may, though, only be a matter of time before she succumbs to the pressure to become a public figure, given the tendency to handsomely reward the less educationally advantaged. With those 14 ditzy words, Gemma achieved what millions of well-informed girls - who could find Ukraine on a map in an instant - have failed to do. And that's to be recognised and rewarded. Times have changed and the value system seems to have gone into reverse. I call it 'being TOWIE-fied' after the millions made by the insufferably vacuous and wholly entertaining 'stars' of reality show The Only Way Is Essex. The ones who hit the headlines and make the money are those who work hard - at being in the gym or at the tanning salon. It's not brains that line your pockets or attract admiration now. Look at today's young barristers, who are striking for a day because they earn barely enough to keep them in shoe leather. Compare their earnings to those of glamour model Katie Price, TOWIE's Joey Essex and ditsy X Factor finalist Stacey Solomon. Reality TV stars: Members of the TOWIE cast have made millions from appearing to be stupid . Look at the brilliant young graduates pouring out of top universities each year who wind up working in burger bars. When I read about Gemma, it got me thinking about two young women I met at Crufts on Saturday. I had my two chihuahuas with me and had been asked to present the Toy Class trophy. They accosted me at the entrance to the Birmingham Exhibition Centre and begged me to buy a bracelet for chihuahua rescue. They were smart, charming and kind and I popped the bracelet on as I walked away. It was only later I noticed it read 'I love Chihuahua's'. Total apostrophe failure. I spent the rest of the afternoon dreading bumping into Lynne Truss, who was there too. She's the grammar and punctuation guru who wrote the bestseller, Eats, Shoots & Leaves. I'd have been so ashamed to be seen wearing such a mislaid apostrophe. When women like Lynne and I were young working-class girls, education was rigorous - and it mattered. Good exam results and a degree were our way of avoiding the kinds of lives which had so restricted our mothers - jobs as cleaners, factory workers or, at best, typists, followed by marriage, children and dependence on a husband. Last laugh? Gemma has been in demand to make media appearances . We dressed smartly, made sure our make-up was tasteful and that it would be our brains that would attract employers, who would respect our well-stocked minds and pay us accordingly. It was what society then required of us. We were expected to set aside the trivial, whether it be make-up, fashion, manicures or costly hairdos, and work hard to make our way professionally. For Lynne and me it worked. Would we manage to claw our way to the top of the CV pile now, with our perfect grammar, well-honed arguments on foreign politics and ingrained knowledge of the periodic table? I fear we might not. Women of our generation have encouraged our own children to take a similar path, only to find them burdened by student debt, struggling to find a decent job, paid peanuts if they do and with no prospect of ever saving enough money for a deposit on a house. So, is it us who have actually been the more stupid? I'm not saying that Gemma's obsession with hair extensions and make-up should replace education and hard work for other young women. But I do think more might benefit from taking up a similar career, rather than struggling along the academic route only to find no job at the end of it. For too long we've been deluded by the idea that everyone should have a degree to the detriment of our service industries. Perhaps now we'll learn to value those not suited to an academic training, but who are hugely important when the electricity goes off or the central heating fails or, in Gemma's case, when we need a makeover. These are, after all, the people we all seem to prefer watching on television; not boring old academics. Even those who don't get famous seem capable of making a far better living than better-educated counterparts - sad though that might be to say. When the sun shone last weekend, I abandoned my boots, got out the sandals and noticed what a terrible state my feet were in. I doubt I was the only 'clever girl' making an appointment for a 40-quid pedicure and 50-quid leg wax. Who's the stupid one now? And, anyway, is Gemma really as daft as some would have us believe? She may not know how to spell Barack Obama, she probably hasn't a clue where Ukraine is and thinks the Cold War is something to do with the Winter Olympics. Nevertheless, she knew that for a Western political leader to be getting involved in a dispute with Russia is scary. And that observation is not stupid at all. Maybe next time she will just be wise enough to keep her opinions to the confines of the beauty salon.","Gemma Worrall, 20, became an overnight sensation last week .

"Four new victims have come forward to make shocking claims about a vampire-obsessed trucker they say held them captive and kept them as sex slaves over an extended period of time. Timothy Jay Vafeades of Salt Lake City, Utah, has already been charged with kidnapping and abusing two women, one a relative, after he allegedly forced them to travel around the country in his truck while repeatedly having sex with him against their will. Vafeades, who wears fangs, named his truck the 'Twilight Express,' most likely in reference to the popular vampire series. Creep: Four new victims have come forward to say they were held as sex slaves by Timothy Jay Vafeades, a vampire-obsessed trucker who enjoys wearing fangs . New charges: Three of the new victims claim Vafeades used a Dremel power tool to grind down their teeth and one alleges he used an X-acto knife to give her new teeth . Now, four more woman have been identified as victims of the same alleged assaults. These new victims are making allegations very much similar to the two previous women, saying Vafeades, 54, took their cell phones and identification cards, forced them to shower and sleep naked with him, and beat them repeatedly while sexually assaulting them on a daily basis. Three of the victims also claim he used a Dremel power tool to grind off their teeth, and one alleges he took an X-acto knife to remove her teeth so she could wear false teeth. He also cut and dyed their hair and forced one woman to marry him. These new claims, which span from 1994 to as recently as 2013, come as federal prosecutors try and build up a case to use as evidence showing a pattern of behavior as they try Vafeades on charges related to his two most recent victims. According to the Salt Lake Tribune, Vasfeades' attorney is trying to have almost all of this evidence thrown out as he claims his client was unlawfully detained when officers first picked him up during a traffic stop in Minnesota. Behind bars: Vafeades is already being held without bail of kidnapping and assault charges related to two other victims, one a teenage relative . Caught: He was arrested at a truck stop in Minnesota (above) in November of 2013 when officers noticed his passenger, the teenage relative, was bruised and battered . It was during that stop that officers discovered his first victim, a 19-year-old relative of the man, that they claim was bruised and battered. Shortly after he was arrested, a second woman came forward with similar claims. Vafeades is also being charged with possession of child pornography after authorities found hundreds of child porn videos and images on his computer.","Four new victims have come forward and alleged they were held captive and forced to have sex with trucker Timothy Jay Vafeades .

"Schools cannot be a ‘hazard-free zone’ for children, a senior judge said yesterday as she stripped a nine-year-old pupil of £3,000 in compensation. Appeal Court judge Lady Justice Sharp said schools should be reasonably safe for pupils – who ‘are inclined to lark around’ – but could not safeguard them against freak accidents. She was ruling in the case of a schoolboy who successfully sued his local council for £3,215 in compensation after cutting his hand in a playground scuffle. Nine-year-old Lewis Pierce sued West Sussex County Council for damages after an accident at St Andrew's School in Nuthurst. The Court of Appeal overturned the decision . The Court of Appeal overturned the decision, saying the pay-out would mean ‘the law parting company with common sense’. Nine-year-old Lewis Pierce sued West Sussex County Council for damages after an accident at St Andrew’s School in Nuthurst. It arose when Lewis was sprayed with water from the fountain, which had been fitted in the playground earlier that day, by his seven-year-old brother, George. Incensed, he lashed out but George ducked and Lewis hit the fountain instead. He cut his thumb and damaged a tendon, which had to be repaired by surgeons under general anaesthetic. He made a full recovery from the accident in June 2010. The court heard that Lewis was ‘completely unconcerned’ by the 1in scar it left him with but his mother Annette began legal action on his behalf against the local education authority. The schoolboy hit a fountain Lewis hit the fountain during a scuffle. He cut his thumb and damaged a tendon, which had to be repaired by surgeons under general anaesthetic. File picture . Lawyers for the family said the school had not carried out a proper risk assessment before installing the water fountain and claimed that Lewis’s injury was the result of negligence or breach of duty. Brighton County Court agreed and awarded the schoolboy £3,215 in compensation last year.But West Sussex took the case to the Court of Appeal and argued that the same model of water fountain had been fitted in schools throughout England and Wales without causing injury. Iain O’Donnell, for the council, said schools might have to ban the fountains if Lewis was allowed to keep his pay-out, for fear of other potential claims. He told the court that schools could never be completely free from hazards. ‘Any part of the premises, for example the corner of a brick wall, could be perceived as sufficiently sharp to cause a laceration if punched,’ he said. The water fountain was ‘not unduly sharp to normal touch’ and Lewis’s injury was caused by his own ‘spontaneous and unpredictable act’, the Appeal Court heard. Lady Justice Sharp said schools should take reasonable steps to ensure children’s safety, ‘bearing in mind that children are inclined to lark around’. But she said they were not under a duty ‘to safeguard children in all circumstances’, adding: ‘The law would part company with common sense if that were the case.’ The Appeal Court ruled that the county council was not responsible for Lewis’s injury and warned that a ruling in his favour would have led to a legal obligation on schools to pad and protect every edge or corner on which a child could conceivably injure themselves. West Sussex County Council hailed the Court of Appeal decision as ‘a victory for common sense’. The legal costs of the original claim and the appeal will now have to be paid by the Pierces. The amount was not revealed. Mrs Pierce, 36, defended the decision to sue. Speaking at her family’s £300,000 home in Cowfold, West Sussex, she maintained that it was ‘more than a simple case of a minor accident resulting from a spot of playground rough and tumble’.","Nine-year-old Lewis Pierce sued council after accident, which left a scar .

"Fear of a trip to the doctors and a jab of a needle could be a thing of the past, with scientists developing a world-first needless injection to dispense vaccines. The study has developed a method in which people can inhale a vaccine through a nebuliser device to be safeguarded against potential infections. Researchers from Murdoch Childrens Research Institute and Monash University have successfully turned a liquid vaccination into an aerosol form against the flu through sound waves. World-first platform for inhaled vaccines could see the end of needles . When electricity is applied to the matchbox-sized device, it interacts with the medication to agitate a small and powerful wave, which forms a fine mist of particles. The timing of the measures spins so fast that the DNA molecules in solutions have no time to stretch or cause damage to their structure. Lead researcher Dr Anushi Rajapaksa told Daily Mail Australia that the new development hopes to influence more people to get their vaccinations in the future. Melbourne scientists have successfully trialled an aerosol form against flu . Dr Anushi Rajapaksa said the development holds a lot of promise for a replacement to vaccine injections . ‘One of the biggest problems with vaccinations is people tend to avoid getting needles because they don’t want to go through with it,’ she said. ‘We’re hoping that the inhale method will give people an alternative option and it’ll be a complimentary treatment as it’s a non-invasive method as oppose to needles. The nebulizer works as droplets containing the vaccine, which are inhaled and deposited on the surfaces of the lungs. After the DNA of the vaccine is introduced into a person's cells, those cells produce ‘antigen’ proteins. The immune system is trained to attack the disease by producing antibodies against these antigen proteins. ‘People can prescribe the medication and purchase it over the counter, which means they can do the inhaling vaccination in their own time at home and avoid  queuing up at the doctors,' Dr Rajapaksa told Daily Mail Australia. The nebulizer works as droplets containing the vaccine, which are inhaled and deposited on surfaces of  lungs . Dr Rajapaksa said the development holds a lot of promise for a replacement to vaccine injections which are associated with safety concerns in developing countries, requiring expensive and specialised handling, refrigeration, and staff training that many places in the world cannot afford. ‘Current vaccines often induce inflammation, causing pain, requiring monitoring by health care workers and resulting in peoples' unwillingness to seek vaccination. ‘We sought to re-engineer vaccine administration with our respiratory nebuliser for plasmid DNA vaccine delivery. A DNA-based vaccine can be produced in as little as two weeks, a critically important improvement in the face of a pandemic. ‘There is huge potential of this work to be used for mass vaccination programs especially in the developing countries with limited resources.’ Researchers have developed a potential alternative for vaccinations and successfully trialling a method in which people can inhale vaccine to be safeguarded against potential infections . The nebulizer technology can be made portable and only requires batteries for operation but will take five to 10 minutes to vaccinate as oppose to a one minute needle jab at the doctors. ‘If the technology picks up and can be mass produced with enough funding, it can be very affordable and could cost just under five dollars. ‘They’re designed to be reused and keep the delivery of vaccine safe for people,' she said. ‘But in terms of prototypes, we are still five to 10 years away from the market but once the development is completed, this is the future to inhaling any amount of influenza in one shot.’ The device is especially suitable for lung-related afflictions such as influenza, and, potentially for treatment of systemic diseases such as Malaria with entirely new DNA vaccines. The research was done in collaboration with Professor James Friend, Professor Leslie Yeo, Professor Els Meeusen, Dr. Michelle McIntosh, Professor Ross Coppel Dr. Aisha Qi, Dr. Jenny Ho, Dr. Rob Bischof, Dr. Tri-Hung Nguyen, Dr. Michelle Tate and Associate Professor David Piedrafita.","World-first platform for inhaled vaccines could see the end of needles .

"Smells can influence our views - and a particularly pungent one can increase our conservatism and even change our views on same sex marriage, it has been claimed. In a new study, titled 'Disgust and the Politics of Sex,' researchers say that an odour really can change our mind - and even change our religious views. The team tested a range of view on people both with and without exposing them to noxious fumes. A terrible smell can increase our conservatism and even change our views on same sex marriage, it has been claimed. The researchers tested their theory with the use of a noxious smell. Of the 57 participants, consisting of community members and students recruited via an online ad and paid $10 for their time, 30 were randomly chosen for the control group and the remaining 27 were in the variable group. The variable group was exposed to a stench caused by butyric acid, the smell found in rancid butter and sweat, that was placed on hidden cotton pads in the room. 'Disgust has been implicated as a potential causal agent underlying socio-political attitudes and behaviors,' the University of Arkansas team wrote in the journal PLOS One. 'The present study tested the effects of disgust on a range of policy preferences to clarify whether disgust is generally implicated in political conservatism across public policy attitudes or is uniquely related to specific content domains.' The team say their unusual research proved the theory. 'The study showed that exposure to a disgusting odor increased endorsement of socially conservative attitudes related to sexuality,' they wrote. 'In particular, there was a strong and consistent link between induced disgust and less support for gay marriage.' The researchers tested their theory with the use of a particularly offensive smell. Of the 57 participants, consisting of community members and students recruited via an online ad and paid $10 for their time, 30 were randomly chosen for the control group and the remaining 27 were in the variable group. The variable group was exposed to a stench caused by butyric acid, the smell found in rancid butter and sweat, that was placed on hidden cotton pads in the room. Participants were asked 'If a close friend of family member were gay, I would support their right to having a same-sex marriage?' - both with and without a noxious smell present. They say the results were shocking. 'In the research presented here, exposure to a disgusting odor caused greater endorsement of conservative views, including: rejecting gay marriage, restricting sex to marriage, disapproving of the use of pornography, and increased beliefs in Biblical truth. 'Rejection of gay marriage was a particularly strong response to the disgust-inducing odor, perhaps because of the connection between homosexuality and perceptions of sexual impurity. 'It is possible that some forms of political conservatism, particularly those related to sex and sexuality, are basic and inherent in some populations and can readily emerge under threatening or taxing conditions.'","Team found 'strong and consistent link between induced disgust and less support for gay marriage'

"The French are often accused of being grumpy and dismissive. But Britons and Americans are also hardwired to be miserable, scientists claim. Despite stable governments and good economies, those living in the UK and US will never be as happy as people in other nations, because they are simply born more miserable. They are genetically programmed to be less cheerful than the Danes, for example, who top the list of the happiest nation. Americans and Britons (such as the famously grumpy American actor Larry David, left, and British tennis star Andy Murray, right) are actually hardwired to be miserable, new research claims . Scientists found that French people (such as actress Eva Green) have one of the shortest forms of the gene, which may explain their reputation for being miserable . And scientists at the University of Warwick discovered it all comes down to a gene which regulates levels of the hormone serotonin in the brain. Short forms of the gene inhibit levels of the hormone, which can invoke depression. Meanwhile those with longer forms of the gene are more likely to be happier, as a result of higher levels of serotonin in the body. Researchers discovered people from Denmark have the longest form of the gene, and as such topped the happiness chart. But Professor Andrew Oswald said it could be worse, we could be French - the nation with one of the shortest forms of the gene, which may explain their reputation for being grumpy. The researchers, from the the University of Warwick, discovered it all comes down to a gene which regulates levels of the hormone serotonin in the brain. Short forms of the gene inhibit levels of the hormone, which can invoke depression. Meanwhile those with longer forms of the gene are more likely to be happier, as a result of higher levels of serotonin in the body. Researchers discovered people from Denmark have the longest form of the gene, and as such, topped the happiness chart. Annual tables of national happiness ratings, compiled by organisations across the world, tend to rank Denmark at the top, along with nations including Panama and Vietnam. They use factors ranging from job satisfaction to economic progress, health, wealth and education standards, along with weather, war and political stability to judge nations. Scandinavians do well as their health is good, they are educated to a high standard and they earn more. But warm weather countries can do well too. Some wealthy Western countries fare less well because there are big divides between rich and poor or they have high unemployment rates or less job satisfaction for instance. But according to Professor Oswald, many of these may still be miserable even if they are earning a fortune, basking in sunshine and living to 100. His findings from 131 countries for the ESRC Festival of Social Sciences, found genetics to be the most important factor but not the only one. The study found people living in Denmark had the longest form of the gene, and as a result were found to be among the happiest nations in the world . Grumpy: American-born Kristen Stewart is usually seen scowling when she is photographed, and once admitted she is a 'miserable' person in real life . Those who are either young or old tend to be happiest rather than those who are middle aged. Those who are slim are happiest, with obesity levels in some developed countries making them less happy as nations. And being married, in a job and well educated can also be a contributory factor. Professor Oswald, said: 'Intriguingly, among the nations we studied, Denmark and the Netherlands appeared to have the lowest percentage of people with the short version of the serotonin gene.' He added that many individual Americans were happy but they tended to be descended from immigrants who came from countries like Denmark in the first place. He said: 'There was a direct correlation between the (US) individual's reported happiness, and the levels of happiness in the country their ancestors had come from. 'Our study revealed an unexplained correlation between the happiness today of some nations and the observed happiness of Americans whose ancestors came from these nations.'","Scientists at Warwick University discovered the gene responsible for serotonin levels in the brain is responsible for setting your mood .

"Mouse lemur mothers-to-be (pictured) trick multiple males into thinking they are the father of their young, to stop their babies being killed off . Promiscuous mothers-to-be encourage ‘sperm wars’ by tricking multiple partners into thinking they are the father of their young, to stop infants being killed off, scientists claim. It is already known that that infanticide by male mammals - from mice to gorillas - is common in species where the females live in social groups dominated by one or a few powerful males. But now experts have uncovered the clever strategy used by females of certain species, such as the mouse lemur, to protect their offspring - and over time, their plan leads to infanticide dying out. University of Cambridge researchers compared detailed field observations for 260 mammalian species. They explained that when a rival male takes over groups of animals, they will kill infants to make sure they can produce their own offspring. To guard against this risk, females mate with as many males as possible in a short amount of time to confuse the paternity of their infants. The strategy means that any murderous male risks killing off his own offspring. Dr Dieter Lukas, from the university’s department of zoology, explained: 'The finding that females can actually, by mating with multiple males, stop them from killing her offspring, had not been proved before. 'It had been shown in individual species but it wasn’t clear that it was in response to infanticide.’ In species such as the mouse lemur, males must concentrate on producing larger quantities of sperm to ensure they can reproduce with lots of females. This causes the testis of male mouse lemurs to swell up to 10 times larger than normal in breeding season. Female bonobo monkeys can mate with every male in the troop of between 10 and 12 to protect their offspring (stock image) .Male bonobos have testes that are roughly 15 per cent larger than chimpanzees, who are very closely related and do commit infanticide . ‘In species in which infanticide occurs, testes size increases over generations, suggesting that females are more and more promiscuous to confuse paternity,’ Dr Lukas explained. ‘Once sperm competition has become so intense that no male can be certain of his own paternity, infanticide disappears, since males face the risk of killing their own offspring and might not get the benefit of siring the next offspring.’ ‘Female mouse lemurs only get sexually receptive on a single night during the whole year. ‘On that night she gets chased by all the males who are around, meaning six at a time can pile up trying to mate with her. ‘Several of them will actually mate with the female and the successful one will be the one who actually gives her the most sperm. Dr Lukas explained: ‘In species in which infanticide occurs, testis size increases over generations, suggesting that females are more and more promiscuous to confuse paternity. ‘Once sperm competition has become so intense that no male can be certain of his own paternity, infanticide disappears - since males face the risk of killing their own offspring, and might not get the benefit of siring the next offspring.’ Closely related species that differ in infanticide and testes size include chimpanzees, where the males commit infanticide, versus bonobos, where males have not been observed to kill offspring. Bonobos have testes that are roughly 15 per cent larger than those of chimpanzees. Similarly, male Canadian Townsend voles do not commit infanticide and have 50 per cent larger testes compared to infanticidal males of close relatives the North American meadow voles, Dr Lukas added.","University of Cambridge researchers have identified a strategy used by females from certain species to prevent infanticide .
Female creatures such as mouse lemurs mate with multiple partners .
They do this to trick males into thinking they're the father of their offspring .
Males want to carry on their genes in a group so they don't kill the babies .
Infanticide is common in groups where a few males live with many females .
Males have to create more sperm to fertilise multiple partners and over generations, their sex organs become larger ."

"James Packer's Crown has had to assure NSW authorities it won't deal with alleged underworld figure Stanley Ho in order to get approval for his Sydney Barangaroo casino. The revelation is contained in a VIP Gaming Management Agreement between Crown Resorts and the NSW casino regulator. The document had previously been blacked out but a motion from Greens MP John Kaye succeeded in having it made public on Thursday. James Packer's (right) Crown has had to assure NSW authorities it won't deal with alleged underworld figure Stanley Ho (left) in order to get approval for his Sydney Barangaroo casino . An artist's impression for the proposed Crown hotel and high roller casino at Barangaroo in Sydney . The agreement prevents Crown associating with Dr Ho who is accused of having organised crime links. Mr Packer is understood to be in business with the Macau casino mogul's son Lawrence through the business Melco Crown. 'To the extent to which it is within its power to do so, Crown will ensure that it prevents any new business activities or transactions of a material nature between Stanley Huang Sun Ho or a Stanley Ho Associate and Crown, any of Crown's officers, directors or employees or any Crown Subsidiary,' the agreement reads.

"Pressure continues to grow on Jean-Claude Juncker to quit as the new president of the European Commission after it emerged he has previously boasted of striking tax deals with large corporations. A review of his speeches while prime minister of Luxembourg revealed reportedly announced to parliament that AOL and Amazon were planning to move their European headquarters to the country thanks to favourable corporate tax conditions his government had created. It was reported last week that Luxembourg had granted secret deals to 340 companies allowing them to avoid paying billions of pounds in tax. Yesterday Mr Juncker launched a bizarre defence of the Luxembourg tax-dodging scandal, insisting he was not to blame despite having been its prime minister for 18 years - 15 of which were also spent acting as the country's finance minister. Not listening: Jean-Claude Juncker yesterday insisted he was not to blame for Luxembourg's tax scandal despite having been prime minister for 18 years - 15 of which were also spent as finance minister . Details of Mr Juncker's alleged tax deal boasts were revealed by the Wall Street Journal, who reviewed speeches he had made during his 18 year stint as prime minister of Luxembourg. During one speech in May 2003, Mr Juncker reportedly told parliament that both AOL and Amazon had agreed to move the European wings of their businesses to the grand duchy thanks to his work selling the country internationally as having an extremely favourable tax system. 'That AOL and Amazon come to Luxembourg, that with and through them we get a new perspective to the future, is the result of a correct tax policy, of a correct infrastructure policy, but also the result of tough negotiations with the top management of the groups,' he was quoted as saying. 'They took place in America, they took place here at home, and I did not lead them alone,' he reportedly went on to say. The revelations come as the European Commission - which Mr Juncker has only been president of since November 1 - continues to investigate tax agreements Luxembourg made with Amazon and a subsidiary of Fiat. In investigation centres on the accusation that Luxembourg may have helped both of these companies - as well as others - cut their taxes by shifting their profits to Luxembourg. President: A review of Jean-Claude Juncker's speeches while prime minister of Luxembourg revealed he had announced to parliament that AOL and Amazon were planning to move their European headquarters to the country thanks to favourable corporate tax conditions his government had created . Despite being Luxembourg's prime minister for 18 years - 15 of which were also spent as finance minister - Mr Juncker yesterday denied being involved in shaping the tax rulings that critics say enable corporations to slash their tax bills by shifting their European operations to the country. ‘There is nothing in my past indicating that my ambition was to organise tax evasion in Europe,’ he said during a press conference, adding that he was ‘not the architect of what you could call the Luxembourgish problem’. Instead he said it was up to the current Luxembourg government to explain the situation.. Bizarrely, he also appeared to blame the problems in Luxembourg on Britain and other countries in Europe blocking tax harmonisation across the continent. He suggested that tax rates that ‘can sometimes lack fairness’, a problem caused by countries such as the UK not wanting to give up sovereignty over taxation. ‘If there is insufficient tax harmonisation in Europe then this can be the result,’ he said. Some of the world's largest firms including top British companies like Dyson are using a Luxembourg tax avoidance scheme to get out of paying billions of pounds . At the press conference yesterday, Mr Juncker admitted that as prime minister he was ‘politically responsible’ for what happened in each and every corner of the country’, but indicated he did not know the tax deals were being negotiated. Companies such as Burberry and Dyson had their divisions in Luxembourg lend money to their operations in other countries. The interest payments made on these loans reduced the profits in these countries. In some cases it was claimed companies enjoyed tax rates of less than 1 per cent on profits moved into the country. Reports about the tax breaks surfaced last week, putting Juncker immediately under immediate pressure given the European Union's headline commitment to fighting tax fraud. Since the scandal broke, a number of European political figures have called on Mr Juncker to resign his European Commission presidency, including Tory MP Stewart Jackson .","Luxembourg accused of striking tax  deals with more than 300 corporations .

"A school governors' chairman says he was forced to quit his post after joining Ukip because they political party's policies are 'against it's ethos.' Mike Ward claims he was asked to step down from his role as Head of Governors at Eskdale School in Whitby, North Yorkshire after he became a member of Ukip. The Scarborough councillor, 70, who had previously stood as an independent, said he was invited to a meeting with headteacher Sue Whelan after his political switch was reported in local media. Resigned: Mike Ward (left) claims he was asked to step down from his role as Head of Governors at Eskdale School in Whitby, North Yorkshire, by headteacher Sue Whelan (right) after he became a member of Ukip . 'I had been a governor at Eskdale School for eight years and chair for five years when, as a Scarborough Councillor, I recently joined Ukip,' said the retired teacher. 'After this was reported in the local paper I was called in to school to see the head. She then asked me to resign saying Ukip’s policies were against the ethos of the school. 'I was astonished as politics had never played a part in my time as a governor but after some soul searching over the weekend and not wishing to cause the school any further issues I tendered my resignation which she accepted. 'Dedicated': Mr Ward has been a governor at Eskdale School for eight years, and chairman of the board for the past five years. He says politics had 'never played a part' in his time at the school . Desire for change: Mr Ward said the school's pupils 'must come first', and says he is 'neither extremist or racist', but is 'strongly advocating change' 'The pupils must come first. 'I am neither extremist or racist. I have always been independent, strongly advocating change. 'Ukip is fully committed to putting residents, their wishes and needs, first. 'More common sense must be applied to local decision making. It is the party for change, neither left or right but rather right from wrong.' Party leader Nigel Farage said it was 'atrocious' that Mr Ward had been asked to resign. 'It’s atrocious that Cllr Mike Ward a long standing, conscientious and dedicated School Governor has been forced to resign as a Governor of Eskdale School, a school he deeply cares for, just because he is a member of Ukip,' said Mr Farage. Anger: Party leader Nigel Farage (pictured) said it was 'atrocious' that Mr Ward had been asked to resign . 'Mike is a decent and honourable man who has always had the interests of the School and the wider community at the forefront of his mind and it is absolutely disgraceful that he has been treated in this way. 'This is discrimination pure and simple and I find it astounding that the head teacher has taken it upon herself to oust him. Questions need to be asked about why this has happened. 'In the meantime I stand with Mike and I can only hope the School sees sense and reinstates him.' Mr Ward stepped down from the governing panel claiming his decision made him 'persona non grata' at the school, which Ofsted inspectors ruled earlier this year requires improvement, having previously branded it 'outstanding'. Inquiry: Ukip deputy leader Paul Nuttall has called for a full independent inquiry into Mr Ward's resignation, and says he should be reinstated . Mr Ward has been a school governor at Eskdale for eight years and chairman for the last five. His teaching career included a two year stint in Filey. A complaint by a member of the public about his resignation has led to an internal investigation by the school into his resignation. But Ukip has now called for a full independent inquiry - and for Mr Ward to be reinstated, despite his resignation. 'This is an outrage, Mike has been a dedicated governor for years and it is totally unacceptable that membership of UKIP should be considered to be incompatible with being a governor,' said the party's deputy leader Paul Nuttall. 'This is discrimination against a conscientious man who has worked tirelessly for the school and it is a disgrace that the head teacher has taken it upon herself to oust him. He purely has the interests of the school and local youngsters at heart. 'There must be a full independent inquiry into this debacle and Mike should be re-instated. He is a former teacher and university lecturer and I'm sure his fellow governors had no problems with his completely unrelated political membership. 'Everyone is entitled to their own political views and I'm sure the other governors have theirs and possibly even belong to a political party but like Mike just concentrate on seeking the best for Eskdale School.' Despite initially vowing to carry out a full investigation, North Yorkshire County Council has now distanced itself from any inquiry. A council spokesperson said: 'North Yorkshire County Council has received a complaint from a member of the public about the resignation of the chair of governors at Eskdale School in Whitby. 'This is a matter for consideration not by the County Council but by the school's governing body. 'We understand that the governing body is taking this complaint seriously and will respond to the complainant.' A school spokesman told MailOnline today that Mrs Whelan would not be commenting on Mr Ward's claims.","Mike Ward claims he was asked to stand down after he joined Ukip .

"New research has found the prevalence of carrier bags is having a 'significant' impact on towns and cities . The number of plastic bags blighting the streets of Britain after being thrown away by shoppers is at its highest level in a decade, a report has revealed. A surge in the use of carrier bags, some of which can take hundreds of years to degrade, has seen supermarkets handing out more than one billion more than they did four years ago. And research has shown that the prevalence of carriers is now having a significant impact on the streets of our towns and cities, with more discarded bags than ever before. The number of areas with an unacceptable number of plastic bags lying on the ground has more than doubled in the last ten years. The finding was revealed in a yearly study into the amount of litter on Britain’ s streets by the Keep Britain Tidy campaign group. It will further reinforce the Government’s decision to levy a 5p charge on plastic carrier bags in England from next year. The Daily Mail has been running a ‘Banish the Bags’ campaign for six years with huge support from anti-litter campaigners, environmental groups and shoppers. As well as harming animals and birds, production and transportation of the bags is costly and harmful to the environment. Despite an overall decline in the amount of litter, the report shows the number of sites polluted with plastic bags is at its highest ever level. The analysis of 7,200 sites across England found that 11.4 per cent were littered by plastic bags between 2013 and 2014. In the previous year, 8.9 per cent of sites were shown to be blighted by carriers, while a significant increase has occurred from the 4.4 per cent recorded ten years ago. As well as being an eyesore, plastic bags have a significant environmental effect on our coastline, with around 70 bags littering every mile, and seas. They can be ingested by marine wildlife. The seven biggest supermarket chains handed out 8.3 billion bags - used by shoppers for an average of 20 minutes - in 2013. The analysis of 7,200 sites across England found that 11.4 per cent were littered by plastic bags between 2013 and 2014 . This was up from the 7.2 billion given to customers in 2009/10 and excludes the millions more bags handed out by smaller retailers. Carriers have been described by campaigners as ‘plastic poison’. Environment minister Dan Rogerson confirmed last night that the latest litter survey revealed a rise in dumped carrier bags. He said: ‘To counter this are preparations are well advanced for the introduction of a 5p charge on single-use plastic bags.’ ‘Litter has a huge impact on the quality of our streets and public spaces and we all have a responsibility to keep our communities tidy.’ ‘While we have made great progress in recent years, this research shows there is still more to be done. ‘I hope local authorities consider these results as they work to keep our neighbourhoods clean and tidy.’ The annual survey also found an increase in the number of fast-food and soft drinks-related litter on Britain’s streets. Cigarettes and other smoking material was once again the most littered item, followed by confectionary wrappers. A 5p charge per carrier bag will be introduced in England next October. Small shops employing fewer than 250 people are exempt. The plans are expected to raise £100 million for environmental causes a year. Charges introduced in Wales, which apply regardless of the retailer’s size, and Northern Ireland, have significantly reduced the number of carrier bags used per head of population. As well as harming animals and birds, production and transportation of the bags is costly and harmful to the environment . Retailers in Scotland began charging last month, while the Republic of Ireland has seen a staggering 90 per cent reduction in bag use after its introduction of a levy in 2002. Ministers hope the charge in England will reduce usage by between 75 and 80 per cent. After a promising reception, the announcement of a plastic bag charge by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg earlier this year has since been met with cross-party criticism. MPs have said that caveats attached to the charge will ‘dilute the benefits’. Earlier this year, the Government rejected calls by the Environmental Audit Committee to make bags sold by all retailers, not just major supermarkets and large retailers, subject to the charge. The committee said that the decision would lessen the effect of the charge in England compared to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, where all bags are covered by the 5p charge. Bodies representing small retailers, including the Association of Convenience Stores, the National Federation of Retail Newsagents and the British Retail Consortium, have all supported the charge. But Conservatives insist the exemption is needed to protect small business. Paper bags will also be excluded from the charge, unlike the rest of the UK, with campaigners claiming that such bags are one of the most littered items and often originate from fast-food establishments. Wales, which introduced the 5p per bag fee in 2011, has recorded a 79 per cent drop in plastic bag usage in the last four years. Northern Ireland also had a big fall of 71 per cent since introducing a 5p charge in 2013. Last year, Italy became the first European country to ban non-biodegradable single-use plastic bags.","Supermarkets handing out one billion more than they did four years ago .

"A teenager from West Africa who became sick while visiting Florida on holiday caused Jackson Memorial Hospital to go on high alert on Sunday amid fears that he may have the deadly Ebola virus. Officials said the patient took a taxi to Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach after he became sick with flu-like symptoms. Miami Beach Fire Rescue then transferred him to Jackson for further tests. A test performed by the Department of Health came back negative on Monday morning, but Miami Beach Mayor Philip Levine said the results were being sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for a final test. A hazardous materials team was called to Jackson Memorial Hospital, Florida, on Sunday amid fears that a teenager traveling from West Africa may have the deadly Ebola virus . 'Thank God it was negative,' Levine told WSVN. 'If there were to be anything above and beyond a general sickness, we need to be able to protect our residents and our tourists, and all the teams worked well together.' Authorities were taking no chances on Sunday and called in the hazardous materials team. Several police cars and rescue vehicles ringed Holtz Children’s Hospital at Jackson and the unit was quarantined for two hours following the teenager's transfer, reports the Miami Herald. ‘It’s important to point out that this patient did not meet the Centers for Disease Control case definition for Ebola, but the test is being conducted out of an abundance of caution, and health officials expect the test to rule out Ebola,’ said Florida Gov. Rick Scott on Sunday night. Miami Beach Mayor Philip Levine tweeted on Monday that the boy's test results have now been sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for a final test for Ebola . Officials said the patient took a taxi to Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach after he became sick with flu-like symptoms. Miami Beach Fire Rescue then transferred him to Jackson for further tests . It's almost a week since Liberian Thomas Duncan became the first person in the U.S. to be diagnosed with Ebola . 'Florida still does not have any confirmed cases of Ebola, and we hope we never do, but we are taking every preparedness step possible to keep our citizens and our visitors safe.’ A firm diagnosis can take 48 hours, experts say. Authorities haven’t disclosed the patient’s name or said which West African country he and his family were from. Jackson spokesman Edwin O’Dell had said the hospital was prepared to handle the case if it turned out to be Ebola. 'Jackson has been publicly forthcoming in asserting our confidence and readiness, and that we have established and tested protocols to deal with infectious diseases in general and with Ebola in specific,' he said. 'We will do everything to ensure safety and treatment for all of our patients.' It is almost a week since Thomas Duncan, who had traveled to Dallas from Liberia, became the first person in the United States to be diagnosed with the disease. The Florida Department of Health has requested 30 additional Ebola testing kits from the CDC to ensure that all of Florida’s public hospitals 'have the ability to test patients who county health officials and the CDC believe need to be tested for Ebola,' said Scott. The Health Department also requested '100 units of additional high-level personal protective equipment to ensure the state is ready to backfill any county whose medical personnel develop a future need for these supplies.'","A West African teenager became sick while visiting Miami Beach on Sunday and his family grew concerned that he may have Ebola .

"Graduates who scrape a third class degree are to be offered bursaries to train as teachers following a U-turn by the Education Secretary. Funding for teacher training was withdrawn from anyone with the lowest class of honours degree two years ago because Michael Gove wanted to improve the calibre of applicants. The move put England alongside high-performing countries such as South Korea and Finland which recruit top scholars. Scraping by: Graduates who get the lowest class of honours degree will be eligibile for government funding . But he has had to relax the ban in maths and physics because of a  collapse in the number of candidates. There were 709 teacher training vacancies in maths last year – around a third of the total spaces available. The shortfall in physics was 386. Under one of Mr Gove’s key reforms, thousands of graduates are now training in schools rather than going through a teacher training college. Critics claim that this approach is too fragmented and making it more difficult to analyse the numbers going into different subjects and predict the correct number of trainees needed for different areas. But supporters of the reform say that it allows schools a greater say in how teachers learn their craft - and removes them from the ‘damaging’ influence of Left-wing courses at colleges that favour trendy methods. Mr Gove wants more than half of teachers trained in schools by 2015. From next year, bursaries of £9,000 will be offered to graduates with a ‘relevant degree’ to entice them into teaching maths or physics. They must also have a B grade or higher at A-level in the subject they plan to teach. The decision will add to concerns about the quality of teaching in classrooms. U-turn: Michael Gove removed the bursaries for third-class students two years ago, but they are now to be reinstated . Experts have previously warned that pupils are falling behind in subjects including maths at primary school because many teachers only have a GCSE C grade in the subject. Earlier this month the Association of Teachers and Lecturers complained classroom support staff were increasingly being asked to stand in for teachers. Mr Gove has also faced criticism from Labour for allowing academies and free schools to use unqualified teachers – even though the party’s education spokesman Tristram Hunt and his predecessor, Stephen Twigg, have both taken classes in their constituencies. But there is increasing pressure for sufficient teachers in key subjects such as maths and physics since top universities indicated their preference for applicants with traditional A-levels. Official figures show a surge in the number of teenagers taking them at GCSE and A-level. An OECD report last week also revealed shockingly poor levels of numeracy in England compared with global rivals. Bursaries are also being increased in maths and physics for trainee teachers with higher degrees. Graduates with a 2:2 will be eligible for £15,000 instead of £12,000 and those with a 2:1 will receive £20,000, up from £15,000 - bringing them into line with applicants holding a first class degree. Schools minister David Laws said bursaries were rising in other subjects – although candidates will continue to need at least a 2:2 degree to qualify. Funding will not be available for low-priority subjects such as art and business studies. A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘Smaller bursaries will be available for graduates with a relevant degree and a good A-level in maths or physics who show real potential to be brilliant teachers.’","Bursaries to be offered in exchange for the worst possible honours degree .

"A tongue-in-cheek video welcoming the G20 international delegates to Brisbane makes fun of the Queensland host city's unused infrastructure, elderly demographic and slow WiFi services to name but a few. The hilarious parody, posted by Comedy group Collective Noun, opens with 'You might be looking out your hotel window wondering, ""Is this it?"" Yes.' And then goes on to have a dig at the large percentage of retirees who have chose Brisbane as their home to see out their twilight years. 'But before you judge our town, we'd like to let you know that we're actually the number one choice for retirement of women 66 to 67 years of age with family in the area. Impressed? I thought so.' Scroll down for video . 'But before you judge our town, we'd like to let you know that we're actually the number one choice for retirement of women 66 to 67 years of age with family in the area.

The $3.2billion tolled bypass tunnel that runs under the Brisbane river, was suggested as 'somewhere nice and quiet' to hold a business meeting. The adventurous types can always tackle Brisbane's iconic Storey Bridge: 'it's the second-best bridge climb in the country, of both available.' - the other being, of course, one of Australia's most famous landmarks - the Sydney Harbour Bridge.

"A Scottish island that has been trapped in time for decades is going on the market for £250,000 and could one day play host to eco tourists. The 64-acre island of Linga is listed for the same price as a two-bedroom flat in Edinburgh or Glasgow even though it has no power or water supply or a house which is move-in ready. Located in the Shetland Islands in northern Scotland, Linga’s eventual owner will be permitted to create an eco-tourism business, install wind-generated power, build a pier for boat access and restore two derelict croft houses as holiday homes. The 64-acre island of Linga is located in the Shetland Islands in northern Scotland . If the island sells and someone moves in it would be inhabited for the first time in over 80 years, although it is closer to Norway than it is to Scotland. The last known person to have lived on the island, part of the most northerly group of the British Isles, is reported to have been Captain James Fraser, who died in 1931. The stunning island lies in the Vaila Sound with just a few hundred yards of sea separating it from the mainland Shetland village of Walls. Sheltered from the Atlantic Ocean by the larger island of Vaila and surrounded by blue waters the island is small enough to walk across in less than half an hour. Linga’s new owner will have permission to rebuild the derelict croft houses alongside a new cottage . Untouched for a generation it includes pristine white beaches, a loch and an abundance of wildlife, according to a brochure from Shetland Estate, the listing agent. The brochure says: ‘Visitors would be able to take part in traditional crofting and fishing activities experiencing first-hand the annual cycle of activities required to support crofting during this period. ‘Considerable design and study work has been completed along with a fully developed business plan.’ Evidence of prehistoric settlements prove continuous occupation and human activity on the island for several thousand years. Linga lies in the Vaila Sound with just a few hundred yards of sea separating it from the village of Walls . Linga's current owner, Bob Thomson, hopes someone will finish off his ambitious project . In 1881 it is recorded to have been home to 13 people split between the two families but by 1901 only one of the houses was inhabited. Linga’s current owner, Bob Thomson, is selling the island with hopes that the new owner will revive it and finish off his ambitious project. It would give tourists the chance experience life as it was on a traditional Shetland croft at the end of the 19th century. Mr Thomson, who grew up in Shetland and bought the island in 2008, said: ‘I was brought up in Walls and as a child used to play on the island in the school holidays with friends as we grew up in small boats. ‘It needs a younger person to take over and complete the concept.’ Mr Thomson grew up in Shetland and bought the island in 2008 . Captain James Fraser, who died in 1931, is the last known person to have lived on the island . He added: ‘Owning an island is Shetland is the best feeling ever and it is very sad to have consider selling especially as the development concept has received such fantastic local support. ‘When talking to people abroad about owning the island they are always really impressed. My wife especially likes to tell people we meet overseas about Linga.’ Linga’s new owner will have permission to rebuild the derelict croft houses alongside a new cottage to provide self-catering accommodation with en-suite facilities and ground source heat pumps. And there are approvals for a windmill and solar panels to provide electricity to the island for the first time, in addition to new sewage systems and rainwater capture systems for water supply.","Island of Linga is located in the Shetland Islands in northern Scotland .

"Britain has leapfrogged Germany to become the most prosperous of all major European Union countries. As David Cameron battles with Angela Merkel over his plans to curb EU immigration, the Prime Minister has been boosted by news that the UK is one of the best places to work and do business. Legatum Institute's 2014 Prosperity Index reveals Norway as the most prosperous country in the world, while the Central African Republic finishes bottom of the rankings. Scroll down for video . The UK was singled out by the Legatum Institute as a good place to do business in its 2014 Prosperity Index . David Cameron is being forced to change his planned reform of immigration rules to win Angela Merkel's support . The UK is ranked 13, three places higher than last year's index, and one spot ahead of Germany. The two countries are locked in a battle over Mr Cameron's plan to renegotiate Britain's membership of the EU. The Prime Minister has vowed to put freedom of movement at the heart of his vow to claw back powers from Brussels. However, in an escalation of tensions between London and Berlin, Mrs Merkel has reportedly told Mr Cameron that Germany would rather see Britain leave the EU than allow him to tear up its rules on free movement of labour. The German Chancellor warned the Prime Minister that he is reaching a ‘point of no return’ by pushing for reform of the bloc’s sacred free movement system. The threat has forced Mr Cameron to tone down his ambitions for any deal to curb EU immigration. Legatum Institute's 2014 Prosperity Index reveals Norway as the most prosperous country in the world, while the Central African Republic finishes bottom of the rankings . Legatum Institute's 2014 Prosperity Index measures a set of eight categories that reveal how nations perform both economically and in vital areas of education, health, personal freedom, safety and security and entrepreneurship. France came 21st in the list, Spain 26th and Italy 37th, while Russia is the worst performing country in Europe, falling seven places to 68th. Chancellor George Osborne said the study provided further international support for the Government's long-term economic plan. He went on: 'Thanks to the difficult decisions we have taken to deliver economic security and control the public finances, we have moved three places up the global rankings. 'It's fantastic to see Britain leading the way for entrepreneurship, personal freedom, health and education.' James Barty, a special adviser to the Institute, added: 'Politicians are often blinkered by what drives national success. 'Although a solid economy is a pre-requisite - and the Government should be proud of its achievements in putting the public finances on a sound footing - other factors are vital when it comes to prosperity.' The index covers 142 countries in the world, accounting for 96 per cent of the world's population and 99 per cent of global GDP. The report found that the UK is one of the top countries in the world for entrepreneurship, ranked 8th worldwide. It singled out the fact that it is ‘relatively easy to start a business, costing only around £66’. There are also strong internet connections while the coalition government ‘have taken a number of steps to increase support for entrepreneurs and this seems to have helped public perceptions with the number of people who believe that hard work pays, growing by 6 per cent, to 84 per cent, since 2009’. It also found 74 per cent of Brits donate to charity, the 4th highest in the index, compared to 42 per cent in Germany and 26 per cent in France. France has dropped out of the top 20 for the first time, falling to 21st place.  Earlier this month Mr Cameron took a swipe at France's struggling economy, ridiculing its 'nonsense' rule stopping people working more than 35 hours a week. The Prime Minister said the French 'obsession' with the policy was to blame for the country's unemployment crisis – with more than 10 per cent of the population out of work, while the UK's jobless rate has plummeted to just 6.2 per cent. Mr Cameron's jibe, which will spark fury in Paris, comes after the International Monetary Fund predicted Britain would overtake France to become the second-biggest economy in Europe next year. Mr Cameron said France was in danger of falling for the 'nonsense' idea that there were a fixed number of jobs in the economy and that a 35-hour week would help share the work around. He acknowledged it was 'very dangerous' to point a finger at a fellow European country, but launched an attack on the policy which has remained in place under socialist president Francois Hollande - despite calls for reform from within his own administration.","Legatum Institute's 2014 Prosperity Index puts UK 13th and Germany 14th .

"Many of Britain's biggest stars of stage and screen admit they struggle to understand Shakespeare because of the way they were taught the Bard's plays at school. Sir Michael Gambon, the star of the Harry Potter films, admits he is 'frightened' by England's national poet, while Mark Rylance, the former artistic director of Shakespeare's Globe Theatre, says he sometimes shares that 'familiar feeling of giving up at a Shakespeare play'. The stars vent their frustration in a new BBC Four documentary, Muse Of Fire. Sir Michael, who has played Othello, Macbeth and Coriolanus, said: 'I am very frightened of it (Shakespeare), although I know there is nothing to be frightened of.' Zoe Wanamaker, who has starred in a string of Shakespeare productions at the National Theatre, said she found some of Shakespeare's words 'incomprehensible' Other stars admit they struggle to understand the concept of the iambic pentameter, which is supposed to unlock Shakespeare's language by helping actors understand the rhythm of the words. Zoe Wanamaker, who has starred in a string of Shakespeare productions at the National Theatre, said she found some of Shakespeare's words 'incomprehensible', adding: 'I don't know really what iambic pentameter is. Somebody has to tell me.' Christopher Eccleston, who played Iago in a BBC adaptation of Othello, said: 'I have never had a formal lesson in iambic pentameter. I don't understand it.' Eccleston added: 'My introduction to Shakespeare was in the fifth year of my secondary comprehensive school. You should not give kids Shakespeare straight away. 'You should give them drama and the ones who are really passionate about it will end up finding Shakespeare themselves because he is the greatest-ever playwright.' Even Ralph Fiennes, who directed a film adaptation of Coriolanus, admits he struggled with Shakespeare. He said: 'I got E for English at A-level. I didn't know how to answer a complex question about King Lear.' Muse Of Fire will be shown on BBC Four at 10pm on Thursday.","Zoe Wanamaker: 'I don't know really what iambic pentameter is'

"Plans to make teenage boys and girls share school toilets have been condemned by children’s campaigner Esther Rantzen. The ChildLine founder said the proposal for unisex toilets at a school  in Kent was ‘one of the worst ideas I’ve ever heard’. The move will mean that girls as young as 11 will share the bathroom facilities with 16-year-old boys. Anger: The plans were condemned by parents and the ChildLine founder Esther Rantzen, pictured . Parents at The Towers School in Ashford, which has 1,400 pupils, believe the plans will remove pupils’ privacy and provide an environment for bullying. And they fear the plans could lead to children having sex in the toilets. But the school governors have given their backing to the scheme and claim it will cut down on vandalism. Ms Rantzen said: 'These children are at an age when they are extremely self-conscious and aware of their bodies and the changes they experience' ‘These children are at an age when they are extremely self-conscious and aware of their bodies and the changes they experience,’ said Ms Rantzen. ‘It’s an extremely delicate time for them and one would hope that a school would seek to make them as comfortable as possible. This is one of the worst ideas I’ve ever heard and I suggest the school rethinks its proposal.’ Parent Daniel Gray, 39, said: ‘Many parents are upset that the school has dreamt up these proposals without consulting them. Some girls will be  as young as 11 and experiencing puberty – not something to be shared with teenage boys as old as 16. ‘I think it is a bit much to ask teenagers to be responsible enough to give each other privacy. Girls in particular need privacy and there will be boys calling at them over the cubicle doors. ‘Teenagers are full of hormones and I’m sure this will encourage them to canoodle in the loos – whether it’s heavy petting or worse.’ Designs for two shared toilet areas have been posted on a school noticeboard, one with 11 cubicles for females, ten for males and one for disabled pupils, the other with eight male  toilets and ten female. Both have wash basins in the middle of the room. A sign underneath the designs reads: ‘These are just to give an idea of the proposed layout for the new unisex toilets. The colours of the cubicles  and hand wash area we propose to have will be much brighter and the whole area more modern looking.’ School governor Simon Petts said the governing body has approved  the idea and is waiting for it to go to a funding committee. He added: ‘The toilets have been in desperate need of refurbishment for a long time and we decided the best way of reducing vandalism was to make them unisex. I understand parents’ concerns but we have had someone researching child welfare and this has  not raised any red flags.’","Plans for Towers School in Ashford, Kent, condemned by Esther Rantzen .

"The U.S. government now patrols nearly half the Mexican border with drones to control desolate stretches where there are no agents, camera towers, ground sensors or fences, and it plans to expand the strategy to the Canadian border. It represents a significant departure from a decades-old approach that emphasizes boots on the ground and fences. Since 2000, the number of Border Patrol agents on the 1,954-mile border more than doubled to surpass 18,000 and fencing multiplied nine times to 700 miles. Under the new approach, Predator Bs sweep remote mountains, canyons and rivers with a high-resolution video camera and return within three days for another video in the same spot, according to two officials with direct knowledge of the effort on condition of anonymity because details have not been made public. Scroll down for video . The U.S. government now patrols nearly half the Mexican border by drones alone in a largely unheralded shift to control desolate stretches where there are no agents, camera towers, ground sensors or fences . U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agents fly a drone from a trailer, which shows weather, maps and real-time images of the ground below . The aircraft, in use since 1995, can be equipped with missiles and has seen combat over Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bosnia, Serbia, Iraq, Yemen, Libya, Syria, and Somalia. The two videos are then overlaid for analysts who use sophisticated software to identify tiny changes - perhaps the tracks of a farmer or cows, perhaps those of immigrants who entered the country illegally or a drug-laden 4x4, they said. About 92 per cent of drone missions have shown no change in terrain, but the others raised enough questions to dispatch agents to determine if someone got away, sometimes by helicopter because the area is so remote. The agents look for any sign of human activity - footprints, broken twigs, trash. About four per cent of missions have been false alarms, like tracks of livestock or farmers, and about two per cent are inconclusive. The U.S. government plans to expand the strategy to the Canadian border. It represents a significant departure from a decades-old approach that emphasizes boots on the ground and fences . A U.S. Customs and Border Patrol drone aircraft is prepped near a hangar prior to it's flight . The drones patrol at altitudes between 19,000 at 28,000 feet and between 25 and 60 miles of the border . The remaining two per cent offer evidence of illegal crossings from Mexico, which typically results in ground sensors being planted for closer monitoring. The government has operated about 10,000 drone flights under the strategy, known internally as 'change detection,' since it began in March 2013. The flights currently cover about 900 miles, much of it in Texas, and are expected to expand to the Canadian border by the end of 2015. The purpose is to assign agents where illegal activity is highest, said R. Gil Kerlikowske, commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, the Border Patrol's parent agency, which operates nine unmanned aircraft across the country. 'You have finite resources,' he said in an interview. 'If you can look at some very rugged terrain (and) you can see there's not traffic, whether it's tire tracks or clothing being abandoned or anything else, you want to deploy your resources to where you have a greater risk, a greater threat.' If the video shows the terrain unchanged, Border Patrol Chief Michael Fisher calls it 'proving the negative' - showing there isn't anything illegal happening there and therefore no need for agents and fences. A U.S. Customs and Border Patrol drone flight trailer, where pilots operate drone aircraft . The government has operated about 10,000 drone flights under the strategy, known internally as 'change detection,' since it began in March 2013 . The strategy was launched without fanfare and expanded at a time when President Barack Obama prepares to issue an executive order by the end of this year to reduce deportations and enhance border security. Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee, applauded the approach while saying that surveillance gaps still remain. 'We can no longer focus only on static defenses such as fences and fixed (camera) towers,' he said. Sen. Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican who co-authored legislation last year to add 20,000 Border Patrol agents and 350 miles of fencing to the southwest border, said, 'If there are better ways of ensuring the border is secure, I am certainly open to considering those options.' Border missions fly out of Sierra Vista, home of the U.S. Army Intelligence Center at Fort Huachuca, or Corpus Christi, Texas. They patrol at altitudes between 19,000 at 28,000 feet and between 25 and 60 miles of the border. The first step is for Border Patrol sector chiefs to identify areas that are least likely to attract smugglers, typically far from towns and roads. Analysts scour the drone videos at operations centers in Grand Forks, North Dakota; Riverside, California; and Sierra Vista. After an initial survey, the drones return within a week for another sweep. Privacy advocates have raised concerns about drones since Customs and Border Protection introduced them in 2006, saying there is potential to monitor innocent people under no suspicion. Lothar Eckardt, the agency's executive director of national air security operations, said law-abiding people shouldn't worry and that cameras are unable to capture details like license plate numbers and faces on the ground. Eckardt looked on one September morning as a drone taxied down a runway in Sierra Vista, lifted off with a muffled buzz, and disappeared over a rocky mountain range into a blue Arizona sky. About a dozen computer screens line the wall of their trailer, showing the weather, maps and real-time images of the ground below. Eckardt said there is 'no silver bullet' to border security but that using drones in highly remote areas is part of the overall effort. If there's nothing there, he said, 'Let's not waste the manpower here. Let's focus our efforts someplace else, where they're needed.'","Predator drones used to patrol remote stretches of 1,954-mile border .

"Australian Greens Senator, Dr Richard Di Natale, reportedly wants to be chauffeured around Africa during a planned West African field trip 'to monitor the international response to the Ebola crisis'. The Daily Telegraph has reported that the Senator wanted Foreign Minister Julie Bishop to order the Australian High Commission in Ghana to chauffeur him around Africa. But his bold fact-finding mission could already be over, with the Federal Government making it clear that they would not provide consular assistance because what he has proposed is considered 'too dangerous'.

'Prior to being elected I was a public health specialist with experience in outbreak investigations so I am keen to visit West Africa,' Dr Natale stated. Dr Di Natale insisted he would pay his own way. 'My trip to West Africa will be privately funded but a worthwhile field trip would be impossible without assistance from the Australian government,' he said. His request to the Federal Government included consular assistance in getting to and holding talks with health officials working in the region. 'Meetings with representatives from the World Health Organisation, the United Nations coordinating team and NGOs would simply not be possible without consular assistance,' the Senator added. 'I welcome the government’s change of heart on the deployment of Australian personnel to West Africa but concerns remain about the nature and scale of our involvement.'

The Senator did not hold back when he said 'delaying action until now has cost lives needlessly so I call on the government to provide me with the necessary embassy support for a field visit to help ensure we get this right'. He'd previously also questioned the Federal Government’s Chief Health Officer about what training has been provided to Australian health personnel who could be deployed to combat Ebola. 'Health workers who are currently in West Africa to fight the Ebola epidemic have received intensive training in Europe before deployment,' he said at the time.

"Tribute act: James Crockett performed on stage in Tenerife while claiming benefits in the UK . A Robbie Williams tribute act who admitted claiming £8,500 in incapacity benefit while performing the singer's greatest hits in Tenerife has walked free from court. James Crockett claimed he was too ill to work, but was able to travel to the Canary Islands to perform chart-topping hits by the former Take That singer and Michael Bublé. Crockett, whose stage name is Andy James, pleaded guilty to failing to tell the Department for Work and Pensions that he was no longer unable to work for most of 2012. The 43-year-old, whose website claims he is the 'only choice' when it comes to Robbie Williams impersonators, illegally claimed £8,463 over the course of the year. His separate Bublé tribute act webpage claims he 'delivers Bublés [sic] greatest hits with the same flamboyance and panache as the man himself'. Crockett was spared jail following a hearing at Bradford Crown Court - despite the judge previously acknowledging that the public was 'outraged' by benefits cheats. Judge Durham Hall told Crockett: 'All the while you were strutting your stuff on various stages in this country and abroad. 'Clearly your breach was particularly deliberate and wilful and the public are fed up and outraged when they pay their taxes, if they are lucky enough to have a job at all, and then see somebody living to some extent an interesting, if not high, life and pocketing £8,500.' The judge said he had intended to send Crockett to prison, but having considered the current sentencing guidelines a short jail term of about two months would be derisory. Crockett, of Skipton, West Yorkshire, who has no previous convictions, underwent surgery for a serious back problem in 2002 and was nearly paralysed. The court previously heard that he had suffered medical difficulties for a number of years, including a stroke, and was advised by his GP to move somewhere warm because of problems with his back. Crowd-pleaser: Crockett first started claiming incapacity benefit in 2012 after an operation on his back . Claims: Crockett, pictured performing as Robbie Williams, initially said he was ignorant of the benefit system . Prosecutor Emma Downing said that when he was initially questioned about his offending he denied being dishonest and said he was ignorant of the benefit system. But the court heard that Crockett had eventually pleaded guilty to the charge. He is now voluntarily repaying the £8,463 he fraudulently claimed at the rate of £40 per month. Judge Jonathan Durham Hall QC had warned Crocket at a hearing last month that he could be jailed for the offending, but today decided to impose a 12-month community order which includes 150 hours unpaid work and a three-month home curfew between 7pm and 7am. Crockett will also have to pay costs of £200. 'Interesting life': Crockett is now repaying the £8,463 he fraudulently claimed at the rate of £40 per month . Walked free: Crockett, who also performed as Michael Bublie was spared jail today following a hearing . Barrister Charlotte Worsley, for Crockett, stressed that his benefit claim had not been fraudulent from the outset and he had now learned his lesson. 'He is a man who has had some real health difficulties over the years,' said Miss Worsley. She submitted that the offending was nearly three years ago now and added: 'He is ashamed and embarrassed that he is before the courts today.'","James Crockett first claimed incapacity benefit in 2004 after back operation .

"The cremated remains of an Ohio woman that were supposed to be delivered to her husband didn't arrive as scheduled or in time for her funeral, and now the U.S. Postal Service is trying to figure out what happened to the package. Eighty-year-old Barbara Kirkendall died on November 5 at a Cleveland hospital, apparently because of a blood infection, and her remains were sent to her Columbus-area home after the autopsy and cremation, The Columbus Dispatch reported. Norman Kirkendall was supposed to receive his wife's ashes by noon Saturday under a money-back, Priority Mail Express 1-Day guarantee.

Her remains had been shipped to Columbus and signed out for local delivery, the newspaper reported. What happened after that is a mystery. A Postal Service spokesman, David Van Allen, said a 'vigilant search' is being conducted. The Kirkendall family attended a memorial service Thursday without the remains, but her husband said the planned military burial in Dayton is postponed until the ashes are found. True love: Norman Kirkendall is heartbroken after losing his wife and not holding on to her remains is making her death even more difficult to process . Movie star grace: Norman Kirkendall said he couldn't help but fall in love when he first saw Barbara and how he likened her beautiful brunette features to that of a classic movie star . Kirkendall told the Columbus Dispatch that he can't sleep and that his heart feels as though it is going to beat out of his chest. Kirkendall knew soon after meeting the brown-haired petite beauty he described as 'looking like a movie star,' that he was going to marry her. The couple shared their 61st wedding anniversary last month and had five children together, one of them was named after Barbara. Kirkendall said his wife told him that she wanted an autopsy after she died for scientific purposes to help other people. 'If she could save someone else’s life, she would want that,' he said. Kirkendall, heartbroken, is begging the post to find his wife's remains. 'Somebody,' he said, 'needs to do something.' 'I am just torn up inside,' Kirkendall told ABC.

"The dreaded polar vortex will rear its frigid head this year despite previous predictions to the contrary, an expert Michigan forecaster said Thursday, just as New York City officials warned Gothamites to brace for the first snow of the season. Michigan meteorologist Mark Torregrossa revealed his predictions on Mlive.com, where he writes 'the polar vortex is already dropping farther south than normal.' His report goes head to head with one out of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration just last month, which suggested this year's cold months simply won't be as historically bone-chilling as last winter. Scroll down for video . Chilled: Things weren't looking good for the Midwestern US on Thursday afternoon as high temps were below freezing in some unfortunate places--Minneapolis and Chicago among them . Polar vortex? A massive arctic bubble ahead of a polar vortex expected to settle near Hudson Bay by Tuesday was set to force temperatures down to around 10F below normal for this time of years just about everywhere except the West Coast, Southwest and Southern Florida . Sign of things to come: New York City, still shell-shocked from last year's record chills, already had snow on the way Friday. The folks at NYC Sanitation included a photo, presumably from last year, as an unsettling reminder . As of Thursday, with Midwest temps poised to dip to record lows for November and snow already threatening the Eastern Seaboard, it appeared Torregrossa's was the forecast to follow. Accuweather.com predicts an 80 percent chance of snow and ice would clog travel up I-95 from northern New Jersey into southern New England starting Thursday and stretching into Friday. NYC Sanitation issue a 'snow alert' for 8pm THursday. 'Salt spreaders are loaded and ready to be deployed,' they tweeted. 'Drive carefully.' New York can expect about a half-inch of the white stuff to pile up Thursday. Meanwhile, a massive arctic bubble ahead of a polar vortex was set to force temperatures down to around 10F below normal for this time of years just about everywhere except the West Coast, Southwest and Southern Florida. 'It looks like we are heading for a much colder than normal start to the winter,' Torregrossa writes. Pointing toward a 'long expected' El Nino this winter, NOAA forecaster Mike Halpert just last month wrote: . 'A repeat of last winter is not particularly likely.' We can hope NOAA has the more accurate predictions, but until then, expect a bracingly cold weekend in much of the U.S. The Arctic chill is gripping the Rockies and Upper Midwest - and it's crawling east. A new study says that as the world gets warmer, parts of North America, Europe and Asia could see more frequent and stronger visits of that cold air. Researchers say that's because of shrinking ice in the seas off Russia. Normally, the polar vortex is penned in the Arctic. But at times it escapes and wanders south, bringing with it a bit of Arctic super chill. That can happen for several reasons, and the new study suggests that one of them occurs when ice in northern seas shrinks, leaving more water uncovered. Normally, sea ice keeps heat energy from escaping the ocean and entering the atmosphere. When there's less ice, more energy gets into the atmosphere and weakens the jet stream, the high-altitude river of air that usually keeps Arctic air from wandering south, said study co-author Jin-Ho Yoon of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Wash. So the cold air escapes instead. That happened relatively infrequently in the 1990s, but since 2000 it has happened nearly every year, according to a study published Tuesday in the journal . A visual representation of the dreaded polar vortex. Is it coming and do we have melting sea ice to blame? Sharp drops in temperature are expected in other parts of the U.S. in the coming days, thanks to a powerful weather system that hit Alaska with hurricane-force winds over the weekend before blanketing several state ins snow. Dangerously cold weather was expected to linger until Thursday in eastern Montana, where temperatures could reach as low as negative 30 degrees. Denver's high was only was 5 degrees on Wednesday, a day after the snow-covered city broke a nearly century-old record for the lowest temperature ever recorded on a Nov. 11. The frigid air was expected to crawl into the Appalachians, mid-South and the East Coast by Thursday. Forecasters have issued freeze and cold-weather warnings across parts of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. In Billings, Montana, where temperatures fell from the high 60s into the single digits on Tuesday, Patsy Kimmel said she was warned about the weather before arriving from Oklahoma to celebrate her 70th birthday with family. 'Yesterday I was wearing sandals and a short-sleeve shirt, and today I'm wearing a coat and scarf and turtleneck and sweatshirt and gloves,' she said.

Temperatures fell more than 30 degrees overnight in northern Illinois, from a high of 58 on Tuesday to 26 degrees on Wednesday. Similar swings hit Oklahoma City, where temperatures went from 80 degrees Monday to a low of 30 on Tuesday. In the Dakotas, wind chills made it feel like 20 below in some places. But that was good news for Action Mechanical Inc. of Rapid City, South Dakota, a heating and ventilation business that was doing booming trade. 'Bang! We get this arctic blast, and it just opens the floodgates,' said John Hammond Jr., a department head. 'We're behind right now as we're sitting here talking.' Parts of Michigan's Upper Peninsula were buried in more than 3 feet of snow on Wednesday, with more snow forecast through the weekend, along with temperatures that dipped in the 20s and 30s. Up to 18 inches fell in northern Wisconsin, while parts of central Minnesota saw more than 16 inches of snow. Many roads were snow-covered and slippery Wednesday in the Upper Peninsula, where residents are accustomed to snowy conditions. Of his drive into work, National Weather Service meteorologist Justin Titus said that roads were 'just rutted out and kind of felt like you were driving over a washboard.'

"The privacy of patients’ medical records is being breached by snooping NHS staff an average of six times a day. Personal details have been posted on social media or even dumped by the side of the road. In one instance, a manager at a GP surgery went through the files of nearly 2,000 women for his own ‘interests’. The privacy of patients' medical records is being breached by snooping NHS staff an average of six times a day, figures show (file picture) Other staff have been caught looking at the medical records of their friends, family and, in one case, a love rival. Figures obtained by the campaign group Big Brother Watch show there were 7,255 ‘data breaches’ by NHS staff between 2011 and 2014, an average of 2,418 a year. These are when private information about a patient is seen by anyone other than themselves or their doctor or nurse. The figures obtained through Freedom of Information requests show staff discussed patients by name on Facebook or Twitter on 50 occasions. There were a further 103 instances when data had gone missing, including medical files being dumped by the side of the road or left on a train. Despite the seriousness of some of the breaches, only 61 staff were dismissed over the three years. There are no figures for the numbers who ended up in court. The figures highlight extraordinary lapses by staff ahead of the controversial Care. Data project to harvest confidential information from patients’ medical files. Personal details are being posted on Facebook, emailed to strangers and dumped by the side of the road . NHS officials are about to begin a pilot project across 265 GP surgeries which involves uploading information from patients medical file onto a computer database. Eventually it will be rolled out across the country and unless patients object in writing or in person, their data will be automatically harvested. NHS officials say the Care.Data scheme will unlock a wealth of information that will help expose poor care – such as long waiting times – and may even unlock new treatments. But campaigners say the data will be shared too easily with private companies such as insurance firms who could use it to hike up premiums. Emma Carr, director of Big Brother Watch, said: ‘The information held in medical records is of huge personal significance and for details to be wrongly disclosed, maliciously accessed or lost is completely unacceptable. ‘With an increasing number of people having access to patients’ information, the threat of data breaches will only get worse. ‘Urgent action is therefore needed to ensure that medical records are kept safe and the worst data breaches are taken seriously. ‘If the Government wants to introduce new schemes which will make the public’s data more accessible, then this must go hand in hand with greater penalties for those who abuse that access. ‘This should include the threat of jail time and a criminal record.’ Yesterday ministers announced they had appointed the first national data guardian tasked with ensuring patients’ privacy is not breached. Dame Fiona Caldicott will oversee how patients data is used and intervene if there is any cause for concern. She has previously written two reports about the benefits of using potentially valuable information whilst maintaining patients trust. The Government was forced to delay the Care.Data scheme in February following mounting concerns by doctors that patients had been left in the dark. It is now being cautiously re-introduced while officials try and make patients aware of what will happen with their records and how to opt out. And yesterday ministers promised to give patients better access to their own records enabling them to view test results and order repeat prescriptions on smart phones and laptops. Health secretary Jeremy Hunt pledged that by 2018, patients will see their entire medical history at the click of a computer button. Eventually ministers hope that patients will be able to download test results and scans without having to book appointments at surgeries or hospitals. Phil Booth, of the campaign group Med Confidential said: ‘The Care.Data debacle has shown the serious consequences when proper governance is ignored, or only bolted on once things have already collapsed. ‘Meaningful sanctions would show these toxic breaches are being taken seriously, but to rebuild trust requires that every patient knows where their information has gone, and why.'","Personal details are being posted on Facebook and emailed to strangers .

"Senator Jeff Flake's son and his young wife have pleaded not guilty to animal cruelty charges after 21 dogs died from heat exhaustion while in their care last summer. Austin Flake and his wife Logan, both 21, entered their pleas in Maricopa County Superior Court, Arizona on Thursday. 'Austin and Logan Flake have declared their innocence,' the Flakes' attorney Dennis Wilenchik said in a statement. 'This was a tragic and unforeseen accident, nothing more.' They were acting as caretakers at a dog-boarding facility owned by Logan's parents while the couple, Jesse Todd Hughes and Maleisa Maurine Hughes, were away in Florida. Denial: Austin Flake, 21, and his wife Logan Flake, 21, pictured in their mug shots, have pleaded not guilty to animal cruelty charges after more than 20 dogs died in their care over the summer . Accused: The couple were looking after the boarding facility while Logan's parents, the owners, were away . Family: Austin is pictured in 2008 with his father Senator Jeff Flake, mother Cheryl Flake, and sister Alexis . Sheriff's department investigators concluded that the canines likely died on June 20 from suffocation and heat exhaustion after being confined in a small room that measured eight by 12 foot. The Hughes told authorities that the air-conditioning was knocked out by a dog chewing through an electrical cord, but the investigators could not confirm that. It was unclear how long the power had been off but temperatures reached 100 degrees. The next morning, when the bodies of the dogs were found, some of the owners claimed that they were initially told their pets had run away. Jacqueline Heath, who lost three dogs, told ABC that her home would never be the same. Scene: The dogs were found dead on June 20 and authorities say they died from heat exhaustion . Deadly: It appears that one of the dogs chewed through the air conditioner's cord, switching off the power . Tragic: Questions have also been raised about the cramped conditions (dogs are pictured at the facility) 'It still doesn't seem real that I'm never going to see these dogs again,' she told CBS as she broke down in tears. 'We don't have them running around. We're never going to have them to cuddle.' A state grand jury also indicted Jesse Todd and Maleisia Hughes each with 22 felony and seven misdemeanor counts of cruelty to animals and one count of fraud for the incident. The couple, who own the Green Acre boarding facility in Phoenix, have pleaded not guilty. The felony charges carry penalties of up to 10 years in prison, Jerry Cobb, a spokesman for the county attorney's office, told Reuters, although most defendants receive probation in animal cases. 'This is simply the next step in the legal process, and I have confidence in that process,' Senator Flake said in a brief statement last month. A group of the dog owners also filed a civil lawsuit against the Hughes and the Flakes, accusing them of fraud and neglect. Loved: A makeshift memorial can be seen outside the Green Acre Dog Boarding house in Gilbert . Mourned: More than 20 dogs passed away in cramped conditions at the boarding facility on June 20 . The lawsuit in county Superior Court alleged that the dogs were confined in cramped quarters and faced 'neglect, mistreatment, physical injury and psychological abuse'. The dog owners claim that they were told the family would only board a few dogs at a time but a police investigation found more than two dozen dogs were in the small room together. 'Our clients were deceived, attorney John Schill told AZFamily. 'They were told their dogs would be boarded at a Disneyland-type facility, where the dogs would run free. 'In reality, it was 28 dogs crammed into a nine-by-twelve [foot] room, where they died.' The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages but the plantifs have said they aim to shut down the facility.","Austin Flake and his wife Logan, both 21, were in charge of her parents' dog-boarding facility in Arizona last summer when 21 dogs died .

"The Shield actor Michael Jace appeared in court on Thursday morning for a pretrial hearing over his wife's murder. The 51-year-old, dressed in orange jumpsuit and in shackles, took his seat at the Foltz Criminal Justice Center in downtown Los Angeles accompanied by his attorney. Jace is accused of shooting dead his wife, 40-year-old April Jace, in their suburban LA home on May 19 this year. He pleaded not guilty during his June arraignment. Michael Jace, who starred in TV show The Shield, appeared in court in Los Angeles on Thursday. Jace is alleged to have shot his wife dead and is currently jailed awaiting trial . Michael Jace is accused of shooting dead his wife, 40-year-old April Jace (left), in their suburban LA home on May 19 this year . The Shield actor waived his right to a preliminary hearing in August, meaning that the case will proceed to trial without an initial presentation of evidence to a judge. The couple's sons, both under 10, were home at the time and unharmed. The boys are now living with relatives. Police have not disclosed a motive for the slaying but have said they were looking into whether financial or other domestic issues may have been involved. The family of April Jace has called her death a senseless act of domestic violence. Police said Michael Jace called 911 to report the killing in their home in the Hyde Park suburb of the city. Audio of Jace's call has not been made public, but fire officials have released a 911 call from April Jace's father in which he says the actor told him he had shot the victim. Mrs Jace was discovered in the couple's home dead from multiple gunshot wounds to the upper torso. According to court records obtained by ABC 7, Michael Jace was involved in a domesitc dispute with his first wife in 1997. Jace, 51, made a court appearance on Thursday in downtown LA for a pretrial hearing over his wife's murder . Mrs Jace, 40, a financial aid counselor at Biola University, had three sons, including the two with Michael Jace. Jace is best known for his role as LAPD officer Julien Lowe on The Shield TV series. He also appeared in the TV show Southland and had small parts in such classics as Boogie Nights, Forrest Gump and Planet of the Apes.

"A schoolboy has become the world's youngest qualified computer specialist after passing a Microsoft Windows exam at the age of just five. Ayan Qureshi has only just started primary school, but  passed the test at Birmingham City University to become a Microsoft Certified Professional. In doing so he has  set a new world record for the youngest person ever to pass a Microsoft exam - at the age of five years and 11 months, beating the previous record held by six-year-old Mehroz Yawar from Pakistan. Computer whizz: Ayan Qureshi has become the world's youngest qualified computer specialist after passing a Microsoft Windows exam at the age of just five . Ayan Qureshi has only just started primary school, but passed the test at Birmingham City University to become a Microsoft Certified Professional . Ayan was first introduced to computers  when he was just three, by his father Asim, 43, who soon realised his son’s natural aptitude for technology. The IT consultant then built his son a computer lab at the family’s home in Coventry, West Midlands and started preparing Ayan for the complex Microsoft test. After just five months training, Ayan sat the 'Supporting Windows 8.1' assessment for IT professionals alongside several adult candidates, even though at five he will not be able to work for another eight years. Certified: Ayan breezed through the two hour 'Supporting Windows 8.1' exam at Birmingham City University . Workspace: Ayan was first introduced to computers when he was just three, by his father Asim, 43, who  built his son this computer lab at the family’s home in Coventry, West Midlands . Ayan breezed through the two hour exam in September and even finished with time to spare before finding out shortly afterwards he had passed. 'We are just so proud of him,' said Mr Qureshi. 'He has plans to take an advanced test in the future but he has to concentrate on school for now. 'He was very interested in computers from the age of three so I started explaining to him about hardware and software and installing programmes. 'I found that whatever I told him, he was able to remember it the next day, so I built a computer lab in our house for him to use, and he loves it. Certificate: The test is normally taken just before or after university by young adults aiming to be information technology technicians . Record breaker: Ayan has set a new world record for the youngest person ever to pass a Microsoft exam - at the age of five years and 11 months, beating the previous record held by six-year-old Mehroz Yawar . 'I showed him how to install Windows and then decided to enter him for this exam. 'It wasn’t easy teaching him every day but he picked it all up in the end.' When Ayan, now six, and his father arrived at the university invigilators were so shocked to see such a young candidate and they said he couldn’t take the exam. However, a phone call to Microsoft rectified the problem and Ayan took his place at a computer alongside the other adult candidates. 'There was just a room full of adults there when we went to take the test on a Saturday, but I’m not sure if they all passed or not,' said Mr Qureshi. 'He wants to keep on learning so I am sure he will be ready to take more exams quite soon. He’s incredible really. 'He enjoys playing computer games like any kid but now he is more interested about how they work.' Fun: Ayan's father says his son, now six, enjoys playing games on computers but is also interested in how they work. He hopes to work with computers when he grows up . The test is normally taken just before or after university by young adults aiming to be information technology technicians. Sections of the assessment included multiple choice, fill in the blanks, drag and drop, and several scenario based questions. The computer based outline test examined the applicants’ knowledge of hardware, software, and their understanding of how Windows works. And the certificate, which he keeps in his bedroom, shows he can use operating systems created by USA computing giant Microsoft. Ayan, who has a younger brother Rayn, three,  has also undertaken some distance learning lessons from London based computer training company IT Bolts. He was born in Lahore, Pakistan, but his father and mother Mamoona, 34, who is training to become a GP, moved to London in 2009. The youngster is yet to decide on a career path but hopes for a job involving his favourite subjects of maths and computing. Employment laws mean the youngest age a child can work part-time is 13, except children involved in areas such as acting and modelling, who can work as long as they have a performance licence. Children over 13 can work for 12 hours a week in term time, and 25 during school holidays.","Ayan Qureshi has passed the 'Supporting Windows 8.1' assessment .

"Lord Best (pictured) chairs the all-party group which has suggested a range of measures to help to free up more than 4 million family homes. Stamp duty should be waived for millions of pensioners to encourage them to downsize, a group of MPs said last night. They quote analysis that found a third of over-60s want to move into smaller houses – but are put off because of the large amount they have to pay in tax. It means they are forced to continue to live in family-sized homes which are far bigger than they need, and which are expensive to heat. The all-party parliamentary group on housing and care for older people said the answer was to exempt them from stamp duty on homes worth £250,000 or less. They could then move into smaller homes more appropriate to their needs – freeing up their larger houses for families who need more room. The Help to Move idea is contained in a report by the all-party group, which is chaired by Lord Best, the former head of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. It suggests a range of measures to help to free up more than 4 million family homes. ‘More and more people in their “extended middle age” are thinking about downsizing,’ said Lord Best. ‘This can mean much reduced fuel bills and maintenance costs, perhaps the release of some capital, and can prevent a forced move in later life. ‘Our report recommends a Help to Move package of stamp duty relief, financial advice and mortgage support – like the Help to Buy assistance for younger purchasers – to generate the demand that will get more high-quality homes built for this age group.’ Scroll down for video . The report cites analysis by the think-tank Demos that shows 58 per cent of over-60s – around 8 million people living in 7 million homes – are interested in moving. A third of over-60s specifically wanted to downsize, while a quarter said they were interested in buying a retirement property. The MPs say exempting older people from stamp duty on homes worth up to £250,000 would lead to a net gain to the Treasury because of the consequent moves in the property market. The report also calls for loans for older homeowners with lower value properties to allow them to get mortgages to buy higher-value retirement homes. Research found a third of over-60s want to move into smaller houses, but are put off because of the large amount they have to pay in tax - forcing them to continue to live in family-sized homes which are far bigger than they need and are expensive to heat . At present, many older people cannot access mainstream mortgage lending. The report said a scheme like Help to Buy, which helps younger people get on the housing ladder, could help pensioners at the other end of their lives. Claudia Wood, chief executive of the think tank Demos and author of the report, said: ‘Politicians from all parties are committed to helping first time buyers get onto the housing ladder, while ignoring the problems at the other end of the market. ‘Many older people would like to downsize and are stuck in properties that are hard to manage and heat. ‘A lack of suitable properties and the practical and emotional upheaval of moving can’t be underestimated – but affordability is a major barrier for many. ‘The government needs to commit to really helping this group of people with concrete policies – not just to ensure older people enjoy a better quality of life but also to stimulate their entire housing market by helping more older people move from family-sized homes.’ While some homeowners are lucky enough to be mortgage free, many people in their 50s will still have a home loan. If you are thinking of downsizing there are plenty of decent mortgage options out there to help you cut the cost of your monthly repayments. Even if you're not thinking of moving, with rates near record lows, it could be a good time to remortgage and reduce the cost of paying off your home before retirement - and even save the extra money into a pension if you want to.

"Convicted murderer and accused paedophile Phillip John Smith has been captured hiding out at an international hostel in Rio, Brazil. The New Zealand criminal escaped police custody last Thursday while on release from Waikato's Spring Hill prison  into the care of a sponsor, for a three-day visit. Smith had not tried to change his appearance during his time in Rio and a tip-off from a local who had seen his picture on the TV led to his arrest in the  suburb of Santa Teresa. Phillip Smith was pictured here leaving Auckland Internation Airport . The fugitive checked into the Cidade Maravilhosa youth hostel on Wednesday morning, where he shared a room with three other people. Smith was jailed for life in 1996 for stabbing the father of a Carterton boy he had been molesting to death. He  sexually assaulted the boy for three years, between 1992 to 1995, before he was caught. The fugitive looked relaxed as he handed it his passport. He travelled to Rio, Brazil on hi birth name, Phillip Traynor . It is suspected Smith took a taxi to Auckland Airport, got on a plane to Santiago, Chile, and later flew to Brazil. His half-sister Joanne Smith had sponsored the release of Smith and drove to the prison on Thursady, only to find hehad already left. It took Brazilian police  just five hours to arrest the 40-year-old fugitive, once the sighting had been reported. Smith was captured at the Cidade Maravilhosa youth hostel on Wednesday morning . Smith was led away by officials and has been remanded in custody for 60 days . Smith appeared in court in Brazil this morning and has been remanded in custody for 60 days. He is expected to be transferred to Ary Franco prison in Rio immediately. The notorious Rio jail was once condemned by the UN for its inhumane conditions. Smith's lawyer told reporters that his client may start his journey back to New Zealand as early as tomorrow. Smith had been sleeping in a six-bed dormitory with three other people for the duration of his stay . He said he was limited to what he could do for his client now that his passport has been cancelled. It has been reported that Smith's New Zealand passport has been cancelled and therefore he would have to be deported from Brazil. Smith travelled to Brazil with a passport featuring his birth name Phillip Traynor. Speaking to Radio New Zealand on Wednesday, Smith said he chose to travel to Brazil because he thought New Zealand authorities would have a hard time extraditing him back to his homeland. Smith is expected to be transferred to Ary Franco prison in Rio immediately . It has been reported that Smith's New Zealand passport has been cancelled and therefore he would have to be deported from Brazil . In a statement released to the radio station, Smith claimed nobody helped him escape and he decided to flee the New Zealand to get away from the 'vigilante justice system'.\ . Smith said he had used his bachelor of accountancy, bachelor of business studies and his finance major to fund his thought-out escape. Speaking at a press conference this morning, Detective Superintendent Mike Pannett told waiting reporters that Smith had shown little remorse or emotion since he was arrested on Wednesday. Detective Superintendent Mike Pannett (pictured) told waiting reporters that Smith had shown little remorse or emotion since he was arrested on Wednesday . 'I think he was surprised to see a New Zealand Police officer here,' Mr Pannett said. 'Having said that he has been very quiet since his apprehension, considering the situation.' He said Smith, also known by his birth name of Traynor, had been involved in criminal activity since the 1990s. 'We are very greatful to the Brazilian police for their prompt action in the apprehending and we are also greatful for the members of the public in Rio who have shown very good vigilance.' he said. Speaking to the New Zealand Herald, local journalist Alexandre Tortoriello said the convict had slept in a six-bedroom dormitory room with three other travellers. Detective Pannett said Smith did not expect to see New Zealand police in Rio . He also told the paper that Smith nearly convinced one of his room-mates in the hostel to bring him sightseeing in Sao Paulo. Smith was denied parole from Spring Hill prison in March with the board saying he 'remained an undue risk to the safety of the community'. The family of Smith's victims had been notified of his escape by police. Smith's sister Lyn told Radio New Zealand that she was 'relived' her brother had been found safe. She said she hoped he would stay in custody this time.","Notorious murderer Phillip Smith has been captured in Brazil .

"Greg Dyke said 'it was not clear cut' when asked about convicted rapist Ched Evans returning to football . Greg Dyke controversially waded into the row over rapist footballer Ched Evans last night when he said it was ‘not an important issue’. Speaking on BBC’s Newsnight, Mr Dyke appeared unprepared for questions over Evans’ comeback despite being chairman of the Football Association, looking uncomfortable as he told presenter Laura Kuenssberg the issue was ‘not clear cut’. His gaffe came after Olympic golden girl Jessica Ennis-Hill will ask Sheffield United to remove her name from one of its stands if the club re-signs Evans. Britain’s most high-profile sportswoman, honoured by her local team after the 2012 Olympics, said she would sever her links with the club if it hands a contract to Evans, who has been allowed to train with his former teammates. Mr Dyke, 67, is a former BBC Director General and well-known Manchester United fan. His comments provoked immediate anger on social media sites with Twitter users calling the interview a ‘car crash’. Matthew Whitehouse, a professional coach and football writer, tweeted: ‘For a man with a history in media he really is awful when it comes to PR.’ Sports journalist Oliver Holt tweeted: ‘Sorry, but if Greg Dyke goes on Newsnight, he should expect to be asked about Ched Evans and he should have a coherent view. That was a fail'. Scroll down for video . Jessica Ennis-Hill said she would ask for her name to be removed from the stand if Evans is re-signed . Leyton Orient fan Andy Campbell tweeted: ‘Did Greg Dyke really just make excuses to avoid answering anything to do with Ched Evans? Spineless clown!’ Evans was released from prison after serving two and a half years of a five-year sentence for raping a teenager at a hotel in 2011. Laura Kuenssberg (LK): As the leader of football in this country, should Ched Evans, who was convicted of rape, be able to play for Sheffield United again? Greg Dyke (GD): ‘I don’t want to go into that. That’s not what I’m here for. I’m quite happy to talk about this (Fifa), I don’t really want to talk about Ched Evans. ‘I think it’s far too complicated for five minutes here'. LK: But shouldn’t you be taking the lead? GD: ‘Here’s the straight forward question: Are people who go to prison entitled to come out and rebuild their lives or aren’t they? Or is what they have done so bad and they are in an industry where their image is so important and that’s the dilemma. And it’s a dilemma and it’s not clear cut. But I would rather talk about this (Fifa) if you don’t mind. LK: But it’s an important issue. GD: No it’s not an important issue. (talks over presenter) It’s not an important issue. (Pause) It’s an important issue but not in terms of what we are here to talk about. LK: Do you think that people will accept that you just don’t have a view? GD: What I will talk about is when you phoned me up to ask me to come on here you asked me to talk about this (Fifa) not Ched Evans. Ennis-Hill’s withdrawal of support could now be the ‘death knell’ to any attempt by the Yorkshire club to allow Evans to relaunch his playing career. In a statement last night, the athlete, 28, said: ‘I believe being a role model to young people is a huge honour and those in positions of influence in communities should respect the role they play in young people’s lives and set a good example. ‘If Evans was to be re-signed by the club it would completely contradict these beliefs.’ Her comments come after the resignations of former patrons Charlie Webster, Lindsay Graham and sixties pop star Dave Berry, amid fears Evans will be resigned by the football club. Miss Webster, 32, said she herself had been a victim of sexual abuse, adding: ‘I resign as patron of Sheffield United and Sheffield United Community Foundation, which is all about inspiring the next generation through sport. ‘No convicted rapist, as in Ched Evans, should go back to the club that I am patron of. ‘He’s not just going into a job. . . he’s influencing the next generation of young men who are currently still making their decisions on how to treat women and what sexual mutual consent is.’ Later, Sixties pop star Dave Berry had resigned from the club along with its last remaining female patron, businesswoman Lindsay Graham. The League One side confirmed on Tuesday evening that it had agreed to allow Evans to take part in training with their players, but the 25-year-old has failed to appear ever since. MailOnline understands the convicted rapist was due to start training in Sheffield yesterday - but he never arrived and today he was out shopping 50 miles away in Cheshire. The return of Evans to his old team has sparked a massive backlash. The club’s two female patrons resigned in protest and there was outrage from fans, campaigners and MPs. Two of Sheffield United’s top sponsors also threatened to tear up their contracts if he was permanently signed to the team. Mrs Ennis-Hill said she would ask for her name to be removed from one of the stands at Bramall Lane if Evans is given a new contract with the League One club .

'I believe being a role model to young people is a huge honour and those in positions of influence in communities should respect the role they play in young people’s lives and set a good example. 'If Evans was to be re-signed by the club it would completely contradict these beliefs.' Today Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg - a Sheffield MP - said Evans should consider moving abroad to play football because  United should not take him back. Mr Clegg said footballers were not ‘just any old employee, they’re also role models’. Yesterday morning she posted on Twitter: ‘Overwhelmed by the level of your support. 'I am so heartened to see that the vast majority are standing with me & saying that this isn’t okay.’ It is unclear whether Evans, 25, will play for the club again, but he will train at its grounds. He was released last month, still protesting his innocence, after serving half of a five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old woman in Rhyl, North Wales. Ched Evans and his fiancée, Natasha Massey, were seen emerging in exercise clothes today near their Cheshire home . Evans and Massey became engaged following the footballer's release from prison where he served half of a sentence over the rape of a teenager in Wales. Their outing came as patrons of the club resigned . The 25-year-old failed to appear at Sheffield United's training grounds despite being told he could return to train with former teammates, instead emerging in exercise clothing in Cheshire with his partner . Out and about: Evans was out in Cheshire close to the family home of partner Natasha, right yesterday, who was wearing her engagement ring . Last night campaign group the End Violence Against Women Coalition said it was ‘appalled’. Nick Clegg told LBC: 'If it was me, I wouldn't take him on. This is an incredibly serious offence, a very serious offence for which he has been convicted and that's what sets this apart. 'He maybe could play for a club abroad for a while before coming back.' Some 155,000 people have added their names to a petition demanding United, nicknamed the Blades, refuse to sign him. The team’s shirt sponsor, John Holland car sales, warned it would consider tearing up its contract if the Blades re-sign Evans as it ‘condemns rape and violence of any kind against women’. DBL Logistics, whose name is on the back of the club’s shirts, also threatened to withdraw its support. Paul Blomfield, the Labour MP for Sheffield Central, wrote in an open letter to club chairmen Kevin McCabe and Jim Phipps: ‘It’s because I care so much about our club that I am writing to urge you to reconsider your decision . . . The way this issue has been handled by the club is dragging our name through the mud and dividing fans.’ The footballer raped his victim in a Rhyl Premier Inn in 2012 after his footballer friend Clayton McDonald, who was cleared of rape, texted him saying: ‘I’ve got a bird.’ Couple: Evans, with his fiancee Natasha Massey, who he proposed to after he was released from prison last month, where he served half of a five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old girl . Evans, who has played 13 times for Wales, admitted having sex but denied rape. The woman said she had no memory of the incident and prosecutors said she was too drunk to consent. The family of Evans’s fiancee, Natasha Massey, 25, have helped to fund a highly controversial website claiming he is innocent. Evans, a former Manchester City player, moved to third-tier Sheffield in 2009 before being convicted in April 2012. On Tuesday, Sheffield United issued a statement saying there was ‘no place for mob justice’ in the situation. It read: ‘The board has decided to respond favourably to the PFA’s request and to allow Mr Evans to train at the club’s facilities. ‘While some have speculated about whether the club will or should invite Mr Evans to return to SUFC as a registered footballer, the club is not prepared at this time to decide that issue.’","Greg Dyke said told Newsnight presenter the issue 'was not clear cut'

"Privatisation: Nigel Farage was filmed during a 2012 tour telling supporters he believed the private sector offered better value for money than the NHS . Nigel Farage is facing claims he backs the privatisation of the NHS after he was caught on camera calling for a switch to a U.S.-style insurance-based healthcare system. In footage that has only just come to light, the Ukip leader was filmed during a 2012 tour telling supporters he believed the private sector offered better value for money. The rediscovery of Mr Farage's remarks will be a blow to Ukip as it tries to reposition itself as a party committed to following public opinion which is staunchly pro-NHS. It comes as he sensationally declared he would be prepared to prop up a Labour minority government if he could secure an agreement on a referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union. In an interview with the New Statesman Mr Farage declared that he would be ‘very comfortable supporting anybody that gave me an opportunity to get my country back’. The Tories immediately seized on his remarks, with a spokesman declaring that they showed that a vote for Ukip would lead to Labour winning in May next year. But just as damaging to his standing with voters on the left is Mr Farage's remarks on reforming the NHS. In footage shot during his 2012 Common Sense tour and obtained by the Guardian, Mr Farage said: 'I think we're going to have to think about healthcare very, very differently. I think we're going to have to move to an insurance-based system of healthcare. 'Frankly I would feel more comfortable that my money would return value if I was able to do that through the market place of an insurance company than just us trustingly giving £100bn a year to central government and expecting them to organise the healthcare service from cradle to grave for us.' A Ukip spokesman told The Times its policy had changed since Mr Farage's remarks. He said: 'Ukip believes our healthcare must remain free at the point of access. 'Previous governments have enabled huge chunks of the NHS to be privatised by the back door and it simply has not worked.' 'Ukip believes in seeking new ideas to ensure the NHS provides the highest quality of care,' he added. Sacred cow: A Ukip spokesman insisted that its policy had changed since Mr Farage's remarks and that the party was now committed to a healthcare service that remains free at the point of use . In the New Statesman interview, Mr Farage was asked by the publication’s editor Jason Cowley about the possibility of a deal were the party to secure eight to ten MPs at the next election, and whether they would join Labour in a coalition in return for an ‘in-out referendum’. A councillor who switched allegiance to Ukip has resigned as a school’s chairman of governors after the headteacher allegedly asked him to quit over his political views,writes Chris Brooke. Mike Ward, 71, has been a governor of the secondary school for eight years and never had a problem during his time as an independent councillor on Scarborough Borough Council. But five weeks after announcing he was joining Ukip Mr Ward was called in for a meeting by Sue Whelan, head of Eskdale School, and told he should leave his role because the party’s policies were ‘against the ethos of the school.’ She expressed concern about a news report concerning party policy on immigrants not being entitled to benefits or state education when they arrive in the country. The school has one immigrant family, he said. Father-of-two Mr Ward, a former teacher and retired marketing director, said he was ‘astonished’ and ‘upset’, but resigned as head of governors because he ‘didn’t wish to cause the school any further issues.’ Last night UKIP leader Nigel Farage said: ‘Mike is a decent and honourable man who has always had the interests of the School and the wider community at the forefront of his mind and it is absolutely disgraceful that he has been treated in this way. ‘This is discrimination pure and simple and I find it astounding that the head teacher has taken it upon herself to oust him. Questions need to be asked about why this has happened. In the meantime I stand with Mike and I can only hope the School sees sense and reinstates him.’ He said: ‘That would depend when the referendum was, and the terms.’ Declaring he was not ruling out a deal he added: ‘There is no left and right any more. Left and right’s irrelevant.’ Pressed on the issue, he said a Ukip-Labour-Lib Dem coalition was ‘extremely unlikely’. He appeared to indicate he would be reluctant to join a formal coalition, but said he ‘absolutely’ would consider a so-called ‘confidence and supply’ deal. Under such an arrangement minor parties would agree to vote for the government’s budget, any confidence motions and other key legislation in return for deals on other policy areas. Mr Farage said: ‘To be honest, the way I look at it now, I can’t see Ukip wilfully going into formal coalition with anybody. Asked directly if he’d be ‘comfortable supporting Labour’, he replied: ‘I’d be very comfortable supporting anybody that gave me an opportunity to get my country back.’ The Conservatives have promised a referendum on UK membership of the EU in 2017. Labour has ruled out a vote unless more powers are transferred to Brussels. In his Tory Party conference speech David Cameron argued that a vote for Nigel Farage would help Ed Miliband get into Downing Street. He told his party that ‘you could go to bed with Nigel Farage, and wake up with Ed Miliband’. Last night a Conservative spokesman said: ‘This is further proof – from the horse’s mouth – that a vote for Nigel Farage will deliver Ed Miliband in Downing Street. That means a return to more spending, more borrowing and more tax.’ A Labour Party spokesman refused to speculate on any deals, insisting: ‘Labour is aiming for victory and a majority Labour government at the next general election.’ Senior Labour sources insisted that ‘hell would freeze over first’ before Labour did a deal with Ukip.","Ukip leader caught on camera making the remarks during 2012 tour .

"Europeans are taking full advantage of their holiday entitlement as they enjoy far more time away from work than their peers on other continents, research has revealed. Employees in Europe earn nearly twice as many paid days of annual leave than their counterparts in Asia-Pacific and North America, who appear to be wedded to work, a study says. But while Europeans earn an average of 28 days off, UK employees receive an average of 26, while those in the US were given just 15 days off in the past year. Time to relax: American workers took advantage of 14 of the 15 days of paid leave they were offered . UK residents take an average of 25 of 26 days off but 75 per cent said they feel 'very or somewhat' deprived . And it appears workers in Denmark, France, Germany and Spain are best off. They are treated to 30 days of holiday entitlement every year and residents of all four countries say they have taken every day given to them, according to Expedia's annual vacation deprivation study. UK residents, meanwhile, take an average of 25 of 26 days. But Britons want more time off as 75 per cent of those polled said they feel 'very or somewhat' deprived when it comes to their holiday entitlement. In comparison American workers took advantage of 14 of the 15 days they were offered – an uptick from 2013 when US employees were offered 14 days and only took 12. But only 54 per cent of those polled in the US said they feel 'very or somewhat' deprived. The study found that Brits are the least likely to cancel or postpone their holiday plans because of work commitments, as only 24 per cent have done so – half of the global average of 50 per cent. When it comes to taking a holiday in the first three months of the year, those in the UK feel the most comfortable, second only to Denmark, Expedia said. Workers in Germany, Denmark, France and Spain are best off with 30 days of holiday entitlement every year . Brits are the least likely to cancel or postpone their holiday plans because of work commitments . Sixty-one per cent of Brits say they would switch jobs if it offered more holiday time and a further 33 per cent would prefer more time off than a pay raise. Expedia asked Brits what they would give up for a week for an extra week off: . And it appears Brits would go to extreme lengths just to receive more time away from work. They are the most willing in the world to give up showering for a week in exchange for an extra week’s holiday, according to the study. Fifty per cent said they would swear off junk food if it meant more time away from work, while 48 per cent said they would unplug from social media. A further forty-three per cent said they would give up booze for a week. Just 28 per cent would be willing to give up a week of sex. Elsewhere in Europe, Italians take 21 of 28 days of paid annual leave that they receive, the Dutch take 24 of 25 and the Irish take 21 of 22. According to the study, there are varied reasons why people do not use all of their days off. Nineteen per cent said their work schedule 'does not allow for it', while 18 per cent choose to bank or carry them over to next year. Europeans earn an average of 28 days off every year, according to the Expedia study . Eighteen per cent said they allow some of their holiday time to expire due to a lack of money and a further 16 per cent said they forego a holiday because it is too difficult to co-ordinate. Expedia surveyed nearly 8,000 employed adults in 24 countries across Asia-Pacific, Europe, North America and South America. It revealed a sharp disparity in holiday behaviour across continents. In Asia-Pacific, United Arab Emirates workers are given – and take – a full 30 days off each year, but their peers spent less time away from work. Nineteen per cent of the survey's respondents said their work schedule does not allow for time off . Tourists feed elephants with bananas during a tour in Kanchanaburi, Thailand . UAE employees take twice the number of days off as their nearest peers as workers in Asia-Pacific were offered a median number of 19 days off and took only 14. Even though they receive all of that time off, 73 per cent of respondents from UAE said they feel 'very or somewhat vacation deprived'. Thai workers are the most deprived as they receive just 11 days of holiday entitlement, although the study's true 'winner' was South Korea, where people took only seven of 15 available days off. Eighteen per cent said they allow some of their holiday time to expire as they have limited travel funds . Andy Washington, managing director of Expedia.co.uk, said: 'The vacation deprivation study looks at holiday habits across several different continents. While habits differ, the emotional impact of holiday does not. 'Somewhere between 80 and 90 per cent of people worldwide say that holidays make them feel happier, better rested, closer to their family, less stressed, and more relaxed.' He added: 'These are all emotions that correlate to a productive employee. So it's almost paradoxical: spend more time away from work, and you might just be a better performing employee.'","Expedia study analysed holiday entitlement for workers in 24 countries .

"Furious fish shop owners have slammed a council after it spent £3,000 of taxpayers' cash on a guide on how to make their chips. The six-page document goes into minute detail on how thick each chip should be, as well as recommending exact temperatures for frying and informing workers that fries should be 'golden' in colour. Chippie owners criticised Cheltenham Borough Council bureaucrats for the guide, calling it patronising and unnecessary. A council spent £3,000 on the guides on how to cook chips, which advises chippie owners to cut chips to at least 14mm, slightly more than half an inch, in width . Chip shop owners are advised that chips should be served when they are a 'pale, golden colour' The detailed document, written by the Food Standards Agency, explains to workers how they can 'make the food they serve healthier' while saving money. The initiative, launched by Cheltenham's local authority, then explains that the best chips are made  'using a cutter with at least a 14mm (just more than half an inch) cross section'. Chip shop workers are then told to heat their fryer to 175C before putting potatoes in, cooking them for 5-6 minutes until they are a 'pale, golden colour'. Despite the lengthy description on how long a chip should be cooked for - 5-6 minutes - the guide says it is sometimes better just to follow instructions on the packet. The guidance reads: 'Frozen chips may only take 2-3 minutes – businesses should follow the manufacturer’s instructions.' They should also make sure they wash their fryers and change their oil often. The council document also suggests using rapeseed or sunflower oils, which are 'high oleic' - or high in unsaturated fats. The guide also recommends using salt shakers with fewer holes in and asking customers whether they want salt on their fries. Andreo Michael, who owns Norwood Fish Bar in Cheltenham, said: 'If you've been in the business like me since 1980 you don't need to be told how to do chips. 'Some people might need telling, but I don't need them telling me what to do.' Chips tips: Banging and shaking chips before serving them can reduce oil for customers, the advice says . Chips should be fried on their own to ensure oil quality is not affected, according to the document . The document also advises on the correct oils to be used to fry chips, suggesting 'high oleic' oils . The six-page document, branded as patronising by chip shop workers, suggests using salt shakers with fewer holes and asking customers whether they want salt . James Ritchie, 28, who owns Simpsons Fish and Chips in the Gloucestershire town, said: 'We try really hard to make sure we know these things anyway. 'We have our food nutritionally tested so for us this would not be a good experience for us. 'I would go to the National Federation of Fish Friers for advice and not the council. They couldn't tell us anything. There is nothing they could tell us that we don't already know.' Gloucestershire County Council has allocated £40,000 to Cheltenham Borough Council to fund health improvement schemes in 2013/14 and 2014/15. The guide says: 'By shaking the chips and banging the wire scoop several times, you can reduce fat absorption by 20% and make your chips crisper. 'This is because chips carry on absorbing fat after they come out of the fryer. 'If you bang and shake you’ll use less oil, need to top up less often, and need to empty the drain in the chip box less often.' Just over £20,000 has been awarded to five projects in the town this year - including the so-called 'healthy chip' scheme, which costs £3,000. It is hoped that the scheme will help reduce the amount of oil absorbed into deep fried foods, consequently reducing obesity levels in low-income areas. A spokesman for the TaxPayers' Alliance branded the guide a 'ludicrous' move. He said: 'When we're trying to make savings it beggars belief the council is doing takeaway training. 'The idea that it's appropriate to spend taxpayers' money telling chip shop owners how to cut chips is just ludicrous. 'They must think again - even the beneficiaries of this bizarre scheme don't seem particularly keen on it. 'If the Council wants people in low-income areas to be able to buy healthier, but often more expensive, food it should think about cutting council tax.' Jamie Ritchie, owner of Simpsons Fish and Chips in Cheltenham, said the council could not tell him anything he did not already know . Chips should be served when they are a 'pale, golden colour', the document says (file picture) But Councillor Rowena Hay, cabinet member for healthy lifestyles on Cheltenham Borough Council, defended the policy. She said: 'The project is about encouraging and supporting takeaways in low-income communities to serve healthier food. 'Its aim is to encourage small takeaway businesses to implement simple procedural changes to the way they fry food so as to produce a healthier product. 'We want to actively encourage healthier eating in any community in order to reduce obesity and long term illness and this project will help in doing this.' According to the guidance, shops should use liquid oils, such as sunflower and rapeseed, heated to 175C before each batch, for 'crispier, more appealing chips'. The document's advice on cutting down on salt reads: . 'Lots of people are trying to cut down on the amount of salt they eat. You can help your customers to do this by doing these things. • 'Use a salt shaker with fewer holes – just ask your supplier if they provide five-hole tops. • 'Ask your customers if they want salt before adding it. • 'Don’t add salt to batter mix. If you buy batter mix, check the ingredients and try to choose one that doesn’t contain salt or sodium. • 'Read the label on foods like sauces, sausages and pies and choose the one with less salt (or it might say ‘sodium’). If there’s no information on salt, ask your supplier.' The advice on cooking healthy chips was also condensed into a two-page document, pictured here . Researchers claim the oil is essential when it comes to frying and it should be sieved and reheated at the end of every batch. The guide adds that 'the ratio of food to oil should be 1:6' and 'baskets shouldn't look more than half full'. Research suggests that most retailers complete a full oil change every 2-4 weeks, but this should actually be done after 20 frying hours, it explains. Chips must be cooked in a fryer without any other food contact and the chef should shake them and bang them with a wire scoop several times after cooking. Research suggests this simple movement can reduce fat absorption by 20 per cent, making the chips crisper. They are also advised to offer smaller portion sizes, 'for people with smaller appetites'.","Chippie owners slam council for guide which tells them how to fry chips .

"A judge has ordered divorced parents to pay more than $16,000 toward their 21-year-old daughter's college tuition - even though she hasn't spoken to them for two years. Caitlyn Ricci from Cherry Hills, New Jersey, sued her estranged biological parents Maura McGarvey and Michael Ricci for her fees at Temple University in Philadelphia and won. The decision handed down by a Camden County judge meant they had a deadline of midnight on Thursday to complete the payment. However the pair insists they are not handing over any money and are planning to appeal. Ruling: Caitlyn Ricci sued her estranged biological parents Maura McGarvey and Michael Ricci for the fees at Temple University in Philadelphia and won . Ricci, described as a 'rebellious teen', left her family two years ago after she was allegedly thrown out by her mother. She then moved in with her grandparents who are now paying for the lawyer who is suing their own son Michael - Caitlyn's father. For two years Maura tried to reach out to Caitlyn - sending her letters and writing her poems - but she never heard back. They eventually tried to file for an emancipation but the day before Mothers' Day last year, papers from Caitlyn's attorneys arrived at their home. Her parents claim she also purchased a car when she left the family home and subsequently demanded the money through her lawyers. Maura and Michael believe their daughter is just trying to get money out of them, however her grandparents insist they should pay up. Angela Ricci, Caitlyn's maternal grandmother, told 6 ABC's Action News: 'They just don't want to pay because they have to pay by the middle of the week. The balance they owe. This has been going on for two years. Her grandfather, who told the station he would not divulge the reasons behind the fractious relationship, has said that if they don't pay up, he believes they should go to jail. Ricci's parents' marriage only lasted two-and-a-half years after they fell in love as youngsters. But they decided to come to an arrangement in a bid to give their daughter could the best life they could hope for. Estranged: Her mother Maura says she has tried to reach out to her daughter for the last two years - sending her letters and poems - but has not heard back from her . Break down in relationship: Caitlyn was 'thrown out' of her house two years ago and moved in with her grandparents. They are helping to sue her parents, including their own son Michael, by paying for her attorney . Parents: Maura and Michael, who dioverced after two-and-a-half years together, believe their daughter is just trying to get money out of them . But, following the breakdown in the relationship, her mother told the station: 'What child does this? It's insane. 'From the time Caitlyn was a teenager she was a challenging child, but I think all teenagers are.' 'She comes from two loving families and she was given what she wanted when she was growing up,' her father Michael added. The judge in Camden County, New Jersey passed the decision citing the Newburgh precedent. It states that all divorced parents are required to contribute to their child's education, whatever their age. Ricci turned to attorney Andrew Rochester to represent her in the lawsuit. He said: 'Caitlyn really is a good girl. She is the nicest, sweetest girl. All she wants is to go to college. He added that the nicest thing the parents said about their daughter was that she was a 'spoiled brat'. The student's Twitter account reads: 'I am changed and now im [sic] stronger.' Frustration: Maura (pictured with Caitlyn) has said 'what child does this?' and says her decisions are insane .","Caitlyn Ricci sued parents Maura McGarvey and Michael Ricci for the fees .

A report into her death yesterday found she could have survived if rank-and-file firemen had been allowed to do their job and bring her out. One fireman had been lowered down while a paramedic was strapped up in a harness ready to follow. But bosses refused to use a winch to lift out the mother-of-two because they were slavishly following rules which said the equipment could only be used to save their own staff. Instead they waited through the early hours of the morning for a police  mountain rescue team to arrive. Mrs Hume was lifted out but died shortly afterwards from a heart attack brought on by hypothermia. Last night her stepfather Hugh Cowan, 69, said: ‘They need to ask why people are using health and safety as an excuse for failure, rather than a reason for success.’ The case is the latest example of emergency service personnel putting their safety ahead of those they are supposed to be rescuing. Ten-year-old Jordan Lyon, of Wigan, drowned in a pond in 2007 after two police community support officers said they were unable to help him due to health and safety regulations. Earlier this year coroner David Roberts said the emergency services must be prepared to ‘risk their lives’ after hearing how red tape cost vital minutes during Derrick Bird’s Cumbrian gun massacre. Mrs Hume fell down the 45ft mine . shaft, part of a coal mine that closed in 1926, at 11.30pm while taking a . shortcut home across a field near Galston in Ayrshire after visiting . friends in July 2008. She was found by her teenage daughter . before Strathclyde Fire and Rescue Service arrived and fireman . Alexander Dunn was lowered to the bottom of the shaft. The collapsed 60ft mine shaft in a field behind Alison Hume's house . Scene: Police at the scene of the collapsed mine in Galston, Ayrshire, where Mrs Hume was trapped for seven hours . Mrs Hume was . still conscious but had a collapsed lung, several broken ribs and a . broken sternum. While the rescue operation was in . progress, group commander Paul Stewart arrived as a media relations . officer. He assumed command after realising he was the most senior . officer there. His first move was to stop a paramedic  who was already strapped in a harness  from being lowered. And he refused to allow colleagues to . rescue her using ropes because they had not received the correct . training. Mr Stewart feared they could be sued if the mission failed. 'I found their . evidence bullish, if not arrogant, in their determination to justify the . subservience of the need to carry out a rescue to the need to fulfil to . the letter…brigade policy' Incredibly, he told a fatal accident . inquiry that the operation had a ‘successful outcome’ because the . casualty was ultimately removed from the shaft. Mr Stewart is still in the fire . service and is on the waiting list for promotion to divisional . commander. Strathclyde Fire and Rescue Service expressed ‘enormous . regret’, but refused to apologise until after the report was published . last night. In the report Sheriff Desmond Leslie . said Mrs Hume might have survived if she had been removed sooner. He . said Mr Stewart and colleague William Thomson were ‘focused on . self-justification for the action or non-action taken by them’ and did . not reflect on lessons that could be learned from the tragedy. The . sheriff added: ‘I found their evidence bullish, if not arrogant.’ Rescue operation: Police at the scene The sheriff criticised the fire service's failure to recognise the urgency of a rescue, noting the firefighter had told the inquiry 'there was not a huge concern about the time' Yesterday Scotland’s First Minister . Alex Salmond ordered a fresh inquiry. Mrs Hume’s mother Margaret Cowan, . 67, said ‘the public will lose all confidence in the fire service’ if . the inquiry fails to ‘lead to something positive’. She added: ‘Some . people have said to me that if the same thing happened again, they . wouldn’t even phone 999 – they would get a rope and do the rescue . themselves.’ And Mrs Hume’s father Ian  McEwan . described his daughter’s death as ‘a needless waste of life’.  He said . his granddaughter Jayne, 17, still had nightmares about finding her . mother, adding: ‘She knew when she cried down to her mum that she was . still alive.’ Alison Hume with daughters Sophie, left, and Jayne, right. She stepped into a disused mineshaft which had collapsed opening up a 45ft drop . He added: ‘I hope no other family finds themselves in the same situation as we did.’ And Mr Cowan said he felt the fire service’s apology had been ‘forced upon them’. He added: ‘I just feel have they been prompted by the fact that the First Minister has asked for an inquiry. ‘They did not seem interested in . apologising yesterday or earlier today. It’s difficult to see whether I . can honestly accept it under the circumstances.’ Former watch commander John Bowman – . who had been ordered to rewrite the rule book on rope rescues weeks . before the tragedy – yesterday spoke out against his former employers. Mr Bowman, 52, had warned bosses that . changing the rules to prevent firemen using ropes to rescue people was . ‘a disaster waiting to happen’. He said: ‘Many incidents you go to in . the brigade don’t end with a successful resolution. Sometimes the . person can be dead before you get there, sometimes you just can’t help . people. This was not the case for Mrs Hume. It’s not the fire service’s . finest hour.’ Last night the Chief Fire Officers . Association said there was no uniform approach to the uses of winches in . forces across Britain. However, it said that health and . safety legislation must not be ‘allowed to constrain incident commanders . when making decisions in dynamic emergency situations’.","Alison Hume left at bottom of collapsed 45ft mine shaft for six hours .

"Researchers have calculated a formula for the perfect TV episode – and found Downton Abbey consistently comes closest to the ideal. Although the last episode of Friends was voted top by the public, followed by Eastenders: Christmas Day 2007, analysts found Downton was scientifically superior. Studying the 50 most popular shows of the past decade, experts at Bournemouth University's Media School found the best recipe for an episode was 65 per cent drama, 12 per cent shocks, nine per cent comedy, eight per cent action and six per cent romance. Scroll down for video . Researchers have calculated a formula for the perfect TV episode – and found Downton Abbey consistently comes closest to the ideal . TV expert Boyd Hilton and analysts at Bournemouth University's Media School carried out painstaking research and found Downton Abbey season three, episode five - where Sybil dies, came closest to this. It contained 36 minutes of 'drama', 3 mins 10 seconds of shock and surprise, 1 minute 10 seconds of comedy, 3 mins 10 seconds of action and 2 minutes 50 seconds of romance. That equates to 78 per cent drama, seven per cent shocks and surprises, two per cent comedy, seven per cent action and six per cent romance. The study, commissioned by BT TV, found Desperate Housewives: Bang season three, episode seven was the most action-packed with 33 per cent action. Meanwhile, Modern Family: Hawaii season one, episode 23 was the funniest, consisting of 74 per cent comedy. The Friends episode which topped the poll of 2,000 Brits, was made up of 48 per cent drama, 29 per cent comedy, two per cent romance and 21 per cent shocks and surprises. The last episode of Friends was voted favourite by the public, but analysts found Downton was scientifically superior . TV reviewer Boyd Hilton said: 'What makes this research so exciting and unique is how it helps us work out why a particular episode is so powerful and unmissable. 'This is the ultimate guide to the recipe for TV Gold.' Delia Bushell, Head of BT TV, said: 'The small screen now rivals the big screen thanks to the huge number of gripping TV series, unmissable sport and box office hits available at our fingertips. 'As we launch the next exciting phase of BT TV we wanted to know what makes TV so unmissable. Through our research, we've cracked the code.' The most dramatic episode was found to be The Walking Dead: No Sanctuary (Season five, episode one) - 98 per cent drama. There was a tie for most shocking between Grey's Anatomy: Sanctuary season six, episode 23 and Dexter: Seeing Red season one, episode 10 - both with 23 per cent of shocks and surprises. Meanwhile, the most romantic was deemed to be Sex and the City: An American Girl in Paris: Part Deux season six, episode 20 with 28 per cent romance.","Researchers calculated a formula for the perfect TV episode – and found Downton Abbey consistently comes closest to the ideal .

"Drinking between two to four cups of coffee every day appears to reduce the risk of suicide in men and women by 50 per cent, according to a new study. Researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health reviewed data from three previous US studies and found the risk of suicide amongst adults who drank several cups of caffeinated coffee on a daily basis was about half that of that compared to those who drank decaffeinated coffee, very little coffee or no coffee at all. The study, of 200,000 men and women, examined data which outlined their caffeine . consumption  both coffee and non-coffee . sources – including tea, caffeinated soft drinks, and chocolate. Feel the buzz: Those who drink two to four cups of coffee every day have a 50 per cent less suicide risk compared to those who drink decaffeinated coffee, little coffee or no coffee, according to new research . However for the majority, coffee was the main caffeine source and over the average 6 and-a-half year assessment period,  there were just 277 deaths from suicide. ‘Unlike previous investigations, we were able to assess association of consumption of caffeinated and non-caffeinated beverages, and we identify caffeine as the most likely candidate of any putative protective effect of coffee,' said lead researcher Michel Lucas, research fellow in the Department of Nutrition at HSPH. Caffeine works by stimulating the central nervous system but may act as a mild antidepressant by increasing production of certain 'feel good' neurotransmitters in the brain, including serotonin, dopamine, and noradrenaline. This could explain why previous epidemiological studies have found a lower risk of depression among coffee drinkers in past, the researchers reported. In spite of the findings, the authors do not recommend that depressed adults self-medicate by increasing their caffeine consumption as an increase could result in unpleasant side effects. Despite the findings, depressed adults are advised not to self-medicate by drinking more coffee than usual. A previous study found an increase in suicide amongst those who consumed more than eight cups a day (posed by model) ‘Overall, our results suggest that there is little further benefit for consumption above two to three cups a day or 400 mg of caffeine a day,’ the authors wrote. The researchers didn’t observe any major difference in risk between those who drank two to three cups of coffee per day and four or more cups a day, most likely due to the small number of suicide cases in these categories. However, in a previous HSPH coffee-depression study, the investigators observed a maximal effect among those who drank four or more cups per day. In fact one previous large Finnish study showed a higher risk of suicide . among people drinking eight or nine cups per day.  Few participants in . the two HSPH studies drank such large amounts of . coffee so the impact of six or more cups a day of coffee was not . addressed in these two studies.","Harvard study analysed caffeine consumption of 200,000 men and women .

"They never imagined they would be living such a nightmare, but now the family and friends of American hostage Steven Sotloff say they are praying that his life will be spared by ISIS terrorists holding him captive. Chilling footage of the Miami-based freelance journalist was released on Tuesday as Muslim extremists warned President Obama that there would be another execution if the US continued with its bomb attacks on Iraq. Graphic images were released at the same time of the beheading of American photojournalist James Foley. Sotloff, 31, was paraded in front of the camera and held by the collar of his shirt as a masked operative warned: 'The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision.' Mystery: Steven Sotloff's parents hadn't heard from him since four months after he went missing a year ago . Horror: In another chilling warning, the executioner holds Steven Sotloff on his knees with his hands tied behind his back, by the scruff of the neck . Sotloff has been missing since August 2013, when he was kidnapped near Aleppo, Syria. The video yesterday was the first his parents, Arthur and Shirley, heard about Steve since December, according to the hostage's long-time friend Emerson Lotzia. ISIS terrorists holding the journalist had allowed him to contact his parents, although the details of their communication are unknown. 'They had no idea if he was dead or alive until they saw that footage. It was a mixed bag of emotions for his family. 'On one hand they knew he was alive. But now they can see what he's going through. It's every parent's worst nightmare. Lotzia revealed that he had spoken to Steven's father after the video's release, and he admitted he felt better before the tape was released than afterwards. Speaking to MailOnline, Lotzia, who is a TV sports anchor for West Palm Beach station WPTV, says he is horrified by what's happened to his former college roommate. The pair had shared a dorm together at the University of Central Florida, near Orlando, then an apartment together for two more years. Sotloff, who had been studying print journalism, decided to leave after his junior year and return to Miami. Top journalist: Sotloff's work had been published in TIME, World Affairs, and the Christian Science Monitor. The last story he filed was on November 26, 2012, titled Libya's New Crisis . Sotloff said he wanted to wanted to explore the Middle East. And within a few months was making the first of his many visits to that part of the world. 'He would spend long periods over there and pop back home to see his family for a month or so,' says Lotzia, who last spoke to his buddy in February 2013. 'We all thought he was crazy but he loved it over there. He didn't seem to be in fear that anything bad could happen to him. He became fluent in Arabic and mixed with all the locals. 'He enjoyed reporting on what was going in in the Middle East. He always talked about wanting to travel and tell the story of what was going on. It's difficult to believe he's being held hostage by this scumbag group. Sotloff's work had been published in TIME, World Affairs, and the Christian Science Monitor. The last story he filed was on November 26, 2012, titled Libya's New Crisis. 'He's a great guy and can get on with anyone,' continued Lotzia. 'He's funny and laid back and very smart - both book smart and street smart. Fear: Soltoff has been missing since August 2013, when he disappeared while reporting near Aleppo . 'I know he had a lot of friends over there, but he never mentioned a girlfriend . 'He wandered around without a care in the world and I don't think he made any attempt to hide who was and what he was doing there. With hindsight that might have made him an easy target. 'I couldn't believe it when I heard he'd been taken hostage. It didn't seem real. 'And even then we didn't imagine he'd be in any real danger because he's just a regular guy with no agenda and he genuinely loved the people over there. I can't imagine what he's going through and I feel so bad for his family. 'They were thinking positive until yesterday. If anybody can bond with their captors it's Steve, but who knows what kind of people he's dealing with? 'He's not the kind of guy to pick fights. He'll just do what they say. I'm sure he'll have tried to get on with them as best you can with someone holding you hostage.' Lotzia noted how his buddy had lost weight and had his head shaved in the video. 'I can't bring myself to watch the whole thing... that poor guy getting beheaded.' He added: 'We had a lot of great times together and I hope we can many more. Whenever he was home in Florida he would call me and we would meet for a few drinks. 'He's a quiet guy, not a party animal at all. And when he was away we'd stay in touch on Facebook. 'Steve's a fantastic human being, a fun guy. He loves sport, especially Miami Heat. I had some of the best years of my life with him at UCF. He liked to socialize and there were girls, but never anyone serious. Family crisis: This morning the boyfriend of Steven's sister Lauren,  Frank Castle (left) released a Facebook post urging people to sign a White House petition calling on the US government to 'do everything possible to free American reporter Steven Sotloff from ISIS in Syria and save his life.' Steven's dad Arthur (right) admitted he felt better before the release of the tape . 'We had long nights laughing... and heart-to-hearts when we'd cry together. Our first ever Spring Break we stayed at his parents' house and I met his sister, Lauren, which I why I feel so close to his family. 'I'm just praying he's going to be okay... we all are.' Steven sent out his last tweet on August 3, talking about the Heat. According to his account, he was living in Benghazi, Libya, at the time. He had previously lived in Yemen for several years. This morning the boyfriend of Steven's sister Lauren, Frank Castle, released a Facebook post urging people to sign a White House petition calling on the US government to 'do everything possible to free American reporter Steven Sotloff from ISIS in Syria and save his life.'

"Incredible new photographs have revealed the dramatic gun battle which broke out between police and the suspected Boston bombers in a residential street, leaving one brother dead. The images, taken by a resident of the Watertown street in the early hours of Friday, show the Tsarnaev brothers sheltering behind a vehicle and clearly taking aim at police officers. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, and his brother Tamerlan, 26, are seen running to a car for more supplies before hauling out a pressure cooker bomb they then detonated, filling the street with smoke. The photographs, taken on the eyewitness' phone from a third-floor bedroom overlooking the harrowing scene, are the first images giving insight into the fraught battle that left one brother dead. They come as Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who is recovering from a gunshot wound to the neck in hospital, told investigators that his older brother was the ringleader in the attacks. Scroll down for videos . Harrowing: Images taken by a resident show the suspected Boston Marathon bombers hiding behind a car as they engage in a dramatic shootout with police in Watertown last month . Battle: The eyewitness said the men ran to the green sedan, left, for more supplies such as explosives . Andrew Kitzenberg, who snapped the photographs as he sought refuge in his home, shared the dramatic images and details on his blog. 'I was in my living room working on my computer when I heard multiple ""pops"" coming from outside,' he recalled. 'At that point, I had no idea that I was about to become an eye witness to the biggest news story in the country. 'When I looked outside my window, I could clearly see two people (the Tsarnaev brothers) taking cover behind an SUV and engaging in gunfire.' He ran to the third floor of the home to seek shelter from the gunfire. 'As I ran into my room, overwhelmed by shock, adrenaline, and curiosity, I jumped onto my bed to stay below the windows but also have a clear view at the shooters and photograph the event,' he said. Threat: In another image, a red circle shows what the eyewitness believed to be a pressure cooker bomb . Escape: After detonating the bomb and filling the street with smoke, the youngest brother jumped in the car and ploughed towards the police officers lining the end of the residential street . Taken down: Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed in a gunfight with police on April 19. Dzhokhar, who was injured, was captured that evening . He described seeing the men jump out of a green sedan, which they returned to for supplies - 'assumingly, more ammunition and explosives'. In another picture, he highlights a dark object that he identifies as a pressure cooker bomb. 'The use of this explosive created an enormous cloud of smoke that covered the entire street,' he wrote. 'While the street was still cloudy with smoke one of the brothers started running down the street towards the officers, while still engaging them in gunshots. 'As he got closer to the officers, within 10 -15 yards of them he was taken down.' Kitzenberg added he had been unable to see whether police knocked him to the ground or shot him. Aftermath: When the gun battle was over, police rushed to where the green sedan was parked and announced there were other devices on the street, sparking a search . Site: This image shows a blast mark on the ground from where the pressure cooker bomb exploded . His brother then jumped in their car and barreled towards the police cars barricading the end of the street. Authorities said he ran over his brother, who was later pronounced dead. The images reveal the moment Dzhokhar headed for the police cars - dodging between two. 'The SUV side swiped both cars taking out doors and windows and ultimately broke through the vehicle barricade and continued driving west on Laurel St.,' Kitzenberg wrote on his blog. 'This was the last I saw of the black SUV.' The battle took place after the FBI released the brothers' photographs on Thursday - four days after they allegedly detonated two bombs at the Boston marathon, killing three and injuring 180. Recovery: As daylight broke, the witness took photos of the abandoned sedan and backpacks . Hunt: Police swarm the street to check all the houses. The witness' home was then evacuated . Close call: Mr Kitzenberg also shared this image of a bullet hole through his wall and chair after the shootout . The Tsarnaevs then allegedly shot dead a police officer outside MIT and hijacked an SUV, telling the driver they had New York in their sights. The car and suspects were then traced to Watertown. After the gun battle, Dzhokhar fled the scene and hid in a boat which was parked behind a home, but he was scuppered in his escape when the homeowner spotted him and alerted authorities.

"A father whose four young sons could communicate only in grunts when authorities rescued them from a filthy Denver apartment pleaded guilty to felony child abuse on Thursday. Wayne Sperling, 67, could spend up to seven years in prison when he is sentenced on December 30. He also faced other charges, but these were dropped in exchange for his guilty plea. He and his wife, Lorinda Bailey, were both charged after their sons, aged two to six, were found in sickening living conditions in their apartment last October. The abuse was revealed when an emergency room doctor, who was treating the youngest boy for a cut to his forehead, noticed that he was unwashed, smelled of cigarettes and had bruises consistent with pinching. Scroll down for video . Guilty: Wayne Sperling, pictured in November 2013, has pleaded guilty to felony child abuse after his four young sons were found living is sickening conditions last year. He faces up to seven years in prison . Authorities discovered Sperling, his 36-year-old wife and the boys living in an apartment filled with cat feces, urine and flies across every surface inside the house. Prosecutors say it one of the most horrific cases they've ever seen, but the state's child abuse laws kept them from pursuing harsher penalties because the boys did not suffer serious physical injuries. The youngsters were taken in by a foster mother and are improving, prosecutors said. They have never asked about their parents. 'Considering what they've gone through, they're doing remarkably well,' Denver District Attorney spokeswoman Lynn Kimbrough said on Thursday. That the boys are living together has 'helped them in their ability to try to recover from the horrifying neglect they were living in.' Sentenced: His wife Lorinda Bailey, 36, pictured last year, was sentenced to 90 days in jail last week . After they were rescued and given bagged lunches to eat, the boys acted as if they hadn't seen normal food before, Detective Teresa Gessler testified in Bailey's case. They patted the sandwiches and played with the apples and after an adult mimed eating an apple to encourage them to eat, they licked the fruit, she said. When the boys were placed with the foster mother, prosecutor Bonnie Benedetti said, they did not know how to dress themselves. Benedetti said they are still not all toilet-trained and their snack cupboard has to be kept locked to prevent them from hoarding food. The case  warranted felony charges because it was a repeat child-abuse offense. Cruel: The couple had already lost three children after being accused of child abuse in 2006 . Scene: The couple's apartment, pictured, in Denver was covered in cat urine and feces and dead flies . The couple, who have a 30-year age gap, lost custody of other children amid similar allegations in October 2006, after passers-by reported two young children playing in the street. The children mostly grunted and pointed to communicate, and officers found a home full of trash and rotten food. Bailey and Sperling pleaded guilty in June 2007 to misdemeanor child abuse in that case. Bailey was sentenced last week to 90 days in jail and five years of probation after pleading guilty.","Wayne Sperling could spend up to seven years in prison for the abuse .

"Schools minister David Laws said he backed 'sharp-elbowed parents' and urged headteachers to challenge parents who do not engage . Pushy parents who move house to get into the best schools today won the whole-hearted backing of the government. Education minister David Laws leapt to the defence of ‘sharp-elbowed parents’ who were only trying to help their children to succeed in life. Condemning a ‘tolerance of failure’ in schools and councils in many areas, he said parents who invest time in money in their children’s education is ‘exactly what we want’. And he suggested that where parents were not taking an interest, headteachers should 'drag' them out of their homes. The government has insisted more needs to be done to close the attainment gap between working class children and those with better off parents. Mr Laws said parental engagement with school and whether parents are in work plays a key part in performance in lessons and pupil aspiration. Surveys suggest middle class parents are prepared to pay up to 170 per cent property price premiums to live close to Britain’s top private primary schools. Property prices close to England’s top 30 state secondary schools are on average £31,500 – or 12 per cent - higher than neighbouring areas. It means poorer families often struggle to live in the catchment areas of the best schools. But Mr Laws refused to criticise parents who used their own wealth and ambition to improve their children’s prospects. ‘People sometimes do complain about sharp-elbowed parents and people who seek to invest a huge amount of money to give their young people opportunities in life. ‘But we shouldn’t complain about any parent who is doing those things – whether they’re in the state sector or the private sector. ‘To do all you can to help your children to succeed in life is exactly what we want everybody to be doing,’ he told MPs on the education select committee. ‘So I’m afraid that we can’t cap any of those opportunities. What we need to do is extend them to those young people who are not getting them at the moment.’ Middle class parents are prepared to pay up to 170 per cent property price premiums to live close to Britain's top schools (file picture) Headteachers should visit bad parents at home at 'drag' them into taking an interest in their children's education, David Laws said. The schools minister said parents had to engage more in what happens in the classroom. Last month Ofsted Chief Inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw said that the Government should consider rewarding 'good citizens' who knock on their neighbours' doors and demand to know why their children are not in school. He said: 'How do you financially incentivise these people to get up in the morning, knock on the neighbours' door, and say your children are not up yet, they've not had their breakfast yet, why aren't you taking them to school?' But today Mr Laws insisted it was a role for headteachers and not neighbours to ensure parents were involved. He said: 'We need more headteachers like Sir Michael Wilshaw used to be, the type of person who would, if he had problems with children and aspirations, probably go round to their flat and drag the parent out, not quite kicking and screaming, but to engage in education.' In 2010 David Cameron admitted he and wife Samantha were part of the ‘sharp-elbowed middle classes’ who took over public services like SureStart centres. Last month leading headmaster Anthony Seldon said rich parents should be charged £20,000 a year for their children to attend the best state schools. The head of £11,000-a-term Wellington College in Berkshire argued families should become liable for the fees if they had a combined household income of £80,000 a year or more. Making the wealthy pay for state education would end the wasteful and unfair gap between the academic achievements and career prospects of the richest and poorest children in the UK, he claimed. Tory Education Secretary Michael Gove has vowed to close the gap between private and state schools. Mr Laws said the attainment gap between white working class children and other students was ‘pretty disgraceful’. He added that it was ‘frustrating’ that in 2014, low aspirations and an ‘excuses culture’ still existed. Headteachers should be willing to go round to pupils' houses and confront parents if their school was facing problems of low expectations and aspirations, he said. Mr Laws added: 'There are obviously schools and local authorities in all parts of the country where aspirations are very high. And that will be based on good leadership in local authorities or schools or academy chains. 'But there are too many where even today, after all the pressure of the last government and this government, aspirations are way too low in local areas, in schools, in local authorities.'
