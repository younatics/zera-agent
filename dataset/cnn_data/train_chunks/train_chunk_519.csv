He might be a marked man but this artist has grand designs on becoming the world's first fully-tattooed head of state. Despite ink covering 90 per cent of Vladimir Franz's body, he thinks he is the perfect candidate to become president in his home country of the Czech Republic. Mr Franz hopes to replace Vaclav Klaus, who has been President of the Czech Republic since 2003, and has already mounted an election campaign. Grand designs: Artist and drama professor Vladimir Franz wants to become the Czech Republic's head of state . His appearance might give an unappealing impression. However the 53-year-old is actually a drama professor at a prestigious Czech university, a talented painter and a successful opera composer. He also graduated from law school and has a doctorate in law but opted against a legal career because of the former communist regime. Now Mr Franz, from Prague, is turning his hand to politics and has started a campaign to become the next President of the Czech Republic. The wannabe politician, running as an independent, is travelling around his homeland in a bid to get the 50,000 signatures required before the end of the year to run for office. And by Monday - after only his first weekend of campaigning - he had already racked up 8,777 signatures. Contender: Mr Franz hopes to replace current Czech Republic president Vaclav Klaus (pictured) He describes himself as a man 'with a sense of humour and an inner relationship to nature who never ceases to learn and expand his knowledge and skills'. The divorced father, whose Facebook campaign page has more than 23,000 likes, is confident the public will take him seriously and that he has a genuine chance of becoming the country's first publicly-elected President. Despite his intimidating image, his politics are moderate, promoting tolerance, human rights, democracy and encouraging the search for alternative energy sources. He told The Prague Post said: 'Politics, politicians and the state have become alienated from the people. Citizens are frustrated, and I fear radicalisation. 'Politicians and the state are not the same thing. They do not own the state, but should be its responsible stewards, hired by the owners once every four years. 'Those owners are the citizens of this country I think I have a chance, not only because I am non-partisan, but as a person without a tarnished political past and an individual free of links to financial circles and their interests. 'Gathering at least 50,000 signatures for my nomination will be a success, and it will bring hope. It would also be a strong signal that society is finally waking up. 'I understand I can be hard to read for many people, because until now I've only expressed my views through my art. Now I have to formulate them in a decoded language.'","Ink covers 90 per cent of Vladimir Franz's body .

Parents at a primary school are up in arms over a plan to send pupils home at lunchtime every Friday to let teachers catch up on paperwork. The move would mean children losing the equivalent of 16 days of education every year. Families are furious at the threat to their youngsters’ schooling, and also the prospect of having to pay for extra childcare. Controversial: Cottesbrooke Junior, in Acocks Green, Birmingham, proposes to close on Friday afternoons so teachers can catch up on paperwork . From January, the 355 pupils at . Cottesbrooke Junior School in Acocks Green, Birmingham, will be sent . home at lunchtime every Friday. More than 100 parents gathered at the school this week to voice their anger at the plans. PPA: The school says teachers need the time for planning, preparation and assessment (posed by model) Mother-of-one Alaine Lumber, 38, said: ‘This is not just parents having a moan about nothing. This is a vitally important issue. ‘We asked if the teachers would be . giving up 16 days of the summer holidays to make up for the 16 days of . teaching the children will be losing. We did not get an answer.’ Schools have a legal requirement to . ensure that all teachers are given planning, preparation and assessment . time during the day to help with their workload. But rather than spread this time out . across the week, the head at Cottesbrooke decided that grouping the time . together for one afternoon a week ‘will ensure that the children get . the best out of their education’.Parents, however, say the proposals are . simply a way for teachers to start their weekends early. They added that many parents  who . also have children at a nearby affiliated infants’ school would be faced . with the inconvenience of  two separate school runs every Friday . afternoon. On Wednesday evening, more than 100 . parents assembled at the school for a meeting about the plans, with . those in attendance claiming 95 per cent of parents were against them. One father, a 40-year-old banking . consultant from Yardley, Birmingham, said: ‘You could describe the . atmosphere as spicy. There were some very angry people in there.’ Nicola McLarney, 36, who has one daughter at the school, added: ‘My daughter will start to lose part of her education. ‘They said they will provide help for . parents who work, but only if both parents work. Because I work . part-time, I’ll be excluded.’ Another mother who was at the meeting . said: ‘It’s interesting the school chose a Friday afternoon to close. Why not a mid-week day? ‘A lot of the staff are young and a . lot of parents think it’s an excuse to let the staff have an extended . weekend.’ Parents also gathered at the school gates yesterday morning to . complain. Michelle Whitehouse, 38, whose son . Kane, eight, goes to the school, said: ‘It seems like a stupid idea to . me. How can they take away half a day’s education like this? ‘I couldn’t go to the meeting because . of when they scheduled it. They have already said they are getting . teachers in early, at 8.30am to  do this paperwork, so what has changed? If they need more time to do it they need to come in earlier.’ Mother-of-two Lisa Mountford added: . ‘The simple thing is the teachers cannot be bothered to teach them and . do their paperwork. They are just destroying our children’s education.’ 'Number one priority': The school claims the move would improve the education of their pupils . The half-day closing measure comes . just months after teachers were criticised in an Ofsted report for . failing the most able pupils at the school. A spokesman for the school said no decision had been finalised regarding closing early on Fridays. In a letter to parents, head teacher . Pearl Jones said: ‘We can assure you that the children’s education is . the number one priority and we believe that this method will ensure that . the children get the best out of their education.’ A spokesman for Birmingham City . Council said: ‘This is ultimately a school decision, with the board of . governors making a final decision. ‘Wednesday’s meeting with parents was part of a broader consultation on the possibility of altering the school day. ‘There is a legal requirement for . teachers to be given time to plan lessons.

This boy wouldn't have been allowed to have fun with a sparkler thanks to health and safety officers . Over-zealous ’elf and safety officers extinguished the fun for hundreds of families attending public firework displays at the weekend by banning sparklers. Families said they were ‘disgusted’ by the rules, which needlessly upset children and patronised parents. The Round Table group, which organised 70 firework parties this year in public parks and stadiums, has also spoken out against the rules, which it says it is bound to comply with. At one of the displays on Saturday night in Moseley, Birmingham, a large sign stated ‘Strictly no sparklers’ on site. Around 3,000 people attended, paying £5 for adults and £2 for children to enter. But anybody who attempted to light sparklers were told to extinguish them immediately. Gordon Avery, from Sheldon, Birmingham, who was there with grandsons Kieran, 13, and Elliot, 11, said: ‘There are so many kids here, if they are being supervised by their parents then I don’t see why it is a problem. ‘I’ve gone to fireworks shows for decades. It’s health and safety gone mad.’ Similar rules were in place at other Round Table displays across the country. At its fireworks party on Saturday night at Ascot Racecourse, stewards also warned members of the public not to light sparklers. The event website advised: ‘For your own safety, we do not allow you to bring alcohol or your own fireworks to the event. This includes sparklers: They are too dangerous where there are crowds and excited children.’ Cait Allen, chief executive of Round Table, agreed that banning sparklers was ‘health and safety gone mad’, but added: ‘It’s just the venues’ insurance companies. We have to comply.’ Health and safety officers extinguished the fun for many by banning sparklers at at least 70 displays (file picture) A major new campaign has been launched ahead of Bonfire Night to highlight the stress fireworks can cause to cats, dogs and wildlife.As research revealed that 49 per cent of owners say their pet is afraid of the noises of firework season, Ceva Animal Health UK is calling for veterinary practices and the public to back a major new online petition.The e-petition appeals for the Government to enforce all fireworks manufacturers to carry information about pet and wildlife safety both online and on packaging and is available at: http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/36648.Ceva, whose pheromone products Feliway and Adaptil are proven to help pets in stressful situations, has joined with TV vet Marc Abraham to highlight the extent to which pets are affected by loud noises at this time of year.Signs of stress in dogs include trembling, shaking, hiding behind furniture, barking excessively and trying to run away.  If the problem isn’t confronted at the outset it could result in long-term, serious noise phobias developing.Vet Marc Abraham says: 'Pet safety, health and happiness are serious issues arising on and around every Bonfire Night. During the year I treat a number of animals suffering from stress-related health problems - many of these originating from loud noises such as fireworks or an unsettled environment. 'All pet owners have a responsibility to prepare their dog or cat well ahead of Bonfire Night - employing preventative measures such as creating safe dens, adjusting normal walking routines to avoid the dark, and providing pheromone appeasing products such as Adaptil and Feliway.'If you own a pet, or live next door to someone with a cat or a dog, please make sure everyone's educated in animal welfare and safety when it comes to Bonfire Night.'Sarah Endersby at Ceva Animal Health UK, said: 'This will be the second year running we have called upon the fireworks industry to recognise its responsibilities when it comes to protecting pets and wildlife during what is the most stressful season for them. For example, many dogs find fireworks distressing and may go on to develop noise phobia.'Many owners will seek advice from pet specialists such as vets, vet nurses, pharmacists and pet shop staff. However, by producing warnings on the packaging, fireworks manufacturers can also help advise and guide pet owners to minimise the stress caused to pets.'","Families say that the rules imposed by health and safety officers needlessly upset children and patronised parents .

A Health Service hospital has been forced to cancel dozens of operations after a rat was found in its operating theatre. Pest controllers were called and a deep clean was ordered after the rodent was spotted scurrying in the room last Tuesday night. The operating theatre at King’s Mill Hospital in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, was not in use at the time, but more than 40 scheduled operations had to be cancelled for fears the rodent may have spread potentially fatal diseases. The rodent, which can spread salmonella and carry potentially fatal Weil's disease, was spotted at Mansfield's King's Mill Hospital, causing several operations to be cancelled . Rats can carry salmonella and the deadly Weil’s disease, also known as mud fever, which is spread by contact with infected urine and is thought to kill two or three people a year in Britain. The embarrassing incident will alarm patients, but hospital bosses insisted there was no longer any cause for concern, although the fate of the rat is unknown. Karen Tomlinson, director of operations, said she was shocked but said it was a ‘minor, one-off incident’. ‘As soon as we became aware the following morning, we immediately took steps to thoroughly clean and sterilise the entire theatre area and called in external pest control experts to completely eradicate the problem,’ she added. ‘We have apologised to any patients affected for the inconvenience caused. Earlier this year it was reported that a hospital patient was bitten by a rat more than a dozen times as he lay sedated . ‘We took immediate and comprehensive action to rectify matters and to restore services with the minimum of disruption. We are fully operational again.’ No other rats are believed to have been found on the premises. It is not the first time pests have caused chaos in British hospitals this year. A recent investigation found that hospital kitchens are failing to meet basic standards of cleanliness, with infestations of mice, rats and cockroaches reported across the country. At Lewisham Hospital in South-East London, environmental officers found ‘widespread mouse activity’ and an infestation of cockroaches, while at Wolverhampton’s West Park Hospital a dead rat was found in a cupboard close to where food was being prepared. In total, health officers found 541 out of 731 hospital kitchens were dirty and flouting hygiene rules. This year a patient was reportedly bitten more than a dozen times on his back and neck by a rat at a hospital. The family of Jason Ketley, 42, claimed he was savaged by the rat at a specialist care unit in Surrey, with staff spotting him stumbling around a corridor with the rodent hanging from his neck by its teeth. Nurses eventually knocked it off and killed it. The most serious concern about rats infesting hospitals is the potential threat of Weil’s disease, which is caught through contact with infected rat urine. Also known as leptospirosis, it is thought to have caused the death two years ago of British double Olympic gold-medal winning rower Andy Holmes after he fell into the water during a 26-mile sculling marathon in Boston, Lincolnshire. The latest incident at King’s Mill is another embarrassment for the hospital, which is struggling with debts. Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which runs it, lost almost £6million in the first quarter of 2012. Last month it emerged that about 120 breast cancer patients had been given false negative results  by the hospital, leading to many not receiving the treatment they needed.","The rodent was spotted at King’s Mill Hospital in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire .

"By . Rebecca Camber, Nick Mcdermott and Paul Bentley . UPDATED: . 11:49 EST, 17 October 2012 . Oxford Street murder victim Seydou Diarrassouba was due to stand trial accused of robbing a 16-year-old boy of his BlackBerry mobile phone, it emerged today. The 18-year-old appeared at Inner London Crown Court just a week before he was stabbed to death during the Boxing Day sales. It was alleged he robbed and assaulted Nile Downes in Clapham, South London, and assaulted Nile's brother Yafeu on September 29, the CPS has confirmed. Victim: Teenager Seydou Diarrassouba makes a gun salute while posing for the camera . He was released on bail and was due to stand trial in the New Year. If convicted, he faced a tougher sentence because of Nile's age. Seydou was knifed in the heart after a fight broke out between rival gangs in a trainer store. He was a member of the notorious London street gang ABM, which stands for ‘All ’Bout Money’, and the killer was believed to have been involved with the rival 031 Bloods. Territorial clashes between the two South London gangs have claimed several lives since 2007. On YouTube, the victim appears in a . homemade rap video in which he talks about guns and killing. Sealed off: Crowds who swarmed the crime scene yesterday were today kept at a distance by police as investigations continued . Patrols: A red police car passes by the branch of Foot Locker where the attack took place as police continued to comb the scene for clues . Clues: A forensics investigator searches the Foot Locker store on Oxford Street, as Boxing Day Christmas deals are advertised through the window . On Boxing Day he is believed to have . left his home on a council estate in Mitcham, South London, with other . members of ABM but the gang ran into their rivals . and violence that is usually restricted to deprived areas of London . boiled over in front of crowds of shoppers, tourists and families. Sportswear store Foot Locker became the battleground when the college . student was knifed through the heart before staggering outside and . collapsing in a pool of blood. Paramedics battled to save him  as . crowds of spectators filming the incident on mobile phones pushed . against police, trying to get a better view of  the dying boy. He died at the scene at around 1.45pm, the latest victim of London’s senseless gang violence. Just hours later, a second man aged 21 was stabbed in the leg on the . same street in what is believed to be a separate and unrelated attack. Last night detectives were examining . hours of CCTV footage from around the West End to establish whether . there may have been a confrontation earlier in the day between the two . gangs. Tragic: The 18-year-old victim, Seydou Diarrassouba, poses in a hoodie in a social networking profile picture, and right, in a picture issued by Met Police . Officers were also looking at video . from a number of stores in Oxford Street to work out the victim’s . movements in the hours before the stabbing, as well as examining reports . of thefts in the area. Police said the trigger for the fight . remained unclear, although there were reports that a row broke out over . which trainers to steal from the shop. Last night details emerged about how Diarrassouba was sucked into the violent world of gang warfare. Born in Merton, south London, in 1993 . to Muslim parents who came to Britain from the Ivory Coast in West . Africa, he was the youngest of three. Fatal stabbing: The scene outside Foot Locker on Oxford Street where the man was stabbed to death . Emotions running high: Police officers block a member of the victim's family from getting too close to the scene . Murder weapon? A lock knife found at the scene of the stabbing . Probe: Forensic officers in white boiler suits work on the scene as the investigation gets underway . Friends said Diarrassouba was one of . the ‘bright kids’ at Rutlish High School in Merton, before attending . South Thames College. His family, who live in a rundown tower-block on . the outskirts of Mitcham, south London, were last night too devastated . to speak. But a series of disturbing images and . videos seen by  the Daily Mail reveal the  teenager glorifying violence . and smoking what appears to be a ‘blunt’ – slang for a rolled up . cigarette containing cannabis. Known by the nicknames ‘Nutz’ and ‘TunaRaw’, he was an active gang member for at least two years. Many teenagers who lived near him would avoid him, aware he was part of the ABM gang and could be armed. Earlier this month, one  teenager said he had witnessed Diarrassouba and . a fellow  gang member attack another group of boys at a house party in . Croydon, simply because they were from an opposing faction. The three victims of the assault were left with bloodied lips and bruised faces. One associate said: ‘He may well pretend to be an angel at home, but . he’s hardly going to go home and threaten his mother. Seydou was a . completely different person when he was with his friends, but that’s . gang life. ‘Around other members  he was a bubbly character,  but not when he came across his enemies. That was a  different story. ‘You certainly couldn’t trust him. He had a cold and ruthless side to . him, and could turn on you in an instant if you were not one of his . own.’ Eleven people - including a boy of 16 - have been arrested in connection . with the murder, but police are still trying to trace a number of those . involved in the attack. All 11 have been released on bail and will return to London police stations in mid-January.

Alf Webber from the Warton Royal British Legion is pleased that North Warwickshire Council has backed down . Every year since the guns fell silent, the Warton Royal British Legion have honoured their fallen colleagues with a march through the village. That was until they ran into... an event plan, risk assessment forms, emergency contact details, marshals, traffic management procedures, road closure applications, an evacuation plan and public liability insurance. The veterans were issued with the extraordinary list after the council ruled they could not hold their annual parade on Remembrance Sunday because they had failed to fill in the correct paperwork. Instead, officials insisted the veterans would have to replace their proud march on the street to lay wreaths with a stroll along the pavement instead. Although the list has been withdrawn after a campaign from outraged villagers in Warton, North Warwickshire, the men must still fill in risk assessment forms. Terry Casey, a former Royal Air Force mechanic and the Legion’s branch secretary, said of the parade, which has been held for more than 80 years: ‘It’s the first year we’ve had to do all this. ‘I didn’t deal with anything like that when I was in the RAF. It is less than five minutes to the memorial. Then we hold the Act of Remembrance, then it’s a short march back – ten minutes at the most. ‘We’ve been told we have to marshall the event ourselves. But with only seven members, there’d be no one left.’ Legion membership secretary Alf Webber added: ‘I wouldn’t have walked on the footpath,  I’d have walked straight up the road regardless.’ A spokesman for the local council said: ‘The parade will go ahead. We’ve offered to help with the risk assessment.’ A spokesman for Warwickshire Police added: ‘We have the highest regard for the Royal British Legion and all those involved in the organisation of the annual events and throughout Warwickshire officers will be joining them on November 11 to pay our respects to those who have lost their lives in conflict.’ Last year's Remembrance Sunday is marked in Warton .

Former Nottinghamshire Pc Simon Jones admitted having sexual relationships with two victims of crime, and has been jailed for two years . A former police officer has been jailed for two years for misconduct in a public office after admitting to having sexual relationships with victims of crime. Former Nottinghamshire PC Simon Jones slept with one woman while on duty and in uniform after taking a statement at her home - and a second while on his way into work for a night shift. A court heard the 33-year-old, who wept as the offences against him were outlined, targeted the 'vulnerable' women with 'unparalleled persistence, vigour and enthusiasm'. He pleaded guilty to two counts of misconduct in a public office at a hearing at Nottingham Crown Court in October. The 32-year-old, who moved to South Wales after resigning from Nottinghamshire Police in September, was sentenced yesterday to two years in prison at Nottingham Crown Court. After the case, senior officers said his behaviour was 'reprehensible' and a 'shocking abuse of power'. The hearing was told Jones was based at Worksop police station in Nottinghamshire. His first victim was a mother-of-two who complained in March 2011 that her violent ex-partner had attacked her. Jones targeted a second woman, aged 37, in March 2012 when he went to investigate after a window at her home had been smashed. Nottingham County Court heard how Jones targeted the 'vulnerable' women with 'unparalleled persistence, vigour and enthusiasm' When detectives examined Jones’ phone, they found personal details of four other women, one of whom he had exchanged 2,531 texts with. Jonathan Straw, prosecuting, said: 'He patently pursued these women he met during his role as a police officer. He is a predatory man who pursued the women with unparalleled persistence, vigour and enthusiasm.' Following the sentencing, Detective Superintendent Jackie Alexander, head of the Force’s Professional Standards Directorate, said: 'What Simon Jones did goes against everything that we, as a police force, stand for. 'Jones should have been there to protect vulnerable people and uphold the law, not take advantage of their situation for his own sexual gratification. 'It is right that he has been sent to prison for his conduct; he abused his position of trust and failed to meet the high standards of integrity and professionalism that we expect from all our employees. 'We continue to support Jones’ victims in dealing with a number of issues that coming forward has meant for them. I hope that today’s sentencing shows how seriously the Force deals with the behaviour of this nature and that no one is above the law.'",PC Simon Jones pursued the women with 'unparalled vigour and enthusiasm'

Patients have unleashed their fury at a surgeon suspected of botching 1,000 breast cancer operations. One woman, who was among scores allegedly given a needless mastectomy by Ian Paterson, said: ‘Put him in a room with all 1,000 of us and let us hack away at his body.’ Others said Mr Paterson, 54, had robbed them of their femininity. The surgeon has been suspended from his job and is being investigated by police over allegations that he convinced 450 healthy women to have operations they did not need. He is also accused of performing partial mastectomies on a further 700 patients – which may have increased the likelihood of them developing cancer. Some of the women said they felt mentally tortured by being made to think for years that they had a dreaded disease when they were, in fact, perfectly healthy. One woman even planned her funeral. Some are demanding compensation, while others are seeking criminal charges, arguing that a man who attacked them with a knife in the street would face jail. Gail Boichat, a 57-year-old mother of three, who had an unnecessary mastectomy in 1995, said Mr Paterson should face the wrath of his patients. ‘He should be put in a room with the women he has operated on. With all 1,000 of them, that’s how we feel,’ she said. A friend added: ‘We always say that. See what they do to him. Hack away bits of his body bit by bit like he did.’ 'Victims': Gail Boichat, 57, left, said the surgeon should be put in a room with the women he has operated on, while Helen Gardiner, right, 41, said she felt like she had been 'assaulted' Mrs Boichat, who is married to Alan, a . 60-year-old construction manager, was treated by Dr Paterson at the . Good Hope NHS hospital in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands. He . told her a lump in her right breast was cancerous and performed a . cleavage-sparing mastectomy, which leaves some breast tissue behind for . cosmetic reasons. The operation goes against national surgical . guidelines because it increases the risk of cancer returning but Mrs . Boichat was unaware of anything unusual. 'Put him in a room with all 1,000 of us and let us hack away at HIS body' A patient of surgeon Ian Paterson . Mr . Paterson also prescribed tamoxifen, a strong cancer drug which caused . Mrs Boichat, who was 40 at the time, to go through a traumatic early . menopause. This . February she was recalled to hospital and told the lump in her breast . was a blocked duct rather than cancer and that she should never have had . her mastectomy. Yesterday, . Mrs Boichat described how the news had left her feeling angry, confused . and guilty at having received sympathy from friends for so long. Not . having her right breast was a constant cause of self-consciousness, she . said, adding: ‘There’s the scar to remind you. Now it reminds me that I . shouldn’t have had it and that I should look like any other woman. You . can’t help it making you feel less feminine.’ Victoria Weaver, 42, said she planned her funeral after Mr Paterson told her she had cancer . Helen . Gardiner, 41, who runs her own recruitment company, found out last . month that she was operated on by Mr Paterson five times unnecessarily. The . mother of four, from Castle Bromwich, Birmingham, was told each time . that she had pre-cancerous lumps in her breast but has since seen . pathology reports that show only healthy tissue was removed. She . was also recommended for a mastectomy by Mr Paterson but says she . refused because she thought that was ‘drastic’ considering the supposed . lumps were not cancerous. ‘I . don’t think a lot of people have ever experienced this. It’s a bit like . Harold Shipman,’ she added. ‘I put my trust in him. I feel extremely . angry. He endangered my life. I feel like I’ve been assaulted.’ She said the surgeon should face criminal charges.

Focusing on the positive: Obama said that he hoped that by the end of the investigation the scandal would just be a side note to the legacy of Petraeus' long career . He said that he did feel it appropriate to 'meddle' in the FBI's process, referring all further logistical questions about the timeline of the investigation. Troublesome twosome: David Petraeus (left) resigned over his affair with Paula Broadwell (right) 'I am withholding judgment with respect to how the entire process surrounding General Petraeus came up. We don’t have all the information yet, but I want to say I have a lot of confidence generally in the FBI,' he said. When asked by NBC's Chuck Todd whether he felt that he- and voters- should have been told earlier than November 8: 'It is also possible that had we been told, you'd be sitting here asking why we were interfering with a criminal investigation.' The White House first learned about the investigation into Petraeus' affair with Paula Broadwell- and the ensuing chain of harassing emails from Broadwell to another four-star general and a possible love rival- on Wednesday November 7, the day after Obama was re-elected. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told unspecified staffers at the White House on Wednesday, telling them that there was a chance that the CIA director may resign. President Obama himself was not actually told anything about the investigation until Thursday. The President spoke with Petraeus that day, but did not immediately accept his resignation. He waited until Friday to allow him to quit, and it was announced publicly that same day.

But no passengers were on board to enjoy the stunning scenery as the locomotive involved was just a two-inch high model. Photographer Jeff Friesen placed the replica 1955 Canadian Pacific Railways 'Streamliner' at different locations across Canada to showcase the country's incredible natural beauty. Miniature: The view from this train as it travels through Five Islands, Nova Scotia, in Canada, is spectacular - but sadly no passengers will be enjoying it as it is just a two-inch high model . Soaking: The train, seen here teetering on a branch at Luskville Falls, in Gatineau Park, Quebec, was taken on a tour of Canada by its owner Jeff Friesen . Dramatic: Mr Friesen used the model train - pictured here on a farm near Brandon, Manitoba - to showcase Canada's breathtaking natural beauty . From a dramatic stone outcrop skirting the sea in Five Islands, Nova Scotia, to a field of corn in Manitoba, the incredible images show the huge contrasts in landscapes across Canada. To the untrained eye the train looks to be moving through the countryside, often on some of the most inhospitable terrain. Giveaways of the train's true size include a tree root pictured arching over the track in Rock Lake, Algonquin Provincial Park, in Ontario and the wooden rail of a bird viewing platform in Chaplin, Saskatchewan. Lake view: the 1955 vintage model appears to be travelling across the water as it skirts the shore of Lake Louise, Banff National Park, in Alberta . Fog Forest: In this image the 'Canadian Pacific' train is seen apparently climbing a moss-laden hill as a huge waterfall thunders beside it. The photo was taken in Fundy National Park, near Alma, New Brunswick . 'Golden Harvest: They may look like trees but in this picture the train is seen weaving through a field of corn on the outskirts of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada . Mr Friesen said his work, entitled The Canadian: Ghost Train Crossing . Canada, evolved from his wish to showcase his native country. 'I started The Canadian project to show Canada from an unexpected vantage point,' he said. 'The . journey has a surprise twist: I carry the train rather than it carrying . me. At just two inches tall, it fits into a shopping bag. 'While it is tempting to document such a huge country from a . helicopter or plane (in fact, it has been done several times) I wanted . to get closer to the heart of the land. Two inches off the ground seemed . about right.' 'Algonquin Morning': A tree root arches over the track as the train is pictured on the shore of Rock Lake, Algonquin Provincial Park, in Ontario . 'Prairie Skyway': It looks like a huge wooden bridge, but in fact this picture shows the train perched on a a bird watching tower near the town of Chaplin, Saskatchewan . Rocky terrain: The model is shown disappearing into what looks like a mountain tunnel on the shore of Lake Huron in Bruce Peninsula National Park, Ontario . Mr Friesen said the model train . provides 'a vehicle for the journey's visual narrative, linking far . places with a ribbon of tiny steel rails.' The . model is an exact scaled-down replica of the 1955 Streamliner that was . first named 'The Canadian,' which travelled the route between Montreal . and Vancouver. 'There is some peril in introducing a model train to the full scale . world,' said Mr Friesen. 'The Crossing': The train is partly obscured as it sits under a waterfall in Black Brook Beach, Ingonish, Nova Scotia . 'Salish Sea': A pile of what looks like driftwood provides part of the dramatic backdrop to this photograph on Dallas Road Beach, Victoria, in British Columbia . 'Totem Forest': The blurry image of a totem pole can be seen overlooking the model as it appears to be travelling over rocky terrain in Stanley Park, Vancouver, British Columbia . The train fell . into a fast moving stream in Nova Scotia while in Algonquin Park, Ontario, it tumbled . from a log into a marsh of 'thick mud and dark water.' 'I had to . feel for the train in the bog's murky depths,' said Mr Friesen. The photos will be particularly interesting for model train enthusiasts - most of whom could only dream of running their miniature collections through such dramatic scenery. 'Early Autumn': The autumnal shades on the distant trees are captured by the sun in this beautiful image taken at Taylor Lake, Gatineau Park, in Quebec . 'Tree Bridge': the train looks to be making its way over a moss-covered log in this picture, taken in La Mauricie National Park, Quebec . Mystical: These small stones are made to look like huge rocky outcrops by the model train as it was balances on a log in Cape Breton Highlands National Park, Nova Scotia .

For many passengers, the dream is to board a plane and turn left into business class. But a dramatic TV documentary appears to have taken away some of the attraction. On the Channel 4 show, scientists crashed a Boeing 727 carrying test dummies into the Mexican desert. Scroll down for video . Wreckage: The jet smashed into the Mexican desert for the show last month to explore a serious but survivable crash-landing and to find out where people should sit to give themselves the best chance of survival . Smashed up: A team of scientists, pilots and safety experts used crash test dummies to show those at the front of the airliner had the least chance of survival while anyone sitting in seat 7A would have certainly died . They found that those in the back of the plane were more likely to survive the impact. Online travel agent Sunshine.co.uk . said more than 400 customers had requested seats at the back of a plane . since the programme aired. Spokesman Chris Clarkson said: ‘The programme has certainly had an effect on those who watched it as we’ve seen by the recent . enquiries from customers panicking about where they’d be sat on the . plane. ‘Obviously, that’s ultimately something . you arrange through the airline itself, or at the check-in desk. 'Many . airlines don’t have designated seats and it just depends on when you get . on the plane.’ Brace position: The jet, which can carry up to 170 passengers, contained only crash-test dummies and dozens of interior cameras to film the sequence . Mr Clarkson . added: ‘People should remember that plane crashes are rare and try not . to worry about where they are sat - instead trying to focus on their . exciting holiday ahead.’ The company also said it had 50 calls from passengers worried about being given seat 7A. In the test crash, this seat was catapulted 500ft from the plane, which would have meant certain death for an occupant. It also said there had been a 63 per cent drop in requests for first-class travel. On the programme, scientists simulated the most common type of aviation accident – a forced landing. Selection: In a macabre twist to the show last month, people logged into Facebook to 'check-in online' and chose where they would have sat on the flight . A pilot flew the 727 before parachuting out. Scientists then crashed the plane by remote control. Experts used sensors, cameras and dummies with ‘breakable bones’ to assess the impact on the plane and passengers.

The programme’s conclusion was that . despite having the best seats and service on the plane, being in first . or business class makes you less likely to survive a crash landing. The . experiment was designed for scientists to study the crash-worthiness of . the aircraft's airframe and cabin as well as the impact of crashes on . the human body.

The last time was in 1984 when NASA teamed up with the FAA to crash a Boeing 720 into the Mojave Desert in California. Sanjay Singhal, executive producer of the documentary, said before it aired: 'We felt the time was right to do it again.

Pioneer: Steve Sabol, along with his father, have introduced a series of innovations now taken for granted . NFL Films President Steve Sabol, half of the father-son team that revolutionized sports broadcasting and mythologized pro football into the country's favorite sport, has died from brain cancer. He was 69. In March 2011, Sabol was diagnosed with a tumor on the left side of his brain after being hospitalized for a seizure. His father, Ed, founded NFL Films, and Steve was there working beside him right from the start in 1964. They introduced a series of innovations now taken for granted today, from slow-motion replays to blooper reels to sticking microphones on coaches and players. And they hired the 'Voice of God,' John Facenda, to read lyrical descriptions in solemn tones. 'Steve Sabol was the creative genius behind the remarkable work of NFL Films,' NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement from the league confirming Sabol's death. 'Steve's passion for football was matched by his incredible talent and energy. Steve's legacy will be part of the NFL forever. He was a major contributor to the success of the NFL, a man who changed the way we look at football and sports, and a great friend.' Ed Sabol was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame last year. The two received the Lifetime Achievement Emmy from the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences in 2003. 'We see the game as art as much as sport,' Steve Sabol told The Associated Press before his father's Hall induction. Father and son: Steve Sabol, left, worked with his father Ed, right, at NFL Films after Ed started the company in 1964 . 'That helped us nurture not only the game's traditions but to develop its mythology: America's Team, The Catch, The Frozen Tundra.'

Honoured: Sabol received 35 Emmys for writing, cinematography, editing, directing and producing . He began his career as a cinematographer under his father. Steve was the perfect fit for the job: an all-Rocky Mountain Conference running back at Colorado College majoring in art history. 'His work humanized the players, coaches and people who have made the National Football League so great,' said San Francisco 49ers CEO Jed York. The Sabols' advances included everything from reverse angle replays to filming pregame locker room speeches to setting highlights to pop music. 'Today of course those techniques are so common it's hard to imagine just how radical they once were,' the younger Sabol told the AP last year. 'Believe me, it wasn't always easy getting people to accept them, but I think it was worth the effort.' An accomplished collage artist, Sabol exhibited at the ArtExpo in New York, the Avant Gallery in Miami, the Govinda Gallery in Washington, the Milan Gallery in Fort Worth, Texas, and the Garth Davidson Gallery in Moorestown, N.J. It was Steve's high school football games in Philadelphia that gave Ed his only experience filming sports before he won the rights to chronicle the 1962 NFL championship game. 'This is a sad day for football fans everywhere,' Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay said. 'As someone who grew up watching NFL Films creations, I can attest to Steve's vision and contribution to the incredible popularity of this sport.

Loyal: Steven Tyler, 29, was dismissed after 11 years working for the supermarket . A loyal Sainsbury’s worker who was sacked after leaving the store for just two minutes to get change for a coffee has received a £10,000 payout. Steven Tyler, 28, had worked as a baker at the supermarket for 11 years when he was dismissed for leaving his post during a night shift. CCTV footage captured him walking out the back of the store on August 24 last year. He was fired after his manager told him he did not have permission to leave, an offence which amounted to ‘gross misconduct’. Mr Tyler, from Kidderminster, Worcestershire, was paid out around £10,000 in lost earnings and severance pay after winning his claim for wrongful dismissal. After winning his case on Wednesday, Mr Tyler said: ‘I will never set foot in Sainsbury’s again. ‘I had worked there for 11 years and you expect some support after working there for so long. ‘I just went out to get some money so I could get a coffee to keep me going through the night shift but they treated me like a criminal. ‘It was disgusting the way I was treated and I’m relieved they have been made to pay up.’ Mr Tyler was working at the Sainsbury’s branch in Kidderminster when he was transferred to a store in Amblecote, Stourbridge, Worcestershire while the shop underwent a refurbishment.

He said: ‘I’d got a lift with a friend but I’d left my coat with all my money in it in his car so just nipped out for less than two minutes to collect it. ‘When I walked back into the store my manager asked me where I had been and claimed he’d never given me permission to leave my post. Dismissal: Mr Tyler was fired after leaving the Sainsbury's store in Stourbridge for less than two minutes during a night shift . ‘I was the subject of a disciplinary where CCTV was used showing me walking into the car park which I never disputed, but they claimed I was guilty of gross misconduct and I was sacked. ‘What is most galling is that Sainsbury’s have a policy allowing smokers to take fag breaks but when I asked and got permission to get some change for a cuppa I got fired.’ Steven, who is married with a step-daughter and two young sons, has now got a job at a vacuum packing factory in Kidderminster. He said: ‘I’m now in this dead-end job at a vacuum-packing factory. ‘When I applied for jobs after the sacking I was asked why I had left my old job and I had to tell them. After that no one would get back to me. I became really depressed and had to be medicated. I was worried about my family as I had no idea how I could support them. ‘I got permission from my manager, but he later claimed he hadn’t done that.’ Sacking: Steven Tyler received a payout after he was unfairly dismissed from his job at the Stourbridge branch . He added that some of his friends who worked with him in the bakery came to be witnesses at the tribunal. ‘Now I can get my life back on track, it was never about the money, it was always about getting what was right. ‘I have been asked by the company not to disclose the exact amount they paid me but it was close to £10,000.’ During the tribunal in Birmingham, Sainsbury’s said employees could only leave the premises during the night with official permission because of 'security and health and safety regulations'. Sainsbury's today admitted they were wrong to sack Steven Tyler after he left the store to collect some change for a coffee. A spokesman said: 'To ensure that everyone who works on the night shift is safe we ask our colleagues to seek permission before they leave the store. 'However, we accept that we applied the rules too vigorously on this occasion.'","Steven Tyler from Kidderminster had worked as a baker at the supermarket for 11 years .

A shipwrecked yacht containing £80million of cocaine and the decomposing body of a dead crew member has been found by divers in the Pacific. The unusual discovery of the French-named vessel called Jereve, which was laden with 204 one-kilo blocks of cocaine, was made about ten miles north of Tonga's main island. A second crew member from the 40ft yacht, which had been tracked by authorities since it left Ecuador in August, is missing leaving police in four countries trying to establish if he is dead or on the run. Unusual discovery: A shipwrecked yacht called Jereve containing . £80million of cocaine and the decomposing body of a dead crew member has . been found by divers in the Pacific . Above, some of the 204 one-kilo blocks of cocaine found on board . The boat, which ran . aground on a reef, was discovered . by a group of divers who were exploring the area. Police in Tonga said the body had been taken to Nuku'alofa, the capital of the island of Tongatapu, where it is hoped the cause of death can be established. And police in Australia, Tonga, the Cook Island and the United States Drugs Enforcement Agency said yesterday that the drug-smuggling voyage had been organised by a crime syndicate with Australia believed to be the destination. The neatly-packaged drugs were found hidden in the hull of the yacht, which is known to have a history of sailing in waters off central America and Colombia in South America. The luxurious ship has three staterooms and space to sleep six people. The translation of its French name is 'I dream'. Expensive cargo: The neatly-packaged drugs were found hidden in the hull of the yacht, which is known to have a history of sailing in waters off central America and Colombia in South America . David Sharpe, Acting Assistant Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, said he was certain the drugs were bound for Australia . The wreck has left police trying to . solve several questions including whether the man who was discovered on . board had died before the yacht hit the reef. Former New Zealand police officer Mr . Grant O'Fee, who is now the Police Commissioner in Tonga, confirmed that . the body was that of a 'palagni' – the Tongan name for a white person . and not a Pacific islander or a Latin American. 'We have not yet been able to establish his name and we have yet to ascertain the cause of death,' said Mr O'Fee. But he confirmed that two men had been on board the vessel when it left Ecuador and it had been monitored by drug enforcement agencies. The yacht had been under watch for nearly two months as it sailed across the Pacific, but then the agencies monitoring it lost contact on October 5. Australian Federal Police (AFP) have sent forensic pathologists to Tonga to help with the investigation into the identity of the man. Mr David Sharpe, Acting Assistant Commissioner of the AFP, said he was certain the drugs were bound for Australia. Referring to the surveillance that had been place on the vessel earlier and the activity now surrounding it, he said it showed the value of collaboration between numerous countries spanning the Asia-Pacific region. 'This is an outstanding example of the effectiveness and strength of the relationships with our partners in the South Pacific and in the US to combat transnational crime in the region' said Mr Sharpe. He said this was the fourth drug vessel since 2010 targeting Australia 'so that's a total of 1.1 tons of cocaine on four yachts that have been stopped from reaching the shores of Australia,' he said. Mr O'Fee said forensic scientists would probably be analysing the corpse over the weekend. 'Identification of the body is not going to be an easy task, as you can imagine, ' he told Radio New Zealand.","Vessel had been tracked by drug enforcement authorities after it left Ecuador, but they lost contact on October 5 .

'Bully': The late ex-Rochdale MP Sir Cyril Smith is the latest high profile figure to be implicated in alleged sexual abuse . A political cover-up may have prevented Sir Cyril Smith being prosecuted for child sex abuse, an MP said yesterday. Sir Cyril, a high-profile Liberal MP, is accused of inflicting punishments on teenage boys at a hostel in the 1960s and 70s. His victims said he would spank them and order them to strip for ‘medical examinations’. The claims were investigated by police . but no case brought against the MP, who represented Rochdale for 20 . years and died two years ago at 82. Yesterday Simon Danczuk, Labour MP for . Rochdale,  called on Home Secretary Theresa May to investigate whether . there was a top level cover-up, possibly involving MI5. Now a former Thames Valley Police detective constable has said a special branch officer tried to prevent him and colleagues interviewing a man who alleged Smith abused young boys. Paul Foulston, 65, said he was intercepted by two special branch officers as he was about to interview a suspect as part of a murder inquiry in 1976. They told him they were 'working on an inquiry relating to an MP' and ordered him not to interview the 20-year-old man, Mr Foulston told the Guardian. The detective and his colleague ignored the request, and the suspect - who was eliminated from the murder inquiry - later told them he was angry because he had a relationship with Smith and that the politician had rejected him. Mr Foulston, who said he told them in detail how Smith preferred sex with young men, believes the 20-year-old must have told prison authorities and that they informed special branch. 'There were plenty of people in authority who knew what was going on,' he told the newspaper. Scandal: A plaque erected in Smith's honour in Rochdale has been removed in the wake of the allegations due to fears over vandalism . 'Cyril Smith was knighted and the system must have known he was unworthy.' The . former Liberal MP, who represented Rochdale in Parliament for 20 years, . this week became the latest in a string of public figures alleged to be . implicated in child sex abuse. The . House of Commons was told the '29 stone bully' had inflicted . humiliating punishments on boys at a hostel in the 1960s, ordering them . to strip then slapping their naked bottoms. A former special branch officer has also alleged that a Lancashire police file containing statements from young boys alleging abuse was seized by MI5 in the 1970s. Public figure: Smith represented Rochdale in Parliament for 20 years . Tony Robinson told the Telegraph he was contacted by an MI5 officer who informed him the file needed to be sent to London. He also claimed the contents were reviewed by the then Director of Public Prosecutions and deemed to be 'not in the public interest'. 'The police now say the file is lost. It seems like there was a complete cover-up to me,' Mr Robinson told the newspaper. The Crown Prosecution Service said yesterday it had re-opened its files on Smith. The latest scandal emerged after current Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk used a Commons debate to publicly accuse Smith of summoning boys from the town's Cambridge House Hostel and slap their naked bottoms. ‘Young boys were humiliated, terrified and reduced to quivering wrecks by a 29st bully imposing himself on them,’ Mr Danczuk said in Parliament. The MP, whose office was approached by six alleged victims, said he had seen statements given to Lancashire Police in the late 1960s, which made for ‘grim reading’. No case was ever brought against Smith. Barry Fitton, one of three alleged victims who lived at Cambridge House, said he was subjected to intrusive 'medical examinations' as a 15-year-old and forced to strip by Smith, who he claimed would slap him. Another, Eddie Shorrock, then 17, also claimed Smith subjected him to so-called medical examinations, as well as ordering to drop his trousers and 'twirl round'. The politician's appearance on one of Jimmy Savile's BBC TV shows during the 1970s may now form part of a review of claims of abuse on the corporation's premises. Mr Danczuk called for a new police investigation, and claimed the allegations pointed to a 'culture of cover-up' that 'extends right to the heart of our political establishment'.","Former Rochdale MP has been accused of abusing vulnerable young boys at a hostel for working boys in the town in the 1960s .

Just four years ago Jeanette Stewart was suffering from depression and working seven days a week in a desperate bid to pay off a crippling credit card debt of £60,000. After paying off her bills each month she had just £30 to live on, but her fortunes changed after she gave up her job as an N-Power complaints manager and started selling beauty products for Avon full-time and now the business woman from County Durham has an annual turnover of £1million as an Avon lady. Jeanette Stewart has turned her life around as an Avon lady and now manages a team of 900 sales people . She has been able to buy herself a E46 BMW convertible, has had the wedding of her dreams and paid off all her debts - which amounted to £60,000. The 33-year-old of Stanley, County Durham, said: “I was earning £24,000 a year at N-Power but all the money just went. 'I used it to pay off credit card debts and loans and was left with just £30 a month, which I spent on food. 'My house was under threat and I badly wanted to save it, meaning I worked all the over-time possible. 'I was suffering from depression and my mum had died of cancer. 'My life had hit rock bottom, I was even in the situation where I had started using credit cards to pay off debts. 'I was working seven days a week for N-Power, and I had no life. 'To make matters worse I was also in a bad relationship and a bad place.' Jeanette once lived on just £30 a month after amassing credit card debts amounting to £60,000 . Today she is a successful sales executive at the company where a convertible car is just one of the perks . But Jeanette has now completely turned her life around. She married Kevin, 29, at Lumley Castle in County Durham last year, spending a whopping £30,000 on the wedding. The Avon lady travelled to the venue in a horse and carriage, had a total of nine bridesmaids and a casino at the reception. She also enjoyed a champagne reception, a fire breathing show, a fireworks display, stilt-walkers and a seven tier castle cake built on a water fountain. It was a wedding she could only have dreamt of while living on less than £10 a week. In 2008 friends had suggested that Jeanette, whose mum had loved Avon products, give the company a ring. She applied for a job as a part-time sales leader and began by selling to friends and family. She added: “It was a huge step for me and my confidence was low. 'But I found I was good at selling the products. I started talking to more people, and began to feel better about my self. 'I got one order of £800 and that felt amazing.' Glamorous celebrities including Reese Witherspoon and Alesha Dixon have helped raise the profile of the traditional cosmetics brand . Jeanette, of Stanley, County Durham, is now a senior sales executive and manages a staff of 900. She said: 'I am so much happier now. 'I no longer suffering from depression. I am now a completely different person, plus I have managed to pay off all my debts. 'We had a massive, huge wedding, it was amazing. I had a lovely dress, it was like a fairytale.' Three months after joining Avon Jeanette became a team leader then eventually a senior sales executive. She added: 'Within a 12-week Avon campaign I had turned over £22,000. It changed my life. 'Avon gave me a car and I went to Berlin and Dublin on trips through Avon. 'One Christmas I took out £9,000 and just paid some cards off. 'In a normal job you would have had to save up for years to do that. To earn that amount of money and to do that in a job I love is amazing.' In 2011 Jeanette earned a total salary of £63,000 through Avon, while by the end of this year she expects to have received between £80,000 and £90,000. She says she expects her wage to carry on increasing at this rate year by year. After witnessing her success Kevin joined Avon to work alongside Jeanette when he lost his job. Jeanette added: 'Avon has changed my life for the better. 'My mum Jessie would have been ecstatic at my success. 'I spoke to her best friend the other day and she nearly had me in floods of tears telling me how she would have been so proud.'","Was working 7 days a week to pay off £60,000 credit card debt .

The man accused of killing a mother and her 14-year-old daughter carried out the gruesome crime to kidnap the woman's two youngest daughters, with whom he is now on the run, his wife has claimed. A massive manhunt is underway for Adam Mayes, 35, who allegedly abducted Alexandria Bain, 12, and Kyliyah Bain, eight, last week. He has been charged with the murders of their mother and sister. His wife, Teresa Mayes, who lived with Mayes and his parents in their trailer in Guntown, Mississippi, has also been charged with two counts of first-degree murder - as she lifted the lid on their motive. 'Family friend': Adam Mayes with Adrienne Bain, who he is alleged to have killed along with her mother, and her sister Alexandria. Mayes's wife has now said Adam's motive was to kidnap the two youngest Bain girls . She told police she was present on April 27 when her husband killed Jo Ann Bain and her daughter Adrienne in a garage at their Whiteville, Tennessee, home, according to an affidavit. She added that the motive was to kidnap Bain's two younger daughters. It comes a day after Teresa Mayes was charged with especially aggravated kidnapping after she admitted she drove her husband, the girls and the two bodies from southwest Tennessee. When back home in Guntown, she saw Adam Mayes dig a hole in the yard, she told police. The bodies of Jo Ann and Alexandria Bain were found buried at the property a week later. Adam Mayes's mother, Mary Mayes, 65, was also charged with four counts of conspiracy . to commit especially aggravated kidnapping on Tuesday. She told police she heard digging outside her home - believed to be when her son was digging the graves - but did not alert authorities. Both women have been jailed in Tennessee. Sighting: Adam Mayes is believed to be with two daughters of murdered Jo Ann Bain. He was spotted in a Guntown, Mississippi convenience store three days after they went missing . Insight: Teresa Mayes (left) said she saw her husband kill Jo Ann Bain and her daughter in Tennessee. His mother Mary Mayes, 65, (right) has been charged with four counts of conspiracy to commit kidnapping . On Wednesday, it also emerged that . Adam Mayes was spotted in a convenience store in Union County, . Mississippi on July 30 - about three days after the family went missing. In grainy footage released by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, Mayes can be seen in the County Line One Market on . Highway 348 in Guntown with shorter hair. Owner Nick Barghouthi said he commented on Mayes' shorter hair and the suspect acknowledged it. The TBI have said he may have also . altered the appearance of the two missing girls, Alexandra Bain, 12, and . Kyliyah Bain, eight, by cutting or dying their hair. Also on Wednesday, Mayes's sister-in-law Bobbi Booth pleaded with the fugitive via CNN to 'do the right thing and just let the children go'. The bodies of Jo Ann and Adrienne Bain were found buried at the Guntown property and identified by authorities. The FBI has not said how the woman and her daughter died. Tragic: The bodies of Jo Ann Bain, left, and her 14-year-old daughter, Adrienne Bain, right, were found behind the Mississippi home of their alleged kidnapper Adam Mayes, a family friend . Taken: Eight-year-old Kyliyah, left, and her sister Alexandria, . 12, right, are still believed to be with Mayes . FBI spokesman Joel Siskovic told The . Associated Press on Tuesday: 'We're still working on the belief that the . youngest two daughters are . alive. We're still hopeful.' Also speaking to AP, Teresa . Mayes' sister, Bobbi Booth, said her sister told her last week that she . knew about the killings, but Booth thinks she was too scared to call . the police. Booth told . her sister to call the police and was assured that she had, but by . Saturday Booth had become suspicious about that claim and called police . herself. 'I told them . exactly what she had told me: Who the bodies were, where they could be . dug from,' Booth said - although investigators had begun digging the . garden the previous day. Investigation: FBI agents search the backyard of Adam Mayes's Mississippi home, where he lived with his parents . Search: The FBI gathers officers for a briefing. The bodies of Jo Ann and Adrienne Bain were found at the home . Fears: The FBI, which searched the area surrounding the trailer, thinks Mayes has changed his appearance . She said that Teresa Mayes had expressed fears that her husband was having an affair with Jo Ann. But Booth added that she finds it . hard to believe Adam Mayes could kill a child, especially as he seemed . 'like a big happy family' with the Bains parents and their children. 'I have cried until I'm sick,' she . said. 'I was totally shocked. I've known him since I was little. We . played together when we were kids. I always thought he was odd, but I . never dreamed he'd do this.' Booth said she has not had much contact with her sister for the past 11 years as Adam Mayes stood in the way. 'He was very aggressive with her, abusive,' she said. FBI agents wearing green camouflage and carrying high-powered rifles swarmed the woods and back roads of north Mississippi near Mayes' home, joined by K-9 units and SWAT teams. Troopers stopped vehicles and looked . in trunks on Monday, while FBI agents continued to search the garden of . the house where Adam Mayes lived with his wife and his parents. Hope: Hundreds gather during a vigil for the missing sisters, Alexandria and Kyliyah, in Bolivar, Tennessee . Together: The community prayed for their safe return between games at the Dixie Youth Fields . Bain's husband reported the four missing from their rural Tennessee home April 27. Mayes, a longtime friend of Bain's . husband, had stayed over at the family's house to help them pack and . load up a U-Haul to drive across the country to Arizona, authorities . said. Gary Bain, who was at the house that night, awoke to find his wife, daughters and Mayes gone. He couldn't reach his wife on her cell phone that day, and reported them missing when the girls didn't get off the school bus. Mayes was last seen a week ago in Guntown, about 80 miles south of the Bain family's home. Both Gary Bain and Mayes were once married to sisters, Tennessee Bureau of Investigation spokeswoman Kristin Helm said. Jo Ann Bain's aunt said she was waiting for authorities to tell her that her niece and the girls are safe. Victims: The Hardeman County Sheriff's Department said Jo Ann Bain, far right, and daughters Adrienne, 14; Alexandria, 12; and Kyliyah, 8; had been missing since April 27 . Family: Adam Mayes's wife told police she drove the mother and her three daughters, pictured, to Mississippi . 'I pray for Jo Ann and the girls to be OK and for them to come home,' said Beverly Goodman, who works at Whiteville City Hall. She said that her niece was not the type of woman to run off with someone. Linda Kirkland, a family friend and . cook at the Country Cafe in Whiteville, said the woman and her daughters . were moving to Arizona because two of the girls had asthma. 'Jo Ann and the kids, everyone loves them. We're just hoping to hear that they're safe,' she said. Siskovic, the FBI spokesman, said . authorities talked to Mayes early on in the investigation, but he fled . when they tried to contact him again. Mayes also has ties to Arizona, Texas, . North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida. He may be using the aliases . of Christopher Zachery Wylde or Paco Rodrigass. Investigation: Police believe family friend Christopher Mayes abducted them and may have forced the family to cut and dye their hair to conceal their identities . Warrant: As the search continues a warrant for Mayes has been issued after he provided a false report to investigators before disappearing himself . While authorities say Mayes is likely . to be armed and extremely dangerous, acquaintances describe him as . friendly, helpful and like an uncle to the girls. Gerald Long, 60, of Jackson, . Tennessee, said he last saw Mayes about two years ago. He said Mayes . lived across the street from him for about a year with his wife, Teresa. He described Mayes as a 'sociable person.'

Mother-of-three Christina Staggs, 26, tipped the scales at 22 stone after gorging on sweets, chocolate bars and ice cream following the birth of her second son. But she decided to go on a diet after a stranger told her she bore an uncanny resemblance to Hollywood beauty Angelina Jolie and she became desperate to emulate her idol. She joined Slimming World in April 2010 and by August this year she had shed a staggering 11 stone and went from a size 24 to a trim size eight. Christina Staggs weighed in at 21 stone in 2007 and has shed 11 stone in just 16 months because she wanted to look like her idol Angelina Jolie . She used to gorge on sugary sweets but now she has adopted a much healthier lifestyle after a stranger told her she looked like Angelina Jolie . Christina, who has three sons Dimitris, eight, Andreas, six and two-year-old Theo, now weighs 10 stone 9lbs and is regularly stopped in the street by people who mistake her for Brad Pitt's stunning wife. The young woman from Gosberton, Lincs., said: 'I must admit I never really saw the resemblance myself when I was bigger but one day I was chatting to a woman who said I looked like Angelina Jolie. 'She said we had the same lips which was quite a compliment because Angelina is famous for her big sexy pout. 'I thought I looked more Angelina Jelly than Jolie but the comment stuck with me and I had always tried, and failed, to lose weight but I suddenly thought I had a goal to aim for. 'I've always had a really sweet tooth and love sugary snacks. What a difference a year makes!

I'd eat loads. 'Now I've lost all the weight people say I am the spitting image of Angelina which I'm quite chuffed about and my boyfriend doesn't complain either.' Christina was also motivated to lose weight after she failed to buy any clothes which fit her. She said: 'Every time I went shopping for clothes I struggled to buy anything that fit me and sometimes I had to order bigger sizes. 'When I bought a size 23 I thought I didn't want to do that anymore. The mother-of-three has received numerous compliments now about her similar looks to her Hollywood icon . 'And I used to get chest pains so I thought something had to be done. 'I lost six pounds in my first week and 19 pounds in a month so the excitement of that spurred me to keep going. 'It's about teaching yourself to control the impulse and the snacking. At Slimming World you can have anything you want but in moderation.'

A nine-year-old girl suffering from an extremely rare liver condition which turns her skin and eyes yellow has to spend up to 12 hours every day under bright blue ultraviolet lights to stay healthy. Brianna Minnich, of Whitehall, Pennsylvania, spends each night tucked up in bed beneath the lights she needs to help battle the serious disease, which can sometimes lead to brain damage. Her skin and eyes turn yellow whenever she has a sudden change in mood caused by illness, injury, stress, being bullied at school or even arguing with her six-year-old brother. Condition: Brianna Minnich, of Whitehall, Pennsylvania, spends each night tucked up in bed beneath the lights she needs to help battle Crigler-Najjar syndrome, which can sometimes lead to brain damage . Brianna suffers from Crigler-Najjar syndrome, meaning she has dangerously high levels of bilirubin, a naturally occurring waste product from the blood usually broken down by an enzyme in the liver. She has to sleep under a 4ft bank of phototherapy lights over her bed - but as she gets older it is likely she will need a liver transplant, which can cause complications. The UV rays from the blue light affect the bilirubin in her system when they come into contact with her red blood cells and skin tissue. By helping to manage bilirubin levels in her body and keep them at an acceptable level, Brianna is saved from any long term damage. Her father Bob Minnich, 29, said: ‘Her bilirubin levels were considerably high, right up in the high twenties for the first month or so after being born. Family: Brianna (front), lives with her father Bob, 29, (right) mother Brooke, 28, (left) and brother Brenden, six (centre) in Whitehall, Pennsylvania - near Pittsburgh . ‘We were told soon after the diagnosis . that she was only the 52nd person in the country (the US) to have the . disorder and just the 212th in the world. 'We were told after the diagnosis that she was only the 52nd person in the country (the US) to have the disorder and just the 212th in the world' Bob Minnich, father . ‘In the past three or four years her body has maintained a much more steady level of around 10-15 - the average person has a level of around 0.5 so it's still very high. ‘She was started on Phenobarbital immediately, and used what was called a “bili blanket”, which is a small phototherapy blanket until she grew out of it. ‘Whenever she is unwell and believe it or not whenever she has a sudden change in her mood such as getting upset at her brother or if she gets bullied then her skin tone changes drastically to a much more visible “yellow” until she calms herself back down. ‘She also sleeps under a 4ft long bank of phototherapy lights every single night, for at least nine hours a night which typically keeps her skin tone fairly 'normal'. Brave girl: Brianna suffers from Crigler-Najjar syndrome, meaning she has dangerously high levels of bilirubin, a naturally occurring waste product from the blood usually broken down by an enzyme in the liver . ‘The only thing you can really see is her yellow eyes. People ask us all the time: “Why are your daughter's eyes yellow”?’ 'The only thing you can really see is her yellow eyes. People ask us all the time: ""Why are your daughter's eyes yellow""?' Mr Minnich . After being born Brianna underwent tests and was constantly in and out of the hospital for two weeks before finally being transferred to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania. She was eventually diagnosed with . Crigler-Najjar syndrome at two-and-a-half weeks old and spent the best . part of a month in hospital before being released. Phototherapy has helped bubbly Brianna, but the treatment becomes less successful as she grows up - so her dosage of phenobarbital must increase. Daily medication helps jump start her liver but whenever the dosage is increased she feels lethargic for weeks and constantly falls asleep at home and school - as well as feeling depressed. Helping hand: The UV rays from the blue light affect the bilirubin in her system when they come into contact with her red blood cells and skin tissue . Mr Minnich added: ‘It's difficult for her social life - having sleepovers at home is hard due to her lights and we have not allowed her stay at her friend’s house due to not having the lights. 'It's difficult for her social life - having sleepovers at home is hard due to her lights and we have not allowed her stay at her friend’s house due to not having the lights' Mr Minnich . ‘During the winter months it's even harder since we don’t have the bright sun to use to our advantage as the UV rays also act as a natural phototherapy light. ‘Long term effects of the lights include having gallstones, so normally a Crigler-Najjar patient eventually has their gallbladder taken out. ‘The lights are also very bright and will . likely affect her eyes. The medication she takes is a barbiturate so . taking it for the rest of her life is also going to cause problems. ‘Her disorder will never go away, with the exception of getting a liver transplant. There have been talks of an experimental process called gene therapy, but it has been in the testing phase for years due to the lack of funds for research. Hopes: She hasn't let her illness stop her from aiming high - and hopes to become a famous TV star one day . ‘While we were in the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia after she was born, my wife and I were both tested for compatibility, and it was determined that I would be a good donor. 'Brianna loves to sing, play guitar and draw and has also been in multiple plays and dance performances for school - she is the typical ""artsy"" type of young girl' Mr Minnich . ‘The process would take a portion of my liver and have it implanted into her body, which will than grow into her. ‘The problem with the transplant is that she will still be taking anti-rejection pills the rest of her life and there are many risks in the transplant. ‘We know families who have had the transplant, and in return, have had many problems and complications afterwards. We have been told that we would need to make a decision on the transplant by her pre-teens.’ Brianna, who also lives with her mother Brooke, 28, and brother Brenden, six, hasn't let her illness stop her from aiming high - and she one day hopes to become a famous TV star. Still smiling: After being born Brianna underwent tests and was constantly in and out of the hospital for two weeks before finally being transferred to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania . Mr Minnich said: ‘Brianna loves to sing, play guitar and draw and has also been in multiple plays and dance performances for school - she is the typical ""artsy"" type of young girl. ‘On top of her creative mind she also likes playing softball and riding bikes. She asked us if we could put her in a six-week modelling and acting class that she saw on television. ‘Since the day she graduated she talks everyday about becoming famous and one day having her picture in a magazine or being on a hit Disney show. ‘Although we haven't yet heard anything from the agent's office I tell her each day to never give up faith that maybe one day she'll get her big break.’","Brianna Minnich, nine, of Pennsylvania, suffers from Crigler-Najjar syndrome .

A Holiday Inn in China is being used as a 'black jail' for people who dare to complain about life under the Communist regime, it has been claimed. A group of alleged victims say they were snatched on their way to Beijing to air their grievances over being forcibly removed from their homes to make way for an expansion of Shanghai's Pudong International Airport in 2005. Their plan was to hand in a petition to the10-day annual meeting of China's legislature in March, CNN reported. Black Jail? Xie Jinghua was among five people stopped by plain-clothes police officers and hauled back to the Holiday Inn Express in Nanhuizui - located in Lingang New City on the outskirts of Shanghai . But during the 665-mile journey from their home to the Chinese capital, they were stopped by plain-clothes police and hauled back to the Holiday Inn Express in Nanhuizui - located in Lingang New City on the outskirts of Shanghai. There they say they were held for eight days until the conference was over, locked in a room under 24-hour guard and tied to the bed if they tried to escape. Xie Jinghua said all she and her husband wanted was to complain about the compensation they received after their farmhouse was demolished leaving them homeless. Instead they were locked in separate rooms where they were told they would be given 'classes about petitioner regulations'. Security: Soldiers guard the Great Hall of the People, home to the annual National People's Congress, which the petitioners claim they were prevented from attending . But Xie says she received no such classes. She was kept in a third-storey room under the watchful eye of two female officers. She became so desperate and frightened that, at one point, she tried to escape over the balcony, only to be met by seven more officers who escorted her back to the room. 'I really felt quite sick inside,' told CNN. '[They] put me on the bed and used the bedspread to hold me down.' The couple, who now live in a tiny . apartment near the airport where her son works as a janitor, were among . five people who claimed to have been held against their will at the . Holiday Inn. When contacted . by CNN, The InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) - the UK-based firm . that owns the Holiday Inn Express brand - said there was no indication . any of their rooms had been used to incarcerate recalcitrant citizens. A . spokeswoman did however say a group of rooms were booked by a . government official from the Pudong district of Shanghai on the days in . question. Expansion: A group of alleged victims say they were snatched on their way to Beijing to air their grievances over being forcibly removed from their homes to make way for an expansion of Shanghai's Pudong International Airport in 2005 (pictured) But when asked to disclose any CCTV footage of the period, IHG refused saying all tapes were erased after a month. An . IHG statement read: 'We have found no evidence which would confirm . these accusations or any sign that the hotel owner knew or cooperated . with (the) government on this hotel stay and the hotel is operated in . accordance with PRC [People's Republic of China] local laws and . regulations.' They added . that a 'full investigation' had taken place and that details of any . guests could not be revealed because of privacy laws. Up to 10,000 people a year are hauled off the streets, locked up and beaten . in the makeshift prisons in abandoned factories or converted apartment . blocks, according to New . York-based Human Rights Watch. They are snatched on their way to hand in petitions listing their grievances to the authorities in Beijing and other big cities. And . the kidnappers are paid by local officials who get black marks against . their names if too many citizens from their area lodge complaints. Petitioners . are held for days or months in the detention centres, deprived of food . and sleep, beaten and threatened, say campaigners. Human Rights Watch blames a civil service points system . that penalises officials if too many people from their area complain to . the central government and rewards those who minimise grievances. Because bonuses and promotions depend . on how many points they have, it is economical for officials to pay . kidnappers to intercept, detain and intimidate petitioners, it said. CNN reporters did approach the hotel directly and were told by a front desk worker that there were a number of guests who were staying in their rooms and were not leaving, and there were people standing outside their room, but that they had no idea why. ING said they had interviews all staff at the hotel and none had stood up the claims. Dissenters being held against their will in China is nothing new. But activists say this is the first time a facility run by a foreign body has been allegedly used for unlawful detentions. Phelim Kine, a senior Asia researcher with the New York-based Human Rights Watch told CNN: . 'From our research and research from domestic Chinese human rights [groups], people are held from a few days to several months and routinely subjected to physical abuse, sleep deprivation and very often they have to buy their way out of custody. 'The government has denied there are any such black jail facilities in China. Even though [Chinese] state media run stories about black jails, there is an official disconnect.'

China's petitions offices were developed as a safety valve to ease social discontent by giving citizens a channel to complain and giving officials a window into their worries. But an alleged internal government directive from southern China revealed officials get two points if they bring petitioners back from Beijing or the provincial capital of Changsha, while those who fail to do so have a half-point deducted. Officials typically pay black jails between £13 and £26 a day to hold complainants until they can be picked up and returned home. Police are aware of the prisons but ignore them because they keep potentially  troublesome petitioners away from cities, the report said.","Xie Jinghua and her husband were among five people who claim they were held against their will at the Holiday Inn Express in Nanhuizui, near Shanghai .

Devastated: Parents Emma and Terry Charlton fought a two-year battle with a hospital when their baby was wrongly certified as being stillborn after fatal mistakes by staff . A mother fought a two-year battle with a hospital when her baby was wrongly certified as being stillborn after fatal  mistakes by staff. Ava Mae Charlton was born by emergency caesarean section but she struggled to breathe and died after only 32 minutes. Hospital officials tried to claim the baby was stillborn and so her death did not need to be investigated. But her parents Emma and Terry Charlton always maintained their daughter had been alive. They fought for an inquest until – after two years – the hospital finally admitted that Ava had not been stillborn, allowing the scrutiny of a hearing. Her death followed those of two other babies at Milton Keynes Hospital in similar circumstances, when the mothers had to wait for a caesarean to be carried out. Following the latest tragedy, coroner Tom Osborne has ordered managers to report all stillbirths and neonatal deaths to him for further investigation. Mrs Charlton, a teacher, 31, said:  ‘People questioned my sanity and it was infuriating because I knew my baby had been alive. I was grief-stricken and  vulnerable and you just accept what health professionals tell you. ‘But when they handed me that  stillborn certificate, I knew something wasn’t right. Then a meeting with our consultant opened up a whole can of worms and highlighted a number of errors that had been made.’ Ava’s death in September 2009 came when the maternity unit was still reeling from criticism into the death of another baby, Ebony McCall, four months before. Then, Mr Osborne had condemned staff shortages which contributed to her demise as ‘nothing short of scandalous’. The deaths of the two girls bear an uncanny resemblance. Both went into distress and both mothers had to wait a considerable time for caesareans. Ava, like Ebony, would very probably be alive today had the surgery been carried out sooner, the inquest heard. The loss of a third baby girl, Romy Feast in 2007 in similar circumstances, in the same unit also prompted criticism from the coroner at the time. Mr Osborne delivered a narrative verdict at Ava’s inquest at Milton Keynes Coroner’s Court. ‘There was a failure to recognise the seriousness of her (Ava’s) condition and a delay in carrying out the emergency caesarean section,’ he said. The coroner ruled that if the surgery had been carried out earlier ‘on the balance of probabilities Ava would have survived’. Mrs Charlton, of Milton Keynes, was admitted when 36 weeks’ pregnant, suffering with pre-eclampsia, the court heard. Tragic: Ava Mae Charlton's death followed those of two other babies at Milton Keynes Hospital in similar circumstances . She had previously had an MRI scan which showed she had a ‘borderline pelvis’ making a  natural delivery risky. But Mrs Charlton was not told of this risk and was not given the option of a caesarean section. Instead, she was induced and a short time later, began to bleed with Ava becoming distressed in the womb, the court was told. But doctors delayed the decision to carry out an emergency caesarean for one hour and 25 minutes. When it was finally performed, the baby was born in a ‘very poor condition’ and despite resuscitation, died shortly after. After last month’s inquest, Mrs Charlton and her husband, who works in graphics, will finally be able to register Ava’s birth. The couple, who later had another daughter, Isla, now two, said they were devastated by the hospital’s blunder. ‘It has taken us years to get to this stage and we feel quite bitter it took this long for the hospital to concede they had made a mistake,’ said Mrs Charlton. ‘They have destroyed my life and took my child away. It is utterly devastating and has totally changed me. ‘This is not the first case where the hospital has been forced to face questions about its practice of declaring babies “stillborn”, thereby avoiding an inquest. ‘It is particularly distressing that our baby would still be with us today had the caesarean taken place earlier. Hopefully the verdict will be acted upon so other parents will be spared the pain we have had to endure simply to discover the truth.’ As a direct result of Ava’s death, the coroner has ruled that all stillbirths and neonatal deaths in his area will have to reported so he can decide if an inquest should be called. Hospital medical director Martin Wetherill said maternity services had been significantly improved, ensuring such an incident should never occur again. He added: ‘Clinical staff made an error in classifying Ava as a stillbirth.’ The hospital has apologised for the ‘unimaginable distress’ caused by her death. Its maternity services were given a clean bill of health by inspectors in April 2011.","Ava Mae Charlton was born by emergency caesarean section but she struggled to breathe and died after only 32 minutes .

Lakeland, 21, who is based in Catterick, North Yorkshire, and Craig, 19, of Lower Bank Road in Fulwood, Preston, have both now pleaded guilty to actual bodily harm at Preston Crown Court, according to The Lancashire Evening Post. 'Seemed pleasant': Soldier Matthew Lakeland (above) and Ben Craig have pleaded guilty to last May's attack . As the pair await sentencing on February 20, Mr Rawstrone today relived the attack, which took place last May shortly after he had moved to the city from his home town of Kirkham.

The price of burgers, sausages and pies is to rocket because of an EU ban on low-quality meat. From the end of this month, there will be a ban on bulking up fast food and supermarket value ranges with reconstituted mince made from scraps of beef and lamb. The move will hit the shopping budget of already hard-pressed families and lead to more meat being wasted in abattoirs. Endangered: An EU ban on low-quality meat could spell the end for the cheap hamburger . The Food Standards Agency, which risked a ban on the export of British meat products if it did not impose the Brussels-driven ruling, stressed that the change is not being made because of health or safety issues. Instead, it is the result of a disagreement over the definition of the so-called ‘desinewed meat’. But the meat-processing industry accused the FSA of ‘bowing down’ to the European Commission and warned of price rises and job losses. Health drive: Jamie Oliver's campaign for junk food to be banned from school canteens means desinewed meat features less in school dinners . Stephen Rossides, director of the British Meat Processors Association, said: ‘This is a criminal waste of a valuable food product at a time when we are being urged to reduce food wastage. Common sense has gone out of the window. ‘If economic principles apply, the cost of the burger will rise and it is going to be the less well-off who are affected at what is already a bad time.’ The row surrounds desinewed meat, or DSM. This is meat that is left on bones and carcasses after slaughter. Rather than going to waste, it is grated off mechanically, creating a mince-like substance. Jamie Oliver’s high-profile campaign for junk food to be banned from school canteens means DSM features less in school dinners than in the past. But it is widely found in inexpensive meat products on sale in fast food restaurants and in supermarkets, where it is used to bulk up the meat content at low cost. The FSA sees DSM as being a different product to a second type of reconstituted meat, called mechanically separated meat, or MSM. The higher pressures used in the MSM process means that while it is considered acceptable for chicken and pork, it is not deemed usable for beef and lamb, for fear of spreading diseases such as BSE.However, the European Commission says DSM and MSM are one and the same. Under this interpretation of the law, it will no longer be possible to put beef or lamb through even the gentler DSM processing. Existing products will not be recalled but any foods that contain reconstituted beef or lamb will have to be reformulated. The cheap desinewed meat in burgers will have to be replaced with more expensive cuts. Chicken and pork carcasses can still undergo DSM processing but any foods they are put into will have to be clearly labelled. Currently, DSM’s classification as meat means it counts towards the total meat content of a product and does not need to be listed separately on the label. There are fears that the changes will push up the cost of some meat products so much that shoppers stop buying them, leading to job losses in Britain’s £6billion meat industry. The British Meat Processors Association estimates that the total cost to the consumer and industry of the moratorium could reach £200million. Describing the ban as ‘madness’, Mr Rossides said: ‘All this has happened at breakneck speed. The industry must be given time to adjust to any change in requirements and market circumstances in a controlled and properly managed way, in order to minimise market disruption and financial damage. ‘People are going to have to reformulate products, repackage and relabel. I don’t know that you won’t see an English sausage any more but it may be that it’s more expensive.’ The FSA said that if the dispute over classification can be resolved, the ban could be lifted. Its chief executive, Tim Smith, said the move had come ‘unexpectedly’. The Food and Drink Federation said it supports ‘a pragmatic approach to the required changes, including a reasonable timeframe for the transition, to avoid disproportionate measures that could lead to meat being wasted, causing a significant impact on the environment and on the price and availability of meat raw material’. A spokesman for the consumer watchdog Which? said that its research showed that shoppers want to know if they are eating desinewed meat and that clear labelling of food allows customers to make an informed choice.","Ban on bulking up fast food with reconstituted mince to be introduced at the end of the month .

Lucky escape: Leanne Helm rescued her daughter Jessica Cannon only moments before her Skoda went up in flames . A frightened couple have revealed how they fought desperately to free their eight-month-old baby daughter from a burning car. Leanne Helm, 21, and Callum Cannon, 23, managed to pull Jessica Cannon out of their Skoda Fabia only moments before it was engulfed in flames. The doors of the car had become jammed and they were only able to rescue the girl by reaching through the window. The couple were driving home from seeing the Olympic torch relay in Knutsford, Cheshire, when smoke began to plume from the passenger air vent. Miss Helm stopped the car in Northwich Road, near the Knutsford stately home Tabley House, but the couple then saw sparks coming from the glove box and they could not unlock the doors. Mr Cannon was eventually able to get his door open, but Miss Helm was trapped inside with their daughter. Miss Helm said: 'I went to grab my door handle to get out and it wouldn’t open. 'I kept pulling and pulling and I don’t know how but it eventually opened.' On getting out of the car, Miss Helm started trying to smash open a window but she couldn't break through. With the dashboard already on fire, the couple then tried a different approach and leaned through the front doors to unwind a window before pulling Jessica through it from her car seat. Charred: The car was burnt out within 10 minutes after smoke came pluming through a vent . Mystery: Skoda said they would investigate why the car caught fire . The car was completely burned out within 10 minutes. The fire, believed to have been caused by an electrical fault, happened at 11.40am on May 31. Firefighters put out the blaze and Cheshire Police towed what remained of the vehicle to one of its garages later that day. Miss Helm said: 'We were lucky to get out when we did because it went straight up after that.' Miss Helm's mother Jo, 39, and brother Jack, 10, also watched the torchbearing ceremony and received a hysterical phone call on their way home.

The Georgia woman battling an aggressive flesh-eating bacteria has been pictured for the first time since the disease claimed her four limbs - grinning outside the hospital alongside her smiling parents. Aimee Copeland, 24, developed necrotizing fasciitis after cutting her leg in a fall from a homemade zip line over a west Georgia river on May 1. As the relentless disease ravaged her body, her left leg, right foot and both hands were amputated, and doctors were also forced to remove part of her torso. Now, a day after doctors upgraded her condition from serious to good, Aimee has ventured outside for the first time - 49 days after she was first admitted to hospital. Scroll down for video . Smiles all around: Aimee Copeland has been pictured for the first time since she lost her limbs to flesh-eating bacteria. The image shows her grinning outside the hospital with her parents . 'The look on Aimee's face was just . incredible,' her father, Andy Copeland, told Good Morning America. 'She could smell the pine trees and feel the . breeze through her hair and just the sun on her skin. That was a . remarkable change for her just to see how she glowed when we took her . outside.' While there, they took a photograph of Aimee grinning with her hair pulled into a side pony tail, with her parents smiling either side of her. Bandages cover the ends of her arms. 'Aimee has a beauty in this photograph that I think goes beyond words,' Andy Copeland said. 'It's a beauty of survival, of resilience.' Proud: Her father, Andy Copeland, holds up the photo during an interview with Good Morning America . Copeland, who has been keeping a blog about his daughter's condition, posted online to describe the moment the sun fell on her skin again for the first time in nearly two months. He wrote that, once the family was outside, they reflected on the life-changing events - and Aimee showed breathtaking courage. 'I don’t have any regrets about what has happened,' Aimee told her father. 'I don’t focus on what I’ve lost, I would rather focus on what I’ve gained. I feel like I’ve been blessed.' She went on: 'I am blessed to have the opportunity to experience something that not many other people have the chance to experience. Upbeat: On a blog, Aimee's father has said he is amazed by her courage and determination to walk . Resolve: Aimee (right, pictured with her sister) said she felt blessed to have an experience others never get . 'I am blessed to have the capacity to . share my experience with others and have a chance to improve the quality . of someone else's life. I’m blessed to be different.' Speaking to GMA, her father spoke of her determination to walk at her Master's graduation ceremony this December. 'You heard the word right,' he said. 'Walk. That's what she intends to do.' Earlier this month, Mr Copeland said his daughter had been enduring the worst pain of the ordeal. Her agony was so overwhelming that she began taking morphine after initially refusing medication. The . student had originally indicated that she felt a 'traitor to her . convictions' by using drugs to manage her pain, because she believed in . holistic medicine. Injuries: Aimee had her left leg, right foot and both hands amputated. She also lost part of her torso . Much-loved: Aimee's friends and family are praying for her survival and eventual recovery (from left - Aimee, mother Donna, father Andy and sister Paige) She also suffered phantom pains. Mr Copeland wrote: 'Although she has no hands, her brain . is apparently still telling her body that the hands are there. 'I asked . her if she could describe the pain and she told me, ""It feels like I . have been carrying bags of rocks"".' The . University of West Georgia student had to have her left leg amputated . at the hip, her right foot and both hands in order to save her life . after a cut to her leg became infected. The bacteria that attacked Miss . Copeland's wound released a toxin that destroys skin, muscle and a layer . of tissue below the skin known as fascia, her father said. Distraught: Paige Copeland, centre, cried as her parents Donna and Andy spoke about Aimee after she had her leg amputated . Miss Copeland has . improved incredibly rapidly with the support of her family and . well-wishers who have made donations on the website Mr Copeland set up . for his brave daughter. Mr . Copeland wrote that support for his daughter has come from all over the . country, including celebrities like Sophia Vergara, Katie Couric and . Ann Curry. Less than a month ago, doctors gave her . little chance of survival, but she became increasingly alert, despite . several major operations, but she is likely to remain hospitalised for several more months. 'This . doctor can't fathom a reason for why she's improved the way she has,' Mr Copeland said. 'Her spirits are extraordinarily high. I am absolutely . amazed.' Necrotizing . fasciitis, more commonly known as 'flesh-eating disease', is a rare but . extremely vicious bacterial infection. 'Necrotizing' refers to . something that causes body tissue to die, and the infection can destroy . skin, muscles and fat. The . disease develops when the bacteria enters the body, often through a . minor cut or scrape. As the bacteria multiply, they release toxins that . kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area.

Symptoms . include small, red lumps or bumps on the skin, rapidly-spreading . bruising, sweating, chills, fever and nausea. Organ failure and shock . are also common complications. Sufferers . must be treated immediately to prevent death, and are usually given . powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue.

George Zimmerman has been accused of molesting a young girl for a decade when they were children, according to prosecution records released today. A young woman, identified only as witness 9, told prosecutors that Zimmerman, who is two years older than her, began abusing her when she was six and stopped when she was 16. 'He would put his hands under my pants, under my underwear,' the witness says, according to the Orlando Sentinel. Accused: George Zimmerman, who is accused of murdering teen Trayvon Martin, molested a young girl for a decade, the prosecution has said as part of a new set of newly-released evidence . The claim is part of a new set of evidence released by Special Prosecutor Angela Corey. She released witness 9's statement in addition to 120 recorded jail phone calls made by Zimmerman when he was in the Seminole County Jail after being charged over the murder of Trayvon Martin. The witness contacted authorities in Sanford, Florida after the February 26 killing and subsequent news coverage. She told prosecutors the sexual abuse began when her parents . were moving to another state and she and her sister stayed . with Zimmerman and his family in Virginia. She said the abuse occurred as they watched TV and he reached under the blankets to touch her. 'I would try to push him off, but he was . bigger and stronger and older,' she said. Free: Zimmerman is pictured leaving prison earlier this month after posting $1 million bail . On at least one occasion, when she was 12, he also forced her to touch him, she said. In a recorded statement, a woman identified only as Witness 9 said: . 'It started when I was six. He almost two years older than I am and my parents were moving... and they sent us up to [Zimmerman's home]. 'We would watch movies in front of the TV and we would have pillows and blankets, and he would reach under the blankets and try to do things. I would try to push him off but he was bigger and stronger and older, and it was in front of everybody. 'I don't know how I didn't say anything but I just didn't know anything. 'He would put his hands under my pants, under my underwear. Before he left any place he would say we weren't doing anything, we were just laying down. I didn't know, I was a kid. '[The next incident was] behind the curtains in my living room. I was at least seven or eight. 'Every time that we would go up there I could just look at him and he would give me a certain look and I would just know if it was going to happen. 'It's not just me that he did these things to but I know [the other victim] would never come forward. She said she would deny it either way. 'He always was just very charming and personable with everyone. But he was different behind closed doors with me. 'For the first time in my life, I'm not afraid of him.' Source: Orlando Sentinel . In the last encounter, he . ordered her to lay on a bed beside him and began massaging her. When she felt that he was aroused, she ran from the house. Later, she and her parents . confronted him at a restaurant, and he said he was sorry, she claimed. She added: 'He always was just, you . know, very charming and personable with everyone... and just would laugh . and entertain everybody. But he was different behind closed doors with . me.' Zimmerman's attorney, Mark O'Mara, had argued that the witness's interview with police should not be released. O'Mara said the statement 'is not relevant' to the shooting of Martin and would 'serve to reignite and potentially enhance the widespread public hostility toward Mr. Zimmerman,' the Sentinel reported. According to the transcript Witness 9 also told Sanford police that Zimmerman does not like blacks. In the audio-recorded interview . released today, she reiterated her claim but did not go into any detail . of why she made the assumption. Zimmerman's family, she said, 'don't . like black people if they don't act like white people. They like black . people if they act white'. When asked if she witnessed Zimmerman disparage blacks or act as if he hated blacks, she replied: 'No'. The allegations against 28-year-old . Zimmerman are the latest twist since his arrest over the death of . 17-year-old Martin following a confrontation in February in Sanford, . Florida. Zimmerman claims he acted in self defense and cited Florida's 'stand your ground' law as an explanation for the killing. Prosecutors say Zimmerman assumed Trayvon was about to commit a crime, followed him then murdered him. Killed: Zimmerman (right) is accused of shooting dead Trayvon Martin (left), an unarmed 17 year old, in a gated community in February in Sanford, Florida. The death sparked rallies across the country . Claims: Zimmerman, pictured reenacting the attack the day after, said he acted in self defense . Lawyers . for Zimmerman unsuccessfully tried to block the jail calls from being . released following applications by the media, including the Orlando . Sentinel. It was from . calls made from the county jail that led to Zimmerman's bail being . revoked after it was found he had lied about his finances. The judge set a new bail of $1 million. But fewer than 24 hours later, he was free after posting the $1 million bail raised by his defense support fun. He is now awaiting trial. Legal experts said it was unlikely witness 9's statement will be used in any trial as it is too prejudicial.","Claims made by witness for the prosecution in newly-released evidence .

Mitt Romney yesterday led Republicans in another attack on Barack Obama's foreign policy, criticising the President for describing the murder of the U.S. ambassador to Libya as a mere 'bump in the road'. The criticism came as Mr Obama once again changed the language he used to describe the attack, which occurred in Benghazi two weeks ago and which he said was 'not just a mob action' when he appeared on The View with his wife Michelle. The GOP challenger's advisers say the recent unrest in the Middle East has made voters question the President's foreign-policy credentials, an area in which he has until now led Mr Romney thanks to the mission which killed Osama bin Laden last year. The most devastating incident was the raid on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi on September 11 which killed ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. Scroll down for video . Attacks: Barack Obama, pictured on The View with Barbara Walters, has been criticised for his foreign policy . Mr Romney was not the only Republican to challenge Mr Obama on foreign policy on Monday. Eric Cantor, the House majority leader, said: 'Israel continues to find itself on the receiving end of harsh language by the President and the White House. 'There is a somewhat continued pattern of throwing Israel under the bus when Israel stands as our closest ally.' And the National Republican Senatorial Committee issued challenges to Democratic candidates in several races to 'share their view' on Mr Obama's remarks in an interview with CBS's 60 Minutes over the weekend. Aggression: Mitt Romney said the recent unrest in the Middle East was more than a 'bump in the road' Opposition: House majority leader Eric Cantor argued that Mr Obama should be closer to Israel's government . In the interview, Mr Obama was responding when asked if recent events in the Middle East gave him pause for supporting governments that came to power after the Arab Spring. He said he has long noted that events were going to be rocky, adding that the question itself 'presumes that somehow we could have stopped this wave of change'. 'I think it was absolutely the right thing for us to align ourselves with democracy, universal rights,' he said. 'But I was pretty certain and continue to be pretty certain that there are going to be bumps in the road because, you know, in a lot of these places the one organising principle has been Islam.' He added: 'There are strains of extremism, and anti-Americans, and anti-Western sentiments and you know can be tapped into by demagogues.' Fury: Protests have been raging in the Muslim world over a U.S.-made video mocking the Prophet Muhammad . Mr Romney was eager to talk about the topic, squeezing interviews with three television networks into his schedule and touching on the subject at the beginning of a rally in Pueblo, Colorado. 'I can't imagine saying something like the assassination of ambassadors is a bump in the road, when you look at the entire context, the assassination, the Muslim Brotherhood president being elected in Egypt, 20,000 people killed in Syria, Iran close to becoming a nuclear nation, that these are far from being bumps in the road,' he told ABC. 'They represent events that are spinning out of the kind of influence we'd like to have. We're at the mercy of events rather than shaping the events in the Middle East.' U.S. officials are investigating the deaths in Libya, which occurred when the consulate was breached.In his appearance on The View, the President avoided a direct answer when asked if the attack had been terrorism. 'There's no doubt that the kind of weapons that were used, the ongoing assault, that it wasn't just a mob action. What's clear is that, around the world, there are still a lot of threats out there,' he said. Mr Romney intends to return to the subject of international affairs and discuss foreign aid, trade agreements and international development when he addresses the Clinton Global Initiative in New York on Tuesday, according to a source. The candidate, like Mr Cantor, took a jab at Mr Obama's handling of relations with Israel on Monday.'The president doesn't have time to actually spend time with leaders of these nations, particularly Bibi Netanyahu,' he said. 'I find that very troubling.'","GOP candidate says U.S. administration is 'at the mercy of events'

Living in Florida, it is not uncommon to spot an alligator swimming in a creek or resting on the shore of a lake on any given day, but even a seasoned trapper was caught off guard when he got a call about a 14-foot reptile. Lane Stephens, a contracted alligator trapper with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC), said he pulled the scaly monster out of Lake Talquin on August 11, making it the fourth critter to exceed 11 feet in the last few months. Stephens has been catching and harvesting gators for the state agency for three years, and said that his initial reaction to the size of the animal was shock. Deadly catch: Alligator trapper Lane Stephens posing with his monstrous trophy measuring at whopping 14 feet . ‘I didn’t know it was as large as it was,’ he told the Tallahassee Democrat. ‘I knew it was an extremely large gator because the complainant had told me it was an extremely large alligator (that had come onto her property). ‘I didn’t know exactly how big until we got him back to the boat landing and started trying to load him in my truck. Nobody is going to load a gator that size into their boat.’ At 14 feet, Stephens’ latest catch rivals the longest alligator ever trapped in Florida, which was a male reptile measuring at 14 feet and three-and-a-half inches that was captured in Lake Washington, according to FWC spokesman Stan Kirkland. Kirkland said there are estimated 1.3 million gators living in Florida. Under the FWC’s policy, alligators measuring more than four feet in length are harvested – or killed - for hide, meat and skulls. Danger zone: The behemoth gator was pulled out of Lake Talquin 10 miles west of Tallahassee . Stephens caught the alligator using a baited line, which only contract nuisance trappers with the FWC are allowed to use under state law. According to the trapper, it took about two hours to harvest the gator from the time it took the bait, WCTV reported. Lake Talquin is located on the Ochlockonee River between Leon County and Gadsden County about 10 miles west of Tallahassee. People are not advised to swim there due to the lake’s dangerous fauna. Kirkland said some 20,000 alligators are harvested in Florida each year. Gator hunting season lasts from August 15 to November 1.","Contracted alligator trapper Lane Stephens caught the massive reptile in Lake Talquin .

Kennedy was indifferent to space travel - until he realised he could use it for political gain . Despite rousing speeches in the early Sixties about his determination to put a man on the moon, U.S. President John F Kennedy was initially very hesitant about space travel. Correspondence between the newly inaugurated JFK and vice-president Lyndon Johnson in 1961 show that the reason behind the space programme was a chance at political victory over the Soviet Union – not exploring the universe. During a 1962 meeting with NASA, the 45-year-old president said that he was ‘not that interested in space'. Space exploration was John F. Kennedy’s weakest area during his first few months in office, according to Hugh Sidey, Life magazine's White House correspondent. It was the area he was least confident with and records show the young president did not take much interest in educating himself about space, prioritising other matters. His own science adviser said that Mr Kennedy simply ‘hasn’t thought much about it’. Mr Kennedy’s indifference to space stretched back to his days as a Massachusetts senator in the Fifties, according to the biography John F. Kennedy: History, Memory, Legacy. During a dinner with Charles Draper, an MIT professor and aerospace pioneer, JFK and his brother Robert F Kennedy ‘ridiculed’ Professor Draper’s pitch about space travel, and ‘could not be convinced that all rockets were not a waste of money and space navigation even worse’. Speech: President Kennedy during his passionate speech about space travel and putting a man on the moon, at Rice University in 1962 . However, when the Soviet Union sent the first man into space in 1961, a mere three months after Kennedy had been sworn in as president, the president began to see the political benefits of exploring space. In the wake of the Bay of Pigs, President Kennedy was in need of a political victory, both to show the strength of his government and to demonstrate superiority over the Soviet Union. The answer, it seems, was to beat Soviet in the race to space. As cosmonaut Yuri Gargarin - the first human in space - returned to Earth in April 1961, fears began to grow in the U.S. that the Soviets were technologically more advanced. Space run: After the Bay of Pigs and Russian Yuri Gargarin's safe return to Earth, John F. Kennedy, right, asked vice-president Johnson, left, how soon the U.S. could send a man to the moon . Mr Kennedy turned to vice-president Johnson, and it becomes clear from the letter sent by the president that there was only one reason for his support of the space programme. His letter to Mr Johnson from late spring 1961 reads: ‘Do we have a chance of beating the Soviets by putting a laboratory in space, or by a trip around the Moon, or by a rocket to land on the Moon, or by a rocket to go to the Moon and back with a man? Man on the Moon: Buzz Aldrin photographed by Neil Armstrong after landing on the moon, six years after Kennedy's death . ‘Is there any other space program which promises dramatic results in which we could win?’ Not long afterwards, on May 25, President Kennedy announced the U.S.’s new goal of landing a man on the moon in an address to Congress. ‘First, I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the Earth. ‘No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important for the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish.’ Four months later in a speech at Rice University, Kennedy said: ‘The exploration of space will go ahead, whether we join in it or not, and it is one of the great adventures of all time, and no nation which expects to be the leader of other nations can expect to stay behind in this race for space. ‘We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.’ Nearly six years after Mr Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, on July 20 1969, Apollo 11 had landed and the following day Neil Armstrong made the ‘giant leap for mankind’ and took the first steps on the Moon.","Enthusiastic about a chance at political victory, not space travel, and determined not to be upstaged by the Soviet Union ."
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 00:57 EST, 30 September 2012 . Three months after pledging to turn her life around and get a job, a lottery winner convicted of fraud has died from a suspected overdose. In June Amanda Clayton pleaded no contest to fraud, having continued to collect state welfare handouts despite pocketing her $1 million prize. She accepted her punishment and was said by her lawyer to be trying to move on. But on Saturday morning she was found dead at her Michigan home. Probation: Amanda Clayton, 25, was still claiming $200 a month in food stamps despite winning $1 million on a state lottery last year. Ecorse police Sgt. Cornelius Herring . confirmed that the 25-year-old's was discovered at about 9am, thought . to be the result of a drug overdose. No further details were given and Clayton's relatives did not immediately return a phone message for comment. Clayton won the Michigan Lottery in September 2011, continuing to collect $5,475 in food handouts over the subsequent months. She was sentenced to nine months’ probation, ordered to pay court costs and fines after pleading no . contest to fraud last month, and told by the judge to get a job. At the time of her death she had repaid about $5,500 in food aid and medical benefits. The Michigan Department of Human . Services says Clayton didn't inform the state about her post-tax lottery . windfall of $735,000 last year. Flood says Clayton did make an attempt but decided not to fight the case and move on with her life. If she had fought the case and been convicted of the two felony charges, she could have faced up to four years in prison. Laws: Local politicians are pushing for a change in the law that prevents lottery winners from still being able to claim state benefits . Gov. Rick Snyder signed a law in . April that requires lottery officials to tell the Department of Human . Services about new winners. 'It's simply common sense that . million dollar lottery winners forfeit their right to public . assistance,' Attorney General Bill Schuette said at Clayton's April . arraignment. Clayton chose a $700,000 lump sum, before taxes, last fall after winning the jackpot on 'Make Me Rich!' a Michigan lottery game show. The case came to light March when the 24-year-old was filmed outside her home where a U-Haul van was waiting to take her possessions to a new . home she had bought with cash. Clayton also had a new car. She told Detroit TV station WDIV at the time that she thought it might have been OK to keep using food stamps because she wasn't working. The state Department of Human Services has said it was Clayton's responsibility to report her dramatic change in wealth within 10 days. She was later dropped from the food program. Deserving: Standing outside her new house, pictured, Clayton argued in April that she deserved the benefits and is also struggling being without a job and having now two houses . Clayton wasn't the first Michigan lottery winner to keep public benefits. Last spring, a TV station reported that Leroy Fick, 60, of Bay County, was using the food program despite winning an $850,000 lump sum prize in 2010. He told state officials about his wealth but was allowed to temporarily keep his card because lump-sum windfalls at that time were not counted as regular income under the program. The state has since banned anyone with assets of more than $5,000, excluding a car, from the food stamp program. That ban knocked Fick off the rolls.

The bizarre theory, which they admit they cannot categorically prove, is based largely on the fact that the fabled 15th century explorer had the same handwriting as Ibizans of the time. And now, politicians have vowed to re-brand the island - better known for booze-cruise Brits, all-night clubbing and hard-core house music - as the home of America's discoverer. Ibiza calling: The bizarre theory apparently disproves the widespread belief that Christopher Columbus was either Italian, Portuguese, or from Galicia in the north-west of Spain . That is despite them acknowledging that they cannot prove the theory, espoused by self-styled investigative journalist Nito Verdera, is 100 per cent accurate. They also admit they truly cannot verify whether Columbus was born on the island, or even if he lived there for any period of time whatsoever. But councillors voted unanimously yesterday to formally advertise the hypothesis that Columbus was the son of merchants who had a house in Dalt Vila, the medieval area of Ibiza Town. Re brand: Politicians say Columbus was from Ibiza Town and want to re-brand the island on the back of the claim . Party isle: Ibiza is better known for booze-cruise Brits, all-night clubbing and hard-core house music . It came with one condition - that it did not cost taxpayers' on the White Isle a single Euro. The claim has been met with widespread scepticism, with many taking to Twitter to say it is simply a publicity stunt to attract tourists to Ibiza's cash-strapped holiday resorts. But Verdera, who claims to have worked as a merchant sailor and pilot, insisted that the seafarer had a 'geocultural origin' from the island. And the self-styled journalist's alleged 50 years of work had apparently disproved the widespread belief that Columbus was either Italian, Portuguese, or from Galicia in the north-west of Spain. Ibizan hand: A ledger written by Columbus. Journalist Nito Verdera claims he had typically Ibizan handwriting of the time . Ibiza to America: An illustration . of Christopher Columbus setting foot on American soil for the first . time in 1492 . Verdera's theory was backed by opposition political party Nova Alternativa, whose councillor Antonio Villalonga originally proposed the motion. He told 20minutos.es that the theory 'was fundamentally sound, based on historic and linguistic studies.' He pointed to the way Columbus has used coastal names from the Balearic islands in naming areas in the Carribean - for example Caragoler, Punta de la Mata and Punta de la Rama. Another indication, he said, was Columbus' writing style could be traced back to Ibizan residents. Villalonga added: 'Even though there could be an error, everything points to this being true. It's just to give someone who did something amazing the correct recognition.' He said there were many ways in which the new found origin of Columbus could be exploited, but that it would not see the council spending much money. He said: The council will not spend €50,000 in books, but if it could spend €500 on a walking trail through his family home then that could happen.' Party isle to Caribbean isle: It is claimed that Columbus was in fact from Ibiza Town, in Ibiza, off the coast of Spain. Born in 1451, he sailed to the New World in search of the Orient in 1492, but landed in the Bahamas . Columbus heroically led his crew into the unknown as he set sail for the New World on a voyage of discovery in 1492. He was in fact trying to find a westward sea passage to the Orient when he stumbled across the Americas. Born between August and October 1451, Columbus was the son of a weaver and small-time . merchant. As a teenager, Christopher went to sea, and is believed to have travelled extensively before finally making Portugal his base. It was here that he initially . attempted to gain royal patronage for . his 'enterprise of the Indies'. Finally he persuaded King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella to sponsor the . expedition and, on 3 August 1492, Columbus and his fleet of three ships, . the Santa Maria, the Pinta and the Niña, set sail across the Atlantic. Ten days later they came ashore in the Bahamas. He went on to land on a series of other islands in the Caribbean, including Cuba and . Hispaniola, and returned to Spain in triumph where he was made 'admiral of . the Seven Seas' and viceroy of the Indies. Despite his successes, he has been blamed by some historians for bringing syphilis back to Europe.","Local politicians have vowed to re-brand the .

She also displayed derogatory posters about him using the acronym A.R.S.E in full view of patients at the University College London hospital where they both worked in central London. Nurse Ellen Johnson faces being struck off for bombarding a surgeon with abusive emails after complaining about medical treatment to her hip . A conduct and competence committee found all allegations against Johnson proved, but the hearing ran out of time before it could consider whether her actions. Details of the treatment she received and her medical ailments were heard in private during the week-long hearing. But in one of the emails Johnson, who walks with the aid of a crutch, referred to her hip condition when she said: 'I did not let you into my life and into my hip journey to make me sick. 'You have not got the right to do this to me or hurt my hips. I wish that I was dead.' Mr Witt is listed as a consultant orthopaedic surgeon who specialises in hip and knee surgery and joint replacement. Sarah-Jane Smiles, for the NMC, told the panel that the emails were sent between early 2010, and December 2011. 'In an email on September 24, 2010, Ms Johnson stated, ""you did this to me you b****d, you will pay for this"".' Ellen Johnson put up posters about Johan Witt in full view of patients at the University College London hospital, central London . In another email she called him weasel and went on to tell him that he would pay for what he had done to her. 'The emails got more threatening towards Mr Witt and were inappropriate because the majority of them use bad language and make a personal attack on a member of staff,' said Ms Smiles. On one occasion Mr Witt's secretary noted that a single email had been sent a total of 30 times within a 10 minute period. Johnson had also made and displayed posters on the ward, the content of which was 'particularly derogatory' towards staff and the hospital. Ms Smiles told the panel that one of the posters displayed the acronym A.R.S.E 'for effect' although it is not known what the letters stood for. Johnson admitted sending the emails but denied that her behaviour had been inappropriate. She said she had disagreed with Mr Witt's diagnosis and treatment and had launched a clinical negligence claim in May this year. Asked by Ms Smiles whether her emails were inappropriate, Johnson replied: 'I would say that if I was receiving these from a patient, I would be thinking ""what on earth have I done?"". 'I would be disappointed with myself for leaving someone feeling like this.'

After being hit by the worst deluge in 30 years  last month, many of us have barely finished mopping up. Now, however, large parts of the country are facing a repeat performance with forecasters warning that heavy rains and floods are on their way back.

Doomed: Spencer Court in Tyneside (pictured) will be demolished after its foundations were washed away by raging flood waters . Most counties will see almost an inch – an amount which is normally no cause for concern, but forecasters warned of a ‘cumulative effect’ in areas where the ground is still sodden from last month’s downpours. A Met Office spokesman said: ‘Even relatively low rainfall could cause a problem because after such a lot of rain at the end of September there is still a lot of water in the ground. ‘With rain last night, more on Friday and then more on Sunday, it is the cumulative effect that could be a problem.’ The Environment Agency put out 14 flood warnings, with the worst expected in the North. Two of the most severe warnings were last night issued to residents of York who were told the Ouse – which burst its  banks in last month’s deluge – could flood again.

Chris Burton, a forecaster for MeteoGroup, said southern areas could see between an inch (20mm) and one and a half inches (40mm) of rain, and two and a half (60mm) on higher ground. ‘On Friday night there is going to be rather heavy rain across southern parts of England and Wales,’ he said. ‘The rest of the country will be quite cold and chilly with showers. There has been quite a lot of rain in Wales so the ground is quite saturated.’ Winds of up to 60 miles per hour along the south coast last night were predicted to die down by this morning. The Met Office also issued heavy rain warnings for South-West England, the West Midlands and Wales. A break from the downpours is expected tomorrow, with temperatures dipping as the skies clear.

American billionaire William Koch has been told he cannot sue an auction house over his purchase of £300,000 of counterfeit wine - because he waited too long to file his case. Koch, brother of businessmen and . conservative political activists Charles and David, had accused . Christie's of rubber stamping as authentic a cache of wine said to have . been owned by the third U.S. president Thomas Jefferson, while knowing it was worthless . plonk. However, his claims died on the vine after a federal appeals court in Manhattan ruled he had waited too long to file his lawsuit against the auction house. Too slow: William Koch, left, was told it was too late to take legal action over a counterfeit cache of wine supposedly once owned by former U.S. President Thomas Jefferson, right . Koch, the founder of Oxbow Group energy company, failed to conduct timely due diligence when doubts were first raised about the wine's authenticity, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found. The billionaire bought four bottles of red wine in 1987 and 1988 that was said to be from 1787 and with the letters 'Th.J.' etched in the glass. Jefferson was a wine aficionado and served as an envoy to France in the late 18th century. The wines at issue were purported to have been discovered in Paris. But starting in 2000, reports surfaced that cast doubt on the origin of the bottles, clues that 'would suggest to a reasonably intelligent person that the wine was not authentic', the appeals court wrote. Yet Koch waited until 2005 to begin his investigation into the wine's origin, the court said. Koch's claim, the court concluded, 'is therefore time-barred'. Koch had accused Christie's (pictured) of rubber stamping as authentic a cache of wine, while knowing it was worthless plonk . Koch purchased the wine from dealer Hardy Rodenstock through intermediaries. In his lawsuit, filed in 2010, Koch contended that Rodenstock and the long-time head of Christie's wine department, Michael Broadbent, were associates in the purported fraud. Koch, whose worth is about $4billion according to Forbes magazine, said Christie's had agreed to promote Rodenstock's reputation and sell his wines. His lawsuit also said Christie's had lobbied Monticello, Jefferson's Virginia home, to vouch for the wine. The appeals court ruling upheld the dismissal of the case by U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones. Maura Grinalds, a lawyer for Christie's, did not immediately return a call for comment on the ruling. Brad Goldstein, a spokesman for Koch, repeated the wine collector's allegation that the auction house conspired to sell fake wine. Goldstein said: 'They got away with it. They escaped on a technicality and their behavior warrants closer scrutiny.' Meanwhile, Koch has been pursuing a lawsuit against Rodenstock. In May, a magistrate judge recommended that Rodenstock be fined over $600,000 in damages. Judge Jones, who is overseeing this case, has yet to decide whether to adopt the magistrate's findings.

The claims are made in an excerpt of the biography Untouchable and published in November's Vanity Fair. Sullivan reports that Michael's mother Katherine Jackson also arrived that night and entered the house, where she telephoned Grace Rwaramba, the recently terminated longtime nanny to Michael's children. The book says that according to Rwaramba, Katherine said: 'Grace, the children are crying. They are asking about you. 'They can't believe that their father died. Grace, you remember Michael used to hide cash at the house? I'm here. Where can it be?'

Katherine Jackson and her daughters made it clear that they wouldn't be leaving anytime soon.

Documents showed the family spent more than £22,000 on Jackson's burial outfit and usher costumes. More than £2,000 was spent on framing a photograph of Jackson next to the casket, and £7,000 on invitations and programmes.

More than £516,000 went on cemetery and funeral charges, including the purchase of other plots in the mausoleum that houses Jackson. Court documents reveal that the family had received a warning from undertakers that unless payment was received swiftly the funeral would be unable to proceed. Lawyers for the singer's mother Katherine requested money from the estate, insisting that cancelling would cause the family 'public embarrassment and added grief'. They added: 'Mrs Jackson and her family wish to honour her son by a funeral that seeks to offer solace to his multitude of fans and by which the family also may be comforted.' It was also claimed that the costs were 'entirely commensurate with the deceased's worldwide status as an entertainer'.

The twin brother of shot Pc David Rathband and the widower of murdered Pc Sharon Beshenivsky have demanded that British police routinely carry guns in the wake of the killing of two female officers. Darren Rathband, whose brother was was shot and blinded by gun maniac Raoul Moat in July 2010 and was found dead at his home 17 months later, wrote on Twitter: ‘Give them more than a bloody piece of plastic and some spray. Tragic!’ His call was backed by Paul Beshenivsky, whose wife was gunned down when she attended a botched robbery at a travel agent in Bradford, West Yorkshire, in 2005. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Pc David Rathband, left, was blinded in a gun attack. Yesterday's double killing has prompted his twin brother Darren, pictured right with David in Australia, to call for police to carry firearms . Mr Beshenivsky said the killing of . officers Pc Fiona Bone, 32, and Pc Nicola Hughes, 23, in Tameside, . Greater Manchester, on Tuesday should 'open the public's eyes' to the . need for police to be armed. But chiefs have warned against the . move, with one insisting it was the 'clear view of the British police . service from top to bottom' that officers would rather not be armed. And Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said there would be 'considerable risks' to giving every police officer a gun. The Home Office said there were no plans to routinely arm officers. Darren Rathband, a former policeman in Staffordshire now serving in South Australia, said it ‘beggars belief’ that British officers routinely face criminals unarmed. He added: 'How many officers need to die before the powers realise it is the 21st century? ‘No job is a routine job and there is always the potential for conflict. We don’t go on jobs where people are happy to see us. Gunned down: Pc Sharon Beshenivsky (left) was shot dead in Bradford, West Yorkshire, in 2005. Her widower, Paul Beshenivsky (right), believes police should be routinely armed . ‘I am angry some other families have now lost a daughter, sister, mother or wife and it makes me angry that the thin blue line is getting thinner and thinner. ‘If the public knew how thin that blue line was, they would be ashamed.’ Mr Beshenivsky, whose wife was a West Yorkshire Police officer, said: 'You wouldn’t think it’d happen again, but it has.' He told ITV News at Ten: 'I think policing, as regarding going to scenes of crimes, should be monitored better, and I think police, in honesty, should be armed, walking into situations that they’re not totally aware of. Victims: The killing of Pc Fiona Bone (left) and Pc Nicola Hughes (right) has prompted calls for police officers to be routinely armed . 'You can’t have armed response at every situation, but I think, as an officer being armed, walk into a situation, feeling more comfortable, walking into that situation, thinking, ""I could respond to that situation"".' Pc Beshenivsky, a 38-year-old mother-of-three, who also had two stepchildren, was shot and killed on her youngest daughter’s fourth birthday as she responded to an alarm call. Her colleague, Pc Teresa Milburn, was wounded. Unlike many of their overseas counterparts, British beat constables are not routinely armed and instead rely on 6,500 specialist firearms officers. The president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, Sir Hugh Orde, warned against a rush to routinely arm officers. 'Guns don't necessarily solve the . problem,' he said. 'You only have to look at the American experience. Many colleagues in America are lost without even drawing their gun at . close ranges.' Sir Hugh . said it was the 'clear view of the British police service from top to . bottom' that officers prefer to be unarmed because the public dislike . approaching constables bearing weapons. He said minimum use of force and intervention was the 'bedrock' of Britain's policing model. He . told BBC Radio 4's Today programme policing is 'a risk business', . adding: 'As we speak, officers will be responding to calls not knowing . what they will get to and not knowing exactly what they will be dealing . with when they arrive. 'It's just a harsh fact of policing and, tragically on occasions, things go horribly wrong.' The Chief Constable of Greater Manchester force has also rejected calls for more guns on the streets. Sir Peter Fahy said: ‘We are passionate that the British style of policing is routinely unarmed policing. Concerns: Sir Hugh Orde, president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, warned against a rush to routinely arm officers . ‘Sadly we know from the experience in America that having armed officers certainly does not mean, sadly, that police officers do not end up getting shot.’ Mr Clegg said: 'I don't think this is the time to rush to instant judgments, this really is a time for mourning and support, of course, for the family and friends of the two women who have been killed. 'We have a long tradition in this country, which is a great tradition, of policing in the community, of the police being part of the public and the public supporting and giving their consent to the police. 'I think if we were, in an instant to, in a sense, arm our police to the teeth so they become separate from the public, that would be quite a big change which would have considerable risks attached to it. 'I think it is the kind of thing that you need to look at very carefully and certainly not, even though I know emotions are running high, in an instant way after this terrible, terrible tragedy.' Passionate: Greater Manchester Police Chief Peter Fahy does not want to arm officers . Mr Clegg, speaking at a central London youth club, added: 'Of course there are going to be lots of questions about the nature of armed violence and gang violence in Manchester and elsewhere.' But he added: 'I really just think right now everybody is reeling with shock, that these two brave women have been gunned down in this extraordinarily cruel way.' Jayne Willetts, of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said: 'We have firearms officers regularly patrolling the streets of the UK already and colleagues up and down the country have very mixed views about carrying firearms. It is a very personal choice.' Speaking on ITV Daybreak, she described the killings of Pc Bone and Pc Hughes as 'absolutely dreadful'. 'It is difficult for our colleagues who have got to carry on with the job today, because our job goes on, we are professionals and we have a service to deliver,"" she said. 'Yesterday was absolutely dreadful, for every police officer and part of our family across the UK. 'It made me feel sick to the bottom of my stomach when I found out the news. It is the call that we dread. 'We do work together, we pull together as a large family - from the communities as well as the police family - to look after each other.' Lord Tebbit, who was a senior Cabinet Minister in Margaret Thatcher's government, said he would be 'reluctant to see' routine arming of the police but called for the reintroduction of capital punishment to be considered. Writing for the Daily Telegraph, he put: 'Effective policing demands that the relationship between the police officer and the public should be a comfortable one, reflecting that the constable is a member of the public and historically had few powers which were not also possessed by any other citizen. 'The carrying of guns would widen the gap which has grown between the police and the public in recent years. 'That does not mean that the whole question of the deterrent effect of capital punishment should not be re-examined.' A Home Office spokesman said: 'As the Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police, Sir Peter Fahy, and Sir Hugh Orde of ACPO have clearly expressed, the British style of policing is based on policing by consent with police officers part of the communities they serve. 'This is not something we should readily give up and the majority of police in this country do not want to be routinely armed.'

"By . Anna Edwards . PUBLISHED: . 09:32 EST, 5 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:21 EST, 8 October 2012 . Indian workers were forced to give their managers gifts of perfume and a duvet so they could be allowed take holiday, it was claimed today. Goan staff at the Great Western Hospital in Swindon, Wiltshire, handed over cash, jewellery, alcohol, and cigarettes in return for annual leave, it was alleged in an Employment Tribunal case. Now the group of cleaners who work for private contractor Carillion, have launched a group claim for racial discrimination. Details of the claims emerged in papers submitted to the Employment Tribunal, where it was claimed that the Indians’ white counterparts were not subjected to the same rules. Managers at the Great Western Hospital in Swindon are accused of demanding gifts from Indian staff who wanted time off work . The workers, and their union the GMB, claim that the staff had been subject to the practice from as early as 2007. They also claim they were exposed to a culture of intimidation and fear by supervisors, and were victimised and faced 'harassment' when they tried to join a union. Carillion - which runs some of the non-medical services of the hospital - strongly denies the practice amounted to racial discrimination and said the main manager responsible no longer worked for the company. Jose Estrocio, a claimant in the group action and a GMB rep for the workers, said: 'We are in a developed country and had to give money and gold for holidays.' Most of the staff were recruited in Britain to work for Carillion as porters, cleaners, and members of the housekeeping staff in Swindon’s biggest hospital. Supervisors implemented a system where they expected gifts in return for favours, but, according to the claim, their demands were only made to non-white employees. Carillion (pictured) has denied that the practice amounted to racial discrimination and said the main manager responsible no longer worked for the company . Paulo Fernandes, a union representative, claimed that when he applied for a porter’s job, he was asked what he would give a female manager in return. He was then asked for a gold chain of a certain length and told it had to be visible and not too long or too short, according to the papers. It is then alleged that Mr Fernandes, accompanied by a friend, handed over a chain, belonging to his wife at the manager’s house. Another claimant, Irene de Souza, wanted to travel to Goa for 10 days in January 2011. She claims that a manager asked her for a gift in return for the time off and she felt compelled to hand over perfume and a watch worth £25 - both a present from her children and something she found particularly 'distressing'. The papers also claim Carillion carried out an investigation and the claimant cleaners were interviewed and told that their evidence was confidential. Accusations: The cleaners were employed by contractor Carillion . However, in June, the company told the workers they would face a disciplinary hearing because they had given gifts in return for benefits, the papers allege. A spokesman for Carillion admitted that there were incidents of gift giving for favours from managers but added that they had been investigated thoroughly and disciplinary procedures put in place. The company stated it would vigorously defend itself against the claims. No date for the Employment Tribunal hearing has yet been set. They said: 'In the circumstances it was appropriate that Carillion carried out disciplinary processes with employees who admitted giving or facilitating gifts for advantage. 'This is an ongoing process but outcomes so far have included training to those who gave gifts for advantage - not sanction. 'To be clear: Carillion will not tolerate racism or racist remarks from any of our employees, and racism goes completely against all our values as an organisation, as well as our policies. 'Claims are presently being subjected to a formal case management process by the tribunal. 'It is only once this is completed that we will have a clear understanding of which cases the tribunal will expect Carillion to defend.' Carillion is one of the UK’s leading companies in providing support services to local and central government. In a 2012 interim report, entitled ‘Making Tomorrow a Better Place’, the company’s revenue is listed as £2.2bn with underlying profit before taxation amounting to £73.1m.","Managers allegedly asked non-white employees to hand over gifts, 60 workers claim in employment tribunal .

The depth of the relationship between Andrew Mitchell and Rwanda’s hardline leader was revealed yesterday as it emerged the senior Tory has visited the African state eight times in the past six years. Mr Mitchell has been criticised by human rights groups for lifting a freeze on £16million of British aid to President Paul Kagame’s regime on his final day as International Development Secretary last month. Documents released by the Department for International Development suggest Mr Mitchell  had promised Kagame he would continue pumping in aid money despite concerns about the regime’s dire human rights record. All smiles: Paul Kagame and Andrew Mitchell shake hands in 2009 . Most of the visits related to Project Umabano, the voluntary project set up by Mr Mitchell and David Cameron in 2007 to help 'detoxify' their party's uncaring image . Mr Mitchell – now the Tory Chief Whip and recently in the spotlight over his alleged ‘plebs’ rant at No 10 police – is thought to have visited Rwanda at least eight times in six years, meeting Kagame and his ministers on several occasions. Most of the visits related to Project Umabano, the voluntary project set up by Mr Mitchell and David Cameron in 2007 to help ‘detoxify’ their party’s uncaring image. The revelations will focus fresh attention on the unlikely friendship between Mr Mitchell and Kagame, whose regime is accused of repression against political opponents at home and arming a murderous rebellion in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo. Internal DFID documents, released . under the Freedom of Information Act, show that in a phone call in . February 2011 the men discussed Mr Mitchell’s decision to increase aid . to Rwanda from £60million a year to £90million, much of it poured into . the Kagame regime’s coffers as ‘budget support’. A memo recorded: ‘Secretary of State . said this reflected the UK’s long-term support to Rwanda (including from . the PM, who had visited as leader of the Opposition in 2006).President . Kagame was very grateful.' Accused: President Kagame at Amahoro Stadium . Two months earlier Mr Mitchell had . flown to Rwanda to see Kagame for a ‘90-minute tete-a-tete followed by . lunch’ in which they had ‘friendly but robust’ exchanges. That meeting followed Kagame’s controversial re-election with 93 per cent of the vote. Mr Mitchell reluctantly froze the £16million aid payment to Rwanda after a devastating UN report on the regime’s support for the bloody rebellion in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Other major donors, including the US and Germany, have continued their aid bans. But, in his final act as International Development Secretary, Mr Mitchell released the money.

Starbucks is set to unveil a new line of baked goods that will include yoghurt muffins, loaf cakes and even spinach croissants. The coffee giant is hoping to expand its range of food items, which are purchased by one in three customers and generates around $1.5billion a year in revenue. Nine stores in San Francisco will trial the products with a view to rolling them out nationally, although there is no time frame for this as yet. Scroll down for video . Power to the people: Spinach croissants will among a number of food new items being trialled by Starbucks over the coming weeks (file picture) Among the items being tested are a whole wheat spinach croissant, a tomato, cheese and herb croissant, a blueberry yoghurt muffin and a raspberry passion fruit loaf cake. Many of them will be served warm, unlike its current line-up of baked goods. The move comes after the Seattle-based company bought small San Francisco bakery chain La Boulange in a $100million deal in the summer. At the time, Starbucks said it hoped to use items produced by La Boulange to popularise the French bakery experience in the U.S. like it had done with the Italian espresso. A tough sell? Popeye would no doubt be impressed with the spinach croissants on offer at Starbucks, but it remains to be seen if they will take off across the U.S . The deal could also strengthen the firm's position in a fast-growing segment of the restaurant industry dominated by Panera Bread Co, which offers baked goods in a seated setting. Its current range of bagels, breakfast sandwiches and oatmeal will not be affected by the changes, it was reported by The Huffington Post. Spinach is a health powerhouse. It offers twice as much fibre as other greens and is an excellent source of beta-carotene, an antioxidant that can reduce the risk of heart disease and cancer. It also contains lutein, which helps prevent age-related macular degeneration. Serve raw, spinach is a good source of vitamin C, as well. Lisa Passe, a spokeswoman for Starbucks, said they would be handling the expansion 'week by week, figuring it out'. Other items on trial from La Boulange, which has 19 locations in the Bay Area, include a chocolate chip cookie, an almond cookie and vanilla shortbread cookie. Starbucks says it plans to expand La Boulange into a national presence in coming years. Earlier this year, Starbucks announced plans to attract evening trade by offering beer and wine on its menus. The company said it planned to bring the new items to a few Chicago-area cafes by the end of 2012 and is also testing wine and beer sales in Spain. But it did not expect to sell alcohol in all of its nearly 11,000 U.S. cafes.","Coffee giant hopes to bolster £1.5bn food revenue .

Despite seeing the defeat of his favoured candidate Mitt Romney, Donald Trump has refused to exit the political fray since Tuesday's election. His latest sally today was an attack on Chris Matthews, the MSNBC host who caused a controversy on Tuesday night when he said he was 'so glad' Hurricane Sandy had hit the Atlantic coast and allowed Barack Obama to be re-elected. The eccentric tycoon tweeted that 'MSNBC should fire him immediately', adding: 'Tweet me back if u think we should start a petition to fire @hardball_chris for his comments on Sandy & the death & destruction it caused.' Outspoken: Donald Trump has been very active on Twitter since seeing his side lose the election . Chris Matthews the outspoken and forthright host of MSNBC 'Hardball' caused outrage during Election Night coverage by saying he was 'so glad' superstorm Sandy aided President Obama's re-election . Trump has been particularly active on Twitter since Obama's re-election was confirmed, writing that the result was 'a total sham and a travesty' as he argued, 'Our country is now in serious and unprecedented trouble.' After his comments were denounced by Brian Williams, he flew into a rage at the NBC anchor, tweeting: 'Wouldn't you love to have my ratings?' The star of The Apprentice was a strong supporter of Romney - and the relationship between the two men has been blamed by some for leading to the candidate's landslide defeat. Chris Matthews' comments had earlier been greeted with outrage by Republicans and independents on Twitter. Assault: Trump called for Matthews to be fired over his controversial televised comments . 'What kind of sicko says they're so happy we had that hurricane last week? Seriously Chris Matthews is beyond revolting,' tweeted 'Christine915'. Others were more level headed in their criticism, with Justin Hill taking to the social networking site to say that, 'No amount of political points are worth even one life lost.' Another Twitter user called 'Stephanie Scanlon' called Matthews 'a disgusting excuse for a person', while 'Marcia Chimie' said that he was 'a disgrace to humanity.' Even in the MSNBC studio, where he was on a panel including Rachel Maddow, Matthews' comments caused an audible 'oooo', leading him to raise his hand to explain. Twitter was awash with outrage from members of the public upset with Chris Matthews comments regarding superstorm Sandy . The MSNBC host claimed that he was happy that Sandy had occurred because it gave President Obama a much needed boost in the polls . The 66-year-old news anchor clarified his comments on air as politically speaking - but the damage was already done . 'No, politically I should say - not in terms of hurting people,' explained a backtracking Matthews. 'The storm brought in possibilities for good politics.' Despite hailing the storm-of-a-lifetime for aiding the re-election of President Obama at the expense of Mitt Romney, the controversial MSNBC host took to Twitter where he clarified his statement. 'To clarify - I was thrilled at the cooperation between the President and state officials that made the country proud. Great bipartisanship,' he tweeted. 'Obviously I wasn't talking about the horror of the storm. I grew up on the Jersey shore,' Matthews wrote.

Devastation: Waves break in front of a destroyed amusement park wrecked by Superstorm Sandyin Seaside Heights, New Jersey . Aerial view: Seaside Heights, New Jersey, was surrounded by water after Superstorm Sandy lashed the Atlantic Coast . The death toll from Sandy has already exceeded 100 and many who were in the path of the storm in New Jersey and New York lost their property and were forced into emergency shelter - which some are still relying on. The massive weather system also caused mayhem on Election Day, with many voting districts and precincts facing power outages, fuel shortages and some had to light up their polling places with flares in the dark. Indeed, findings from the Pew Research Center's election weekend survey in the aftermath of the storm said that President Obama held a 48-percent to 45-percent lead over Romney among those likely to vote. This was compared to a week before the storm which had each candidate level on 47 per cent of the likely vote. The respected center polled 2,709 likely voters from October 31st to November 3rd in their final pre-election survey while the previous survey dated from October 24th to 28th.

In fact according to Pew, 69 per cent of all likely voters approved of the way President Obama handled the storm's impact and 46 per cent of Romney's supporters did too. More importantly for President Obama, 63 per cent of swing voters looked favourably on his handling of the storm and its effects. Analysts said that the storm boosted Obama's image among voters by visibly allowing him to show a bipartisan side. His rapprochement with New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and the manner in which he was publicly thanked by one of his fiercest critics was seen as damaging to Mitt Romney. This was especially the case as Chris Christie had been the keynote speaker at the Republican National Convention and had been one of Romney's most vocal supporters. Praise from Matthews: Republican presidential candidate and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney gives his concession speech in Boston last night . But, even before his massively controversial comments last night, Matthews had been ruffling feathers with his forthright political opinions during early Election Day coverage. One of his first targets were Americans who do not vote - describing them as idiots, before attacking those who vote for third party candidates. 'If you haven't voted, I don't want to talk to you,' said Matthews earlier in his broadcast. 'And if you vote for one of these numbskull third or fourth party candidates like Gary Johnson or Joe Steele and then you go ""Oh, I was surprised by what happened,"" well, you shouldn't be. 'Because idiots like you voted for a third or fourth party candidate and they don't know how how the system works: two choices.' President Barack Obama speaks at his election night party last night in Chicago . Indeed, Matthews capped off a memorable evening for himself by praising Mitt Romney's concession speech instead of attacking President Obama's victory one. 'I mean, I thought Romney’s speech last night was a piece of wonder,' said Matthews. 'I thought the way he came out alone and stood in one, as they say on Broadway, right out there by himself — not with the wife, with the shoulder to cry on or any of that — stood out there with manliness and grace, and did absolutely everything right. ‘ .

Jo and Ade Haigh had all but given up on their black and white pet, Charlie, who was nine when he left the house in Fareham, Hampshire, in 2006. However, Mrs Haigh spotted the cat when she was out walking and was able to verify that it was Charlie thanks to a microchip that had been fitted to him. Remarkable: Jo Haigh poses with her cat, Charlie, who has been found after going missing six years ago . When he first went missing the family put up 'lost' posters and contacted nearby vets' surgeries, but to no avail. But then Mrs Haigh spotted the family pet and took him to an animal shelter where she works to carry out tests on his microchip. The tiny electronic identification tag confirmed this was her Charlie, who she had cared for since he was seven weeks old. The couple have moved more than two . miles away since Charlie vanished and Mrs Haigh was only back in . Stubbington to view a property for her mother. She said: 'My mum, sister and I were looking at a place close to the house Ade and I lived in when Charlie went missing. Off again? Mrs Haigh says she is scared to let Charlie out of the house in case he runs away again . 'If it wasn’t for the bungalow my mum, sister and I were looking at, we wouldn’t have been around there. 'When we saw this cat on a wall outside a house I was immediately 99.9 per cent sure it was Charlie. 'He was a lot skinnier but came straight over to me and responded to his name. 'We went and spoke to the man who lived there and he told me he had been feeding Charlie for about two and a half years. 'I’m over the moon to have him back. We shed a few tears when the microchip test worked.' Mrs Haigh, a receptionist, says she’s so happy to have Charlie, now 16, back that she’s scared to let him out of the house. She added: 'I was shocked to start with that I had even come across him. 'We had always been left wondering what had happened to him. Since you've been gone: Jo and Ade Haigh have moved house and had twins since the 16-year-old cat went missing in 2006 . 'When he went missing we did all the usual things like going out looking for him, posting leaflets and contacting vets, but there was nothing. 'Charlie had always been quite a friendly cat. When we lived in Stubbington he would often go down to the nearby stables where they would feed him. 'So it’s no surprise he found someone to look after him in the intervening years.' A lot has changed in the household since Charlie disappeared in 2006. Engineer Mr Haigh, 38, and Mrs Haigh now have 13 month old twins, Drew and Daniella. They already had two other cats and two dogs, which Charlie has been reintroduced to after being found last Thursday. Returned: Charlie was identified when Mrs Haigh checked his microchip tag . He is eating well and using his litter tray, but hasn’t met their new cat and dog, Mrs Haigh said. She added: 'Charlie seems quite content and is slowly getting back into life here. 'We haven’t let him out again so far. We will eventually, but I don’t know when I’ll be brave enough. 'He’s got the meow of an older cat now and you can tell he’s grown up into an older boy.

The SS United States was the last of the golden age of trans-Atlantic cruise ships, 107 feet longer than the Titanic and 50 percent faster than the ill-fated luxury liner. From its maiden voyage in 1952, the SS United States operated for 17 glorious years and the massive ship still holds the prestigious Blue Riband - for the fastest trans-Atlantic crossing by a passenger liner. Although never in active naval service, the ship played a vital role in the Cuban Missile Crisis and became a symbol of American power during the Cold War. Now slowly rusting away in a south Philadelphia mooring, the ship which was known as the unofficial flagship of the nation is now at the heart of ambitious redevelopment plans to restore it to its former glory and convert it to a floating hotel. Scroll Down for Video . Reinvention: The rusting hulk of the SS United States is at the heart of ambitious plans to redevelop the ship and turn it into a floating hotel like the Queen Mary in California . Disrepair: The boat operated for 17 years and played a crucial role in the Cold War . Saved from a date with the scrap yard in February of last year, a local philanthropist's $5.8 million gift allowed the SS United States Conservancy to buy it and keep it afloat until November 2012. With that date looming, the nonprofit conservancy has launched a 'Save the United States' drive to mark the 50th anniversary of her launch and her claiming of the Blue Riband. The conservancy has raised about $6 million so far but needs $25 million to restore the exterior and part of the interior to house a museum, restaurants and a hotel said Susan Gibbs, conservancy executive director and the granddaughter of William Francis Gibbs, the ship's Philadelphia-born designer. The goal is to spark interest, raise public awareness and literally get investors on board. 'The SS United States is America's . flagship. It symbolizes the very best that this nation has produced,' she said. 'It is going to once again be an amazing icon for the nation . to appreciate and enjoy.' Window of opportunity: Cable TV mogul H.F. 'Gerry' Lenfest saved the ship from the scrapheap with a $5.8million donation . Ravaged: Moored in Philadelphia, the SS United States is now owned by the nonprofit SS United States Conservancy . The fundraising campaign includes a new interactive website, which allows donors to 'purchase' a piece of the ship for $1 per square inch for themselves or in honor of someone else. They can choose the section they want to sponsor by scrolling and zooming around a virtual model on the website, 'meet' other donors throughout the ship, personalize and upload images andmemories of the ship, and share it through social media sites. “This is living history. Once this ship is gone, it will never be replaced. It is the last of the American ocean liners. It was built in Newport News. We cannot lose this ship,” said Dan McSweeney who is on the SS United States Conservancy and a commercial developer. The 990-foot-long ocean liner, which . transported patrons across the Atlantic with both elegance and muscle, . has spent the bulk of its life in a nomadic existence plagued by . shifting owners, dashed hopes and close calls with the scrap yard. Haunting: Shown is an enclosed walkway on the once-glamorous cruise ship SS United States in Philadelphia . But even in its humbled state, the ship newspapers once feted as 'the greatest shipbuilding effort in the history of this country' and 'the most revolutionary modern superliner in the world' still remains an awe-inspiring sight even to those who remember it from its heyday. 'The engineering, the beauty, the service, the safety - this was the best, the best in the world, none of the ships could compare with it,' Joe Rota, who worked on the ship in the 1950s, said during a recent visit aboard the United States. 'And it would be an absolute tragedy to lose it.' The $5.8 million donation from cable TV mogul H.F. 'Gerry' Lenfest, whose naval architect father designed parts of the SS United States, saved the ship from a likely scrapping and allowed the conservancy to buy the ship from Norwegian Cruise Lines in February 2011 and pay for 20 months of docking and related costs. The conservancy's redevelopment arm is exploring potential partnerships with entities inPhiladelphia, New York and Miami to refashion the vessel as a stationary entertainment complex with a hotel, theater, restaurants and shopping but the clock is winding down along with the money from Lenfest's gift. Shown is an rusted and ruined interior view of the SS United States . 'The three areas that have expressed an interest in this are Miami, New York, and greater Philadelphia. However, we recently heard from a group that is very preliminarily interested in looking at the ship in Norfolk,' said Dan McSweeney, commercial developer. 'What you see here is kind of discouraging but ... you could scrape this down and you could repaint it, and when we light the lights at night on occasion she's absolutely gorgeous again,' said Rota . 'And we could have that again. ... This would be an attraction the whole world would want to come and take part in again.' Commissioned as a joint venture between the Navy and ship designer Gibbs & Cox, the $78 million liner's luxury cloaked its military might. Though never called to battle, it could have been converted in a single day to transport 14,000 troops for 10,000 miles without refueling. The once-great liner is still the holder of the Blue Riband for the fastest trans-Atlantic crossing which it set in July of 1952 . Instead it carried more than 1 million passengers across the Atlantic over the course of 400 round trips, among them President John F. Kennedy, Marlon Brando, Elizabeth Taylor, Salvador Dali, Grace Kelly and Prince Rainier of Monaco, and England's King Edward VIII. In 1968, Bill Clinton traveled tourist-class en route to Oxford University. The liner's glory days were short-lived as air travel rose in popularity, however, and the United States was taken out of service in 1969. It changed hands multiple times, from the Navy and on through a series of restoration-minded investors. It was unceremoniously towed from Virginia to Turkey to Ukraine, finally arriving in Philadelphia as a gutted hulk. Another succession of developers and a cruise line failed to return the ship to service as retrofitting costs proved too great. The ship is still the only man-made object within America to bear the name United States . 'It's been 60 years since I first set foot on this ship with my mother ... it's very exciting,' said Louise Meiere Dunn, 82, of Stamford, Conn., who stood recently on the promenade where she danced the conga on the maiden voyage, when the United States set a new trans-Atlantic record from New York to England: 3 days, 10 hours, 40 minutes. The record that still stands for a conventional passenger ocean liner. 'We understood there was going to be some sort of celebration when we were going to break the record,' Dunn said. 'We went out on deck ... but the weather was so foul we came back here and found it on the promenade deck.' RMS Queen Mary now operates as a hotel in Long Beach, California . She recalled with a laugh that she and the other young people on board partied until breakfast, which they ate while still in their evening gowns and black tie from the night before. Several weeks later, a friend in India saw her dancing the conga on a movie newsreel. 'I'm hoping that this ship can be revived, repurposed,' she said. 'It would be wonderful to see this promenade deck being used again - and having a conga line, maybe.'","The SS United States is rusting away in a Philadelphia mooring .

Diplomatic security for the U.S. mission in Benghazi was 'a struggle' and security teams in Libya were drawn down ahead of last month's fatal attack, the former head of a U.S. security team in Libya told lawmakers on Wednesday. 'Diplomatic security remained weak. In April there was only one U.S. diplomatic security agent stationed there,' Lieutenant Colonel Andrew Wood told the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee during Congress' first hearing on the assault that killed U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. 'The situation remained uncertain and reports from some Libyans indicated it was getting worse. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Explanations: Charlene Lamb, the diplomatic security deputy who said that she declined to approve more U.S. security as violence in Benghazi spiked, said the department wanted to train Libyans to protect the consulate . Difficult: Lt. Col. Andrew Wood was in charge of the security at the Libyan consulate for the six months before the attack, and said that it was always 'a struggle' due to cuts in security forces . 'The security in Benghazi was a struggle and remained a struggle throughout my time there.' Wood said that when he arrived in Libya in February there were three U.S. diplomatic special security teams in the country, but by August they had been withdrawn. He served as the Site Security Team commander in Libya for six months prior to the attack. Woods said he came forward to the congressional committee after Stevens and the three other Americans were killed in the assault. 'The killing of a U.S. ambassador is a rare and extraordinary thing and requires our attention as a people,' he said. 'As a citizen I made the determination that this outweighs all other interests and will risk whatever circumstances may result from my testimony.' In a day filled with official testimonials, another revelation came from a top diplomatic security deputy who said that she declined to approve more U.S. security as violence in Benghazi spiked, saying the department wanted to train Libyans to protect the consulate. Attack: The violence at the U.S. embassy on September 11 caused the deaths of the American ambassador Chris Stevens and three other American personnel . 'I made the best decisions I could with the information I had,' said Charlene R. Lamb, a deputy assistant secretary for diplomatic security. Partisan tension quickly spilled out at the hearing, with Republicans accusing the State Department of not being fully cooperative in providing information on security decisions before the attack. Democrats accused the majority Republicans of conducting a one-sided probe that excluded them. Republican charges that the United States was caught unprepared for the September 11 attack have put the administration of President Barack Obama, a Democrat, on the defensive ahead of the November 6 presidential election. Republicans continued their line of attack that the administration initially issued misleading comments saying the assault was a spontaneous event that sprang from a protest against an anti-Islam video. Altered accounts: Ambassador Patrick Kennedy testified on behalf of the State Department, saying that initially after the attack, intelligence pointed to the belief that it was due to the anti-Muslim video . Taking it in: Rep. Darrell Issa (right) and Rep. Elijah Cummings (left) confer during the hearing where they were told that now intelligence confirms that it was a planned terrorist attack . Administration officials said those initial comments, including by U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice, resulted from the best information at that time. 'The information she had at that point from the intelligence community is the same that I had at that point,' testified Patrick Kennedy, the under secretary of state for management. However, Reuters reported last week that within hours of the attack, the Obama administration received about a dozen intelligence reports suggesting militants connected to al Qaeda were involved. Insufficient: Ms Lamb said that the safe haven area within the compound was not strong enough to keep out the dozens of armed attackers . White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters Wednesday that in hindsight 'there is no question that the security was not enough to prevent that tragedy from happening. There were four Americans killed.' Democrats on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee tried to blame Republicans for cutting more than $300 million in diplomatic security funds worldwide. 'The fact is that, since 2011, the House has cut embassy security by hundreds of millions of dollars below the amounts requested by the president,' said Maryland Representative Elijah Cummings, the committee's senior Democrat. Eric Nordstrom, who was the top security official in Libya earlier this year, testified he was criticized for seeking more security. 'There was no plan and it was hoped it would get better,' he said. Nordstrom told the committee that conversations he had with people in Washington led him to believe that it was 'abundantly clear we were not going to get resources until the aftermath of an incident.

France's first woman justice minister today called for the 'quadruple, triple' sex lives of the nation's male politicians to be exposed. Rachida Dati, 46, was speaking out after what she described as 'shameful' revelations about the romantic life of the country's first lady, Valerie Trierweiler, 47. This week it emerged that Ms Trierweiler was once the shared mistress of future Socialist president Francois Hollande, and conservative minister Patrick Devedjian, a right-wing conservative. Not only was Ms Trierweiler married at the time, but so was Mr Devedjian, and Mr Hollande was living with the mother of his four children. Now Ms Dati, whose own colourful romantic history was frequently raised when she was justice minister between 2007 and 2009, said high-profile women involved in adulterous affairs were treated unfairly. 'I think it's shameful what's done and what's been written about Valerie Trierweiler,' she told Europe 1 radio station. 'Why not disclose the quadruple, triple lives of certain politicians, of some bosses who do not behave well with women or who sometimes behave in a manner which is very loose?' Ms Dati, who is single, last month launched legal proceedings to make a casino tycoon acknowledge he is the father of her love child. Dominique Desseigne, the 68-year-old chief of the Lucien Barriere group, received a demand for 'recognition of paternity' for her daughter Zohra, born on January 2, 2009. When Ms Dati pregnant in 2008, there was intense speculation as to who the father was, with suspicion even falling on then president, Nicolas Sarkozy, and Jose Maria Anzar, the former Spanish prime minister. Others who figured in the frenzied guessing game, including Mr Desseigne, avoided the issue in interviews. Miss Dati went on to cause a stir by . giving birth by caesarean section and returning to work five days later . in time for the announcement of a major justice reform. The MEP and mayor of Paris's chic 7th . arrondissement initially said claims she had filed the paternity . proceedings were 'false' before launching into a diatribe against the . media for violating her private life. Scandal: Earlier this week it emerged that Valerie Trierweiler was the mistress of her partner Francois Hollande, left, and conservative minister Patrick Devedjian, right, at the same time . Ms Trierweiler has issued legal proceedings against two leading French reporters over the revelations about her life, despite the fact that she is a Paris Match magazine reporter. Issuing her fourth privacy writ since becoming first lady in May, Ms Trierweiler said she was planning to sue the authors of the book for breaking France's strict privacy laws, and for defamation. There was no specific denial of any of the allegations contained in a new book, La Frondeuse (The Troublemaker), but her barrister Frederique Giffard instead said it was a collection of 'author assertions backed by unproven rumours', all aimed at 'maliciously tarnishing' Ms Trierweiler and her family. Mr Devedjian is also suing, but Mr Hollande will not be taking legal action over the book.","Rachida Dati called the revelations about Valerie Trierweiler 'shameful'

President Barack Obama has admitted that giving the green light to the raid that killed Osama bin Laden was 'a flip of the coin' decision. The president revealed he was only 50 per cent confident that the man spotted by the C.I.A. living in an Abbottabad compound was the world's most wanted terrorist, according to a new book that weaves together accounts from Obama and top decision-makers on the events leading up to the daring operation and it's aftermath. 'This is 50–50,' Obama said, silencing the small group of senior officials gathered in the situation room. 'This is a flip of the coin. You guys, I can't base this decision on the notion that we have any greater certainty than that.' Crucial meetings: President Barack Obama, pictured left, discussed the raid with his team of security advisers on May 1 2011 . Published in part in the latest Vanity Fair, Mark Bowden's eye-opening book reveals how the head of the C.I.A.'s bin Laden team was only 60 per cent sure the terrorist was living in the Pakistan property. Michael Morell said the evidence to suggest that Saddam Hussein was hoarding weapons of mass destruction, which later turned out not to be the case, was 'much stronger' than the intelligence on bin Laden's whereabouts. Morell had been personally involved in the flawed analysis of Saddam's weapons capability. 'I'm telling you, the case for W.M.D. wasn't just stronger — it was much stronger,' he said. But Obama decided to press ahead. Nail-biting events: The president sat with vice president Joe Biden, and secretary of state Hillary Clinton to watch the mission against Osama bin Laden in the Situation Room . 'One of the things you learn as president is you're always dealing with probabilities,' he told Mr Bowden. 'No issue comes to my desk that is . perfectly solvable. No issue comes to my desk where there’s 100 per cent . confidence that this is the right thing to do. 'Because if people were . absolutely certain then it would have been decided by someone else. 'In this situation, what you started getting was probabilities that disguised uncertainty as opposed to actually providing you with more useful information.' The only major dissenter to the plan was Joe Biden, the book says. 'Mr President, my suggestion is: don't go,' the vice president said, believing that a failed attack would scupper any chance of a second term. Navy Seals: The U.S. Navy SEALs, pictured during a training course, were chosen to conduct the raid on the compound last year . 'We have to do two more things to see if he's there.' Despite coming to terms with the . 50/50 per cent probability that the so-called 'Pacer' who teams had been . monitoring as he walked around the compound's grounds, was bin Laden, . Obama said he couldn't help churning the details over in his mind the . night before the raid. 'It was a matter of taking one last . breath and just making sure, asking is there something that I haven’t . thought of?' Obama said. 'Is there something that we need to do?... At that point my estimation was that we weren't going to be able to do it better a month or two months or three months from now. 'We weren’t going to have better certainty about whether bin Laden was there, and so it was just a matter of pulling the trigger.' The book explains that a courier initially led the C.I.A. to the compound where they discovered three families living together in the large property, which was out of place for the area. In hiding: This undated image from video seized from the walled compound of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan . The identity of the third family, however, was a mystery. The most important clue was the figure who came to be known as The Pacer, a man in traditional Pakistani attire and prayer cap who regularly took walks around the vegetable garden. Agents took photos and video footage of the man as he paced the grounds. They also counted the pieces of laundry that were hung out to dry to determine the size of the hidden family. The number of wives and children corresponded with the number of family members they believed might be living with bin Laden. The C.I.A. then got mission commander admiral Bill McRaven on board, and the elite group of Navy Seals did two separate practice runs on American soil before the nail-biting May 2011 raid, which ended the life of the al Qaeda leader.","New book reveals Obama believed there was a 50/50 chance the man spotted by the C.I.A. in Pakistan was Osama bin Laden .

A political debate turned physical in California yesterday as one of the two Democratic candidates for congress grabbed the other by the shoulder, challenging him to a fight. Brad Sherman and Howard Berman were mid-debate when Mr Sherman suddenly grabbed his opponent and shouted: ‘You want to get into this?’ The heated moment came during a debate at a college in Woodland Hills, San Fernando Valley, as the pair stepped up their . game in the competition for a Los Angeles seat. Opponents: Congressmen Brad Sherman, left, and Howard Berman, right, . debate at a Senior Center in California the day before the 'fight' A video of the tussle was released on Howard Berman’s YouTube account by his campaign manager, accompanied with a press release headlined ‘Has Brad Sherman lost his mind?’, which led to the opposing side accusing them of a smear campaign. What the video does not show is that moments earlier, during a dispute on an immigration-related bill, Mr Berman, 71, the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, had called Mr Sherman ‘delusional’ and ‘liar’. Congressman Berman, seen on the left in the video, then stepped close to Mr Sherman, 57, on the stage, who told his colleague loudly, ‘Get out of my face.’ A few seconds later in Mr Sherman is seen taking a hold of Mr Berman in front of an increasingly riled audience. The two men later stood nose-to-nose . exchanging words before a sheriff's deputy emerged behind them and . briefly placed his hand on Sherman's shoulder after which the pair . separated. Firestarter: The debate between the congressmen get heated as the pair square up against each other . At the close of . the debate, held at Pierce College, Woodland Hills, Berman said: ‘We are in a heated and expensive race. It's . become a very emotional race. 'We [each] think that when smears are made, . and when untruths are said, a person has to defend himself and that . raises the intensity of debate.’ The . move by Howard Berman’s team to release the video is . just the latest stunt in an increasingly nasty campaign for congress. It . has seen a series of competing accusations, ranging from suggestions of . ethical impropriety to fleecing taxpayers. Earlier Thursday, two former . secretaries of state, George Shultz and Madeleine Albright, released a . letter defending Berman for taking overseas trips following criticism . from Sherman's campaign. In response to the video, Parke . Skelton, Mr Sherman's campaign manager, refuted the claims that Congressman . Sherman attacked his opponent. ‘Sherman . did not challenge Berman. Congressman Sherman was reacting to Berman leaving . his table, coming over to where Sherman's was seated and calling him a . ""liar"" and ""delusional."" 'Mr Skelton said that Congressman Sherman asked . his opponent to step away and the grab was a result of Mr Berman . refusing to do so.’ 'You want to get into this?': Congressman Sherman puts his arm around his opponents shoulder and shouts in his face . Release: The woman grabs Mr Sherman's arm and he lets go of Congressman Berman's shoulder . He . added: ‘Clearly the context is that Sherman is upset that Berman has . come over to where Sherman was and is getting in his face and calling . him names. Sherman is asking Berman why he is behaving the way he is.’ Mr Skelton also accuses Congressman Berman’s campaign manager Brandon Hall of turning the exchange ‘into something it was not.' ‘Brandon's release makes a number of . misstatements and exaggerations. Sherman did not put Berman in a . headlock. A Sheriff did not escort Sherman from the premises. Both . parties calmed down and the debate continued.’ ‘Not a good day for a consultant when you have to deny that your candidate put someone in a headlock. ‘ . Get a load of this guy: Mr Sherman continues to attack with a raised voice having let go of Mr Berman . Head to head: The pair go against each other once more on stage . Two ways: An officer and the moderator go between them and the pair separate . Mr . Sherman himself said in a statement that the debate ‘was not conducted . at the highest level.' He said: 'I regret my part in allowing emotions to distract . from the exchange of views.’ The veteran lawmakers were pulled into the same district after a voter-approved independent panel redrew California's political boundaries. They were the top vote-getters in the June primary and went on to the general election because of California's new primary system, which sends the top two finishers to the runoff regardless of party affiliation. Their race for the 30th district seat is one of eight same-party congressional runoffs on California's November ballot. Another, in the San Francisco Bay area, involves Democratic Rep.

A survivor of the horrific parking garage collapse on a South Florida college campus has spoken out about his ordeal, throwing himself from the stricken construction as it fell to the ground, killing four and injuring eight. Anthony Williams described the moment the building gave way on Wednesday as sounding 'like an earthquake, like someone put a stick of dynamite in it.' 'I was thinking of my mom and my 9-year-old daughter,' the 27-year-old labourer told CBS. 'Right now, I am really shook up and terrified. I still have nightmare and dreams. I can still feel the building shaking.' Scroll down for video . Disaster: A parking garage under construction at a Miami-Dade College campus collapsed today killing three workers and trapping at least one other in the rubble . Help: Rescue workers attend to a construction worker injured in the collapse that did not hurt any students . Williams had only begun work at the Miami-Dade College site on the day of the accident. He leapt from the second floor in a . desperate move that saved his life, but others weren't so lucky. The . bodies of three dead workers have been removed, with a fourth remaining . trapped inside. Although the missing man's death will . not be confirmed until his remains are found, officials are calling . their search for him a 'recovery mission' rather than one of rescue. 'I remember coming back after my lunch break and seeing a crack in the building on the 5th floor,' Williams continued. 'That was just ten minutes before . this crash happened. I told someone about it. I heard a crash and saw . the building was going down. I jumped from the 2nd floor and it saved my . life. 'I did that to get away, it was my only chance, otherwise I'd get caught and it would have been the end of my life. 'Right now my body is really sore. I . jumped from that high a place. My legs and my toes hurt and my back . hurts. I don't think I'll ever work in a garage again.' As the injured recover in hospital and families of the deceased grieve . their loss, attorneys are considering lawsuits pending the results of an . investigation into what happened to cause the fatal accident. Devastation: Witnesses say workers ran screaming from the garage as it fell around noon on Wednesday . Fallen: In a photo provided by Miami-Dade Fire Rescue, emergency workers remove an injured man from the rubble . 'We don't know the cause, but we're going to find out,' Robert . Rubenstein told the neews channel. 'We're concerned for the families. Until we get information from OSHA and the investigation is complete, we . won't know whose fault this is. 'A lot of people died in this tragedy. This is a tragedy that should not have happened.' Addressing the media on Friday, Bill . Byrne, CEO of the construction company behind the work, Ajax Building . Corp, confirmed that a crane had bumped a column early in the week. 'It is my understanding that there was an incident where the crane bumped a column,' he said. 'It didn't cause any damage to the . column. The crane was repaired and inspected and it was rectified and . the engineer looked at the column and deemed that it was perfectly . safe.' But as Williams has since asked: 'If they knew that the crane hit the building, why would they send us out there?' Tragedy: Fire Rescue officials work to remove a victim from the collapsed parking garage . Emergency: Miami-Dade Fire Rescue, firefighters load a victim into an ambulance from Kendall Medical Center . Brave: A witness to the terrifying scene said the five-story garage fell like 'a house of cards' Teams are continue to probe the site, . searching for the final worker, electrician Robert Buhdoo. But the . man's family say they are distressed at how long his recovery is taking, . adding that they have not given up hope of him being found alive. 'I'm tired of being quiet, taking . whatever they give me,' Tasha Bagwandeen, Buhdoo's daughter said. 'I'm . not going to do that. I need answers and I need them now. 'It's not fair. My dad is laying . there somewhere hanging on for dear life. And they're taking their own . little time saying he's not alive. They have no proof. He needs somebody . to rescue him.' The third construction worker died on . Wednesday, after rescuers were forced to amputate his legs following 13 . hours trapped under tons of concrete when the five-floor garage . collapsed. Samuel Perez, 53, was pronounced dead soon after being flown to a Miami trauma center around midnight for surgery. Rescuers . could hear his cries soon after the building collapsed - and once they . located him in the cabin of a truck, they had to amputate his legs above . the knees at the scene. The two other fatalities have been identified as Carlos Hurtado Demendoza, 48, and Jose Calderon, 60. Family's fear: Two family members of a construction worker are seen speaking with a police officer near the collapsed parking garage on Thursday morning . Relief: Three workers are seated on a green blanket to recover and await examination by medics . Reporters and horrified onlookers who were kept . across the street from the collapsed garage could see Perez being . carried on a stretcher from the rubble to an awaiting ambulance and then . driven away. He was accompanied by two physicians who had been treating him with and IV and oxygen during the hours he was trapped. The . worker was located by rescuers who heard his cries from amid the rubble . not long after the roof of the five-story garage fell, creating a . pancake-style collapse. A third man was pulled out alive from the rubble and brought to a hospital shortly after the collapse on Wednesday. A . video shot by Miami-Dade Fire-Rescue showed four firefighters pulling . him out from under a steel beam. His face and hands were bloody and he . was put on a stretcher and carried away. Seven workers were brought to the hospital with unidentified injuries while an eighth was treated on the scene and sent home. No students were in the area at the time. The campus was evacuated and closed for the rest of the week. Investigators are now planning to pick through the rubble to see what caused the garage to crumble. 'We just know that the roof collapsed,' said Miami-Dade Fire-Rescue spokeswoman Griselle . Marino. Ruin: Rescue teams picked their way through concrete, metal and plywood rubble to find survivors .

As hundreds of soldiers prepared to take to the field clutching spears and swords, it was perhaps no surprise that health and safety bosses might have something to say. But it was the rain, rather than the weapons, that meant a re-enactment of the Battle of Hastings was cancelled yesterday. Some 1,066 people dressed as Norman and Saxon warriors were expected to stage their own version of the famous battle at what is thought to be the original site in Sussex. But history fans were left disappointed after heavy downpours on Saturday meant organiser English Heritage was forced to cancel the event for ‘safety reasons’. Walking wounded: A re-enactor helps a comrade away from the fighting. Every year history enthusiasts recreate the Battle of Hastings, a huge turning point in British history . Fog of war: One thousand and sixty six Saxon and Norman soldiers from re-enactment groups across Europe aimed to faithfully recreate the Battle of Hastings in 1066 . A spokesman for English Heritage said: ‘Although the forecast was for fair weather over this weekend, unexpected torrential rain over several hours this morning has resulted in unacceptably high levels of mud both on the battlefield and on public areas. For safety reasons, the event cannot go ahead.’ Kevin Boorman, of Hastings Borough Council, said: ‘It is understandable but it is a real shame because the organisers put a lot of time and money into organising and advertising it.’ The council had held a week-long festival of events, culminating in the re-enactment weekend, since the battle’s 900th anniversary in 1966. While the battle was cancelled, events on Saturday including a town criers’ contest and firework display, went ahead. Calm before the storm: Warriors take a break from the 'fighting'. Harold II was killed in the battle, the last English king to die in battle on English soil until Richard III was killed at the Battle of Bosworth Field . Battle fatigue: Members of historical re-enactment groups prepare to assume the role of Norman soldiers for the annual re-enactment of the Battle of Hastings at Battle Abbey . There you go, dear: A woman hands a warrior his sword. The Battle of Hastings was the last successful invasion of Britain . The Battle of Hastings took place on October 14 1066 between the Norman-French army of Duke William II of Normandy and the English army under King Harold II. Harold II was killed - legend has it that he was shot in the eye with an arrow - and was the last English king to die in battle on English soil until Richard III was killed at the Battle of Bosworth Field. The battle was a decisive victory for William, who became England's first Norman ruler. Echoes of history: Re-enactors strive to be as historically accurate as possible, even down to the food they eat . Cosy: A soldier takes a break. Even accommodation is as authentic as possible . Stoic: Like their real-life counterparts, the re-enactors have to lug their heavy weapons and armour around the battlefield . The battle is depicted in the Bayeux Tapestry, which also chronicled the events leading up to the Norman conquest of England. An abbey was built on the site of the battle after Pope Alexander II ordered the Normans to do penance for killing so many people during their occupation. Camp: Soldiers travelled with cooks, armourers and a host of other supporters . Feeding time: Even young history enthusiasts can get in on the action at the annual event .

His final journey on a Southwestern coach, one of the first coaches at the Bluebell Railway, followed a lifetime devoted to railways. He held numerous roles, including as a manager with the Southern and British Railways. He chaired the first meeting of the Bluebell Railway Preservation Society after British Rail closed the Lewes-East Grinstead route in 1958. Latterly, he became the society’s president.

Bernard Holden (centre) at Sheffield Park station in a line-up of the guards' department . Dubbed the 'founding father' of the Bluebell Railway, Mr Holden saw it steadily expand to what it has become today - a preserved steam railway attraction which draws 170,000 visitors a year. He was born in the station house at Barcombe in 1908 and his father Charles was the stationmaster. He worked at Southern Railway in 1925 as a ballast train clerk and studied signalling and transport law. During the war he controlled trains bringing home evacuees from Dunkirk and plotted routes for trains round the bomb craters during the Blitz. Full steam ahead: Bluebell Railway spokeswoman Avril Gaynor said: 'The Bluebell Railway wouldn't be here if it wasn't for Bernard.' Mr Holden’s long-held dream of seeing . the Bluebell line reconnected with the main line at East Grinstead, West . Sussex, is set to come to fruition next year . The coffin carrying Mr Holden . travelled nine miles on the Bluebell Railway following his death on October 4 aged . 104 . The Bluebell Railway now has a turnover of more than £3 million, full-time staff, 700 volunteers, three Victorian stations and a collection of locomotives, carriages and wagons. Mr Holden’s long-held dream of seeing the Bluebell line reconnected with the main line at East Grinstead, West Sussex, is set to come to fruition next year. Ms Gaynor said: 'Our only sadness is that he didn’t see us going into East Grinstead.' The final journey was being followed by a funeral service at Ditchling. Donations which will go towards the line extension can be made to the Bluebell Railway at Sheffield Park. The Lewes and East Grinstead Railway Act, 1877, which was promoted by the Earl of Sheffield and other local landowners, authorised the construction of a railway between the towns, and the 1878 Act provided for the acquisition, completion and running of the new line by the London Brighton and South Coast Company. Of the sites chosen for the six stations, only one, Barcombe, was close to an existing village. Of the other five, all of which were in thinly populated areas, two were in the parish of Chailey and were placed near the homes of the line's promoters. The line was opened in 1882 and carried passengers and goods, including milk, farm produce, coal and timber. British Railways submitted a proposal to close the line in 1954, but this was hotly contested by local residents. The closure was approved in February 1955 and became effective from May 28th 1955. But this sparked a four year battle between British Railways and the users of the line and that's when it became known as the Bluebell Line.  In 1877 local resident Miss Bessemer discovered that the 1878 Act had a clause and immediately requested British Railways to honour their obligation. It was re-opened on 7th August 1956 and British Railways were severely criticised following a public inquiry. However, Parliament then repealed the special section of the Act which had caused the problems and the line was finally closed on March 17 1958. It was later taken over by the Bluebell Railway Preservation Society and re-opened on August 7 1960. It was the first . preserved standard gauge steam-operated passenger railway in the world . to operate a public service. The Bluebell Railway is now a heritage . line running for nine miles along the border between East and West . Sussex. Steam trains are operated between Sheffield Park and Kingscote, . with an intermediate station at Horsted Keynes. It is managed and run largely by . volunteers and has more than 30 steam locomotives the largest number in . the UK after the National Railway Museum. Work to extend the line by two miles to allow trains to go to East Grinstead began more than three years ago and thousands of tonnes of household waste had to be removed from part of . the line at Imberhorne cutting at a cost of £2m, as it had been used as a . landfill site. The project has cost more than £4m in total.","The Lewes and East Grinstead Railway, as it was first known, opened in 1882 but closed in 1958 .

President Obama is set to launch an all-out assault on Mitt Romney in Tuesday night's debate, including attacks on the republican's time at Bain Capital. He is desperate to pick up momentum and improve poll ratings after his first lackluster first debate when his Republican rival appeared more forceful, energetic and engaging than the President. And his campaign spokeswoman has hinted that Obama will use Mr Romney's track record as an investment capitalist to hurt him. 'Governor Romney has been making pitches all of his life,' Jennifer Psaki said. 'He . knows how to say what people want to hear whether that was during his . time at Bain or during the dozens of town halls he did during the . primary,' she added, referring to the private equity firm that Romney . used to run. Scroll down for video . Talking to the people: President Obama stopped in to his campaign office in Williamsburg, Virginia on Sunday since he was nearby studying for the upcoming debate . Support: Mr Obama's advisers said that he was planning on appearing more energetic during Tuesday's upcoming debate . Not once during the first debate in . Denver did the President mention Romney's time at Bain, even though he . and his campaign have frequently attacked the work throughout the . campaign. A similar hint came from senior Obama campaign advisor David Axelrod, who gave a clear hint that Romney's business experience may be used as a double-edged sword. 'We expect Governor Romney will have a great debate too,' Axelrod said during an appearance on Fox News Sunday. 'He is a great salesman. That is what he did as a professional, he is very good at it.' He said that President Obama was definitely going to be 'aggressive in making the case for his view of where we should go as a country.' After being roundly criticized for his performance in the last debate, Mr Obama is apparently well aware that a change needs to be made. Down to business: Romney, seen with his wife Ann, spent the weekend in their Massachusetts home preparing for the debate Tuesday night . Sticking to the schedule: Mitt and Ann Romney were seen leaving their Church Sunday morning . 'He knew when he walked off that stage (of the first debate), and he also knew as he watched the tape of that debate, that he has to be more energetic,' campaign adviser Robert Gibbs said to CNN's State of the Union. Both Obama and Romney are skipping campaigning Sunday to focus . on preparing for their debate Tuesday night, with the incumbent trying . to rebound from a widely panned performance at the first face-off and . the Republican nominee hoping to repeat his strong showing. Senator Rob Portman, who has been playing the role of the President during Romney's debate prep, said that they are taking a shift in energy levels into account. 'I think President Obama is going to come out swinging,' Portman told ABC's This Week. 'He's going to compensate for a poor first debate. And I think that will be consistent with what they've been doing this whole campaign, which is running a highly negative ad campaign. They've spent hundreds of millions around the country, including a lot in Ohio, mischaracterizing Governor Romney's positions and misrepresenting him. I think you'll see that again on Tuesday night.' The president was gathering with . advisers at a riverfront resort in Williamsburg while Romney was . sticking to his Boston-area home ahead of the prime-time town-hall style . debate at Hoftsra University exactly three weeks before the November 6 . election. Prepping: The president was gathering with advisers at a riverfront resort in Williamsburg, Virginia . Staying local: Romney was sticking to his Boston-area home ahead of the prime-time town-hall style debate . After a listless . first debate October 3, Obama was working with aides on more pointed and . aggressive responses to his Republican rival in the tight race. The . Obama campaign also wants to go after the former Massachusetts governor . and businessman for what it sees as his willingness to shift positions . to make them more palatable for voters. Romney will be ready for a more aggressive Obama, adviser Ed Gillespie said. 'The president can change his style, . he can change his tactics, he can't change his record and he can't . change his policies. And that's what this election is about,' Gillespie . told CNN's State of the Union. Romney's . campaign released a new television advertisement using footage from . running mate Paul Ryan's debate last week with Vice President Joe Biden. Round one: Romney was deemed the winner of the first debate as the President was criticized for being too quiet and seemingly uninterested . Sparring: Thursday saw the first and only vice presidential debate between Romney's running mate Paul Ryan (left) and Vice President Joe Biden (right) The ad features clips of Ryan saying . the government 'can't keep spending money we don't have.' His comments . are juxtaposed with video from the debate of Biden laughing. The campaign did not say in which states the ad would run. Obama aides have tried to make debate preparations a higher priority for the president this time. Ahead . of first debate, some of Obama's practice sessions were cut short, and . others were canceled, mainly because of developments in Libya, where . four Americans were killed at a U.S. consulate. Aides . say Obama is still dealing with those matters and others. But the . urgency that led to interruptions during earlier debate preparations has . subsided, and the campaign is trying to ensure that Obama stays more . fully engaged in his practice sessions. Despite questions about the effectiveness of his debate preparation, Obama is working with the same team this time around. Advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe, along with former White House officials Anita Dunn and Ron Klain, are running the preparations. Deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes has been added to the team because the second and third debates involve foreign policy. Senator John Kerry is playing the role of Romney. One of the priorities during the practice sessions is sharpening the president's retorts to Romney and drawing a sharper contrast between what the campaign says are Romney's shifting positions on key issues. Taking to the streets: The pressure is now on Mr Romney, seen here with a crowd in Lebanon, Ohio on Saturday, for him to repeat the energetic and victorious performance that he had in the last debate . Greeting the fans: President Obama's decision to take days off from campaigning shows how serious he intends to focus on preparation for the second debate . The president may have picked up a few pointers from Biden. Obama watched Thursday's debate with aides in a conference room on Air Force One as he traveled back to Washington. The president said little throughout the debate, but did chime in when Biden would deliver a particularly pointed counter to Ryan. Romney returned to Massachusetts on Saturday night after campaigning in Ohio. He planned to spend most of his two days at home in Belmont getting ready for the debate. With Romney is Ohio Senator Rob Portman, who's playing Obama in mock debates.","President Obama and Mitt Romney both take time off from campaign trail to prepare for town hall-style debate on Tuesday .

Experts today claimed a group of wallabies have been living wild in the British countryside for 60 years after one was spotted darting in front of a taxi. Driver Tomas Tarjan, 32, was taking a group of girls home in the middle of the night when he spotted the animal hopping across the road. He said: 'This is the weirdest thing I . have seen. I said to the girls I was sure we did not live in Australia. We spent 40 to 50 minutes searching for the animal. Unexpected: The wallaby was snapped by astonished Jessica Wiltshire, 20, one of the passengers in the taxi . Unlikely habitat: The village of Barton, Cambridgeshire, where the wild wallaby was spotted . 'As I had my hazards on, several taxis stopped. When I said we were looking for a kangaroo they just asked me if I was alright. 'The girls in the back seat called . the police - they sent two cars and when they saw the picture we had . taken they started searching.' Jessica was stunned when the wallaby hopped across the road in the Cambridgeshire countryside as she went home after a night out . Jessica Wiltshire, 20, one of the passengers in the taxi, said she thought it was hilarious and managed to snap a picture of the marsupial, usually found in the Australian outback. She said: 'I quickly got my phone out and took a picture of it because I thought no-one was going to believe me.' Police officers eventually caught the animal in the early hours of Sunday morning but were told by experts to let it go - as it had probably spent all its life in the wild. Astonishingly, the marsupial is believed to be descended from a group of wallabies which escaped from Whipsnade Zoo, Bedfordshire, in the 1950s. Experts believe the resourceful group have managed to survive off shrubs and vegetation and even breed despite the harsh British winters. Animal officers yesterday said they planned to leave the wallaby and any of its relatives free to roam in the wild where they have made their home. Members of the public have been warned to leave the animals to their own devices if spotted out in the countryside. A spokeswoman for Shepreth Wildlife park said it probably descended from wallabies which escaped from Whipsnade Zoo 60 years ago. She said: 'It could be a private collector that lost one or it could be one of these ones that has decided to make its way across country. 'They will live on foliage and berries so there is plenty of food for them out there so they have nothing to worry about. 'It’s not the sort of thing a fox would go for - they have got quite a kick on them.' A spokesman for Cambridgeshire police said they had located the creature and contacted wallaby owners in the area but no-one reported theirs missing. But the RSPCA and Shepreth Wildlife park advised them to leave the animal where it was because it is likely to be wild.

The CEO of Citigroup today quit his post unexpectedly but insisted the move was of his own accord, and that now was the ‘right time’ to do it. In an exclusive interview with CNBC’s Maria Bartiromo, the 55-year-old said that while the transition to a new CEO may be abrupt, he also added: ‘It makes no sense for the old CEO to look over his shoulder.’ Pandit's sudden departure was made all the more dramatic by another announcement that the company's COO John Havens was also departing. Scroll down for video . Bowing out: Citigroup CEO Vikram Pandit, left, is stepping down as CEO and a board member, effective immediately, as well as COO John Havens, right; a source says they were outed because of poor performance . Cutting their losses: Citigroup's stock performance, pictured in red, has fallen a staggering 89.7 percent since the 2008 banking crisis . Speaking to CNBC, Pandit said that . his departure was not because of money, citing four years ago during the . financial crisis where he accepted a token salary of just $1. However, Bartiromo hypothesized that . Pandit’s words could ring less than true, pointing out that as a hedge . fund manager, he made hundreds of millions of dollars, and could not . have been happy with his nominal salary. According to reports, Pandit was paid some $15million as Citi’s CEO last year. Taking the helm: New company CEO Michael Corbat takes Pandit's place . In addition, source told Bloomberg News that Pandit . had poorly handled several transactions, which in turn damaged the . company. The source said that Citigroup’s directors had talked of . letting Pandit go months ago. And a second top executive also resigned . as part of the shake-up: President and Chief Operating Officer John . Havens, who also serves as CEO of Citi's Institutional Client Group. The company’s chairman, Michael E. O’Neill was apparently frustrated with the former CEO’s performance. According to the source, that irritation with Pandit led to his being . fired. He was awarded more than $15million in his 2011 compensation, but more than half of shareholders voted against it. The pay issue was thought to still be a source of friction internally, according to Reuters. A representative for Citigroup did not immediately respond to MailOnline’s request for comment. Pandit was known for steering the . bank through 2008 financial crisis and the choppy years that followed. But within minutes of the bank's announcement, Pandit's name was gone . from Citigroup's website. His . replacement as CEO is Michael Corbat, the current CEO of Citigroup's . Europe, Middle East and Africa division, the bank said. The change is effective immediately. The bank offered no explanation for the sudden departure of its two top executives. Corbat has worked at Citigroup and its predecessors since he graduated from Harvard in 1983, it said. Pandit will also relinquish his seat on Citi's board of directors. Citigroup's stock tumbled 2.5 percent in premarket trading following news of Pandit's departure, but later the shares were up 20 cents to $36.86 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Investors questioned why Pandit would leave now after keeping the bank afloat during the financial crisis and getting it back on a firmer footing. On the rise: As of this afternoon, the stocks were up by a little more than one percent . Rise and fall: Citigroup's stock tumbled 2.5 percent in premarket trading following news of Pandit's departure, but later the shares were up 20 cents to $36.86 in early trading on NYSE . Shaky: Pandit faced criticism after Citigroup took $45billion in government bailout money in the 2008 credit crisis, but managed to steer the company through (file photo) 'I would have expected he wanted to stay around and see some of the fruits of his labors there,' Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer of Oakbrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois, told Reuters. Pandit's resignation comes after a series of high-profile defeats this year. In March the Federal Reserve rejected the bank's capital plans after a stress test; Pandit had led analysts and investors to believe the dividend-raising plans would be approved. Last month, Pandit agreed to a low sale price for his bank's stake in the brokerage operated by Morgan Stanley. Citigroup had to take a $4.7billion charge in the third quarter to write down the value of that stake. Citigroup shares rose sharply on Monday after the bank reported third-quarter results that were much better than analysts expected. Thanks to the dedication and sacrifice of people across Citigroup, we have emerged from the financial crisis as a strong institution. Citigroup is well-positioned for continued profitability and growth, having refocused the franchise on the basics of banking. Given the progress we have made in the last few years, I have concluded that now is the right time for someone else to take the helm at Citigroup. I could not be leaving the Company in better hands. Mike is the right person to tackle the difficult challenges ahead, with a 29-year record of achievement and leadership at this Company. I will truly miss the wonderful people throughout this organization. But I know that together with Mike they will continue to build on the progress we have made. -Vikram Pandit . The one-two punch of the results and then Pandit's exit point to what analysts say has been a years-long unsettled atmosphere around the bank. Pandit, 55, said in a statement that 'now is the right time for someone else to take the helm at Citigroup' after the bank 'emerged from the financial crisis as a strong institution.' Pandit joined Citigroup in 2007 when the hedge fund he founded was acquired by the bank. He quickly rose to CEO in December 2007. Earlier, he had ascended to head of investment banking at Morgan Stanley before leaving in 2005 to form the hedge fund. According to Forbes, the naturalised citizen lives on Manhattan’s Upper West Side with his wife, Swati, and his two children, Maya and Rahul. His salary last year – including bonuses and awards – totalled at $14.85million. Born in Nagpur, India, the 55-year-old Pandit obtained two electrical engineering degrees and a doctorate in finance from Columbia University, having started his education at the Ivy League school at the tender age of 16. He earned a doctorate in finance in 1986. Pandit joined Citigroup in July 2007 when the bank acquired his hedge fund and private equity firm, Old Lane Partners LP, for $800million. Citigroup had to shut down Old Lane the next summer, an early black mark for the executive. Family man: Vikram Pandit and wife, Swati, at the Royal College of Art in London this past summer; the couple has two children . New era: Pandit, 55, said in a statement that 'now is the right time for someone else to take the helm at Citigroup' after the bank 'emerged from the financial crisis as a strong institution' Critics later charged that Pandit was too timid, perhaps even too academic, to run a big consumer bank. His successor, Corbat, has held a number of senior roles at Citigroup, including running Citi Holdings, the unit established to house businesses and assets the company wants to shed. A fixed income salesman by training, Corbat started out at Solomon Brothers in 1983. More recently, he has been credited with successfully restructuring some of Citigroup's consumer and credit card units. Pandit faced harsh criticism after Citigroup took $45billion in government bailout money in the 2008 credit crisis. It is widely believed that other, stronger banks were forced to take billions in bailout money to divert attention from Citigroup, whose financial situation was more precarious.

Snail mail: Your letters may take longer to arrive under a new systee being considered by Ofcom . First class post could be axed under proposals published yesterday by the industry regulator. Ofcom is considering scrapping the two-tier system of first and second class post which has been in place for more than 40 years. Instead they may be merged into one service which would see a letter taking two days to arrive, according to proposals set out yesterday. At present, it costs 60p for a first class stamp for a letter to arrive the next working day, and 50p for second class which should arrive within three working days. But Ofcom says it is thinking of replacing this system with one in which a stamp costs around 53p and letters take two days to arrive. It said: ‘The benefits of a next day service would appear to be diminishing over time as the use of other communication methods can fulfil the need for speed.’ The proposals follow a survey, described by Ofcom as the largest-ever poll of users of the postal service about what they need from the Royal Mail. The report concludes that ‘a significant proportion of first class mail does not actually need to arrive the next day’, adding that it is ‘expensive’ to provide the current service. Ofcom said the most popular option – backed by 59 per cent of users – was the alternative one-price system, rather than the current two-tiered option. Its 144-page report also considered stopping postmen from having to deliver post through people’s letterboxes. Instead, post could be left in a ‘secure locker’ in a train station or village hall, or placed in ‘a secure weatherproof box’ at the edge of a property, according to the report. But Ofcom said the majority of people surveyed were ‘strongly against’ this idea. Ofcom also considered the idea of cutting the number of deliveries per week. At present, Royal Mail is legally bound . to pick up and deliver letters six days a week for the same price – . known as the ‘universal service’. But the report suggests that changing this is unlikely, stating: ‘The Government has indicated it has no intention to change at present.’ Robert Hammond, director of postal policy at Consumer Focus, said its own research found many people were ‘happy’ with the idea of just a single class of post. But he added: ‘A premium product that guarantees a next day delivery must remain an option for special circumstances.’ Billy Hayes, general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, said: ‘We want to see innovation, not cuts, in order to improve service standards.’ A Department for Business spokesman said: ‘The minimum requirements of the universal service, such as the six-day letters service, cannot be changed by Ofcom. ‘Those requirements can only be changed by Parliament.’ But Ofcom has the power to merge first and second class post into one service. Its proposals are subject to a public consultation, which closes on December 18. It  must publish its decision by March 31, 2013.","Regulator Ofcom is considering scrapping two-tier system .

Frances Harden, 31, fell foul of anti truancy laws after teenager Harrison Thorpe was taken out of classes for 11 days so he could walk his mother down the aisle. She had arranged to marry Nick Harden, 34, in an £8,000 ceremony at a four star hotel in St Lucia in 2011 in the belief the event would be taking place during this year's Easter holidays. Scroll down to hear from Frances . Defeat: Mr and Mrs Harden outside Stockport Magistrates' Court where she was ordered to pay £280 for taking her son Harrison out of school . But the dates for the 2012 Easter holidays were two weeks earlier than the year before - and when Mrs Harden realised her mistake, Dr Rose Hegan, headmistress at Marple Hall School in Stockport, Greater Manchester, refused to grant permission to take Harrison out of school. Mrs Harden took him anyway and yesterday pleased guilty under Section 444 of the 1996 Education Act after refusing to pay the £50 fixed penalty. Fining her £100 plus £165 . prosecution costs and a £15 victim surcharge, chair of the bench, . magistrate Alf Storey said: 'Whilst we note that Harrison's general . attendance was good, the time off was taken during school term and . started after a two week holiday period.

Bride: Frances White with her husband Nick Harden and her sons Harrison (centre right) and Alex at her wedding in St Lucia . Absent without leave: Harrison walks his mother down the aisle during the Caribbean ceremony . A frustrated Mrs Harden accused schools of .

She had even filed a Freedom of Information request . asking Stockport Council to reveal the number of pupils being allowed . time off during term time since 2010. And after yesterday's hearing, Mrs Harden admitted she intended to continue her fight. Mrs Harden, a care assistant, said: 'I feel so relieved it's over but the issue still remains. 'I do think the whole decision . surrounding holidays and time off from school should be made by an . independent person, as opposed to the Headteacher because there are so . many grey areas.

'I think the whole process needs to . be looked at, so I'm going to write a letter to the relevant body. It's . ridiculous because what one person deems a special circumstance may . not be to another. It needs to be consistent throughout school and . boroughs. 'Harrison's education was not . affected by the time off - he's actually gone up two sets in English and . computing since. He's a great pupil and loves school. 'I can understand procedures being in . place for kids playing truant and families who find it difficult to . engage their kids into education, but this wasn't the case in this . circumstance - and that is proved by Harrison's attendance records and . grades.' Mrs Harden nee White and her long . time partner Nick, a 34-year old project manager booked the . Caribbean wedding after being together for 12 years. Harrison is her son . from a previous relationship. She told the JPs: 'This was not just a . holiday - this was our wedding that we had planned.

I emailed again and it took three phone calls before I finally . spoke to the head mistress - on the 5 or 6 of March she eventually . called me. I asked if this could be requested off. 'I explained that this was our wedding and it was a special circumstance but she stated that it was not going to be authorised.' Mrs Harden also brought with her to court school reports and attendance records which showed Harrison was a good student. She added: 'He had no time off school . - we haven't requested any time off school since he started.

Cast and sculpted in clear acrylic, they were designed to represent not only those they depict – but to maintain public awareness that lives and limbs are still being lost. And that thousands are still having to rebuild shattered careers after sometimes devastating injuries. Soon the statues will embark on separate tours of Britain, visiting the victims’ local communities, military establishments, schools and museums. The idea is to raise awareness of the sacrifices Britain’s servicemen and women make. Or, as sniper victim Simon Brown put it yesterday: ‘It’s just another way of saying: “Look, we’re normal guys, people from your town”.’ Awareness: Each of the 20 figures depicts a soldier wounded in battle in Afganistan, Iraq, Kosovo or Bosnia . 'It's a way of saying 'look, we're normal guys"": REME mechanic Simon Brown, 33, lost most of his sight when he was shot in the face in Iraq in 2006 . REME (Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers) mechanic Simon, 33, from Leeds, was shot in the face during his second tour of Iraq in 2006. He was hit while rescuing six colleagues under fire in what he described as ‘a turkey shoot’ after their vehicle broke down and stranded them. The rifle bullet went through his left cheekbone and out the other side of his face. He survived by shoving his thumb up to the palette of his mouth to stop himself choking to death on his blood, then stemming the bleeding while keeping his jawbone together. His mates survived because he hitched his truck to their vehicle and towed them to safety. The bullet destroyed Simon's left eye . and permanently damaged his right, leaving him with only 19 per cent . vision. Standing beside his statue yesterday he told me: 'Take a look at . the guys with missing limbs, who still have smiles on their faces, and . you realise your life isn’t that bad. If you can let people know they’re . appreciated, and give them a lift, it’s pretty special to them.' Poignant: Duncan Moyse amongst the statues . 'It's a way of underlining what an extreme war Afghanistan is': Ben Deakin, left, and Dan Richards, right, stand by their cut-outs . Hope: Alexandria Elia walks between the likenesses of battle casualties . Proud: Karl Hinett and Mark Lanchberry brave the elements . Former Royal Marine Commando Ben Deakin, . 26, was shot in the ankle five years ago while serving in Afghanistan. He and two colleagues on a rooftop came under heavy fire from inside a . Taliban compound. His quick-thinking almost certainly saved their lives. 'They were badly wounded and covered in blood', he said, 'I didn’t realise I'd been shot at the time so I helped them. I say helped – I just pushed them off the roof into cover. They probably didn’t think I was helping at the time.' The statue of Ben, an ex-lance corporal, is likely to be going at some stage to his former barracks at  40 Commando in Taunton. 'With the amount of injuries and the amount of lads who won’t be returning, it’s a way of underlining what an extreme war Afghanistan is', he said. The Help for Heroes initiative is being sponsored by Bell's, which began its association with the armed forces by sending Scotch Whisky to troops in the First World War. It hopes to raise £1m for the charity through public donations linked to the statues, created by sculptor Stuart Murdoch. Help for Heroes co-founder Bryn Parry . stood alongside the statues and their subjects yesterday and said: 'A . lot of these people have left the services but their battle injuries are . going to be with them for life. There’s a real danger that when we . start moving out of Afghanistan and we no longer have repatriation . ceremonies, people will heave a sigh of relief and say the war’s over.

Banks may have tightened their lending criteria in recent years but they'd be bending over backwards to loan money to Tom Pavelka. The Cleveland government worker has the highest credit rating in the entire United States, despite owning eight credit cards and having an outstanding mortgage on his 3,000-square-foot home. Pavelka, 56, has a credit score of 848 out of 850 and a letter he received from the credit bureau recently announced his rating 'ranks higher than 100 per cent of U.S. consumers.' Most credit-worth: Cleveland government worker Tom Pavelka, pictured, has the highest credit rating in the entire United States . But the man, who has no children and lives with his wife of 25 years, Helga, in Westlake, insists he isn't tight with his cash, he's just responsible. 'I don't like being called frugal,' he told told The Plain Dealer. 'I like to spend money. I just do it wisely.' 1. Get a credit card if you don't have one. Having and using a credit card will build your score. 2. Pay down your credit cards. Try to . get your balances below 30 per cent of the limit on each card or, even . better, below 10 per cent. 3. Pay your bills on time. Set up automatic payments and be sure to have enough money in your account to avoid overdraft fees. 4. Use your cards lightly. Racking up . big balances can hurt your score, regardless of whether you pay your . bills in full each month. 5. Avoid late payments, charge-offs or . collections and if you have any errors in your credit report dispute . them with the credit bureaus because they can really cost you. Pavelka, an assistant district director at the Department of Labor's Office of Workers' Compensation in Cleveland, owns two 1960s British sports cars, a 1958 Corvette and four other vehicles. But he and his wife carpool 16 miles to work so he doesn't have to pay for parking or rack up miles on another car. The couple eat out regularly and collect vintage red wine but they holiday in the U.S. While his score isn't perfect, it's the most impressive most financial experts have ever encountered. 'I don't know anybody who has a perfect credit score,' Experian director of public education Rod Griffin told The Plain Dealer. 'It's almost impossible. If you use credit and you have debt, there's always some risk you will not be able to repay it. 'You could become ill, you could be . in an accident that's not your fault. Because there's always some risk . from things beyond your control that you won't be able to repay the . debt, you won't have a perfect credit score.' To get a high credit score, you need to take on debt to show you can responsibly pay it off. Pavelka has a mortgage with four years left on it and an equity line that he generally uses to buy cars and then pays off. The couple also have a total of eight credit cards with available credit exceeding $120,000. He admits having no kids probably helped him get to credit score royalty. Likes to spend: Tom Pavelka owns seven cars including a 1958 Corvette, similar to the one above, but says he spends his money wisely . But he also swears by a few simple rules including never spending money without knowing when he can pay it back and paying his bills on time. Pavelka said he has never obsessed about his credit score, and can't remember the last time he checked it or what it was back then. He only learned of his near-perfect rating after being lured to sign up for a store credit card at hunting store Bass Pro Shop because it would knock $50 off his purchase. Two weeks later he got a letter revealing his enviable credit score.

Not the job in hand: The Missile Defence Agency workers should have been developing rockets like this SM-3 rather than looking at pornography . The Pentagon has ordered staff at its top-secret missile defence unit to stop watching porn and concentrate on the job in hand. Military chiefs are furious that workers at the Missile Defence Agency have been wasting valuable hours surfing the web for smut rather than developing state-of-the-art weaponry. The violation came to light after fears were raised that viruses may have already been smuggled into the department's mainframe through x-rated sites. An internal probe then found that some staff had been downloading adult material on office computers and sharing them with each other via the internal network. It constitutes a massive security risk to one of America's most secretive agencies because porn sites provide perfect cover for criminals and foreign spies to sneak snooping software past even the most sophisticated of firewalls. In a bid to curb the abuse, the agency's executive director sent a stern memo warning staff that 'appropriate disciplinary action' would be dished out to anyone caught surfing the net for smut. 'There have been instances of employees and . contractors accessing websites, or transmitting messages, . containing pornographic or sexually explicit images,' John James Jr . wrote in the July 27 memo leaked to Bloomberg News. 'These actions are not only . unprofessional, they reflect time taken away from designated duties, are . in clear violation of federal and DoD and regulations, consume network . resources and can compromise the security of the network though the . introduction of malware or malicious code, he wrote.'

One government cybersecurity expert, who wished to remain anonymous, said criminal gangs and foreign intelligence agencies, such as Russia, embed spyware deep within the coding of pornographic websites in a bid to access and harvest confidential data from governments and corporations.

A teenager is being chased by debt collectors for a £9,000 medical bill after she rushed her friend to hospital during a holiday in Greece. Laura Surtees, 18, desperately called an ambulance for her friend who was suffering from a severe asthma attack during their summer holiday in Malia, Crete. But Miss Surtees was burdened with the huge medical bill when she unintentionally signed a form in Greek agreeing to pay the costs - unaware they had been taken to a private hospital. Laura Surtees, 18, pictured with her mother Lisa, is in a 'terrible state' over the £9,000 bill . Laura, from East Herrington, Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, said: ‘I was in such a state. I was terrified for my friend. ‘She looked in a really bad way. I just wanted to help her. ‘I was given forms to fill in, but I thought I was just giving my consent for the operation. ‘Some bits of them were in a foreign language. ‘It turned out I was taking responsibility for paying for it. ‘It was such a huge shock when I was got home and found out about the bill. ‘I’ve no hope of finding that kind of money. My family don’t have it and my friend doesn’t have it.’ The part-time shop worker fears the debt will stop her from going to university to train as a nurse. Laura said: ‘I was hoping to study nursing at university next year, but I don’t know if this is going to put an end to that. The Creta InterClinic Hospital in Crete said the bill remains unpaid and a debt collection company are investigating . ‘I don’t know if I’ll be able to arrange funding or a student loan or if I’ll be somehow blacklisted because I’ve got this debt on my record.’ Laura has been forced to consult solicitors in a final bid to negotiate with the hospital, as the insurance policy does not cover the treatment. Laura’s mum Lisa, 42, said her daughter has struggled to come to terms with the legal wrangle after returning home from the seven-day holiday in July this year. The maternity nurse said: ‘We’ve tried pretty much everything. ‘We’ve spoken to solicitors, but because the incident happened overseas they told us they would find it difficult to deal with the laws in another country. ‘The result is we’d have to pay solicitors in Greece, which we just can’t afford. ‘Laura is in a terrible state. She is so worried about it. The whole holiday was ruined, but she didn’t expect to face this when she got back home. ‘She wasn’t even allowed to stay at the hospital with her friend.’ A spokeswoman for the Creta InterClinic Hospital confirmed that a ‘hospitalisation bill’ remained unpaid and that a debt collection company was investigating the case. She said: ‘No deposits have been made and the case is with our legal department for further management. ‘The reports of the legal department also do not show any progression of the case.’","Laura Surtees signed forms in Greek unaware she was in a private hospital and agreeing to pay her friend's bill .

Once a friend has been 'demoted', you see fewer of their posts in your news feed - but they'll never know of their new, lower status. The 'acquaintances' list has been around since last year - but the new tool makes it easier to demote friends, by suggesting 'victims' from your Friends list .

The tool works like a negative version of the 'suggested Friends' the site occasionally offers. When you visit your Acquaintances list (next to your Friends list) a new option pops up - 'See All Suggestions'. The friends on the list are people who Facebook suggests might belong among your acquaintances instead. Coens is keen to emphasise that the victims will never know what's happened.

Twilight world: Hollywood studios should be forced to add condoms to sex scenes to make teenagers have safe sex, a researcher has said . Hollywood studios should be forced to add condoms to sex scenes to make teenagers have safe sex, a researcher has said. Teenagers often use sex scenes in films as a 'script' for their real-life sex - but Hollywood films tend to portray condoms as comical. A researcher found that watching screen sex led teenagers to use condoms less - and called for regulation. ‘One important observation from our evaluation of the films was that few showed contraceptive use or safe sexual practices,’ researcher Ross O’Hara from the . University of Missouri said. ‘When safe sex is portrayed in films, it is often in comedies and is presented as an inconvenience or embarrassment. 'The motion picture industry could make an effort to show healthier, safer behaviors, just as they have reduced the amount of smoking shown in films.’ Watching sex scenes in movies can make children more sexually active from a younger age, research suggests. Watching sex on screen also makes teenagers less likely to use condoms, said O'Hara. Around 84% of current Hollywood films contain sex - including series aimed at teenagers such as the Twilight films. Take more risks: Watching sex on screen can influence a child's personality and make them more prone to take risks . The scenes can 'fundamentally influence a teenager's personality’ and make them more prone to take risks he said. Dr . O'Hara said: ‘Adolescents who are exposed to more sexual content in . movies start having sex at younger ages, have more sexual partners and . are less likely to use condoms with casual sexual partners. While there’s been much research into the influence of drinking and smoking in movies, sex scenes has been overlooked. Dr O’Hara said: ‘Much research has shown that adolescents’ sexual attitudes and behaviours are influenced by media. 'Sexual scripts': Teenagers look to films to work out how to behave in complex situations and don't differentiate between what's on the screen and daily life . A survey of movies from 1950-2006 found that 84 per cent of movies contain sexual content. Sexual content was found in: . ‘But the role of movies has been somewhat neglected, despite other findings that movies are more influential than TV or music.’ Psychologists studied children aged 12 to 14 and then reviewed their sexual behaviour six years on. The research, published in Psychological Science, followed 1,228 children over the six year period. Dr O’Hara said adolescents often have . a predisposition for ‘sensation seeking’ behaviour, which peaks between . the ages of ten and 15, and leads to a tendency to seek more novel . and intense stimulation of all kinds. His . team found that greater exposure to sexual content in movies at a young . age actually led to a higher peak in sensation seeking during . adolescence. The sensation . seeking behaviour could last well into the late teens and early . twenties if young people were exposed to movie sex scenes Dr O’Hara . said. He said: ‘These . movies appear to fundamentally influence their personality through . changes in sensation seeking, which has far reaching implications for . all of their risk taking behaviours.’ Teenagers . could also learn ‘sexual scripts’ from the films, using them as . examples of how to behave when confronted with complex emotional . situations. Restricted viewing: While movies like Titanic seem harmless, with scenes like this one between Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet, parents must restrict their children's viewing . Given that for . 57 per cent of American adolescents between the ages of 14 and 16, the . media is their greatest source of sexual information, they often don’t . differentiate between what they see on the screen and what they must . confront in daily life, Dr O’Hara said. The researchers also looked at 684 . high grossing films and analysed them for sexual content, such as heavy . kissing or actual sex. Most of the recent films did not portray safe sex, with little mention of using contraception. Each teenager identified which movies they had seen from a list of 50, randomly selected. Six . years later the teenagers were surveyed to find out how old they were . when they became sexually active and how risky their sexual behaviour . might have been. They were also asked if they used condoms consistently and whether they had multiple sexual partners. The findings revealed the link between exposure to sex on screen and sexual behaviour. Dr . O'Hara said: ‘This study, and its confluence with other work, strongly . suggests that parents need to restrict their children from seeing sexual . content in movies at young ages.’","Hollywood films tend to show condoms as 'comical'

At first glance, they look uncannily like a gallery of moody, hipster black and white pictures uploaded to the retro photo sharing site instagram. In fact, they are a collection of 'raw' images from Nasa's Curiosity rover on the surface of Mars. The unprocessed images have a grainy quality, due to the 'hidden' colour information within them - which is not revealed until they are processed by Nasa. A 'raw' image from the Martian surface taken by the mastcam, a 2 megapixel camera on curiosity's mast. It may look like a mono image, but in fact has colour information encoded within it, giving it a grainy quality rather like an instagram picture . The same image, but processed to reveal the colour. Online enthusiasts were able to extract the colour information from the raw image. The image can then be processed to alter its colour and make it look more presentable. Here, a final image has been created showing the martian landscape in colour. Each Mastcam uses a filtered  camera sensor to capture images. Known as a Bayer Pattern Filter CCD, it provides nearly true color views - that is, similar to what the human eye would see on Mars. Using this approach eliminates the usual need for planetary spacecraft cameras to take 3 separate images - one through a red filter, one through a green filter, and one through a blue filter. The CCD captures the image using the pattern below: . While Nasa only generally publicises . 'hero' images that show off stunning new features or amazing colour . panoramas, it has also quietly been publishing every single image from . the rover's multiple cameras online, giving a far more accurate view of . the red planet - which, it seems, it actually a rather dull place - . until the colour information is extracted. Although Nasa does not publish details of how it encodes the images, online enthusiasts at unmannedspaceflight.com have worked it out, and are busy decoding images. These images are taken by Curiosity mastcams, and are usually used by engineers and drivers on Earth to check the rover is going in the right direction. Roberty . Massey of the Royal Astronomical Society explains that many of the . images we see from Mars use false colours to highlight key areas. 'True colour images are fairly rare, . and as anyone who has looked at Mars through a telescope knows, it is an . orangey red colour,' he said. 'However, there really isn't a huge . diversity of colour there - and it really resembles a barren desert, and . a very harsh environment' They are also used to look for potential sites for the rover to investigate. One of the two Mastcam camera systems . has a moderate-resolution lens, while the other camera system has a . high-resolution lens in order to study the landscape far from the rover. In fact, even Curiosity's high resolution camera is poor compared to modern cameras and even phones. A two megapixel unit, it was chosen to permit Curiosity to store and transmit images in good time. Curiosity . sends data to two satellites currently orbiting Mars -- the former Mars . Reconnaissance and Mars Odyssey orbiters -- which then transmit data . back to Earth. But at a speed of only 128Kbps, it's still quite slow in modern terms - and explains the grainy, retro pictures sent back. As well as the retro images, Curiosity also sends back small 'thumbnail' images, often in basic, unencoded colour, which show engineers what the camera is focused on before they decide whether to take a higher resolution photo. A thumbnail images showing a closeup of a rock on Mars . The low res images (shown here at their full size) are used to check camera positions .

The images also reveal fascinating rocks on the martian surface, including this triangular one dubbed 'shark rock' The images, all taken from Curiosity's mastcam, are used by engineers to study the rover's surroundings as it moves around the red planet. Nasa provides no information about images, but does claim to publish every single picture from the red planet of a special curiosity images feed. The low resolution pictures have a grainy quality probably caused by martian dust, and slight distortion at the edges due to the relatively low quality lenses on the rover. The images reveal the sweeping beauty of the Martian surface, but also help controllers look for possible areas for Curiosity to go and visit.","Images are from Nasa's 'live feed' of every raw image taken by Curiosity .

The Federal Bureau of Investigation had been the centre of a major privacy row after cyber experts from The AntiSec hacking group released more than a million Apple device IDs - allegedly taken from an agent's laptop.

The group claimed the information - which included 12 million IDs, known as Unique Device Identifiers, as well as personal information such as user names, . device names, notification tokens, cell phone numbers and addresses - enabled the Government to spy on the users. The FBI immediately denied it was the source - but many refused to believe it was anything other than affirmation of their Orwellian nightmares.

Paul DeHart, CEO of the Blue Toad, . which provides app building services to 6,000 users and serves . 100million page views a month, told NBC News technicians had matched . the hacked information with their own private data. He said: 'That's 100 percent confidence level, it's our data.' He added: 'As soon as we found out we . were involved and victimised, we approached the appropriate law . enforcement officials, and we began to take steps to come forward, clear . the record and take responsibility for this.' AntiSec last week released a million of unique IDs online - but removed the most personal data.

When Codemasters got behind the wheel of the F1 licence two years ago, they created one of the finest racing simulations ever made in F1 2010. Its successor, F1 2011, was also strong, although minor aesthetic updates and marginal multiplayer modifications left many fans wanting more. Graphical showcase: The game is vibrant and looks stunning in motion . Thankfully, it’s clear F1 2012 is not just a simple update. Rather, it's a complete overhaul, with accessibility now just as important as simulation. The engine room powering this new focus is the Young Driver Test – which you’re thrown into almost immediately, before having had a chance to admire the game’s new menu screens. Here, you are taught how to drive a F1 car, from using KERS and DRS, to hitting the apex and accelerating away from a corner. It’s a smart, casual introduction that bodes well for those new to the genre. However, some challenges lack that extra level of instruction, resulting in a trial-and-error feel quickly developing. Once you feel confident enough, there are plenty of different modes on offer. In Champions Mode you go up against six F1 champions currently racing in the 2012 season in quickfire scenarios. These range from trying to keep behind Lewis Hamilton in the rain with the wrong tyres, to reining in Sebastian Vettel at Hockenheim while trying to get the fastest lap of the race. Race is on: Tactics are more important than ever in F1 2012 . For players after arcade-style thrills, Season Challenge allows you to pick a rival and race to try and beat him. Keep on doing so and you’ll soon win a new contract to a better team. You'll also be awarded a score at the end of the season. It’s a welcome lightweight addition to the simulation-heavy franchise, adding a more causal element to gameplay while not intruding on the hardcore career mode. It is here where authenticity takes precedent. Where the most minor of tweaks to tyres, brake balance and suspension prove as much a deciding factor to a race victory as the driver itself. F1 2012’s career mode is dauntingly realistic. The improved suspension system and downforce mechanic affects the handling substantially, and the cars feel weightier than in the 2011 game. Cars are noticeably more twitchy to handle and require much more delicate touches to meander successfully around hairpin corners. Whereas F1 2011 encouraged the player to attack corners head-on and at speed, the razor-sharp and totally unforgiving responsiveness to even the slightest stick movement results in a much more tactical experience. Eye of the storm: The game successfully captures the 'feel' of driving an F1 car . When you get it right, it’s incredibly rewarding – the aerodynamic grip is illustrated brilliantly, presenting the player with plenty of feedback. This realism update also applies to the racing rules, which have all been tweaked. However, penalties for cutting corners, for example – although giving you time to position back – are extremely erratic in their implementation. That being said, racing is brilliantly executed. There has been a move away from the rather grey palette of first two outings, with vibrant colours and stunning car models on show throughout. Lighting has been improved, too. There’s also that fantastic sensation of speed F1 fans have come to expect from the series – perfectly capturing the drama and white-knuckle thrills of a race. F1 2012 is a game that appeals to new fans while staying true to what hardcore gamers know and love. It’s a fantastic package that looks and feels like the real thing.

We are not going to visit Mars anytime in the next decade or two - so the next best thing is to bring some of the Red Planet back to us. So Nasa is now looking for ways to bring Martian rock and soil back to Earth, allowing scientists to study the soil composition for the first time and investigate for signs of if the planet ever had life. The Mars Program Planning Group is putting together different ways of returning a sample within the next 20 years, with Nasa potentially choosing which path to follow by next February. One option involves 'multiple launches', a Mars Ascent Vehicle which will fire rock and soil into space, from which it can be collected and sent back to Earth. Scroll down for video . Return to Earth: A small satellite in Mars orbit holding soil samples ready for collection . Missions to Mars can only take place every 26 months or so, when the planets are properly aligned, and one suggestion is that a 'blast soil into space and scoop it up' mission could be staggered over separate launches. Another option is to perform the mission in one shot - but that will put a lot of costs onto Nasa in a small amount of time, and might just be too costly for the space organisation. Orlando Figueroa, team leader of the Mars Program Planning Group, said :'[All the options] have their pluses and minuses. Samples loaded: Capsules could be blasted into Mars orbit, and await pick up . 'It gives you multiple ways to look at this problem, consistent with budget concerns, consistent with opportunities for collaboration, more technology, et cetera. 'And that's what we tried to do - bring all of those options forth to NASA for consideration.' Another suggestion is that multiple Curiosity-style rovers are sent to Mars, checking out many different sites. Then Nasa can cherry-pick the best samples, probably just from one location, and send them back. This has the benefit of increasing the chances of finding signs of life during such an expensive project.

"By . Sophie Borland . UPDATED: . 04:14 EST, 15 December 2011 . Obesity is also more common in towns and cities than rural areas, according to newly-released data . One child in three is overweight when they leave primary school at the age of 11, alarming figures reveal. Almost a fifth are classed as obese, meaning they are so fat they risk knocking years off their lives. And the number of ten and 11-year-olds who fall into this category has risen by nearly 10 per cent in just four years, according to NHS data. In some towns and boroughs, more than a quarter of children this age are obese. Experts warn that many of these youngsters will stay fat for the rest of their lives, putting them at greater risk of heart disease, diabetes and other serious illnesses. The figures show 33.4 per cent of children in Year 6, the final year of primary school, are overweight or obese. This is up from 31.6 per cent in 2006/7, the first year when the data was collected. But there is mounting concern that the Government is not doing enough to tackle the nation’s weight problem. Earlier this year Health Secretary Andrew Lansley’s 54-page obesity strategy was condemned as ‘woefully inadequate’ by medical experts. Labour public health spokesman Diane Abbott said: ‘The entire strategy can, shockingly, be summed up in two words: eat less.’ Tracy Parker, dietician  at the British Heart Foundation, warned: ‘Obese children are more likely to become obese adults. And obesity in adults is associated with an increased risk of type two diabetes and heart disease.’ The figures come from more than a million children who are part of the National Child Measurement Program, which records their weight and height in the first and last years of primary school. Based on this information it is possible to calculate their Body Mass Index, which is an estimate of their body fat. Children are classified as obese if their BMI is high for their age. There is a slightly different limit for each age group above which a child would be considered obese.","NHS data reveals 19 per cent of Year 6 children obese .

The youngster from Nottingham developed a fear of eating and drinking and had to be fed by a stomach tube after refusing meals. Now thanks to pioneering treatment by specialists in Austria, Daniel can sit down and eat a meal with his family. Progress: Daniel has now managed to eat two months after taking his first drink at the University Hospital in Graz. His father says he loves biscuits . Daniel in hospital with a feeding tube. He now eats meals though some have to be pureed as he has difficulty chewing . Daniel’s father, Kevin Harrison, 43, said: 'Seeing my little boy able to eat is like winning the Premier League, the European Championships and the World Cup all at once. 'We still have to puree some of his main meals because chewing can be difficult as he hasn’t developed the muscles in his mouth properly. 'He can eat everything we eat - and he loves chocolate and biscuits. 'I am the proudest father in the world - this means the world to me and makes me feel like I’ve finally done my job as a parent.' Daniel was taken to a University Hospital in Graz, Austria by his parents, Kevin and Catherine, where medics used techniques not practised in the UK to make the youngster realise he both needs and wants food. They used a variety of in-house methods to persuade Daniel to become more familiar with food and have fewer worries about putting it into his mouth. The treatment has been practised on around 12 people from across the world - all of whom have been successfully cured, and are now able to eat. Success: Daniel with his proud parents Kevin and Catherine. They have spent tens of thousands of pounds to encourage him to eat . Specialists in Austria used techniques to make Daniel realise he needed food . It is the second time that the family have visited the treatment centre after they returned two months ago once Daniel had successfully managed to start drinking - another action he wasn’t been able to do since birth. Kevin said: 'When we saw Daniel drink for the first time, it was an incredible feeling. Now seeing him eat, we just can’t believe our luck. Catherine and I just cried and cried. 'Eating has changed him as a child - his behaviour has changed and he’s so much happier. He’s a different boy. 'He’s costing us a fortune in food now because we want to get him to try new things but it’s so worth it.' Daniel suffered painful acid reflux as a baby . Kevin and letting manager Catherine, 39, were initially turned down funding by their local Public Health Trust (PCT) because they both worked. Despite some funding for this second trip due to their previous success, the couple have been financially crippled by the treatment they have fought for to help their son. The family has spent almost £25,000 to try and encourage Daniel to eat. Kevin said: 'We would have liked to stay in Austria until Daniel could eat and drink but the strong financial ties meant we had to take two separate trips. 'We have had to make huge sacrifices to be able to afford the treatment, and it has cost us a fortune. 'But, this has allowed our son to become self-sufficient and able to survive as an adult and you can’t put a price on that.' Daniel was fed through a tube into . his stomach for four years because the memory of the painful acid reflex . he suffered during breastfeeding was too strong. Daniel was taught during his first trip to Austria to drink through a specially designed water bottle, which contained a milk formula which provided him with all the key nutrients he needed. But, throughout Daniel’s short life, his parents have faced a constant daily struggle to find a way to help their son eat and drink. The youngster had no interest in food as he doesn’t understand its purpose and its body didn’t recognise the need or desire for it. Kevin and Catherine said Daniel's condition had been tough on his elder sister Hannah . Previously, Daniel would sit at the dinner table during family meal times but had to be entertained with toys. Boots Manager Kevin said: 'It has been my dream to have my whole family enjoying a meal around the dinner table. 'The strain on his sister, Hannah, 10, has been enormous - to see your brother starving himself would be traumatic at any age, but she has been wonderful and is a credit to her brother. 'We have fought for five years to get Daniel to eat and we have always kept an open mind. 'You have to remain positive even when things get really tough, and it’s amazing to watch him eat and enjoy his food.'","Daniel associated painful acid reflux with eating so was fed via a stomach tube .

Eastern European immigrants complain that British schools are failing to challenge their children, a survey has found. Some take trips home to see medical specialists because they regard the NHS as too slow to provide treatment. The concerns of parents from Poland and other Eastern European countries were recorded in a paper published yesterday by the Government’s Economic and Social Research Council. Learning curve: Eastern European immigrants complain that British schools are failing to challenge their children, a survey has found . Academics aimed to investigate discrimination suffered by foreign children but ended in recommending extra efforts by schools to ‘ensure that migrant children are challenged academically.’ Some Eastern European parents were worried that children were working below their academic level. Others were taking weekend trips to their home countries to get medical or dental treatment for their children instead of waiting months in Britain. The findings were based on detailed interviews with 57 children and families from Poland and the other seven countries which joined the European Union in 2004. Since then as many as a million and a half workers from the new EU countries are estimated to have arrived in Britain to work. Returning home: Academics found that Polish and Eastern European families were making regular trips from their homes in Scotland to see doctors and dentists in their native countries . The research suggests that despite their comparative poverty, Eastern European countries that were communist until the 1990s provide superior public services to some available in Britain. According to the At Home Abroad report, ‘parents and children expressed high educational aspirations. On occasions, parents felt children were working below their ability in certain subjects.’ The report quoted a 15-year-old Lithuanian girl who said: ‘I want to be a dentist, so I know already what subjects I need, but sometimes the teachers think I wouldn’t understand things. But I’ve done much harder things back home, for example in maths and science.’ It said that parents worried that because their children are still learning English, teachers will think they are slow at all academic subjects. Academics also found that Polish and Eastern European families were making regular trips from their homes in Scotland to see doctors and dentists in their native countries. Different standards: A 12-year-old Bulgarian girl said she had to wait so long to see a specialist her mum decided to take a flight to Bulgaria and go and see the eye doctor . ‘This was often due to the perception that services were too expensive, might not be in their entitlement, or were different or worse than in their own country,’ their report said. An 11-year-old Polish girl said: ‘We went to see a dentist, and they said it’s four months wait, so my mum just said we’ll go to Poland for the weekend and we got all the dental work done there.’ A Polish mother told researchers: ‘My child has asthma and they said you need to wait two months for a specialist. “So I just decided to take a flight to Poland and see the doctor we know there.’ And a 12-year-old Bulgarian girl said: ‘We had to wait to see a specialist so long, so my mum decided to take a flight to Bulgaria and go and see the eye doctor who treated me there first, it was quicker.’ All 57 children in the survey lived in Scotland, where NHS waiting times are generally shorter than those in England. Dr Daniela Sime of the University of Strathclyde said: ‘This study gave the young participants a voice and recognised that their experiences are shared. It also gave them an opportunity to offer ideas on how provision can be improved to support migrant families with children.’","New paper suggests that Eastern Europeans are taking trips home to see medical specialists .

Penny-pinching airlines have begun charging couples and families additional fees to guarantee seats next to each other. Since last summer, American, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines and United Airlines have increased the percentage of coach seats requiring an extra fee in a bid to boost revenue. It means friends and family members who don't pay the supplement are often forced to sit separately. Checking in: But many airlines are now charging a $25 premium to families who want to be guaranteed seats next to each other . While passengers who buy tickets two or more months in advance can normally book adjoining seats, many are increasingly finding that the only way to sit next to a spouse, child or friend is to shell out $25 or more, each way. But with base fares on the rise – the average domestic roundtrip ticket this summer is forecast by Kayak.com to be $431, or three per cent higher than last year – some families are reluctant to cough up more money. 'Who wants to fly like this?' says Khampha Bouaphanh, a photographer from Fort Worth, Texas. 'It gets more ridiculous every year.' Bouaphanh balked at paying an extra $114 roundtrip in fees to reserve three adjacent seats for him, his wife and their 4-year-old daughter on an upcoming trip to Disney World. 'I'm hoping that when we can get to the counter, they can accommodate us for free,' he says. Should families have to pay additional fees to sit together on planes? Airlines say their gate agents try to help family members without adjacent seats sit together, especially people flying with small children. Yet there is no guarantee things will work out. Not everyone is complaining. Frequent business travelers used to get stuck with middle seats even though their last-minute fares were two or three times higher than the average. Now, airlines are setting aside more window and aisle seats for their most frequent fliers at no extra cost. 'The customers that are more loyal, who fly more often, we want to make sure they have the best travel experience,' says Eduardo Marcos, American Airline's manager of merchandising strategy. For everybody else, choosing seats on airline websites has become more of a guessing game. To travelers who haven't earned 'elite' status in a frequent flier program, flights often appear full even though they are not. These casual travelers end up paying extra for an aisle or window seat believing they have no other option. But as flights get closer many of the seats airlines had set aside for those willing to pay a premium do become available – at no extra cost. 'Airlines are holding these seats hostage,' says George Hobica, founder of travel site AirfareWatchdog. 'The seat selection process isn't as fair as it used to be.' Airlines are searching for more ways to raise revenue to offset rising fuel costs. In the last five years, they have added fees for checked baggage, watching TV, skipping security lines and boarding early. Promise: Airlines say their staff do try to help family members without adjacent seats sit together, especially people flying with small children . Now they are turning to seats. Some – like those on Delta, JetBlue Airways and United – come with more legroom. Others, including those on American and US Airways, are just as cramped but are window and aisle seats near the front. Allegiant Air and Spirit Airlines go one step further, charging extra for any advanced seat assignment. On Spirit, passengers who aren't willing to pay the extra $5 to $15 per flight, are assigned a seat at check-in. The computer doesn't make any effort to keep families together. 'It gets really difficult, unfortunately, because all you end up with is a lot of onesies and twosies,' says Barry Biffle, Spirit's chief marketing officer. 'If you want to sit together, we would highly encourage you to get seat assignments in advance.' Delta just launched a discounted 'Basic Economy' fare on certain routes where it competes with Spirit that doesn't include advance seat assignments. 'Airlines have to be careful. They can only push this so far before they risk incurring the wrath of customers or the government,' says Henry Harteveldt, co-founder Atmosphere Research Group. Summer brings passengers traveling in larger groups and fewer empty seats. Last July and August, a record 86.4 percent of seats were filled by paying customers. Planes will be 'slightly fuller this year,' says John P. Heimlich, chief economist at the industry's trade group, Airlines for America. Add in seats occupied by off-duty airline staff and passengers who redeemed frequent-flier miles, and on many flights there won't be a spare seat. On a July flight from Dallas to San Francisco on American, a recent search showed only 28 of 144 coach seats available for passengers unwilling to pay extra. Of those, 21 were middle seats. There were five spots where a couple could sit together; groups of three or more were out of luck. It was dramatically different for elite frequent fliers. They could pick from 75 seats including nine rows with four or more seats together. Another flight – New York to Los Angeles on Delta – offered its most loyal fliers almost twice as many seats for free: 111 versus 60. For those unable to find two or more adjacent seats, new seat assignments can be snagged for free starting five days before departure as some elite fliers are upgraded to first class. Another block of seats is released 24 hours in advance when online check-in starts. Finally, gate agents can sometimes put families in seats set aside for disabled passengers or ask others to move.","American, Delta, Frontier and United have increased the percentage of coach seats requiring a supplement ."

Millions of pounds in penalty fines will be levied on failing Network Rail as an 'incentive' to make trains run on time, the Government’s official rail watchdog announced today. The aim is to improve punctuality for the nation’s beleaguered rail users faced with late and cancelled trains and soaring fares. In future, Network Rail will be hit with a £15million fine for every percentage point it falls below its agreed punctuality target for long-distance services. Painful reading: The Government's rail watchdog will be hitting Network Rail with fines for 'unacceptably' late or cancelled trains in a bid to improve punctuality . From next year, 92 per cent of trains must run on time. Currently the figure is 89.2 per cent, equivalent to more than one in 10 trains running behind schedule. If Network Rail fails to improve on that figure, it faces a £42million fine. Last year, the journeys of 13.7million passengers travelling on long-distance trains were affected by late or cancelled services – a scandal the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) found 'unacceptable'. Network Rail’s punctuality performance failures mean it is currently on track to breach the terms of its licence to operate, according to the watchdog. Frustrating: Disgruntled passengers wait for their delayed train to arrive at Clapham Junction. Network Rail could be fined up to £42million if it does not ensure 92 per cent of services run on time . The rail watchdog announced its punitive action today because of increasing dissatisfaction with poor time-keeping on the nations railways. Network Rail may even face a separate one-off fine for poor performance this year. A spokesman for the ORR said: ‘We have told Network Rail to deliver better levels of punctuality for passengers on long-distance train services or face a substantial penalty. 'The aim is to give Network Rail an incentive to improve. We don’t want to fine them. We want the trains to run on time. They are responsible for that  performance.' The regulator has instructed Network Rail to deliver plans, agreed with train operators, for better levels of punctuality on long-distance services in 2012-13. It must also speed-up further improvements towards meeting its committed punctuality target of 92 per cent in 2013-14. Pledge: Network Rail boss David Higgins (pictured) said he is 'determined to all we can' to improve reliability . The ORR said: 'If the company fails to deliver the 2013-14 target it will face a substantial financial penalty. 'The size of any financial penalty will reflect the extent of Network Rail’s failure to meet the commitment, increasing by £1.5 million per 0.1 percentage point it drops below the 92% punctuality target.' However, the regulator said passengers are experiencing good levels of punctuality 'by historical standards'. But it stressed: ‘Network Rail committed to achieving more, and taxpayers and customers have paid the company to deliver. 'Our investigation showed that the company struggled to cope with the challenges of reaching its long distance punctuality target.' An increase in cable theft has caused many cancellations, but the watchdog stressed that many of the problems - including timetable planning and predicting and spotting equipment failures - are 'of the company’s own making'. ORR chief executive Richard Price, said: 'Levels of punctuality on long distance rail services across Britain are good by historical standards, but passengers should be experiencing even better levels of train performance, benefitting from the punctuality commitments which they and taxpayers have funded Network Rail to deliver.' Network Rail’s funding for the next five year period (2014-2019) will be in part dependent on any ‘failure to deliver’ on performance now. The watchdog said: 'We concluded that Network Rail is likely to be in breach of its licence with regards to performance in the long-distance sector in 2013-14.' 'Unacceptable': Last year, the journeys of 13.7million passengers travelling on long-distance trains were affected by late or cancelled services . It has proposed, subject to statutory consultation, to make an enforcement order requiring Network Rail to meet its performance target of 92 per cent, adding: 'Furthermore, we will be carefully monitoring progress of the agreed plans for 2012-13 and will take further action if they are not being delivered.' In January 2012, the regulator issued an enforcement order requiring Network Rail to develop new, robust plans to help recover long distance performance. The measure for punctuality  for long distance trains allows them to arrive at their final destination within ten minutes of the advertised time. Network Rail committed to, and was funded to achieve, 92 per cent of trains arriving within that wnidow in 2012-13. Network Rail’s current long-distance punctuality is 89.2per cent – which would leave it with £42million fine. It has plans in place to take it to 90.4per cent, which is still below its target and would incur a £24 million fine. Backing: Rail Performance Minister Norman Baker has commended the watchdog's robust approach . Network Rail chief executive Sir David Higgins said: ‘We welcome the ORR's recognition that we, and the train operating companies, have already done much to improve long-distance punctuality in this control period - which is currently running at a record level of 89.2 per cent for the past year - and we accept the challenge to deliver an even better service. 'We are determined to do all we can to achieve that through balancing the continued growth in demand with passengers' desire for improved reliability in terms of punctuality.' ORR chief executive Mr Price said in future train companies will also be required to publish exact 'right time' figures showing ‘to the minute’ on every journey how late trains really are – not just broad averages or whether trains arrive within the generous ten minute punctuality window they currently enjoy. Anthony Smith, chief executive of rail customer watchdog Passenger Focus, said: 'We know from our research that getting trains on time is both the key driver of passenger satisfaction and a key priority for improvement. 'Performance has not been good enough and it is good to see action being taken so that passengers can get back to depending on the railway to deliver them on time.' Rail Performance Minister Norman Baker said: 'I hope the ORR's robust approach will encourage NR in driving up performance and improving reliability for passengers.' Michael Roberts, Chief Executive of the Association of Train Operating Companies (ATOC) representing the train firms who use the tracks run by Network rail said: 'The regulator is right to take a firm line with Network Rail. The big problem for long distance rail passengers is lack of consistency in train service punctuality and Network Rail needs to do a better job of managing the track and signals to resolve this.'","Rail operator must get 92% of services running on time next year to avoid penalties .

George Osborne scrapped a 3p rise in fuel duty yesterday in yet another Budget U-turn. The Chancellor said the move – greeted with delight by campaigners and motoring groups – reflected the ‘very difficult economic times’. A duty rise in January had previously been axed and the latest freeze knocks £2.10 off the cost of filling up a typical family car. Embarrassing: In yet another budget backtrack, Mr Osborne told the Commons that the levy would now be 10p a litre lower than under the plans inherited from Labour . Mr Osborne had already staged four . major Budget U-turns, on pasties, caravans, charities and church works. His latest retreat follows weeks of pressure from motoring groups, . industry leaders and even Tory MPs who said the economy could not afford . a tax hike. Defying the calls, the Chancellor had . insisted the duty rise was necessary to reduce the Government’s deficit. Mixed messages: The climbdown comes just a day after Transport Secretary Justine Greening said she was not prepared to stand in the way of the planned rise in fuel duty . Only two days ago, Transport Secretary Justine Greening rejected a . rethink as well, insisting it was better to  pressure retailers to . reduce pump prices. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, who called . yesterday morning for the 3p rise to be axed, said it was ‘the fastest . U-turn in history’. Treasury sources insisted it was not a . U-turn because the hike – scheduled for August – was a policy from the . last Labour government. Mr Osborne told MPs the £550million in lost revenue would be made up for by lower than expected departmental spending. He said fuel was 10p a litre cheaper than it would have been under Labour’s plans. ‘We are on the side of working . families and businesses and this will fuel our recovery at this very . difficult economic time for the world,’ the Chancellor added. Treasury sources said the move was . discussed a month ago by the Coalition’s all-powerful ‘quad’ – David . Cameron, Mr Osborne, Nick Clegg and Danny Alexander. ‘At the Budget we decided to review . the situation over the summer,’ said an insider. ‘Since then, the . international situation has deteriorated and the economy went back into . recession. ‘Oil and pump prices are falling, but . are still high by historical standards. As for Ed Balls, it’s the . classic opposition tactic of trying to guess what the Government will do . and calling for it.’ The source insisted it was routine for . changes to fuel duty to be announced outside Budget statements, saying . Labour had done so four times. But there were counter-claims that the . final decision was only taken yesterday, ahead of the Chancellor’s last . scheduled appearance before the Commons before the summer recess. Petrol prices have fallen to an average of 133p a litre, from 138p in March. Where does your money go?

Going up: How the price of petrol and diesel keeps rising although for the past year the cost of brent (crude) oil has fallen, but prices have remained high . Professor Stephen Glaister of the RAC . Foundation said: ‘This is good news for drivers and good news for the . country. Road transport powers the nation’s economy and it is welcome . that the Chancellor recognises the huge pressures the country’s . 35million drivers are under with transport being the biggest single area . of household expenditure bar none.’ Neil Bentley, deputy director-general . of the CBI, said: ‘This decision will be welcomed by hard-pressed . families and businesses across the country.’ Jibe: Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, who called yesterday morning for the 3p rise to be axed, said it was 'the fastest U-turn in history' The AA said freezing duty would spare the typical two-car family a £6.41-a-month increase in petrol costs – £76 a year. Its president, Edmund King, said: . ‘This is great news for all motorists as drivers will breathe an . enormous sigh of relief with summer holidays about to take off. ‘A duty increase at the same time as the Olympics would have cast a shadow over the UK.’ Quentin Willson, of the campaign group . FairFuel UK, said: ‘Businesses and hard-working families across this . country will breathe a grateful sigh of relief, at least for the rest of . this year.’ Conservative MP Robert Halfon, who has . led a campaign for a fuel duty freeze, said: ‘Motorists across the . country will welcome the cut. It will greatly improve the performance of . the economy.’ Some Tory MPs are angry that they have been defending a position their leaders were planning to give up . Just two hours before the Chancellor . made his announcement to the Commons, party whips circulated ‘lines to . take’ to MPs, suggesting they attack Labour’s ‘hypocritical’ position. Mr Balls, who used an article in The . Sun and TV interviews to urge a Government rethink, said yesterday: . ‘This is the fastest U-turn in history. Labour called for this help for . families and businesses this morning and I welcome the fact the . Chancellor backed down this afternoon. ‘With U-turns on petrol, pasties, . caravans, charities and churches, George Osborne’s Budget is now in . tatters – a true omnishambles of a Budget from a part-time Chancellor . whose reputation is now badly damaged.’ August’s 3p rise has been postponed until January.","George Osborne says move reflected 'very difficult economic times'

Wreckage found on an Alaskan glacier is the remains of a missing Air Force plane that crashed in  the 1950s, killing all 52 people on board. Authorities revealed today the site has been identified after it was discovered on Knik Glacier near Anchorage earlier this month. It means the victims' families may finally get answers as to why their loved ones died nearly 60 years on from the tragedy. Specialised team: Team members from the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command and Northern Warefare Training Center, searches for aircraft wreckage on Knik Glacier near Anchorage, Alaska . Joint POW-MIA Accounting Command spokesperson Captain Jamie Dobson said the wreckage is of a Douglas C-124A Globemaster II. The Korean War-era Air Force cargo plane crashed on November 22, 1952, NBC station KTUU of Anchorage reported. It was found on June 10 on Colony . Glacier, around 45 miles east of Anchorage, by a UH-60 Blackhawk crew . with the Alaska Army National Guard. While evidence collected by the . eight-man team is en route to JPAC’s Central Identification Laboratory . in Hawaii for further analysis, Cpt Dobson said the plane was . identifiable by materials found at the scene. Identified: Captain Jamie Dobson said the wreckage spotted was that of a Douglas C-124A Globemaster II. The Korean War-era Air Force cargo plane went missing on November 22 . 'Some of the evidence has already been positively correlated with this crash,' Cpt Dobson told KTUU. Harsh weather prevented a recovery at the time and later the authorities could not locate it. The Globemaster II entered Air Force service in 1950 as the world’s largest transport plane. Its forward loading ramp and aft . cargo elevator, as well as its ability to carry 68,500 pounds of cargo . or 200 passengers on two decks of seating, made it the Air Force's . primary heavy-lift transport into the early 1960s. Workhorse: The Douglas C-124C Globemaster II was the largest transport aircraft when it was introduced into service in 1950 . In action: Seen here in the Korean War the aircraft's unique front-loading system allowed for 68,000lbs of cargo or 200 passengers seated on two decks . The four-propeller transport was . eventually replaced by the C-141 Starlifter jet, but its name lives on . in Alaska skies with the C-17 Globemaster III, operated by the 517th .

Gates may have been the world's youngest self-made billionaire but Shafay Thobani, 8, could be his up and coming rival after becoming the world’s youngest Microsoft specialist. The boy from Pakistan has mastered complicated internet protocol and domain name systems to become a Microsoft Certified Technology Specialist (MCTS) in Microsoft Windows 7 Configuration and Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2. Whizz kid: Shafay Thobani, 8, has become the world's youngest Microsoft specialist, doing 13 months of training and classes to get the Microsoft certification . Instead of playing video games or ball sports, Shafay spent 13 months studying to pass IT and software tests, scoring 91 per cent to get the certification. The rigorous learning meant he spent afternoons after school in a 1,000 sq ft training area for five hours of structured computer classes. Taking up technology young: Even at three-years-old Shafay found technology more interesting than his own toys . Tough teaching: The boy spent his afternoons in structured, five hour computer classes for 13 months with teacher Faisal Durrani (far right) Dr Shau Thobani, his father and CEO of Thobson Technologies introduced Shafay to the world of technology from a young age. He said: ‘When he was three years old he was more interested by my electronics than he was in his own toys. ‘Even when he was small, I saw something different in Shafay. ‘I saw a spark in his personality. ‘Because of the nature of my work, Shafay has been born into the world of IT and technology and that is where I think he interest in computers stems from. ‘He's so intelligent. He does complicated maths on his hands instead of a calculator. ‘I feel like the luckiest parent because at the end of each day I only ever receive very positive feedback from Shafay's teachers. ‘Every year I give Shafay a new challenge to try and encourage him. Dr Thobani said Shafay can do whatever he wants with his career. He said: ‘I'm not forcing Shafay to do anything in his future. He will decide what he wants to do himself. ‘This view is quite unusual in our country because in Pakistan, a child's parents often force them into a specific career.’ Father's pride: Shafay's father Dr Shau Thobani (left), who is CEO of Thobson Technologies, says he is 'the luckiest parent' Microsoft master: Bill Gates, the co founder of Microsoft, also showed a keen interest in computers and technology from a young age . Microsoft spokesperson Thomas Jensen said becoming certified shows a recognised level of understanding. He said: ‘Microsoft does not keep track of the ages of the people who take the certification. 'I'm not aware of anyone younger than Shafay however I can't officially confirm this. ‘Becoming certified does not lead to employment within Microsoft and those who are certified are not paid but becoming a Certified Technology Specialist proves that you've gone through the certification process and have a certain and recognised level of understanding.’ There are specific certifications for various Microsoft products and they are designed to validate a person’s skills on the features and functionality of the software. The Microsoft website says: ‘Designed to be relevant in today's rapidly changing IT marketplace, Microsoft Certifications help you utilise evolving technologies, fine-tune your troubleshooting skills, and improve your job satisfaction’.","Shafay Thobani is now a Microsoft Certified Technology Specialist .

The challenges they have faced could not be more different – but their victories are equally remarkable. Two British athletes took gold medals as the Paralympics got off to a glittering start yesterday. Cyclist Sarah Storey, born without a functioning left hand, stormed to victory in the 3km C5 individual pursuit. Pool's gold: Celebral palsy sufferer Jonathan Fox (left) won gold in the 110m backstroke and Sarah Storey, who romped to victory in the velodrome . And less than two hours later, swimmer Jonathan Fox, who has cerebral palsy, did the same in the S7 100m backstroke. On an inspiring day of record-breaking performances, Fox's achievement made him the first British Olympic or Paralympic athlete to win gold in the pool. And while Team GB failed to win a single medal on the opening day of the Olympics, Paralympics GB took seven, with three silvers and two bronze as well as the two golds. The team is hoping to go on to beat its record haul of 102 medals in Beijing. Storey, 34, was cheered by record crowds as she took her 19th Paralympic medal in two different sports. She has now won five golds in swimming and three in cycling, with the prospect of a further three in this year's Paralympics. She capped her win with a lap of honour as the crowd, which included deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and Lord Coe, continued to roar their support. Storey eased around the track, smashing the world record time for the individual CV pursuit . Britain's Jonathan Fox swims towards winning gold in the men's 100m Backstroke S7 category . Fox's achievement made him the first British Olympic or Paralympic athlete to win gold in the pool . Later, the Paralympic team's spectacular start was sealed when Fox made a splash in the pool. The 21-year-old, who won silver four years ago in Beijing and had broken the world record in the semi-final heats, said the medal was his 'life's dream.' Elsewhere, cyclist Mark Colbourne, 42, collected silver in the men's individual 1km Time Trial just three years after suffering appalling injuries when he plummeted 40ft to the ground in a paragliding accident. In the pool, 16-year-old Hannah Russell, who has achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism, won silver in the women's S12 400m freestyle. Her achievement was matched by Nyree Kindred, 31, in the S6 100 backstroke, as her 15 month-old daughter Ella watched – and there was a special cheer from the crowd when she picked up the little girl after the race. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were at the Velodrome to lend their support to Storey . The Duchess paid particular attention to Lady Louise Windsor and leaned in for an intimate chat with the young Royal . Moments earlier spectators had watched in awe as Kindred was beaten to the gold by Chinese swimmer Lu Dong, who has no arms and clenches a towel in her teeth at the start because she cannot hold the edge of the pool, in a world record time. It was one of a catalogue of extraordinary superhuman performances by athletes that had spectators spell bound across Paralympic venues. They included world records set in the Velodrome by cyclists with only one leg and a cyclist with no arms. With virtual sell-out crowds across all Paralympic venues, the excitement and atmosphere that made the Olympics such a triumph was quickly recreated as spectators turned out in their tens of thousands. Once again the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were among the biggest cheerleaders, with visits to see the British team in the goalball in the Copper Box and then to the Velodrome where they witnessed Storey smash the world record. To the delight of the highly vocal 6,000-strong crowd, Kate and William joined in with a slow motion Mexican wave, alongside Sophie, Countess of Wessex, and her daughter Lady Louise Windsor. The eight-year-old was a bridesmaid at Kate and William's wedding, and Kate displayed her continued close relationship with the Queen's granddaughter as she leaned in to talk to her at the event. Kate and William both dressed casually – her in a red Paralympics GB polo neck, him in a blue one – and wore matching red training shoes. Earlier, they had made a brief visit to watch the GB men's goalball team play Lithuania at the Copper Box, where Kate arrived wearing a blue Paralympics GB sweat top. Her outfit was completed by a pair of navy jeans. The pair looked fresh-faced despite a late night at the spectacular opening ceremony. Viewing figures released by Channel 4 showed the ceremony drew a peak audience of 11.2million – the broadcaster's biggest in a decade, and four times that of the opening in Beijing four years ago. Craig Spence, the International Paralympic Committee's director of media and communications, hailed the 'fantastic' ceremony  a success. He said: 'It gave a reflection of all impairment groups and I think it showed how far the Paralympic movement has come.'","Cyclist Sarah Storey stormed to victory in the 3km C5 individual pursuit .

Norfolk businessman Bernard Matthews (left), and lover Odile Marteyn (right) But it has now emerged in a High Court . case that his three adopted children – who were left nothing in his . will – have defied this wish and are claiming their share of the villa. Despite the three wills, Mr Matthews . knew that he was powerless against French inheritance laws, which . decreed that 75 per cent of his property would go to his family. So in 2006, four years before he died . aged 80, he wrote a letter addressed to Joyce, at that time his wife of . 54 years, and 'all members of my family'. In it, he described how 'Odile has . supported me unfailingly for years', and reminded his children that he . had already been generous to them and long provided financial support. Inheritance: Kathleen Matthews, one of the three children Mr Matthews adopted with his wife Joyce . Miss Marteyn, now 62, was at Mr . Matthews's bedside when he died, along with his wife.

The 30-year-old internet entrepreneur is not claiming his share of the French villa.

This leaves Miss Marteyn with 43.75 . per cent, but Judge Nicholas Strauss QC said she 'accepts that there is . nothing she can do about this'. The case came to the High Court . because the children had argued that the £2million inheritance tax they . are liable to pay on their share of the villa should  be paid out of . their late father's English estate. However, rejecting their arguments, . Judge Strauss said Mr Matthews had clearly wished Miss Marteyn to . inherit the entire villa and to have her French inheritance tax bill . paid from his estate. 'He did not want his adopted children to have any part of the property. He concluded: 'For this reason, I hold . that the adopted children have no right under the English will to have . their tax liability discharged, or to be reimbursed if they have paid . it.'

Bonnie and Clyde have been dead 75 years, but their days of emptying bank vaults aren't over. On Sunday an anonymous buyer shelled out more than half a million dollars to purchase two pistols the infamous robbers were carrying when they were gunned down by police in 1934. Bonnie Parker's .38-caliber Colt Detective Special and Clyde Barrow's .45-caliber Colt Model 1911 were the biggest-ticket items in a $1.1million auction of 134 artifacts in Nashua, New Hampshire. Bonnie get your gun: The Colt .38 snub-nose detective special revolver, let, was found taped to the thigh of Bonnie Clyde after she was shot by Texas and Louisiana police officers. Clyde Barrow was carrying the Colt.45 Model 1911 Government Model Semi-auto pistol, right, in his waistband . Crime spree: Bonnie and Clyde became infamous as they traveled across America's Midwest and South, holding up banks and stores with other gang members . About two-thirds of the auctioned . items were from Bonnie and Clyde, but items also came from other . notorious criminals, including Al Capone, Pretty Boy Floyd and John . Dillinger. Bonnie's snub-nosed Colt revolver was . discovered taped to her thigh when she was killed in Louisiana. It drew . the highest bid and sold for $264,000, said Bobby Livingston, vice . president of RR Auction in Amherst, New Hampshire, which held the . auction. Clyde Model 1911 automatic sold for $240,000 to the same bidder, who didn't want to be named, Mr Livingston said. 'When rare items like that come up . for sale you expect this kind of enthusiasm,' Livingston said. 'There . was some serious bidding going on.' Many of the auction items came from . the estate of the late collector Robert Davis of Waco, Texas, with the . remainder coming from various other collections. Most of the items came from famous . gangsters and outlaws, but some were linked to law enforcement officials . including Elliot Ness and Texas Ranger Frank Hamer, who led a posse . that tracked down and killed Bonnie and Clyde in Louisiana. Clyde's pocket watch sold for . $36,000, Mr Livingston said. A 1921 Morgan silver dollar that was found . in his pocket after he was killed sold for $32,000 . Also in the auction was a letter that Clyde wrote to his brother L.C. Barrow on the back of a photo showing a house on a platform surrounded by water.

Notorious: Bonnie Parker, playfully points a shotgun at her partner Clyde Barrow in 1932 . FBI files say Bonnie and Clyde met in Texas in 1930 and were believed to have committed 13 murders and several robberies and burglaries by the time they died. Law enforcement officials were among their victims. The duo became infamous as they traveled across America's Midwest and South, holding up banks and stores with other gang members. Texas Ranger Frank Hamer led the posse of six lawmen who carried out the ambush, and auction officials said authorities gifted him the guns from the lovers' bodies as part of his compensation for the operation. Jonathan Davis, whose book ""Bonnie & Clyde & Marie: A Sister's Perspective on the Notorious Barrow Gang"" is expected out shortly, befriended Marie Barrow in the early 1990s and is acting as an advisor for the auction. Clyde Barrow's 10 Karat gold 1925 Elgin pocket watch, found on his body the morning of his death . He said Thursday that people are drawn to Bonnie and Clyde memorabilia because of the romantic aspect of their story and because there's always an interest in outlaws. L.J. Hinton, the son of a Texas deputy sheriff who was part of the ambush, shared a similar view Thursday. Besides the outlaws' love story, he said people also have been fascinated by Bonnie and Clyde because they became Robin Hood-like characters by robbing banks during the Depression. The 78-year-old retired law-enforcement official manages the Bonnie & Clyde Ambush Museum in Gibsland, Louisiana, the town where the takedown happened. He predicted the September auction will attract a lot of interest. 'Just hang on to your hat, because it will be a bidding war,' he said.

Cassidy, the infamous Old West bank robber, bought the revolver in a hardware store in Vernal, Utah, in 1896. He turned it over to Utah authorities in early 1900 in an unsuccessful attempt to gain amnesty. Known as the 'Amnesty Colt,' it is the most documented of Cassidy's guns.

A person of interest has been named in the 1969 deaths of a mother and her five children who were all killed during a horrific house fire. Investigators initially believed the fire, which ravaged Nancy and David Landers’ Wilmington, Massachusetts home, was caused by a defective power outlet behind the family’s living room sofa. However, authorities now have said that an ex-con who has recently started visiting the family grace site on the anniversary of their deaths could have something to do with the inferno that claimed the lives of Nancy Launder and five of her children, aged seven to 13. Tragedy: A September 1969 house fire killed Nancy Landers and five of her children; now, police have named an ex-con as a person of interest in their deaths . Scorched: The family's home in Wilmington, Massachusetts was badly burned and left five children and their mother dead . Susan Landers, one of two of the children who survived the blaze, told FoxNews.com that she ran into the unnamed person of interest last Memorial Day at the family’s grave site. Susan, who is now married and goes by Susan McNamara, said that the 62-year-old ex-con approached her last year. ‘He said a whole series of things to me, including that he was a Christian man now,’ she told the website. ‘He claimed he spoke to my father before he passed away and that my father gave him forgiveness.’Mrs McNamara said that in 1969, Wilmington police had questioned her about the person of interest, but no charges were filed against him. According to the Wilmington Patch, the decades-old police records were either lost or destroyed. Police told FoxNews.com that the ex-convict has a string of criminal convictions, including a 1994 armed assault and an attempted robbery charge in the 1980s. On the quiet streets of Wilmington, about 10 miles north of Boston, the Landers family slept quietly in their home. It was September 26, 1969. Wrecked: Investigators initially said the blaze was a result of faulty wiring in the family living room; here, a chair and desk have been destroyed by flames . Arson or accident? New leads have led authorities to believe that the fire, which left some parts of the house untouched, could have been intentional . In the middle of the night, the family awoke to find their house ablaze. Nancy, 37, was killed, as well as her children K.C., 4, Lisa, 7, Kevin, 9, Billy, 12, and Davey, 13. Nancy’s husband David and three of their children, Harry, Susan, and Michael, managed to survive. According to the Wilmington Town Crier, David crawled his way into the smoke, finding Susan. By breaking a window and placing her on the roof of the burning house, he managed to save her life.However, Nancy died in the couple’s bedroom, along with Lisa and K.C. The boys, who were in a second-story bedroom, also perished. The family’s cousin Joseph Casey, who was visiting at the time of the fire, also escaped with his life.New investigations show that it is unlikely that the fire was caused by a malfunctioning electrical outlet, as it is now believed that the 3am blaze had two points of origin. Destroyed: The surviving family members lived in a trailer outside the house while repairs were being made; the father said someone tried to set the trailer ablaze as well . Janis Jaquith, the wife of oldest child Harry Landers, has done extensive research on the fire. A 1970 graduate of Wilmington High School, she has interviewed neighbours and investigators working on the case. She firmly believes the fire was an act of arson. She wrote in the Wilmington Patch that David Landers, who died two years ago, lived in a trailer next to the house while it was being repaired. He remembered smelling gasoline around the trailer and found two newspapers soaked in gasoline.However, police never found anyone in conjunction with the attempted arson. Mrs McNamara said that the sheer dreadfulness of losing her mother and five siblings in one night meant that the surviving members of her family didn’t speak of the fire for some 40 years.","Former convict, whose name has not been publically released, named person of interest in 1969 house fire that killed mother and five children .

The BBC was facing calls last night to open an investigation into Sir Jimmy Savile’s alleged child abuse. The broadcaster insisted it had conducted extensive searches of its files and had found no record of any allegations of misconduct by the presenter. But, amid repeated claims that it was an ‘open secret’ about Mr Savile’s interest in young girls at the BBC, critics say the corporation must make renewed efforts to find out the truth, even if it was many years ago. Damning: Critics say the BBC should open an investigation into Sir Jimmy Savile's alleged child abuse after claims it was an 'open secret' about his interest in young girls at the BBC . The controversy is heightened by the BBC’s decision to drop a Newsnight investigation into Savile. Former Newsnight political editor Michael Crick, now at Channel 4 News, tweeted that the BBC should take immediate action. ‘Somebody in George Entwistle’s office should be preparing a very strong BBC apology statement over Savile right now and get it out at once,’ he said. ‘The BBC pulled the Newsnight expose on Savile last December. 'Big question is who knew what and when about what he did on BBC premises.’ Philip Davies – a Tory MP on the culture, media and sport select committee – said: ‘They should look at it and not be so complacent about what are such serious allegations. They should find out who was aware at what stage.’ Following the death of the Top Of The Pops presenter in October 2011, Newsnight contacted ten former pupils of Duncroft Approved School, near Staines, west London, who said they had been victims. Programme chiefs decided the film could air only if it was established that police in Surrey had investigated the star.

There is speculation about what other BBC executives knew about the report – and whether Mr Rippon was placed under any pressure. The BBC had insisted it is ‘absolutely untrue’ that the report was dropped for anything other than editorial reasons, saying the story had not been substantiated.

"By . Becky Barrow . PUBLISHED: . 18:34 EST, 1 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 19:02 EST, 1 October 2012 . The pensions revolution affecting up to 11million workers began yesterday. It is the biggest shake-up of pensions for more than a century and was hailed by ministers as ‘a truly radical social change’. For the first time, every boss will be forced to pay into a pension for their workers, who will be automatically signed up to the scheme. Pensions Minister Steve Webb, pictured, said the start of auto-enrolment, whereby for the first time every boss will be forced to pay into a pension for their workers, is a 'major milestone' Yesterday the first workers were ‘enrolled’ into the new pension schemes, with around 800,000 expected to be signed up before Christmas. Most workers aged between 22 and state pension age who are not members of a pension scheme will be signed up to a pension by their boss, known as automatic enrolment. Only the lowest earners, whose annual salary is £8,105 or less, will be exempted from the scheme. Workers who are auto-enrolled will join either a company scheme or the National Employment Savings Trust, known as NEST. At present, the majority of private sector workers do not put any money into a pension. If they do have a pension pot, it is worth an average of just £26,000. Under the new scheme, if a 30-year-old saved £50 a month, the pot would be worth around £90,000 at the age of 65, if the fund grew by 7 per cent a year. A £90,000 pension pot buys a 65-year-old man a pension of about £4,850 per year. A £26,000 pot buys an annual pension of about £1,500. The scheme was suggested by Lord Turner in 2005 when he was asked by the Labour government to try to solve Britain’s pensions crisis, but the launch has been a long time coming. Pensions Minister Steve Webb said yesterday that the start of auto-enrolment represents ‘a major milestone’ for workers as well as the Government’s attempt to solve the crisis. ‘Few policies affect as many people and this will be a truly radical social change,’ he said. Under the new scheme, if a 30-year-old saved £50 a month, the pot would be worth around £90,000 at the age of 65 . ‘I’m determined to make sure that pensions are no longer seen as the preserve of the few.’ He said it made a break from many other Government reforms which he described as ‘just awful and horrible’. Mr Webb hailed the shake-up as the biggest pensions revolution since state pensions were introduced by a 1908 Act of Parliament. The CBI, Britain’s biggest business lobby group, said it is the start of ‘a new dawn for pension savers’ which it said will ‘tackle the ticking retirement time bomb’. Workers will pay into their pension – but so will their boss and the Government will also make its own contribution through tax relief. Contributions will begin low but will rise to 4 per cent of salary from workers, 3 per cent from their boss and 1 per cent from tax relief in October 2018, making a total of 8 per cent of salary. Workers will have the right to opt out immediately if they do not want to save into a pension for whatever reason, but bosses have no right to encourage, or even force, them to opt out. The Government admits it expects around a third of workers will opt out, with many expected to say they simply cannot afford to save at the current time. Britain’s biggest companies will be the first to enrol their workers, a process which began yesterday, followed by smaller businesses over the next six years. In October, around 380,000 workers will be signed up, followed by a further 420,000 in November, and workers will continue to be signed up over the next few years. Between February and May next year, around 6.5million will be automatically enrolled. Nobody can escape, from Tesco having to enrol workers who are not currently in the supermarket’s pension scheme to a couple who employ a nanny to look after their young children. An advertising campaign featuring TV stars such as Theo Paphitis and Nick Hewer was launched recently to raise awareness of the shake-up. Stephen Gay, director of savings at the Association of British Insurers, said: ‘Automatic enrolment is an opportunity not to be missed. ‘It cannot be stressed enough how important it is to save for retirement. ‘The fact that we are living longer is great, but we can no longer have our heads in the sand about how we fund our income in retirement. ‘The state pension is a foundation, but most people need more and the earlier people start to save the easier they will find it to build enough savings for their later life.’ The shake-up comes after official figures showed the number of private sector workers with a company pension scheme has collapsed to its lowest level since records began in 1953. Of the country’s 23.9million private sector workers, only 2.9million are paying into a company pension scheme. At their peak in 1967, there were 8.1million members.","New scheme has been hailed by ministers as 'truly radical social change'

A convicted murderer confessed to his prison cell-mate that he was a 'modern-day hitman' who killed a retired colonel on his doorstep eight years ago for cash, a court heard today. Christopher Docherty-Puncheon, 33, was already in prison on a separate murder charge when he confessed to killing retired colonel Lt Col Robert 'Riley' Workman, the jury heard. Lt Col Workman was killed at his home in Furneux Pelham, Hertfordshire, on January 7, 2004, but the case remained a mystery. 'Gunned down': Retired Army officer Robert 'Riley' Workman (left) was shot dead on his doorstep eight years ago, the court heard. Christopher Docherty-Puncheon (right) is accused of his murder . Lt Col Workman was killed at his home in Furneux Pelham, Hertfordshire, on January 7, 2004 . Docherty-Puncheon, a rat-catcher, who lived near the crime scene, allegedly revealed vital . details of the murder to his cell-mate. A court heard he deatiled how 83-year-old Colonel was holding a walking stick and looking away when the fatal shot was fired. Jurors at St Alban’s Crown Court were . told he explained to his cell-mate that 'didn’t like to shoot people . while looking into their eyes' and asked him to dispose of the murder . weapon if he was released. Lt . Col Workman was shot dead with a single blast from a sawn-off shotgun . after answering a night-time knock at the door of his rural cottage in . November 2004 in what is one of Britain’s most notorious unsolved . murders. Docherty-Puncheon, . who is in a civil partnership, also allegedly claimed he had had a . sexual relationship with the Colonel, describing him as 'wealthy and . generous'. Richard Latham QC, . prosecuting, told the court Docherty-Puncheon made the admissions to a . fellow prisoner as the pair watched a news report into the murder of . 21-year-old traveller Fred Moss. Docherty-Puncheon was later convicted . of Moss’ killing. Victim: Robert Workman, pictured in an armchair (left) and with his wife Joanna (right), was killed at his home in Furneux Pelham, Hertfordshire, in January 2004 . Mr Latham QC said: 'The defendant described himself as a modern-day hitman who killed people for money. 'He was proud of his expertise with firearms and his ability to manufacture ammunition. 'Later he claimed he had bought a Range Rover with the money he had been paid to kill Col Workman. The . court was told Docherty-Puncheon became 'annoyed' when his cell-mate . questioned his confessions and began revealing details of the murder. Mr . Latham QC said: 'He told [the prisoner] that he had known Colonel . Workman since 1998, that he had worked for him dealing with a wasps’ nest, that the two men had engaged in sexual activity with each other. 'He described his relationship with Col Workman in detail, stating that the Colonel was wealthy and generous with money. Mystery: The killing of Mr Workman, pictured with his wife Joanna, was described in court as a 'whodunnit' case . 'Initially, . he told him that he had killed the Col in connection with a matter . which occurred seven years previously, but he later told him that the . real reason was for money and that he’s been paid in cash.' The . court heard Docherty-Puncheon told his cell-mate other key details . including that he had called an ambulance and that the death had at . first been treated as natural causes before it was later realised he had . been killed. Docherty-Puncheon . also told his cell-mate where he had hidden the weapon he used to kill . Fred Moss and that information eventually led police to discover the . weapon, which had Moss’ DNA on it, the jury heard. Later, . Docherty-Puncheon made another confession to a second cell-mate, John . Horn, who received a reduction on his sentence for assault as a result . of passing on information of the confession, jurors heard. Mr . Latham said: 'It will no doubt be suggested to each of these men that . they are lying, that they have made up a story about the confession. That is why the independent evidence of the Moss trial and the basic facts surrounding it will be of great assistance to you.' 'Executed': Robert 'Riley' Workman, a retired lieutenant colonel, was 83 when he died . Earlier . the court was told Docherty-Puncheon received a number of calls to his . landline on the day of the murder but all were diverted to voicemail. Two hours after the fatal shot was . heard by a neighbour, the defendant used his mobile phone to call his . answerphone and pick up his messages, despite telling police officers he . was at home, the court was told. His Land Rover, which contained a . memorable personalised number plate spelling Soho, was also spotted . during the hours he told officers he was at home. During . a 25-year Army career the colonel, a Second World War veteran, was . stationed in Canada, Nigeria, Germany, and Cyprus and travelled widely . in the United States.

'Horrific torture': Roy Sly (pictured) was beaten to death over a prolonged period in his flat in Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex, a trial heard . A man found dead in his flat after being subjected to 'horrific torture' was so badly bruised police could not at first tell if he was male or female, a jury has heard. Unemployed Roy Sly, 53, was discovered in his flat in Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex, on January 10. It is thought he had been dead for at least a day and had suffered 59 separate injuries. As prosecutor William Clegg QC outlined the 'gruesome' case and passed graphic photographs of Mr Sly’s injuries to the jury, a female reserve juror fainted. Judge Christopher Ball told the jury at Chelmsford Crown Court: 'As you can see, this is not a case for the faint-hearted.' Mr Clegg said evidence suggested Mr Sly had been tied up while a broom handle was forced into his anus before he was beaten to death over a 'prolonged period'. Vincent Harty, 39, of Wakering Avenue, Shoeburyness; Lisa Turner, 33, of no fixed address, and Peter Smith, 38, of Furnace Row, Toredyrhiw, Merthyr Tydfil, all deny murder. Mr Clegg said: 'When police officers entered his flat they found his body lying in the lounge. 'His face had been so badly beaten that police were unable to tell if the body was that of a man or a woman.' Mr Clegg added that the 'true horror' of the attack was not revealed until the body was examined by a pathologist. 'His face was unrecognisable with numerous cuts and bruises to the head,' he said. 'There were signs of torture to the genital area. The penis had cuts and bruises. 'The anus had bruises confirming the worst fears that while still alive a broom handle or similar implement had been pushed so far into him that it had forced its way into his colon causing significant internal bleeding.' Mr Sly had suffered so many injuries that it was not possible to identify which was the sole cause of death, the court heard. Mr Clegg said: 'What is certain is that the attack did kill him.' Gruesome case: Judge Christopher Ball told the jury at Chelmsford Crown Court (above): 'As you can see, this is not a case for the faint-hearted' He described how Mr Sly had alcohol problems and his relationship with his family had suffered as a result. 'Because of his lifestyle he fell into a . sub-culture of people who tended to drink heavily, take drugs and live a . life where loose morals were the norm rather than the exception,' he . added. 'Friends and neighbours described him as a drunk. Not an aggressive drunk but a falling down drunk.' It was this lifestyle that led to him becoming friends with the defendants. Despite his problems, Mr Sly cared for his elderly mother, who survives him, Mr Clegg added. When officers arrived, a hypodermic . needle was sticking out of his arm but, the jury heard, this was a 'red . herring' designed to give the false impression he was a drug addict. Prosecutor William Clegg . Mr Clegg said that one possible motive for the killing was a plan to rob Mr Sly of benefits which were paid into his account each fortnight. Withdrawals had been made from Mr Sly's account while he was 'dead or dying' by somebody who had obtained his card and pin number. Police later identified that person as the defendant Smith, he added. After the alleged murder, Turner told a friend 'we've killed somebody', Mr Clegg said. He added that she explained how Mr Sly screamed in pain shouting 'help me, help me' as he was beaten and an ammonia-based cleaning product was sprayed in his face. Turner claimed she had been made to take part in the attack as the group forced Mr Sly to hand over his bank details, the court heard. Mr Clegg said attempts to cover up the attack suggested those responsible were 'forensically aware'. A pillow case had been placed over Mr Sly's head in an apparent attempt to prevent blood splattering across the flat during the attack. The trial is expected to last up to four weeks.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 11:02 EST, 4 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 01:16 EST, 5 October 2012 . The latest victim of what health officials are calling a 'rapidly evolving outbreak' of rare fungal meningitis was a dedicated child care worker who spent 20 years tending to a husband suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease. Diana Reed died on Wednesday afternoon at St Thomas Hospital in Nashville, Tennessee, surrounded by family members. Mrs Reed, 56, is one of thousands of patients recently treated in Tennessee hospitals for back pain with a steroid epidural - a fairly typical treatment. But since then a tainted batch of steroids released across the U.S. has been linked to dozens of cases of fungal meningitis. Scroll down for video . The caretaker: Diana Reed dedicated her life to helping underprivileged children before a routine medical procedure infected her with a rare fungal meningitis . The potential scope of the meningitis . outbreak that has killed at least five people widened dramatically as health officials warned that hundreds, perhaps thousands, of . patients who received steroid back injections in 23 states could be at . risk. Mrs Reed, of Brentwood, Tennessee, was the fifth person to succumb to the infection. A blog written by a close friend of Reed's family, Brandon Scott Thomas, characterized her as 'hilarious, beautiful, and full of life' and praised her for carrying for husband Wayne Reed after he was diagnosed with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - more commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease - almost 20 years ago. 'Over the course of the last week she has gone from someone brimming with life to someone in the process of passing from this life to the next,' wrote. 'Her brain couldn't take the stress. After a series of strokes they moved her to hospice care. Wayne, one of the longest surviving patients with ALS, there by her side.' Reed served on the board of her husband's namesake child care organization, the Wayne Reed Christian Child Care Center. Source: The outbreak of the deadly form of meningitis was traced to St Thomas Hospital in Nashville, Tennessee . The injectable steroids responsible . for Reed's death were produced by New England Compounding Center, a . specialized pharmacy in Framingham, Massachusetts. The company has shut down operations and said it is working with regulators to identify the source of the infection. It is not clear how many patients received tainted injections, or even whether everyone who got one will get sick. So far, 35 people in six states - Tennessee, Virginia, Maryland, Florida, North Carolina and Indiana - have contracted fungal meningitis, and five have died, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In an alarming indication that the outbreak . could get a lot bigger, Massachusetts health officials said the pharmacy . involved, the New England Compounding Center of Framingham, has . recalled three lots consisting of a total of 17,676 single-dose vials of . the steroid, preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate. No solicitors: Specialized pharmacy New England Compounding Center has hidden from the public as its steroids are linked to multiple deaths and critical infections . An unknown number of those vials reached 75 clinics and other facilities in 23 states between July and September, federal health officials said. Several hundred of the vials, maybe more, have been returned unused, one Massachusetts official said. However many other vials were used. At one clinic in Evansville, Indiana, more than 500 patients got shots from the suspect lots, officials said. At two clinics in Tennessee, more than 900 patients received them. The incubation period before symptoms appear is 28 days, and its almost certain more cases will be reported say health officials, who are now calling this a national health crisis. Tennessee: The initial outbreak site with a suspected 16 cases, two of whom are in critical condition. Three others have already died. North Carolina: The second state to report infection with one case found at an unidentified clinic. Florida: Only two cases have been reported but health officials fear more may come forward. Virginia: One person has died from fungal meningitis and three more cases are still being treated. Maryland: Seven medical clinics in Maryland pulled their stock of a questionable steroid after one person died and two more cases were reported. Unlike the more common viral and bacterial meningitis, fungal meningitis is not contagious. It is an inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms include a severe headache, nausea, fever, and dizziness. The first patients identified in Tennessee experienced slurred speech, and difficulty walking and urinating. The pharmacy voluntarily recalled three lots of the steroid Methylprednisolone Acetate on September 26 according to the FDA. The drug is primarily used to relieve back pain. The drug was administered to patients in their late 40s to early 80s. Tennessee's S. Thomas Hospital, ground zero for the outbreak with a suspected 15 cases as of Wednesday with two in critical condition, reported having 2,000 vials of the steroid in stock before the threat was discovered. 'Some are doing well and improving. Some are very ill - very, very . seriously ill and may die,' Tennessee health official Dr. David Reagan . said. In Tennessee alone roughly 1,000 people were administered the steroid. The link between the injections and the . meningitis was discovered by Tennessee physician April Pettit, who found . the initial cases were all people who'd recently received an epidural. Critical condition: Tennessee health official Dr. David Reagan says the infected are 'very, very seriously ill and may die' Officials are still investigating how the steroid resulted in fungal meningitis. New England Compounding Center released a statement promising to work with heath authorities to discover what happened. But company president and licensed pharmacist Barry J. Cadden has otherwise dodged interview requests and the company web site is down. An archived version of the site notes the company is licensed to distribute drugs in every U.S. state. New England Compounding Center is among the approximately 3,000 U.S. compounding pharmacies specializing in blending, liquefying, or combining medicines customized for patients unable to swallow tablets, require specific dosages, or who have allergies. Such companies are regulated by the . state boards of pharmacy that license them rather than facing the . broader regulations traditional drug companies deal with. Ground zero: The first patients of the fungal meningitis were reported at St. Thomas Hospital which had roughly 2,000 vials of a dangerous steroid on stock . The pharmacy has produced questionable products before. In 2006, New England Compounding Center was one of four companies ordered by the the Food and Drug Administration to cease producing a topical anesthetic cream that was found to cause 'grave reactions including seizures and irregular heartbeats.' The cream was the cause of two deaths, neither tied directly to New England Compounding Center. That same year the company was also cited for multiple violations of federal laws and regulations based on a 2004 review of its offices. They were charged with misbranding drugs prescribed for eye treatment, misbranding an anesthetic drug and failing to provide adequate directions for its use, and promoting the use of a cancer drug for an unapproved purpose. An FDA warning letter admonished the company that it was 'distributing an unapproved drug in violation' of federal regulations. In 2010 the company was sued by an Illinois firm that alleged New England Compounding Center illegally hacked its database violating the federal computer computer fraud and abuse act. The case was eventually settled.","Diana Reed, 56, was treated with standard steroid epidural for back pain .

Face-off: Denver, Mr Gore said, is five thousand feet above sea level and Mr Obama did not have the necessary time to adjust to the altitude . He went on to argue that while Mr Obama had just arrived, the Republican nominee Mitt Romney had been training in Denver. 'Romney did his debate prep in Denver,' Mr Gore said. 'Obama arrived in Denver at 2p.m. today, just a few hours before the debate started.' The amount of time either candidate spent in the elevated city can effect a speaker's performance, Mr Gore argued. Challenge: The amount of time eiter candidate spent in the elevated city can effect a speaker's performance, Mr Gore argued . 'When you go to five thousand feet, and . you only have a few hours to adjust...' he said, implying that Mr . Romney's extended period in Colorado's capital gave him an edge on the . President.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 05:12 EST, 5 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:21 EST, 5 October 2012 . Iain Lobban, head of GCHQ, said the security service should hire more eccentrics and socially awkward people . The head of the top secret intelligence gathering agency GCHQ has said more socially awkward people should be hired by the UK's security services. Iain Lobban, director of the Government . listening station in Cheltenham, said he did not like the term ‘eccentric’ - but said a wide range of skills was necessary if the agency was to be successful. He said the service should not dismiss talented people just because they do not conform to a certain social stereotype. He made the comments in a speech to mark . the centenary of the birth of Alan Turing, the Second World War . codebreaker and mathematical genius. Mr Turing killed himself in 1954, two years after being convicted of homosexuality, which was then a criminal offence. In 2009, then prime minister Gordon Brown apologised for the treatment and vilification that Turing received. Mr Lobban told an audience at Leeds University: ‘Turing was not an eccentric, unless you believe that there is only one way of being normal and to be otherwise is to be peculiar. Turing wasn’t eccentric: he was unique.’ He insisted that today’s security service needed more people like Turing. ‘I strongly believe [the] agency needs the widest range of skills possible if it is to be successful, and to deny itself talent just because the person with the talent doesn't conform to a social stereotype is to starve itself of what it needs to thrive,' he said. He added that the service should not allow preconceptions and stereotypes to ‘stifle innovation and agility’. He said: ‘I want to apply and exploit their talent: in return, I think it’s fair that I don’t need to tell them how to live their lives.' Enigma codebreaker Alan Turing committed suicide in 1954 after he was prosecuted for being a homosexual , then a criminal offence . Britain's secret listening station: The Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire . Turing is regarded as the godfather of the Enigma codebreaker team, which was based at Bletchley Park in Buckinghamshire in the 1940s. He also developed a machine which arguably became the model for the modern computer. He died aged 41 after taking cyanide as an alternative to jail following his prosecution for being a homosexual. Mr Loban said that if Turing was alive now, he would be working to secure the UK's interests in cyberspace. He said: ""We can't rewrite the past. We can't wish mid-twentieth century Britain into a different society with different attitudes. 'We can be glad that we live in a more tolerant age.

"PUBLISHED: . 06:45 EST, 5 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 07:46 EST, 5 October 2012 . A respected teacher who was sacked for drunkenness was today jailed for a boozy jaunt in a luxury Range Rover. Darren McCarthy, 39, of Walthamstow, London, was arrested after driving a friend’s £50,000 car in a drunken haze just moments after being found by police lying asleep and snoring on a pavement. He was said to be abusive to officers and refused to give a breath test when asked. Disgraced: Darren McCarthy leaving Macclesfield Magistrates Court in handcuffs. He was sentenced to eight weeks in prison for failure to provide an evidential sample of breath. Earlier this year McCarthy was dismissed from his job as a PE teacher at a school for children with behavioural problems after going on a boozing binge with the headmistress, during which he kissed and embraced her before they had a drunken bust-up inside a railway station. The father-of-two from Walthamstow, London has since been struggling to find work. At Macclesfield magistrates' court in Cheshire McCarthy looked shocked as he was jailed for ten weeks after admitting failing to provide a specimen of breath. He was also banned from driving for 30 months. His lawyer said he would appeal. The latest incident occurred at 3.25am on August 25 after McCarthy, who used to work at Barking and Dagenham Tuition Centre in Essex, had spent the night drinking while visiting a friend in the wealthy Cheshire village of Alderley Edge. Paul Davies, prosecuting, said police patrolmen spotted him lying on the floor outside the Natwest cash machine and went to tend to him because they were concerned for his welfare. 'He was snoring loudly and his phone and car keys and wallet had fallen out of his pocket,' said Mr Davies. Guilty: McCarthy outise court. He had previously been fired for a drunken altercation with headteacher Katrina Mann (right) 'He was taken by the shoulders and became conscious and the officers detected intoxicants and that he appeared to be drunk. 'Upon waking he was quite abusive towards the police officers and staggered off but returned when he realised his property had fallen out of his pocket. He collected the items without saying anything further.' Shortly afterwards the same officers saw a Range Rover Sport turn out towards them and spotted McCarthy at the wheel. 'Mr McCarthy was shocked when he was stopped and realised the officers were the same ones as before and said ""I refuse"" when asked to take a sample,' said Mr Davies. 'They consequently explained but he refused and he was arrested and he became very aggressive and argumentative.' The court heard McCarthy was in breach of a conditional discharge after being convicted of disorderly behavior following his bust up with the Katrina Mann, 48, outside Barking railway station in March. He was also in breach of a further conditional discharge for a separate offence of obstructing police. He also had a caution for common assault in 2007. Defending, Naomi Roberts said: 'He accepts that his recollection of this incident is hazy. He was staying at a friend’s house in Alderley Edge and had use of his vehicle. 'He drove to meet some friends and went into the bars and had a few drinks but had no intention of driving the vehicle. He took a taxi to Wilmslow and continued drinking and remembers going back to the address and falling asleep on the sofa and cannot remember anything else. 'He doesn’t have a good relationship with the police following incidents from earlier this year, but he accepts in hindsight that he should have provided a sample.' She added: 'He was a PE teacher and has been in the profession for 14 years but an incident at the beginning of this year led him to lose his job as a teacher, which had a profound affect on him. 'He went from having a well-respected profession to now actively seeking work. He was teaching pupils who were underprivileged and disadvantaged and they would look up to him and he was their role model. 'He knows he has let them down and also his family and friends and those who he has built up a relationship with. He wants to get back into teaching. 'Mr McCarthy accepts that he needs to make a change and fully accepts that and knows he has put himself in a very precarious position. He is fully remorseful for his actions.' Macclesfield Magistrates Court, where Price was sentenced. He was visiting friends in nearby Cheshire . But passing sentence chairman of the bench Mrs Monica Sim said: 'You were intoxicated and gave numerous refusals both at the roadside and in the custodial suite. This was an intentional refusal and you presented a very high risk to road users and pedestrians. 'We feel that this particular offence is enough to warrant a custodial sentence in order to punish, detract and deter others from this particular offence.' Last March McCarthy was in court after he got involved in a drunken row with Ms Mann. Witnesses called the police as the couple shouted and swore at each other. McCarthy yelled at officers, screaming 'why are you f***ing stopping me’' and saying they were only stopping him because he was a 'n*****.' while Mann retorted: 'Shut the f*** up, you p****, don’t say anything - you’re coming home with me.' It emerged they had been drinking at a nearby bar for more than six hours. The Barking and Dagenham Tuition Centre has been praised by Ofsted for being ‘extremely successful’ at getting previously disaffected students back into education.","Darren McCarthy failed to provide a breath test after he was stopped by police .

Professional fire-fighters who have fought blazes in the Channel Tunnel for the past 18 years are to be replaced by untrained security guards, it emerged today. It follows a breakdown in contract talks between Eurotunnel, which manages the undersea link, and the Pas-de-Calais fire service (SDIS). The company was trying to renegotiate a 2m pounds plus annual deal with SDIS but the French fire-fighters pulled out. Threat: A damaged Eurotunnel shuttle train following an a blaze in 1997. Contract talks between Eurotunnel and the Calais fire service have . broken down meaning firefighters are to be replaced by untrained . security guards . A Eurotunnel spokesman said they 'regretted' the SDIS decision, adding: 'We have never skimped on security and are looking for the best solutions to take over the SDIS work.' The last major fire in the Channel Tunnel was on September 11, 2008, when a blaze broke out on Eurotunnel shuttle train carrying a number of lorries and drivers. It lasted for 16 hours and reached temperatures of 1000 C, yet swift action by the Calais fire-fighters meant only 14 people out of 32 on the train suffered minor injuries, including smoke inhalation. Repairs to the tunnel cost more than £50 million, with new emergency warning measures introduced afterwards. There were two earlier blazes - the first in 1996, two years after the tunnel opened, and one in 2006. The Calais fire brigade has a base just 10 minutes from the French entrance to the Channel Tunnel, at Coquelles, with staff able to mobilise almost immediately. The last major fire in the tunnel, in 2008, lasted for 16 hours and reached temperatures of 1000 C, yet swift action by the Calais fire-fighters meant only 14 people out of 32 on the train suffered minor injuries . This was one of the main reasons that Eurotunnel has hired some 40 permanent fire-fighters at Coquelles for the past 18 years. 'These few minutes are crucial to dealing with any fire,' said a brigade source. 'We acted in seconds following the blaze in 2008.' Negotiations between Eurotunnel and the Calais brigade have taken place every two years, with Eurotunnel regularly praising their 'remarkable dedication and professionalism' Now Onet, a Marseille-based security company, is said to be ready to take over fire-fighting duties from the Calais brigade from January 1st. They have already begun advertising for staff, calling for men and women who are 'serious, calm and - ideally - have done some work as volunteer fire-fighters or five years in industrial fire prevention.' However, there is no expectation that any of the new guards will be professional fire-fighters.","Talks break down between Eurotunnel chiefs and the Calais fire service .

BBC Radio DJ Liz Kershaw is to lift the lid on the culture of sexual harassment at Radio 1 after sensationally revealing she was groped while broadcasting live for the station. Kershaw, 54, has been asked  to meet with George Entwistle, the corporation’s new director-general, after she told yesterday’s Today programme that a male colleague had repeatedly ‘fondled her breasts’ while she was on air. In an exclusive interview with The Mail on Sunday, the BBC Radio 6 Music presenter said she would name male contemporaries who had sex with Radio 1 and  Top Of The Pops fans as well as junior colleagues. 'Sexual antics': Liz Kershaw has said she will name male contemporaries who had sex with Radio 1 and Top Of The Pops fans . Sources say this information  is likely to include details of  an ‘unsuitable relationship’ involving the late John Peel and  a schoolgirl now in her 40s. Kershaw said: ‘I will be seeing Mr Entwistle and I will be telling him everything that I know. ‘I have been asked to see him because of the comments I made on Radio 4 yesterday. ‘I will be telling him about the sexual antics of other household names who had relationships with girls in the office or with people they met on Top Of The Pops or the Radio 1 show. ‘I should stress, however, those relationships did not involve underage girls.’ Liz Kershaw said Jimmy Savile's penchant for young girls was an 'open secret' at BBC Radio 1 . Kershaw last night refused to identify any of the personalities involved and insisted her primary motive was to help  the BBC following the wave of allegations about Jimmy Savile’s relationships with young girls. ‘I love the BBC and I want George Entwistle to be prepared for anything that might be coming, because it will come out. I think it’s best he hears it from someone who was on the spot.’ When the Today programme producers called her yesterday, Kershaw told them Savile’s penchant for young girls was  an open secret at Radio 1. She joined the station shortly after his departure but said colleagues constantly joked about the relationships. She said: ‘The rumours were there, the jokes were there and  it was an open secret. ‘With all the piety about him when he died last year I was rather sickened, and I thought “why don’t people say what he was really like”. The main jokes were about his adventures on the Radio 1 roadshow when they went around the country. ‘It was massive then. It was rather like the X Factor going around the country then. Can you imagine the X Factor judges rounding up the contestants and asking for sexual favours after the show? I don’t think so.’ Kershaw also revealed she was repeatedly groped by a colleague. She said: ‘There was one presenter who routinely groped me. I would be sitting in the studio with my headphones on and my back to the studio door.  I couldn’t hear a thing . . . then I’d find these wandering hands up my jumper, fondling my breasts. ‘I couldn’t say anything, I couldn’t even explain because  I was broadcasting to the nation.’Kershaw said her complaints to BBC managers fell on deaf ears. ‘When I complained, they were incredulous and said “Don’t you like it? Are you a lesbian?”Kershaw added: ‘When I walked into Radio 1, it was a culture I had never encountered before. It was like walking into a rugby club locker room, and it was very intimidating for a young woman.’","BBC Radio 6 DJ has said a male colleague repeatedly 'fondled her breasts' while she was on air .

An image of the genius who took physics to new heights is eerily manifested on the side of an Austrian mountain in this incredible image. The face, which appears on the side of Grimming Mountain in Steiermark, has an uncanny resemblance to Albert Einstein, the German-born physicist famous for developing the general theory of relativity and forever changing our understanding of the universe. Anyone viewing the mountain might expect to see nothing more than snowy slopes. However, a closer look shows what is actually there - an incredibly accurate profile of Einstein's famous face. Relative-ly similar: Grimming Mountain, in Steiermark, Austria, bears a striking resemblance to genius Albert Einstein . Ironically, Einstein, who is also famous for the Theory of Brownian Motion, Unified Field Theory and his work on the Manhattan project which led to America developing the atom bomb, was a citizen of Austria from 1911-1912. In 1921 he won the Nobel Prize for physics and was so famous that in the period before World War II he would be stopped on the street by people wanting him to explain the theory of relativity. His ingenious way of handling it was to apologise and explain that he just happened to look like the great man. He died in Princeton, New Jersey in 1955 at the age of 76. Soaring intellect: Here we see the uncannily similar peak set against an azure sky . The mountain is similar to Mount Rushmore National Memorial, a sculpture carved into the granite face of Mount Rushmore near Keystone, South Dakota, in the United States. Sculpted by Danish-American Gutzon Borglum and his son, Lincoln Borglum, Mount Rushmore features 60-foot sculptures of the heads of former United States presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln.","Incredible image shows mountain's uncanny resemblance to Albert Einstein .

Two men who attacked a former solider because he was wearing a badge honouring fallen servicemen have been sentenced to two years behind bars. Tattoo faced Peter Hislop and Dean Connor called victim Carl Hicks a scumbag, hit him with a bottle and stamped on him as he lay helpless on the floor of a night club in Exeter. The unprovoked attack, which resulted in Mr Hicks needing 22 stitches in head wounds, started after the two men asked Mr Hicks about his badge and he replied that he had kept it on from a Remembrance service. Terry Holder, prosecuting, said witnesses saw both defendants punching . and kicking Mr Hicks in the EX4 club in the centre of Exeter. One witness reported seeing Mr Hislop balancing with one hand on . the bar as he stamped on his head. Mr . Hicks suffered three large cuts to his head and a smaller one on his . shoulder, as well as two black eyes and severe facial bruising. Mr Hislop, a 23-year-old bouncer, from Cockwood in Devon, and Mr Connor, 22, a digger driver from Exeter, admitted causing grievous bodily harm to 34-year-old Mr Hicks. They were both jailed for two years by Judge Francis Gilbert, QC, at Exeter Crown Court. He told them: 'You attacked a man who was on his own in a night club and once he was on the ground you kicked and stamped on him, causing wounds to his head that required multiple stitches. 'He was a stranger to both of you. Hislop noticed a badge and asked him what it was and he said it was a . veteran’s badge which he wore because he had been in the army.

'He . is still suffering the effects and it is very fortunate you did not . cause more serious injury. Stamping is a vile and vicious way to attack . someone, which can cause fatal injuries. 'That is what you did. It was quite deliberate and repeated. There was no justification for it. You used your shoes as weapons.' Mr Edward Bailey and Mr David Evans, defending, said they did not have any animosity against former soldiers or the army and the attack had resulted from an argument at the club.

Bridger, who had a closely shaved . head and goatee beard, cried to himself as he spoke to confirm his name, . age and address. He also confirmed he understood the charges. He appeared on the verge of tears throughout the hearing, which lasted around four minutes. He was remanded in custody and will next appear at Caernarfon Crown Court on Wednesday. Minutes earlier, about 100 people lined the streets, shouting abuse and heckling as Bridger's security van swept into a secure court car park.

The devastating blow for the Jones family came at the end of the sixth full day of searching for her. Superintendent John said: 'We have to prepare for the time when we accept that we might never find April. 'But we are optimistic that the work we are doing is going to give us the best possible chance.' He said there was no official cut off point for the search.

Graeme admits he only rekindled a passion for photography in the last five years having worked most of his life in post-production on animations and films.

'I’ve always had a fascination with the derelict and often tried to photograph it but I find that these scenes allow me to get across what I couldn’t out in reality.

A man accused of stabbing his ex-lover to death in her apartment has called for a witch doctor to take the stand in his defense to prove he was under an African curse that forced him to kill. Bakary Camara, originally from Senegal, goes on trial on Tuesday for the brutal slaying of Italian student Rita Morelli, 36, inside her New York City apartment in November last year. He has called for a witch doctor to stand as an expert witness in the trial - a bizarre move which prosecutors have branded 'clearly irrelevant' as they fight against it. Killed: Bakary Camara, the man accused of killing Rita Morelli (pictured) last year, has requested a witch doctor take the stand as an expert witness to prove he was under a curse that made him kill . 'It is difficult to imagine how a witch doctor could be qualified in a court of law,' lead prosecutor Evan Krutoy wrote to the judge last week, the New York Post reported. 'The defense cannot credibly argue that witchcraft is a profession [with] scientific knowledge or skill.' The judge has yet to respond to the request, but defense lawyer Seema Iyer confirmed to the Post she is reaching out to the city's West African community to find a 'spiritual advisor'. Camara is accused of slashing Morelli's throat and stabbing her multiple times on November 23 last year. Her body was discovered by her live-in boyfriend. Victim: Morelli, 36, met Camara at a designer clothing store where they both worked in New York City and began a relationship. She was living with a new boyfriend when she was found murdered . Workplace: They met at this clothes shop, where Camara was a security guard and Morelli worked in sales . Morelli, who was a student at Hunter College and a waitress at Caffee Buon Gusto in New York, had been living in the city for five years, pursuing 'the American Dream,' her family said. Camara had met his victim in 2010 while he worked as a security guard in a designer clothing store,  7 For All Mankind, where she worked in sales. In a rambling, four-page letter found in his pocket during his arrest in the days after the murder, Camara claimed a curse had pushed him to kill. 'They put a curse on me,' the father of two, who was born in the U.S. but raised in Senegal, wrote. 'They make you do . anythings. Could make you die fast or go to jail. You always be mad . and sad. This is a curs. 'There is something in my mind tell me . you have to do this you have to anything bad make thing bad thing hurt . people. I always think to make a suicide but I . can’t.

A naked rambler has won a long battle to overturn his conviction for causing distress to a female dog walker who said she saw his genitals. Naturist Nigel Keer, 42, will now be continuing his nude hiking - once the weather warms up - after a panel of judges gave a list of reasons to quash his conviction. Mr Keer appealed after magistrates found him guilty of the public order offence of causing distress to the woman as she walked her dog at a beauty spot called Otley Chevin, West Yorkshire, last October. Overturned: Naturist Nigel Keer, 42, will now be . continuing his nude hiking - once the weather warms up - after a panel . of judges gave a list of reasons to quash his conviction for causing distress to a female dog walker . The decision comes just two days after a man known as The Naked Rambler was released from serving his latest prison sentence. Stephen Gough celebrated his freedom by taking a hike in his birthday suit through nearby Peebles. The 53-year-old was jailed for five months after he was arrested in July for being naked near a play-park in Dunfermline. Meanwhile, a judge at Leeds Crown Court told Mr Keer that his charge would be dismissed because the panel considered it unlikely that Mr Keer’s naked walk had caused any alarm. The court had heard that Mr Keer was arrested by off-duty police officer PC Mark Buxton, who said he saw a woman appear 'distressed' when she had noticed Mr Keer rambling in just his hiking boots on October 2 last year. Relieved: Bus driver Mr Keer, of Leeds, West Yorkshire, had denied the distress claims, and said naturism 'is about body freedom' Sitting with two justices on Monday, Judge Guy Kearl said PC Buxton, who said he had been shocked by the incident, would not have been able to determine if the woman was distressed. Dismissing the charges, he added: 'This behaviour was not carried out in front of a school or in the street in a town centre. It took place on moorland in broad daylight. 'In view of the location of this incident, the time of day and the reaction of others as we have found it to be, we do not consider that anyone was likely to be harassed by this behaviour or intimidated or distressed.' The judge said there were no sexual motives behind the incident, adding: 'He was not deliberately flaunting himself or seeking attention or jumping out and doing what is colloquially called flashing.' He said that the police officer’s reaction to seeing Mr Keer could also be considered 'extreme given his experience.' Bus driver Mr Keer, of Leeds, West Yorkshire, had denied the claims, and said naturism 'is about body freedom and in a way it is a mild protest against the expected social norms of wearing clothes every day'. Speaking after the case, Mr Keer said that he was delighted to have finally fought off the charge, which had kept him out of work for a number of months. He added: 'I’ve kept up the naturism, but I’ve been a bit more careful now. It’s a bit cold to be doing anything at the moment, but once the weather warms up, I’ll be back out there.' Mr Keer has previously taken part in three naked world bike rides alongside other naturists. He had first become interested after being sent a letter from British Naturism in 2004. He initially thought it was a prank but he went on a naked swim anyway, leading to his love affair. He has even put it on his CV as an interest. Naked: Stephen Gough was jailed for five months after he was arrested in July for being naked near a play park . When the case first came to court last October, he said: 'I must admit that I was surprised when it came to court. 'I don’t feel I have committed an offence or distressed anyone. People are a lot more accepting now than they were five or six years ago. On the whole, most people are quite happy with it. 'I love walking about naked. It’s the feeling of being at one with nature and a feeling of liberation.

American taxpayers will shell out up to $16,000 to replace Abu Hamza al-Masri's hook hands. The Egyptian-born radical Islamic hate preacher, who claims his hands were blown off while fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan, was stripped of his prosthetic limbs 'for security reasons' when he was extradited to the United States from Britain on Friday. He has demanded the return of his prosthesis, including his infamous hook, so that he can feed and clean himself. In this courtroom sketch, radical Islamist preacher Abu Hamza al-Masri (R) appears before before US Magistrate Judge Frank Maas (L) in Federal Court in New York . The Federal Court in New York, left, where Hamza, sketched right in court, appeared on Saturday . American officials told the New York Post that they will likely oblige Al-Masri in order to avoid charges that he was deprived of his civil rights, which could form the grounds for legal appeal. However, he's getting a pair of prosthetic hands -- and not hooks. Officials said there was 'no way' al-Masri, who was convicted in Britain of inciting murder, hatred and terrorism, would get his hooks back while in the US. 'The rule is you give the guy what they had before. Not anything better,' an anonymous official told the Post. Officials with the prosthetic limb maker Arimed said even basic replacement hands must be custom fitted and cost between $5,000 and $8,000 each. More advanced prosthesis can cost up to $100,000. Al-Masri, 54, faces charges that he conspired with Seattle men to set up a terrorist training camp in Oregon in 1999 and 2000 and helped abduct 16 hostages, two of them American tourists, in Yemen in 1998. Civil right? Al-Masri says he need his hook to clean and feed himself and taking it away is a violation of his civil liberties . Dangerous: Experts say a metal hook like al-Masri's could easily be used as a weapon in prison . Al-Masri, indicted under the name Mustafa Kamel Mustafa with al-Masri . listed as an alias, became well known in the 1990s as his Finsbury Park . Mosque in London became a training ground for extremist Islamists . including September 11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui and 'shoe bomber' Richard Reid. He had been jailed since 2004 in Britain on separate . charges. Two other men extradited alongside Al-Masri, Khaled al-Fawwaz and Adel Abdul Bary, will appear in U.S. District Court in Manhattan for the first time on Tuesday. They face charges that they participated in the bombings of embassies in Tanzania and Kenya in August 1998. The attacks killed 224 people, including 12 Americans. They were indicted in a case that also charged Osama bin Laden. Both pleaded not guilty on Saturday. Al-Masri has unusual needs in prison after losing part of each of his arms in what he says was a fight against the Soviets in Afghanistan. He also is missing an eye. His lawyers in England said he suffers from depression, chronic sleep deprivation, diabetes and other ailments. The Gulfstream aircraft believed to contain Cleric Abu Hamza takes off from RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk just hours after he lost his final legal fight to remain in Britain . A Gulfstream aircraft at US airbase RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk shortly before it flew the cleric to the US . His court-appointed lawyer, Sabrina Shroff, said on Saturday that he needed the use of his arms and wanted his prosthetics back. 'Otherwise, he will not be able to function in a civilized manner,' she said. John N Billock, head of the Orthotics & Prosthetics Rehabilitation Engineering Centre in Warren, Ohio, and a pioneer in the field, said a hook for a hand would 'definitely be considered a weapon.' 'You could brutalize somebody with it,' he said. 'You can put somebody's eyes out or knock out their teeth.' Al-Masri is being held prior to trial in the same federal lockup where a prison guard lost an eye and was left brain damaged when he was stabbed with a sharpened comb in 2000 by a terrorism defendant awaiting trial in the embassy bombings plot. Mamdouh Mahmud Salim is serving a life sentence after pleading guilty in the stabbing.","Prosthetic limbs removed 'for security reasons' when he was transferred to U.S. from Britain on Friday .

The explosion caused Maenza to instantly lose both his legs and to suffer deep gashes, burns and nerve damage to his arms in addition to nasal and skull fractures. Technically dying in the field, the quick actions of a medic ensured that Maenza was resuscitated, after which he was rushed to a military hospital in Germany where he began an 18-month rehabilitation process. However, despite surviving the explosion, Maenza entered into a deep depression. 'You don’t know where you’re going to go – you just know you lost your legs and emotionally, mentally, life’s over,' said Maenza to Fox News. 'There’s nothing to live for.'

Maenza, from Nashville, Tennessee, had not yet completed a full month of his deployment working as a combat engineer in the Marine Corps, when he lost his legs in a horrific accident . Stuck in a terrible rut for six-months, Maenza started to pull through after he had a religious experience. 'I had a divine intervention with God,' said Maenza. 'This wasn’t what my life was going to be like. Losing my legs was not going to determine who I was going to be. 'I died – they had to bring me back to life – I got this second chance, and I wasn’t going to settle for mediocrity.' It was while hospitalised at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, Maenza was introduced to representatives from Achilles International, an organisation which helps people with extreme disabilities compete in mainstream athletics. 'Achilles came in and said, 'Hey, we don't feel sorry for you because we know you can do better than this, you are not just a patient in this hospital, you are an athlete; you are a competitor,' said Maenza.

The non-profit organisation was founded in 1983 and funds the Freedom Team of Wounded Veterans - and encouraged Maenza to compete in two marathons and to cycle across the nation from Florida to California. 'It was exactly what I needed at that point in my recovery,' said the injured veteran to WKRN. 'I was at a crossroads. They came in and gave me a way to get a sense of accomplishment. 'It gives you something to work towards, the knowledge that you are capable and you can do it.' 'I never really was a runner or a cyclist before, but when Achilles approached me and asked me to do it, it kind of lit a fire in me and, quite frankly, I’m pretty good at it.' Ben Maenza still keeps in contact with his U.S. Marine Corp friends - and is pictured here with two in the gym . Despite finishing the race in under two hours, Maenza was not totally happy with his performance. 'Obviously, I was a little slower than I intended, but I’ve got a good excuse, my wheel was broken,' said Maenza. 'Now I’m going to continue to train harder and push to the limit. I can use it as motivation for my next race.' Now studying for a college degree, Maenza takes inspiration from his progress over the past two years. 'The message is, with the right attitude and determination, you can succeed anything that’s put in your way,' said Maenza. 'Life’s not over if you lost your legs, or you have diabetes, or you’re overweight, whatever. 'No matter what you’re faced with, you can do great things.  I just want people to know if we can do it, they can do it.'","Lance Cpl.

Convicted child molester Jerry Sandusky will be allowed to keep the more than $900,000 he earned in state pension payments in spite of his recent sentencing of 30 to 60 years in prison. Because of the bylaws of the Pennsylvania state employee's retirement system, the former football coach will keep the hundreds of thousands of dollars he earned following his 1999 retirement from Penn State University's sports program. The state's forfeiture law does not authorize the government body to go after money paid before the date of a plea or conviction, meaning he will keep everything awarded between 1999 and September 2012. Payments stopped: Jerry Sandusky will be allowed to keep the more than $900,000 he earned in state pension payments in spite of his recent sentencing of 30 to 60 years in prison . That said, the agency notified Sandusky he will no longer continue to receive the payments, which amount to $59,000 annually. Sandusky's lawyer says the former Penn State assistant football coach will fight to keep his pension. The decision to revoke his pension- which breaks down to $4,908 per month- was unveiled in a letter to Sandusky, 68, dated October 9. That was the same day he was sentenced in Pennsylvania Common Pleas Court to prison for 30 to 60 years for molesting 10 boys. The move by SERS, a state retirement plan for public employees, means Sandusky loses his entire pension, including a sum to his wife Dottie when he dies, according to the letter first published by the Centre Daily Times of State College, Pennsylvania, where Penn State, a public university, is located. Dottie, who was mentioned in the court case as one of the victims said that he screamed during the abuse because he knew that Mrs Sandusky was in the home, came back into the spotlight this week as she and her husband co-signed a letter to the judge slamming their own adopted son Matt. Support: Wife Dottie Sandusky also wrote a letter accusing the couple's adopted son Matt - who said he too had been abused - of being a thief and a liar . In an extraordinary display of denial, the Sanduskys said they were victims of a mass conspiracy in letters to the judge at the Centre County courts in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, revealed today. Sandusky began working for Penn State's football program under the late and legendary coach Joe Paterno in 1969. Sandusky is credited with creating, during the 1980s and '90s, the fearsome defensive squads that earned the school its reputation as Linebacker U. But his reputation crumbled when the Pennsylvania Attorney General's office released a grand jury report in November 2011 that resulted in criminal charges against him for sexually abusing 10 boys over 15 years. Shifting blame: The 69-year-old, pictured with Penn State University team in 1999, claimed his victims were troubled liars from unstable homes . Sandusky was convicted in June on 45 counts of sex abuse, and sentenced on Tuesday to spend, in all likelihood, the rest of his life behind bars. As the scandal unfolded in November 2011, Paterno and university president Graham Spanier were fired. Paterno, 85, died in January of lung cancer. Penn State pension payments to Paterno's widow, Sue, are calculated to top $13million. Jerry Sandusky to Judge John Cleland, September 27I spent many hours reliving this ordeal. I looked at me, my vulnerability, my naivety (some say stupidity), and my trust in people.There were so many people involved in the orchestration of this conviction (media, investigators, prosecutors, 'the system', Penn State, and the accusers). It was well done. They won!What would be the outcome if all the accusers and their families who were investigated? All their issues would surface. They would no longer be these poor, innocent people as portrayed. I have been blamed for all of their failures and shortcomings... Nobody mentioned the impact of abandonment, neglect, abuse, insecurity and conflicting messages that the biological parents might have had in this.A common reaction for those with low self-esteem is to blame others.Instead of walls, I saw great memories: I saw all the people who thrived with a little of our help and hope, I saw a locker room with people hugging and crying as national champs, I saw me throwing thousands of kids up in the air and them asking for more.Dorothy Sandusky to Judge Cleland, July 9People need to know what kind of person [Matt] is. We have forgiven him many times for all he has done to our family, thinking that he was changing his life, but he would always go back to his stealing and lies. He has been diagnose (sic) with Bipolar, but he refuses to take his medicine. He has had many run-ins with the law and stolen money and items from our family. We still love him and want the best for him, but because of his actions we cannot express this to him.I use [sic] to believe in our protective system, but now have no faith in the police or legal system. To think that they can lie and get by with the lies. The press has been unbelievable. People who have not met us are writing untruths.Many times [Jerry] would give up his free time to make a sporting event of one of the kids he was trying to help. sometimes we would drive for two hours to spend time with these kids.","Former football coach earned more than $900,000 in pension payments from 1999 to September 2012 because of his coaching job at Penn State .

A modest funeral was held today for China's oldest known sex slave, who worked for the Japanese army during World War II. Yin Yulin died at the age of 91 last week and the low-profile send-off took place in her hometown of Zhengjiazhai village, Taiyuan, capital of northern China's Shanxi Province. After Yin was identified 17 years ago as one of the Japanese army sex slaves known as 'Comfort Women', she went to Japan twice, testifying as a victim, but both court verdicts refused to accept her claims . Troubled history: Yin Yulin, China's oldest known sex slave for the Japanese army during WWII, has now died . Time to act: Various organisations have called on the Japanese government to acknowledge its responsibility for what happened, open a full investigation and provide redress from official sources rather than the so-called Private Fund . Unheard: Yin testified in Japan twice about what happened after her identity was discovered 17 years ago, but both verdicts denied the history . Zhang Shuangbin, a school teacher . investigating the history of comfort women, said that as more former . forced prostitutes die, lawsuits against the Japanese government become more difficult. Various organisations have called on the Japanese government to acknowledge its responsibility for what happened, open a full investigation and provide redress from official sources rather than the so-called Private Fund. Some of the girls forced into sexual slavery were as young as 12 years old, according to Chinese legal groups. Conflicted thoughts: Yin holds a picture of her with friends. Some are concerned lawsuits against the Japanese government will become increasingly difficult as more former sex workers die . Shocking: Girls as young as 12 were forced to provide sex for soldiers at 'comfort stations' across Asia Pacific . After the war, many of the women were brutally slaughtered and their story was first told in 1991. 'Comfort woman' is a translation of the Japanese euphemism, jugun ianfu, (military comfort women), referring to women of various ethnic and national backgrounds and social circumstances who became sex slaves for the Japanese troops before and during WWII. Military brothels existed across the Asia Pacific region in areas occupied by the Japanese forces. There is no way to determine precisely how many women were forced to serve as comfort women, but estimates range from 80,000 to 200,000, of whom about 80 per cent of whom are thought to have been Korean. Japanese women and women of other occupied territories (such as Taiwan, the Philippines, Indonesia, Burma and the Pacific islands) were also used as comfort women, according to a report by San Francisco State University. We'll never forget: Former comfort women at a weekly rally by the Japanese embassy in Seoul, South Korea . Painful past: A South Korean woman cries during a protest rally at the Japanese embassy in Seoul, where demonstrators demanded compensation and punishment for soldiers who abused women . Shameful truth: Filipino comfort women light candles in front of the Japanese embassy during a rally in Pasay City . Refusing to be silenced: Filipino comfort women and their supporters react after riot police tried to disperse them during a rally near the presidential palace in Manila in 2005 . The authorities believed the comfort system would enhance the morale of the military and help prevent soldiers from committing sexual violence toward women of occupied territories, which became a real concern after the infamous Nanjing Massacre in 1937. They were also concerned with the health of the troops, which prompted close supervision of the hygienic conditions in the comfort stations to help keep STDs under control. When the war ended, the only military tribunal concerning the sexual abuse of comfort women took place in Batavia (now Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia) in 1948. Lifelong dream: Six Taiwanese ex-comfort women wear wedding dresses for the first time in 2006 . Several Japanese military officers were convicted for having forced the 35 Dutch women involved in the case into comfort stations. The issue began to emerge in Korea only in the late 1980s. The Japanese government admitted deception, coercion and official involvement in the recruitment of comfort women in August 1993, but critics said they needed to go much further.

British lawyer Roger Stokes, 49, who died on Sunday morning after being found covered in blood at his flat in Yemen . A lawyer has died in mysterious circumstances at his home in Yemen. Roger Stokes, formerly of Gosforth in Newcastle, died on Sunday morning after being found injured in his flat. Mr Stokes, who lived alone in the southern city of Aden, had just moved . into a flat overlooking the harbour because it . was 'secure'. Mr Stokes' sister, Helen Williams, said they do not yet know how the 49-year-old came to be injured. His death on October 7 is being investigated by local authorities, but it is understood a cause of death has not yet been recorded. Helen, who grew up with her brother in Heworth, Gateshead, 46 said: 'Roger's driver had gone to collect him from his flat for work on Sunday morning. 'He tried for half-an-hour to raise him and when Roger finally came to the door, he was bleeding badly from his head. 'The driver called an ambulance but, out there, it takes a long time for them to come. 'We understand Roger was unconscious by the time it arrived. 'He was alive when they put him in the ambulance, but died on the way to hospital.' Family members are unable to fly to Yemen as the Foreign Office in London advise against travel to the troubled country. Yemen, which is bordered by Saudi Arabia and Oman, was the scene of a revolution last year which led to the long-term president Ali Abdullah Saleh's ousting. The Foreign Office describes the country as 'volatile' and Helen said the family had feared for her brother's safety as fighting broke out. When police arrived at her home in Berkshire, Helen initially feared Roger had been attacked. She said: 'Now it seems as though it was just an awful accident. 'It appears his flat was still secure. It was locked from the inside.' Sira, close to the city of Aden where Roger Stokes died: The lawyer was found with blood pouring from his head . Roger's aunt June Thompson, of Ponteland, Northumberland, said: 'His employer said there was no indication of foul play, but it is still unclear. 'It is so horrible to think of.' The former pupil of the King's School in Tynemouth read economics and law at Newcastle University and also had a qualification from Northumbria University. He worked on Tyneside for a small solicitors' firm and then for Newcastle P&I, before his work took him around the globe. He moved to Yemen around 15 years ago when Sheikh Tariq Abdullah offered him a job at his company, one of the oldest and most prestigious in Yemen. Dealing mainly in shipping, oil and commerce, Roger was the only British lawyer in his office. Helen said: 'He was such a laid-back character, he was almost the ideal person to live in a country which was being ripped apart around him. 'The sheikh has told us that he and all his family are completely devastated. 'Roger wasn't just an employee, he was like a part of their family.' Roger would try to get home two or three times a year. Annually, he brought over entrants for the English Speaking Union's International Public Speaking Competition. Roger's family have asked Sheikh Abdullah to arrange for him to be buried in Yemen. But they plan to arrange a memorial service in the UK and want to get in touch with all Roger's friends and colleagues.","Roger Stokes had lived in the country for 15 years and was 'part of the family' at prestigious law firm .

The planned sale of 316 Royal Bank of Scotland branches to rival Santander collapsed last night in a ‘major blow’ to the state-backed lender. Troubled RBS – 83 per cent owned by the taxpayer after a £45billion bailout – has been working on the deal for two years as it battles to recover from the banking crisis. But Spanish buyer Santander has pulled the plug, blaming the poor quality of RBS’s IT systems, which crashed over the summer. Setback: Stephen Hester hailed the deal to sell branches 'an important milestone' The collapse of the £1.65billion deal . is another setback for RBS chief executive Stephen Hester, who has been . forced to sacrifice his bonus for the past two years. The bank is also braced for a large . penalty for its involvement in the Libor rate-rigging scandal that saw . rival Barclays fined £290million. When the deal to sell the 316 branches was agreed in 2010, Mr Hester hailed it as ‘an important milestone in our restructuring’. The disposals were ordered by the European Commission in return for the UK government’s rescue of RBS in 2008. Sources said the bank is confident a new deal can be reached before the EU deadline at the end of next year. Other potential buyers include Sir . Richard Branson’s Virgin Money – which took over Northern Rock – Tesco, . NBNK and Co-operative Bank, which recently bought more than 600 branches . from Lloyds Banking Group. It is thought RBS may even spin the branches off as a separate company and list them on the London Stock Exchange. 'Major blow': Spanish bank Santander pulled out on the deal to buy the branches, blaming RBS' poor quality IT systems . The collapse will throw into confusion the bank transfers of some 1.8million RBS customers. However a source insisted it was ‘business as usual’. Any customer already issued with a . credit or debit card or account number under the Santander brand will be . able to carry on using them as an existing customer of RBS, the bank . promised last night. It said it is ‘determined that the decision will have no impact on the service available to customers’. Mr Hester said: ‘I can assure all . affected customers that there will be no disruption to the service they . receive. It is business as usual in all of these branches, and customers . don’t need to take any action.’ He went on: ‘While this is a . profitable part of our business that we would rather not part with, RBS . has worked hard to ensure it is substantially separate from our UK . branch network and corporate business and largely ready to be taken on . by a new owner. Much of the heavy lifting associated . with a transfer has already been completed, including separating data . for customers and putting in place a standalone management team. ‘It is of course disappointing that . Santander decided to pull out of this transaction, especially for the . customers and staff involved. ‘However, RBS’s strong progress in our . restructuring plans means we can continue to provide a stable home for . this business and its customers pending a further resolution. RBS will . commence a new process of disposal and will provide a further update in . due course.’ The proposed deal, which involved the . sale of 310 RBS branches in England and Wales and six  NatWest branches . in Scotland, has been fraught with problems and delays. The major sticking point has been the . compatibility of the RBS accounts with Santander’s computer systems. The . bank has a poor record in moving other banks’ customer to its own IT . system.

Pravartika Gupta, 25, and 13-month-old Idika were attacked at their home in Delhi's Sarojini Nagar neighbourhood in a dispute over a dowry payment. Mrs Gupta died in the city's Safdarjung hospital on Sunday morning, eight days after the attack which left her daughter with 55 per cent burns. Innocent victims: Pravartika Gupta (left) died and her 13-month-old daughter Idika suffered extensive burns after her husband and father-in-law set them on fire as they slept at their Delhi home . The technology graduate managed to make a statement to a magistrate shortly before she succumbed to her injuries. She said they were asleep in bed on October 6,when a fire broke out in front of their bedroom door and nobody came to help. Both her husband Ashutosh Gupta and father-in-law Ram Mohan Gupta are now on the run after police announced they would be charged with murder, attempted murder and making illegal dowry demands. Her father-in-law suffered minor burns in the blaze, but discharged himself from hospital before police could arrest him. Mrs Gupta's father Kshamveer, a doctor, told detectives that her in-laws were were torturing her both mentally and physically over a dowry demand of £11,700. In India, female children are often regarded as a burden because tradition requires large dowry fees to be paid to the other family when they are married. The country has among the highest female infant mortality rates in the world. The ratio in the 2011 census was 914 girls for every 1,000 boys, in comparison to 950 girls for every 1,000 boys worldwide. Female infanticide has been widespread in India for generations. In 1870, the British colonial government passed a law to ban it, but with little effect. Girls must be married off. And to achieve that a daughter's parents usually have to pay the groom's family a dowry of cash and gifts - often a massive burden on the parents' savings and income. Boys are also likely to provide more of an income than girls. Dowries were outlawed in 1961, but the practice is still common and the law all-but ignored. The arrival of ultrasound technology in the 1980s, which made it possible to determine the sex of a foetus, made sex selection much easier. Doctors were banned from revealing the sex of a foetus in 1994, but only one doctor has ever been prosecuted for doing so. A senior police officer told . HindustanTimes.com: 'Her father alleged that the accused family members . had demanded £11,700 as dowry from him. The harassment continued even as . he paid £7,050 in cash to Pravartika's in-laws. 'We have arrested the victim's mother-in-law, but her husband and father-in-law are still at large.'Mrs Gupta's uncles have claimed that her husband was also angry with her because he had wanted their first child to be a boy. One uncle, Rajesh Gupta, told the Daily Telegraph that Pravartika had wed Ashutosh Gupta two years ago after both families agreed a dowry payment. This was to include a £15,000 payment and Honda City car to the groom's parents. But he claimed they then demanded a new apartment, despite her parents having spent £15,000 on the wedding and handed over £11,700 in cash. Rajesh Gupta said: 'They said they had given a flat to their daughter's in-laws in dowry and we should do the same. They are economically well-off, but greedy. 'We bought gold and clothes for them on the baby's first birthday but they were not satisfied. A flat would cost between £35,000 and £117,000. 'They said you are not as good as we are. You must be proud to be our relatives and you must pay.' He added: 'Why did he do this? He had everything - a beautiful wife, a beautiful girl, a prosperous house. What was in his mind we don't understand.'","Pravartika Gupta and 13-month-old Idika were attacked at their Delhi home .

"By . Ray Massey, Transport Editor . PUBLISHED: . 07:37 EST, 17 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 14:07 EST, 17 October 2012 . Gatwick Airport bosses flew into a storm with protesters today when they announced plans for a controversial second runway at Britain’s second biggest airport. It could double capacity at the West Sussex airport to 70million. It currently handles 34million passengers a year flying to 200 destinations in 90 countries. Under a legal agreement made in 1979, the airport cannot build a second runway before 2019 – and decision makers at Gatwick insist they will honour that agreement. Gatwick's future? If these proposals for a second runway are approved, the number of annual flights at the airport will soar from 250,000 to 500,000 . Twice the flights: Gatwick's capacity could double to 70million if the plans are approved. Protesters say the second runway will hit the region's infrastructure hard . But after that all bets are off and Gatwick bosses say they are beginning detailed work now on the option for an additional new runway, which could be built in the next decade. They say a second runway at Gatwick is a better option to boost Britain’s aviation than a third runway at Heathrow, the expansion of Stansted or a multi-billion ‘Boris Island’ option of a new airport in the middle of the Thames Estuary, as favoured by  London Mayor Boris Johnson and others. But the Gatwick Area Conservation Campaign (GACC) has blasted the plans - and claimed the announcement was being made to drive up the value of the airport's owners. GACC chairman Brendon Sewill said: 'We have always been . totally opposed to a new runway on environmental grounds, and have had . massive support from across Surrey, Sussex and west Kent. 'We have been supported by all the local MPs and all the county, . district and parish councils in a wide area. 'If necessary, we will . resume the battle. We will fight it all the way. We’ve done so before. We will do so again.' Brendon Sewill of the Gatwick Area Conservation Campaign has vowed to fight the second runway. Villagers in nearby Charlwood fear environmental damage, heavier traffic, more noise and plummeting house prices . The GACC also released a statement . that said: ‘We stand ready, if need be, to launch a massive campaign to . defeat any new runway plan, as we have defeated such plans in the past. 'It . would mean twice as many planes in the sky, twice the noise, twice the . local pollution, twice the number of airport-related cars, and twice the . climate change damage. Twice as many airport workers would need twice . as many houses.' Alternative: Gatwick claims the plan is a superior option to proposed expansion at Heathrow or Stansted or a new site in central London . Gatwick was owned by Heathrow operator . BAA until it sold the Sussex airport in December 2009 for £1.5billion to . the consortium Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) – owners of London . City Airport – following a highly critical report by the Competition . Commission attacking BAA’s dominance in the South East. The . Gatwick second runway option will be submitted as part of a . 'masterplan' to the Government-appointed aviation commission, led by . former Financial Services Authority (FSA) chief Sir Howard Davies, which . will make its full report in summer 2015. Gatwick chief executive Stewart . Wingate defended the plan, saying a new runway at the airport could be . 'affordable and practical' and was a better option than new runways at . Heathrow or Stansted. He confirmed that a second runway would double passenger numbers to 70,000 and annual flights from 250,000 to 500,000. It would take four to five years from . August 2019 to build the second runway and associated terminal . buildings – meaning the earliest it could open would be about 2023. Mr Wingate told the Daily Mail that . GIP, which owns 42 per cent of Gatwick, had been ‘quite clear’ when it . bought the airport three years ago that it would keep its holding for a . limited period of between five and 10 years before selling. That could take it up to 2019 when work on a new runway could begin. Mr Wingate said: ’This was a decision by all the shareholders for the long-term interests of Gatwick.’ Plans for the future will evaluate various runway options and assess key requirements, including environmental, surface access and economic impacts. It will also look at environmental issues including noise and air quality impacts on local communities. Gatwick chiefs believe that the additional capacity, flexibility and 'resilience', or the ability to operate without long delays and cancellations caused by lack of staff or poor weather, that could be provided by a new runway at Gatwick will help to ensure that London's airports provide south-east England and the UK with the connectivity needed. Gatwick Airport is the UK’s second largest airport and the busiest single-runway airport in the world. It serves around 200 destinations in 90 countries for around 34 million passengers a year on short- and long-haul point-to-point services. A second runway would double passenger number to around 70million a year. Gatwick generates around 23,000 airport jobs and a further 13,000 jobs through related activities. The airport is 28 miles south of London and owned by a group of international investment funds, of which Global Infrastructure Partners is the largest shareholder. Gatwick serves more destinations than any other UK airport flying to 197 destinations compared with 163 destinations from Heathrow (Source: OAG data). It is the UK’s largest short haul airport serving 145 destinations, excluding UK, compared with 73 destinations from Heathrow (Source: based on peak week summer 12 OAF scheduled data). It is the UK’s largest domestic airport serving 12 destinations compared with seven destinations from Heathrow (Source: based on peak week summer 12 OAF scheduled data). A 1979 legal agreement with West Sussex Council prohibits Gatwick from constructing a new runway before 2019. The Government’s failure to consider Gatwick's expansion a decade ago because of this agreement forced ministers to re-run a previous consultation on airport expansion following a legal challenge. Gatwick was owned by Heathrow operator BAA until it sold the Sussex airport in December 2009 for £1.5billion to the consortium Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) – owners of London City Airport – following a highly critical report by the Competition Commission attacking BAA’s dominance in the South East. Gatwick is built on the site of an ancient manor house which became home to a racecourse in the 19th century. In the late 1920s land next to the racecourse was used as an aerodrome and in the 1930s became home to the Surrey Aero Club. In 1933: The Air Ministry approved commercial flights from Gatwick. Bosses said that at least for the rest of this decade, London's airports will be relying on their existing physical capacity. Gatwick's submission to the Davies Commission will also include a detailed evaluation of how Gatwick's existing single runway capacity can be maximised to contribute to the short-term capacity needs for London and the UK. Mr Wingate said: 'I believe a new runway at Gatwick could be affordable, practical and give passengers a greater choice of routes to key markets. 'A new runway will allow Gatwick to compete and grow, increasing the choice available to passengers today. We have the space, capability and access to financial resources.' He noted: 'Over the last three years we have transformed the airport, invested around £650 million and have a strong track record for delivering key routes to growth markets. 'However, we must now look to the future when Gatwick will become full and outline its long-term role in ensuring London has an efficient and resilient airport system that creates the crucial connectivity London and the UK needs.' He insisted: 'There are clear practical advantages of a new runway at Gatwick. When compared with a third runway at Heathrow, we would have a significantly lower environmental impact whilst adding significantly more capacity. 'Stansted is half empty today, we already have much better surface transport links and feel our business case will be much stronger.' Taking a swipe at the 'Boris Island' options for the Thames Estuary Mr Wingate noted: 'As for the Estuary airport there are major questions on affordability, environmental issues and whether they are deliverable. 'The process of evaluating the runway options will be complex. I am committed to undertaking a comprehensive and in-depth assessment that considers not only the economic benefits but also the environmental impacts. We will be consulting with our key stakeholders throughout the process.' A statement from Gatwick Airport insisted: 'Our submission to the Commission will be consistent with Gatwick’s commitment to the 1979 legal agreement with West Sussex Council. That agreement prohibits Gatwick from constructing a new runway before 2019.' The Government’s failure to consider . Gatwick expansion a decade ago because of this agreement forced . ministers to re-run a previous consultation on airport expansion . following a legal challenge. Baroness Jo Valentine, chief executive of London First, also praised the plans. She said: ‘Anything that could increase runway capacity at London’s airports is good news for passengers and for the UK economy. 'If the UK is going to remain a competitive economy, we need more flights to growing and emerging markets. This announcement from London Gatwick broadens the debate on how we can achieve that and offers the potential for further competition and greater choice for passengers.' Officials at Heathrow Airport added there voice to those objecting to the second runway. A . spokesman said: 'The UK is not short of the point to point capacity . provided by airports like Gatwick – there is already plenty of spare . point to point capacity at Stansted, Birmingham and Luton. 'What . the UK is short of is hub airport capacity. Hub airports use transfer . passengers to pool demand from different countries – and all the . evidence suggests this is the only way to support the frequent and . direct long haul routes that are vital to business and trade.' Fears: People living near the airport are worried that they will be forced to move, but aviation bosses say the plans are practical . Major scheme: Gatwick is the UK's second largest airport and the busiest single-runway airport in the world .","Bosses announce plans for second runway, which could be built after 2019 .

Police have launched a murder probe over a vet who disappeared from her home. Catherine Gowing, 37, was last seen alive on Friday evening, leaving the practice where she worked in Mold, North Wales. Officers were alerted when she failed to turn up for work on Monday morning, having also missed an appointment over the weekend. The following day they arrested a 46-year-old local man on suspicion of her murder and launched a major inquiry into the vet’s disappearance. Miss Gowing’s sister, Emma, said her family were devastated by the disappearance. ‘She is the light of our family and we can’t imagine that light gone,’ she added. Miss Gowing’s elderly parents, John and Maureen, who are both in their 80s, were being comforted by friends and relatives at the family farm in Clonlee Clareen, Birr, Offaly. Her uncle, Edward Gowing, also a vet, said the family had been told by police that there was little chance of Miss Gowing being found safe and well. He added: ‘To say we are in shock is an understatement. ‘We have been told that it is a murder investigation. Catherine was a very bubbly, outgoing person. 'She was a great social mixer and had lots of friends.’ He said his niece was passionate about her career as a vet and was very academic. Prior . to qualifying as a vet in Budapest, Hungary, two years ago, she worked . in food science having obtained a degree from Dublin City University. But Mr Gowing said it was her intention was to return to Ireland and take over the family farm. Investigation: Police teams search the home of missing vet Catherine Gowing in New Brighton near Mold, north Wales . Sensitive operation: Forensic officers in white overalls arrive at Miss Gowing's home to take photographs and search for clues . Her uncle added: ‘She is two years working as a vet. She loved it and loved living in Wales. But her real passion was farming. ‘She was going to come back here at Christmas and most likely take over the family farm. She loved nature and farming. She was a very independent minded woman. Everyone speaks highly of her.’ Horse breeder Jean Walker said: . ‘Catherine was a lovely person who came out to see to one of my ponies. She was very professional.’ Inquiry: A forensic expert in white overalls consults a community support officer at Miss Gowing's home near Mold, North Wales . Miss Gowing is the youngest of two girls in the family. Her elder sister, Emma, and brother-in-law, Shay, travelled to Wales yesterday to help police with their inquiry. Mr Gowing said officers were alerted on Monday when Miss Gowing failed to turn up at work. They discovered her Irish registered car was missing, but a 4x4 she used for work was on the drive with the keys inside and her house was open. It is understood flatmate Miss Doyle, who is from Robinstown, in Meath, was away in Ireland for the weekend. Mr Gowing said the family have been told that the man in custody was known to his niece and may have had access to the house - although he was not in a relationship with the single vet. Miss Gowing, originally from Birr, County Offaly, in the Republic of Ireland, lived with her flatmate and fellow Irish vet, Jane Doyle, 37, in a modern semi-detached house in New Brighton, near Mold. The £150,000 property, in a quiet cul-de-sac, is owned by the DE Evans Veterinary Surgery, where both women worked. Yesterday the house was sealed off by police and scenes of crime officers were scouring the inside for clues. Officers have appealed for information on the location of Miss Gowing’s burgundy Renault Clio, which has Irish plates, and has also been missing since last week. Detective Superintendent John Hanson, of North Wales police, said he feared Miss Gowing may have come to ‘some significant harm.’ Standing guard: Community support officers keep watch outside Miss Gowing's home as the investigation into her disappearance continues . Murder probe: North Wales police officers fear Miss Gowing may have come to 'some significant harm' ‘We are increasingly concerned about Catherine’s welfare and have no knowledge as to her current whereabouts,’ he said. ‘This is totally out of character for Catherine who maintains regular contact with her family, friends and work colleagues and I fear she may have come to some significant harm.’ Det Supt Hanson said the man arrested was known to Miss Gowing, but refused to elaborate any more on whether they were in a relationship, friends or mere acquaintances. Neighbours described Miss Gowing as a ‘lovely girl’. Search: Police are trying to trace Miss Gowing's Renault Clio, bearing an Irish registration plate, which is also missing from her home . Michelle Shaw, who lives nearby, said she last saw Miss Gowing when she went to work on Friday morning. ‘Catherine looked after my horses and was always a very pleasant woman,’ she said. ‘She was really nice and would always help anyone. ‘I used to have a bit of a joke and laugh with her, it’s just so sad. ‘It’s such a shock because it’s so quiet round here and she’s such a pleasant, open and happy woman.’ Sighting: Miss Gowing was last seen leaving the veterinary practice where she worked in Mold . Mrs Shaw said the two women rarely had any visitors. ‘I never saw a boyfriend or anything like that,’ she added. ‘On Friday night my daughter noticed that the Renault Clio which has been reported missing wasn’t on her drive. ‘That was strange because she only ever used her work car unless she was going on holiday. ‘I’m praying and hoping the police find her and she’s safe. ‘People of her age don’t just disappear, and why anyone would want to hurt her is beyond me.’ Another neighbour, Elizabeth Purcell, said Miss Gowing was a ‘quiet and friendly woman.’ ‘She was a very quiet girl, very nice,’ Mrs Purcell said. ‘She was absolutely lovely with my dog and we’re just very, very upset.’ Photographer Hadyn Iball, a long-term customer of Miss Gowing’s surgery, described her as ‘compassionate’ and ‘personable.’ ‘We always found her to be an excellent vet, very thorough and extremely personable,’ he said. ‘We are very sad to hear this news and our thoughts and sympathies go out to her family at this time.’ No-one from the veterinary surgery would comment on Miss Gowing’s disappearance.

Usman Yasin, 30, pictured laughing as he attended an earlier court appearance, has been released from jail on unconditional bail while he awaits the verdict of his appeal . A driver who was jailed for beating up an elderly woman who told him to watch his language has been freed on bail after serving just five days. Usman Yasin, 30, received a 16-week sentence after being found guilty of hitting 81-year-old Patricia Pearson after she covered his mouth to stop him swearing at her for driving too slowly. The disabled pensioner suffered horrific injuries during the attack in June this year and told the police the the ordeal had left her feeling 'vulnerable'. But now she is outraged after her attacker, who has lodged an appeal against his conviction, was granted unconditional bail while he awaits the verdict. Mrs Pearson said: 'I’m really fuming about the whole thing - it beggars belief. It is a farce and the law in this country is nothing but an ass.' Mrs Pearson, a former school cleaner from Birkenhead, said her attacker’s release on unconditional bail - which means there are no restrictions on his freedom - was ‘an absolute disgrace’. Yasin was jailed on October 10 after Burton Magistrates’ Court heard he hit Mrs Pearson due to her alleged slow driving. The victim sustained injuries including a cut on her forehead and top lip, and grazes to her face, cheek and elbow following the incident in Burton-Upon-Trent, Staffordshire. Mrs Pearson said she still suffered pain in her lips and neck, as well as psychological trauma and Magistrates dismissed Yasin’s claim of self-defence. However, following a hearing at Stafford Crown Court, Yasin lodged an application for bail as part of his appeal and it was granted. Mrs Pearson added: 'Who pays for this? The people of Burton. It’s beyond belief, it really is. Patricia Pearson, 81,  suffered horrific injuries in the attack as she drove to visit her husband at a care home . Brutal: Mrs Pearson had a gash in her forehead and cuts and grazes on her body . 'If he gets off I will get myself a lawyer. He’s not going to get away with it. There’s no way. 'All I want is justice.' The court had previously heard that the fast food delivery driver had become incensed when he became stuck behind Mrs Pearson - who had been driving to visit her husband in a care home. He pulled in front of her and braked sharply, before Mrs Pearson got out her car and approached the passenger side of his Peugeot 206. All Saints road in Burton, Staffordshire, where the road rage incident took place . Mrs Pearson, pictured, was subjected to a barrage of abuse by Yasin when she got out of her car. Mrs Pearson leaned in to cover Yasin’s mouth to stop him using foul language towards her, causing him to lash out. Prosecutor Michael Taylor earlier said: 'The defendant called her a ‘stupid f***ing bitch’ and ‘an old cow’. Magistrates previously dismissed Yasin's claim of self-defence . 'She was incensed by it and leaned in to the car, leaned forward and put the palm of her hand to his face, mouth and nose.'She said ""mind your language"". 'A witness saw him deliver a back-handed slap to Mrs Pearson which appeared to connect with considerable force. 'Her glasses were thrown 15-20 feet down the road. She then felt two scratches down her face which started bleeding.' Speaking since the application for appeal, Yasin's solicitor, Ifran Mohammed, confirmed that the defendant had ordered a legal challenge against his conviction and sentence. 'He’s instructed us to appeal and we believe there are grounds to appeal,' he said. 'The conviction was against the weight of the evidence adduced. There was more than reasonable doubt. 'A lot of the witnesses were in his favour, including one of the Crown’s. Another said he did not witness any assault.' Mr Mohammed said Yasin also thought a jail term was ‘excessive’ because he was person of good character. Asked what he would say to those who criticised his client’s appeal and release on unconditional bail, the solicitor said: 'We went through the legal process. 'He was found guilty, which we respect and understand, but he’s also got a right to appeal if he does not believe in the court’s decision. He’s exercised that right. 'We are sorry Mrs Pearson was injured but we believe there are grounds for appeal.' Depending on the outcome of the appeal, Yasin could return to prison.

A former singer last night claimed she had a relationship with Jimmy Savile that spanned almost two decades - and even secretly aborted his baby. Donna Foot, 50, of Leatherhead, Surrey, said they had a secret fling after the late Top of the Pops presenter flattered her outside BBC studios - but she had no idea that he was a paedophile. The mother of two revealed she felt physically sick to remember how she had almost given birth to Savile’s love child - and was pleased she eventually went through with the abortion. Former couple: Donna Foot (left), 50, of Leatherhead, Surrey, said she had a secret fling for 17 years after the presenter Jimmy Savile (right) flattered her outside BBC studios - but she had no idea that he was a paedophile . She said: ‘I'm absolutely disgusted, as you can imagine. He was a total conman, he conned everyone. Now I'm thinking “you should have picked up on it”. I'm disgusted. I feel betrayed.’ Mrs Foot, who claimed to have had a 17-year relationship with Savile, added that she was ‘so glad’ she didn’t give birth to his child ‘because they would have to be dealing with all his shame now’. She also chillingly claimed Savile that told her that he would never marry or have any sons or daughters because ‘the best thing about other people’s children is that you can give them back’. Mrs Foot told how she had met Savile outside BBC Radio One in the early 1980s, while she was waiting for singer Cliff Richard - only to bump into the famous DJ on his way to work. She had written to Savile as an eight-year-old for his Jim'll Fixit Show and admits she was instantly enamoured upon meeting him while in her early 20s, after noticing him on the way into Radio One. Mrs Foot said: ‘He started saying to me “Blondie, Blondie - give me your hand”. I said that I was waiting to see Cliff Richard and he said “if you are here when I come out, I will get you a poster”. Past times: Mrs Foot in her 20s (left) and a signed calender from Savile is pictured (right), calling her 'DoDo' ‘I was there when he came back and he said ""I'm going up to my apartment"" and asked me to go. I couldn't believe it was true. We went to the apartment and he wanted to take my number. ‘He was asking about my singing and was . saying he could help me. He was talking about Cilla Black and he said he . was in with Tom Jones. I was on cloud nine. I was star struck.’ 'I'm absolutely disgusted, as you can imagine. He was a total conman, he conned everyone. Now I'm thinking “you should have picked up on it”. I'm disgusted. I feel betrayed' Donna Foot . She claimed Savile said he would take her to ‘sit on the bean bags’ at the Jim'll Fix It studio, and arranged for them to meet again at his flat, before they took a taxi to the BBC. Mrs Foot said that when she visited the studio, Savile would make her give code words to get past security guards and would not want to pose for photographs with her. She claimed he would call her ‘Do-Do’, and signed memorabilia from his radio and TV shows for her but banned her from telling people about their courtship. Mrs Foot said that she now wanted to burn all of her signed items and her only remaining photograph of the pair together which was taken on the day that she first met Savile. Today: Mrs Foot, 50, is a mother-of-two married to her husband Nigel and lives in Leatherhead, Surrey . ‘When I think back he was very flirty with all the girls,’ she said. ‘There wasn't one girl who went past without him getting hold of them or kissing him, and would act like he wanted to go further. ‘He would always kiss my hand and when he got hold of you he would push his groin into you.’ 'He would get me on the bed, he would look me in the eye - eye contact was the first thing - then he would put his hand on my leg and started rubbing me' Donna Foot . She later became intimate with Savile - with their relationship lasting until 1999. Mrs Foot said she had even become pregnant by Savile in 1999 but had aborted the child without telling him. Their relationship ended soon after, she said.

Dramatic change: Jeanette Fidler is pictured here in 2002 (left) and nearly a decade later in 2011 . The transformation came after she . stayed clean for ten months and underwent an eight-week treatment . programme while in jail awaiting sentence on theft charges. Fidler stole tens of thousands of . pounds worth of valuables from lockers at gyms and hotel health clubs in . northern England to buy drugs after losing her job as a recruitment . manager. She conned staff into handing over keys or broke in to steal cash, credit cards, mobile phones and jewellery. Yesterday she narrowly avoided jail when a judge showed mercy despite her admission of 12 thefts and 174 previous convictions. Judge Bernard Lever heard that she has . stopped taking heroin, completed the drug rehabilitation programme and plans to train as a beauty therapist. Reformed: The judge spared Jeanette Fidler jail after hearing she had kicked her drug habit . ‘You have committed more of these . offences than I’ve had hot dinners,’ he said. ‘You have been a . one-person crimewave going round these leisure centres and rifling . people’s property. ‘Why on earth should people have to . put up with this? My natural inclination would be to jail you for a very . long time, but you have been on this new programme and are determined . to address your drug use. ‘I am going to give you the chance to demonstrate that you are committed to turning your life around.’ The judge did, however, ban her from . every gym and health club in Britain for four years as part of an Anti .

The . defendant became annoyed and said, “Are you accusing me” and the witness . had the courage to say, “Yes”.’ Fidler, who has two teenage sons, was . chased out of the gym and escaped in a hire car with four mobile phones . worth £1,900, plus £285 in cash and a debit card. Two days earlier, she had crept into . the female changing rooms at The Waterside Hotel and Leisure Centre in . Didsbury, Greater  Manchester, breaking into five lockers and stealing . £210 in cash. Fidler committed the offences after being released early on licence from a previous jail term for theft. Scene: The Village Hotel in Hyde, Cheshire, where Jeanette Fidler broke into lockers .

According to new research, meerkats enhance their intelligence through nine different social and asocial mechanisms. The meerkat is an extremely social animal, living in tightknit . colonies of between 20 and 30 individuals who make their homes in vast . networks of tunnels. What really makes these animals stand . out is their intelligent coordinated behaviour, which rivals that of chimps, . baboons, dolphins and even humans in its complexity and efficiency. One of the terms given to a group of meerkats is a 'mob' A team led by William Hoppitt . of the University of St. Andrews  presented wild meerkats with a novel . foraging task to investigate the animal's learning mechanisms. They then applied a unique model to study how the meerkats went about the task. 'The model deals with the rate at which individuals interact with the task, solve the task once they are interacting with it, or give up on the task when they are manipulating it,' said Hoppitt. 'It allows us to ask whether these things are affected by previous experience manipulating the task and observing others.' They found that the meerkats engaged in a . wide variety of social and asocial behaviours to learn to solve the . task, and that in general the social factors helped draw the meerkats . into the task, while the asocial processes helped them actually solve . the task. 'Meerkats that have solved the task in the past are more likely to interact with it, give up on it less quickly, and be quicker to solve the task once they have started interacting with it,' said Hoppitt. 'They also become faster at solving the task as they have unsuccessful attempts, suggesting they learn from their mistakes. 'However, at the same time it appears that very successful meerkats give up on the task sooner, and very unsuccessful meerkats persist for longer, suggesting simply that meerkats try harder when they are hungrier,' he continued. 'We find that meerkats that see others solving the task interact with the task more, and persist for longer in trying to solve it: they seem to learn by observation that it is possible to get into the box to get the food.' Based on these results, the team propose a new model for characterising social learning mechanisms in the field. The model may also be more broadly applicable and can be used to investigate the relationship between social learning mechanisms and so-called 'behavioural traditions' that together can constitute a culture. 'At the moment we plan to apply the methods to groups of monkeys and birds, but might try an experiment on human participants at some stage in the future,' said Hoppitt. The full report is published in the open access journal PLOS ONE.

One of the firms believed to be making the screen for Apple's new iPhone is struggling with manufacturing problems, it has emerged. The gadget, expected to be revealed at an event on September 12 in San Francisco, is believed to have a larger, thinner screen that uses less power, boosting the handset's battery life. Some reports claim it could give a boost of up to 40 per cent. Apple CEO Tim Cook is expected to unveil the new iPhone on September 12th. It is expected to have a larger screen - but today it emerged one of the key suppliers is behind schedule on making them . The next iPhone is expected to use in-cell LCD panels, a new technology that makes the smartphone's screen thinner by integrating touch sensors into the LCD, eliminating the need for a separate touch-screen layer. However, in-cell panels are believed to be technologically more difficult to mass produce compared than conventional LCD panels. However, today it emerged Sharp has fallen behind schedule on production of screens. It is believed the Japanese display maker is struggling with high costs that have cut into its margins on the screens. It has also blamed 'manufacturing problems' on the delay, according to the Wall street Journal. The source, who is familiar with Sharp's production operations, did not give an indication of how far behind the output had fallen. The source spoke on condition that he not be identified because of the sensitive nature of the disclosure. Sharp President Takashi Okuda said on August 2 that his company would begin mass production and shipments from its Kameyama LCD plant in central Japan this month. The facility is widely known to make screens for Apple, but Sharp has declined to acknowledge that Apple is a customer. Kameyama 'is operational,' Sharp spokeswoman Miyuki Nakayama said, without giving details of either output or shipment levels. Sharp is believed to be having 'manufacturing difficulties' making screen for the new iPhone, which could impact on its availability. The gadget is expected to be launched on the 12th September. Apple, which is also using other suppliers such as Japan Display and South Korea's LG Display Co for displays, is believed to be planning a major product launch on September 12. That has raised expectations the latest iPhone model will be in stores soon. The new iPhone screens will be thinner than previous versions with the use of so-called in-cell panels. The new technology embeds touch sensors into the liquid crystal display, eliminating the touch-screen layer found in current iPhones. Sources earlier told Reuters that the panels will extend 4 inches corner to corner -- 30 percent bigger than current iPhones. Sharp's shares slid 13 percent on Friday to 198 yen as uncertainty swirled around talks with Hon Hai Precision Industry for the Taiwanese company to buy a 9.9 percent stake in its fellow Apple supplier.","Handset expected to use radical 'in cell' four inch screen that could boost battery life by up to 40% .

Britain’s £600 million fruit industry is on high alert - after a tiny Asian fruit fly that devastates crops was found for the first time in this country. Growers of soft fruits like strawberries, raspberries, blackberries and blueberries are being warned the pest is probably already attacking crops here. The spotted wing vinegar fly is just 2-3mm long but can also pose a threat to harder fruit like apples and pears. The tiny Asian fruit fly - the spotted wing vinegar fly known as drosophila suzukii - devastates soft fruit crops. It has been found in Kent. The particularly nasty pest wrecked £300 million worth of crops in California alone the first year it was discovered there. Five flies were found in raspberry and blackberry plots at fruit trial centre East Malling Research in Kent earlier this month. But experts warn that the pest, which is rife in continental Europe, North America and Asia, is probably already widespread here too. In many countries it is suspected that the fly arrived up to three years before damage was first seen in crops. Once established, the pesky insect has proven impossible to eradicate and growers are being urged to look out for infestations. Other fruit at risk include blackcurrants, redcurrants, gooseberries, cherries, peaches, nectarines, plums, grapes and tomatoes. Unlike common fruit flies that attack rotting fruit, the spotted wing also attacks developing fruits on the plant. Britain's £600m fruit industry is on red alert after the pest was spotted in Kent. It has proved impossible to eradicate elsewhere in the world. The fruit is quickly spoiled as the female bores through its skin to lay eggs. When they hatch, maggots gnaw through the rest of the fruit and it falls, wasted, to the ground. Females can lay up to 60 eggs per day and 13 generations of the insect can hatch in a single year. Dr Michelle Fountain, an entomologist at East Malling, said: 'The trouble with this species is it’ll lay its eggs when the fruit is actually ripening, so obviously that has massive consequences for the fruit. 'There could be punnets with larvae in and you might not know they are there.' The fly, known as drosophila suzukii, originated in south-east Asia but reached the US in 2008, Italy in 2009 and Canada, Russia, France and Spain in 2010. Adult flies are brownish-yellow with black bands on the abdomen, up to 3mm long with bright red eyes. The fly is easy to spot due to its red eyes and black bands on its body . With distinctive red eyes, the insects are easy to spot. Dr Fountain said that the flies have had a 'massive impact' on grower practices in affected countries. They have had to spray crops with pesticides more often and wait longer before harvesting. The Horticultural Development Company, which advises fruit growers, has put out a briefing note warning them about the grim discovery at East Malling. It said: 'Adult flies have been identified both in wild blackberry and raspberry breeding plots on site. 'Spotted wing drosphila is an aggressive pest of berry and stone fruits. 'Experience in North America and Europe has shown it spreads very rapidly both in commercial crops and in wild hosts, especially wild blackberry. The flies are often used in experiments because they breed so quickly . 'It is therefore very probably widespread in the UK and already attacking vulnerable crops, though the extent of its spread is currently unknown. 'It is vital that routine weekly monitoring of berry fruit crops at risk - especially raspberry, blackberry and blueberry - is started as soon as possible. 'Monitoring for both larvae and adults is recommended but monitoring for larvae is crucially important to avoid the risk of infested fruit being sent to market. The fly, known as drosophila suzukii, . originated in south-east Asia but reached the US in 2008, Italy in 2009 . and Canada, Russia, France and Spain in 2010. Adult flies are brownish-yellow with black bands on the abdomen, up to 3mm long with bright red eyes. Females can lay up to 60 eggs per day and 13 generations of the insect can hatch in a single year. 'In the event that the pest is found, a programme of weekly sprays should be implemented as soon as possible.' The Government’s Food & Environment Research Agency (Fera) admitted that drastic measures like quarantine areas and compulsory destruction of crops have been ruled out. Fera’s Richard Mcintosh said: 'Once the pest is here, eradication would be impossible as the flies breed and spread very quickly. 'Very stringent statutory requirements on growers like destruction of crops would be needed, which would be seen as disproportionate and so eradication is not a realistic prospect.' In the US, growers suffered losses of up to 80 per cent of their crops depending on location and fruit. The Californian fruit industry lost £300 million due to pest damage in 2008, the first year it was seen in the state. Robert Pascall grows strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, apples, pears and plums for supply to the major supermarket chains. His 250-hectare Clock House Farm in Coxheath, Kent, is close to where the flies were found. He said: 'We should be concerned, though so far it’s an unknown quantity. 'We will try to keep the crops clean, so as not to leave them open to infestation, and take all the advice we can from the experts. 'Industry body British Summer Fruits represents suppliers of around 90 per cent of all berries supplied to the UK’s leading supermarkets. The BSF’s Nicholas Marston said: 'There is absolutely no need for consumers to be alarmed, Spotted Wing Drosophila does not pose any food safety risk or any risk to consumer’s health. 'The Horticulture Development Council and our growers have been and will continue to be vigilant in monitoring evidence of its existence. 'A great deal has been learnt from the US on monitoring, chemical control and hygiene which is being communicated to the industry and it is possible to control it effectively.'","Tiny insect could decimate fruit industry, affecting everything from strawberries to apples .

Scientists have discovered a keen sense of taste boosts immunity - a breakthrough that could lead to nasal sprays to ward off illness. People who find some vegetables, such as sprouts and broccoli, unbearably bitter are better at fighting off bugs due to chemicals in their nose, a study shows. Experiments found they have more receptors that pick up the flavour of these foods - and also work as an early warning system about bacterial invaders. Hating sprouts could actually mean you get ill less often, researchers have found. They say a third of people have a 'supertaster' gene that makes sprouts taste bitter - but mean they can fight infection. They were traditionally thought to be located only on the tongue but are now known to be in the linings of the nasal and sinus cavities as well. And these receptors are involved in activating the body’s natural defences against common infections. However, almost a third of the population do not have the specific version of the bitter taste receptor gene called TAS2R38 that activates an immune response. Dr Noam Cohen, of the University of Pennsylvania in the United States, said: 'If you are a supertaster, it is going to be very rare you are going to get sinusitis.' But he added this bitter-tasting ability does not protect against all infections. The findings, published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation, could lead to better treatments for chronic rinosinusitis, a condition of constantly inflamed and swollen sinuses which affects up to one in ten people. Bitterness is the most sensitive of the tastes, and many find it unpleasant, sharp or disagreeable. Common bitter foods also include marmalade, olives, citrus peel and wild chicory. In the study the researchers grew cells in lab dishes, forming structures that resembled the multilayered lining of the nose and sinus, to test out how bitter receptors affect the initial stages of the infection process. Chemicals produced by common bacteria called Pseudomonas aeruginosa activated the TAS2R38 bitter receptor, and caused the hair-like cilia that line the sinuses to start sweeping away microbial intruders. The activation also resulted in the release into the sinuses of nitric oxide which kills bacteria. The researchers looked at just one of 25 bitter receptors and it remains to be seen if the others affect the immune system. In the past researchers have used phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) to identify people with functional bitter receptors. A bunch of purple sprouting broccoli. Researchers have found that those who find it unbearably bitter may posses a gene that helps them fight off infection. Those who can taste the chemical are classified as supertasters, . The researchers said people who would say Brussel sprouts taste bitter are likely to be supertasters, having responsive bitter receptors. The study also suggests supertasters may have a higher risk of chronic sinusitis, and that non-tasters have more upper respiratory infections. Upon testing nasal tissue samples from patients who had undergone surgery related to sinus problems, the researchers found none of the eleven supertasters had Pseudomonas bacteria in their tissues, whereas seven out of twenty non-tasters had infections. Dr Thomas Finger, an expert in taste and smell at the University of Colorado, reviewed the research and said it could lead to an almost cost free test to distinguish supertasters from the more susceptible non-tasters. He said certain bitter compounds could also be used to activate the immune system. For example, a bitter nasal spray could be used to ward off an infection in the early stages. But such potential therapies are a long way off. Dr Cohen said his researchers will next look at whether genetics plays a role in people’s responses to sinusitis treatments.","Bitter taste receptor gene TAS2R38 found to activate an immune response .

If aliens from outer space visited our planet, they might be surprised to find that we excrete waste through our genitals - which, of course, also have a vital use in reproduction. However, the Chinese soft-shell turtle has evolved to use a very different orifice to rid itself of waste . Most usually encountered at upmarket restaurants in China, where they are considered a delicacy, these unusual amphibians are the only animals known to urinate through their mouths. Wash your mouth out! The Chinese soft-shelled turtle is the only animal known to science that actually urinates through its mouth . Now scientists believe that this apparently unique ability helped the animals adapt to survive in swamps and marshes where the water is often brackish - that is, slightly salty. Scientists in the 19th Century discovered that the linings of the mouths of soft-shelled turtles are covered with tiny, finger-shaped protrusions. Subsequent research revealed that these allow the turtles to breathe underwater by increasing the surface area of the mouth where oxygen and carbon dioxide can be exchanged. But Alex Yuen Kwong Ip of the National . University of Singapore believes that these characteristics evolved for . one reason only: to help the turtles urinate through their mouths more . easily. Here are some other Chinese delicacies that might seem odd to Western diners: . Together with Shit Fun Chew of Singapore's Nanyang Technological University, Professor Ip kept four turtles in tanks of water for six days, New Scientist reported. Each animal had a tube attached to its cloaca, the posterior opening where amphibians usually excrete both urine and faeces, so Professor Ip could keep tabs on what emerged. The researchers found that, incredibly, only 6 per cent of the turtle's urea came out of the cloaca, with the rest mysteriously turning up in the tank's water. Professor Ip also restrained the turtles on land. He found that when he placed a bucket of water in front of them the creatures plunged their heads in for between 20 and 100 minutes. Observing more closely, he watched as they held some water in their mouths for a while then spat it out, increasing the concentration of the urea in the water. Delicacy: Chinese soft-shelled turtles are farmed across South East Asia, where they are considered a delicacy and are often served in upmarket restaurants . Professors Ip and Chew found that proteins in the turtle's mouth lining help to transport urea from its bloodstream. They managed to isolate on such protein and found it was only present in the mouth and not the kidney. 'I know of no other animal that can excrete urea through the mouth,' Professor Ip was quoted by New Scientist as saying. Most fish excrete through their gills, and lungfish and some amphibians can do so through their skin, but the Chinese soft-shelled turtle's oral excretion is almost certainly a one-off. Professor Ip believes oral urination helped the turtles adapt to life in brackish waters. To excrete urea via their kidneys and through their cloaca they would need to drink a lot of water to flush it through. That would mean consuming a lot of salt, which would be difficult for them to get rid of. So instead of drinking the backish water, the turtles are able to simply rinse their mouths with it.","Chinese soft-shelled turtle is the only creature to excrete through its mouth .

Simpson was shockingly acquitted of murdering his ex-wife and her friend. But now a district attorney at the centre of the case has alleged that Simpson’s lead defence lawyer tampered with a crucial piece of evidence – one of the infamous gloves that prosecutors said linked Simpson to the grisly double-murder of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman. After The Juice struggled to fit the gloves on his hands – in one of the defining moments of the racially charged trial that captivated the nation – Cochran famously admonished the jury: 'If it doesn't fit, you must acquit.' Scroll down for video . Trial run: In the sensational 1995 murder trial, O.J. Simpson tries on a leather glove allegedly used in the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman . Former Los Angeles deputy district attorney Christopher Darden on Thursday accused Simpson defence lawyer, the late Johnnie Cochran, of 'manipulating' the glove, Reuters reported. New allegations: Prosecutor Christopher Darden, pictured at the 1995 trial, now alleges that Simpson's lead defence attorney tampered with the leather gloves . On Thursday, during a panel discussion about the trial at Pace Law School in New York City, Darden, a member of the prosecution team, declared: 'I think Johnnie tore the lining. 'There were some additional tears in the lining so that O.J.'s fingers couldn't go all the way up into the glove.' Darden said in a follow-up interview on Friday that he noticed that when Simpson was trying on a glove for the jury its structure appeared to have changed. 'A bailiff told me the defence had it during the lunch hour.' He said he wasn't specifically accusing anyone, adding: 'It's been my suspicion for a long time that the lining has been manipulated.' He said he had previously voiced similar concerns in TV interviews, but could not recall the details.Darden's incendiary charge surprised key participants in the trial and related legal action. Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz, who was a member of Simpson's defence team, and Paul Callan, who represented Nicole Brown Simpson's estate in a successful civil trial against Simpson, said it was the first time they had ever heard the allegation. On Friday, Dershowitz called the claim that the defence had an opportunity to tamper with the gloves 'a total fabrication' and said 'the defence doesn't get access to evidence except under controlled circumstances.' 'Having made the greatest legal blunder of the 20th Century,' Dershowitz said of Darden, 'he's trying to blame it on the dead man.'

Dershowitz, a fellow panellist, called Darden's decision to have Simpson . try on the glove for the first time before the jury 'the most stupid . thing' a prosecutor could have done. Dershowitz . said that if Darden had evidence that there had been tampering, he . would have had an ethical obligation to report the alleged misconduct. He also questioned why Darden hadn't filed a grievance with the state bar association. Darden responded by saying that this would have been a 'whiny-little-snitch approach to life' and that was not what he believed in because it didn't change anything. The event was part of a 'Trials and Errors' series, co-sponsored by Pace Law School and the Forum on Law, Culture & Society at Fordham Law, that examines America's most controversial cases. Also on the panel were Goldman's father, Fred Goldman, and his sister, Kim Goldman. Derek Sells, the managing partner of Cochran's old law firm, The Cochran Firm, did not respond to requests for comment. A call to Cochran's daughter, Tiffany Cochran Edwards, who is a communications director for the firm, was not immediately returned. Cochran died in 2005 from a brain tumour at age 67.

Simpson was acquitted in the double murder case despite what prosecutors described as a 'mountain of evidence' against him. The evidence included a blood-soaked glove found on Simpson's estate and a matching one found at the scene of the murder. Questions about the lining of the gloves emerged during the 1995 trial, but they did not involve allegations of tampering by defence lawyers. Two other members of Simpson's defence team, Robert Shapiro and Barry Scheck, did not return calls for comment. Robert Kardashian and F. Lee Bailey, who also represented Simpson, are both deceased. A civil jury in 1997 found Simpson liable for the deaths and ordered him to pay $33.5million in damages to the murder victims' families. Simpson is currently serving up to 33 years in prison for a 2007 armed robbery in which he claimed he was trying to recover his own sports memorabilia.

Gabe Park was born with six fingers and toes on both hands and feet but has undergone surgery to correct the condition . A schoolboy who was born with six fingers and toes on both hands has undergone surgery to correct the condition - and is now hoping to join the RAF when he's older. Gabe Park, 7, was born with polydactyly, meaning he had 24 digits in total and without surgery he could have faced major difficulties walking. He inherited the genetic condition from his late father, Kevin, who also had the same number of extra fingers and toes in the same position. Gabe, of Millom, Cumbria, underwent major operations when he was a baby to remove his extra digits - which were located between his thumb and first finger and between his big toe and second toe. He can now walk and use his hands, but the condition left his feet far wider than average, meaning his mother Julie, 40, faces difficulty getting shoes which fit properly. Every few months the youngster, who loves sports, has to be fitted with bespoke prescription shoes and attends appointments at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle to have his feet measured. Mrs Park has been told her son may face more surgery in the future because his big toes are growing out from his feet rather than straight. Gabe underwent his first surgery - to remove the extra finger from his left hand - in February 2006 and again in July 2006 to his right hand. The youngster inherited the condition, known as polydactyly, from his late father Kevin, who also had the same number of extra fingers and toes in the same position . Gabe underwent his first surgery - to remove the extra finger from his left hand - in February 2006 and again in July 2006 to his right hand . He then had both legs operated on in October 2007 and spent a month with his legs bandaged as he recovered. Without the operation his mobility could have been impaired as his extra toes could have affected his balance. His mother said: 'The operations were partly for aesthetic reasons but doctors said the toes could grow over each other like when you cross your fingers and that could cause major problems.' Mrs Park met husband Kevin in Kosovo in 2002 when she worked for the UN as an IT network administrator and he was seconded by the Ministry of Defence police. She said: 'Kevin told me about how he’d had surgery when he was a young boy as he had extra fingers and toes, and when I became pregnant I knew my children could have with the same condition because it was genetic. 'When Gabe was born and we saw he was just like his dad, it made him even more special.' He then had both legs operated on in October 2007 and spent a month with his legs bandaged as he recovered. Without the operation his mobility could have been impaired as his extra toes could have affected his balance . Mr Park went on to work as a security consultant for the Foreign Office but was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2008 and passed away in May 2009. Gabe wants become an RAF pilot when he grows up but could face more operations in the future to correct his feet as his toes grow outwards. Mrs Park, a full-time mother, said: 'The doctor has advised he doesn’t have the next operation because it could affect his muscles and tendons. 'However, the more time has passed, I worry that it could disable him further if his big toes continue to grow outwards and it might stop him of achieving his dream career. I've got to think of his future. ' She also has a three-year-old daughter, Maddie, who does not suffer from the condition. Polydactyly . affects about five babies in every 10,000. It may run in families - if . both parents have it there's a one in two chance that their children . will be affected. But it may also occur out of the blue. Gabe has missed out on activities his friends enjoy,  such as playing outdoors at school, because he does not have waterproof shoes as they are not provided on the NHS. Gabe wants become an RAF pilot when he grows up but could face more operations in the future to correct his feet as his toes grow outwards . His mother said: 'Due to his condition, his feet are much wider than normal and that means I can’t just buy shoes from the high street. 'He only ever has one pair of shoes at a time from the NHS, so we have to be careful they don’t get ruined. 'His school said he needs special waterproof shoes or wellies like all the other pupils to take part in the outdoor activities, but I haven’t been able to get any until now. 'We had to be careful about what we do, so if it was raining we couldn’t go for walks in case his shoes got damaged because it takes a long time to get them replaced.' But the youngster cam finally play with his friends in wet and wintry weather after he had a pair of . special custom waterproof boots made. After a generous donation by a well-wisher, she was able to have his pair of his old existing shoes modified to turn them into waterproof boots for £90. He can now walk and use his hands, but the condition has left his feet far wider than average,meaning his mother Julie struggles to find shoes to fit him . But she has been told the next pair, which have to be made from scratch, will cost up to £1,500. She said: 'Every company I contacted to make the winter boots said they couldn’t do it. Some were saying it was impossible. 'I was eventually given 11 pages of contacts throughout the UK from the Independent Footwear Retail Association. Out of everyone I contacted only one said they would take my case on but it will cost between £1,000 - £1,500 for the next pair. 'The cost is just unbelievable and I also have to pay for travel for us both to go to the manufacturers in Potter’s Bar near London for the fitting. 'I made an appeal in our local paper towards the cost and someone donated £100 anonymously. I cried when I found out, it was so nice of them. 'I’m glad we could get him these waterproof shoes so he can join in at school, but they are so expensive and of course his feet will keep on growing so he will need new ones all the time. 'He can’t be the only person in the country facing this problem so I’m hoping people can come forward to help us find someone who can make them at a more affordable price.'","Gabe Park, 7, was born with polydactyly, meaning he had 24 digits in total .

Now the costume designer of the much-loved Nineties TV series has revealed that the tulle skirt in that now-iconic sequence was a $5 bargain find.

'So when I showed it . to Sarah Jessica, she loved it. And I said, ""Okay, so we’ll put it with a . little T-shirt,"" and she loved it. She . felt it. 'And then we had to convince Darren.

Ms Field, who also created costumes for Ugly Betty and the Devil Wears Prada, went on to explain that it was one of four options considered for the opening credits, one was a tight-fitting, colourful dress, the others she can no longer recall. Many of those involved in making the . decision favoured the dress, but she says she was adamant that the tutu . and T-shirt be used because the dress would date easily, while her . favoured look would not.

Appearing on ITV1's Daybreak, 38-year-old Anna wanted to speak out about her harassment at the hands of her ex  to give a voice to other women - and men - trapped in abusive relationships. She said: 'I was . pleased that he got convicted, but I was appalled at the sentence - . community service for what he did. I want to send . out the message that emotional abuse can be more damaging than physical . abuse, external bruises fade but the bruises inside . me they are still there, it’s really hard.' Anna Larke appeared on Daybreak this morning to discuss her abusive relationship with comedian Justin Lee Collins who was sentenced last week . In her first television interview since Collins was convicted of harassment causing her fear of violence on at least two occasions Anna, from West London, revealed that although she left Collins over his behaviour it was actually her father who went to the police and convinced her to press charges. She said: 'I didn’t actually go to the police. When I left him on July 4, I just went home to my parents and slept in the spare room and for about two and half months I was just crying and looking at websites about domestic abuse because I was always one of these people who just thought, ""I'd never put up with that. The minute someone swore at me I'd be gone"". 'But it was my dad who went to the police. I was reluctant to, but I spoke to them and they were amazing and I just thought there is no way I can let him get away with this because who’s he going to hurt next?'

When asked why she put up with the abuse, she said: 'I absolutely adored him, he was the love of my life. In the beginning he was so lovely, but gently, ever so – I don’t know how they do it, but the abuse is just sort of drip fed, and by the time that you’re in love and completely smitten and I’ve moved in with him and everything, then you think, ""Oh my God, he’s a control freak"" because I’ve got no friends now. 'When we were first together it was absolutely amazing. He was just so wonderful, kind, generous, lovely, love of my life actually, and I just thought to myself, ""How on earth did I ever get so lucky?"".' Collins' controlling behaviour included stopping her speaking to friends and family, dictating what she should wear, taunts about her weight and pushing her in front of a moving car. He even made her write down a list of anyone she had ever been intimate with on a pad of paper. Anna said: 'By doing the pad he had a . complete record of my past, which is the ultimate control and he would use . it against me.'

A bride has told of the devastating moment she was told she had cancer on her dream wedding day. The 'baby' she thought she was pregnant with turned out to be a tumour - and bride to be Lucy Duffy from Leeds was told it was cancerous hours before making her vows. But despite the bombshell news, Lucy and her fiancé Chris vowed to go ahead with their ceremony – keeping the cancer a secret from their guests. Tragic news: Lucy Duffy on her wedding day with husband Chris, just hours after being told that what she thought was a growing baby bump was actually a cancerous tumour . Tinged with sadness: Despite bravely going ahead with the wedding and keeping the cancer a secret from guests, the day was a challenge for Lucy, who admitted she collapsed sobbing when the party had ended . Poignantly they promised to love each other in sickness and in health and now Lucy is responding so well to chemotherapy that the couple hope to try for a baby again soon. Lucy said: 'We had spent two years planning our dream wedding. I never expected anything to go wrong, I certainly never expected to hear the word cancer on the morning of my wedding. 'We kept it from our guests because we wanted our wedding to remain a happy day. We wanted people to have a good time.' The nightmare started when Lucy and Chris started trying for a baby ahead of their wedding. They hoped she would conceive quickly so they could share their joy during the speeches on the big day. Naturally they were delighted when just weeks later a test showed Lucy had fallen pregnant. 'I was over the moon. We couldn't believe how lucky we had been to fall pregnant so quickly.' Shock: On the morning of the wedding the consultant rang to say Lucy had experienced a full molar pregnancy. 'I knew straight away it meant cancer. First I'd lost our wedding baby and then I was being told I had cancer on our wedding day' Brave: 'We had spent two years planning our dream wedding. We kept the cancer news from our guests because we wanted our wedding to remain a happy day. We wanted people to have a good time,' says Lucy . The pregnancy appeared to be . progressing well, but a few weeks before the wedding Lucy experienced . severe morning sickness and tiredness. When she noticed light bleeding she called the pregnancy unit who assured her all the symptoms were normal. A molar pregnancy like the one experienced by Lucy happens when a non-viable egg implants itself into the womb and begins to grow. It happens when a sperm, or more than one sperm, meets an egg during fertlisation, but the sperm and egg cannot support a normal pregnancy. The cells mutate instead of multiplying  normally and the placenta forms into cysts. Occasionally the mutated tissues grows into the muscle layer of the uterus - an invasive mole. In rare cases like Lucy's this can become cancerous and require medical treatment. 'I started to relax and think of names. I imagined how wonderful our wedding day would be sharing our special news. But after a heavier bleed at six weeks she went to hospital for a scan to check their baby was OK. She says: ' I knew something was wrong when the sonographer said he needed a second opinion. Finally a consultant looked at the screen and said ' I'm sorry but there is no baby.' 'I thought he meant I'd had a miscarriage. But then he explained there were dark shadows in my womb that showed I'd had a molar pregnancy.' Lucy had never heard of a molar pregnancy before. The consultant explained that at the moment of fertilisation something had gone wrong and two sperm had entered the egg instead of one, resulting in a mass of cells growing in the womb instead of a baby. The cells had stuck to the lining of the womb and were at risk of multiplying. Lucy would need an operation to remove them. The condition had raised her hormones, which explained why she had suffered severe sickness and tiredness, like most pregnant women. Devoted: Lucy and Chris in Las Vegas where they got engaged . 'I was devastated. I couldn't believe that there had never been a baby. We'd been thinking of names for a child which had never existed.' The wedding was just two weeks away. Back home bewildered Lucy researched her condition on line and was shocked to read that in rare cases the cells can turn cancerous and spread around the body in what is known as a full molar pregnancy. The following week she underwent surgery to remove the tumour, which was to be analysed. 'The wedding was a week away and mum and Chris suggested postponing but I didn't want all our planning to go to waste.' On the morning of the wedding on 16 September last year Lucy had just finished decorating the tables when the consultant rang and confirmed she had experienced a full molar pregnancy. Lucy and Chris were given the all clear to go on their honeymoon - and Lucy started chemo on their return. Now a year later tests show the cancer is under control . 'I knew straight away it meant cancer. First I'd lost our wedding baby and then I was being told I had cancer on our wedding day. I was shaking.' 'The room looked stunning and the ceremony was just hours away. I vowed not to break down and to get on with the day and Chris said he would support me whatever I decided.' Hours later nobody would have known the importance behind the vows when they pledged to love each other in sickness and in health.' Lucy says: ' It was very emotional, obviously the vows meant so much.' But she says there were thankfully fleeting moments of joy where she was able to forget about the cancer. When the party had finished she collapsed sobbing in her grooms arms. 'It was partly because we'd had such a wonderful day, but party I was terrified about having cancer.' She was given the all clear for their honeymoon in Mexico and back home started blood tests to measure the hormone changes that would indicate if the cancer had spread. Unfortunately they showed Lucy did need to start chemotherapy. Now a year after diagnosis, blood tests show Lucy's hormones have dipped to their lowest yet and doctors are hopeful they will continue to fall giving her the all clear soon. It will be another six months before she can try for a baby again. 'I've learned early on that not everything in married life goes to plan. Being told I had cancer on our wedding day was the hardest possible start, but now I know we can come through anything.'","Kept the news secret on her big day to avoid ruining the event for her friends and family .

An Oregon family who became desperately ill after unknowingly buying a former meth lab is delivering a petition to Freddie Mac demanding it check all its properties for the drug's residue. Beth and Jonathan Hankins bought the foreclosed home in Klamath Falls from the government-sponsored housing organisation this summer for just $36,500 - but had no idea about its history. Within days of moving into the property with their infant son, Ezra, they began experiencing breathing problems and, after weeks, they were struck with agonizing mouth sores, nose bleeds and migraines. Demands: Beth and Jonathan Hankins are delivering a petition to Freddie Mac demanding it check all its homes for meth residue after they unknowingly moved into a former meth lab, pictured . 'We mostly experienced extreme dry mouth and had mouth sores, making it extremely painful to even drink water,' Mr Hankins told ABC News. They were about to call the doctor when a neighbour revealed . the truth about the home's previous tenants and just as . quickly as they had taken ill, their dream purchase became their . nightmare. They bought a $50 testing kit and found that the house on 2427 Radcliffe was . not only a meth lab but that its contamination level was nearly 80 . times higher than the Oregon Health Authority limit. The couple promptly moved in with relatives before renting another property nearby, and now lament that they are facing financial ruin. More than they bargained for: The Klamath Falls, Oregon house on Radcliffe was visibly in need of repair but methamphetamine toxins are invisible and they had no idea of the property's history . Mr and Mrs Hankins, the owner of a coffee house and an ER . nurse,  had bought the home from Freddie Mac for what . they considered a steal, even though they knew it needed work. 'We said, ""It needs a little bit of love, but it's got good bones,""' Jonathan Hankins told Yahoo News. 'We just had no idea that those bones were poisonous - the walls were poisoning us.' After learning of its former use as a meth labl, they contacted Freddie Mac to find out why they had not been told. They learned the local authorities had not contacted the Oregon Health Authority, as is customary, as there had not been any recent drug-related enforcement actions at the home, ABC reported. Freddie Mac said it encourages buyers to check federal agency listings kept about meth labs, but the Hankins said the organisation only encouraged them to test how structurally secure the home was. Superficial: Before disaster struck, Jonathan Hankins and his two-year-old son Ezra painted the walls of their new home thinking they only had to make minor repairs and give the house a little love to resurrect it . Good as new? The Hankins spent about $5,000 on upgrading rooms like the bathroom before discovering the shocking news about their beloved home . Decline: Beth Hankins, an ER nurse, started experiencing breathing problems before her husband started suffering from migraines and nosebleeds and Ezra developed mouth sores . The couple is delivering a petition to Freddie Mac's New York offices to ask the organisation to require testing of homes for meth residue before they are sold. The Hankins said they are also considering taking legal action against Freddie Mac. Though in 23 states, including Oregon, . laws require sellers to disclose if a property was ever used as a . clandestine drug laboratory, Freddie Mac claims it had no idea of the . Klamath Falls house's history. And because they sold it 'as is' to . the Hankins family, it is no longer their responsibility to clean up or . contribute to the costs associated with the disastrous discovery. Freddie . Mac spokesman Brad German told ABC: 'We certainly empathize with the . situation, but we had no prior information about the way the home had . been used. If we had, of course, we would have disclosed it.' Unaware: Within days of moving in, Beth started developing breathing problems and just weeks later, the couple's son Ezra, started getting mouth sores and was unable to drink water . Kicked out: A neighbour told them the home had been a meth lab and the couple moved out . Joe . Mazzuca of Meth Lab Cleanup admitted that even with disclosure laws, . only one in ten labs are busted and since the toxins are invisible 'you . don't always see the meth residue.' 'It's extremely dangerous stuff,' he said of methamphetamine. He also explained that information . regarding the history of a property routinely falls through the cracks . by the time the bank or government agency has reached the point of . foreclosure. According . to Mr Mazzuca he receives calls from people in exactly the same . position as the Hankins every three to five minutes and recently heard . from a man in Michigan who unknowingly bought a contaminated home that . killed his 14-year-old daughter after two years. Mr . Hankins meanwhile is less willing to let Freddie Mac off the hook for . their part in the sale and vented his frustration on a petition on Change.org, which now has more than 200,000 signatures.

A 17-year-old girl died after suffering massive internal bleeding from a routine appendix operation. Victoria Katie Harrison, from Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, was admitted to Kettering General Hospital for the procedure on August 15 this year. Young, fit and healthy, the trainee hairdresser's operation was supposed to be straightforward. Instead, she began to bleed heavily. Despite desperate attempts to save her, Victoria died the next day. An investigation into her death is now underway. Victoria Harrison died after after routine surgery to remove her appendix. It's claimed by her family that she developed a tear in her artery after surgeons made an incision to insert their tools . Over 300 people attended the funeral for Victoria, known as 'Tor'. She was buried in a pink coffin, wearing her favourite 'onesie’ outfit and holding a Snickers bar, her favourite snack . Victoria's family claim her death was possibly caused by surgeons accidentally tearing a hole in an artery while inserting a micro-camera into her stomach. The appendix is usually removed via keyhole surgery as it means a shorter stay in hospital and a quicker recovery. It takes around 30minutes to perform under a general anaesthetic. The surgeon makes two or three small cuts of about 1cm each in the lower abdomen and passes special instruments through to remove the organ. A tiny camera is also inserted - this beams up images on to a nearby screen so the surgeon can see what's happening inside the body. Once the appendix has been removed, the cuts are then closed with stitches or glue. Victoria's devastated mother Tracy Foskett has taken to a Facebook group set up in her daughter's memory to explain to baffled friends why she died. She wrote: 'Just to let everyone know, Victoria died of internal bleeding from a tear to the hole where they inserted the camera. But she did not suffer.' She later added: 'She was such a lovely girl - everyone called her their best friend. She was also my best friend - I even go to call her sometimes now. She was loved by so many people and she was so popular. 'We are such a close family and did so much together. I don’t ever want her to be forgotten.' Over 300 people attended the funeral for Victoria, known as 'Tor', when she was laid to rest last month. She was buried in a pink coffin, wearing her beloved ‘onesie’ outfit and holding a Snickers bar - her favourite snack.

Although they are looking forward to the 100metres . Businesses in the shadow of the Olympic Stadium are enraged at what they call the betrayal of Sebastian Coe's promises that London 2012 would boost the local community. One of the boasts of Lord Coe's team was how local businesses would be helped by having the Games on their doorsteps, yet dozens only a few hundred metres from the Olympic Stadium now claim they are being deliberately denied the opportunity to cash-in. In what locals described as an 'extraordinary and shameful' decision just days before the Opening Ceremony, Hackney Wick, one of the railway stations closest to the Olympic Park where tens of thousands of visitors are expected each day is to be closed, depriving businesses of potential customers. Shops, restaurants and bars in the East London area known for its artistic community have been gearing up for thousands of new customers investing money in advertising and PR for the Games, as well as recruiting extra staff in anticipation of brisk trade. Local businessman James Morgan, owner of the bar and cafe The Hackney Pearl, said: 'This decision is outrageous and flies in the face of what we were promised. 'We were led to believe there would be an increase in trade and yet we are now effectively being cut off from any access at all. 'It makes a mockery of the Olympic bid as it was based on these promises.' Many organisations moved to the area to specifically benefit from the Olympics and they are astonished that only now have been told the key access to them is effectively being shut-off. Hackney Wick station is one stop from Stratford, the main gateway to the Olympics, and Transport for London and Lorol, the owners of London Overground, say westbound trains will not pick-up passengers from the station from 1pm each day. They contend the trains are likely to be packed full from Stratford and would not be able to take on extra passengers at Hackney Wick where the platform for those travelling back to Central London would be full. With road closures and bus diversions affecting access to the area and parts of the river towpath, previously touted as an Olympic route, shut down, one supermarket owner said: 'It is an absolute betrayal – we have built-up stocks for these weeks and now it will end-up costing us. 'It seems a disgrace that only now are we being told of this decision, why wasn't it made months ago so we could plan properly?' The Yard Theatre, a performance space approved by The Legacy List, the very creation of which was to rejuvenate the areas closest to the Olympics, is among those hit. Hackney Wick, one of the railway stations closest to the Olympic Park, is to be closed to westbound trains, depriving businesses of potential customers . Producer Dominic Lindesay-Bethune expects at 'a conservative estimate the loss of income of more than £20,000 over the two weeks, with many of our 12 staff being forced to take indeterminate unpaid leave.' Department store chain John Lewis today said Olympics fever helped drive a 17.3 per cent hike in sales as shoppers rushed to snap up London 2012 themed goods. The group notched up £70.3million in sales last week thanks to strong demand for Olympics related sports clothing and homeware, while it also received a boost from the final week of clearance. John Lewis added that customers were hitting stores to pick up bargains as a form of ""retail therapy"" amid the ongoing poor summer weather. Sales of London 2012 products meant a 39 per cent year-on-year surge in sportswear and spur an 8.9 per cent lift in home revenues in the week to July 14. Fellow local business man Stuart Hatton, joint MD of a local film production company, has sympathy for businesses that rely on footfall: . 'We were looking forward to there being a real buzz in the local community. Some businesses actually moved here to capitalise on the Olympic Games though it now seems that the opposite will happen. I can't see the logic in it and the reason for the decision has not been explained to us.' LOCOG, the London organising authority, have created much fanfare over the amount of work and income that the Games will generate however it seems that for the independent businesses of Hackney Wick the opposite will be true, should this closure go ahead. Resident and owner of Dee Dee's Vintage, Dee O'Connell relies on the train service to meet clients, as well as having staff whose commute will be disrupted. But she also draws attention to the impact it will have on residents. Many of her neighbours are elderly and . they rely on the bus and train services to reach nearby amenities. 'These people will be trapped,' she said. 'I really don't know what they are . going to do. Many of these people are without the internet and cannot . walk more than short distances. Their quality of life will be totally . affected.' Businesses have raised a petition and hope that transport chiefs will relent. Many organisations moved to Hackney Wick to benefit from the Olympics and have been left feeling betrayed that access to them is effectively being shut off . Howard Smith, Chief Operating Officer of TfL London Rail, said: 'During the Games, London will become a massive sporting and cultural venue, with up to one million extra visitors expected in the capital every day at Games-time. 'They will make an additional three million daily journeys, over and above the regular 12m journeys on public transport. 'We and our operators have detailed crowd management plans in place for every station on the network, including Hackney Wick, which will enable us to deal safely with the exceptional increase in passenger numbers on London Overground. 'Those plans are based on the projected increase we expect around key stations serving the Games venues and major Live Sites.' Shops are boarded up, the buildings look tatty and roads are littered with discarded mattresses, cupboards and wardrobes. Welcome to the side of Stratford, east London, that Olympic organisers would rather you didn't see. London . was awarded the 2012 Games after the team behind the bid convinced . officials that it would leave a lasting legacy for the regeneration of . one of the capital's poorest areas. But . these grim pictures, taken only a stone's throw from the Olympic Park, . reveal that more work is needed to turn around Stratford's fortunes.

Tatty: A newsagent's shop in Stratford has its window boarded up . Damaging: This street has a view of the Olympic stadium, but a crashed car has been abandoned on the pavement . Almost £9.3billion has been . spent on the Games - with three-quarters of it earmarked for . regeneration projects - but some residents say it is hard to see where . the money has gone. The area has a new £1.45billion shopping mall, Westfield, which has created 10,000 jobs and brought new waves of shoppers. The . athletes' village is believed to have cost about £1.1billion to build, . although it was sold to Qatari developers last year for only . £557million. But critics fear other parts of Stratford have been forgotten. Julian . Cheyne, of the Counter Olympics Network, a pressure group set up to . hold London 2012 officials to account, said: 'You look at the old .

Cheyne said: 'You could argue that there is no need to spruce it up . because I doubt many visitors to the Olympics will ever bother to . venture outside the Park. 'They will just get the tube or train straight to Stratford and turn left into the Olympic complex. 'It's questionable what tarting up . the area would actually do for the fortunes of the businesses.

'Money needs to be invested in the Stratford Centre, not just the . Olympic Park. A bed shop is closed with shutters drawn down in Stratford town centre . 'It doesn't impact locals if not. How are we meant to compete? 'The least the council could do is lower our rates so we can be more competitive because business has been affected badly.' Residents said the changes they had seen so far were cosmetic. Joe . Alexander said: 'I'm glad Westfield is there, it's a great local . facility for the people of Stratford but you can't help feel it was . created more for people from outside to come in, shop and leave without . really entering the real Stratford. 'It has been given its own district - E20 - and that helps create this idea that it is a separate from the town. 'I . don't think the regeneration and tidying up that's happened before the .

Retired captain David Gwynne James was meant to attend a Remembrance service at Westminster Abbey when he collapsed and had his possessions stolen . An elderly army veteran lay dying in the street while a heartless thief emptied his wallet and drained his bank account drained, an inquest heard today. David Gwynne-James' bank cards were used at a cash machine as little as two minutes after the 74-year-old collapsed with a heart attack. The retired captain and military history author had been preparing to attend a Remembrance Day service at Westminster Abbey, having organised memorials for his former regiment, the King's Shropshire Light Infantry. He was pronounced dead two days later on November 11 last year, having suffered a massive skull fracture and brain damage in the fall, Westminster Coroner's Court was told. His widow, Charmian, only found out about the fraudulent transactions when checking his bank statement two months later, by which time police had no leads because vital CCTV footage had been deleted. Mr Gwynne-James had travelled to London from his home in White Notley, near Witham in Essex, on November 9. At around 11pm, after spending the evening drinking with old friends at the Cavalry and Guards Club in Piccadilly he set off alone to find his hotel. 'He was observed by a witness walking along into King's Street, where he then suddenly clutched his chest and fell backwards, hitting his head as he fell,' said coroner's officer Lynda Morris. Within minutes, paramedics had arrived at the scene near Christie's, the famous auction house, and began desperately trying to restart his heart. The first attempt to withdraw money from his account took place at 11.03pm at a cash machine in adjoining St James's Street - just yards from where he lay. Detective Constable Lynda Rothera told the inquest 'several other attempts' were made to take out more cash that night but failed when the account's daily limit was reached. Service: The war veteran was planing to attend a Remembrance service at Westminster Abbey . 'It was used a few times the day after . in the east of London, in a few shops, before the bank raised a . suspicious alert,' she said. Some . £1,400 was withdrawn in cash, with transactions recorded in . Walthamstow, east London, and Romford, Essex, before the account was . blocked. His grieving family later found out that his watch and glasses had also been stolen. Charmian Gwynne-James, David's widow, arrives at the inquest . Detective Constable Rothera said Mr . Gwynne-James may have been watched as he entered his PIN code at a cash . machine earlier that evening. She said: 'This is one possibility of how the suspects got his PIN numbers. 'We don't know whether that did happen. 'It is only speculation as to how this card was taken from Mr Gwynne-James.' Mr Gwynne-James failed to regain . consciousness after being taken to nearby St Mary's Hospital, where a CT . scan revealed he had suffered a 'significant traumatic brain injury'. A pathologist, who found his right coronary artery to be entirely clogged up, found no evidence of assault and gave the causes of his death as heart attack and a head injury. Mr Gwynne-James, who was born in Pembrokeshire, west Wales, served in the forces for 15 years after joining in 1955, captaining the army cricket team for two seasons. His service included stints in Germany, Kenya, Cyprus, and Oman, upon which he based his book Letters From Oman. In civilian life, he worked for accounting giant Ernst & Young, rising to become its personnel director, before starting his own management consultancy in 1991. Recording a verdict of natural causes, Coroner Fiona Wilcox said the veteran's card was used 'almost at exactly the same time as he collapsed.' She said: 'It is only speculation as to how this card was taken from Mr Gwynne-James. 'I do not think that this court can ever really know. 'There is no connection between this and his subsequent death. 'I am satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that Mr Gwynne-James died as a result of natural causes.' Turning to the family, she added: 'Sorry we have not been able to explain why his belongings disappeared, or how they disappeared.'","David Gwynne-James collapsed from a heart attack .

She’s already the most hated mother in America, and now she’s been misidentified as the person responsible for running down two women outside an Ohio library. Casey Anthony was pictured as the suspect who mowed down two women outside the Bellaire Public Library in western Ohio by a local NBC station. RadarOnline.com reported that WTOV9 originally posted a picture of Casey in court wearing a grey suit, accusing her of hitting the two women on Friday afternoon. By Saturday, the picture had been switched out for the station's logo. One year on: Casey was sensationally acquitted . by a jury last July 5, left, and walked free from jail just over a week . later, right. She was mistakenly identified by an Ohio news station of hitting two women in her car . Mistaken identity: An NBC affiliate in Ohio reported that Casey Anthony was identified as the driver who ran down two women outside the Bellaire Public Library in Ohio . WTOV-9 said that local police were not releasing names of any of the women involved, nor their conditions. Locals flocked to the comment . sections with their own speculations. One wrote: ‘She has been spotted . in Ohio and most recently in Bellaire. Mail is being delivered to a . Casey Anthony on Monroe Street. Wonder if she ran them over, or if . someone tried to rid the world of a baby killer.’ RadarOnline.com notes that the station replaced the picture of Casey with their station logo early Saturday morning. Casey was sensationally acquitted of murdering her daughter Caylee after a highly-publicised trial last July. Anthony is now living in an . undisclosed location in Florida serving probation for an unrelated . conviction, which Baez said ends on August 21. In his book, Presumed Guilty, Casey Anthony: The Inside Story, her attorney Jose Baez also divulges aspects of the Anthony family’s private lives that were not examined during the trial. The lawyer accuses George Anthony of abusing his daughter, and speculates that George could have murdered 2-year-old Caylee to hide evidence of abuse. Accused: Casey Anthony's lawyer accused her father George, left, of sexually assaulting her, and speculates that he killed Casey's daughter Caylee to cover up the abuse . Troubled past: Casey Anthony, centre, pictured July 7th, 2011, says she was frequently molested by her father and told her lawyer that she feared he was Caylee's father . The lawyer accused George of killing the toddler to hide evidence of abuse. Baez first made the shocking allegation at the trial’s opening statements, saying that George killed Caylee, disposed of the girl’s remains, and then lied about it to authorities. Casey confided in Baez that she was worried her father might have fathered Caylee, because he had sex with her around the time she had become pregnant. DNA tests later revealed that George was not the father. George, through a family attorney, denied ever abusing Casey. However, Casey and her father have reportedly been estranged since October 14, 2008, the day, CF 13 News notes, that he testified against her, leading to the grand jury indicting her for murder.He testified in the trial: ‘I would have done anything I could to save my granddaughter.’ Casey Anthony's defense attorney: Jose Baez gestures as he speaks about his just-published book Presumed Guilty, Casey Anthony: The Inside Story almost a year to the day she was acquitted . Someone in the Anthony house . conducted several suicide-related searches on the family computer, . including ‘fool-proof suffocation’ and ‘venturing into the pro-suicide . pit’ on the day little Caylee Anthony vanished, Casey Anthony’s defence . attorney Jose Baez said. The . attorney revealed that the searches were conducted around an hour after . Casey’s father George Anthony said she left the home. While . last year’s trial famously revealed that the family computer also had . searches for ‘chloroform,’ the suicide searches were not revealed, Baez . said, because they were discovered after the fact. He told Good Morning America: ‘I have . a hard time believing that law enforcement wouldn’t check the internet . history of the day that the child went missing. That would have been . bombshell evidence in the trial if it had come out.’ Jose Baez, Casey Anthony's defense lawyer, has written a tell-all book about the case . Prosecutors claimed Anthony . suffocated Caylee with duct tape so she could spend time with her . boyfriend and be free for Orlando's nightlife. Baez said during the trial - repeated . again in his book - that Caylee accidentally drowned in a family . swimming pool and that her father, George Anthony, hid the body. Baez . also claimed George Anthony sexually abused his daughter. George Anthony denied both . allegations, and there was little brought up about them during the . trial. Baez said the defence wasn't required to put on any such evidence . because proving the case is the prosecution's burden, not the other way . around. George Anthony tried to commit . suicide in January 2009, and was found in a Daytona Beach hotel after . overdosing on prescription drugs. A five-page suicide note was also . discovered at the hotel. Baez told GMA that it was hard to . determine who in the Anthony family conducted what searches on January . 16, 2008, but said it was possible to infer who searched what, based on . the terms searched. For instance, one of the terms . searched was ‘foolproof suffocation.’ Baez noted that the terms were . spelled incorrectly, and that George struggled with good spelling. He wrote in his book: ‘By looking at . the websites being researched, all concerned with suicide and death, it . certainly appears that the one who felt the blame was a guilt-ridden . George Anthony.’ In his book, Baez also lashes out at . several entities - calling the media a 'monster', the police 'careless' and the prosecution 'scheming and ruthless'. He wrote: 'This was not real life, it was the media's Casey Anthony . reality show, a show that depended on name-calling and controversy for . television ratings.' Evidence and testimony showed that Casey was a habitual liar, even making up fake friends and pretending . every day to go to a job she didn't have at Universal Studios. Baez was asked whether . Anthony's lies surrounding her daughter's disappearance might be . indicative that she was guilty. Counsel: Defence attorney Jose Baez talks to . Casey Anthony during her trial when the jury heard her father say . her car smelled of human decomposition. Baez revealed in his book he also thought he could smell a dead body . Innocent: Mystery surrounds the cause of Caylee Anthony's death after her mother was acquitted of her murder one year ago today . 'I don't think the lies are . indicative of innocence or guilt,' he said. 'The lies were there long . before Caylee passed away.' In the book, he says Anthony had built a . 'fantasy world,' and her lies weren't evidence of guilt but signs of . someone with 'serious mental health issues.' Baez said one piece of prosecution . evidence he was most concerned about was that police cadaver dogs had . indicated a body may have been in the trunk of Anthony's car at one . point and also that a body may have been in the backyard. None was . discovered in the backyard and there was nothing but rotting bags of . trash in the trunk. But, he said, people - and jurors - believe in dogs. 'That concerned me a little bit. Most people really think dogs can do magic,' Baez said. He also strongly considered early in the case whether she should plead guilty to . a lesser charge to avoid the death penalty if convicted of murdering . her two-year-old daughter Caylee, but Anthony adamantly insisted she had . nothing to do with the toddler's death.

Winnie Johnson, the mother of moors murder victim Keith Bennett never stopped her fight to find her son's body and vowed to keep on searching 'until the end of her days.' But this morning, after a 48-year campaign, she tragically died in a Manchester hospice after battling cancer. The last time Winnie Johnson saw her 12-year-old son Keith was when he waved goodbye as he walked to his grandmother’s house in Longsight, Manchester, on June 16, 1964. But he was snatched off the street by Ian Brady and Myra Hindley – the third of their five known victims. For 20 years, Mrs Johnson never knew . what happened to her son until Brady and Hindley confessed to murdering . him on Saddleworth Moor, Greater Manchester. He is the only one of their five victims whose body has never been recovered. Mrs Johnson, who was 78, made several thousand trips to the Moors in search of her son and has written to every prime minister since he disappeared, begging for help. Even recently, with her health failing, she refused to give up, employing private firms with sniffer dogs to try to locate Keith’s remains. At the time she said: ‘I’ll never stop searching until he’s found. I’ll go on and on until I bring him home. When he’s found, I’ll know I’ve done my duty as a mother. I’ll be at ease then.’ Scroll down for video . Desperate search: Winnie Johnson,  digging with her 23 year old son Joey, on Saddleworth Moor near Manchester vowed to keep on searching 'until the end of her days' Mrs Johnson, who was gravely ill in a hospice with terminal cancer, had written ‘hundreds’ of letters to Brady begging him to reveal where Keith’s body is buried before she died, including a heartfelt plea in December revealing the extent of her illness. But, as had happened countless times before, Brady was unmoved by her dying plea and failed to reply. ‘He’s just playing games. I can’t get over it,’ she said. Her . death comes just days after revelations that a bombshell letter written . by Ian Brady supposedly reveals where he and Myra Hindley buried her . 12-year-old son in 1964. Mercifully, perhaps, Mrs Johnson was too ill to be told of the latest claims of Brady’s letter. Hope: Winnie Johnson, lighting a memorial candle at Manchester Cathedral during her son's memorial service in 2010 .

Her hopes of finally laying Keith to . rest were stoked in 2003 after detectives from Greater Manchester Police . launched a special investigation, Operation Maida, in a bid to find the . remains. Brady coldly refused to help with . this endeavour, dismissing officers with a wave of his hand from his bed . when they visited him at Ashworth. At . a memorial service for Keith, held at Manchester Cathedral in February . 2010, Mrs Johnson finally got the chance to remember her eldest son with . a poignant memorial service.

Today she said she believed Mrs Johnson, 78, always thought she would be given some peace by discovering where her 12-year-old son Keith Bennett was buried. And she said if there is an afterlife, Mrs Johnson will be reunited with Keith. 'It's terrible news, how awful,' she said. 'I had met her through Families Fighting for Justice. 'Being in a similar situation as Winnie, not to find your child's body causes a tangible pain. 'For a child to be murdered is one of the worst things that can happen to a mother and then not to be able to say goodbye, that is all she lived for and she pleaded with Brady.' Mrs Taylor criticised Brady for tormenting her by refusing to disclose the schoolboy's burial spot. 'Killers like these have to have control,' she said. 'They get off on knowing because they get self-gratification as Brady did. 'I'm Keith's mother,' Mrs Johnson, who . was helped to the cathedral lectern by a young family friend, sobbed. 'I've lived through this life knowing he is on those Moors. I just want . him back. 'I'll do anything, go anywhere for him. As long as I know one day, I'll be grateful. 'I hope he's found before I am dead. All I want out of life is to find him and bury him. I just wish he is found before I go.' During the hour-long service, Mrs Johnson spoke in front of a large painting of her son based on the famous black and white photo of the smiling youngster. Keith, the congregation heard, was a cheerful child, and, in a time when children's experiences were confined to the neighbourhood where they were born, he enjoyed street games, marbles and cycling. He was a young boy with a 'happy-go-lucky attitude and a cheeky grin', who kept leaves in a scrapbook, collected coins and loved football. Mrs Johnson then appealed directly to Brady to reveal the whereabouts of Keith's remains, via a DVD. On the DVD, recorded in April 2011, she said she was receiving treatment for cancer of the womb, adding: 'I've got cancer and if you've got any decency or respect for yourself and for me, you would tell me where Keith is because that is the last thing I want to happen before I die.' 'I'm doing it in the hope he will respond – that’s if he watches it,' Mrs Johnson, from Longsight, Manchester, told The People. 'The most important thing is to find Keith before the cancer beats me. 'He knows where Keith is but I think he enjoys having that last bit of power – and if I find Keith he’ll have nothing left. Her marathon quest for justice has been an emotional roller coaster requiring unprecedented courage and determination.

Winnie Thompson often revisited the Saddleworth Moor, Greater Manchester, with flowers . Last year she refused to back the . return of the death penalty insisting 'hanging is too quick' and child . murderers must be made to suffer. She said: 'Hanging is too quick. Child killers like Brady must be made to suffer, in the way he hurt my . Keith and all the other little ones. 'The rope is too simple a solution . for his sort. Serial killers like him need to be left to rot, for years, . when hopefully they will reflect on their appalling crimes.

'The gesture would mean so much, especially as all police searches for Keith's body have officially ended. 'If Brady had swung for his crimes . against my son and the others, there would have been no chance - however . slim it is - of him relenting and putting me out of my misery by . pinpointing Keith's grave.' In 1995, Mrs Thompson was outraged when the Royal Academy of Art displayed a portrait of Myra Hindley, made of children's fingerprints was put on display. She put together a protest group for the duration of the show and urged visitors to boycott it. When the organisers refused to remove it, protests became even stronger and two visitors managed to throw eggs at Marcus' Harvey’s canvas, forcing it to undergo a quick restoration.

Accused: Alwen Jones, 24, denies murder and manslaughter but says the victim 'deserved it' A woman who stabbed a young mother to death claimed her victim ‘got what she deserved’. Alwen Jones fatally attacked 31-year-old Emma Jones with a kitchen knife at a party in Penygroes near Caernarfon, North Wales last December. The 24-year-old defendant later told police ‘what goes around comes around’, a jury heard today. Alwen Jones denies murder and manslaughter of mother-of-one Emma, claiming in an earlier interview her actions were justified as ‘she stabbed a family member of mine a few weeks ago’. The incident took place at a party in a block of flats near Emma Jones‘ home attended by the defendant’s sister Grace and the victim. According to witnesses Alwen Jones turned up outside the building screaming: ‘Come outside if you think you are hard enough Emma bach [little Emma]‘ . Once Emma Jones responded and came to the front door, the defendant stabbed her in the chest. Ian Murphy QC, prosecuting, said the victim did nothing to provoke the ‘violent outburst’ and was unable to defend herself. Prosecution described how Alwen Jones had armed herself with a kitchen knife after a phone call from her 21-year-old sister Grace which involved Emma Jones. Grace had called her boyfriend, who was at Alwen Jones’ home, in the early hours of December 10 and told him that Emma Jones and her partner had asked her to leave after a disagreement with another woman. When the boyfriend informed Alwen . Jones, of nearby Llanllyfni, about the exchange, she placed a kitchen . knife down her top and made the ten minute walk to the party. Later she told police that her ‘blood was boiling’ and that she was ‘mad’. After taunting Emma to come outside, Alwen Jones said she ‘flipped and went for her with . the knife’, with Emma bleeding from a stab wound to the chest. The defendant then threw the knife in a nearby front garden before . making her way to her father’s home where she hid in a shed.

Murphy said: ‘This is a case where the defendant armed herself with a . knife and walked purposefully for ten minutes to the scene to find her . sister safe from potential harm outside the building where Emma Jones . was. ‘Thereafter, in what . can only be anger and aggression, Alwen Jones conducted a verbal . exchange with Emma Jones who as a result came downstairs to the front . door.' Family: Emma Jones family arriving at Caernarfon Crown Court today; her mother Cath, father Barry and younger sister Clare Jones . The trial continues at Caernarfon Crown Court this week . Mr Murphy added: 'In further anger and aggression, without warning, the defendant stabbed Emma Jones through the chest. 'The defendant didn't have a reasonable belief she needed to defend herself or her sister and she was throughout the aggressor. 'What we have in this case is a loss of temper and anger. This is clearly a tragic case with tragic consequences.’ Part-time worker Emma Jones had lived in the local area all her life and was a devoted mother to her 11-year-old autistic son.

Which only makes it even more remarkable that Jamie Oliver has just been named as Britain’s second biggest-selling author since records began – with total book sales of £126 million. The Essex-born television chef and school meals campaigner, who has sold more than 10 million cook books, is ranked second only to Harry Potter author J K Rowling. Cooking up a fortune: Jamie Oliver, pictured with his wife Jools, has come second in the list of the top 50 most valuable authors compiled by The Bookseller . Ms Rowling’s seven books about the boy wizard have generated sales of more than  £237.6 million.The newly released sales figures have been compiled by The Bookseller – the publishing industry’s trade magazine. It has drawn up lists of Britain’s 50 most successful authors and the country’s 50 biggest-selling titles. Father-of-four Oliver, 37, who is famous . for his ‘Pukka’ catchphrase and whose bestsellers include The Naked . Chef and Jamie’s 30 Minute Meals, is joined on the bestseller list by . some of his culinary rivals. Delia Smith is in tenth place, Nigella Lawson is ranked 19th and Gordon Ramsay is towards the bottom of the chart at 45. Together, the four chefs account for 40 per cent of all the cook books sold  in Britain since records began in 1998. The success of the chefs is due in no small part to the fact that all four have fronted high-profile  TV shows – and other television personalities and celebrities also feature strongly in the list. Most valuable: Harry Potter author JK Rowling topped the list put together by The Bookseller . They include Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson, who is ranked at 24, television gardener and chatshow host Alan Titchmarsh at 42, and former Page 3 girl Katie Price, who is 46th. Perhaps most surprising is the presence of Richard Parsons, the author of bestselling GCSE study guides, at No 8. Publishers have long known that sex sells and the charts also reflect the runaway success of the Fifty Shades Of Grey series of erotic novels which have sold more than 8.9 million copies in less than a year. E L James, the British author of the books who was unknown this time last year, is now Britain’s 26th most successful writer,  ahead of more established  favourites such as Wilbur Smith and Josephine Cox. Fifty Shades Of Grey, the first instalment of her trilogy, has sold more than 3.9 million copies and is currently seventh on the list of bestsellers. That puts it narrowly ahead of its sequels Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed, which are ranked 13th and 14th. But American writer Dan Brown’s 2003 novel The Da Vinci Code is still the country’s biggest-selling book, having sold more than 5.2 million copies. Brown himself is the sixth most successful author. Stieg Larsson, the Swedish author of the Millennium series of novels, which were published posthumously, is ranked at No 36 with sales worth more than £32 million. Several of Britain’s most celebrated novelists including Ian McEwan, the author of Atonement, and Birdsong writer Sebastian Faulks also feature. Faulks, who is ranked 35, has sold 4.6 million books since 1998 and is only narrowly ahead of McEwan on 4.5 million. Children’s literature, remains a potent sales force. As well as Rowling, the prolific Enid Blyton – author of Noddy, the Famous Five and many other story series – is at No 37. Meanwhile Tracey Beaker creator Jacqueline Wilson, War Horse author Michael Morpurgo and Roger Hargreaves the creator of the Mr Men stories are also in  the Top 50. Noticeable by their absence are classic works such as Charlotte Bronte’s Jane Eyre and Pride And Prejudice by Jane Austen. The Bookseller believes this is partly because they achieved the bulk of their sales before 1998.","Television chef Jamie Oliver has sold more than 10 million cook books .

A man accused of killing his ex-girlfriend and then driving hundreds of miles to dump her body recorded an interview about the case with the 'Dr. Phil' show just two days before confessing to detectives, it has emerged. Mark Augustin Castellano, a 37-year-old computer technician, has been charged with the murder of 31-year-old Michelle Warner after he confessed to police. Her body was found in a West Texas oil field  on Sunday evening after she had been missing from her Houston home for a week. Death: Mark Augustin Castellano, left,  has been charged with the murder of 31-year-old Michelle Warner, right, after confessing to police. It has now emerged he taped an interview for the 'Dr. Phil' show before confessing . Controversial: Dr. Phil, pictured, also conducted an interview with Ms. Warner's family for the show, which is due to air on Thursday . However, it has now emerged that during a two-hour interview with detectives, Castellano said he had taped an interview for the 'Dr. Phil' show on Friday. Houston Detective Fil Waters said: 'I thought he was kidding, but it was . the real deal. 'He talks to Dr. Phil, provides Dr. Phil . as I understand it, with the same information he's been providing . everyone else.' In a . brief statement, Stacey Luchs, a spokeswoman for the 'Dr. Phil' show . said: 'Mr. Castellano sat down for an interview with Dr. Phil in Texas . just before his confession to law enforcement, late last week. 'Dr. Phil also conducted an interview with Ms. Warner's family for this show, which is currently scheduled to air on Thursday.' The statement did not say what Castellano talked about during his interview. Roommates: Friends said Warner moved in with the father of her son because she was unemployed for 18 months . Dead: This map shows the huge distance between where Michelle Warner was last seen in Houston and where she was eventually found in Texas . Castellano initially told investigators . that Warner had run out on him and their 3-year-old son. Her family . later reported her missing to police. Castellano, who was staying with his son at his parents' home in Odessa in West Texas, had kept in contact with police and agreed to return to Houston on Sunday to speak with investigators. During a two-hour interview, Castellano told investigators he killed Warner after an argument in their apartment in which he grabbed her by the throat and apparently snapped her neck, Waters said. He is scheduled to have his initial court appearance today. Court records did not list an attorney for him. Waters said Castellano told investigators his son was in the apartment when he killed Warner but did not witness the slaying. Tragic: Castellano initially told investigators that Warner, pictured, had run out on him and their 3-year-old son. Her family later reported her missing to police . Afterwards, Castellano drove his son to this parents' home before returning to Houston for Warner's body, the detective said. He put it in a plastic container, placed that in Warner's car and then drove back to Odessa. 'He spends a day and a half trying to figure out what he is going to do with Michelle. She, in the meantime, is in the backseat of the car, which is parked at his parents' house,' Waters said. He added that Castellano's parents didn't know Warner's body was in the car outside their home. Eventually, Castellano decided to take the body to nearby Midland, where he dumped it in a ditch in an oil field, covering it with some dirt. 'His comment was, ""I didn't really try to hide her. I'm surprised you all haven't found her already,""' Waters said. Odessa police and FBI agents found the body. An autopsy is pending to confirm Warner's identity and determine the cause of death. 'Had he not confessed, we would still be stuck,' Waters said. 'His timeline was plausible. We had no physical evidence. We had our suspicions.' The couple had a history of fighting, he said. Friends and family said Miss Warner, 31, was last seen at the Regency Square Apartment Complex, where she lived with Castellano and their three-year-old son, Cayden. People close to Miss Warner described her as very bubbly and talkative, and said that she would have never severed communication with friends or taken off without her son. Miss Warner, who also has an 11-year-old daughter who lives with her father, was about to start a new job as a paralegal and was excited about working again after spending the last 18 months unemployed, Click2Houston reported. Her family said Warner moved in with Castellano for financial reasons, but the two were not currently dating. Longtime friend Stephanie Helton, who has been friends with Warner since grade school, told ABC that the relationship between Warner and Castellano has 'never been a good situation.' Ms Helton said the two met when all three of them were working for a home health care provider. In 2008, Warner became pregnant with Cayden, but the relationship with the father of her child was not going well because Castellano had 'psychotic spells.' Family: Warner has a three-year-old son, Cayden, . left, with Mark Castellano, and an 11-year-old daughter from a previous . relationship . Search efforts: A search effort was mounted for Warner while friends hung her pictures around the local neighborhood . 'He had episodes, he tried suicide ...,' she told ABC. 'He's done other crazy things. Nothing extra-violent; he's push[ed] her up against the wall, that type of thing. He's threatened her.' Ms Helton said that according to her friend's family member, at around 7pm last Saturday, Castellano and Warner got into a fight, during which the man threw their pet cat against a wall. The mother of two got upset and hit him before storming out of the apartment on Bellerive Drive. According to the woman's brother, fresh bleach stains were found on the carpet inside the unit leading from the bedroom through the living room and out the front door. The night of her disappearance, Warner went to dinner with a friend, Scott Russell. He dropped her off at the apartment complex afterward and left. She had not been seen since.

The boss of defence giant BAE Systems stands to make £18million almost overnight if the firm’s controversial merger goes through. Chief executive Ian King is sitting on millions of lucrative share options which would usually take years to mature. But in what critics branded a ‘scandalous’ twist, they would pay him the giant windfall straight away if the £30billion deal to combine forces with the French and German-controlled aerospace conglomerate EADS is approved. Profit: CEO Ian King stands to make millions from the possible merger with European company EADS . Details of Mr King’s potential payday . are now likely to be probed by the House of Commons Defence Select . Committee, which is holding an inquiry into the proposed merger. It . strengthens the claims of critics that a charmed circle of ministers, . company bosses, senior mandarins and former civil servants is engaged . in a stitch-up to push through the deal behind closed doors. Former MI6 boss Sir John Scarlett is . lobbying the Government on behalf of Morgan Stanley, the investment bank . which is expected to share in a multi-million pound payout for advising . BAE on the deal. Officials have also been forced to deny . that Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood, who used to work for Morgan . Stanley and has helped persuade David Cameron to support the deal, has . any conflict of interest. Money merger: The possible merger of BAE Systems and European aerospace conglomerate EADS is a £30 million deal from which Mr King is set to make £17.8 million . Contractors: BAE Systems is one of the world's largest deference contractors making fighter jets, defence systems and aircraft carriers, such as these two Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers . In addition, Liberal Democrat leader . Nick Clegg is also said to be supportive of the takeover which has come . under fierce criticism from senior backbenchers including Tory grandee . David Davis. Tory MPs . oppose the deal because they believe handing defence secrets to a . company partly controlled by the governments of France and Germany will . undermine national security, destroy the intelligence-sharing . relationship with the United States and cost British jobs. Opponents . point to recent reports from Paris and Berlin as proof that both France . and Germany are keen to retain a substantial stake of anything up to 27 . per cent between them in the proposed merged defence giant. Both companies are working towards an October 10 deadline for the submission of formal proposals for the deal. After . 36 years in the company, Mr King has built up extensive holdings of . shares and options through a web of executive reward schemes. He has more than one million BAE . shares in his portfolio, worth more than £3.36million at the current . price. In a merger, he would either receive at least that amount in cash . or the equivalent value in new shares in the combined group. Mr . King has also amassed options on around 4.5million shares in executive . reward schemes set to bear fruit over a number of years. But a deal with EADS could trigger a . ‘change of control’ clause set out in the company’s annual report, . meaning that they all pay out at once when the merger goes through. This . would hand him an instant jackpot of £14.5millon, taking his grand . total to £17.8million. It is not clear at this stage whether any or all of these sums will be paid out. Critics last night called on Mr King to waive the potential payouts. Jim . Moohan, of the GMB union, which represents the engineering and . shipbuilding industry in Scotland, said it was ‘scandalous’ that the . chief executive could receive the rewards. He . said: ‘From a moral position he must certainly give them up. I’m . surprised the political parties don’t come forward to stop these . rewards.’ He added: ‘This is a deal where people risk losing their jobs and their skills, and we can ill afford to go down this route. ‘We don’t want to be just a French player in two years’ time. This will be a backward step.’ Mr Moohan also warned that the deal was like a ‘runaway train’ and was out of the Government’s control. Mr . King’s future has not officially been decided because the two companies . are still working on details of the merger and have not yet made a . formal announcement on their top management team. But . well-placed sources say the boss of EADS, former German paratrooper Tom . Enders, is virtually certain to be shoe-horned in as chief executive, . leaving Mr King to play second fiddle. Mr King, who has been chief executive . of BAE since 2008, is said to be likely to stay on as head of a . British-based defence division. In that case he may decide not to cash . in on his lavish pile of shares and options. Nevertheless, he is still likely to be a big winner . Big benefit: During his 36 years Mr King has amassed options in an estimated 4.5 million shares in BAE Systems which means that he stands to make an instant profit of £14.5 million from the merger . In similar situations, other bosses involved in mega-mergers have tried instead to negotiate ‘retention deals’ granting them lucrative options to stay on. Mr King last year took home a basic salary and bonus of £2.4million, and benefited from maturing share options worth almost £700,000 awarded in earlier years. He is also on course for a feather-bedded retirement, regardless of whether he remains in post until the company’s normal pension age of 62 or steps down earlier. He has accumulated a pension pot worth more than £11.6million, which will pay him an income of just under £680,000 a year for the rest of his life.

A rare $5 bill presented to the U.S. Vice President in 1905 is expected to sell for a cool $300,000 at auction. The historic note was given to Charles Fairbanks - Theodore Roosevelt's No. 2 - by the First National Bank of Fairbanks, Alaska, as a memento from the frontier city named after him. It was one of only four notes of its kind in the $5 denomination that . were issued by the bank, and has been passed down the generations as a treasured family heirloom. Change for a five? This rare $5 bill, presented to Vice President Charles Fairbanks in 1905, is expected to sell for around $300,000 at auction . Treasure: The rare note was one of only four of its kind in the $5 denomination that were issued by the bank, and has been passed down the generations as a treasured family heirloom . For decades it took pride of place on the wall of the original owner's great grandson Charles Fairbanks IV, at his home in Santa Barbara, California. But after learning last year how its value had rocketed, Mr Fairbanks locked it away in a safety deposit box and has now taken the tough decision to put it up for auction. Charles Warren Fairbanks was a Senator from Indiana from 1897 to 1905 and served as the 26th Vice President of the United States between 1905 and 1909. The son of a wagon-maker, he was born in a log cabin near Delaware, Ohio. The family home later being used as a hiding place for runaway slaves. He attended Ohio Wesleyan University, where he co-edited the school newspaper with his future wife Cornelia Cole, before working for the Associated Press, reporting on political rallies. He moved to Cleveland, Ohio, attending law school before being admitted to the Ohio bar in 1874. His interest in politics began before the 1888 Republican National Convention, when federal judge Walter Q. Gresham sought his help, in his unsuccessful nomination for U.S. President. Fairbanks was elected as a Republican to the United States Senate in 1896. He served as a key adviser to McKinley during the Spanish-American War and was Chairman of the Committee on Immigration and the Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds. In 1898, he was appointed a member of the United States and British Joint High Commission which met in Quebec City for the adjustment of Canadian questions. He was credited with playing a key role to resolve a border dispute with Canada triggered by the Klondike Gold Rush. Fairbanks was elected Vice President of the United States in 1904 on the Republican ticket with Theodore Roosevelt and served all four years. He explained: 'Why stress out and worry about something? It'd be like having a Monet in the house.' The bill is due to be sold at Dallas-based Heritage Auctions as part of the American . Numismatic Association National Money Show later this month. A similar note sold for . close to $100,000 15 years ago and, according to Dustin Johnston, director of Heritage's currency auctions, the market has 'really picked up for the rarest . pieces'. Mr Johnson said: 'It's a wonderful, wonderful find . 'It's probably one of the better national bank notes that will come to auction over this decade. 'It's easily in the top five of what I've handled.' Auction officials say the Fairbanks bill that features an image of President Benjamin Harrison is a highlight that's expected to sell for $200,000 to $300,000. The minimum starting bid is $120,000. Fairbanks learned last year that the uncirculated note's estimated value had risen far beyond the estimate of $50,000 to $60,000 set in the mid-1990s, which prompted him to start locking it up whenever he traveled. Charles W. Fairbanks was a U.S. senator from Indiana in the late 1890s when he was credited with playing a key role to resolve a border dispute with Canada triggered by the Klondike Gold Rush. As a result of his efforts, most of the disputed territory went to the United States. But the real reason the city of Fairbanks was named after him was because he played a key role in the appointment of a federal judge, James Wickersham, a man Fairbanks met during the border dispute, according to University of Alaska Fairbanks historian Terrence Cole. To return the favor, Wickersham urged city founders to call the settlement Fairbanks. 'He said ""I owe everything that I am to him,""'' Cole said. Auction officials also note the bill's rarity. Only three banks in Alaska - out of more than 12,000 banks nationwide - issued the bills. A third bill is in storage at the University of Alaska Museum of the North in Fairbanks, collections manager of ethnology and history Angela Linn said Wednesday. The bill is in pristine condition and looks as if it just came off the printing press, she said, adding that its distinctive quirk is a curve in part of the edge.The bill being auctioned is unfolded and there is no wear, either, Johnston said. Its color is a little muted because the family displayed it for so long. There also have been some minor restorations to the back corners, but Johnston doesn't expect that to affect the selling price, given the bill's rarity, pedigree and history.","Historic note was presented to Charles Fairbanks - Theodore Roosevelt's No. 2 - in 1905 .

Gina Campbell has accused her father Donald Campbell (both pictured) of taking her trust money to fund his lavish lifestyle . She grew up in the shadow of greatness. But for the daughter of legendary speed icon Donald Campbell her upbringing was anything but great. In an autobiography due to be published next week 63-year-old Gina Campbell lays bare a tormented childhood and chronicles three failed marriages and a suicide attempt. She reveals how her father mysteriously emptied her trust fund before he tragically died in January 1967 on Coniston Water and how the debonair dare-devil sacrificed her and his family in the pursuit of glory. Yet, she does not blame him. Nor does she resent Bluebird K7, the speedboat that cart-wheeled so spectacularly across the water during that ill-fated world speed record attempt 45 years ago. ‘To a large degree it was a very hard childhood,’ she told the Mail yesterday. ‘I didn’t see it back then. I had nothing to compare it to. ‘The family life, the love and care of a mother and father just wasn’t there. ‘My mother didn’t even like me most of the time, let alone love me. ‘And my father never displayed any affection towards me, never put his arm around me, never sat me on his knee, never praised me. ‘Bluebird was always paramount in his thoughts, feelings and actions. It had to be. It was his tour de force, his raison d’etre. I was there and Bluebird was there and he chose Bluebird. ‘That’s not to say my father was a bad father. ‘I thought he was the best thing since sliced bread and amongst the low lows there were massive highs. But yes, some things were strange, different, unorthodox.’ Her autobiography, Daughter of Bluebird, documents her struggles growing up and how the lack of affection as an ‘unwanted child’ left her craving for love in later life. It also details the moment she learnt of her father’s death at the age of 45 in a phone call with her mother who could only utter the words: ‘There’s been a terrible accident’. Born in 1949 Georgina Dorothy Campbell was packed away to boarding school at the age of two. Gina Campbell picturerd with her father's mascot bear at a race in Poole in 1984 . Her father was already well-known and was travelling all over the world breaking records whilst her mother was far from maternal. ‘It must be the most difficult thing for any child to say: that she has no love, respect or true caring for her own mother,’ she writes. ‘But, even worse, that a mother holds no emotion for her own child. It is so unnatural. But sadly, in my case, this was the plain and simple truth. ‘When my parents divorced, I think when I was nearly two years old, my mother found a place for me at a boarding school-cum-residential home, where I lived for two to three years, 365 days of the year. ‘She could find no place in her life for her only child and this was the convenient alternative. ‘Apparently she was totally disappointed when her baby was a girl and I’m sure my father would have preferred a boy, too.’ Donald Campbell's Bluebird hydroplane at speed on Coniston Water in 1967 . Her parents divorced and in 1952 her father married again after a whirlwind romance. Yet he remained detached from his daughter and very rarely showed any signs of affection towards her – often criticising and belittling her. She recalls watching him on This is your Life in 1956 and adds: ‘I was almost detached watching him on television. Did I look at the programme and think: ‘That’s my daddy?’ I didn’t really know him. ‘In fact I don’t have a poignant memory of first meeting my father. ‘In fact, it seemed all he did was criticise, belittle me. ‘He criticised my laugh in particular, said I sounded like a bloody donkey and then he would mimic the ‘ee-ore, ee-ore’ sound. Maybe that’s why I don’t laugh out loud a lot now....’ She continues: ‘He was very strict about behaviour and manners too and a great believer in spanking. He used to exact that punishment quite regularly if I was naughty. ‘I was so scared if I knew it was that time again that I used to wee myself and he would tell me to go to the toilet and then to my room to wait for him. ‘Then he would come and administer the punishment. He used to put me across his knee and spank me with his hand on my bottom.’ 'My father used my trust money in the early days . but what he used it for I do not know - only he knows,' said Gina . (above, seeing her father off to Australia and, right, as she is today) In her teenage years she went to a succession of boarding schools and in the holidays would travel to Australia and America to watch her father’s speed record attempts. She was also packed off to France to stay with family friends. By January 1967 her father, onto his third marriage to a cabaret singer, was at Lake Coniston attempting to break his own world speed record in Bluebird K7 whilst she was working in Switzerland at a ski resort. She was 17 at the time and can remember the telephone call telling her that her father had been killed during the second leg of his latest world record attempt, at more than 300 mph. ‘My mother arranged my flight home and the next day the housekeeper took me to Geneva airport which was about 200 miles away - it’s still all a bit of a haze,’ she writes. ‘It was strange, surreal. I have vivid memories of sitting in the departure hall opposite a news stand where every single British paper and even the French ones had the picture of Bluebird going up in to the air. ‘I looked at them with a total sense of disbelief.’ Gina (above) describes Mr Campbell, who remains the only person to set both world land and water speed records in the same year, as a strict and 'very distant' father . Within a year Miss Campbell was engaged to the first of her three husbands and had already had an abortion. Then, in 1984, in an attempt to emulate her father’s success on water, she too attempted a world speedboat record – and miraculously walked away from a crash that was almost identical to his. There was further heartbreak to come. With her third marriage crumbling she took an overdose of painkillers in a bid to end her life. Then, in December 2000, she received the news she never thought would come. Almost 34 years after the tragic crash a diver had found Bluebird K7 – and her father – at the bottom of Coniston Water. ‘When my father’s body was finally recovered, still inside his suit, there had to be DNA testing, even though we had established it was his St Christopher and lighter,’ writes Miss Campbell, who now lives in Leeds. ‘A policeman came to my house and took a mouth swab and the result came back that the chances of our not being related were at least two million to one.’ Donald Campbell was eventually laid to rest whilst his daughter and a team of experts set about restoring BlueBird K7 to her former glory. They now intend to launch her one more time onto Coniston. World speed record breaker Donald Campbell pictured in 1966 . Donald .

Production of Apple's iPhone 5 may have been severely impacted after thousands of factory workers in China went on strike over working on a national holiday and increasing pressures to improve the product's quality. Between 3,000 and 4,000 staff were involved in the strike which reportedly left multiple iPhone 5 . production lines 'in a state of . paralysis for the entire day'. There are fears the mass protest may have seriously impacted output at the factory, which houses multiple production lines and buildings each piecing together the latest Apple technology, which is in high demand globally following its release last month. Scroll down for video . Foxconn, pictured during a jobs fair in in southern China earlier this year, denies that production has been affected following reports of a mass strike over iPhone 5 manufacturing conditions . According to New . York-based China Labor Watch (CLW), a workers' rights organisation, the protests began Friday lunchtime after arguments and fights broke . out between quality control inspectors and factory workers. The organisation reported that staff were unhappy about having to work during a national holiday. From October 1-8 is the national Golden Week holiday in China. Manufacturer Foxconn, which operates the central China factory that produces Apple's iPhone 5, required staff in the ZhengZhou site work during this time to meet high demand for the new phone. In addition, CLW said: 'Foxconn raised overly strict . demands on product quality without providing worker training for the . corresponding skills.' 'This combination of factors led to the strike,' the agency said. CWL did point out that on Friday, since it was a national holiday in China, Foxconn paid staff three times their normal pay. Foxconn denied that there had been any disturbance to production. Since the launch of the new iPhone 5, . there have been numerous reports of complaints over damaged sets, which . have reportedly been scratched and dented. In response, Foxconn imposed stricter quality control measures. This resulted in hand-sets failing quality standards checks carried out by controllers. CLW said factory workers started fighting with quality control staff and a number of them were badly beaten. Refusing to put up with the conditions, thousands of quality control staff then went on strike, the agency said. CLW Executive Director Li Qiang said: 'This strike is a result of the fact that these workers just have too much pressure.' 'Factory management turned a deaf ear to complaints about these conflicts and took no corrective measures. 'The result of both of these circumstances was a widespread work stoppage on the factory floor among workers and inspectors,' CLW said.

The death toll has risen to seven from a 'rapidly evolving outbreak' of rare fungal meningitis that has been linked to spinal steroid injections, sparking fear as new cases have been reported in nine U.S. states. The potential scope of the meningitis outbreak, that has sickened 64 people, widened dramatically as health officials warned that hundreds, perhaps thousands, of patients who received steroid back injections in 23 states could be at risk. The outbreak of the disease, known as aspergillus meningitis, is caused by a fungus found in a spinal steroid injections, a fairly common treatment used to relieve back pain, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Beware: Health officials warned that hundreds, perhaps thousands, of patients who received steroid back injections in 23 states could be at risk (stock photo) The latest fatalities were reported in Michigan on Saturday, though the Michigan Department of Community Health said they would not provide more information on the two deaths until after the weekend. The fifth victim, Diana Reed, died on Wednesday afternoon at St Thomas Hospital in Nashville, Tennessee, surrounded by family members. Mrs . Reed, 56, is one of thousands of patients recently treated in Tennessee . hospitals for back pain with a steroid epidural - a fairly typical . treatment. But since then a tainted batch of steroids released across . the U.S. has been linked to dozens of cases of fungal meningitis. Mrs Reed, of Brentwood, Tennessee, was the fifth person to succumb to the infection. A blog written by a close friend of Reed's family, Brandon Scott Thomas, characterized her as 'hilarious, beautiful, and full of life' and praised her for carrying for husband Wayne Reed after he was diagnosed with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - more commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease - almost 20 years ago. 'Over the course of the last week she has gone from someone brimming with life to someone in the process of passing from this life to the next,' wrote. 'Her brain couldn't take the stress. After a series of strokes they moved her to hospice care. Wayne, one of the longest surviving patients with ALS, there by her side.' Reed served on the board of her husband's namesake child care organization, the Wayne Reed Christian Child Care Center. The caretaker: Diana Reed dedicated her life to helping underprivileged children before a routine medical procedure infected her with a rare fungal meningitis . Source: The outbreak of the deadly form of meningitis was traced to St Thomas Hospital in Nashville, Tennessee . The injectable steroids responsible . for Reed's death were produced by New England Compounding Center, a . specialized pharmacy in Framingham, Massachusetts. The company has shut down operations and said it is working with regulators to identify the source of the infection. It is not clear how many patients received tainted injections, or even whether everyone who got one will get sick. So far, 64 people in nine states - Tennessee, Virginia, Maryland, Florida, North Carolina, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota and Ohio - have contracted fungal meningitis, and five have died, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In an alarming indication that the outbreak . could get a lot bigger, Massachusetts health officials said the pharmacy . involved, the New England Compounding Center of Framingham, has . recalled three lots consisting of a total of 17,676 single-dose vials of . the steroid, preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate. No solicitors: Specialized pharmacy New England Compounding Center has hidden from the public as its steroids are linked to multiple deaths and critical infections . An unknown number of those vials reached 75 clinics and other facilities in 23 states between July and September, federal health officials said. Several hundred of the vials, maybe more, have been returned unused, one Massachusetts official said. However many other vials were used. At one clinic in Evansville, Indiana, more than 500 patients got shots from the suspect lots, officials said. At two clinics in Tennessee, more than 900 patients received them. The incubation period before symptoms appear is 28 days, and its almost certain more cases will be reported say health officials, who are now calling this a national health crisis. Tennessee: The initial outbreak site with a suspected 16 cases, two of whom are in critical condition. Three others have already died. North Carolina: The second state to report infection with one case found at an unidentified clinic. Florida: Only two cases have been reported but health officials fear more may come forward. Virginia: One person has died from fungal meningitis and three more cases are still being treated. Maryland: Seven medical clinics in Maryland pulled their stock of a questionable steroid after one person died and two more cases were reported. Indiana: At least five people in Indiana are sick with fungal meningitis, with no fatalities yet reported . Michigan: There are at least eight confirmed cases of meningitis in Michigan, including two deaths . Minnesota: Fungal meningitis has been diagnosed in two women hospitalized in Minnesota . Ohio: Health officials reported Saturday of a 65-year-old man being treated for the meningitis after receiving the steroid . Unlike the more common viral and bacterial meningitis, fungal meningitis is not contagious. It is an inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms include a severe headache, nausea, fever, and dizziness. The first patients identified in Tennessee experienced slurred speech, and difficulty walking and urinating. The pharmacy voluntarily recalled three lots of the steroid Methylprednisolone Acetate on September 26 according to the FDA. The drug is primarily used to relieve back pain. The drug was administered to patients in their late 40s to early 80s. Tennessee's S. Thomas Hospital, ground zero for the outbreak with a suspected 15 cases as of Wednesday with two in critical condition, reported having 2,000 vials of the steroid in stock before the threat was discovered. 'Some are doing well and improving. Some are very ill - very, very . seriously ill and may die,' Tennessee health official Dr. David Reagan . said. In Tennessee alone roughly 1,000 people were administered the steroid. The link between the injections and the . meningitis was discovered by Tennessee physician April Pettit, who found . the initial cases were all people who'd recently received an epidural. Officials are still investigating how the steroid resulted in fungal meningitis. New England Compounding Center . released a statement promising to work with heath authorities to . discover what happened. But company president and licensed pharmacist . Barry J. Cadden has otherwise dodged interview requests and the company . web site is down. An archived version of the site notes the company is licensed to distribute drugs in every U.S. state. Critical condition: Tennessee health official Dr. David Reagan says the infected are 'very, very seriously ill and may die' New England Compounding Center is among the approximately 3,000 U.S. compounding pharmacies specializing in blending, liquefying, or combining medicines customized for patients unable to swallow tablets, require specific dosages, or who have allergies. Such companies are regulated by the . state boards of pharmacy that license them rather than facing the . broader regulations traditional drug companies deal with. The pharmacy has produced questionable . products before. In 2006, New England Compounding Center was one of . four companies ordered by the the Food and Drug Administration to cease . producing a topical anesthetic cream that was found to cause 'grave . reactions including seizures and irregular heartbeats.' The cream was the cause of two deaths, neither tied directly to New England Compounding Center. Ground zero: The first patients of the fungal meningitis were reported at St. Thomas Hospital which had roughly 2,000 vials of a dangerous steroid on stock . That same year the company was also cited for multiple violations of federal laws and regulations based on a 2004 review of its offices. They were charged with misbranding drugs prescribed for eye treatment, misbranding an anesthetic drug and failing to provide adequate directions for its use, and promoting the use of a cancer drug for an unapproved purpose. An FDA warning letter admonished the company that it was 'distributing an unapproved drug in violation' of federal regulations. In 2010 the company was sued by an Illinois firm that alleged New England Compounding Center illegally hacked its database violating the federal computer computer fraud and abuse act. The case was eventually settled.","Two more deaths have been reported in Michigan, bringing the total death toll to seven .

The Scots and Northern Irish are happier than the English and the Welsh, David Cameron's well-being survey has concluded. It found 29 per cent of those in England and Wales gave themselves low happiness ratings, against 28.8 per cent of Scots and 26 per cent of people in Northern Ireland. And those living in the Orkneys, the Shetlands and the Western Isles were the happiest of all, the survey's first annual report has shown. The islanders gave their happiness level eight out of ten, and fewer than one in six gave low scores for life satisfaction. London and Birmingham were the most miserable cities while York was the happiest, with 83 per cent of its residents reporting medium or high satisfaction with life. The survey found that the middle-aged are the unhappiest people in the country. They are at the bottom of a U-shaped pattern of national happiness, while the young and the retired each came at the top. Good results: Pensioners and teenagers are the happiest in Britain, according to results of a Government survey released today, which is costing £2 million . The report, . released yesterday, found that those in their 40s and 50s were . unhappier, more dissatisfied and more likely to feel anxious than . teenagers or pensioners. The £2million-a-year inquiry into . Britain’s emotional well-being was commissioned by Mr Cameron and . carried out by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Happy bunny: David Cameron wants to find out how Britons really feel so the Government can do a better job . It has already been criticised for . some of its initial findings, including the rather predictable . conclusions that the employed are happier than the unemployed and those . who suffer poor health are more anxious than those in good health. Yesterday a Labour spokesman said: . ‘This is a statement of the bleeding obvious, a waste of taxpayers’ money and it makes ministers look even more out of touch.’ The 165,000 participants were asked . how happy and anxious they felt the day before, how satisfied they were . with life and how worthwhile they thought their lives were. The findings show that the middle-aged are the worst-off generation in terms of well-being. ‘Research has shown a U-shaped relationship between life satisfaction ratings and age group,’ the report said. ‘Overall higher ratings of subjective . well-being are reported by younger and older people, and lower ratings . are reported by those in the middle years.’ Men and women aged between 45 and 54 rated their life satisfaction at 7.1 out of ten. By contrast, teenagers and those between 65 and 80 marked themselves at 7.8 out of ten. When it came to anxiety, the U-shape . was turned upside down. Nearly a quarter of those aged between 45 and 60 . gave an anxiety rating of six out of ten. But bearing a greater level of responsibility gave the middle-aged a sense their lives were worthwhile. Ros Altmann, of Saga, the over-50s . group,  said: ‘Those coming up to traditional retirement age are clearly . more anxious and less satisfied with their lives than those already . retired. ‘Once they are retired, perhaps people adjust to their circumstances and make the best of things.’ Lord O'Donnell, the former Cabinet Secretary behind the survey, said the results showed it is 'bliss' to work outdoors. He added that the findings proved it isn't just money that matters. 'If you are working in forestry, or in agriculture, then you really are close to bliss,' he said. On average, Britons rated life satisfaction at 7.4 out of ten. Those who were married were the most satisfied, with 82 per cent recording medium to high levels. Cohabitees came next, on 79.4 per cent, followed by single people, on 71.2 per cent, and the divorced, on 60.7 per cent. But the ONS said it was 'difficult to say' whether marriage makes people happier, or happier people are more likely to marry.

Man began hunting with stone-tipped spears half a million years ago - 200,000 years earlier than previously thought, according to a new study. Scientists have discovered our ancestors began hunting with stone-tipped spears 500,000 years ago - with the help of a special crossbow and a dead springbok. Up until recently, it was thought attaching a stone tip to a spear - known as 'hafting' - started about 300,000 years ago. Experimental hafted points from a University of Toronto-led study created by researchers to test how effective spears were . However, by comparing the wear visible on 500,000-year-old stone points found in South Africa with modern experimental points fired by a specially calibrated crossbow at a springbok carcass, scientists proved they had been used as spear tips for hunting. 'Hafting' was an important technological advance that made it possible to handle or throw sharp points with much more power and control. Leader author Jayne Wilkins, a PhD candidate in the Department of Anthropology at the University of Toronto in Canada, said the research suggested stone-tipped spears could have been in use before the divergence of early humans and Neanderthals. She said: 'This changes the way we think about early human adaptations and capacities before the origin of our own species. 'Although both Neanderthals and humans used stone-tipped spears, this is the first evidence that the technology originated prior to or near the divergence of these two species.' Attaching stone points to spears was an important advance in hunting weaponry for early humans. A 500,000 spear tip found in Kathu Pan 1 in South Africa . The team built a catapult to test how effective the spear making technique was . Hafted tools require more effort and planning to manufacture, but a sharp stone point on the end of a spear can increase its killing power. Hafted spear tips are common in Stone Age archaeological sites after 300,000 years ago. The new study - which examined 500,00-year-old stone points from the South African archaeological site of Kathu Pan 1- shows that they were also used in the early Middle Pleistocene, a period associated with Homo heidelbergensis, the last common ancestor of Neandertals, and modern humans. Ms Wilkins and colleagues from Arizona State University and the University of Cape Town, compared the ancient stone points to experimental points which they hafted to wooden dowels using Acacia resin and sinew before thrusting them into a springbok with a mounted crossbow. The method has been used effectively to study weaponry from more recent contexts in the Middle East and southern Africa. The . stone points exhibit certain types of breaks that occur more commonly . when they are used to tip spears compared to other uses. 'The archaeological points have . damage that is very similar to replica spear points used in our spearing . experiment,' said Ms Wilkins. The researchers tested hundreds of stones to find those which were effective as spear tips . 'This type of damage is not easily created through other processes. 'It now looks like some of the traits that we associate with modern humans and our nearest relatives can be traced further back in our lineage.' The findings were published in the journal Science.","500,000 year-old tips were found in South Africa .

Radiation is something we usually think we want to avoid, but in fact every second thousands of tiny isotopes are bursting with radioactive decay right inside your body. At the same time, all around you imperceptible gamma rays are exploding in an invisible light show. Now a group of musicians-cum-scientists has harnessed the activity of this low-level radiation to compose music - and perform live using a lump of uranium on stage. The spectra signature of cobalt 60: A group of musicians-cum-scientists has harnessed the activity of this low-level radiation to compose music . Swedish musician Kristofer Hagbard conceived of the Radioactive Orchestra about a year ago and last spring the group released their first album. But now he has taken the project to the next level with a live performance. Mr Hagbard performs his live concerts by moving a small, low-activity sample of radioactive material back and forth near a gamma spectrometer, creating a pulsating rhythm. Using the live isotope signatures in conjunction with live audio performance software he can quickly create repeating loops and build them into the kinds of tracks you might hear in Dutch nightclub. Mr Hagbard worked with nuclear physicists to create algorithms that translates the way gamma radiation is emitted from various isotopes into sequences of tones. Consisting of photons, gamma radiation is essentially the same kind of radiation as light and radio waves, but with a much higher level of energy. It is present all around us, and indeed within us, sometimes from naturally occurring sources and other times from man-made sources, the Radioactive Orchestra explain on their website. Kristofer Hagbard performing at Stockholm's Nobel Museum: He performs his live concerts by moving a small, low-activity sample of radioactive material back and forth near a gamma spectrometer, creating a pulsating rhythm . Gamma radiation is high frequency and high energy electromagnetic radiation often produced by the decay of atomic nuclei. Discovered in 1900 by French chemist and physicist Paul Villard, they are a form of ionising radiation and are as a result biologically hazardous. Natural sources of gamma rays on Earth include gamma decay from naturally occurring radioisotopes, and secondary radiation from atmospheric interactions with cosmic ray particles. All ionizing radiation causes similar damage at a cellular level, but gamma rays are particularly hazardous since they are more penetrating, causing damage throughout the body. Effects can include radiation sickness, cell DNA damage, cell death due to damaged DNA, and increasing incidence of cancer. Tim Lundström, a physicist at Swedish nuclear safety and training organization KSU, told Fox News the method correlates accurately to what science understands about radioactive material. 'The decay of Cobalt-60 gives gamma-radiation of two very distinct energy levels, 1.17 MeV and 1.33 MeV. These numbers can be translated to two different tones,' Mr Lundström told the U.S. news broadcaster. The Radioactive Orchestra album was produced in collaboration with music producer Axel Boman, who created songs based on melodies and sounds from the software. The group say on their website: 'The musical and artistic ambition [of the project] is about exploring a world that is not available to our senses and finding musically interesting pattens and to render them in a way that both resonates with popular culture while staying close to the subject matter. 'The pedagogical aspect aims to inspire young people to learn about the natural sciences by making one of its most hidden phenomena available in a new way and exposing complexity and beauty in the strange world of the atomic nuclei – using music.'","The Radioactive Orchestra harnesses gamma rays to compose music .

A ‘homeless planet’ which floats through space without orbiting a star had been discovered for the first time. Scientists have speculated on the existence of such a planet and have been trawling the night skies for more than a decade, although the hunt was described as looking for a ‘needle in a thousand haystacks’. The isolated planet, which astronomers believe may have been flung away during its formation, is not tied by gravity to a star and in 100 light years away. An artist's impression shows the free-floating planet CFBDSIR J214947, the 'loneliest planet' without a star. The planet is called CFBDSIR2149 and appears to be part of a group of very young stars known as the AB Doradus Moving Group. It is 100 light years away from our solar system . University of Montreal (UdeM) researchers working with European colleagues and data provided by the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) and the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope (VLT) came across the huge discovery. Itienne Artigau, an astrophysicist at UdeM, said: 'Although theorists had established the existence of this type of very cold and young planet, one had never been observed until today.' The absence of a shining star in the area around this planet enabled the team to study its atmosphere in great detail. This information will in turn enable astronomers to better understand planets that do orbit stars. 'Over the past few years, several objects of this type have been identified, but their existence could not be established without scientific confirmation of their age,' said Jonathan Gagni, a doctoral student of physics at UdeM. 'Astronomers weren’t sure whether to categorise them as planets or as Brown Dwarfs. 'Brown dwarfs are what we could call failed stars, as they never manage to initiate nuclear reactions in their centres.' This closeup of an image captured by the La Silla Observatory shows the free-floating planet CFBDSIR J214947.2-040308.9 in infrared light. The planet is called CFBDSIR2149 and appears to be part of a group of very young stars known as the AB Doradus Moving Group. It is between 50 and 120 million years old, with a temperature of approximately 400 degrees celsius, and weighs four to seven times that of Jupiter. The study’s findings support theories that suggest these kinds of isolated objects are more common than currently believed. Astrophysicist Ms Artigau, who also worked on the study, said: 'This object was discovered during a scan that covered the equivalent of 1,000 times the surface of the full moon. 'We observed hundreds of millions of stars and planets, but we only found one homeless planet in our neighbourhood. 'Now we will be looking for them amongst an astronomical number of sources further afield. 'It’s like looking for a single needle in amongst thousands of haystacks.'

Officers were attacked with beer bottles and saw their vehicles smashed after being called to the party in Holland . Park on Brisbane's southside on Friday night. More than 500 people attended the gathering which was organised through Facebook. Packed party: The host of a Facebook party which ended in violent street chaos after it was shut down by police has vowed not to stop organising parties . 'I've learnt a lesson, but I'm not going to stop holding parties,' said one of the hosts, who gave his name as Ayad Fadil, 17, to the Courier Mail. 'But not at the house. I just want to say sorry again.' He told ABC News that he had hired 16 security guards for the event and attendees were charged 45-$10 entry. In the days before the party, a note was dropped into houses in Beddoes Street reading: . 'Dear neighbour, This is to inform you I will be hosting my sister's 16th birthday party. Warning: Before the party, a note was dropped into neigbours's homes in Beddoes St . 'There will be moderate music playing from 7pm to roughly 11pm. I hope this does not cause too much inconvenience to your night.' A number was also attached informing neighbours: 'If you have any concerns, please contact me,' and a number was written down. The host admitted that he had invited 200 people because his mother was at work, but the party invites had spread. Neighbours called police at 7pm, but according to authorities a large number of the people became unruly and started damaging vehicles and smashing bottles . It took police an hour to clear revellers from the party and two of their vehicles had to be towed from the scene. A neighbour told the Australian it was 'disgusting to watch' as the party-goers turned against police. 'What a huge drain on police resources when they could be doing something more meaningful,' she said. 'It's just obscene and so surprising for our area. Another neighbour Rashad Ali said there was also a party the previous week at the same house with more than 100 guests. He told ABC News the police presence seemed to agitate the crowd. 'Before the cops came the party was going good - [nobody] got injured, no bottles were thrown - but as soon as they came it was a whole different story,' he said. On Saturday morning council workers cleaned streets covered in broken glass. Metro South acting Detective Superintendent Geoff Sheldon told Courier Mail police . were investigating the party.

Pleading: Turkish President Abdullah Gul begged the international community to do more to end Syria's conflict to avoid 'more bloodshed and before Syria self-destructs more than it already has' Turkey's president described its growing conflict with Syria as 'the worst-case scenario we have all been dreading' as they retaliated with artillery fire into the country for a sixth successive day. Turkish President Abdullah Gul called on the international community to do more to try to end Syria's nearly 19-month-old conflict, which has claimed more than 30,000 lives and — with Turkey-Syria tensions rising — heightened fears of a regional conflagration. U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon on Monday warned that the escalating conflict on the Syrian-Turkish border is 'extremely dangerous'. The main Syrian opposition group, meanwhile, signaled it is softening its position on possible talks to arrange a political transition. In the past, the Syrian National Council has said that President Bashar Assad and his inner circle must step down before such talks can begin. However, the SNC chief said Monday that talks would be possible with members of the regime who do not have blood on their hands. In the latest cross-border incident, a Syrian artillery shell fell on Turkey's border province of Hatay on Monday, the provincial governor's office said. The state-run Anadolu news agency said the round landed in a cotton field near the town of Altinozu. People were working in the field but no one was injured, Anadolu said. Turkey retaliated Monday, as it did on five previous days, the governor's office said. Last week, after deadly cross-border shelling, Ankara warned Assad that it will respond to each shell or mortar round that hits Turkish soil. Turkey also sent more artillery to hotspots along the troubled border on Monday, Turkish media reported. The persistent Syrian shelling suggests the cross-border fire of recent days is not accidental. Turkey, along with other foreign allies of the Syrian opposition, is reluctant to intervene militarily in Syria, and Damascus' military strategy relies, in part, on the high threshold for foreign intervention. Standing guard: Turkish soldiers in Akcakale by the Turkish-Syria border. In the latest cross-border incident, a Syrian artillery shell fell on Turkey's border province of Hatay today . Gul, the Turkish president, described Syria's civil war and its regional impact as the 'worst-case scenario that we've all been dreading,' adding that along with the suffering of the Syrian people, 'once in a while we're also affected.' Speaking to reporters in Ankara, Gul also said the situation in Syria must not be allowed to continue. 'Sooner rather than later there will be change, a transition,' he said. 'Our only hope is that this happens before more blood is shed, and before Syria self-destructs more than it already has. It's also crucial that the international community act in a more effective way.' Efforts to get the two sides to negotiate a peaceful transition have failed up to now. However, the head of the SNC, Abdulbaset Sieda, said Monday he would not oppose a role for members of Assad's ruling Baath party in the country's political future as long as they did not participate in killings during the uprising. He told The Associated Press that the SNC will meet next week in Qatar and will discuss, among other things, the possibility of Vice President Farouk al-Sharaa serving as interim leader if Assad were to step down. Explosion: An injured police officer lies near an explosion area after several Syrian shells crashed inside Akcakale on Wednesday . Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said Saturday that al-Sharaa was a figure 'whose hands are not contaminated in blood' and therefore acceptable to Syrian opposition groups. 'We are with any solution that stops the killings in Syria and respects the ambitions of the Syrian people in what guarantees that there will be no return to dictatorship and tyranny in Syria,' Sieda said by telephone from Turkey. When asked about al-Sharaa, Sieda said: 'We have no information that he participated in the killings or gave orders but he belongs to the political leadership.' Syrian officials have said that Assad will remain in his post until his 7-year term ends in 2014, followed by an election that is expected to pit Assad against other candidates. Ban, speaking to the World Forum for Democracy in France, said the U.N.-Arab League envoy to Syria, Lakhdar Brahimi, would return to the region this week to continue international efforts seeking a political transition in Syria. Fire: The cross-border tensions escalated on Wednesday after a shell fired from inside Syria landed on a home in the Turkish village of Akcakale . Border guards: A boy rides a horse past Turkish soldiers near the Turkish-Syria border in Akcakale, southern Sanliurfa province . Sieda said the Syrian opposition will not repeat a policy carried out in Iraq years ago when members of Saddam Hussein's Baath party were forced to leave their jobs after his government was overthrown in the 2003 U.S.-led invasion. De-Baathification, a concept started under the U.S.-led Coalition Provisional Authority which ruled Iraq after the invasion, was an Iraqi government policy of trying to purge important government jobs and positions of former mid- and high-ranking members of the Baath party. 'We will not repeat the failed experience of de-Baathification,' Sieda said. 'We will just remove all its (Baath party's) illegitimate privileges and officials who committed crimes will be put on trial.' 'The Baath party will practice its activities in accordance with the democratic process. We will not have a revenge policy and we will preserve state institutions,' he said. Border watch: Five Turkish civilians were killed by Syrian shelling on Wednesday . Activists reported violence in different parts of the country, mostly in the central city of Homs, the northern city of Aleppo, and the southern region of Daraa. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based activist group, said 20 people were killed in the southern village of Karak, which has been attacked by government troops. It said the 20 were killed when vehicles transporting wounded people were targeted by troops. Meanwhile, residents of the Turkish border town of Akcakale, struck repeatedly by shelling from Syria, said they fear for their safety, even though Turkish troops have deployed to the area. 'If this shelling is going to continue day in and day out, we can't live here. We are not safe, our property is not safe,' said Hamit Ciftcioglu, whose jewelry store is just 75 meters (yards) from where a mortar round hit Sunday . Last week, officials decided to re-open schools that had been closed for weeks due to dangerous conditions. But children who lined up Monday morning found they had nowhere to go. 'They told us schools would reopen on Monday. So we sent our children to schools this morning but unfortunately they had to come back. They told us the schools were still closed,' said Isa Tokdemir, a father of two.","Abdullah Gul said, along with the suffering of the Syrian people, 'once in a while we're also affected' and called for Syrian conflict to be stopped .

Province, in March 2008. A daisy chain is two or more bombs . wired together and concealed by the Taliban on the side of a path to . maximise casualties among soldiers on patrol. On alert: Treo was responsible for saving many lives by detecting around 46 bombs during his six-month tour of Afghanistan in 2008 . Perfect pairing: According to the Army, his actions have also saved other soldiers and civilians from death or serious injury . In September 2008, Treo saved another platoon from guaranteed casualties when he again found a daisy chain. According to the Army, his actions have also saved other soldiers and civilians from death or serious injury. It can be common practice for handlers to request another dog if they believe they’ve got too close to their charge but Mr Heyhoe told the Sunday Times he would not swap Treo. 'You have to understand each other, recognise the slightest change in each other.' 'The trick is to channel your fear, knowing that this will make both you and the dog concentrate better. Although he was a black dog in 50C heat, I never doubted him.' During the tour, only one man was . killed, Justin Cupples, 29, who was Mr Heyhoe’s roommate. The Taliban took the opportunity to activate another hidden explosive just after an incident which had left Heyhoe and Treo out of action . As he dealt with the death of his friend Heyhoe described himself as a 'broken man.' Support: Sergeant David Heyhoe with Treo and two of his comrades . Man's best friend: Dave Heyhoe and Treo pictured in Afghanistan . He returned to Britain and retired from the army, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. But he credits Treo with helping him through the darker days: 'He’s a proper dog who never gives kisses, but the times when I needed him, he’d sit beside me. He knew when I was suffering.' Both Prince Charles and Gordon Brown . have been introduced to the Labrador on his return to Britain from his . many six-month tours of duty. In 2009 Treo was honoured with the . Dickin Medal from the People’s Dispensary for Sick Animals for his . conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. Sgt Heyho accompanied Treo to the award ceremony at the Imperial . War Museum in London, describing Treo as his ‘mate and best canine . friend’. PDSA director general Jan McLoughlin said at the time: ‘We look forward to honouring Treo with the Dickin Medal. Fresh start: Treo can now enjoy his retirement in Congleton away from the dust and danger of Helmand . Happy retirement: These days Treo's biggest task is playing fetch with his master . Two of a kind: After Mr Heyhoe returned to Britain with post-traumatic stress disorder, he says his dog helped him through . 'It is recognised throughout the world as the animals’ Victoria Cross. Treo is without doubt a worthy recipient.’ A Defence source said: ‘There is no doubt that Treo has saved many, many lives through his expertise.’ The life of a sniffer dog and his handler is fraught with danger and last month an Army dog was posthumously awarded the PDSA Dickin Medal . Theo, a 22-month-old springer spaniel cross suffered a fatal seizure just hours after his handler, Lance Corporal Liam Tasker, 26, was shot dead by the Taliban in March 2011. The pair uncovered 14 bombs and hoards of weapons in five months on the front line - more than any other dog and handler in the conflict.

Victims of crime will be able to decide how the offender is punished under sweeping justice reforms unveiled today. In an exclusive Daily Mail interview, Theresa May said home and property owners should no longer be powerless in the face of yobbery. The Home Secretary, who delivered a speech at the Tory party conference today, is planning a law change to make police and crime commissioners use a ‘menu’ of penalties for anti-social behaviour. Picking punishment: In an exclusive Daily Mail interview, Theresa May said home and property owners should no longer be powerless in the face of yobbery . Theresa May wore her trademark glamorous footwear to deliver her speech at the Tory party conference in Birmingham . 'It may be that they want reparation for the damage that was done, so if a window has been broken they want it fixed,' said the Home Secretary . The punishments are likely to include the payment of compensation, repair of damage and cleaning up a public space. The victim will be able to decide which one is imposed. They have never had a direct say over how their tormentor is dealt with. ‘One . of the big problems for the victims of anti-social behaviour is that . they feel powerless,’ said Mrs May. ‘Somebody does something to them or . their property and they feel they don’t get reparation, or feel they are . not part of the process. ‘We want to ensure that they have a . choice. It will mean saying to the victim: here’s a list of options, . what do you want to do? They may choose to go down the restorative . route, and that they want someone to say sorry. ‘It may be that they want reparation for the damage that was done, so if a window has been broken they want it fixed. ‘It may be that they want an offender to do something not immediately in relation to them, but for the community.’ Mrs May said some offenders were not even aware of the impact of their actions – and had to have the effects made clear. She . added: ‘It’s also about giving victims transparency. One of the . complaints I hear very regularly from victims is that they have reported . an incident to the police but they don’t know what happens after that. It’s about putting the victim first. They’ve suffered and they should . have a say in what happens.’ The new power, outlined to the Tory conference today, has been named the ‘community remedy’. It will be used for low-level crimes, such as criminal damage, which would normally be dealt with by a caution. Police . and crime commissioners, who will be elected for the first time in each . police force area in England and Wales next month, will be at the . centre of the new system. If the offender refused to accept the conditions offered, the alternative would be court proceedings. It is hoped the new regime will add bite to cautions, which are currently dismissed as a ‘slap on the wrist’. Last year, 232,000 were handed out – 4,700 of them for criminal damage. The new policy could also give a much needed boost to the idea of elected police commissioners. David Cameron’s flagship law and order measure has met with a lack of public enthusiasm. There are predictions the turnout for the commissioner elections could be as low as 20 per cent. The officials will have the power to set police priorities and budgets. In her speech, Mrs May restated . the government’s commitment to slash net migration – currently more than . 200,000 – to the ‘tens of thousands’. The . Home Secretary is also considering plans to scrap the Human Rights Act . after revealing it is responsible for delaying a deportation or . extradition case every day. Mrs May's get tough message on crime was applauded by Tory conference delegates . She has ordered her own study into replacing it with a bill of rights and responsibilities. It . will be seen as a vote of no confidence in the Coalition’s ‘Commission . on a Bill of Rights’, which was supposed to  end the abuse of human . rights law. Critics say . the panel has been hijacked by liberals determined to defend the status . quo. It recently considered enshrining in law the right to claim . benefits.","In an exclusive Daily Mail interview, Theresa May said home and property owners should no longer be powerless in the face of yobbery .

Larry Greenfield has been looking for a bride for the last 12 years by using six different dating services with no luck . But the matchmakers claim Mr Greenfield wants women who are simply out of his league. Mr Greenfield, who retired after a successful career at Opus Trading in Jericho, Long Island, says he would gladly trade his riches in exchange for finding love. But the lucky woman needs to meet his exacting standards. She must be beautiful, thin, smart, Jewish, have a sense of humor and be from New York. Speaking to the New York Post, Mr Greenfield said: 'New York is a tough market for a guy like me. I thought I get the career, then I find the woman. 'I'd trade it all in for a white picket fence, two kids, a dog. And you can have it all! I'd take a $50,000-a-year job, work until I retire.' 'I'm not a bad guy. I haven't been to prison,' he said. 'It's just a very frustrating thing.' Serious Matchmaking's Janis Spindel (website pictured) said she's reluctant to take Mr Greenfield on as a client because she's worried that his dream girl isn't in her database . The matchmakers claim Mr Greenfield wants women who are simply out of his league . Speaking about the matchmakers, Mr Greenfield said: 'You pay them up front and they don't provide a service. They tell you how wonderful you are, whatever you want to hear.' The matchmakers said Mr Greenfield needs to lower his expectations — and not rely only on his money to find love. 'In the outside world, he would not be able to get a date with that girl, because she was far more attractive,' blasted Long Island matchmaker Maureen Tara Nelson, who dropped Mr Greenfield as a client after one year. 'He was too picky! I gave him exactly what he wanted multiple times ... He would always come back with some minor, minor thing that the person wasn't perfect.' Serious Matchmaking's Janis Spindel said she's reluctant to take Mr Greenfield on as a client because she's worried that his dream girl isn't in her database. 'I don't want to take his money,' she said. 'The target audience of what he needs is a teacher from the boroughs or a secretary. Larry can't be with an alpha female who runs a hedge fund... He's a country bumpkin.' The former securities trader lives in rural Plainview, Long Island, and says he doesn't want to date a woman who is obsessed with her career. 'I'm battling successful alphas, driven women who are very comfortable in their lives, and I get left in the dust,' Mr Greenfield said. 'My job right now is meeting a girl.'","12 years and dates with 250 women without success .
