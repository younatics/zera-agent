"By . Lucy Osborne . A mother listened to an answerphone message recording the final moments of her daughter – who was sent home by a GP who ‘wouldn’t give her the time of day’. The walk-in-centre doctor carried out a ‘substandard’ examination on 20-year-old Evelyn Purchase, failing to notice that she had pneumonia, a coroner ruled. Barely 36 hours later, and as the arts student lay dying in bed, she tried to call her mother Tara but was forced to leave a message on her mobile. Tragic: Evelyn Purchase (left) was found dead just hours after a doctor failed to diagnose her pneumonia. Her mother Tara (right) says she found a voicemail message of her daughter's final moments after she died . Speaking yesterday, Miss Purchase . said: ‘Evelyn was still poorly the day after her trip to the doctor, . which was my birthday, and she decided to stay at home while I went out . with her sister, Dana. ‘We came home and I went to check on Evelyn, and found her  lifeless in her bedroom, clutching the phone. ‘My heart broke in two and I will never get over it. ‘I . later realised I had a voicemail message and when I listened to it, I . realised that Evelyn had tried to call me and I could hear her dying in . the message. ‘She has left a huge hole in all of our lives, and we will never get over her death.’ Coroner . Robin Balmain said a number of assumptions were made by the doctor . about the talented illustrator’s condition and that the assessment had . been ‘less than optimal’. Treatment: Evelyn Purchase was given antibiotics despite failing to respond to the medication on two previous occasions, and anti-depressants despite not being given a proper mental health examination . Less than optimal: Dr Mahmud Ahmed of Holly Hill clinic in Dudley (pictured) was criticised for level of care he provided. Evelyn Purchase died after her pneumonia was misdiagnosed as a chest infection . Recording a narrative verdict, he stopped short of saying Evelyn’s death could have been prevented. But he added: ‘This is a tragedy. This is the death of a young girl at the start of her adult life. ‘It . seems to me that what went  on during the course of that examination . was probably incomplete.’ Evelyn, a second year student at Hereford . College of Arts, visited a doctor at Holly Hall walk-in centre in . Dudley, West Midlands, on April 5 last year, with her mother, . complaining that she felt unwell. Mahmud Ahmed, who had previously treated Evelyn, diagnosed her with a chest infection and  prescribed antibiotics. He failed to realise he had already given her two courses of antibiotics which had failed to work. Believing . depression to be the cause of her loss of appetite, he also prescribed . anti-depressants – without carrying out a mental health examination. Dr . Ahmed told the inquest: ‘I did not check her oxygen levels as she was . not unduly short of breath. I thought that the infection was not so . serious for her to be admitted to hospital.’ Miss . Purchase, whose daughter Dana is 16, said: ‘I will never be able to . forgive myself for not being there for her when she needed me. I wish . someone had told us how ill she was. Talented: Evelyn Purchase was a second year illustration student at Hereford College of Arts. She hoped her work (pictured) would one day get her a job at video games manufacturer Sega . ‘We . begged the doctor to send her for a chest X-ray, but he wouldn’t. Evelyn was such a bright, clever young girl and she had her head screwed . on. ‘She was a shy . character who  concentrated on her studies, rarely partied, and she . never lost focus of her achieving her ambitions. ‘We . were incredibly close and she had never been kissed, didn’t have a . boyfriend because she knew where she wanted to go in life and knew that . she required focus to do so.’ The . maths and English teacher from Halesowen, who has divorced Evelyn’s . father David, plans to bring the case before the General Medical . Council. ‘I’m not saying . that she wasn’t treated but she was not treated appropriately for her . condition and, as a consequence, she died on my bed, in my bedroom, in . unbelievably bad circumstances,’ she said. ‘If she had been placed into  hospital she would have had the opportunity to fight for her life. ‘I’d . taken Evelyn to a few doctors’ appointments in the days before her . death and we went to the walk-in centre as her condition severely . worsened – but I just feel he didn’t have the time of day for us.’ Cause . of death at the inquest in Smethwick on Monday was given as extensive . bilateral pneumonia with pulmonary abscesses as a  contributing factor. Less than 36 hours after visiting Dr Mahmud Ahmed at the Holly Hall walk-in clinic in Dudley, West Midlands, Evelyn Purchase's mother found her dead at their home in nearby Cradley .","Evelyn Purchase, 20, was found dead just hours after the missed diagnosis .

"By . Lucy Osborne . A businessman died in a  scuba diving accident hours after his wife telephoned him to say she was pregnant. Lex Warner’s wife Deborah lost their unborn baby weeks later and is now bringing up their first child, two-year-old Vincent, alone. Mr Warner, 50, had fallen on board a chartered boat before a dive off the north coast of Scotland, suffering a severe injury to his liver. Accidental death: Lex Warner pictured on his 50th birthday with his wife Debbie and their son Vincent . Despite the fall diving instructors gave him the all clear to continue and he jumped into the water, diving to almost 290ft. But . he experienced serious difficulties and although Andrew Cuthbertson, . skipper of the Jean Elaine, hauled him to the surface, Mr Warner was . pronounced dead soon afterwards. Mrs . Warner, 42, who had been married  for 18 years, said: ‘I found out I . was ten weeks pregnant while Lex was on the boat, so called to tell him . and he was delighted. He told me a dive planned that morning had been . cancelled because of bad weather conditions. ‘He was still upbeat but was also excited about coming home. That was the last time I spoke to him.’ Mrs . Warner, from Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham, still works for the building . firm she ran with her husband who had gone diving with Scapa Flow . Charters. She claims she was . told after his death in August 2012 that he had drowned and his fall . wasn’t mentioned. ‘It was only when I went to Scotland for the . post-mortem that I found out he had sustained injuries not consistent . with diving. There have been two other deaths of divers using these . boats since 2007.’ Mrs . Warner, herself an experienced scuba diver, said she believes the . organisers of the dive did not carry out the appropriate checks after . her husband fell. Tragedy: Mr Warner died on August 14, 2012, and Debbie sadly lost their unborn child six weeks later . Keen diver: Lex Warner suffered serious internal injuries in a fall then drowned . She has . condemned the company for failing to stop her husband from diving and . for not carrying out thorough enough checks into his health. ‘I . am taking legal advice with a view to pursuing a claim through the . civil courts,’ Mrs Warner said. ‘I do not believe justice has been . served for Lex and I want to avoid this kind of avoidable tragedy . happening again. ‘Lex was very serious about his diving. He would never have jeopardised his safety.’ All-clear: Mr Warner suffered internal injuries but was given all-clear to dive by skipper Andrew Cuthbertson . At . a Birmingham inquest, in December, Captain Gavin Pritchard, an . inspector for the Marine Accident Investigation Branch, said Mr Warner’s . diving group had not been warned of the dangers of walking on deck in . full diving gear. Truth: Mrs Warner said she was pleased 'the truth has been told' at the inquest, but says she has still not come to terms with the tragedy . He added: . ‘There was no evidence of a formal risk assessment of a fully-dressed . diver moving from the seated position to the point of entry into the . water. It was our recommendation to conduct a thorough review of the . safety arrangements to minimise risk to divers as they prepare to enter . the water. ‘The severity of . the injuries was such that if he had not dived, his condition would have . still reached serious medical emergency level.’ Mr . Cuthbertson told the inquest he was satisfied with the safety . arrangements on his boats and had no plans to alter them. ‘I don’t think . we could have done anything differently,’ he said. ‘I can’t foresee . someone’s going to fall.’ Dr . Chris Ashton, who performed the post-mortem examination, gave the cause . of death as drowning combined with a traumatic hepatic (liver) injury. Coroner Louise Hunt recorded a verdict of accidental death. Scapa Flow Charters were yesterday unavailable to comment on Mrs Warner’s criticisms.","Debbie Warner broke the news to partner, Lex, while he was on diving trip .

"By . Sophie Borland . and Lucy Osborne . The campaigner who helped expose the Mid Staffordshire hospital scandal has been victimised by hate mail after being given a CBE. Julie Bailey set up the group Cure The NHS after her mother died from horrific care on the wards and pushed politicians to hold a public inquiry into the failings, which led to announcement that the hospital trust would be dissolved. This year she was forced to move out of her home in Stafford and close down her café after receiving death threats and abuse from local residents and hospital staff. Hurt: Julie Bailey out campaigning against poor care in Mid-Staffordshire NHS Trust. She has been victimised by hate mail, with some examples shown right, since being awarded a CBE in the New Year honours list . After she was named in the Queen’s New Year’s honours list yesterday, many of these individuals, including local councillors and nurses, took to the internet to vent their rage. One message, written by Andy Sutherland, describes her as a ‘lying b****. Writing on Facebook he added: ‘Lets get our fingers out and show the Tory’s [sic] what we think of them. Lying gits giving rewards to other lying gits.’ Nurse whistleblower Helene Donnelly – who helped expose appalling care in the trusts A&E department – was also given an OBE in the honours. But a message written by Mick Terry, who was born in Stafford, describes her and Miss Bailey as a ‘pair of s****’. And Christine Baron, an independent councillor on Stafford Borough Council, wrote: ‘Insult to: doctors and nurses everywhere who work diligently for their patients’. Miss Baron, who was on the council’s health scrutiny committee, which overlooked the failings at the trust, yesterday described the honour as ‘a complete insult’. The widowed mother-of-two said: ‘It is a disgrace that she had been honoured like this and shows that the system is a shambles. ‘We should all be embarrassed that this has happened, she has caused nothing but trouble with what she has done.’ NHS officials last month announced that Mid . Staffordshire trust would be dissolved and Stafford and Cannock . hospitals closed after concluding it didn't have enough cash to ensure . patients could be guaranteed safe care . Last month NHS officials announced that . Mid Staffordshire trust would be dissolved after concluding it did not . have enough money to ensure patients could be guaranteed safe care. A number of key departments at its two hospitals Stafford and Cannock will be taken over by neighbouring trusts and dozens of jobs are expected to go. Yesterday Miss Bailey, who also spoke out against Sir David Nicholson, the outgoing head of the NHS  dubbed ‘the man with no shame’ after he stayed in his job after being implicated in the Mid Staffs scandal, said she was ‘hurt’ by the messages but unsurprised. She added: ‘But I know there is so much support. But I know the NHS is a safer place and its going to get much safer.’","Julie Bailey targeted on Twitter and Facebook after being awarded a CBE .

"By . Wills Robinson . Followers of Haiti's most celebrated patron saint have made their annual pilgrimage to a remote waterfall in a bid to cleanse themselves of their bad luck and sins. Voodoo worshippers travelled to Saut d'Eau, 42 miles north of the capital Port-au-Prince, to wash in the water which is believed to have purifying powers. As part of the cleansing ritual, they delivered a list of wishes to improve to their lives and used leaves to wash away negative omens. Lionel Saint-Jean, who attended the gathering, said that after losing his house in Haiti's catastrophic 2010 quake, he asked the saint for a new one and he got one. 'So I came this year to thank her for that,' he said. Haitians have travelled to the same spot for hundreds of years to bathe because the virgin saint is believed to have appeared on a palm tree there in 1847. Voodoo, or Vodou as many practitioners prefer, evolved from West African beliefs and adopted elements of Roman Catholicism. To a higher power: A woman holds up an empty bowl to the waterfall before praying at the Saut d'Eau waterfall in Haiti. As part of the ritual, they also petition the saint, Our Lady Mount Carmel, by shouting out a wish list at the base of the cascading water . Euphoria: A woman holds out her hand and sings  while a number of other Haitian worshippers bathe in the mystical water behind . Immersed: A voodoo pilgrim stands in the middle of the waterfall which is believed to have purifying powers . Bathing: A Voodoo pilgrim scrubs himself with tree leaves which he believes will give him good luck, as he readies to cleanse himself with the other followers .

"By . Lucy Osborne . and Wills Robinson . A Council is spending £10,000 on ‘motivational’ text messages to overweight people, telling them to ‘walk to the shops’ or ‘eat slightly smaller portions’. Stoke-on-Trent City Council’s bizarre scheme sends daily texts to obese people with a short message of ‘advice and support’. They include statements such as: ‘Why not walk to the shops more often’, and ‘Keep a check on snacks and drinks’. But the idea has been condemned by critics as ‘a gimmick’ that ‘states the obvious’. Tackling the problem: The inspirational messages will be sent out every day to 500 participants during the 10-week scheme (file picture) Fat map: Bassetlaw in Nottinghamshire has the highest number of hospitalisations for weight-related problems . The region has been crippled with an obesity epidemic, with the local NHS forking out more than £50 million-a-year to battle the problem. Critics of the scheme today slammed the initiative as 'ridiculous' Robert Oxley, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance . said: ‘Council chiefs shouldn’t play nanny with taxpayers’ money. It’s . difficult to see how these texts are anything other than a ridiculous . waste of cash. ’ But City Councillor Adrian Knapper said: 'We are recruiting 500 residents to take part in the 10-week feasibility study which will see participants receive daily advice and support through their mobile phones. 'Obesity has reached epidemic levels across Stoke-on-Trent, where an estimated 28 per cent of adults are obese. 'The new text message service will offer support to adults who want to achieve and maintain a healthy weight.' Motivation: Examples of the inspirational messages people on the scheme will receive when it begins at the end of this month . GP practice manager Claire Woodfint, 32, who once tipped the scales at 23 stone before losing almost half of her bodyweight, is backing the idea. Claire commented: 'Text messages would have helped me. 'I lost weight through diet rather than exercise and if I had got something to motivate me it would have helped. 'It stops you from losing sight of what you are trying to achieve.' Adrian Knapper, Cabinet Member for . Health, Well Being and Culture, said the initiative was using tried and . tested techniques from both the public and private sectors. He said: 'We have over 100,000 people in our region who are overweight or obese. 'Our . Public Health Team are using the texting technique as just one part of a . comprehensive set of public health activities to help and support . people in changing their lifestyles, through taking more exercise and . improving their diets.

"By . James Rush . and Lucy Osborne . Lifelong vegetarian Roshni Barot (pictured) was served a chicken pitta at Nando's after she ordered a grilled halloumi cheese pitta . Although she is a strict vegetarian, Roshni Barot had no qualms about going to Nando’s for a meal. The 28-year-old was on a shopping trip with a friend when they popped into a branch of the restaurant chain, which specialises in flame-grilled chicken. Miss Barot, who shuns meat for religious reasons, had eaten there before and had always enjoyed the vegetarian options. She chose a grilled halloumi pitta and, when her meal arrived, she covered it in peri-peri sauce, added salad, and tucked in. She had almost finished the meal before she noticed the halloumi looked strange and had an unusual taste. To her horror, she discovered she had been eating chicken rather than cheese. It had been served to her by mistake after staff misread her order. Miss Barot, who has never eaten meat, said she wept into her plate. ‘I was in shock and started crying in the restaurant. I cried all night and couldn’t sleep,’ she said. ‘I can feel it sitting there in my stomach. I feel like it’s not my body any more.’ She was still distressed the following day and was allowed to go home early from her job as placements officer at the University of Birmingham. The manager at the Nando’s in the Bull Ring, Birmingham, apologised and offered her vouchers for another meal, which she refused. Miss Barot grew up in a Hindu household in Tividale, near Dudley, West Midlands, where none of the family eats meat. Ms Barot was served the meal at Nando's in the Bullring, Birmingham, (pictured) after she had ordered a grilled halloumi cheese pitta . Ms Barot said she had never eaten meat before she was served a chicken pitta at the restaurant (file picture of a Nando's chicken fillet pitta) Ms Barot was served a chicken pitta despite ordering the grilled halloumi cheese pitta (file picture) Being vegetarian is a large part of . her identity and she was so distraught that she tried unsuccessfully to . make herself sick when she got home from Nando’s. She said she felt that something she had worked hard to maintain had been thrown away without her  consent or control. Roshni Barot . ‘I never would have thought that I would need to double-check my food. I trusted them and they have let me down,’ she said. ‘They can never say or do anything to make this up to me. Nothing . can compensate me for those 28 years. They took away my choice about . what to put in my body and now I can’t ever say that I have never eaten . meat. I was a Nando’s fan but I will never go there again.’ Nando’s . said yesterday: ‘We deeply regret that a customer was mistakenly served . a chicken pitta instead of the halloumi pitta ordered. 'Nando’s . has the utmost respect for all our customers’ eating choices and this . was an honest – and extremely rare – mistake which the restaurant are . extremely sorry about. ‘We . are currently in contact with the customer and have offered our sincere . apologies and are investigating how this has happened to ensure it . doesn’t happen again.’","Roshni Barot ordered grilled halloumi cheese pitta at Nando's restaurant .

"By . Lucy Osborne . John Chen Lui Lu infected patients with deadly bacteria during heart surgery between December 2008 and July 2010, because he 'constantly changed his gloves mid-operation' A heart surgeon who infected at least 11 patients with a bug that killed five of them is seeking to keep his past a secret when he returns to the operating theatre. John Chen Lui Lu has been banned from performing operations since the deaths in 2009 and 2010 were triggered when he passed on the bacteria staphylococcus epidermidis to patients receiving artificial heart valves. The bacteria lives on the skin of most people but can be deadly if it enters the bloodstream of those with surgical implants or weak immune systems, and was allegedly passed on due to Mr Lu’s habit of changing gloves mid-operation. Although the surgeon was allowed to continue his work as a consultant in the cardiac department at Nottingham’s City Hospital, he is being allowed to return to the operating theatre only if he is open about his background with future patients. But in what has been described as an unprecedented case, the surgeon is taking Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust to the High Court after he refused to accept its order. Mr Lu does not believe it is necessary to disclose the deaths, and the hearing next month will centre on the ‘level of information’ patients should receive about his background before he operates on them. His solicitors are expected to argue that telling patients about his past will be a restriction of trade, while the Trust will say that patient safety would be compromised. As well as the five patients who died, Mr Lu infected six others who survived. Alan Daniels (left) and Michael Smithers (right) both died after being infected with staphylococcus epidermidis bacteria while Mr Lu operated . Mr Lu was temporarily suspended before returning to work in 2013. He's not allowed to operate but is fighting to be allowed to return to theatre. Albert Rigley (left) and Dennis Mills (right) died after Mr Lu operated on them . Lawyers for the families of the five . men who died told an inquest in 2010 that Mr Lu’s habit of changing . gloves during surgery had caused the bacteria to be passed on. The . hearing was told that of 28 patients who had valves inserted by the . surgeon at City Hospital’s Trent Cardiac Centre in 2009 and 2010, 11 . fell ill. On Thursday, the . trust sent a  letter to all patients and relatives affected by the . outbreak, informing them of the legal wrangle. Mr Lu is locked in a legal battle with Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust which says he can only return to theatre if he tells his patients about his history before he operates. Image shows Nottingham City Hospital . In . it, bosses said they were ‘committed’ to bringing Mr Lu back to . surgery, but only if patients receive ‘appropriate information’ about . his history. Yesterday, Denise Edwards, whose 82 year-old father Dennis . Mills was one of those who died, told of her shock when she read the . letter about the possibility of Mr Lu returning to surgery. ‘I . lived through the trauma and distress of seeing my father, who was a . fit and active man before having his surgery, slowly deteriorating and . eventually dying as a result of the infection.’ A . hospital spokesman said: ‘We remain committed to Mr Lu’s return ... but . we are determined that patients will receive appropriate information as . they consider having surgery at our hospital.’ Mr Lu’s solicitors have not commented. David Tyson, 68, contracted the infection after undergoing a heart valve replacement at Nottingham City Hospital in June 2009.

"By . Richard Shears . Richard William Fruin was found guilty of committing indecent acts against the three brothers aged eight, 10 and 11 . A notorious British paedophile with a history of child abuse in the UK and South East Asia has been sent to prison for two years in Cambodia for sexually assaulting three young boys. Richard William Fruin, 36, from Gloucestershire was found guilty by Judge Kim Rathnarin of committing indecent acts against the three brothers aged eight, 10 and 11. Along with his prison sentence, he was fined £600 and ordered to pay £1,500 to the victims' family. Fruin was working as an English . teacher at the Universal English School in the Cambodian capital, Phnom . Penh when he was arrested with one of the boys at a guesthouse in the . city. Anti-human-trafficking . police burst into the Boeung Meas guest house where they found Fruin in . bed with the eight year old - but he claimed the child was there as a . young friend and that he had not molested him. Fruin . will now join in prison another Briton, 67-year-old David Fletcher, . from Norwich, who has been convicted of raping a number of children who . were living in a slum. Fruin was arrested in the UK in 2005 and charged with 15 counts of producing indecent . images of children, but skipped bail and fled the country. According . to Action Pour Les Enfants, an anti-paedophile organisation, while on . the run Fruin travelled to Africa and then to South East Asia before . returning to Britain in 2012.

Richard William Fruin had been staying at the Boeung Meas guesthouse in the capital of Cambodia . Fruin has been charged with molesting the eight-year-old after he was found sleeping with the youngster in this guest house in Phnom Penh . On his return he was re-arrested and sentenced to a year in prison, on completion of which he flew to Cambodia and immediately started work as a teacher. Cambodia was once the haunt of child molester Gary Glitter . Mr . Koem Vando, deputy director at the anti-paedophile . organisation, said: 'Fruin has a history of abuse and the police have . found many more Cambodian victims.'The . mother of the boy found with Fruin claimed after the Briton's arrest . that all three of her sons told police they had been sexually abused by . him. According to the . mother, Fruin had been visiting her roadside shop in Phnom Penh for . about a month and had previously taken her two older boys to the guest . house where he was staying. She said she had no idea that he had evil intent with her sons. Miss . Pen Chantha, the guesthouse owner, said she was shocked when police . raided the room and arrested Fruin while he was in bed with the boy.

"By . Wills Robinson . Tulisa Contostavlos has vowed to 'clear her name' after she was found guilty of attacking a celebrity blogger who published her private sex tape. It was her second court appearance in what she described as a 'rollercoaster week' after she was cleared of dealing drugs on Monday. Stood outside court yesterday, the N-Dubz star protested her innocence, saying she had not attacked Savvas ‘Vas’ Morgan at V Festival in Essex last year. Scroll down for video . Convicted: Tulisa Contostavlos, pictured outside Stratford Magistrates' Court in east London today, was fined £200 for hitting a celebrity blogger at V Festival . Guilty: The N-Dubz star, pictured arriving at Stratford Magistrates' Court in east London today, hit Savvas Morgan during an altercation at the V Festival in Essex . Costostavlos looked stern when she arrived at the court, left, but looked downcast after the verdict . The 26-year-old had arrived at Stratford Magistrates’ Court yesterday smiling and full of confidence. She also sported bee-stung lips which had fans speculating whether she had had surgery. 'This has been a rollercoaster week for me. I never wanted any of this. 'I did not assault Vas J Morgan and I am outraged at this decision. I will be appealing it. 'There are a number of high-profile witnesses who were there and know what happened. I urge them to come forward and tell the truth at the appeal. 'I am determined to clear my name as I have already done once this week. I repeat - I did not assault Vas J Morgan. I am innocent.' But she shook her head in disbelief after being found guilty of assault and was later heard saying: ‘This is bull****.’ Speaking . outside the courthouse she said it had been a ‘rollercoaster week’ and . she was determined to prove her innocence once again. She said: ‘I did not assault Vas J Morgan and I am outraged at this decision – I will be appealing it. There . are a number of high-profile witnesses who were there and know what . happened. I urge them to come forward and tell the truth.’ The criminal record means the singer is unlikely to be welcomed back to mainstream TV. The attack was said to have taken place in the closing stages of the V Festival in Chelmsford, Essex, last August. Her . barrister, Jeremy Dein QC, said she was angry over the sex tape, which . was published on Mr Morgan’s website in 2012, of her performing a sex . act on her then boyfriend. It was removed only after a High Court injunction was granted. Mr . Dein added: ‘Mr Morgan played a significant part in humiliating and . debasing Miss Contostavlos’s reputation, clearly for financial gain.’ Contostavlos . and her entourage were walking towards the festival’s VIP camping area . when they clashed with Mr Morgan shortly after midnight. The blogger was . said to have been hit in the face by . Arrival: Her assistant, Gareth Varey, (right) was cleared of using threatening behaviour during the incident last August . Court appearance: She was found guilty of assault just four days after she was cleared of supplying cocaine . Contostavlos as she went at him with both arms swinging. Mr Morgan suffered a ‘swollen eye’ and reported the attack to police. District . Judge Angus Hamilton said the singer was ‘aggressive and . confrontational’. He said he was ‘quite sure’ she did strike Mr Morgan. Tulisa was ordered by the court to pay a total of £3,020. Her assistant, Gareth Varey, 28, was cleared of using threatening behaviour. Contostavlos was sharply dressed for court in a single breasted suit, a white blouse, and tan coloured heels . In a statement read outside court, Contostavlos said she was 'determined to clear my name' Earlier this week, Tulisa celebrated after her trial on drugs charges collapsed at Southwark Crown . Court. The judge said there were ‘strong grounds’ to believe undercover . reporter Mazher Mahmood – known as the Fake Sheikh – had lied in the . witness box. Last . night, Mr Morgan – who has joined ITV2 series The Only Way Is Essex – . said: ‘I’m pleased we can finally put an end to this and move on.’ Tulisa at Southwark Crown Court on Monday . The N-Dubz singer was sensationally cleared of arranging a drugs deal on Monday in a case she claims was a 'horrific and disgusting entrapment'. The 26 year old had been accused of setting up an £800 cocaine deal, asking her friend Michael Coombs to take drugs to undercover reporter Mazher Mahmood. He told her he was a ‘big shot’ movie executive offering her a £3million role in a blockbuster starring opposite Leonardo DiCaprio. But the case collapsed when the reporter, also known as the 'Fake Sheikh', was found to have lied in court. When she left Southwark Crown Court, she condemned Mazher Mahmood, the journalist who is known as the Fake Sheikh, for ruining her life for a year and targeting her. 'This whole case was a horrific and disgusting entrapment by Mazher Mahmood and the Sun on Sunday newspaper. 'Mahmood has now been exposed by my lawyers openly lying to the judge and jury. These lies were told to stop crucial evidence going before the jury. This evidence shows that I told Mahmood's long-standing driver that I disapproved of drugs, which is the truth. 'Thankfully the lies have been uncovered and justice has been done.' 'It is clear that the driver was pressured to change his statement to strengthen Mahmood's evidence and to damage mine.' Mahmood has targeted a raft of celebrities, sportsmen and royals in tabloid stings, is now set to be investigated by the police and has been suspended by the Sun on Sunday newspaper. He could face jail for perjury and perverting the course of justice after it emerged that he ‘deliberately lied’ in court about manipulating a key witness by persuading him to retract a police statement suggesting Miss Contostavlos disapproved of drugs. TV appearances: Savvas Morgan (right) has become a regular cast member in TOWIE since the incident, starring alongside the likes of James Lock (left) Her assistant, Gareth Varey, was cleared of using threatening behaviour during the incident last August. Earlier this week, a drugs trial against Contostavlos collapsed at Southwark Crown Court after the judge said there were 'strong grounds' to believe that undercover reporter Mazher Mahmood - known as the Fake Sheikh - had lied in the witness box. Earlier in the trial, the singer told the court that Mr Morgan conducted a 'vendetta' against her since an incident in which she asked security to remove him from a VIP area at the Whisky Mist nightclub in London’s Mayfair. She also claimed she believed Mr Morgan was involved in the release of a sex tape of her online. But added that she had no grudge against him, saying: 'He was one of many.' Since the incident, Mr Morgan has become a regular cast member on ITV's TOWIE. At the end of the hearing, he said: ‘I’m pleased we can finally put an end to this and move on. It’s been a difficult time for everyone involved and i’d just like to put it behind me. I’ve had my character questioned and now feel vindicated by the verdict.'

"By . Wills Robinson . A married prison officer has been jailed for having sex with a blonde inmate in her cell. Amritpal Ahluwalia was given a 15-prison sentence for sleeping with 22-year-old Colette O'Flaherty twice at HMP Bronzfield, Surrey. Even though the 31-year-old guard admitted the affair, Guildford Crown Court was told his wife has forgiven him and they are 'back together'. Improper relationship: Amritpal Ahluwalia, 31, (left) had two secret trysts with inmate Colette O'Flaherty, 22 (right). She was serving a six-year sentence for firearms offences . A judge heard that Ahluwalia and O'Flaherty began flirting in 2012 while she was serving a six-year sentence for firearms offences. She worked in the hairdressing salon within the prison, which holds 600 inmates, and Ahluwalia first arranged to meet her alone there for sex under the pretence she had to collect some styling text books. Prosecutor Brian Stork said: 'Miss O'Flaherty was nervous - she knew what she was doing was wrong but the defendant was reassuring, telling her it would be all right. 'Once in the salon, she kissed the defendant. He undressed her and they had full sexual intercourse.' Mr Stork said Ahluwalia was 'very flattering' as he returned her to her wing and said 'how brilliant she had been.' On August 5, 2012, Ahluwalia appeared at the door of O'Flaherty's cell out of hours, where he went inside the room and had sex with her again. This time, the prison's CCTV cameras captured the prison officer entering her cell and leaving 'minutes later'. Mr Stork added: 'At the time, he had no permission or reason to go there. We see him go into the cell. Once inside, he told her to lie on the bed. He kissed her, touched her and told her he loved her.' Their relationship was uncovered when O'Flaherty confided in the prison's gym instructor, who immediately reported Ahluwalia to the governor. That is when the CCTV footage was reviewed and evidence of their tryst was exposed. Ahluwalia, of  Cranford, Middlesex, denied the allegations but eventually pleaded guilty on the first day of his trial. Mr Stork said the defendant had worked at privately-run Bronzefield since 2009 and was fully aware of the rules. Secret arrangement: The pair first met in the salon of HMP Bronzefield, Surrey, where O'Flaherty worked as a hairdresser. They then had sex in her cell where CCTV captured the guard leaving 'minutes later' He added: 'It was wholly wrong, it is a significant and wilful breach of trust and it is entirely against the law for a prison officer to engage in sexual intercourse with an inmate, with or without her consent.' Ahluwalia, whose wife initially left him after the affair came to light, held his head in his hands as he sat in the dock wearing a grey suit. His parents and other prominent members of his Sikh community sat silently in the public gallery during the hearing. Defence barrister Jemima Ivens said her client and his family 'felt great shame' over his actions, that he realised what he had done was wrong and asked for a suspended prison sentence. However, Judge Christopher Critchlow jailed him for 15 months, and said: 'This was sexual behaviour that was consensual but you should not have engaged in it and you knew that. 'You were married and attracted to her. You let yourself get carried away and, as a result, this matter came to light. You denied it and continued to deny it right up until the day of your trial.' The court heard Ahluwalia committed two further crimes while on bail. Both related to breaches of a non-molestation order not to contact his wife, who had left him over his affair. However, the judge heard the couple had since patched things up and were now back together. Judge Critchlow said: 'This relationship should never have led to sexual intercourse. It can have a significant emotional effect on a female prisoner. 'Because of the nature of a prison officer's responsibilities - particularly when a male prison officer is employed in a female prison - this sort of behaviour must result in an immediate period of imprisonment.' Ahluwalia had been due to face other similar charges relating to misconduct with Miss O'Flaherty and a second inmate, Charlene Nelson, but prosecutors abandoned them after his guilty plea. The judge told him he would serve half of his sentence before being considered for release on licence.","Amritpal Ahluwalia, 31, was jailed for 15 months after bedding the  inmate .

"By . Wills Robinson . A parish council chief who buried a haul of deadly weapons in his garden has died awaiting trial in prison, leaving the reason he kept the guns a complete mystery. Villagers were left in shock when Jim Arnold, 49, was arrested after massive police operation uncovered an arsenal which included Uzis and AK47s behind his house in Wyverstone near Stowmarket, Suffolk. He passed away while on remand in high-security Belmarsh Prison and was due at Ipswich Crown Court tomorrow to face a string of firearms offences. It means no one will ever know why he hid the guns or why he collected them in the first place. Search: Police officers discovered the haul of illegal weapons behind Jim Arnold's home in Wyverstone near Stowmarket, Suffolk. He died in prison while awaiting trial for firearms offences . Eddie Gale, 74, who lives about 500 yards from Mr Arnold's home, said it was a complete surprise to villagers. He told the BBC: 'I knew Jim was into shooting, but it was normally clay pigeons rather than Uzis.' 'He used to knock on the door and ask if it was all right for him to have a group at his place shooting.' Following his arrest in April, he appeared before magistrates in Bury St Edmunds via a video link from the prison in Thamesmead, London, looking ill and fragile. He originally faced four firearms offences but it is understood that police were preparing to add to the charge list before Mr Arnold appeared at Ipswich Crown Court tomorrow. The former chairman of the parish council had been diagnosed with terminal cancer and told friends in the village last year that he only had months to live. Suffolk police revealed yesterday that he died in jail on July 14th and that the Crown Prosecution Service has ended the case against him. Weapons: The stash included a number of high-powered assault rifles such as AK47s . Powerful: During a month-long search, police also found a number of Uzis hidden in the collection . Stash: The illegal arsenal was buried in the garden behind Mr Arnold's home (pictured) Current vice-chairman of the parish council Eddie Gale said yesterday: 'It is a very sad end - Jim was well-liked and respected in thevillage for all the hard work he put into the community. 'He was on several committees and an invaluable part of the village -everyone was stunned when the police raided his home and the place was surrounded and sealed off for weeks as they searched his garden. 'It was just unbelievable to think that he was in some way involved with guns or crime - no-one had any idea that firearms might even have been a hobby of his. 'His death was not unexpected - he told me he had cancer and only a few months to live last March. Everyone is very sad but in a way it is a kind of release for him . 'His widow wants to have Jim buried in the local church and I am sure there will be a really good turnout.'

"By . Karen Kay . According to the Health & Social Care Information Centre, 83 per cent of Britons are showing signs of gum disease . It doesn’t take much to keep your teeth and gums in great shape, yet according to the Health & Social Care Information Centre, 83 per cent of Britons are showing signs of gum disease. So what can you do to ensure your smile stays in style? Most of us are aware of the confidence-boosting benefits of a fabulous foundation, mascara or blush, and we’re clearly happy to invest both hard-earned cash and precious time on them. It’s a rare woman who can make her way through a department store beauty floor without being tempted by the latest cosmetic colours. However, the amount of money we spend on replenishing our make-up bags may surprise you - recent figures estimate that we’ll each spend an average of £131.20  a year on make-up. And we spend, on average, around 20 minutes a day applying cosmetics, which equates to over 120 hours every year. Conduct a quick straw poll around you and you’ll probably find most of us don’t dedicate nearly as much time and effort to our oral health. INVEST IN YOUR SMILE . So, are you guilty of getting your priorities wrong and leaving the true beauty of your smile at the bottom of the pile? After all, no amount of on-trend lip colour can mask the signs of poor oral health. In fact, not only can symptoms such as red, swollen gums detract from a radiant smile, but if left untreated, gum disease could have devastating consequences such as tooth loss. With more than four in five people in the UK showing signs of gum disease, it’s time we refocused some of our efforts to improve our oral hygiene. And of course, it’s not just women who are guilty of ignoring the telltale symptoms. According . to a new survey by MailOnline, only 19 per cent of us would visit the . dentist if we noticed changes in our gums, compared to 46 per cent who . would visit when they have trouble with their teeth. And, astonishingly, almost half of all those questioned have never spoken with their dentist about gum health. More than four in five people in the UK show signs of gum disease . Gum disease is the swelling, soreness or infection – in varying degrees - of the tissue supporting the teeth. You may have heard of gingivitis, the name given to the early stage of gum disease, caused by an accumulation of plaque, which contains bacteria that needs to be removed in order to maintain healthy gums. READ THE SIGNALS . The problem is that many of us don’t recognise the early signs of gum disease: one of the warning signals that you may have gingivitis is redness of the gums around the tooth, and bleeding when you brush your teeth. MailOnline found that 41 per cent of readers surveyed had experienced bleeding while brushing or flossing, yet one in three said they believed bleeding gums are the result of brushing too vigorously. But, if ignored and left untreated, gingivitis can lead to the more advanced type of gum disease, periodontitis, which can result in the bone in your jaw decaying, and potential tooth loss. According to a new survey by MailOnline, only 19 per cent of us would visit the dentist if we noticed changes in our gums, compared to 46 per cent who would visit when they have trouble with their teeth . NHS figures suggest that between 10 and 15 per cent of adults in the UK suffer from severe periodontitis, with many more being affected by mild to moderate levels. The good news is that most gum disease is preventable and mild cases can easily be treated with an overhaul of your simple daily oral routine. Don’t wait until you notice bleeding or soreness when you clean, or experience bad breath (halitosis) or a metallic taste in your mouth. As with all health issues, prevention is far better than cure, so take those vital steps now and you could avoid problems later. OVERHAUL YOUR ORAL CARE . It's important to clean properly between your teeth, yet according to a MailOnline survey, only two in five of us floss on a daily basis . The first thing you need to consider is how you clean your teeth. It may seem obvious, but many of us have neglected to learn efficient and effective brushing methods, and have simply continued with our childhood technique, often slipping into sloppy habits. As with most areas of our lives, tooth care technology has vastly improved over recent years. Toothpaste formulas have changed dramatically to include multi-tasking active treatments that not only clean but care for your teeth on a daily basis. Even if your water supply contains fluoride, it’s worth using toothpaste which also contains this mineral, which helps protect against tooth decay. Ask your dentist or hygienist for their recommendation, as they will be able to offer expert advice on the best products to deliver optimum benefits for you. It’s important to make regular visits to a dental hygienist, as they can help remove stubborn tartar – hardened plaque – with a regular ‘scale and polish’, and monitor your oral wellbeing. If you’re not sure how frequently you should see a hygienist, your dentist will make a recommendation based upon your general oral health. BRUSH UP ON YOUR BRUSHING TECHNIQUE . While you are talking with your hygienist, tap into their expertise and ask for some guidance on brushing techniques. Many people are embarrassed to do this, as they feel it is an admission that they have potentially been doing it wrong, but it’s better correct poor habits now than continue and do further damage. If you’re still using a manual brush, you may find that switching to an electric brush helps clean more thoroughly, and helps to maintain the correct, even pressure – some more expensive brushes even alert you if you’re pressing too hard, to avoid pushing back the gumline and exposing the sensitive tooth root. Don’t be tempted to move the brush . around your mouth constantly, though. Let the rotating brush head do all . the work for you, and simply move from one tooth to another after a few . seconds. It should . take approximately two minutes to clean all your teeth – if it helps, . set a timer on your smartphone, and spend 30 seconds on each quarter of . your mouth, morning and night. Using a daily mouthwash can help control the build-up of plaque and protect against bacteria . Again, your hygienist will be able to advise on which type of brush head is best suited to your needs, and areas you really need to focus on. For example, some patients find one side of their mouth is healthier than the other, as they’ve cleaned more enthusiastically if they are left or right-handed. RINSE YOUR MOUTH OUT & GET FLOSSING . Use a daily mouthwash to help control the build-up of plaque and protect against bacteria. If you think you’re already showing signs of gum disease, talk to your dentist or hygienist, who may suggest you use a product containing chlorhexidine, an active ingredient that’s clinically proven to help treat gum disease. Products containing chlorhexidine are available over the counter, and can be an important weapon in the fight against gum disease. It’s also important to clean properly between your teeth, yet according to the MailOnline survey, only two in five of us floss on a daily basis. So, if you’re not doing it every day already, use floss, tape or small interdental brushes (they come in different sizes, so seek advice on which you need, which will depend on how tightly packed together your teeth are) to remove all remaining food debris and plaque from those crevices between your teeth.","83% of Britons show signs of gum disease, but only 19% say they would visit their dentist if they noticed a change in their gums .

"By . Peter Lloyd . Hugh Grant has urged Britain to reintroduce National Service, saying:  ‘It goes with our personality. It suits us.’ Although the actor has never served in the  Forces, he paid tribute  to Britain’s military  tradition, which made heroes of his forefathers. Speaking at last week’s launch of singer and photographer Bryan Adams’s book Wounded: The Legacy Of War, Grant, 54, said: ‘My father and grandfather both served and it shaped them. Ideal: The actor said Britain is an ideal nation for military service because 'we get on with things' ‘National Service can definitely benefit society. Britain is an ideal nation  for military service because we get on with things.’ Calling for a return to National Service is usually the preserve of Tory politicians, but Grant added: ‘I have left views, but I also have right views.’ The actor’s grandfather Major James Murray Grant served with the Seaforth Highlanders and  was awarded a Distinguished Service Order  for bravery and leadership during the Second World War. He had defied an order to surrender to overwhelming German troops when stranded at St Valery-en-Caux, France, after the 1940 Dunkirk evacuation. Grant’s father, also called James, trained at Sandhurst and spent eight years in the Army. Hero: Major James Grant, Hugh's grandfather, won the Distinguished Service Order for bravery and leadership during the Second World War . But the millionaire actor admitted that ‘probably the closest I’ll get’ to military service is playing a  naval intelligence commander in Guy Ritchie’s forthcoming film The Man From U.N.C.L.E. Tory MP Philip Hollobone, who has drawn up a Private Member’s Bill calling for Britain to reintroduce National Service, said: ‘Hugh is clearly a very sensible chap. Now he has spoken out I hope we can eventually secure a debate in Parliament.’ However, an online campaign to prevent the return of National Service has 35,000 supporters.","The 54-year-old said it would be ideal because 'we get on with things'

"By . Peter Lloyd . Nadine O'Connor, campaign manager for Fathers4Justice . When Kate Winslet became the subject of a Fathers4Justice campaign last month, the world watched as a glamorous Hollywood icon became embroiled in the gritty debate on fathers' rights. No place for an Oscar-winning screen star, the 38-year-old was unimpressed when the equal parenting group used her home life as the launch of their Crummy Mummy ad campaign. The initiative, which attempts to stop women denying fathers access to their families, coincided with the birth of Winslet's latest child - Bear - and followed comments she'd made to fashion bible Vogue, which said: 'None of this 50/50 time with the mums and dads – my children live with me; that is it.' The advert, which ran in the Daily Express, criticised the Titanic star for her comments on shared parenting and re-ignited the debate on our country's creaking custody courts. Unsurprisingly, Kate - who also has a 13-year-old daughter, Mia, from her first marriage to director Jim Threapleton and a nine-year-old son, Joe, from her second marriage to Sam Mendes - objected to becoming a poster girl for sexist mothers, launching a legal threat against F4J along the way with high-power law firm Schillings. But, rather than finding angry men in Batman costumes at the helm, the kingpin was - perhaps surprisingly - a woman. Nadine O'Connor was the brains, the braun and the balls behind the controversial ad, which directly questioned a woman's automatic, unquestioned power in family law. So the first question when we meet in London's Waterloo is perhaps an obvious one: why on earth would she want to swap sisterhood for a superhero suit? After all, no matter how powerful women have become in recent years, the partnership remains an unlikely one. The answer, it seems, is simple. From 2002 to 2012, Nadine - a devoted mother-of-two - had her own devastating insight into what fathers experience on a regular basis. And it moved her. For ten years she endured 25 judges, 70 hearings, 54 criminal allegations, 45 court orders and over £120,000 in legal bills when a dispute with her ex-husband over residency of their daughter turned into a living nightmare. Despite offering him shared residency and unlimited contact, the dispute continued for over a decade because her ex wanted sole custody at the exclusion of Nadine. During that time she lost her home, her job, her health and nearly her mind as she was driven to the edge of a breakdown. But, rather than becoming angry with men, she identified with them - and got angry with the system. Nadine O'Connor, left, was the brains behind the controversial Fathers4Justice campaign which used Kate Winslet as their poster girl for shared parenting . 'In 2005, three years into my own battle, a girlfriend told me about Fathers4Justice. She said my story sounded like that of the men she'd read about in the papers, so I went to a meeting with my Dad,' she says. 'I had second thoughts and very nearly didn't go because I was worried they'd be hostile towards women, but I couldn't have been more wrong. In fact, they saved me.' Several years of activism followed - including interrupting a live BBC broadcast of the National Lottery - but fast-forward to the present day and Nadine, who is fashionable and funny as well as fantastically formidable, is now the organisation's campaign manager: uniting men who, ironically, have been disenfranchised by women. Kate Winslet, pregnant with her third baby, Bear, in October, has three children by three different men . Specifically, between 2010-12, she led negotiations with both the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats on family law reform. But how did such an unlikely relationship blossom? 'I came to Father4Justice for help because there were no women’s groups who could support me in the same way,' she adds, matter-of-factly. 'Had they been hostile or campaigning to take power away from women then I wouldn't have got involved. But F4J have never done that. They simply ask that fathers be given the same power as women.' This message, she says, formed an integral part of her recent work with 'the Kate campaign' because, socially and legally, it remains off-limits. Even in the upper echelons of LA. But Nadine's criticisms aren't just reserved for Winslet. Kim Basinger, Katie Holmes and Halle Berry are all next in line for a new set of adverts which are expected to run in national newspapers, next month. Meanwhile, rumours are abound that Geri Halliwell is also on their hit list while another Winslet ad, featuring comments by her ex Jim Threapleton - who previously spoke out in defence of F4J - is currently in production and threatens to continue the furore. 'Kate still needs to retract her comments and make a statement supporting 50/50 shared parenting. That's all we ever wanted,' Nadine says, passionately. 'And we'll continue until she does'. Clearly, as her attitude to Hollywood's leading ladies may indicate, Nadine has no concerns about impressing her fellow females simply because they share the same XX chromosomes. 'The only reactions from women that I need to validate what I do are those of my daughter, my mother and my closest female friends who all completely understand the importance of the campaign,' she says. Part of that, she confesses, includes questioning and rejecting modern feminism. 'Thatcher said feminism was trade unionism for women and I agree with that. Instead, I believe in equality for both sexes. Neither gender should pursue equality at the expense of the other. 'Over the last 20 years the original feminist movement has been hijacked by radical feminism and this has profoundly damaged women's campaign for equality, of which there are still areas that needs addressing. Any kind of ‘ism’ is generally bad news and feminism has become a form of extremism, especially with the anti-father ideology they support. 'If people think that's controversial perhaps they should ask themselves why.' Kate Winslet and her third husband Ned Rocknroll at an event in Hong Kong in December 2012 . That said, this woman on a mission bristles at the suggestion that what she is doing is actually harming women's liberation. She claims the opposite is true. 'I spend much of my working day supporting women, mothers, grandmothers and sisters to help them see their children, grandchildren and nephews and nieces,' she asserts.  'Unlike the law, I don’t discriminate on the basis of gender.' This aside, she admits that being a woman in her role certainly has some advantages. 'It should be irrelevant that I am a woman doing this job, but I would be wrong pretending it does not have an effect on how some people view the campaign. 'One third of F4J’s registered supporters are women and we have only ever had women run the Fathers4Justice campaign office. The most important effect of having a woman running F4J is that it helps people understand family breakdown and contact denial can happen to anyone, mother or father.' Compellingly, the facts speak for themselves. According to The Office of National Statistics, one in three youngsters now have no access to their father - which equates to almost four million UK children nationwide. This isn't because men are feckless fathers - although, admittedly, countless are - but because around 200 men are denied access to their children by secret family law courts every single day. Adding insult to injury, these men have no robust legal rights to see their offspring, despite being forced to pay for them via the Child Support Agency. Kate Winslet with her second husband, film director Sam Mendes, to whom she was married between 2003 and 2010 . Ironically, at a time when feminists are campaigning for women to appear on British bank notes (even though they already feature The Queen) men frequently spend tens of thousands of pounds to obtain court orders that aren't worth the paper they're written on. Meanwhile, grandparents don't fare any better either. Which, Nadine says, is another reason why her work is as relevant as ever. 'F4J is even more important today than it was back in 2001 because society has become so engrained with the anti-father rhetoric that children are growing up with a warped sense of self-worth and family,' adds Nadine, who confesses particular concern for her own son. In fact, she has a stark message for all men and boys: stay single and childless. 'Don’t do it. Don’t get married and don’t have children. As it stands you have no rights whatsoever and statistically being a father does not have a happy ending - you will be reduced to the status of a sperm bank and a cashpoint. 'Everyone knows somebody touched by the cancer of family breakdown. We are only looking for a cure.

So what needs to change in order for everyone to benefit from equal parenting? A massive, time-consuming, expensive overhaul of the legal profession and governmental child care agencies? Perhaps not. 'It's very simple,' she says. 'In fact, it may be too simple for the government to comprehend. All they need to do is change the law to give both parents equal rights and to make the starting point 50/50.

Mother-to-be Eystna Blunnie, 19,  was beaten to death by Tony McLernon, 24, in Harlow, Essex, just days before she was due to give birth in June 2012. A report by the Safer Harlow Partnership, a group of organisations working together to reduce crime, suggested there were many signs she was in danger. Danger signs: Eystna Blunnie, 19, (left) was murdered by Tony McLernon, 24, (right) in Harlow, Essex. A report by the Safer Harlow Partnership revealed he had threatened to kill her two months earlier . Two months before her death, McLernon squeezed her by the throat until she could no longer breathe while threatening 'he would kill her'. Essex Police asked the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) for advice on whether he could be charged with an offence at the time. The CPS decided there was not enough evidence but later admitted the had made the wrong decision. The report also revealed McLernon had a history with mental health service providers. McLernon kicked and stamped on Miss Blunnie, leaving her for dead in the middle of the road. He was jailed for life at Chelmsford Crown Court following a trial in March and will serve a minimum of 27 years. Miss Blunnie’s father Kevin said he believes his daughter would still be alive if McLernon had been prosecuted earlier. He said: 'For that mistake, we lost our daughter and granddaughter. Missed opportunities: The father of Miss Blunnie (pictured) said he believes his daughter would still be alive if McLernon had been prosecuted earlier . 'In our hearts, we feel had action been taken at that point, it would have made a difference.' The report’s author, Jackie Sully, said no one could be sure if charging McLernon would have changed the course of events leading to Miss Blunnie’s death. She was concerned that agencies involved in domestic violence cases did not share information internally or with other organisations. She said: 'If nobody is getting the bigger picture, how on earth can you take steps to prevent what sometimes seems inevitable?' A Essex Police spokesman said: 'We acknowledge the findings of this review and we have worked hard to address the recommendations that have been made. 'We are committed to improving the police and partnership working that underpins the effective combating of domestic abuse.' The CPS have been contacted for comment.

"By . Martha Cliff . The world's largest wine tasting competition returns to the UK this summer, and it is women who are expected to crack open the Champagne. The Palate contest, launched by wine merchant - Oddbins, has announced it's annual search for the UK's best amateur wine taster and is expecting to see more entries than ever before with 25,000 entrants anticipated. The last few years have seen a succession of women sip their way to victory with the past two winners being female. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Ana Sapungiu is set to hold the prestigious title of Master of Wine . But it is not just The Palate that is seeing women take the wine-world by storm, a highly prestigious title, Master of Wine is seeing more and more of a female influence too. Ana Sapungiu is soon to become one of the less than three hundred Masters of Wine worldwide and will be one of the younger ones in the UK. She agrees that when it comes to wine, she is seeing far more of a women's touch. 'I think the industry probably is more male . dominated, however recent movements have seen women with more dominant . roles. Traditionally women have been less confident in the industry but . they have more confidence nowadays.' Ana gives you the low-down on how the oh-so-sophisticated yet surprisingly simple art of wine tasting. 'My first most important tip would be to . surround yourself with friends, it makes it less complicated and more . fun. 'Go for one that's a bit different. 'Look at the colour if it is pale . it will be a lighter drink and if it's darker it will tend to be . heavier. 'Smell it, if it's fresh and vibrant it will have a lighter . taste if it smells spicy it might be more concentrated and richer in . flavour. 'Take a good sip, not a gulp but a good sip and try and draw . some air through it to open up its flavours. 'Now swallow, there is no . point in spitting unless it tastes horrible! 'See how long the taste . stays, if it's two seconds it is probably not a very good wine, if it's . around twenty then it is a much greater quality.' Ana says, despite the fact the past three winners of The Palate have been women, she doesn't necessarily think that women are better wine tasters as such, but she agrees that they are an equal match for men. 'What I would say is that our last two . winners of the Palette competition have been women, so they are at least . as good as men, but none is better than the other. It is just amazing . to see so many women engaging in the wine industry.' With over ten years experience in the industry, does Ana have any advice on what makes a good wine taster? 'You have to . have a mixed knowledge and to know all aspects but it is also about . being able to communicate clearly and actively with people about the . wine, it's a pursuit of knowledge. 'What . I always tell my customers is if you like the wine then it's a good . wine! There are a few faulty wines out there and you can tell if they . are if they smell musky or unfresh.' Even with this advice on board, contestants must ready themselves for some tough competition with only 64 of 25,000 entrants making it through to the semi-finals. The competition starts in 35 individual Oddbins branches before the semi-finals that will take place in London this June. The semi-finalists will enjoy the priceless opportunity to learn from one of four renowned wine experts in the UK at a 'boot camp', where their taste-buds will be out to the test by the best in the business. Last year's judges Peter Richards and Susie Barrie, both Masters of Wine, will be joined this year by writers Sarah Ahmed and Joe Wadsack. Each judge will host their own boot camp for 16 semi-finalists before selecting just four participants each to go forward to the grand final in September. Wine Masters Susie Barri (left) and Peter Richards (right), with Ana Sapungiu (centre) at last year's contest . Ana Sapungiu with Chloe Dickson, Winner of The Palate 2013 (left) and Chloe receiving her prize (right) The overall winner of The Palate 2014 will walk away with a trip for two people to Australia to visit some of the finest vineyards in the country. Ayo Akintola, Managing Director of Oddbins, said that despite the fierce competition, they are trying to take away stuffy stereotypes that often come with wine tasting. 'We are committed to making wine appreciation as unstuffy, approachable and democratic as possible. 'Last year's finalists, most of whom were incredibly surprised to discover they had a talent for wine appreciation, came from a very diverse range of backgrounds. 'The format this year introduces some fun rivalry between four of the UK's leading wine experts, who will be tasked with preparing their boot camp winners for the rigours of the grand final.' Susie Barrie, says the competition has the same talent scouting aspects as popular reality TV. 'The Palate is wine's answer to The Voice. It's a brilliant way for everyone in the country to give wine tasting a go and discover just how good their own palate is. The idea is to be challenged, have fun and not feel intimidated by wine, and we can all raise a glass to that!'

"By . Martha Cliff . Meet the hefty members of Britain’s latest fit club. Daisy the bulldog and Poppy the rabbit are among porky pets in the PDSA’s competition to highlight the dangers of animal obesity. The charity will put 17 pets through a six-month diet and exercise programme overseen by vets, leading to one being crowned a super slimmer. Daisy, from Middlesbrough, weighs in at 4st 6lb, which is 50 per cent heavier than she should be. Scroll down for video . A veterinary nurse holds bulldog Daisy from Middlesbrough, who weighs 28kg - she is one of 17 of the UK's podgiest pets, who are competing in an annual competition known as Pet Fit Club . Andy Cage from PetAID hospital says that obesity is one of the biggest animal welfare problems . She has already hit the treadmill in an attempt to shed the pounds. Poppy is a third heavier than she should be at more than 7lb – mainly due to a taste for popcorn. Other candidates include a cat that can open the fridge and a Jack Russell with a taste for doner kebabs. According . to the PDSA, pet obesity levels are at worryingly high levels. Around . one in three dogs and one in four cats are said to be overweight. Zorro, a three-year-old ginger Tom from Dundee, has a whopping 63cm waist and is double the size he should be, weighing a hefty 9.4kg. Devoted owner, Linda Petrie, 51, who adopted Zorro a year ago, now has to use baby wipes to keep her moggy clean, as he struggles to groom himself due to his size. Linda says that his eating habits have also become a bit of a pain: he is very demanding and often wakes Linda in the middle of the night for his favourite snack, cheese and onion crisps. Ginger Tom Zorro has become so overweight he is unable to groom himself . Zorro has a whopping 63cm waist and weighs a hefty 9.4kg . A fellow competing cat, Tom from Glasgow, is also classed as morbidly obese and has become so addicted to food he has learned to feed himself. The black and white kitty has got such an appetite he can now open the fridge door with his paw and force open cupboard doors as he is not satisfied with three pouches of food a day. His owner Elizabeth Molloy, from Glasgow turned to the PDSA after she found it easier to pick up her one-year-old granchild than her chubby cat. Elizabeth admits that she hasn't helped the situation, having indulged Tom's sweet tooth by feeding him ice cream. She says that since she moved into sheltered accomodation 18 months ago, his weight issues have worsened. Tom has become so desperate for food he has learned how to open the fridge . 'He's a house cat but in my previous home he had room to run up and down the stairs. But since I moved, he's not getting the exercise.' She also blames her cat's incessant appetite for his extra pounds, saying that he will stop at nothing to get his food fix. 'He's also very greedy. I have another cat, Angel, who is the perfect weight. But I have to put her food away when Tom's about because he will steal it.' And it's not just cats who are cramming, podgy Poppy and jiggly Joey are two bulbous bunnies from Aberdeen. Poppy the rabbit loves to snack on popcorn . Joey got chubby over the winter when his owners fed him extra snacks . Despite owning a perfectly proportioned English setter, the rabbits' owner Donna Manson, 48, said that her bunnies just piled on the pounds. Poppy, who loves to snack on popcorn, weighs 3.3kg - around 30 per cent more than she should. While Joey tips the scales at 3.85kg, making him 28 percent overweight. Donna said that her rabbits are not dissimilar to us, piling on the pounds over winter, the peak time for comfort eating. Vets at the PDSA help the overweight animals to lose weight with a specially tailored plan . 'Over the winter time I think we just bulked them up a bit too much. We've now cut the treats right back but we have been feeding them portions that are probably too large. Donna says that she had no idea that some of the treats she was giving to her bunnies were so fattening. 'I've tried to cut down on the carrots and apples, as I've recently learned that they are both high in sugar and not the healthy snacks I thought they were. 'Another thing that came to light was that I'd often give them a little treat during the day and when my daughter got back from college she hadn't realised I'd given them a snack and she would give them something too.' The Pet Fit Club has been running for nine years and has helped animals lose a combined weight of 46 stone . PDSA Pet Fit Club was launched in 2005 and has already helped 57 dogs, 24 cats and 3 rabbits lose a total of 295kg (46 stone 6lb). This weight loss is the equivalent of nearly 300 bags of sugar, more than 4,400 sausages, 740 tins of dog food or over 1,000 blocks of lard. Senior Veterinary Surgeon, Andy Cage, from Dundee PetAid hospital, said that having over weight animals is not just a nuisance, it is also an issue of cruelty. 'Obesity is one of the biggest welfare issues affecting pets in the UK today. Sadly, it also means millions of pets are at risk from potentially life-threatening health problems related to obesity. 'But the good news is that obesity is entirely reversible.'","Pet Fit Club returns for its ninth year to help slim down the podgiest pets .

"By . Martha Cliff . When it comes to a cup of London tea you'll be lucky to grab one for much less than £2.50, however, one extravagant blend has just raised the bar when it comes to an overpriced brew. The prestigious Royal China Club on London's affluent Baker Street has just launched the world's most expensive brew, setting you back no less than £180 a pot. The pricey tea is created from the leaves of the Da Honh Pao (Imperial Red Robe) that are treated much like a fine wine as they are left to mature to gain flavour for 80 years before being served. Pricey pot: The Da Honh Pao tea at the Royal China Club will set you back no less than £180 . Although a tea that costs the same price as a small computer may seem a little unreasonable the legendary Oolong artisan leaves earn their price through rarity, as they can only be harvested on certain days of the year. The tea also has royal endorsement, dating as far . back as the early 18th century, during the Qing Dynasty, when the . emperor Da Hong Pao was titled 'King of Tea' due to his love of the . beverage. Due to its high quality, Da Hong Pao tea is usually reserved . for honored guests in China. Served at exactly 95°c in the Royal China Club, the tea is handmade from tender leaves, withered, tumbled, curled and baked in small batches over charcoal to create an aromatic infusion with distinctive dark cocoa notes, a toasted fruity flavour and a long smooth aftertaste that lingers for several minutes after consumed. The tea was said to be enjoyed by the emperor Da Hong Pao during the Qing Dynasty . Peter Chan the sommelier at the Royal China Club says that brewing the tea at such a specfic temparature is not a gimmick but a necessity. 'Making tea is not simple – it is an art . form when you are using tea leaves as prized and delicate as Da Honh . Pao. It has to be brewed and served at exact temperatures - too hot or . cold and you risk killing the flavours. He continues, 'Tea masters from Hong Kong visit . the Royal China restaurants in London every couple of years to train . all staff in the art of artisan tea making.' The unique blend of tea is served at exactly 95°c to ensure the perfect flavour balance . Peter adds that maturing the leaves for so long adds a great depth of flavour to the tea. 'The tea leaves of Da Honh Pao are left to mature and gain . flavour for 80 years before being served. This helps to create the . unique flavor which is highly respected by tea connoisseurs around the . world.' He adds that this particular blend has an almost completely authentic taste. 'Like all teas, Da Hong Pao is now . processed and sold in many different grades, with some high grades reportedly as expensive as gold! These days, most Da Hong Pao on the . market is produced from clippings of the original bushes, resulting in . similar grades and tastes to the original.' Despite the hard work and craftsmanship that has gone into the tea the Royal China Club understand that not all tea lovers can quite stretch to the price of the cuppa. The Club also offers a range of 18 different types of artisan teas from various regions in China, starting from £4.80 for two. The Royal China Club restaurant on Baker Street is renowned as one of the most authentic Chinese restaurants in London. The restaurant is part of The Royal China Group, consisting of six restaurants. All the restaurants offer traditional Hong Kong Chinese dishes, while the Royal China Club combines European ingredients with the authentic Chinese cuisine. The group is renowned for its dim sum, which includes steamed seafood dumplings with spicy sauce and pan-fried fillet of duck breast rolls. Inside the luxurious Royal China Club . Designed by Stiff + Trevillion, a large aquarium containing lobsters, crabs, fish and seafood creates a focal point. Gordon Ramsay is a huge fan of Royal China Club, and when he was filming a slot on 'how to make dim sum' for the F word, Royal China Club was his location of choice for filming.","The Royal China Club has launched the world's most expensive tea .

"By . Martha Cliff . Daytime TV treasure, Lorraine Kelly, has taken to the fashion circuit to in a bid change older women's approach to style. The ITV presenter has today been announced as the brand ambassador of fashion retailer JD Williams, beginning her role as the brand relaunches in July for the autumn season. Lorraine will also dabble in the world of design for Spring of next year when she launches her own fashion collection for the brand that will be available from January 2015. Lorraine Kelly was today announced as the brand ambassador for JD Williams . The partnership will also see Lorraine feature in a brand new TV advertising campaign in a bid to cater for women in their 50s who feel as though other clothing retailers have let them down. For the daytime TV star - who is famous for her figure flattering outfit choices - this seems like the perfect partnership so it's a wonder she didn't do it sooner. However, Lorraine reveals that it has always been on her to do list. 'Designing a fashion collection has always been a dream of mine and I . am delighted to be working with JD Williams' said the presenter. Lorraine's collection for JD Williams will be available from January 2015 . The over 50 female fashion market in the . UK is currently worth £2.5 billion per season, and is the fastest . growing fashion sector, so it is surprising that it is so under-catered . for. However, Lorraine is hoping that her work with JD Williams might . help to change that. 'It's more than just . creating clothes though, I want to help women realise that they don't . have to give up on fashion once they hit 50; these days, age should not . be a barrier to looking terrific' she added. Lorraine, who is 54, said she had met many women her age who have struggled to find clothes that both flatter a slightly older figure while remaining stylish. 'As we . get older our bodies naturally change, and I receive so many questions . from women who want to feel stylish, but who get frustrated by the lack . of choice, size and fit on what's out there, and I'm now really excited . to be able to offer them a stylish solution.' In . addition to modelling and designing her own fashion collection, Lorraine . will be providing JD Williams' customers with regular tips and fashion . advice through social media, and other communication channels throughout . the year. Chief Executive of N Brown Group plc, Angela Spindler, said that when it came to choosing a brand ambassador, Lorraine Kelly was the perfect fit. 'I can't tell you how excited we all are. When we . looked at who we'd like to work with on a new collection Lorraine came . top in all our customer and colleague research. She's aspirational yet . accessible and always perfectly dressed, the prefect role model,' said . Angela. Angela added that they wanted to making fashion less of a stress for the older woman. 'We're . excited to be able to offer our customers great quality fashion at . affordable prices. Our mission is to make fashion easy and enjoyable . regardless of size or age. There's a real gap on the high street at the . moment, as no one seems to offer the over 50 woman the latest looks that . are designed to create a comfortable flattering fit.' Lorraine for JD Williams will be available in sizes ten to 32, with prices ranging from £20 for jewelled jersey top to £150 for an embellished party dress. Lorraine says that style doesn't have to end when a woman reaches 50 . Lorraine, who is 54 herself, says she has met many women in their 50s who have struggled to find clothes that are both flattering and stylish .","The over 50's female fashion market is worth £2.5b .

"By . Sophie Borland . Nearly half a million women are being denied a 7p-a-day pill that could prevent breast cancer because of NHS red tape. Those with a family history of the  illness should be offered Tamoxifen or the similar drug Raloxifene, which can cut their risk by 40 per cent. The medicines watchdog NICE urged doctors to offer the pills to high- and moderate-risk women for prevention last June. Cheap cure: Those with a family history of breast cancer should be offered Tamoxifen or the similar drug Raloxifene, which can cut their risk by 40 per cent, and cost less than 7p per day . The drugs cost less than 7p a day, and experts say giving them to at-risk patients will not only save lives, but millions of pounds in treatment costs for chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery. However, a year after doctors were told to start prescribing them, the drugs are yet to be licensed for use – despite the fact they are known to be safe. As a result, GPs are unwilling to hand them out, fearing patients could sue over any side effects. Doctors had been told to offer Tamoxifen or Raloxifene to any women over 35 who have more than a 17 per cent risk of breast cancer based on their family history, compared with the average risk of 12.5 per cent. This amounts to about 488,000 women in England and Wales – the equivalent of 3 per cent of the entire age group. Charities say they are ‘deeply concerned’ by the delay, which they fear could lead to women needlessly dying of breast cancer. Taking action: Conservative MP Jonathan Evans  is introducing a Private Members' Bill urging Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to grant new licences for the breast cancer drugs immediately . Mia Rosenblatt, head of policy at . Breast Cancer Campaign, said: ‘It’s incomprehensible that there are . low-cost, effective treatments out there which are not routinely . available to patients because of red tape. 'Bureaucracy is preventing potentially . life-saving drugs from being made available to the thousands of women . who could be eligible for them. ‘Any delays could mean the difference between life and death for thousands of patients, and this is simply unacceptable.’ Last year’s guidelines were hailed by . campaigners as a ‘truly historic moment’ and a ‘tangible’ way for women . to drastically reduce their chances of getting the illness. Taking too long: Medicines watchdog NICE urged doctors to offer the pills to women with high- or moderate risk of breast cancer  last June . But 12 months later, the charity says there is no evidence the drugs are being used on any ‘substantive scale’. This is because the official Medicine and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency has still not licensed the drugs for the purpose NICE has already recommended them for. Breast Cancer Campaign added that such delays are also preventing a further 34,000 women with breast cancer being given a drug that could cut their chance of dying by 17 per cent. It wants all sufferers over 50 to be offered bisphosphonates, which cost less than 30p a day. They are routinely used to treat osteoporosis, but research has shown they also prevent breast cancer spreading to the bones. The charity is backed by Tory MP Jonathan Evans, who is introducing a Private Members’ Bill urging Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to grant new licences immediately. He also hopes it will also be used for other drugs which have been licensed for one condition, but have been shown to be effective at treating another. ‘It clearly makes sense to address this barrier to accessing drugs and I’m delighted to have the opportunity to do so,’ he said. Around 50,500 women develop breast cancer in the UK every year and it causes 11,500 deaths. Of those diagnosed, around 2,400 patients have inherited faults in known breast cancer genes including BRca 1 and 2. Both Tamoxifen and Raloxifene are licensed in the US to prevent breast cancer, and are taken by around 40,000 women – but researchers say this figure is still ‘very low’. The drugs work by blocking the hormone oestrogen, which is known to trigger the growth of cancerous cells. However, they can cause side effects such as hot flushes, headaches, nausea and, in rare cases, blood clots and strokes.","Breast cancer drug can cut risk by 40 per cent for women with family history .

"By . Tara Brady . Gifted linguist and pianist Colin Achgill, 18, had been a student at Atlantic College for almost a year . A talented young musician at a prestigious boarding school leapt to his death after his school prom, an inquest has heard. Gifted linguist and pianist Colin Achgill, 18, moved from the United States after winning a place at the prestigious Atlantic College on the Welsh coast. However, an inquest heard how mystery surrounds the reason why he slipped away from his group of school friends after the prom evening and tragically jumped to his death from a sea cliff. Colin had travelled from Indianapolis to study at the prestigious Atlantic College in Llantwit Major, South Wales, where he stayed as a boarder for almost a year. He had previously spent a year studying in China. The international private school is housed in the 12th century St. Donat’s Castle, where newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst once entertained Charlie Chaplain, and was founded in 1962 as a liberal worldwide education movement for peace. An inquest in Cardiff yesterday heard how Spanish and Chinese-speaking student Colin jumped to his death from the cliff tops near the extensive school grounds. Friends said the popular student disappeared after they returned to their boarding house following a school prom on Saturday March 22. Schoolfriend Fin Henrik told police Colin had been drinking alcohol before he disappeared around 11pm but didn’t appear drunk. He said: 'We were all consuming alcohol but I wouldn’t say he was drunk. He seemed his normal happy self. 'I didn’t see him after that and when he didn’t come home for the curfew we all started looking for him.' Colin had travelled from Indianapolis to study at the prestigious Atlantic College in Llantwit Major, South Wales . A school-wide search was launched by staff before the police were called around 3am. Fin said he went back out to search for Colin around 6am on the Sunday morning and discovered his discarded black rucksack and iPod on a cliff top coastal path. He said: 'I spotted Colin’s black rucksack and an iPod placed on top of his bag. I saw a message he had left on the iPod which was on his main screen and had been written at 11.30pm.' Friends said the popular student disappeared after they returned to their boarding house . The inquest heard the message Colin left made it clear he wanted to take his own life - but was not read aloud to the inquest. His body was discovered by coastguards on the rocks below the high sea cliffs where his rucksack was found. Heartbroken father Dennis said his family had spoken regularly with Colin during the school term and never realised anything was troubling him. Mr Achgill said: 'I never detected anything was wrong. He was well respected by his peers and enjoyed the academic environment. 'He seemed to thrive. He learned Spanish in six weeks during a Summer immersion course in 2010 and during an academic course in Beijing had learned Mandarin with distinction. 'I was proud to see how well he was doing and I dreamed of even bigger things for him. 'I don’t know or understand what led to this disaster - I wish I did.' Assistant Coroner Christopher Woolley said the level of alcohol in Colin’s blood was below the legal driving limit and he was 'in full possession of his faculties' when he jumped from the cliff. He said: 'Colin was a very good student, very well liked, and clearly a very able young man who had achieved a lot already in his life. 'The note he left in his iPod stated clearly and categorically that he wanted to end his own life. 'His father said: ""I don’t know the causes that led to this disaster”, and that must be echoed by everyone who knew him. 'He gave no clues to anyone that he intended this dreadful thing.

'The care at Atlantic College is very good and I am satisfied there were excellent procedures to take care of a student if there were any issues.

Officers stumbled on the plans made up of a series of coded messages between a 29-year-old Algerian butcher living in the south of France known as Ali M and a high-ranking member of al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. The member of al-Qaeda was known online as Redouane18. Le Parisien newspaper reported that in April last year the married father-of-two was contacted by his al-Qaeda contact. Ali M suggested targeting nuclear power plants, 'planes at the moment of take-off' and French landmarks which included the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre museum in Paris. He even suggested targeting people in market or nightclubs as well as cultural events which attract thousands of Christians. According to The Telegraph, he wrote: 'The mainways become black with people and a simple grenade can injure dozens of people, not to mention a booby trapped device', he said. The al-Qaeda member advised Ali M to fly to Algeria where he could benefit from combat training. However, the Algerian was arrested last June - a month before he was due to fly to Tunisia and then to Algeria. According to the man's lawyers he was brainwashed. Marc Trevidic, one of France’s highest-profile anti-terror judges, said there are more cases like Ali M's in France. He told  Le Parisien: 'There are doubtless others on our soil programmed to harm French interests.' Last month French police arrested Mehdi Nemmouche, a French jihadist who fought in Syria, and allegedly killed four people at the Brussels Jewish Museum in May after travelling back to Europe.

"By . Tara Brady . A father-of-three died from a heart attack the day after being sent home from hospital by an inexperienced nurse who misdiagnosed his chest pains as high blood pressure. Terry Best, 46, was pronounced dead after he was found slumped in his car outside a garden centre on November 28 last year. The previous day he had stopped off at the minor injuries unit at Whitworth Community Hospital in Matlock, Derbyshire, after getting chest pains while driving to work. Kerry Best says the NHS let her husband down after he was sent home by a nurse with chest pains . Despite showing sky-high blood pressure, an emergency nurse did not have enough experience to interpret an ECG heart scan properly. Mr Best was discharged just 25 minutes later and told to attend his GP instead of being referred for emergency care which may have saved his life. He was able to make an appointment with his doctor for the next evening but collapsed and died in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, earlier that day. An inquest at Milton Keynes Coroner’s Court in May concluded there had been a failure by the nurse to refer Mr Best for emergency care which resulted in a lost opportunity for him to receive necessary treatment. Terry Best who died of a heart attack the day after being discharged from hospital pictured with his wife Kerry . His wife Kerry Best, 40, who lived with Terry in Moseley, Birmingham, said NHS staff had let her husband down. She said: 'I knew Terry must be feeling very unwell for him to take himself to hospital as he was never one to make a fuss. 'I was relieved when he phoned to say he had been seen as I thought at least now he was in safe hands. 'To hear at the inquest that more could have been done to help him was very difficult to comprehend and I’m still struggling to come to terms with it now. 'I can’t understand why the emergency nurse allowed Terry to go home, it seems like common sense to me, that someone with central chest pains requires urgent treatment. 'I believe that the nurse was too reliant on a poorly drafted protocol. 'Terry was so full of life and a devoted husband and father.' Sent home: Terry Best was pronounced dead after he was found slumped in his car last year . Mr Best, who worked as a manager for a large garden centre company, had suffered with high blood pressure and high cholesterol for some time. He first began to experience intermittent chest pains, dizziness and pins and needles in his left arm in November last year. He decided to go to hospital on November 28 after the chest pains, which would occur approximately every 30 minutes, came on particularly strong as he drove to work. At his inquest, Senior Coroner for Milton Keynes Tom Osborne recommended that Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Trust implement a revised ‘Unwell Adult Protocol’ for patients with chest pain to ensure they received emergency care. Shortly after the death, the Trust commenced a ‘Serious Incident Investigation’ to ensure that lessons were learned. The investigation highlighted that they required more explicit protocols in place to ensure that adults with chest pains were treated appropriately. The Trust has now confirmed it has revised its ‘Unwell Adult Protocol’ for patients with chest pains to prevent further deaths. Mrs Best now wants the protocol to be implemented in all community hospitals nationwide to ensure all patients with chest pains have access to the appropriate treatment as quickly as possible. 'It gives me some peace of mind to know that the Trust has revised and implemented its protocol, as encouraged by the coroner, but it won’t bring Terry back' Kerry Best, Terry's husband . Mrs Best, his wife of 11-years, who is also the mother to two of Terry’s children aged 18 and 11, said: 'It gives me some peace of mind to know that the Trust has revised and implemented its protocol, as encouraged by the coroner, but it won’t bring Terry back. 'We are determined to see justice for what has happened and hope that the Trust will now work with our legal team to conclude our case so the children have financial security and we can begin the very long process of rebuilding our lives.' Adam Wright, a medical law expert at Irwin Mitchell lawyers, which is representing Mr Best's family, said: 'This is a tragic case that has left Kerry struggling to come to terms with the loss of her husband and three children without their dad. 'We are pleased that the Trust has now implemented a revised protocol for adults presenting with chest pains, albeit too late for Terry. Terry Best stopped off at the minor injuries unit at Whitworth Community Hospital the day before he died . 'We will now continue to investigate on Kerry’s behalf, whether Terry would not have died if he had received emergency treatment. 'We are also looking to secure the family financial security for the future; given Terry was the main breadwinner. 'The NHS must continually strive to learn lessons from any shortcomings and make improvements to its services as a whole to provide the best possible care. 'We believe that the revised ""Unwell Adult Protocol"" should be implemented nationwide, in all Community Hospitals, so that every adult patient with chest pains who might present at such a centre is safeguarded and referred for specialist treatment that could save their life.'","Terry Best, 46, was pronounced dead after he was found slumped in his car .

"By . Tara Brady . A multi-millionaire philanthropist embroiled in a High Court financial fight with his estranged wife today told a judge that money does not bring happiness. Financier Sir Chris Hohn told Mrs Justice Roberts 'you cannot take money with you'. Sir Chris and his estranged wife Jamie Cooper-Hohn, who have homes in England, the United States and the West Indies, cannot agree who should get what share of a fortune said to run into hundreds of millions of pounds. Sir Chris (left) and his estranged wife Jamie Cooper-Hohn (right) cannot agree who should get what share of a fortune said to run into hundreds of millions of pounds . They are fighting over assets totalling more than £700 million at a private hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London. He says she should get a quarter of their fortune. She says she should get half because the wealth was created as a result of their 'partnership'. Mrs Justice Roberts has allowed journalists to attend the trial - one of the biggest divorce money fights seen in an English court - but has placed limits on what can be reported. Sir Chris said he visited the Philippines aged 20 and seen poor children and he said by his mid-30s he had been in a position where he could retire and raise money for charity. 'I visited the Philippines and saw terrible poverty and said if I ever had the money to help children before I would,' he said. Split: The couple, both thought to be in their late 40s, married in 1985 but separated in 2012 . 'My life is not motivated by money. I live a very simple life. I live day to day. My life has been about charity.' He added: 'I learned very early on that you cannot take money with you and it doesn’t bring happiness.' Mrs Cooper-Hohn had earlier told the judge that she worked long hours on behalf of their charitable foundation and travelled. She said they had met when studying in the United States - at Harvard near Boston. She said both had wanted to 'make the world a better place'. Sir Chris said it had 'always been discretionary' as to what Mrs Cooper-Hohn did with her time. He said there had been 'no deal or arrangement'. After being asked why their marriage had broken down, Mrs Cooper-Hohn had said Sir Chris had been in 'conflict' with his sister and 'at war' with his sister. Mrs Justice Roberts has heard how the couple, both thought to be in their late 40s, had married in 1985 and separated in 2012. Mrs Cooper-Hohn could be awarded a record sum. Lawyers have told the judge that despite their wealth the couple had not lived a 'jet-set lifestyle'. The judge said their way of life had been described as a 'Swatch' rather than a Rolex lifestyle.","Financier Sir Chris Hohn is embroiled in a divorce battle with estranged wife .

"By . Tara Brady . Hundreds of people have been evacuated from tourist boats on the River Thames after a passenger ferry collided with a barge carrying rubbish near the iconic OXO Tower. A number of people on board the City Cruises vessel were hurt - including at least three with neck injuries - following the crash at around 2.15pm opposite the Oxo Tower, near Blackfriars Bridge, in central London. The casualties included two teenager boys and three women aged in their 70s, 50s and 30s but none had to be taken to hospital. Hundreds of people have been evacuated from a tourist boat on the River Thames after a passenger ferry collided with a barge carrying rubbish . One boy . was treated for a graze to his leg and another for shock, the women aged . in their 70s and 30s were treated for neck pains and a woman in her 50s . suffered a knee injury. The Millennium Time has a capacity of 340 and is one of a fleet operated by City Cruises. A . fleet of ambulances were lined up on South Bank ready to take . casualties to hospital and several River Police vessels were at the . scene. The City Cruises vessel was visibly damaged but did not appear to be sinking. Some . of the passengers on board the stricken passenger ferry were being . transferred to other boats as a full-scale rescue operation swung into . action. A crew member of a Thames pleasure cruiser giving tourists a running commentary of the sights is said to have been desperately waving his arms and shouted 'turn turn' before a rubbish barge rammed into it. Thames pleasure boat and a tug collide near Oxo Tower Wharf in central London . Couple Sandra Gonzalez and Andres Ramirez were on the top deck of the boat with their two children aged nine and 13. Ms Gonzalez said: 'One second we were just sailing down the river from Westminster, looking at all the famous buildings and next we saw this boat heading straight for us, it was so scary. 'The guide was telling us about the places along the Thames, but because he was looking at us he didn't see the other boat until someone shouted. 'He started calling to the other boat and waving his arms, he was shouting 'turn turn'. 'Our boat rocked hard to the left and people were screaming, we thought we were all going to get really hurt or something worse. Damage to the City Cruises vessel following the collision today on the River Thames in London . 'The boat managed to turn enough so we didn't hit each other head on, but because it was towing the barges they smashed into the front of ours. 'We all held on to our seats, but thank god the impact was not too hard.' The family from Bogata in Columbia, were spending the first day of their holiday sightseeing after arriving in London yesterday. Mr Ramirez said: 'We were sat just four seats from the front on the top, but it was much worse for the people sat right below us. 'It's sunny so there were mostly people on top, but the people on the bottom deck got covered in glass when the windows were smashed in. The City Cruises vessel was visibly damaged but did not appear to be sinking . 'Some people looked like they were hurt badly, they were bleeding. 'It was lucky it hit the side, if not the injuries would have been much worse.' Ms Gonzalez added: 'We wanted to go to Greenwich - we'll take the tube next time instead.' Eyewitness . Clare Lawrence tweeted: 'Drama on the Thames! Just heard a huge . thud/crash, city cruiser hitting a cargo boat! Surrounded by police . boats..' While . Author Oliver Payne tweeted: 'Boat crash on the Thames near OXO Tower. One of those tourist boats head on with a refuse barge. Everyone's . okay.' Steve . King, duty helmsman told the MailOnline: 'There was quite severe damage . to the front. A couple of windows were smashed and there was glass . everywhere. 'A lot of people were shaken and had cuts and bruises. We counted nine minor injury casualties. Hundreds of people have been evacuated from tourist boats on the River Thames after a passenger ferry and cargo boat collided near the iconic OXO Tower in central London . 'Considering the damage they were all very lucky. I feel lucky that there were not any major casualties to deal with.' Mr King said there were 362 passengers on board at the time. A . spokeswoman for City Cruises said: 'Today at 14:25 the Millennium Time - . part of City Cruises' sightseeing fleet - made contact with a . commercial vessel while sailing by Coin Street on the River Thames. 'Seven minor injuries have been reported, none of whom were hospitalised. 'All . other passengers were guided off the boat promptly by City Cruises, who . continue to do everything they can to support the authorities and those . involved in the incident. It is believed there are a small number of people with minor injuries including cuts and whiplash . 'Investigations are ongoing and more information will follow pending its conclusion. 'The Millennium Time will return to Cherry Garden Pier for repair and all other City Cruises services are running as usual.' Safety . on the Thames was overhauled in the wake of the Marchioness disaster in . 1989, which saw 51 people die when the pleasure cruiser hit a dredger. Scotland Yard said today that neither boat was at risk of sinking after the collision and that it was too early to speculate on the cause of the crash. A . Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'Police were called to the Thames, near . the Oxo Tower, at 2.15pm today following reports of a passenger ferry . and cargo boat in collision. 'The . Metropolitan Police's Marine Support Unit, Coastguard, London Fire . Brigade and London Ambulance Service are all in attendance and are . currently in the process of taking those on board the ships to shore. The Metropolitan Police's Marine Support Unit, Coastguard, London Fire Brigade and London Ambulance Service are at the scene where the boats collided . Operation: Scotland Yard said today that neither boat was at risk of sinking after the collision . 'At this stage there are believed to be a small number of people with minor injuries including cuts and whiplash. 'Nobody from either vessel entered the water following the collision, and neither boat is believed to be at risk of sinking.' Police said it was 'too early' to speculate what caused the collision. City Cruises, that was set up in 1985 . and has a fleet of 19 boats, carries more than two million passengers . each year on sightseeing, entertainment and private charter trips. Police said it was 'too early' to speculate what caused the passenger ferry to crash with the barge . A London Ambulance service spokesman added: 'We were called to a boat collision on the Thames near South Bank at 2.20pm. 'We treated three patients for neck pain at the scene. 'Another . patient treated for minor injury. We sent two ambulances, a duty . officer and hazardous area response team to the scene.' The London Fire Brigade also sent its boat to the scene of the crash. A spokeswoman said: 'The fire boat has been called to reports of a collision between two boats on the Thames near Waterloo Bridge. 'Firefighters are assisting the police and the RNLI at the scene.' Safety regulations on the River Thames have been tightened since the Marchioness tragedy which claimed 51 lives a quarter of a century ago. It was that August 1989 disaster, when the pleasure cruiser Marchioness, full of partygoers, collided at night with the dredger Bowbelle and sank in the Thames near Southwark, that prompted an urgent look at the dangers on Britain's most-famous river. For example, at the time of the sinking there was no Royal National Lifeboat Institute (RNLI) services on the Thames. Emergency crews at Waterloo Pier join in the massive rescue operation after The Marchioness sank in 1989 . Now there are four - at Tower in the heart of the city, at Chiswick in west London, at Gravesend to the east of the capital and Teddington in south west London. The RNLI provides a search-and-rescue service to any point within the tidal reaches of the River Thames between Canvey Island in the east to Teddington. All four stations are all permanently manned, this is because RNLI Lifeboat crews on the Thames are required to be afloat within 90 seconds of being notified of an incident. Figures for 2013 showed that lifeboat crews rescued 372 people from the Thames, It is estimated that 25 of those saved would have died without the help of the RNLI. The charity's annual report also revealed that Tower station, which is next to Waterloo Bridge, was the busiest in the UK and Ireland in 2013. Its crews were called out 492 times, rescued 128 people and saved 19 lives. Tower, Chiswick and Teddington lifeboat stations were launched for 733 shouts throughout the year.However, as the Marchioness proved, the key to safety on the Thames and other rivers, is vigilance. The inquiry into the 1989 disaster concluded that the tragedy happened because neither vessel had a proper lookout.","A number of people on board the City Cruises vessel were hurt .

"By . Tara Brady . Boden Hughes sparked a blaze by smoking cannabis on a ferry to Amsterdam putting the lives of more than 1,000 passengers and crew at risk . A passenger has admitted starting a fire on board a ferry which at the time was estimated to have caused a massive £815,000 worth of damage. Boden Hughes sparked a blaze by smoking cannabis in cabin 568 of the DFDS north sea vessel on December 28, putting the lives of more than 1,000 passengers and crew at risk. The boat which had been en route to Amsterdam and was 30 miles out at sea was forced to return to the Port of Tyne and people had to be winched to safety. Some needed treatment for smoke inhalation. At Newcastle Crown Court yesterday the 26-year-old, from Sunderland, pleaded guilty to arson being reckless to life being endangered and affray. At the time the damage he caused was estimated to have cost £815,000 - but the exact figure will not be revealed until a later hearing. His guilty pleas are on the basis he had discarded a lighter he was using to heat cannabis resin onto a pile of clothes on the bed. The lighter, which has been adapted to produce an ongoing flame, caused the clothes and bedding to quickly catch fire. Prosecutor Ian Lawrie QC said: 'It was a spectacular piece of recklessness.' Mr Lawrie said Hughes was in such a “drink and drugged” state he was unable to do anything about the fire he had started once it took hold. Hughes will be sentenced for the arson offence, along with a cable theft conspiracy he had already confessed to, in September. Judge James Goss Qc told him: “Be under no illusions as to the seriousness of the crimes you have admitted today. 'This was very serious offending which will attract a substantial sentence of imprisonment.' Hughes had tried to avoid being brought to justice over the fire when his defence team made an application last month claiming the English courts had no jurisdiction to try him on the charges. Christopher Morrison, defending, said the alleged offence happened outside British territory, which extends 12 miles out to sea. But Judge Robert Adams ruled that the English court does have jurisdiction, despite the alleged offence happening 28 miles out. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Boden Hughes admitted starting the fire which at the time was estimated to cause £815,000 of damage . The judge said legislation under the Merchant Shipping Act and the Senior Courts Act state that British citizens accused of offences at sea can be tried under English law. Judge Adams said: 'The court does have jurisdiction to try this case.' James Curry, 29, of Calshot Road, Castletown, Sunderland, admitted a public order offence and common assault in relation to what happened on the boat. He will be sentenced with Hughes. Passengers on a crossing from Newcastle to Amsterdam complained of being 'treated like animals' Fights reportedly broke out as passengers were forced to cram on to outer decks for safety . U-turn: The ship was forced to return to dock in Newcastle. Passengers were questioned onboard . Both men have been remanded in custody. Two crew members and four passengers had to be winched off the DFDS Seaways vessel after breathing in smoke as a blaze took hold in cabin 568. A further 15 passengers and eight crew members were treated by doctors for smoke-related injuries after the incident. The ferry was forced to return to the Port of Tyne, where Hughes was arrested. Some 946 passengers and almost 130 crew were on board the Amsterdam-bound ferry. Family members hugged in relief at the ferry terminal when they were finally allowed off, with some vowing never to sail again. Julie Bell and Shaun Richardson, from Washington, Tyne and Wear, were on a weekend away.At the time she said: 'It was like a scene from a movie, a chaotic mess, horrible. 'It was terrifying and I won’t be travelling by boat again. I think I will stay in the UK from now on, it’s a lot safer.' RAF helicopters from Leconfield near Hull and Boulmer, Northumberland, were scrambled to the vessel along with RNLI lifeboats from Bridlington and Filey. As he was led away, Hughes, dressed in a grey sweatshirt for the hearing, said: 'Thank you, Your Honour.'","Boden Hughes, 26, from Sunderland, sparked a fire on a ferry to Amsterdam .

"By . Paul Thompson . and Alasdair Baverstock In Caracas, Venezuela . The five-year-old girl left orphaned after her beauty queen mother and British dad were shot dead in Venezuela has been given the shattering news about their horrific deaths and has left hospital to attend their funeral, it was revealed today. Tragic Maya Spear is being comforted by her grandparents and extended family after being treated for a gunshot wound to her leg. Yesterday, the brother of former Miss Venezuela, Monica Spear Mootz, said the family had yet to tell Maya that her mother and father, Thomas Berry, were dead. Scroll down for video . Despicable: Maya was also shot by the robbers who killed her mother and father in cold blood. The brave girl has now left hospital and been given the crushing news they are dead . Support: Maya is in the care of her parents' extended families and who she will ultimately live with has yet to be decided. Her paternal grandfather told MailOnline: 'We . will discuss it with her family once the parents have been seen off . properly' But on her release from hospital the bewildered little girl was told the shattering news. The couple were gunned down during a robbery on the Puerto-Cabello to Valencia highway in Venezuela's Carabobo state on Monday. Maya was in their car with them and suffered a glancing wound to her leg during the robbery. She was treated in hospital but did not require any surgery. Family members arriving in Caracas from Florida, where most of Monica's family now live, told MailOnline that Maya had been allowed to leave hospital and was being cared for by her mother's cousins. She is now expected to attend the funeral of her 29-year-old mother and ex-pat British father on Friday in Caracas. Her fate has yet to be decided, according to her . grandfather. 'We still . don’t yet know whether Maya will remain in Caracas with us or go to . Orlando to live with Monica’s parents', said Thomas Berry Sr, speaking . at the lying in state ceremony in Caracas’s East Cemetery today. 'We . will discuss it with her family once the parents have been seen off . properly,' he said. 'For the moment Maya is staying with some of Monica’s . cousins in Caracas. The most important thing is that she is safe'. Grief: The bodies of Berry and Spear were open for public viewing on Thursday at the Eastern Caracas Cemetery ahead of a funeral tomorrow . Mourning: Two cousins of Monica Spear attend the cemetery where her body and that of her brother are lying in state. Her brother, Ricardo, right, addressed the awaiting press outside . Crowds: Huge numbers of people turned up to the cemetery to pay their respects. The deaths have sparked protests and convulsed the crime-ridden country . The couple's five-year-old daughter Maya survived the shooting after being hit in the leg and is recovering in a Caracas hospital, although she doesn't yet know that her parents are dead . The . pair, who were never formally divorced, were taking a New Year holiday . as a family following more than a year’s estrangement which many thought was a sign of reconciliation. 'They . truly loved each other, and their daughter only cemented their love”, . said Monica's father, Rafael Spear, who had flown in from his home in Orlando to attend . his daughter’s funeral. Monica was an American citizen, and although she had spent the last few years in Venezuela, where she is a TV star, she had lived with her parents for years and was a graduate of the University of Central Florida. 'We all expected them to return from holiday . with the news tat they were back together again'. The . camera bag belonging to the murdered Miss Venezuela Monica Spear has . been found in the possession of the only woman arrested in connection . with the case. Several family members caught at 6am flight from Miami to Caracas to join up with others who had been flown to Venezuela on a jet chartered by the country's president. Maya is being looked after by her cousins and also Rafael and his wife, Inceborg, and Berry's parents Tom and Kate who live in Caracas. The bodies of Berry and Spear were open for public viewing on Thursday at the Eastern Caracas cemetery. Loving: Former Miss Venezuela Monica Spear Mootz and Thomas Berry had maintained a good relationship following their divorce and family say they were close to getting back together for the sake of Maya . Hundreds of mourners are expected at the funeral on Friday as Spear was well known in the south America country having been named Miss Venezuela in 2004. She also appeared in a popular soap opera which brought her an even bigger fan base. As family members made final preparations for the funeral new details emerged about the gang alleged to have carried out the brutal killing. The only woman among the six arrested was found to have Spear's camera bag in her possession. The female bandit is known as Eva ""Guns"" Mejias. Authorities were quizzing Mejias and six men aged from 15 to 26. The group which believed to have carried out the murder acted from a building where they were squatters known as El Churro, a notoriously dangerous government project in the region. Horrific: Robbers shot through the car windscreen when the terrified family locked themselves in . Brutal: The gang, known as the 'Los Rapiditos', wasted no time in gunning down the couple in front of their daughter . Theft: Police revealed today they recovered Spear's camera bag from a female member of the alleged gang . Trap: Police believe the killers deliberately left something in the road to cause a puncture on their car . Residents of El Cambur, the village close to the squatters den, have told local press that their lives had been ruined by the invasion of the building by the dangerous gang a few years ago. 'Before we could go where we wanted, but since they moved in and established a ""Red Zone'. 'I have to take a different route home at night to avoid it?, one resident of the sector told El Nacional. 'There are police and military patrols on the highway, said  Mary Gonzalez, another resident of El Cambur. But there is no phone signal, a lot of places to hide and although everyone knows where the gang is squatting no one has done anything about it'. 'It's only now that this tragedy has occurred that they have done anything.' The couple and Maya are believed to have been targeted by the robbers after they left an obstacle in the road, causing the car to tire to puncture. A tow truck arrived and was being loaded onto it when the armed gang approached. It is believed the couple locked them inside and the gang fired through the windows, killing them and injuring Maya. The only two witnesses to the crime are two men from the road rescue team who fled for their lives as the couple were in the car. The deaths of the couple has outraged millions in the crime plagued country. The country's President Nicolas Maduro has promised a crackdown on crime in a nation that had more than 24,000 homicides last year. Love: Relatives said they told Monica to return to the US. but said she was so in love with the country and wanted to teach her daughter about it . Maduro called for a security meeting with all the country's governors and the mayors of the 79 cities with the highest crime rates. 'If there's any sense to this pain, it has to be so that we all wake up,' he said. Police chief Jose Gregorio Sierralta said they were killed after locking themselves inside their Toyota Corolla to stop their attackers stealing their car as the tow truck driver and an assistant ran to a police checkpoint a mile away for help. Monica's family told NBC News they had . tried and failed to persuade the former beauty queen, to leave violence-racked Venezuela and join them in the . United States after she was robbed six times. 'She loved her country too much,' said her brother, Ricardo. 'It was her home.' Her ex-husband shared her passion for Venezuela and worked as an adventure tour operator. He moved to the U.S. about 15 years ago after being shot, but returned to Venezuela in 2006, his business partner said. 'I . think he was kind of naïve because he loved what he did and he loved . showing the good side of Venezuela,' Luis Dominguez said. People gather in a demonstration in Caracas, the Venezuelan capital, to protest over the death of Monica Spear . A still from a short film showing the actress riding before she blew a kiss to the camera on the day she died . 'To think there are people who can . shoot a mother and father in front of their daughter is very sad and . unbelievable,' family friend Diego Sanchez said. 'And it's shocking when . it happens to someone you know.' As well as Maya's grandparents from Orlando, Berry's parents Tom and Kate were at her bedside. Berry's sister Katie, who lives in Edinburgh, was expected to join her retired university maths professor dad and mum. She and her brother moved to Venezuela as young children but she returned to Britain to find work with her Venezuelan husband. Mr Berry, 39, a travel firm boss, also used to return regularly to Britain to see family and friends. Another family member described Ms Spear as a 'sweet young girl.' 'She was so sweet, just like you see her in the photos,' said her aunt Mayela. 'She was as beautiful a person on the inside as she was on the outside. 'She was very loving and dreamed of triumphing in French cinema after spending time in France where she learn't the language. 'There was no need for what happened. There's no respect for life anymore.' Spear . and her ex had spent the New Year on a road trip that took them from . scenic Merida to the beach and to the plains, where the beauty queen . was raised on a ranch, rode horses. A video she posted to Instagram showed her blowing kisses to the camera on horseback.","Maya Spear was orphaned when her mother Monica Spear Mootz and father Thomas Berry were gunned down in front of her in their broken down car in Venezuela .

"By . Harriet Hernando . These lucky ducklings are now in safe hands after being rescued from a drain. When a passer-by heard cheeping coming from a grill near Marton Road, Middlesbrough, they alerted the RSPCA. Inspector Clare Wilson managed to lift the cover but was unable to reach the birds, so the fire brigade was called in. Safe and sound: The five ducklings which were rescued by the RSPCA and fire brigade after getting stuck down a drain near Marton Road, Middlesbrough . The ducklings were rescued by the RSPCA and fire brigade who lifted up the drain cover with a crowbar .

"By . Paul Thompson . A Tacoma, Washington mother who sent sexually explicit texts to a 14-year-old boy in an attempt to lure him into bed has been jailed for nine months. But the sentence was not enough for the victim's mum who said the 37 year old, Shakira Anderson, got off lightly and showed no remorse. 'I don't think she's mentally stable and I don't think it will change the way she behaves', said the boy's mother. Sharia Anderson, 37, will only be serving nine months behind bars for texting her daughter's 15 ex-boyfriend . Her husband added that he was glad they found out about Anderson's inappropriate behavior before their son had sex with her. Speaking after seeing Anderson jailed, the father said: 'It's anger, it's frustration.  There's even a little relief that we actually caught it before anything bad happened.' He said Anderson still poses a threat to other underage boys. 'I don't think there's going to be any change with her. I think in the future she's going to be at risk when she's back out.' The father declined to be named to avoid his son's identity being revealed. A court in Tacoma, Washington, heard that Anderson began texting the teen after he broke up with her daughter. She repeatedly sent him sexually explicit text messages while trying to convince him to have sex with her. The boy's parents found the text messages on his cell phone and alerted police. The boy's mother, who did not want to show her face or reveal her identity, said that she didn't think the woman was given a long enough sentence . Anderson pleaded guilty to communicating with a minor for immoral purposes in January. At the sentencing Pierce County Superior Court Judge Frank Cuthbertson lectured Anderson telling her the investigation into her behavior showed she didn't take the charges seriously and didn't consider herself a sex offender. 'Kids are not to be played with,' said Cuthbertson. 'They are not toys, they are human beings.' Anderson asked to be allowed to serve half of her nine-month jail sentence on electronic home monitoring. Judge Cuthbertson denied her request and ordered her to undergo a psychosexual evaluation while she is in jail.","The victim's mother thinks Shakira Anderson, 37, was given too light a sentence .

"By . Paul Thompson . and Daily Mail Reporter . A U.S. army officer accused of sex offenses in three states is to be allowed to use an 'evil twin' defense to try and escape being jailed for life. Lt Aaron Lucas plans to blame his identical twin brother for the crimes. The artillery officer, who was awarded the Bronze Star for valor, is accused of being a sexual predator who roamed the towns near his military base in Fort Carson, Colorado, trying to abduct and assault young girls. Decorated artillery officer Lt Aaron Lucas of Fort Carson, Colorado, plans to blame his identical twin brother Brain for a series of sex offenses . He was arrested last year in connection with a child abduction and an attempted child abduction over the summer. But detectives realized the 32-year-old matched the description of a suspect in as many as 11 attempted abductions. DNA taken from an attempted abduction in Colorado matched samples taken from crime scenes in Alabama in 2007 and Texas two years later. Lawyers for the officer claim the DNA was from his twin brother Brian, who lived in both states at the time of the attacks. As identical twins the brothers share the same DNA. 'War hero': Aaron Lucas is the recipient of the Bronze Star, the fourth highest military honor in the country . Brian Lucas has not been charged and could not be located for comment, reports the Colorado Sprngs Gazette. It said Brian Lucas had previous addresses in Madison and in Texas. Aaron Lucas' attorneys say an unidentified third man is responsible for the Colorado assaults. El Paso County prosecutors said the Colorado victims' ages ranged from six to nine and that they were targeted at random in Colorado Springs and nearby Fountain by a man who tried to coax them into sex with promises of money and ice cream. Prosecutors contend three girls were assaulted during the encounters. The incidents began shortly after Aaron Lucas' arrival at Fort Carson with the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division. A Colorado Springs police detective, Fred Walker, has testified the assaults stopped while Aaron Lucas was deployed to Afghanistan. Stationed: The crimes began shortly after Aaron Lucas' arrival at Fort Carson with the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division . Lucas received . the Bronze Star, the fourth-highest honor given to members of the . military, for valor during a deployment to Afghanistan. In his four years of active duty, Lucas amassed a glowing military resume including 10 medals and awards. He is being held at El Paso County jail on $1.2 million bond. He goes on trial in January and could face life behind bars if convicted. A judge in Colorado Springs, Colorado, has said she will allow Lucas to blame his twin brother. District Judge David Shakes ruled Friday it would be 'inappropriate' to bar 1st Lt. Aaron Lucas' lawyers from presenting his identical twin as an alternate suspect given the siblings' shared DNA. 'Whether it's persuasive or not that's not my role,' the judge said. 'It's the role of the jury.' Karen Steinhauser, a criminal defense attorney and adjunct law professor at the University of Denver, told The Associated Press such an argument is rare. 'I have never seen it, ever,' she said. 'The only time I have seen it was on Law And Order: SVU,' the television show.","Lt Aaron Lucas, 32, is accused of being a sexual predator who roamed the towns near his Fort Carson military base trying to abduct and assault young girls .

"By . Stephanie Linning . The Qatar World Cup might not be until 2022, but one tiny inhabitant of the Arab state has already caught football fever. These spectacular photos capture a bee as it balances a droplet - or ball - of water on its back, demonstrating incredible skills that rival those of celebrated Argentinian striker Lionel Messi. The talented bee is pictured balancing two droplets on his head, before it drops one in order to stay in control. Doubling up: The daring bee shows off incredible skills as it balances two droplets on its back while perching on the end of a flower. The photos were taken after it was sprayed with water in a garden near Doha, Qatar . Fast footwork: Even after dropping one of its water droplets, the determined bee keeps its composure as it continues with its feat - stepping lightly across the petals of some delicate white flowers . Next step: The insect demonstrates its flawless technique and ambition as it moves from one flower to two. It manages to balance the water droplet on the back of its head as it takes a step between stems . Keeping the droplet positioned carefully on the back of its head, the insect then makes the daring move across a number of flowers. Its incredible control over the ball is reminiscent of that shown by Messi on the pitch at this year's World Cup. The striker will hope to lead his team through to the next round of the tournament when they take on Switzerland in Sao Paulo tonight. The photos were taken by photographer Agus Sudarmanto, 50, who uses special macro photography techniques to capture the incredible close-up pictures. Mr Sudarmanto, who lives near Doha, Qatar, said: 'There is no rain at all here so we have to pour and spray water periodically on flowers and small trees.

The photographer who took the image said it was the first time he had seen anything like this and that he did not want to miss the moment . 'This is the reason there were drops on the bee but it was amazing how it was just delicately balanced on his back. 'I take a lot of macro photography in an old play area as there are a lot of insects in the bushes.

"By . Tara Brady . The wife of a notorious crime boss has claimed she just 'lives beyond her means' after denying using her husband's hidden wealth to finance their lavish lifestyle. Actress Ruth Adams told the High Court that she and her husband Terry Adams are so short of money they may have to move in with their parents. Mrs Adams, who was once in Eastenders and recently appeared in the musical Fings Ain't Wot They Used T'Be, said she had failed to earn much from her career as a stage actress and from her clothing and interior design business. North London gangster Terry Adams, 58, (right) of the notorious 'Adams Family', pictured today at the High Court in London with his wife Ruth (left) However, Kennedy Talbot, prosecuting, said she is hiding the profits made by her husband from when he was a 'career criminal'. According to Mr Talbot, Mrs Adams has spent thousands since her husband was released from prison in 2010. They include £12,000 on dental treatment; £2,500 on a weight loss programme; £3,850 on spa membership for her husband; More than £5,300 on parking fees, fines and congestion charge between 2009 and last year; nearly £15,000 on restaurants and holidays including 20 meals at Brown's in Mayfair and a trip for her daughter and husband to China. In court: Terry Adams, 58, (right) with his wife Ruth (left) Mr Talbot said this amount of spending indicated the couple were not poor and so the court should reject their application to have the outstanding debt from the confiscation order written off. Mrs Adams has also claimed she has debts of more than £150,000. She told the court: 'I obviously live above my means. What else can I say?'. According to Mrs Talbot her acting career had only brought home between £8,000 and £9,000 in recent years. She also employed her husband as creative designer for her clothes company N1 Angel because she could see that her husband dresses well. Mr Talbot argued that the company was not a 'legitimate business'. Yesterday Mr Adams said he felt like 'a ponce' living off his wife's income. Mr Adams has been described in the courts as once heading one of the most feared organised criminal gangs in the UK. The 58-year-old owes £628,497 of a confiscation order of £750,000 that was imposed after his conviction at Blackfriars Crown Court in 2007 for conspiring to conceal the proceeds of criminal conduct over a six-year period. He was also ordered to pay prosecution costs of £50,000 and the £4.6 million bill for his publicly funded defence. A judge said he had accumulated a 'considerable fortune' from his life as 'a highly successful career criminal' over a 'significant' period of time. Mr Adams is currently seeking a court-approved 'certificate of inadequacy' to show that he does not have sufficient assets to pay back the money sought by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) under the confiscation order. New career: The crime boss (left) claims he is working for his wife Ruth (right) for free as a 'creative' clothes designer. He also told the court that he was 'frustrated' about his lack of income . But the CPS says there is 'a strong case' that he has 'substantial undisclosed assets'. Mr . Talbot, representing the CPS, suggested to Mr Adams at London's High . Court that loans said to have been taken out by his wife because times . were hard were not genuine. Cross-examining . Mr Adams he said: 'These are not genuine loans at all. This is just . your money being routed to you through fabricated arrangements.' Denying the accusation, Mr Adams replied that he had said all along, from the time when he was in prison, that he had no money. Lavish: Thousands of pounds spent by Mrs Adams include 20 meals at Brown's in Mayfair . Mr . Adams said to Mr Talbot: 'Now we are here and you are saying we have . this money I have not got, but how do I prove this to you?' He . told Mrs Justice Nicola Davies he was relying on money from his wife, . adding: 'I feel like a ponce because there is no money coming in.' Asked . whether he knew about his wife's interior design business, he said he . did but she kept it 'all away from me' and she knew 'I get frustrated I . am not bringing in money. She is the breadwinner, not me, and it is . difficult for me anyway.' Claims: He said he is too poor to pay £750,000 as part of a confiscation order and wants to have the debt cleared on grounds of 'poverty' The . CPS says Mr and Mrs Adams' average 'identifiable' spending in the three . years from September 2010-2013 was £97,000 per annum - 'nearly four . times the national average'. The . type of spending was 'inconsistent' with his claim of having no assets . and of being reliant on friends and family loans for living expenses, Mr . Talbot has told the court. Mr . Talbot argued that the evidence showed a pattern of behaviour that was . 'entirely consistent with the original criminal case against (Mr Adams) of concealing his assets through associates and using sham companies to . provide an apparent form of legitimate income'. The hearing will continue. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","The gangster claims he is working for his wife, Ruth, as a clothes designer .

"By . Hugo Gye . A Viking metal rod which left experts baffled for more than a century has finally been identified as a 'magic wand' used by a witch to cast spells. The staff, which was found in a ninth-century grave, is curved at the end - causing it to be misidentified as a fishing hook or a spit for roasting food. However, archaeologists have now concluded that it was in fact a magical item belonging to a sorceress who was 'on the margins of society'. Magical: This curved rod is believed to have been a staff belonging to a Viking sorceress in the 9th century . They suggest that the reason it was bent . before being buried with its owner was to remove its magical properties . - possibly to prevent the witch coming back from the dead. The 90cm-long rod has been part of the . British Museum's collection since 1894, when it was discovered in . Norway's Romsdal province. It had been buried next to a woman's body alongside other valuable items including an unusual plaque made of whalebone, implying that the person in the grave had a high status in Viking society. Its unusual shape, with a knobbly 'handle' and a hooked end, originally led historians to believe that it was a practical object used for catching fish. Outcast: A reconstruction of how Viking witches could have looked as they wielded their fearsome staffs . Power: Runes, seen carved on a standing stone, are thought to have had magical associations . Magical rituals are thought to have been central to many early medieval societies, but in most regions the advent of Christianity displaced them and obliterated all trace. However, Scandinavia was not converted to Christianity until the late 10th and early 11th centuries, meaning that we have much more historical and architectural evidence about their pagan beliefs. The magic apparently carried out by the owner of the British Museum staff is known as 'seithr', and was usually carried out by women sorceresses. It was used for both peaceful and aggressive purposes - some practitioners claimed to use their skills to predict the future, but others cast spells to curse their enemies. The runic alphabet, used to write Scandinavian languages before the coming of Christianity, is also thought to have had magical associations. Roman author Tacitus described how Germanic priests would write symbols on pieces of bark before casting them as lots to tell the future, while the great god Odin was said to have had special skills in rune-reading and divination. After Christianity came to the Norse world, traditional magic began to die out - but only after the old and new faiths went through a period of conflict. The 10th-century King Hakon of Norway was brought up a Christian, but after ascending to the throne he found himself pressured to take part in pagan rituals which involved eating horse liver at a pubic feast. They later decided that it was in fact a . skewer for roasting meat - but after comparing the rod with other . similar objects, experts have now reached a different conclusion. British Museum curator Sue Branning says that it was probably a magical staff used to perform 'seithr', a form of Viking sorcery predominantly practiced by women. 'Our rod fits with a number of these rods that turn up in the ninth and 10th century in female burials,' she told The Times. 'They normally take the form of these long iron rods with knobs attached to them.' The curve in the end of the staff is . likely to have signified that it was being put out of use, a common . practice in the medieval period for grave goods which were routinely . broken when they were buried. Bending . or breaking the buried possessions of the dead could have served to . neutralise their magical properties - preventing their former owners . from casting spells from beyond the grave. 'There . must have been some kind of ritual,' Ms Branning said. 'This object was . ritually ""killed"", an act that would have removed the power of this . object.' Although Viking society, like most . medieval societies, was dominated by men, some women were believed to . have special powers which made them influential figures. Ms . Branning said: 'These women were very well respected, but they were . quite feared as well. They may have been on the margins of society.' Because . the Vikings were not converted to Christianity until around 1000 AD, . there is strong evidence for the importance of magic in their society at . a time when the rest of Europe had largely abandoned the practice. Fierce: But women could be prominent figures in Viking society despite the common image of it as being dominated by warriors; medieval enthusiasts are pictured celebrating Hogmanay in Edinburgh this week . Display: The staff will be placed in a new gallery in the British Museum alongside other early medieval treasures such as this belt buckle from Sutton Hoo . Runes, the pre-Christian writing system used in Scandinavia and elsewhere, have long been thought to have had magical associations and were apparently used to tell the future. The witch's staff will go on display in the British Museum's new early medieval gallery, which is set to open on March 27. The room will also contain highlights of the museum's collections including the Anglo-Saxon treasures found at Sutton Hoo.","Metal rod with curved end was found in a grave in Norway and taken to the British Museum .

"By . Stephanie Linning . and Martin Jay In Beirut . The Lebanese wife of extremist preacher Omar Bakri, who once praised the 7/7 bombers as the 'fantastic four', is applying for UK asylum for herself, her husband and their two children. The radical Islamic cleric, who was once the subject of UK terror investigations, faces the death sentence for running a terror cell in Lebanon and claims he has been tortured, according to reports. Ruba Bakri, 30, said that she is in the . process of applying at the British Embassy in Beirut on behalf of her family, despite the fact that Bakri was permanently barred from the UK. The Lebanese wife of radical Islamic cleric Omar Bakri, pictured speaking at a 2002 rally, is applying for asylum for herself, her husband and their children - despite the fact that Bakri was permanently barred from the UK . When asked whether she was applying for asylum she said: 'In the UK and everywhere. For me, my husband and children, yes I am applying,' according to Lebanese newspaper An Nahar. Speaking last month, a home secretary said: 'Omar Bakri Muhammad was permanently excluded from the UK in 2005 on the grounds that his presence is not conducive to the public good. 'As Omar Bakri Muhammad is excluded from the UK, he will be unable to make a claim for asylum.' In 2005, Bakri told reporters in Beirut that he would never return to the UK. He is currently in . custody and is facing the death sentence in a trial which is expected to . begin in Lebanon today. Last month, he was formerly charged with being the . mastermind of a terrorist cell in Tripoli, Lebanon, and is currently in . prison awaiting trial. Bakri left behind his British wife and their seven children when when he fled Britain in 2005. He married Mrs Bakri in 2008 and later had two more children. Destruction: Wreckage of the number 30 bus that was hit during the 7/7 attacks. Mr Bakri once praised the London bombers as the 'fantastic four' and was the subject of terror investigations in the UK . Mrs Bakri claims that the cell he is living inhumane, saying that he cannot squat to use the toilet. Speaking to Lebanese press, she said: 'To say the least, I want them to change the cellar [sic] that he’s living in now, the bathroom, and that they give him the proper medication. 'I don’t understand how he deserves this treatment. He didn’t do anything to get treated so horribly.' Bakri, who holds Syrian and Lebanese citizenship, lived in Britain for 20 years and led radical group Al Muhajiroun until it was disbanded . Authorities in Lebanon believe that Bakri is linked to Al Qaeda and is responsible for a series of attacks both on Army personnel in recent months and inciting sectarian fighting in Tripoli, which left 30 dead and over 160 wounded. Bakri, who holds Syrian and Lebanese citizenship, lived in Britain for 20 years and led radical group Al Muhajiroun until it was disbanded. The group's co-founder Anjem Choudary said in an earlier interview with Lebanese press that he was hoping that Al Qaeda’s chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi would intervene and release western hostages in exchange for Bakri’s freedom. Bakri, whose real name is Omar Bakri Fustoq, was arrested on May 25 and has always denied being part of Al Qaeda although he regularly speaks highly of their affiliated groups both in Syria and in Lebanon. Bakri, who known as the Tottenham Ayatollah when he lived in London, faced possible treason charges over his support for the London bombers in 2005 and fled Britain for Lebanon. He said the British people were to blame for the terror attacks on the capital because they ‘did not make enough effort to stop its own government committing its own atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan’. He also sparked outrage when he said on TV that he would not inform police if he knew Muslims were planning a bomb attack on a train in the UK and supported Muslims who attacked British troops in Afghanistan.","Extremist cleric Omar Bakri once praised 7/7 bombers as the 'fantastic four'

"By . Paul Thompson . Robert Chesters (pictured) is accused of drugging his own daughter, so he could have sex with her friend . A widowed father of three has been accused of drugging his 12-year-old daughter so he could have sex with her friend during sleepovers at his home during a three week period. Robert Chesters, of Lebanon, Connecticut, is alleged to have given his daughter a liquid sleeping aid so that he would not be disturbed when he slept with her friend. The 42 year old is alleged to have met the young girl when his daughter brought her to their home in for sleepovers in August. Police said text messages found on the girl's phone suggested Chesters was drugging his own daughter so that she would sleep while he had sex with her friend. One message said: 'I am so lost without you :-( [blank] is gone next weekend And [blank] will have Benadryl so you can lay with me comfortably and love me,' according to a text from Chesters to the girl on Sept. 8. Another text read: 'When we made love last night your heart really showed through everything.' Court papers revealed Chesters suspected the relationship wouldn't last and he even texted her at 7 a.m. on the day police were closing in on him. 'As a last resort tell them [blank] will lose her dad for ten years if they say anything. No matter what happens I LOVE YOU.' he allegedly wrote in the text message. The relationship was discovered by the girl's friends who found the text messages on her phone and told authorities in their middle school. He spoke to officials at her middle school who tipped off police. When police went to arrest him on September 11th , Chesters was found sitting in his pickup, unresponsive and a suicide note on the floor. He was taken to hospital and then to prison once he had recovered. In court last Wednesday, Chesters pleaded not guilty to first-degree sexual assault and risk of injury to a minor. His next court appearance is on November 21.","Robert Chesters, 42, allegedly gave his daughter Benadryl so he could sleep with her friend undisturbed .

"By . Kate Lyons . A woman whose four guinea pigs were brutally murdered believes the attack might be the latest attack from a 'serial pet killer'. Amanda Milligan returned to her Cairns home at 10.30pm on Friday to find the bodies of four of her guinea pigs on the driveway. One had had its throat slit, the other had its chest cut open and two others appeared to have suffered blunt force trauma, she believes from being bashed against the driveway. Amanda Milligan - pictured here with her five-year-old daughter, Candice - returned to her Cairns home to find four of her guinea pigs slaughtered . Two of the guinea pigs, Miss Aurora and Temprance, were Ms Milligan's pets and two Angel and Maisy were rescue guinea pigs. Maisy, was heavily pregnant with twins. 'I was gutted. I can't comprehend why,' she told MailOnline. Ms Milligan runs the Guinea Pig Haven Rescue Shelter and is known in the area as someone who takes in unwanted or injured guinea pigs. The incident happened on Friday and Ms Milligan believes it may the latest attack by a 'serial pet killer' She believes the assailants came in through the front gate, were confronted by her two dogs, which were then locked in the garage, before proceeding to the front of the house where the guinea pigs were kept in a table-top cage. 'We don't know if they were originally trying to break in or if the guinea pigs were the sole intent of the mission,' she said. Ms Milligan said one of her dogs and her cat were harmed in the incident and her cat is now terrified to go into the front yard. She is worried that the attacks might be the work of a serial pet killer. 'I believe there was another dog killed a couple of nights after the [guinea] pigs were killed. Someone is taking pot shots at large birds, not killing them, maiming them. It seems a little too much of a coincidence that it's been happening in the same area,' she said. Ms Milligan (left) said the attack - that left one pig with its throat slit, another with its chest cut open and two others with blunt force trauma - had 'traumatised' her children, including Candice (right) Ms Milligan, who has nine other guinea pigs, said she is worried that the assailants might return for the rest of the animals, or worse, her children. 'I have two young children, a five-year-old and a two-year-old, I'm concerned that once [the attackers] get bored of killing animals they'll go to another target – children or the elderly,' she said. Ms Milligan said the attack had 'traumatised' her two children, aged two and five. Her older daughter asked her mother if the guinea pigs had 'gone to be with grandpa', Ms Milligan's father, who passed away less than a year ago. 'It's still heartbreaking trying to explain to her that they're not coming back and that they're with grandpa now and he'll look after them,' she said. Clockwise from top left: Maisy, Angel, Temprance and Miss Aurora were all killed in the attack on Friday night . Police are investigating the incident and they are today conducting autopsies on the guinea pigs to establish the cause of death. Senior Constable Andrew Abraham described the incident as a 'very disturbed attack' and said police were looking into whether this incident might be linked to any other crimes in the area. Ms Milligan has offered a $500 reward, raised from the donations of supporters, to anyone with information about the crime. 'We need someone to pay for what they've done,' she said. Posters have been put up around the area of the attack in the hope that people might come forward with information .","Four of Amanda Milligan's guinea pigs were murdered on Friday night .

"By . Peter Barrow . and Martin Beckford . A judge in the James Bulger case sparked anger last night as she defended the release of one of his killers and cast doubt on links between watching child porn and carrying out sex abuse. Jon Venables was set free last week after serving three years in jail for downloading horrific photos of sex assaults on children. Baroness Butler-Sloss, who gave him and Robert Thompson lifelong secret identities after they committed one of Britain’s most notorious child murders, said he did not deserve to be locked up for ever. Anger: James Bulger killer Jon Venables and retired judge Baroness Butler-Sloss . And she denied there was evidence to show that paedophiles who seek out indecent images online also carry out physical assaults. But her remarks have been criticised by James Bulger’s mother, while campaigners said there was a wealth of evidence that those who watch child abuse will go on to target children in real life, including the recently convicted murderers of April Jones and Tia Sharp. Lady Butler-Sloss said she sympathised with the victim’s parents but added: ‘Venables was not killing children. He was engaged in watching child porn. It is a very nasty offence but a different one. ‘There is no evidence that those who watch child porn go ahead and do it. Not to my knowledge. There may be evidence but I have not come across it.’ Victim: Little James Bulger with his mother Denise . She added: ‘When he has served his . time, as long as the Parole Board think it is safe for him to be . released, of course he should be released. 'He . has his rights, even though he murdered many years ago little Jamie . Bulger. He ought to be given a chance to live in the community.’ James’s . mother Denise Fergus, 45, said last night: ‘Baroness Butler-Sloss . obviously has no idea what a disgusting animal like Venables is capable . of doing. ‘A . lot of paedophiles start off by looking at porn on the internet and . then they move on to rape and murder. Venables did it other way round. He murdered first, aged ten. ‘Baroness . Butler-Sloss made the order that gives him his legal anonymity. She . should hang her head in shame at what she enabled him to do, let alone . pontificate about him deserving a second chance.’ And Tory MP Julian Brazier, a member of . last year’s Parliamentary inquiry into online child protection, said he . ‘strongly disagreed’ with the former judge’s comments. Two-year-old James Bulger is seen on CCTV camera being led away by Jon Venables and Robert Thompson . ‘The evidence presented to the commission was overwhelming. There is ample evidence of correlation and we have seen an alarming rise in children who have become sexual predators,’ he said. Lady Butler-Sloss, 79, was president of the Family Division of the High Court when in 2001 she granted the unprecedented lifelong anonymity order to the pair who, aged just ten, tortured James Bulger to death after snatching him in a Merseyside shopping centre. The judge ruled that because of the risk of revenge attacks, the ‘uniquely notorious’ Venables and Thompson deserved protection when they were released after serving eight years in custody for the 1993 killing. In 2010, Venables was put back behind bars after receiving a two-year sentence for possession and distribution of indecent images and videos. The Old Bailey heard that pictures of children as young as two were found on his computer. Despite pleas from James Bulger’s parents, the authorities decided last week that Venables – now aged 29 – could be freed with a fourth new identity to help protect his anonymity. Several academic studies and research by law enforcement agencies have found evidence of a link between child abuse images and sexual assaults. Last year, the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre said there was ‘compelling evidence’ that anyone in possession of abuse images should be seen as a threat to children.",Baroness Butler-Sloss denied there was evidence to show that paedophiles who seek out indecent images also carry out physical assaults .
"By . Neil Sears . and Mario Ledwith . and Richard Marsden . 'Talented': Valerie Graves ran her own craft studio and gallery called Fin Taw at the Harestanes Countryside Visitor Centre in Roxburghshire . A grandmother murdered in a £1.6million waterside mansion was attacked and killed in her bedroom, police revealed yesterday. Valerie Graves, 55, who had been house-sitting over Christmas with family, was found beaten to death with head and facial injuries on Monday morning. Although police released details of where mother-of-two Miss Graves died, they gave no indication they were any nearer to solving the mystery of her death. Miss Graves, an artist, had been staying at the house – in a village featured in ITV drama Midsomer Murders – with her sister Janet, 60, Janet’s architect boyfriend Nigel Acres, 59, and the sisters’ elderly mother Eileen, 87. She went to bed at around 10pm on Sunday, and nothing more was heard of her. Twelve hours later, she was found dead in her room, at the rear of the house. Ernie Mears, 80, who enjoyed a meal with Miss Graves’ family at the property on Boxing Day, said Miss Graves usually slept in a bedroom on the ground floor of the house and the other relatives normally slept in upstairs bedrooms. The retired builder, a friend of the victim’s mother, added: ‘I just can’t believe that somebody would break into the house … If it had been a burglary she would have screamed because Nigel, Jan and Eileen were upstairs.’ No struggle or cries for help appear to have been reported by her relatives in the house and police yesterday refused to say whether Miss Graves was asleep or in bed when attacked. While detectives have not ruled out the possibility she was killed by a random intruder, they are also investigating whether the attack was carried out by somebody  she knew. Scroll down for video .

"By . Mario Ledwith . Sir Paul: 'If your relationship is not stable enough to cope with children, you should not have them' Couples who want to have children should get married to provide a stable family environment, a High Court judge said yesterday. Sir Paul Coleridge said would-be parents have ‘responsibilities and duties to do right by [children]’, while also accusing politicians of displaying a ‘high level of ignorance’ towards the virtues of married life. The senior judge, who will retire from the bench next year after a career as a family lawyer and judge, said: ‘If your relationship is not stable enough to cope with children, you should not have them. 'If your relationship is stable enough to cope with the rigours of child rearing, then you should consider seriously adding the protection of marriage to your relationship.’ Almost half of births in England and Wales are now from unmarried mothers, according to the Office for National Statistics, which recorded a record figure of 47.5 per cent last year. The family court judge’s remarks follow a report by a think-tank he founded warning that unmarried couples are four times as likely to break up than married couples. The research by the Marriage Foundation also said unmarried couples accounted for more than half of family breakdowns. Sir Paul, who has long been known for his strident, common-sense views on the issue of children and divorce, told the Daily Telegraph that the lack of support from colleagues on his views around marriage was partly to blame for his decision to step down from the judiciary next year. While insisting that he did not mean to ‘preach morality’, Sir Paul said many in the upper echelons of the establishment believe that cohabitation and marriage are indistinguishable. He said: ‘There is this idea out there that it doesn’t make any difference whether you cohabit or marry [to which I say] no it doesn’t – except one tends to last and the other tends not to last.’ Sir Paul also criticised selfish parents for being more concerned with their own ‘rights’ than the welfare of their children. He said: ‘In the courts people talk about . their rights – you have no right where children are  concerned. What . you have are responsibilities and duties to do right by them.’ Family values: Children will benefit from having stable married parents, said Sir Paul (posed by models) Sir Paul, a family judge in the High Court (pictured), insisted he was not 'preaching morality' but blamed a lack of support for his views on marriage for his decision to step down from the judiciary next year . Despite his impassioned defence of marriage, Sir Paul insisted that he was not suggesting that only those who are married should have children. He added: ‘I don’t think they should have children until they are sure that their relationship is stable enough to cope with the stresses and strains.’ Almost six out of ten pregnancies in England and Wales were outside marriage in 2011, records from the Office for National Statistics showed. The 57 per cent of conceptions to women who were not married compared with 52 per cent in 2001 and 44 per cent in 1991. A higher proportion of conceptions outside marriage end in abortion than those among married women. The latest figures show that just under seven out of ten conceptions to unmarried women ended in a birth, compared to more than nine out of ten pregnancies among married women. Motorbike enthusiast: Sir Paul Coleridge is a staunch defender of children after more than four decades in family law . Sir Paul Coleridge, 64, who is to retire after more than 40 years as a family lawyer and judge, has for years been an outspoken defender of children in family break-ups. Last week the straight-talking lawyer called upon warring parents to think of the impact of divorce in terms of the 'sheer pain and human suffering' it causes to children. He said: 'The children [of divorce] are given no choice, are never consulted, and only rarely considered before it and its effects are dumped into their young lives, slowly to release their legacy over the whole course of their upbringing and way beyond into their adult lives.' Married to Judith since 1973, he has three children and three grandchildren, and enjoys motorbikes, gardening and spending time in the Dorset countryside. He says he and his wife have been through 'good times and bad times' but says the key is to keep going. 'People also seem to think good, stable marriages arrive fully formed and drop out of the sky, and if you're lucky you'll catch one,' he said. 'But actually, long, stable marriages are carved out of the rock of human stubbornness and selfishness and difficulties. The way you make them work is by chipping away bits over the years so you end up with something beautiful.' Last year he set up the Marriage Foundation think-tank to champion marriage as a source of strength for families with children. He said: 'I have seen the fall-out from these broken relationships.  There are an estimated 3.8million children currently caught up in the family justice system.  That is a complete scandal.' A year ago, Sir Paul blamed the curse of Hello! magazine and other similar glossies for giving young people unrealistic expectations of marriage, saying aspirations based on celebrity lifestyle were 'dangerously flawed'. And in 2011 he said: 'Divorce is easy in the sense that obtaining a divorce is easier than getting a driving licence. 'It's a form-filling exercise and you'll get your divorce in six weeks if everyone agrees.' And he said there was no longer a stigma attached to divorce. 'In about 1950 you weren't allowed in the royal enclosure at Ascot if you were divorced,' Sir Paul said. 'That now would exclude half the Royal Family.'","Sir Paul Coleridge said parents should be close enough to endure marriage .

"By . Kate Lyons . and Louise Cheer . Death threats made against a New Zealand referee who disallowed a goal during a World Cup clash between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Nigeria are being investigated by police. Peter O'Leary has become deeply unpopular with Bosnian fans after their team lost by one goal to the African nation, sparking more than 23,000 people to sign a petition calling for his resignation. The disputed goal was scored by Bosnia's Edin Dzeko in the 21st minute of the match played on June 21. Further fuelling the outrage is a picture of the New Zealand World Cup referee laughing with the victors after the game - which has since gone viral. In the Change.org petition, Bosnian fans have also asked football governing body FIFA to amend the final score to 1-1, which would allow their team to advance to the next round in the tournament. Police confirmed to the New Zealand Herald on Tuesday they were liaising with Interpol after threatening comments were levelled at O'Leary by disgruntled fans. Peter O'Leary is pictured hugging the NIgerian goalkeeper after the match as Edin Dzeko embraces Shola Ameobi in the foreground . 'DIE PETER O' LEARY !!! Just die IDIOT!' one signatory wrote on the petition. Another wrote: 'If this petition doesn't do anything, I'm gonna go up to his doorsteps at (midnight) and burn him and his house.' New Zealand Football referee development officer Ken Wallace told the New Zealand Herald he had spoken with O'Leary after the match and said the World Cup referee was frustrated by the fans' reaction but was happy with his performance. Mr Wallace said O'Leary and his referee assistants would now undergo a FIFA review process. But the development officer had no concerns for his colleague's safety, saying security around referees in Rio de Janeiro was 'fantastic'. Bosnian fans have labelled him the 'amateur who ruined the country' after Peter O'Leary's refereeing decisions cost Bosnia-Herzegovina the match and the chance to progress out of the group stage . Bosnia's loss, which followed a 2-1 defeat to Argentina, meant the team was eliminated from the competition as they needed at least a draw to stand any chance of progressing. They play their third and final game against Iran on Thursday morning (Australia time). Dzeko's goal was disallowed on the grounds that he was offside - but replays showed he was actually behind the last defender and therefore onside. After the match a furious Dzeko said the referee was 'shameful' and had cost them the game. When asked what happened, he replied: 'The referee happened.' 'We are going home, we are sad because of that but the referee should go home too, because he changed the result, he changed the game, and that's why we lost.' Peter O'Leary came under fire for his decision to disallow the goal scored by Edin Dzeko in the 21st minute of the match . The petition, which calls for Peter O'Leary to be fired and for the score of the match to be altered, has attracted more than 20,000 signatures . The online petition, created by Kraxon UO from Sarajevo, has asked that O'Leary be fired from his role as a World Cup referee and the score of the match be changed to 1-1. 'The most of people that watched Bosnia-Herzegovina saw goal scored by Edin Dzeko in 20 minute,' the petition reads. It calls on FIFA to 'change [its] system of referees and to change [the] result to 1:1 because the goal was denied, also try to hire professional referees in World Cup 2014.' Underneath the picture of O'Leary and the Nigerian goalkeeper, the caption reads: 'This file should tour the world! Share the picture! Show them how much we are damaged!' Bosnian soccer fans have taken to social media to express their outrage at the decision, with one user captioning a picture of O'Leary: 'This amateur destroyed the country!' Another wrote: 'Clear the ref was against Bosnia even the commentators said that it was not off side when Bosnia scored. It was a foul when Nigeria scored. He pushed the hell out of the Bosnian player on purpose and you could clearly tell that. So not fair. Bosnia deserves to go ahead.' 'After everything that's happened in [Bosnia-Herzegovina] in the past 2 decades and the recent floods, this nation somehow made it to the World Cup and was on its way to put smiles on people's faces until this amateur robbed of us of what was rightfully ours,' wrote another. Football New Zealand and FIFA could not be reached for comment. This was the first time Bosnia-Herzegovina competed in the World Cup and they were eliminated from the competition after their loss against Nigeria . Bosnian fans in Sarajevo were devastated after their loss against Nigeria over the weekend .

"By . Harriet Hernando . Lawyer Robin Jacobs, 31, from London, was stunned to discover the outline of a penis imprinted on his Milkybar . A lawyer was stunned when he unwrapped a Milkybar - and discovered this likeness of a penis imprinted on the snack. Eagle-eyed Robin Jacobs, 31, noticed that an indented image of a horse's head looked like a giant phallus. The education lawyer believes the apparent presence of penis next to the famous Milkybar Kid is inappropriate for children. He said: 'It was a little bit surprising, I don't think I've ever seen anything like it before that's for sure. 'What on earth is a penis doing on a children's chocolate bar? There's no point denying what it looks like. It is obvious - we can all see it.' Mr Jacobs, from South Woodford, London, bought the 49p bar from a Tesco store to tuck into while watching the World Cup final on Sunday. He said: 'I eat an awful lot of chocolate but I don't often have Milkybars - in all honesty I only bought it because it was on offer. 'I was eating it during the football match and I wasn't really paying much attention. Then I looked down and I was surprised to see a massive penis staring up at me. Mr Jacobs, who normally sticks to Cadbury chocolate, opted for the Nestlé product for a change. He said: 'I'm normally a Cadbury man but I decided to give the Milkybar a go and look what happened. 'It's a completely inappropriate picture. The penis in question is even bigger than the child - surely the people making the bar can see what it looks like.' Mr Jacobs ate the Milkybar despite being put off. He . added: 'I never forget football matches and now the 2014 World Cup will . always be remembered as the 'Milkybar penis' - it's not a great way to . reminisce about it.'

The Milkybars are on me: The Milkybar kid and his horse are pictured in the imprint on the chocolate bar . Nestle denied the image was a penis and insisted it is in fact the horse's head . A spokesperson from Nestlé denied the image was a penis. She said: 'We're surprised and sorry to hear that Mr Jacobs thought the picture on the Milkybar resembles male genitalia. It is in fact an image of a horse's head belonging to the Milkybar Kid's.

"By . Mario Ledwith . Shoppers at the budget retailer TK Maxx may not be getting the bargains they expect. An investigation has revealed that the store’s products are often labelled with apparently misleading prices. Its success has been driven by the promise of designer items ‘always up to 60% less’. But despite its motto of ‘big labels, small prices’, price tags on some of the store’s products are often inflated to make it appear as if they were originally sold for a higher price. False promise? US department store TK Maxx boasts of big labels at low prices at its 260 UK branches . The retailer’s shelves also feature a number of products that appear to be by designer labels but are actually made by companies owned by TK Maxx. They are sold at supposedly reduced prices. The litany of seemingly misleading practices also includes allegations that some fashion brands make items to appear exclusively on the rails of the chain. The US department store is one of Britain’s most prominent high street fashion outlets, with 260 branches across the country and growth of 11 per cent last year. Even Prince Harry has been a customer. In June, he was pictured leaving TK Maxx’s store in Kensington, West London, with a bag of bargains. Royal approval: In June, Prince Harry was pictured leaving TK Maxx's store in Kensington, West London, with a bag of bargains . The thousands of products in each store are normally advertised with a recommended retail price alongside the discounted one offered. But an investigation by Channel 4’s Dispatches has discovered a number of ways the retailer manipulates this labelling to make products more appealing to customers. In a possible breach of advertising rules, several examples were found of the retailer offering products with vastly exaggerated original selling prices. A coat by the luxury fashion brand Rohmir, for example, was advertised with an RRP of £2,225, but the designer claimed the piece sold for £800. A former designer at the fashion giant Nicole Farhi also revealed how the brand would produce items at a fraction of the cost for the retailer. Nicole Farhi has since changed ownership, and the current brand owners say they have never made products for TK Maxx. Alonso Ercilla, of the Trading Standards Institute, said: ‘If you want to rely on RRP when showing some price discount, you need to be confident that RRP really existed. ‘In other words, that your competitors are using that RRP and if they’re not you shouldn’t be referring to that RRP . . . because it is clearly misleading to refer to an RRP that nobody else is using.’ TK Maxx said the RRPs on products were established after conferring with suppliers. Stores ‘only cite an RRP which has been provided . . . independently by the third-party seller’, a spokesman added. The chain said a small fraction of its products were own label and that it was ‘policy not to put RRP on own-brand products’. Any instances of original prices appearing were ‘a product of human error’. The spokesman said: ‘We work closely with Trading Standards to help us to do the right thing for our shoppers. No one is being misled.’ The own-label brands that appear in TK Maxx stores include Kenar, Arabella & Addison and Frederik Anderson of Copenhagen. Some of the brand names were tracked to an industrial estate in Watford that is the UK headquarters for the retailer’s parent firm TJX Companies.","Probe reveals products often labelled with apparently misleading prices .

"By . Mario Ledwith . When Sean Conway took to the sea, hoping to become the first person to swim the entire length of Britain, his friends told him that the challenge would kill him. Three million strokes later, and weighing a stone lighter, the weather-beaten adventurer managed to paddle across the finish line today. The 32-year-old expected to steadily creep 1,000 miles northwards over an arduous two months when he left Land’s End in Cornwall on June 30. Scroll down for video . Record: Sean Conway, 32, arriving at John O'Groats after the first ever 1,000-mile swim up Britain . Celebration: He finishes after swallowing more than 50 litres of seawater and plummeting in weight . But the warnings of his friends almost rang true, as the swimmer was forced to battle the elements over a torturous four months. He faced a string of hazards along the way, swallowing more than 50 litres of seawater, battling bouts of seasickness and experiencing severe weight loss from the physical exertion of swimming ten miles every day. The list of hazards even resulted in the swimmer growing a ‘ridiculous beard’ in a bid to deter jellyfish after being stung ten times on the face. Mr Conway, from Leckhampton, Gloucestershire, had to eat pureed food during breaks from swimming as his jaw was too cold to chew. Adventurer: The record-breaking swim is the latest of Mr Conway's adventures. He climbed Kilimanjaro dressed as a penguin and cycled 16,000 miles through six continents in 116 days with a fractured spine . Tough: Mr Conway described himself as a 'nutter' but said the experience was 'a dream come true' But arriving at John O’Groats – the British mainland’s most northerly point – the swimmer broke into tears as he sealed his place in the record books . He had spent just 90 days of the 136 swimming, with the remainder on dry land due to bad weather hampering his effort. Each time he left the water – sleeping in a yacht or onshore accommodation – his coordinates were mapped and his support boat returned to the same spot to resume the swim when it was safe to do so. Speaking after exiting the water the self-confessed ‘nutter’ described the experience as a ‘dream come true’. Vision: Zimbabwe-born Mr Conway has fantasised about reaching the harbour - staring at photos for motivation . Emerging: Crowds gathered to see the swimmer clamber out of the waves after 136 days journeying . Bad weather: Some of the days he was forced to get on dry land to recuperate during horrific storms . Sting-protection: Mr Conway 'had to grow this ridiculous beard' in the two months he was at sea . Although his feat will not be recognised by the Guinness Book of Records, due partly to him wearing a wet suit and occasionally using flippers, he does not mind. ‘I didn’t do it for the record books,’ he said yesterday. ‘I did it for different reasons – for me, and to prove it can be done, and that anybody can do anything if they put their mind to it. ‘The hardest part was trying to deal with the weather, the cold, and jellyfish in the face. I had to grow this ridiculous beard to stop the stings. ‘Guinness felt it was too difficult to attempt, and they probably did not want to be associated with it, but I have proved a lot of doubters wrong – though I’m not sorry it’s over!’ Journey: Marching out into the Cornish sea two months ago, Mr Conway did not know what he faced . Start: Setting off from Sennen Cove Bay at the start of the Speedo Swimming Britain Challenge . Exhausted: He was met at the finish by Babette, his mother, 60, who said: 'He has a strong will and mind' He was met at the finish of his ordeal by his mother Babette, 60, who said: ‘I’m so proud of him. This is his biggest adventure – he has a strong will and a strong mind.’ After tasting his first endurance event at the age of ten, when he swam a mile across a lake, the adventurer went on to climb Kilimanjaro dressed as a penguin and cycled 16,000 miles through six continents in 116 days, much of it with a fractured spine. Mr Conway, who was born in Zimbabwe, revealed that he had been fantasising about swimming into the harbour, even keeping a picture on his computer to visualise the scene. In a toast, he said: 'The hardest part was trying to deal with the weather, the cold, and jellyfish in the face' Almost conceded: 'Just a week ago I thought I might have to give up and finish next summer,' he said . Team support: Mr Conway's team embrace him as he struggles to stand on dry land . He said: ‘I’ve been dreaming of swimming into the John O’Groats harbour for a very long time. ‘I had a screengrab of the harbour on my laptop and I’ve been looking at it for ages. To finally be here and be warm and dry and on land is a good feeling. ‘Just a week ago I thought I might have to give up and finish the attempt next summer, with the bad weather, but we had a few good weather windows and I was able to finish it.’","32-year-old became first person to swim the 1,000-mile coast of Britain .

"By . Mario Ledwith . Elderly people struggling to pay soaring energy bills should only heat their living rooms in an attempt to stay warm this winter, according to the Government. Guidance also suggests that hard-pressed pensioners should only put the heating on in their bedrooms shortly before going to sleep. Furthermore, it tells elderly people to look after themselves with plenty of hot food and drinks, eating five portions of fruit and vegetables a day, and wearing plenty of layers. Cash-strapped pensioners should only put the heating on in their bedrooms shortly before going to bed (posed) The advice from Public Health England and the Department of Health is an attempt to reduce the thousands of avoidable deaths each year caused by flu and infections. The ‘Cold Weather Plan’ suggests that living rooms should be heated to temperatures of 21C (70F) and the rest of the house to 18C (65F). Public Health England said ‘too many avoidable deaths’ are recorded each winter, with  an estimated 24,000 deaths caused by cold weather in England and Wales. The Government body developed the guidance with the Department of Health, NHS England and the Local Government Association. It said the causes of death are complex, interlinked with fuel poverty, poor housing and health inequalities, also blaming ‘circulating infectious diseases, particularly flu and norovirus, and the extent of snow and ice’. Advice tells elderly people to look after themselves with plenty of hot food and drinks . As part of its advice to the public, the report says measures should be taken to reduce heat waste, such as fitting draught-proofing to seal any gaps around windows and doors. It also mentions loft insulation, keeping curtains closed to keep in heat and making sure radiators are not obstructed by furniture or curtains. The report says: ‘If you can’t heat all the rooms you use, heat the living room throughout the day and your bedroom just before you go to bed. Remember to close curtains and shut doors to keep heat in the rooms you use most.’ Despite admitting that household temperatures below those recommended in the report ‘may risk your health’, it says that higher temperatures ‘may waste money’. Dr Paul Cosford, director for health protection and medical director at PHE, said: ‘In colder weather, keeping yourself warm is essential to staying healthy, especially for the very young, older people or those with a chronic condition such as heart disease and asthma. ‘There are a range of health problems associated with cold housing and winter weather, but in particular, a cold indoor or outdoor environment can make heart and respiratory problems worse, and can be fatal. Public health minister Jane Ellison said: ‘The elderly and those with long-term illnesses are particularly at risk during the winter months so it’s crucial that people stay warm and that we all find time to check in on those who may be vulnerable. ‘Young children, older people and at-risk groups are also vulnerable to flu which is why all two and three-year-olds and those over 65 are being offered the flu vaccine. ‘It’s also vital that health services are ready to cope with the inevitable increase in pressure as temperatures drop, which is why I strongly encourage all frontline NHS staff to get their flu vaccine. ‘We are also investing £500million over the next two years to help ensure A&E departments are well prepared for winter.’","Tells elderly to look after themselves with plenty of hot food and drinks .

Having a neighbour with a drink problem wouldn’t be most people’s choice. But for benefit cheat Emilio Brunetti it proved rather rewarding. He paid alcoholic Martin Rafferty £80 a time to pose as his ailing bedbound father when council officials called in. The ruse helped him swindle more than £16,000 in benefits that were meant to fund care for his father – who was living in Brazil. The fraudster even told council officials that the man purporting to be his father was unable to speak because he had just had a brain tumour removed. When council investigators finally rumbled them, Rafferty, 62, had a ‘miracle recovery’, sat bolt upright in bed and said: ‘You got us’. A magistrate yesterday warned Brunetti that he was likely to be jailed for his ‘calculated deception’ and ‘elaborate charade’. Brunetti, 54, was granted power of attorney for his unwell father Antonio in April 2008 and started claiming housing benefit and council tax benefit in his name. He was also given a housing association flat in Fulham in his father’s name. But neighbours reported last year they had not seen Antonio and believed he was either dead or abroad. When council fraud officers visited the home for a scheduled meeting, they were greeted by Brunetti and a sleeping man in a wheelchair who he said was his father. Brunetti said that he could not wake his father because he had taken strong medication. Unconvinced, the investigators looked at CCTV footage from the front of the block of flats which showed the man claiming to be Antonio walking to his car unaided after the visit. They then arranged a second visit on February 12 this year. This time surveillance by fraud officers showed Brunetti arriving by car with an older man and walking into the property shortly before the meeting time. Imposter: Martin Rafferty was paid to pose as Brunetti's ailing father . When the three investigators joined them, Brunetti showed them a bed-bound man wearing a woolly hat who he claimed was his father. When they asked to talk to him, Brunetti said his father was unable to speak following the removal of  a brain tumour and, once again, told them he had consumed strong medication. He also claimed his father had a live-in carer but said she was visiting a GP at the time of the visit. When the investigators later returned with three officers from the Metropolitan Police and confronted the fraudsters with their surveillance, Rafferty confessed all. A source in the case said: ‘He just sat right up and said, “OK, you’ve got us” and told us who he was. He knew the game was up.’ Brunetti admitted his father had left the UK in March 2012 and that he had paid Rafferty £80 a time to pretend to be his father on numerous occasions. Antonio Brunetti has since died in Brazil. Brunetti had befriended Rafferty when he previously lived next door to him in West Kensington. He admitted four charges of fraud worth £16,400 at Hendon Magistrates’ Court. Clive Lewisohn, chairman of the bench, ordered Brunetti and Rafferty, who admitted one charge of aiding and abetting a crime, to be committed to a crown court for sentencing. He added: ‘Mr Brunetti is in a highly precarious position as far as his liberty is concerned.’ Hammersmith and Fulham Council deputy leader Greg Smith said: ‘Paying someone to pose as your dying father to cheat taxpayers is about as low as it gets.’","Emilio Brunetti paid alcoholic Martin Rafferty £80 to pose as his ailing father .

"By . Mario Ledwith . The elderly could be given state-funded cleaners so their relatives no longer have to quit their jobs to look after them. Under a plan backed by the care minister, those no longer able to carry out household tasks would be issued with vouchers to put towards gardeners, cooks and cleaners. A report claims the system, which is already used in Belgium and France, would help the economy by creating more than 700,000 jobs and stopping relatives having to leave work. A helping hand: Ministers have suggested that the elderly be given state-funded cleaners so their relatives no longer have to quit their jobs to look after them . The report, endorsed by Liberal Democrat care minister Norman Lamb, has also been backed by a coalition of academics,  charities and leading employers. The combination of Britain’s ageing population and the rising cost of care is expected to put increasing pressure on younger family members to look after their elderly relatives. And the report estimates that the exodus of experienced employees from the workplace is already costing the British economy £1.3billion every year. It says that the voucher system would take pressure off family members who are often unable to maintain their jobs while providing care for elderly relatives. A report backing the scheme has been endorsed by Liberal Democrat care minister Norman Lamb . The schemes cost billions to implement in Belgium and France, but the report argues that the subsidised employment of thousands of carers would benefit the economy. The report follows a stern warning from Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who said the UK was facing a care ‘time bomb’. He accused of employers of failing to provide more flexible working arrangements for those looking after relatives. Among those backing the report were Sainsbury’s, accountancy firm PwC and the charity Carers UK. The Daily Mail is behind a long-running campaign, Dignity for the Elderly, to ensure a better deal for Britain’s ageing population. The report concludes: ‘While recognising that in the current ﬁnancial climate it may be challenging to apply some of these approaches, the group believes that there are some useful learning points from these overseas examples. It therefore wishes to consider alternative, more targeted interventions with the potential to unlock similar outcomes. ‘[It] recommends that the  Government works with selected local authorities in different areas to investigate alternative methods for supporting carers to remain in work, and for developing the care and support market more generally. ‘Investment now may lead to a ﬁnancial proﬁt as well as creating huge social and health value.’ Madeleine Starr, the director of innovation at Carers UK, said: ‘Government must urgently examine how to cultivate good quality, affordable care services for older people who don’t qualify for local council social care services which are increasingly being rationed to only those with little or no savings and the highest levels of need.’","The system is .

"By . Mario Ledwith . American feel: Author Jhumpa Lahiri, who has been nominated for this year's Booker prize for her novel The Lowland, was born in London but now lives in New York . American authors will be allowed to compete for Britain’s most prestigious writing prize for the first time next year. The decision to open the Man Booker to US writers has prompted a raft of criticism from the literary world, with many fearing the move will prevent fledgling British authors from gaining recognition. The prize is currently only open to writers from the Commonwealth,  Ireland and Zimbabwe. But it is understood that organisers of the award – which has catapulted the careers of some of Britain’s leading authors – believe that excluding American authors limits the Booker’s global significance. This year’s shortlist, announced last week, has already raised eyebrows for its distinctly American feel. Four already live and work in the US, including Jhumpa Lahiri, 46, shortlisted for her novel The Lowland. Born in London and of Indian origin, she was raised in Rhode Island and now lives in New York. Another who is already widely considered American is US-born Ruth Ozeki, a 57-year-old Buddhist priest who also holds a Canadian passport. Broadcaster and author Melvyn Bragg was among those from the literary world who has criticised the proposal. Mr Bragg said: ‘I’m disappointed… though not that  surprised. The Booker will now lose its distinctiveness. ‘It’s rather like a British company being taken over by some worldwide conglomerate.’ Jim Crace, the British author whose novel Harvest is favourite to win this year’s award, claimed the move would make the Booker ‘lose a focus’. He said: ‘In principle, I should believe in all prizes being open to everyone. ‘But I think prizes need to have their own characters, and sometimes those characters are defined by their limitations. ‘If you open the Booker prize to all people writing in the  English language, it would be a fantastic overview of English language literature but it would lose a focus. ‘I’m very fond of the sense of the Commonwealth. There’s something in there that you would lose if you open it up to American authors.’ Another British author,  Stuart Evers, wrote on Twitter that such a change would have a ‘massively detrimental effect on British and Commonwealth literary fiction’. Coconut Unlimited author Nikesh Shukla wrote: ‘I  think writers at my level will get crowded out of the market.’ A spokesman for the award declined to comment yesterday but said that changes are due to be announced in the near-future. This year’s winner of the prize, founded in 1969, will be announced on October 15. Last year’s winner was Hilary Mantel, the first woman to win the Booker twice.

ITV was today forced to defend its latest episode of Downton Abbey after viewers were left ‘distressed and disgusted’ when one of the drama's best-loved characters was beaten up and raped. At least thirty people have complained to TV watchdog Ofcom about the violent scene involving housemaid Anna Bates, with some accusing writers of using a sexual assault to 'spice up' the show. Others watching last night said that the decision to feature violence against women as a key plotline was ‘morally reprehensible’. But ITV said a message was played before the show aired warning it contained ‘violent scenes that some viewers may find upsetting’, while Downton's makers said it was 'acted and directed with great sensitivity'.

"By . Chris Wheeler . Follow @@ChrisWheelerDM . Stevan Jovetic has vowed to make an impact at Manchester City this season and silence the critics who claim his £22million move from Fiorentina last summer was a waste of money. Jovetic, 24, made only two Premier League starts due to a succession of niggling injuries that frustrated his new club and manager Manuel Pellegrini. There were even suggestions the gifted Montenegro forward’s issues might be psychological rather than physical or that he was suffering from homesickness.

Finisher: Jovetic scored twice as Man City beat AC Milan 5-1 on Sunday . VIDEO Pellegrini delighted at rampant City . But after playing his second game on tour and scoring twice in City’s 5-1 demolition of AC Milan in Pittsburgh on Sunday, Jovetic insisted that was not the case and promised to repay Pellegrini’s faith. ‘No it wasn’t mental,’ he said. ‘Mentally I don’t know where I was, but the most important thing in football is the head. There are so many good players but your head has to be right. ‘In that moment, people were saying “Jovetic is not good and they paid £20m” but I was quiet, I kept working and I knew I would show what I was capable of. If you want a good player you have to pay for them. ‘I wasn’t happy, that was obvious. I didn’t play. But I never said it was better to leave England. I know I’m good, I know I can play there. It was difficult but in that moment you just have to believe in yourself. ‘I spoke with the manager a bit about that when we came back. I have his confidence and I’m going to do everything I can to repay that and show I deserve to play.’ Despite a lack of match action last season, Jovetic still demonstrated his potential by scoring six goals in 18 appearances in all competitions. With Alvaro Negredo ruled out for up to . two months with a broken bone in his foot and Sergio Aguero struggling . for fitness after the World Cup, City will be relying on Jovetic for . goals when they kick off the new campaign against Arsenal in the .

The former Partizan Belgrade star is ready for the challenge this time, blaming last season’s setbacks on the fact that his protracted move to England meant that he did not have a proper pre-season. ‘The problem was that the club had finished with the first part of pre-season in South Africa and I was waiting to sign,’ said Jovetic, who is set to face Liverpool at Yankee Stadium tomorrow (wed). ‘I was working alone but it’s not the same. ‘When I arrived they were starting to play matches and I was always behind the rest of the squad. Then I had one injury after another. ‘In the last few months of the season, when I was fit, I played well every game. I came on for 30 or 45 minutes, some games I started.

"By . Ryan Gorman . The FBI is investigating a ‘military-style’ attack on a California electric power facility earlier this year. The April 16 attack saw as many as two gunmen storm the PG&E Metcalf substation after severing phone service and fire several dozen rounds at transformers. Federal officials took over the investigation from local law enforcement on fears it was linked to the Boston marathon bombing only a day earlier, but those fears appear to have subsided. At least one person, maybe two, went down multiple manholes at the facility in a San Jose suburb and cut fiber cables leading to the substation, according to Foreign Policy, which detailed the well-planned attack. Attacked: The FBI is investigating an April attack on PG&E's Metcalf substation. Experts have warned the assault could have been a 'dress rehearsal for a larger attack' This knocked out 911 and landline service o the substation, as well as cell phone service to the surrounding area. PG&E employees had no means to call for help when, at 1am, as many as two gunmen began their attack. More than 100 rounds were fired from high-powered rifles at many transformers – 10 were damaged in one area and three transformer banks in another, a PG&E spokesperson told the site. Cooling oil leaking from at least one transformer bank caused transformers to overheat and shut down. This led officials to warn locals to conserve energy, but no major power outages occurred. No major damage or injuries were sustained either, but a stalled local investigation led the feds to take over the case. Cables cut: At least one suspect cut communications cables along this highway and another before shooting up the substation . No major damage: Transformers were shot at over 100 times, but no serious damage was sustained, nor was anyone injured . ‘Initially, the attack was being treated as vandalism and handled by local law enforcement,’ a senior intelligence official told Foreign Policy. ‘However, investigators have been quoted in the press expressing opinions that there are indications that the timing of the attacks and target selection indicate a higher level of planning and sophistication,’ the official explained. The FBI was initially worried that the attack was somehow linked to the April 15 Boston Marathon bombing, but further investigation showed it to likely be an isolated local event, an agency spokesperson told Foreign Policy. A PG&E official disagreed with that . assertion, and told Foreign Policy the attack was ‘not amateurs taking . potshots… this was a dress rehearsal.’ Lit up: The Santa Clara Sheriff's Office released this surveillance footage of the attack which shows the gunshots going off on the grounds of the PG&E facility . Sparks flew: No one was injured and the power didn't actually go out in the area because the state grid was able to maintain it but officials fear that it was a test run . The agency is following a couple of leads, but has yet to name any suspects. No one has claimed responsibility. The FBI is also investigating a series of attacks on the Arkansas power grid where multiple high-voltage transmission lines were severed and one substation was set on fire, according to the New York Times. ‘You should have expected U.S.’ was scribbled on a control panel at the torched substation. There is no indication the attacks in Arkansas and California are related.","As many as two attackers cut all phone service - both landline and cellular - to PG&E's Metcalf substation .

"By . Mario Ledwith . Women bosses lack humour and personality in the workplace compared with their male counterparts because they feel ‘pressure to be superhuman’, according to a leading businesswoman. Nicky Dulieu, chief executive of fashion chain Hobbs, also claimed that women at the helm of major companies ‘need more conﬁdence’ and tend to hide their personalities. Her remarks follow a survey by the company that found more than a third of women preferred to work for a man. Nicky Dulieu claimed that women at the helm of major companies 'need more confidence' and tend to hide their personalities . The survey of more than 2,500 adults found that only ten per cent of women preferred having a woman manager, with 34 per cent saying that they would rather work for a man. Miss Dulieu, 49, claimed a typical female employee has a ‘tendency to look to men as her preferred leader’ and suggested women need more support to establish themselves within businesses. Deference to senior males means women in management often hide their own personalities, she said. ‘We hide our natural personalities, and need more conﬁdence. When I realised that being 'me' wasn’t a bad thing in business – that I’m not the toughest or always right – it was a good thing for me', she said. ‘There is so much pressure on women to be superhuman, they have no personality in the process.’ Royal fashion: The Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middleton, left, and her sister Pippa, both seen wearing Hobbs dresses during outings, are fans of the fashion store . She added: ‘It is clear women need . more support in building not only with their own confidence in the . workplace, but also confidence in one another. ‘This . seems particularly important in the early years of a woman’s career . when she appears to have a tendency to look to men as her preferred . leader.’ Miss Dulieu, who started at Marks & Spencer as a trainee accounts clerk, went on to become an executive at the company. The . daughter of a toolmaker and a hairdresser, who grew up in Chingford, . North East London, she joined Hobbs in 2008 and has seen the company . surge in popularity. Kate and Pippa Middleton are among its biggest fans and have been frequently seen wearing the label. But, describing her insecurity upon first joining, Miss Dulieu said  she felt like an ‘imposter’ and expected somebody to ‘expose’ her lack of expertise. ‘You’re waiting to ﬁnd out you’re not as good as you think you are,’ she said. Calling for more women role models, she added: ‘Women need to support each other more; have a  network you can trust and where you can share those insecurities.’ ‘I also think it’s about identifying women who do inﬂuence the rest of their teams and making sure that they understand the right, natural way of doing it: being themselves.’ Nicky Dulieu, the daughter of a toolmaker and a hairdresser, who grew up in Chingford, North East London, joined Hobbs in 2008 . Miss Dulieu has previously spoken about donning her jeans and wellies at weekends as escapism from her busy life in the boardroom. She once said: ‘That’s where my creativity comes out. I’m what you would call a cottage gardener.’ Hobbs, which has a male chairman and an all-female board, commissioned the research to gain an insight into working women who work in the store. The survey found that women aged between 25 and 34 were most likely to prefer a male boss. It found men preferred working for management of the same sex, with more than a quarter of male employees saying they preferred a male boss and only eight per cent saying they would rather work for a woman. However, and perhaps most inspiring for businesswomen looking to ascend to the boardroom, overall 61 per cent of respondents said they did not care about the sex of their boss. The only age bracket which preferred to work for a woman boss was also the youngest – aged between 18 and 24. Despite the overall preference for male bosses, the survey found that women scored highest in four areas – good communication, listening and organisation skills – deemed essential for a leader. Male bosses were described as more inspiring, logical and having a better sense of humour.","Nicky Dulieu, 49 started career as a trainee clerk at Marks & Spencer .

"By . Chris Wheeler . Follow @@ChrisWheelerDM . When Luiz Felipe Scolari chooses the man to fill Neymar’s golden boots in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday, he knows it is a decision that could shape Brazil’s World Cup destiny. No-one can properly replace Neymar. Scolari is aware of that and so are his players. From the moment the mercurial star was carried off with a fractured vertebrae in Fortaleza on Friday, the victim of a crude Colombian knee in the back, the host nation feared that their dreams may have disappeared with him. Brazil have no choice but to try and pick themselves up for Tuesday’s World Cup semi-final against Germany at the Estadio Mineirao, while Scolari must pick the right man to take Neymar’s place. It’s a huge call. Crocked: Neymar lies motionless on the turf after breaking a vertebrae against Colombia . Decision time: 'Big Phil' Scolari must choose between Willian and Bernard to replace his No 10 . The task is likely to fall to one of two players. In the diminutive Bernard, Scolari has the nearest like-for-like replacement for Neymar; a nimble, tricky forward capable of producing a piece of magic that could stop the German machine in its tracks. In Chelsea’s Willian, the Brazil coach possesses a more reliable option and one he seems more likely to take. Whichever choice Scolari makes will offer an insight into his thinking. Take the game to Germany or dig in. Without Neymar to light up a rather ordinary Brazil team, you suspect he will go for the latter. Willian is a conscientious and disciplined midfielder who has shown during his first season under Jose Mourinho at Chelsea that he is prepared to sacrifice himself for the greater good of the team. He will keep possession, make his tackles and track back to protect his defence – all qualities that will be sorely needed against a ruthless German side. In short, he has more to offer than Bernard though without that spark of genius. Functional: Willian is known for his willingness to track back and defend from wide . He also has a good understanding with his Chelsea team-mate Oscar, who could occupy Neymar’s withdrawn role and interchange with Willian who usually starts on the right-hand side. ‘We played a lot together last season at Chelsea,’ said Willian. ‘We were free to move around and we are very familiar with each other’s games. If Scolari does choose me, it won’t be a problem for us because we have had a year of playing together.’ For the 25-year-old, the return to Belo Horizonte represents an opportunity he feared may have disappeared when he missed a penalty in the shootout there against Chile after coming on as a substitute in extra-time. Willian’s other two appearances in the tournament have been off the bench against Mexico and Cameroon, replacing Neymar on the second occasion. However he insists that it is pointless drawing comparisons. Creative spark: Bernard has the potential to be a match winner for Brazil . ‘There’s no comparing us. We have different styles. Yes, some things are similar, such as our speed and dribbling, but Neymar is a striker whereas I am more a midfielder who sets up others. Neymar scores a lot of goals, whereas I am more someone who serves my team-mates. ‘Neymar sets the standard for us. He is capable of deciding any game, so playing without him will be difficult.’ For the man who replaced Willian at Shakhtar Donetsk last summer, a semi-final appearance would be even more emotional. Bernard was born and raised in Belo Horizonte and played for Atletico Mineiro until his £21.5million move to Ukraine. The local hero will become a national icon if he can help steer Brazil into the World Cup final. At 5ft 5in, you fear that Bernard is in danger of being crushed by his German opponents. He offers none of the efficiency, defensive solidity or tactical reliability of Willian. Key role: Chelsea midfielders Oscar (left) is likely to be moved central in Neymar's absence . Yet the man described by Scolari as having ‘joy in his legs’ might also be Brazil’s ace in the pack; a player capable of producing a moment of magic, something out of nothing, just like the talisman they have lost to injury. The question is, can Brazil afford to gamble? So far the 21-year-old’s contribution has been limited – a half-time substitute against Mexico and a second-half appearance off the bench against Croatia – but he is ready if needed. ‘We have to be prepared,’ said Bernard. ‘We are all very sad (about Neymar) but we have to overcome it. This is a World Cup semi-final and the players have to be prepared, psychologically and emotionally. We have lots of other good players and we can still beat Germany and be the champions.’ To do so, Brazil will have to raise their game another level without Neymar. Willian or Bernard must fill those golden boots, and now it’s down to Scolari to decide. For Big Phil, it’s a hell of a big call.

"By . Mario Ledwith . Former adviser to Tony Blair and current Save The Children chief executive was among nine at the charity awarded £160,000 in bonuses . Executives at one of the UK’s most prominent international aid charities were handed bonuses worth more than £160,000 last year. Save the Children increased performance-related pay to executives by a third compared to the previous year, a move that could prove controversial following criticism of the huge pay-packets enjoyed by charity bosses. The charity’s chief executive Justin Forsyth, a former advisor to Tony Blair, was among nine Save the Children executives handed the bonus in 2012. It was revealed earlier this week that Mr Forsyth earned a salary of £163,000, which is now known to include £22,560 in performance-related pay. He is one of six staff at the 14 charities which make up the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) that earn more than the Prime Minister’s £142,500 salary. The revelation prompted the International Development Secretary Justine Greening to say that the finances of major aid organisations - which receive hundreds of millions of pounds from taxpayers - must be open to scrutiny. William Shawcross, the chairman of the Charity Commission, also said that ‘disproportionate’ salaries in the face of decreasing charitable donations from the public risked ‘bringing the charitable world into disrepute’. Save the Children paid its executives £120,000 in performance-related pay in 2011 but said that Mr Forsyth declined the money due to being ‘relatively new’ in his role. The payments increased significantly to £162,000 last year after the company ‘restructured’ the way it offered bonuses. The charity said the payments encouraged the ‘very best’ from staff and helped to ‘save the lives of more of the world’s poorest children’. Three staff at Save the Children earn more than £140,000. The highest is chief operating officer Annabel Hoult who earned £168,653 last year. The revelation prompted Conservative MP Charlie Elphicke to describe the bonuses as ‘inappropriate and objectionable’. Outspoken: Justine Greening said that the finances of major aid organisations - which receive hundreds of millions of pounds from taxpayers - must be open to scrutiny . The public administration select committee member told the Daily Telegraph: ‘Out-of-control salaries for charities risk bringing the voluntary sector into disrepute. ‘Volunteers who are paid nothing will rightly ask why charities are paying bonuses like they are some kind of bank or big multinational.’ A spokesman for Save the Children said: ‘Save the Children does not run a bonus pool for its senior executives. Instead, all staff pay increases are related to performance, and the salaries of our executive directors contain a performance related element. ‘Last year, we restructured the way we allocate this performance related pay, standardising it across the executive directors after taking advice from an expert remuneration agency, Towers Watson. ‘Save the Children does not run a bonus . pool for its senior executives. Instead, all staff pay increases are . related to performance, and the salaries of our executive directors . contain a performance related element.' Save The Children spokesman . ‘Nine members of staff are covered by executive directors performance related pay. The performance related portions of directors salaries totalled approximately £120,000 in 2011. ‘In 2011, Justin chose not to take the performance related portion of is salary, as he was relatively new as CEO.’ The spokesman said that 20 per cent of executive’s salaries are performance related and are determined by 20 performance indicators. The DEC, which brings together aid organisations to raise money quickly for the victims of natural disasters, has been singled out for particular criticism as high earners do not need to be identified in its annual accounts. Charities working for the fund rely on public funds, having received more than £1.1billion over the past three years from the Government, the United Nations and the EU. The top salary of £184,000 was given to British Red Cross chief executive Sir Nick Young, who is a former city lawyer. There are 186 staff earning over £60,000 - a 16 per cent rise in three years, while the number on six figure salaries has risen from 22 in 2010 to 30 last year.","Charity Chief Executive Justin Forsyth earned £163,000 last year .

His result was his highest finish in a Grand Tour, while last year he helped Chris Froome clinch Team Sky's second yellow jersey in two years in France.

For the 47-year-old has applied to trademark his name for an array of products, including baseball hats, travel mugs – even underwear – as he attempts to join the celebrity chef elite. Joining the celebrity chef elite: Paul Hollywood has applied to trademark his name on a variety of products including cooking equipment and underwear . Despite his high-profile split with his wife Alexandra earlier this year, the application lodged last month suggests Hollywood is seeking to take advantage of his television profile. The trademark was made through his company Paul Hollywood Limited. Hollywood has already sought to capitalise on the popularity of the BBC2 programme and was given a spin-off, Paul Hollywood’s Bread, by the corporation. His personal website was also relaunched last week, selling his two cookery books, How To Bake and the accompanying book to his BBC2 show. Before the split: Paul Hollywood, Chef and wife Alexandra Hollywood at the 'Skyfall' Royal World Film Premiere After Party, London . If the application is successful his . name will be protected should he wish to use it on freezers and kettles. A range of clothing is covered by the application, including waistcoats . and footwear. Hollywood has sought trademark protection under nine classes, including fan clubs, barbecues and computer programs. Ancient Hume Limited, a brand protection company which represents Mr Hollywood, and Yellow Poppy, his agency, did not comment. In a high-profile split, the celebrity baker left his wife of 15 years in March and was later rumoured to have started a relationship with  his 35-year-old co-host Marcela Valladolid on the American version of the bakery competition. Hollywood’s estranged wife Alexandra later revealed that she is divorcing him on the grounds of his adultery, which he is not contesting. She said: ‘I felt very secure with Paul. I trusted him completely. I loved him and he loved me. We were happy and life was good. ‘I love my husband and I was and still am very proud of what he has achieved, but there is no going back and I just want this finished with and to move on. ‘I don’t know if he still loves me.

"By . Laura Williamson . Follow @@laura_mail . The Commonwealth Games have been rocked by a second failed drugs test ahead of the start of the athletics on Saturday. European 400 metres hurdles champion and Wales co-captain Rhys Williams, son of Wales and Lions rugby legend JJ Williams, was kicked out of the Games after  failing a drugs test at the Glasgow Grand Prix on July 11. It is the second shock for the Wales team after 800m runner Gareth Warburton also lost his place last week after testing  positive for a banned substance. Shock: Wales co-captain Rhys Williams has been suspended from the Games for a failed drugs test . Like Warburton, Williams insisted he had ‘not knowingly taken any banned substance’ and has requested a full hearing before the National Anti-Doping Panel, though this is not likely to take place until September. In the meantime, both athletes will be banned from track and field. Williams, 30, said: ‘I am utterly devastated about the news of this anti-doping rule violation, which has come as a great shock to me. From the outset, I would strongly like to state that I have not  knowingly taken any banned substance. ‘To be named co-team captain for the Welsh Athletics Team was a great honour and I am distraught that I won’t be able to fulfil this role and join them as part of Team Wales. ‘As a professional athlete, I have always supported and have been an advocate of clean sport. However, I recognise that the responsibility for this situation lies with me and I’m committed to working with UK Anti-Doping and will fully co-operate in the legal process.’ Enter the dragons: Rhys Williams poses with his father, the legendary Wales rugby player JJ Williams (L) Williams’ statement was remarkably similar to the one released on Warburton’s behalf  last week. The pair share  the same management  company and also sometimes use the same range of supplements, provided by a company called Mountain Fuel. It is understood Williams began using four supplements — which come in sachet form and are then mixed with milk or water — at the start of 2014, with Warburton  following suit a month later. One  of the products common to both  is called Night Fuel, a chocolate- tasting drink high in protein. No Mountain Fuel supplements are, however, listed on the Informed-Sport website, either in the list of registered or batch-tested products. Athletes are urged to cross-check this website for accredited supplements that should be safe and legal for them to use, though the site does not offer a 100 per cent guarantee. A spokesman for Mountain Fuel confirmed  yesterday that ‘an internal and external investigation is going on to find out what has happened’. The 400m hurdler has requested a hearing after insisting he never knowingly took a banned substance . The company are expecting  test results back early next week but are confident no substances deemed illegal under the World Anti-Doping Agency code will be found in their products. Welsh Athletics officials admitted ‘obvious concern’ that its previously unblemished anti-doping record has been breached for the second time in nine days and announced it had launched an ‘internal review’. Matt Newman, chief executive of Welsh Athletics, said Williams’ ‘B’ sample was tested on Thursday and matched the ‘A’ sample. As in Warburton’s case, the exact nature of the banned substance involved has yet to be disclosed, but Newman said the two failed tests were ‘not a coincidence’. He added: ‘There are common factors in the two situations. The fact there have been two cases in a short space of time mean it’s not a coincidence. But at this stage we just hope we can back up what the athletes suspect is the source of the contamination.’ Double trouble: Rhys Williams was the second Welshman to be thrown out of the Games after Gareth Warburton . All home nation athletes due to compete at the Games have had to take part in an anti-doping education programme, which specifically stresses the importance of double-checking the legality of supplements using the Informed-Sport website. Williams, who won a bronze medal four years ago in Delhi, had been due to compete in the 400m hurdles alongside former training partner and defending Commonwealth champion, Dai Greene, a staunch and often outspoken anti-doping advocate. The pair were once both part of a well-renowned training group working under Malcolm Arnold, who coached Colin Jackson to the 1993 world 110m hurdles title and a world record. Williams, however, left in 2010 to work with Dan Pfaff and, currently, Adrian Thomas. The Welsh have already been hit by the withdrawal of cyclist Becky James and triathletes Non Stanford and Helen Jenkins through injury, all of whom would have been tipped to win medals. Missed: Rhys Williams won gold at the 2012 European Athletics Championships in Helsinki, Finland . Boxer Fred Evans was refused accreditation, ostensibly owing to his conviction for assault in April, and now two members of the  athletics team have failed drugs tests. Williams’ ban is also a further blow to the credibility of the  athletics competition, usually one of the marquee sports at the Games. With fans already disappointed by the timing of Mo Farah’s decision to pull out, and Usain Bolt opting only to run in the 4x100m relay next weekend, the sport has now been plunged into another drugs storm. The issue has already marred much of the early season, with high profile sprinters Tyson Gay and Asafa Powell returning to the sport after serving drugs bans to face Justin Gatlin. American Gatlin is the fastest man in the world this year, yet served a four-year ban  following his second anti-doping offence in 2006. 1984: Born February 27 in Cardiff, Wales. His father is former Wales rugby union international JJ Williams. 2005: Takes 400 metres hurdles gold at the AAA Under-23 Championships. 2006: Finishes fourth on his Commonwealth Games debut, as well as taking bronze at the European Championships.

Seven years ago Steve Way had high blood pressure, smoked 20 cigarettes a day and weighed 16-and-a-half-stone after gorging on takeaway curries and chocolate. On Saturday morning he will represent England in the marathon at the Commonwealth Games. Way, who now weighs just 10st 8lbs, will not just be running to make up the numbers, either. Going the distance: Steve Way will represent England in the marathon at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow . The 40-year-old was the third British man home in this year’s London Marathon, crossing the line in 15th place, just eight minutes behind Mo Farah, to earn his place at these Games. Not bad considering he had slept in a camper van on his cousin’s drive the night before to save money. Way, who works full-time in a bank in Bournemouth, found himself shepherded towards the recovery area in London with the elite athletes after earning his largest cash prize to date, £896. He had to politely explain to stewards that his kit was with the mass participants. Turnaround: Steve Way was overweight and unhealthy before he changed his life through running . His next target is to shave another 45 seconds off his personal best and break Ron Hill’s 1979 British record of 2hours 15.46secs, for runners aged 40 or over. It has been a quite extraordinary turnaround for a ‘fat bloke’ who decided to run the 2006 London Marathon ‘on a whim’ and ended up beating many younger, thinner, fitter club runners by clocking 3hrs 7mins 8secs. Fighting fit: Steve Way now runs 130 miles per week . Such an impressive time did not prompt Way to take up running properly. It was only 18 months later that he realised he needed to: not with any ambitions of joining the elite but for the good of his health. ‘Towards the end of 2007 I could hardly sleep,’ he told The Guardian. ‘I was coughing and waking up because of the smoking and it was impacting on my wife Sarah, too. ‘At that point half our meals were takeaways and I would eat chocolate and sweets all the time. I realised I had to do something radically different to break the cycle.’ Way trained for the 2008 London Marathon for 24 weeks, finished in 2hrs 35mins and changed his lifestyle completely. He now runs around 130 miles a week — averaging 11 miles a day for the past seven years — and believes he could win gold in the 100km (62-mile) World Championships in Doha in November if he can clock under 6hrs 20mins. He is a self-confessed ‘running nerd’ but still struggles to define himself as an elite athlete. There is clearly still disbelief that he found himself posing for pictures with Sir Bradley Wiggins in the athletes’ village in Glasgow and ‘casually ‘‘hanging out’’ with the guys I’m normally watching on the Diamond League circuit — even though I’m old enough to be most of their dads!’. Whatever happens during those 26.2miles around Glasgow tomorrow, Way has certainly earned a celebratory takeaway, that’s for sure.","Steve Way will race for England in the marathon at Glasgow 2014 .

He won silver in Delhi four years ago, silver at the world short-course championships in 2012 and silver at the London Olympics. It is now ‘time to step up’, in his home town at his home Games. Jamieson wants gold. ‘I was always a bit wary of saying “I want to win gold” because I didn’t want to jinx it,’ he said. ‘But everyone knows that’s the result I want. This is the biggest event of my life. I feel like it’s not just for me, it’s for everybody. VIDEO Scroll down for Glasgow ready for 2014 Commonwealths .

We’re looking to win more medals than we have ever done, so I want to play my part in that.’ Expectation will be pressing down on Jamieson’s powerful shoulders as he dives into that pool. He has been training 30 hours a week for more than a decade, rising at 5.45am, practising until 10am, feeding up and then doing it all again from 2pm until 6pm. He is also the poster boy for these Games and the timetable has been designed so he can, hopefully, get Scotland off to a winning start. To his credit, Jamieson has embraced the hype and the swimmer has been talking to a sports psychologist to try to ensure he enjoys the experience, as well as achieving success. No pressure: Jamieson opens proceedings for Scotland and will want a winning start . ‘The first time I had a taste of sports psychology was in the lead-in to London,’ he says. ‘I wanted to walk out for the final and just be relaxed. Now I know how to do that and the goal for me is getting the balance between enjoying the event — because it’s my home Games in my home town — and not putting too much pressure on myself. ‘But that’s the lifestyle and I love it. I train to compete at events like the Commonwealth Games, so I’m so eager to make the most of it.’ Pedigree: Jamieson won silver for Team GB at the 2012 Olympics in London . Jamieson has been ‘flogging’ himself to ensure he arrives in Glasgow in the form of his life. He loves that aspect of his sport, but trying to push his body to its limits led to a heart scare late last year. He ‘felt funny’ during a weights session, but warmed up to swim anyway, dived in and then realised his heart-rate was through the roof. He was admitted to hospital with an irregular heartbeat. ‘They slow your heart-rate down and give you a bit of an electric shock and that re-sets it,’ he explains. Jamieson describes this process very casually. He is wary of it being seen as an excuse for potential failure. He insists he does not feel any after-effects, but he knows the problem could have ended his career. ‘It was a strange situation,’ he says. ‘At 25, you don’t expect to have heart problems — you’re supposed to be in the shape of your life. I was pretty calm, but I had a 10-minute period where I had a bit of a panic. ‘I was in the main theatre room and the doctor said, “There’s a 48-hour window where, if a patient displays the same symptoms, we can treat it. Outside that it becomes a bit more complicated and you might have to step away from swimming”. ‘That made me think, “I’ve got to make the most of this”. There is nothing to be worried about, but I can’t explain why it happened the first time and, if it happened again, I don’t think I’d be able to keep swimming. ‘It made me take stock and think I have to make the most of it.’ It is a thought that is driving on .

So I thought I’d put all my eggs into the one I’m going to try and do for the next two years.’ He has won three Commonwealth silver medals but never a gold. ‘I’m a lot stronger than I used to be in the event, which is one of the things the road has given me,’ said Sir Bradley. ‘The initial thing, having been away for so long, was whether I could still do it, and the signs were really good.’ Sir Bradley is tied with Sir Chris Hoy as Britain’s most decorated Olympian, with seven medals, and will race at a velodrome named after the Scot. ‘I’d be a bit p****d off if I were him,’ said Sir Bradley. ‘They’ve stuck a great big Emirates sign over his name and it doesn’t stand out that it’s the Sir Chris Hoy velodrome. Stick a whopping great statue outside. He won’t complain because he’s far too nice. So I’ll complain for him.’ Up and running: Sir Bradley mounts the bike during a practise session .

"By . Laura Williamson . Follow @@laura_mail . A white tent next to a bowling green at the Belvidere Bowling Club near Celtic Park, with police snipers bearing down from the rooftops of neighbouring high-rise flats, was not perhaps the most fitting welcome to Glasgow for a knight of the realm. But it didn’t seem to bother Sir Bradley Wiggins. ‘No-one calls me that anyway,’ he said. ‘No-one. Only Sir Dave.’ He meant Sir David Brailsford, the former director of British Cycling and now principal of Team Sky: also known as the man who left Wiggins out of Sky’s team for this year’s Tour de France. No wonder Wiggins’ voice was dripping with sarcasm. Representing: Sir Bradley Wiggins will be riding for England at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow . In practice: Wiggins during a training session at the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome in Glasgow . ‘F***ing Chris Froome,’ was his opening gambit, delivered strictly tongue-in-cheek and with a cheeky smile as he took off his rockstar sunglasses to speak to the assembled press. He was bang on time, interesting and engaging. Most unlike your average sportsman, in fact. We had, however, already been politely told that all Tour de France questions were strictly off the menu. Wiggins is here in Glasgow to concentrate on other things, after all. His primary focus has now switched back to the track: first the 4,000 metres of the team pursuit on Thursday, the only event he will contest in Glasgow, and then his attempt to win his fifth Olympic gold medal in Rio de Janeiro in two years’ time. Another Olympic title would take his overall medal tally to eight; one ahead of Sir Chris Hoy, who won six golds and a silver medal during his career. The 34-year-old had plenty to say about his fellow cycling knight, mind you; primarily about the arena which bears Sir Chris’ name and in which Wiggins will race this week. ‘It is a bit odd,’ he said. ‘I’d be a bit p***** off if I were him because they’ve stuck a great big Emirates sign over his name and it doesn’t stand out that it’s the Sir Chris Hoy velodrome other than a little thing as you walk in. It’s more like a shopping sign with an Emirates thing on it. ‘I think there should be more made for him. Stick a whopping great statue outside because it doesn’t hit you straight away that it’s his velodrome. I think he got done over a bit. ‘But he won’t complain because he’s far too nice. So I’ll complain for him. They should do something about it.’ Ambassador: Despite not competing in it, Sir Chris Hoy is one of the faces of the Commonwealth Games . The Real McCoy: The legend won six Olympic golds in his career, including two at London 2012 . Sir Brad had spoken, but there was little of the stoic elder statesman about an athlete who seemed to have rediscovered his love for the track he left six years ago to concentrate on road racing. He spoke of feeling refreshed and excited to be back in an environment that began when he won the three-kilometre individual pursuit at the world junior championship in 1998 and then silver in the team pursuit at the Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpar later that year. He said: ‘Especially having not been selected for the Tour, the track was kind of like the perfect distraction. ‘The road’s so different. It’s not enjoyable the road, in some ways. You go there and there’s so much pressure on you because of who you are within road cycling. ‘Everyone’s watching you all the time, whereas you can go into the track and have off days and no-one really sees. ‘I remember finding out I wasn’t doing the Tour. Then it was like: “Monday morning I was hitting the track.” It was like going back 15 years: the excitement of building my bike up again and getting back on the track for the first time. It was really refreshing actually, just enjoyable. ‘I felt back in with the boys and they didn’t really care who you were. It was kind of like I had been away for the school holidays and come back to a new year and there new kids starting and everything. ‘I’m a lot stronger than I used to be in the event, which is one of the things the road has given me. Hopefully that will continue for the next two years.’ Rivalry: The past two Tour de France winners Sir Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome . More success: Wiggins is hoping to add to his previous Olympic triumphs, with gold at London 2012 one of his seven medals . Glasgow may only be a stepping stone in Wiggins’ bid to become the most decorated British Olympian in history, but this competition clearly means something to him. He has won three silver medals but never a gold, and was enthused yesteday about the competitiveness of the track cycling. England will face tough opposition from Australia and New Zealand in particular. ‘The Commonwealth Games is a fantastic event in its own right,’ said Wiggins. ‘Going up against Australia or New Zealand, it could be an Olympic final or world final. ‘Being part of it all at 18 in Kuala Lumpar was like being at the Olympics. I was in the Village with the likes of Steve Backley, Iwan Thomas and all those types of people. ‘At the time it was massive. I guess that was the warm-up to the Olympics two years later and that inspired me to move on.’ The famous sideburns may have gone, so too the yellow jersey, but Wiggins’ star quality remains.

"By . Laura Williamson . Australian sport will show it is on its way back at the Commonwealth Games after a disastrous showing at London 2012, Olympic 100m hurdles champion Sally Pearson has warned. Australia could only finish a lowly 10th - seven places below Great Britain-  in the medals table at the last Olympics as Pearson won one of the mere seven golds her country took back home. The green and gold of Australia has, however, topped every medals table at the Commonwealths since 1986, when Scotland last hosted the Games. Star: Sally Pearson won gold in the 100m hurdles at the 2012 London Olympics for Australia . Comeback: Pearson insists that Australian sport is on the up and they can top the medal table in Glasgow .

Don't forget that at the 2012 Olympics, Australia won just seven golds... the same number as Yorkshire! Steve Moneghetti, Australia’s chef de mission, has admitted his country will ‘have our work cut out just to win the medal tally, let alone dominate it’ but Pearson, the athletics team captain, believes we will see the signs of her country’s new generation of talent in Glasgow. Pearson said: ‘Don’t tell me (about London 2012)! It was the best time of my life but it was terrible (for Australia). 'But we have a good team this year: 103 in athletics, a lot of young and younger athletes coming through. It’s going to be a good Games, and we always have the swimmers - our saving grace. ‘A lot of our top athletes (in track and field) retired after the Sydney Olympics so it was like a whole new generation to build up through to Beijing in 2008 and on to London. Lone champion: Pearson's gold was one of just seven for Australia but she thinks Glasgow will be different . ‘It has been a huge building (process), 14 years, to try to find new athletes and to develop them. But finally now we have a good crop of juniors coming through, especially because the Commonwealth Games in 2018 are on the Gold Coast.’ Other Olympic champions have opted to skip the competition, or run only in relays, but Pearson, 27, has continually prioritised Glasgow, despite a year hampered by a hamstring injury and now family worries. Pearson’s mother, Anne, is from Kent and the Australian has been staying with her aunt and uncle in the county since June 2. She had been looking forward to the family travelling up to Glasgow to support her but found out on Friday that her aunt was ill in intensive care. Challenge: England's Tiffany Porter will do battle with Pearson in the 100m hurdles in Glasgow . She said: ‘We are a very close family so it’s very hard at the moment. There are a lot of things going through my head. It’s like, “Give me a break. Let’s get a gold medal at the Commonwealth Games”.’ Pearson, who faces England’s Tiffany Porter over the 100m hurdles on Horse Guards Parade in the Sainsbury’s Anniversary Games on Sunday, may yet double up in the 100m and hurdles in Glasgow. She did that four years ago in Delhi and crossed the line first in both before being disqualified from the flat sprint for a false start. The complaining nation, of course, just had to be England. ‘I got over that pretty quickly,’ said Pearson. ‘But I’m desperate to run it again.’ Emotional: Pearson's aunt is currently in intensive care and she is determined to win for her .

The 4,000m four-man event, which takes place in the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome on Thursday, is one of the few Commonwealth disciplines which also forms part of the Olympic programme.

Representing: Sir Bradley Wiggins will be riding for England at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow . In practice: Wiggins during a training session at the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome in Glasgow . It would also be the cyclist’s eighth Olympic medal overall, a tally that would take him above Sir Chris to become Britain’s most decorated Olympian in his own right. The Scot won six golds and a silver. Wiggins said: ‘I’d love to get five gold medals - five sounds better than four in terms of being a nice number - and when I was a kid Steve Redgrave was the one who set the standard, really. I never imagined that one day I would come close to equalling his medal haul. ‘But then to surpass it in terms of all the other coloured medals that you have, and also Sir Chris, that would be an incredible way to finish.

Yet she is still just 17 years old; a schoolgirl waiting for her AS exam results in English, PE and business this summer. Her selection as the youngest member of England’s athletics team for the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow caused those two worlds of teenager and athlete to collide, perhaps a little too soon. As revealed by Sportsmail, Lake has withdrawn from the Games to compete in the heptathlon at the World Junior Championships in Oregon, USA. She decided to prioritise her long-term ambitions but was also concerned about the lack of  contact she would have with her father and coach, Eldon, as he would not have been allowed to stay in the athletes’ village. This allowed England to call up Grace Clements, 30, as Lake’s replacement but also sparked much debate and some criticism. Disgruntled: Teenage heptathlon star Morgan Lake has pulled out of England's team . Team: British heptathlon star Lake with her father and coach Eldon Lake . Lake’s father left it entirely for her to decide. Eldon, 45, a former British junior international triple jumper now working as an IT consultant, is not a pushy parent. ‘It was a difficult one; a real dilemma,’ he said, ‘but Morgan thought the right thing to do was the World Juniors. It was her choice, not mine or anyone else’s. ‘The athletes’ village was a factor. You don’t want to expose her to that environment without all of her usual support structure around her. ‘She’s just 17 and we didn’t take all these things into account when she was first selected. It’s late notice but it’s the right  solution in terms of Morgan’s long-term development. People like Usain Bolt went through World Juniors before they graduated to seniors. We wanted to do both but we weren’t allowed.’ Success has come quickly for Lake, the British junior heptathlon record-holder and second on the under-20 all-time list behind Katarina Johnson-Thompson after scoring 6,081 points in Gotzis, Austria, last month. She trains for only an hour a few times a week yet still has nearly three years to better Johnson-Thompson’s under-20 score of 6,287 points.

Lake has . also recently been warm-weather training in Tenerife with Grace . Davies-Redmond, the 16-year-old daughter of British Olympians Sharron . Davies and Derek Redmond. Lake said: ‘I remember watching Jess at the . Olympics and thinking it was amazing to see a heptathlete in the . limelight. I watched it and thought, “I’d like to be at the Olympics one . day”. ‘Jess and Kat have all the records so it’s something for me to chase;  milestones to achieve. For the 2016 Olympics in Rio I just want to make the team. Who knows about four or eight years after that?’ Lake is more like Lewis than Ennis-Hill. She excels in the throws and high jump, in which she has cleared 1.93metres this season, although a 200m lifetime best of 24.59sec was her personal highlight of the performance in Gotzis. She was called Morgan because her parents were expecting a boy. She started athletics when she was just five, she and younger brother Gabriel following dad to the track. Mum Sara ‘isn’t sporty but knows all my results,’ says Lake, with a smile. What could be an intense  relationship between father (coach) and daughter is helped by the fact Lake is still at boarding school in Berkshire. ‘It’s good having Dad as a coach,’ she says, ‘most of the time! He’s been through it when he was younger, so he can help me get through the hard stuff. It’s a good balance.’ Eldon, though, admits it can be difficult combining the roles. ‘When things are going well it’s brilliant,’ he says, ‘but there are days when it’s like Brian and Nigel Clough. Then we look at it, discuss it and in the end she does what I want her to do. ‘But she’s a fighter. She’s determined in training but the best comes out of her in competitions. She wasn’t always the most talented, or the most natural but she worked hard to become the best.’","Morgan Lake pulled out of England’s team for the Commonwealth Games .

Dasaolu said: ‘It’s only my second race of the season so I know I’ve got more to give and more to come, and I won’t be at the Commonwealths so it’s good to have a chance to race in this stadium. ‘For the Europeans it’s an unfortunate situation. If I get selected then I get selected, but if I don’t I’ll continue to race at a high level and against the best guys in the world.’ Heptathlete Katarina Johnson-Thompson, meanwhile, continued her excellent season by finally landing the ‘monster’ leap she craved in her favourite event, the long jump. The 21-year-old added 11cm to her lifetime best to record 6.92m — the second furthest jump ever by a British athlete — and finish second behind Tianna Bartoletta of the USA, beating British record-holder Shara Proctor in the process. Bad night at the office: Blake was taken away from the track in a wheelchair . Canadian Brianne Theisen-Eaton, Johnson-Thompson’s main rival for Commonwealth heptathlon gold, was in the stadium last night to watch her husband, decathlon world record-holder Ashton Eaton, compete in the 400m hurdles. The Olympic champion posted a huge personal best of 48.69sec to finish second in an elite field, but Johnson-Thompson’s performance will surely have disrupted the  family’s celebrations. Johnson-Thompson said: ‘I’ve fallen in love with the stadium and I can’t wait for the Commonwealths.’ Last time Eilidh Child visited Hampden Park she saw Paul Hartley score a hat-trick as her beloved Hearts beat Hibernian 4-0 to reach the 2006 Scottish Cup final. Not the way it should have gone: Blake looks dejected as he leaves the track . Eight years on, Child, Scotland’s team captain for the Commonwealth Games, was one of the main attractions herself, and backed up her star billing with a commanding victory in the 400m hurdles. Her time of 54.39sec was a season’s best and just 0.17sec off her Scottish national record, which Child feels she will have to ‘smash’ to win Commonwealth gold. This vast stadium may have been less than a tenth full, but the roar that greeted Child driving off the final bend in first place gave a sense of what it might be like  during Games time. Last night, however, there were enough spare seats for Child to hear her father Ronnie’s ‘deep, kind of nervous voice’ down the back straight. The 27-year-old said: ‘I’d like to think races like that bring out the best in me. When you have a bit more pressure it helps you raise your game so, hopefully, come the Games, I can do that again.’ Former world champion Dai Greene, however, pulled out of the men’s 400m hurdles, effectively ruling himself out of the European Championships. The British team will be selected on Monday and the Welshman has not matched the qualifying standard after a season disrupted by injury. William Sharman equalled his personal best of 13.21sec to win the 110m hurdles, while six-time Paralympic champion David Weir judged his race perfectly to win the T54 1500m and Stef Reid won a $15,000 cheque for setting a new world record of 5.47m in the F44 long jump.","Jamaican sprinter Yohan Blake pulls up in 100m at Glasgow Grand Prix .

Protector: Oosterbroek is pictured here protecting Lady Gaga while the singer was leaving a Paris hotel. He died on Monday . When police arrived they found the bodyguard fighting with Mr Jung. According to the report, officers said they saw him ingest an unknown substance during the fight before he violently resisted arrest. They tasered him in the chest and he collapsed at the scene. He was pronounced dead a short time later at Baptist Hospital. Authorities say the father-of-two, who was photographed the world over accompanying stars to events, had long had drug issues. According to the Herald, he had been in and out of rehab for years. Many hoped his problems were behind him in 2009 when he married girlfriend April McDaniel in a lavish ceremony at New York's Botanical Garden. Celebrity lifestyle: Oosterbroek has been pictured all over the world with his clients who included Beyonce, pictured . Favorite: Oosterbroek was chosen by dozens of celebrities to run their security. He became famous in South Africa guarding Nelson Mandela . The pair and their two children split their time between the city and South Florida where they were renting a four-bedroom, three-bathroom $500,000 home next to the Jungs. He appeared to be returning home when he wrongly ended up outside the Jung mansion. 'He was highly violent, uncontrollable and obviously wasn’t stable,' Nancy Perez, spokeswoman for Miami-Dade police, which is investigating the incident, told the newspaper. Officers said they believed he was ingesting cocaine on the basis of his heightened body temperature. It is the second time in recent months that Miami police have been involved in a taser death. Colombian-born Israel Hernandez-Llach died after police shocked him as he ran away from officers who caught him spray-painting the wall of a shuttered McDonald's. Police would not divulge how many times Oosterbroek was struck on Monday night or how many officers were involved in his arrest, according to the report.

Roman and Shaw were . arrested on Monday night and detained at the county's juvenile center . before being released to their parents, the Orlando Sentinel reports. They were charged with felony aggravated stalking. Missed: Rebecca Sedwick took her own life after being relentlessly bullied . Several media outlets released the names and mugshots of the young girls after law enforcement officials identified them at a press conference on Tuesday. It is believed the bullying started when Shaw started dating Rebecca's ex-boyfriend. Witnesses told investigators she sent messages to Rebecca, calling her ugly, telling her to 'drink bleach and die', and encouraging her to kill herself. The 12-year-old was jumped in school and repeatedly hounded in online messages or texts telling her to kill herself and that she was ugly. Her computer searches revealed she had searched for ways to commit suicide and asked questions like, 'What is overweight for a 13-year-old girl' . One of the Florida girl's screensavers also showed Rebecca with her head resting on a railroad track. She changed one of her online screen names to 'That Dead Girl.' She messaged a boy: 'I'm jumping.' Devastated: Rebecca Ann Sedwick, 12, pictured with her mother Tricia Norman, is said to have had a disturbing upbringing . Tragic loss: Rebecca with her sister Amy . Aftermath: Rebecca's sister Summer (left) and a friend sign a poster after her death. Two people have now been arrested in connection with the bullying . Polk County Sheriff Judd said Rebecca had been 'absolutely terrorized' by the other girls. 'We can see from what we've been investigating so far that Rebecca wasn't attacking back,' Judd said. 'She . appeared to be beat down. She appeared to have a defeatist attitude. And quite frankly, the entire investigation is exceptionally . disturbing.' Even when her mother took Rebecca out of school, the bullying was carried out online. The bullying started . over a boy last year at Crystal Lake Middle School and at one point she . was suspended for fighting with another student - believed to be Roman. Last December, . Rebecca was hospitalized for three days after cutting her wrists because . of what she said was bullying, according to the sheriff. 'When . she was being bullied at Crystal Lake Middle, she used to come home . every day and tell me how she wasn’t worth anything, that she was ugly, . how she was stupid,' her mother Tricia Norman said after her death. 'And . I said, ''Baby what on earth would make you think that? You’re the most . beautiful person I know and the smartest person I know.''' Bullied: Rebecca was withdrawn from her . elementary school after being bullied and was home schooled by her mother Tricia (right) who says her daughter's death should be a warning to all parents to be vigilant . Tributes: Flowers, candles and messages are left out in memory of 12-year-old Rebecca . Later, after Rebecca . complained that she had been pushed in the hallway and that another girl . wanted to fight her, Rebecca's mother began home-schooling her, Judd . said. This fall, Rebecca . started at a new school, Lawton Chiles Middle Academy, and loved it, . Judd said. But the bullying continued online. 'She put on a perfect, happy face. She never told me,' Tricia Norman told the Lakeland Ledger. 'I never had a clue. I mean, she told me last year when she was being bullied, but not this year, and I have no idea why.' Once . police checked her cell phone they discovered that the bullying had not . stopped, especially on Kik Messenger, Instagram and Ask.fm. 'They would tell her she's ugly, stupid, nobody liked her go kill herself,"" Ms Norman said. She has started a Facebook page to try to fight back against online bullies, called Rebecca Sedwick Against Bullying. Ms Norman told 10 News she was inspired to start it after reading her daughter's journal. In . it, Rebecca had written: 'Every day more and more kids kill themselves . because of bullying. How many lives have to be lost until people realize . words do matter?' Ms Norman . wants online bullies to face harsher consequences, and begged other . young victims to stay strong and seek help, adding: 'Don't ever give up, . like Becca did.'

"By . James Gordon . A coffee controversy is brewing. A new cafe in Los Angeles is calling itself Dumb Starbucks Coffee and using the same logo as the global coffee giant, but staff insist they're not breaking any laws. In fact, it looks almost identical to the real Starbucks apart from one word - 'dumb'. The coffee shop which is based in the Los Feliz / Silverlake area of the city says that by using the word, it makes it a parody and is therefore permissible under freedom of speech laws. Scroll down for video . Just great coffee: A parody coffee shop mocking Starbucks opened in Los Angeles and quickly became a sensation on social media . Dumb: Although it looks liked Starbucks, smells like Starbucks and even acts like Starbucks (the super-friendly baristas asking for your name were hired off Craigslist), the whole thing is an elaborate goof on Starbucks culture . It's all so dumb: You can buy an dumb iced coffee or a dumb vent - or how about some dumb jazz standards? A flyer with FAQ's explains that it is a legit coffee house and is completely legal thanks to 'parody law' being on its side (also known as 'fair use') that would allow it to skirt trademarks. 'Although we are a fully functioning coffee shop, for legal reasons Dumb Starbucks needs to be categorize as a work of parody art. So, in the eyes of the law, our 'coffee shop' is actually an art gallery and the 'coffee' you’re buying is considered the art. But that’s for our lawyers to worry about. All you need to do is enjoy our delicious coffee!' People have been lining up for Dumb Coffee for up to an hour just to get their hands on a cup — part novelty, part collector’s item. When you reach the front of the line you can order a Dumb Venti or perhaps take home a CD of Dumb Jazz Standards or perhaps some Dumb Norah Jones Duets. FAQs: There are plenty of questions. Is it legal? Probably not! Dumb people: People waited in line for an hour this weekend for coffee that wasn't very good either. However, it was free . Dumb Starbucks are justifying their cafe by saying that their store is a 'parody' and therefore protected by freedom of speech legislation. Under such law, certain parodies of trademarks may be permissible if they are not too directly tied to commercial use. In this case, the cafe isn't charging for the drinks it is providing and can therefore argue that their pop-up shop is not for commercial gain. The basic idea here is that the artistic and editorial parodies of trademarks serve a valuable critical function and is entitled to some degree of First Amendment protection. Of course, Starbucks' own lawyers will likely argue that this 'store' is damaging their carefully guarded brand, image and reputation. It may very well end up that the people behind Dumb Starbucks will be the ones left feeling dumb. All of the coffee, brewed by two baristas, is free. There's a Dumb Starbucks menu, even Dumb Starbucks cups (in Dumb Grande, Dumb Venti and Dumb Tall sizes). You can also pick up a Dumb Espresso, Dumb Iced Coffee, and Dumb Frappuccinos. The store, calling itself a legit coffeehouse, features the same logo and look and colors of the famous coffee chain. The baristas are no wiser as to who is behind the stunt saying that they simply answered a 'help wanted' ad on Craigslist. Rumors are circulating that it is really a piece of performance art, perhaps for a TV show. Despite its popularity with lines out the door, customers seemed confused about what exactly was going on. 'I saw online that there was a Dumb Starbucks sign. One of my friends posted about it, and I live across the street, so I just walked over,' one customer said. He described it as 'weirdly off-kilter.' The FAQ sheet explains a little more about the existence of the store. 'We . love Starbucks and look up to them as role models. Unfortunately, the . only way to use their intellectual property under fair use is if we are . making fun of them. So the word 'dumb' comes out of necessity, not . enmity.' Strangely familiar: The place looked like a regular Starbucks, only with the word 'Dumb' everywhere . Collectors piece: Part of the attraction was the specially made logo cups . Dumb Starbucks has a Twitter account at @dumbstarbucks, and even local fans like The Office’s Rainn Wilson are posting pictures. One person joked that you should get there 'before dumb lawyers get to it.' Starbucks is notorious for defending its trademark. The real Starbucks has confirmed that the store isn't one of theirs and is looking into the matter. You can find the Dumb Starbucks at 1802 Hillhurst Avenue in Los Feliz ...for now.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Updated: . 02:06 EST, 26 November 2011 . This year’s Black Friday is on course to become the biggest on record as millions of shoppers scramble to get their hands on bargains. A staggering 152 million people are predicted to shop over the weekend, up 10 per cent on last year, according to the National Retail Federation. With consumer spending accounting for 70 per cent of the U.S. economy, it comes as a much-needed lifeline for the country's ailing finances - and signals good news for shops in the run up to Christmas. Surge: Bargain hunters shop for discounted merchandise at Macy's in New York City on 'Black Friday'. Analysts predict there will be a record number of shoppers and sales this year - 10 per cent on last year . And even the generous estimate by the NRF is expected to fall short, according to a spokesperson. Black Friday online sales across the U.S were up 20 per cent, according to IBM. And Thanksgiving Day saw a 39 per cent rise in internet retail revenue. Last year, the organisation estimated there would be 138 million shoppers over the weekend – but 212 million showed up. Consulting firm Customer Growth Partners predicts sales in the first 24 hours of Black Friday may grow to $27 billion. This is an eight per cent increase from the same period a year ago. Analysts suggested the surge could be driven by the new trend of shops opening on Thursday. Walmart joined KMart and Toys R Us to open on Thanksgiving. They were closely followed by Target, Best Buy, Macy’s and Kohl’s, whose doors opened at midnight for the first time. ‘Black . Friday will be strong because so many stores are opening Thursday and . that gives consumers at least six more hours to shop,’ Candace Corlett . of WSL Strategic Retail, a New York-based consulting firm, told CNN. Early start: Analysts believe the increase could be thanks to shops opening on Thursday for the first time. Toys R Us opened at 9pm on Thanksgiving Day in a bid to entice early shoppers, as did Walmart . Determined: Other shops, including Target, pictured, opened at midnight. Macy's, Kohl's and Best Buy also opened at 12. As is the case every year, some shoppers camped outside stores for days to be the first inside . ‘It will also attract people who may be willing to go out Thursday night, but aren't about to get up early Friday morning.’ Amanda Rottmueller, a 20-year-old nursing student, told Bloomberg she was drawn to the Black Friday sales for the first time due to the new nighttime openings. ‘I’m out tonight to buy stuff that I need,’ Rottmueller said at the Tri-County Mall in Cincinnati after purchasing discounted bras and pjamas. ‘The deal is just too good, and I can get something really nice I wouldn’t be able to afford otherwise.’ Analysts also predicted low consumer confidence was encouraging stores to add more discounts, leading to a boost in sales. LCD TV prices are expected to hit an . all-time low this Black Friday, according to DisplaySearch. Bargains: Shoppers have been enticed by buys such as LCD TVs - expected to hit an all-time low this weekend . Retailers are also increasing the number of Black Friday deals offered online between now and Monday. As they fend off frantic shoppers, stores around the country agree they have seen more shoppers than any previous year. About 15,000 people waited for the . midnight opening of the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, . almost doubling last year’s line, spokesman Dan Jasper told Bloomberg. Black Friday visitors at the largest mall in the country may reach a record 200,000, about seven per cent more than last year, he said.

Consumer spending, which accounts for . about 70 per cent of the U.S. economy, increased for 16 consecutive . months up to October as the economy added jobs and avoided slipping into . another recession. It comes despite Occupy Wall Street’s attempts to quell shoppers ‘to send an economic message to big business and banks that profits over consumers is not good business’. ‘I don't think it's going to have any impact on consumer spending for Christmas,’ Britt Beemer, retail analyst and chairman of America's Research Group, told CNN. ‘Unless protestors happen to be blocking the entrance of a store.’","152million to hit the shops over Thanksgiving weekend, up 10 per cent .

"By . Mark Prigg . Nasa has captured one of the most active aurora ever seen on Saturn. Researchers say the incredible video created by Hubble and Cassini give the 'best look yet' at the phenomenon. They say the video will give a major step forward in understanding the atmospheres of giant planets. Scroll down for video . NASA's Cassini spacecraft has revealed similar curtain-like auroras to those seen on Earth - except on Saturn, they are red at the bottom and purple at the top. Nasa trained several pairs of eyes on Saturn as the planet put on a dancing light show at its poles. While the Hubble Space Telescope, orbiting around Earth, was able to observe the northern auroras in ultraviolet wavelengths, Nasa's Cassini spacecraft, orbiting around Saturn, got complementary close-up views in infrared, visible-light and ultraviolet wavelengths. Cassini could also see northern and southern parts of Saturn that don't face Earth. The resulting video is 'a kind of step-by-step choreography detailing how the auroras move, showing the complexity of these auroras and how scientists can connect an outburst from the sun and its effect on the magnetic environment at Saturn,' says Nasa. 'Saturn's auroras can be fickle -- you may see fireworks, you may see nothing,' said Jonathan Nichols of the University of Leicester in England, who led the work on the Hubble images. 'In 2013, we were treated to a veritable smorgasbord of dancing auroras, from steadily shining rings to super-fast bursts of light shooting across the pole.' The Hubble and Cassini images were focused on April and May of 2013. Images from Cassini's ultraviolet imaging spectrometer (UVIS), obtained from an unusually close range of about six Saturn radii, provided a look at the changing patterns of faint emissions on scales of a few hundred miles (kilometers) and tied the changes in the auroras to the fluctuating wind of charged particles blowing off the sun and flowing past Saturn. 'This is our best look yet at the rapidly changing patterns of auroral emission,' said Wayne Pryor, a Cassini co-investigator at Central Arizona College. 'Some bright spots come and go from image to image. 'Other bright features persist and rotate around the pole, but at a rate slower than Saturn's rotation.' The dark region seen on the face of the sun at the end of March 2013 is a coronal hole (just above and to the right of the middle of the picture), which is a source of fast solar wind leaving the sun, and caused the aurora on Saturn . The image also suggest that one way the bright auroral storms may be produced is by the formation of new connections between magnetic field lines. That process causes storms in the magnetic bubble around Earth. The movie also shows one persistent bright patch of the aurora rotating in lockstep with the orbital position of Saturn's moon Mimas. While previous UVIS images had shown an intermittent auroral bright spot magnetically linked to the moon Enceladus, the new movie suggests another Saturn moon can influence the light show as well. The new data also give scientists clues to a long-standing mystery about the atmospheres of giant outer planets. 'Scientists have wondered why the high atmospheres of Saturn and other gas giants are heated far beyond what might normally be expected by their distance from the sun,' said Sarah Badman, a Cassini visual and infrared mapping spectrometer team associate at Lancaster University, England. 'By looking at these long sequences of images taken by different instruments, we can discover where the aurora heats the atmosphere as the particles dive into it and how long the cooking occurs.' The visible-light data have helped scientists work out the colors of Saturn's auroras. While the curtain-like auroras we see at Earth are green at the bottom and red at the top, Cassini's imaging cameras have shown us similar curtain-like auroras at Saturn that are red at the bottom and purple at the top, said Ulyana Dyudina, an imaging team associate at the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, Calif. The color difference occurs because Earth's auroras are dominated by excited nitrogen and oxygen molecules, and Saturn's auroras are dominated by excited hydrogen molecules. 'We were thrilled to learn about this colorful display that no one had seen before,' Dyudina said. 'The auroras at Saturn are some of the planet's most glamorous features – and there was no escaping NASA's paparazzi-like attention', said Marcia Burton, a Cassini fields and particles scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., who is helping to coordinate these observations.","Nasa video shows the northern auroras in unprecedented detail .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Guarantee: Shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg says Labour will help parents get back into work . Primary schools will have to offer childcare from 8am to 6pm under Labour plans to help working families. The guarantee that children can be looked after outside traditional school hours is designed to help parents who struggle to fit jobs in with ferrying their children around. Labour is also examining a radical plan to allow grandparents to take time off from work, similar to maternity leave, to help look after their grandchildren. Shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg will tomorrow argue that the plan to guarantee primary-aged childcare will help get parents back into work, providing a boost to the wider economy. The new Labour policy is one of several aimed at tackling the cost of living expected to be announced at the party’s annual conference in Brighton. There will also be a promise to strengthen the minimum wage, reverse benefits changes dubbed the ‘bedroom tax’ and action to reduce energy bills. Under the ‘Primary Childcare Guarantee’ parents will still have to pay for the childcare through state-funded vouchers or their own money. But by ensuring schools remain open and willing to look after children from 8am to 6pm, parents can commit to working longer hours. In his speech to the Labour conference tomorrow, Mr Twigg will say: ‘For school-age children, childcare has become a logistical nightmare. ‘David Cameron scrapped Labour’s programme to support before and after-school clubs, leaving many parents struggling to juggle work and family life. ‘If we want an economy that works for working people, we must support parents trying to balance these pressures.’ The Primary Childcare Guarantee will be written into law if Labour wins the 2015 election, Mr Twigg will announce. Conference: Labour leader Ed Miliband (left in Brighton today) and deputy leader Harriet Harman (right) are at pains to prove they have election-fighting policies at the annual conference, which begins tomorrow . ‘This will give all parents of primary school children the certainty that they can access childcare from 8am-6pm through their school. A clear message to hard working parents: Labour is on your side.’ But in a blow to Mr Miliband's claim to be helping people feeling the pinch, a new poll shows most people still blame Labour. The YouGov survey found 30 per cent said Labour was to to blame for the fall in living standards over the last few years, compared with 16 per cent who blame the Conservatives alone and 9 per cent who blame the coalition. Q&A: Ed Miliband's wife Justine (in red coat, below right) spoke in Brighton ahead of the Labour Party annual conference . All parties together are blamed by 19 per cent while just one per cent said it was the fault of the Lib Dems. Tackling the costs and difficulties of bringing up children have become a major political battleground. Parenting costs: Labour leader Ed Miliband and his wife Justine took the chance to take their children Daniel (right) and Sam (left) for a walk along Brighton beach today . Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg this week announced that all children in reception, year one and year two will receive free school meals. He argued the policy aimed at children aged seven and under will reduce costs for parents while increasing attainment. Conservative childcare minister Liz Truss has also pushed for reform of rules for nurseries and childminders to cut costs. Labour points to figures showing two thirds of parents of need some form of before-and-after school or holiday care to combine family and work. But almost a third of these were unable to find it. Meanwhile, Labour’s deputy leader Harriet Harman is pushing for the party to promise to introduce ‘granny leave’ in its 2015 manifesto. It would allow grandparents to help out with looking after grandchildren without giving up work altogether. Under the plan mothers and fathers would be able to transfer part of their flexible parental leave to grandparents. Ms Harman said many grandmothers in . particular are forced to decide between their own jobs and helping their . daughter or daughter-in-law to return to work.

"By . Steve Hopkins . Argentina has defaulted for the second time in 12 years after last-ditch talks with what it called 'vulture' creditors failed. The failure follows accusations that president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner spent close to £20,000 a . day having the presidential plane bring her the daily newspapers while she was on holiday. An . Argentinian television claims she had the papers flown to the town of . Rio Gallegos, in the south Argentinian province of Santa Cruz. Argentinean .

Opposition UCR party politician Anselmo . Martinez said: 'I can't say that this is a particular surprise because . our country has a history of people using state assets for their own . purposes since the time of Nestor Kirchner. Argentina failed to strike a deal in time to meet a midnight payment deadline after a long legal battle with hedge funds that rejected its debt restructuring following a 2002 default. Argentina fought to suspend a U.S ruling requiring it to pay holdouts of $1.33 billion plus . interest and preventing it from servicing its exchange debt without paying the holdouts at the same time.

The . immediate focus on solving Argentina's debt crisis is on whether a group . of big banks and funds overseen by the International Swaps and . Derivatives Association would declare the situation a 'credit event'. That would set off a series of insurance payments and give most of Argentina's current bondholders the right to demand their money back immediately. The cost of insuring Argentina's debt against default fell sharply today, however, data provider Markit said, as investors speculated a deal could be struck, even if only in the long term. The country's five-year credit default swaps fell more than 400 basis points. Argentina's economy minister Axel Kicilllof speaks to the media about the debt talks .

The bonds at the centre of the struggle had rallied strongly on Wednesday along with Buenos Aires stocks and the peso as bets on a deal rose, but traders were left up in the air after the talks fell apart. Even a short default will raise local companies' borrowing costs, pile more pressure on the peso, drain dwindling foreign reserves and fuel one of the world's highest inflation rates. The default is a far cry from the mayhem following the crash in 2001-2001 when the economy collapsed around a bankrupt government and millions of Argentines lost their jobs. This time the government is solvent. How much pain the default inflicts on Argentina, which is already in recession, will depend on how swiftly the government can extricate itself from its obligations.","Argentina has defaulted for the second time in 12 years .

"By . James Chapman . Gaming machine operators face a clampdown in an attempt to protect problem gamblers. Their betting shop terminals are called the ‘crack cocaine’ of the high street because they allow punters to wager £100 a spin and as much as £18,000 an hour. Don Foster, the Lib Dem communities minister, has campaigned for this to be cut to £2 a spin – in line with bingo halls and casinos. Betting terminals have been branded the 'crack cocaine' of the high street due to the huge amounts they allow punters to bet . David Cameron and Nick Clegg have now agreed to examine a reversal of Labour’s relaxation of gambling regulation. Betting websites which operate from Caribbean islands such as Barbuda and Antigua will be forced to apply for UK licences. Fixed odds terminals were introduced in 2002 and allow players to bet on roulette, poker and blackjack. The number of machines has soared to 32,000 from 16,380 in 2007. Britons have become so addicted to them that at least £46billion is expected to be staked this year. The Coalition’s all-powerful quad – Mr Cameron, Mr Clegg, George Osborne and Danny Alexander – has agreed to reject a call from the Commons culture committee for there to be fewer restrictions on the machines. Instead, it has ordered a review of stakes, numbers of machines and prize levels. Councils may also be given powers to curb the terminals. Lib Dem Communities Minister Don Foster has campaigned for betting limits to be cut to £2 a spin . ‘For too long, this problem has been swept under the carpet,’ said Mr Foster. ‘There’s no doubt this is ruining people’s lives. Fixed odds betting terminals have incredibly high stakes and prizes. People chase their losses. These machines are getting more and more sophisticated. ‘From telephone calls to gambling helplines, we do know that increasingly these machines are being used by large numbers of people who are saying they are getting into difficulty and need help.’ He told the Daily Mail that young and unemployed men were the most regular players. ‘There are very many in the industry themselves who have concerns about it, though they are very reluctant to say much about it because they are worried about the impact it might have on other parts of the industry,’ he added. ‘Some bookmakers’ shops are now making as much as 70 to 80 per cent of their takings from the machines.’ Mr Foster said the Labour Party had allowed the machines to spread but now admitted this was a mistake. ‘MPs from all parties have been expressing concern,’ he said. ‘As a result of that protest, I am delighted that I can tell you that the Government has agreed at the most senior level that we are now going to conduct a review into the evidence for the need to look again at the levels of stakes and prizes and other issues related to these fixed odds betting terminals. ‘We can look at the level of the stakes, we can look at the number of machines that are allowed, we can look at the spin rate. David Cameron and Nick Clegg are expected to examine a reversal of Labour's relaxation of gambling regulations . 'This is a real victory for all those, including the Daily Mail, that have expressed real concern about these machines, which frankly are an aberration.’ Mr Foster said he favoured a maximum stake of £2, but it would be up to the industry to make a case for higher amounts. He also said the Government would shake up the regulation of offshore gaming websites, saying it was ‘crazy’ that many taking bets from British punters were registered so far away. ‘We intend to have some form of secondary licensing system where if you want to advertise and do business in this country then you have to have a UK imprimatur to ensure you are regulated here and are making a contribution to taxes here,’ he added. Gareth Wallace, of the Salvation Army, said: ‘We warmly welcome that the Government is going to look at limits on the numbers of these machines and a reduction in the stakes. All the evidence is that they are far more addictive than other forms of gambling. Bringing regulation for websites onshore is also a good thing.’ In July, the culture committee called for a relaxation of ‘puritanical’ gambling laws. It said councils should approve the creation of more casinos, which should be permitted to provide up to 20 high stakes gambling machines.","Lib Dems campaign to lower betting limits at terminals .

"By . Chris Hastings, Arts Correspondent . Former Culture Secretary David Mellor has launched a scathing attack on the appointment of Judith Weir as Master of the Queen’s Music, saying he would ‘rather be thrown into a pit of scorpions’ than listen to one of her operas. Mellor, The Mail on Sunday’s classical music critic, said the chorus of approval that greeted Weir’s appointment was solely because she was the first woman to hold the historic post. In an outspoken article in today’s Event magazine, he writes: ‘Rather than focus on her being the first woman to hold the post, would it not be better to concentrate on whether this is a job she is capable of doing? Former Culture Secretary David Mellor has launched a scathing attack on the appointment of Judith Weir, pictured, as Master of the Queen’s Music . ‘The Master of the Queen’s Music has to musically celebrate great national events in a way the British public can relate to. 'Try as I might, I find her music pretty impenetrable and, when penetrable, unrewarding. I’d rather be thrown into a pit of scorpions than have to sit through another of her operas.’ Mellor, 65, said her appointment was another example of Britain’s music establishment ‘cocking a snook at the British people’. ‘If they can’t get someone more accessible than her, maybe it’s time the post was abolished,’ he writes. Weir, 60, whose operas include The Vanishing Bridegroom, The Black Spider and Blond Eckbert, succeeded Sir Peter Maxwell Davies in the post last month. Her work has been compared to that of Benjamin Britten. One critic praised her ability to make simple musical ideas appear ‘freshly mysterious’. David Mellor (pictured), The Mail on Sunday’s classical music critic, said the chorus of approval that greeted Weir’s appointment was solely because she was the first woman to hold the historic post . The post of Master of the Queen’s duties dates back to 1626 but the precise duties attached to the role are unclear. Holders of the post, who receive a £15,000-a-year salary, are expected to write pieces to commemorate Royal events such as coronations, birthdays and anniversaries. They serve a fixed ten-year term, during which they may also act as the personal adviser to the Monarch on musical matters. Last night, Sir Peter, Weir’s predecessor, said the attack on Weir was ‘unfair, misguided and ill-informed’. ‘I could use stronger language but I don’t think it would be in keeping with the dignity of the post,’ said Sir Peter, who recommended Weir for the job. ‘She is a world-class composer, much admired internationally, who can write across a very wide range. This is an unfair, misguided and ill-informed attack on somebody who we should be celebrating as a wonderful talent. Judith got it because she deserved it – not because she was a woman. She is an outstanding composer.’ John Allison, editor of Opera Magazine, also came to her defence, saying: ‘Judith has always been one of the strongest contenders for the post and she has been chosen on merit. She writes music right across the genres, which does appeal to people. Who do her critics have in mind for the appointment? Andrew Lloyd Webber? Elton John?’ The praise for Weir has not always been so effusive. Her most recent opera, Miss Fortune, which opened in 2012, was panned by critics, with one branding it ‘an embarrassment’. Weir’s spokesman refused to comment when approached by The Mail on Sunday, but on the announcement of her appointment last month, the composer said: ‘I hope to encourage everyone in the UK who sings, plays or writes music, and to hear as many of them as possible in action over the next ten years. ‘Listening is also a skill, and I intend to uphold our rights to quietness and even silence, where appropriate. Our children deserve the best we can give them, including access to live music, whether as learners, performers or listeners.’","David Mellor launches scathing attack on appointment of new Master of the Queen's Music .

"By . Sam Greenhill . The only way is up: David Miliband's new job as head of a charity in the U.S. is likely to likely to be five times higher than his salary as a Labour MP . When he swaps South Shields for Manhattan, David Miliband will be earning more than President Obama. As head of the International Rescue Committee, his pay package is likely to be about £300,000 – nearly five times higher than his wage as a Labour MP. On top of his salary comes complimentary private health care, a gold-plated, tax-free pension and a host of other perks. The IRC said Mr Miliband’s pay was ‘private’ yesterday, but the organisation’s outgoing president got £295,000 a year for a 37-and-a-half hour week. And, as a former Foreign Secretary who counts the Clintons and Blairs as close friends, Mr Miliband was in a position to command an even more generous deal. The IRC’s money comes mainly from grants from taxpayers – including £110million of British aid over the last ten years. But from the moment he steps into his well-appointed office, near New York’s Grand Central Station, Mr Miliband will be in charge of a vast humanitarian organisation. It has 12,000 staff, and spent £240million on its programmes last year. Yet despite the scale of his new job, Mr Miliband is understood to be keeping his lucrative sideline as a director of Sunderland FC – for which he is paid £125,000 for 15 days work. The IRC, founded at the request of Albert Einstein in 1933, helps refugees from 40 countries including Syria, Afghanistan and Haiti. It is a highly-regarded charity and its directors and ‘overseers’ include Henry Kissinger and former UN chief Kofi Annan. Mr Miliband is likely to have been offered a number of perks to take up the role. These could include a housing allowance, limo allowance and health club membership. ‘It is not unusual for the charities to offer help with housing for someone who is moving to New York for the first time,’ said Pete Smith, who has studied the pay of charity leaders for US watchdog Charity Navigator. Mr Miliband’s salary will be complemented by an estimated £8,000 towards private health insurance and a further £22,000 a year payment towards his pension. A former IRC insider said: ‘He will have a big office in a nice part of New York. ‘It has a desk with big windows looking out over the city, and a large settee with space for several people to have informal meetings. Pastures new: David Miliband announced he is quitting politics to become head of a charity in New York . Connections: As a former foreign secretary who counts the Clintons as friends, Miliband was likely to have commanded an even higher salary than his predecessor . ‘Miliband will be treated as a senior global executive, and in America such people are revered. They have big responsibilities and although they need to have that self-belief they are here to help people, basically they are not doing it “for charity”. ‘It’s a big operation and you have got to be on the ball. Prestige: The International Rescue Committee charity was set up by Albert Einstein . ‘There is a huge competition for funding among aid agencies whenever there is an emergency, and this is where somebody of David’s calibre will have the confidence to go into meetings with top people and make them get their chequebooks out.’ About two-thirds of the IRC’s £260million annual funding comes from US taxpayers, but over the past ten years Britain has donated £110million. Since leaving government, Mr Miliband has earned nearly £1million on top of his £65,000 MP’s salary. Commanding up to £20,000 as a speaker, his earnings total £985,315 including travel and accommodation for himself and his staff, according to the most recently published Commons register. Flying around the globe, from the US to the Middle East, he took more than £64,400 from the advisory board of the United Arab Emirates ministry of foreign affairs, and £90,000 from the California-based Vantage-Point investment firm advising on international energy opportunities. He even charged £7,650 for a cancelled speech to the Malaysian Investment Development Authority. But now Mr Miliband is joining a charity,  he could feel under pressure to lead by example – and may be interested to know that in 2007 his predecessor at the IRC, George Rupp, and his wife, Nancy, personally donated $1million – worth three years’ wages.","Top job at International Rescue Committee charity includes number of perks .

Secret new ingredient: The 'GBBO effect' is expected to see freeze-dried raspberry and strawberry powders flying off the shelves after they feature in the series, which begins on Wednesday on BBC1 . High street chains have been stocking up on the little-known ingredients in anticipation of them becoming bestsellers. A spokeswoman for the show told The Mail on Sunday they would be one of the baking trends of the show, which will also feature edible flowers and paneer cheese. The fruit powders, traditionally used in chocolate making and patisserie on the Continent, have caught on in Britain with top chefs such  as Heston Blumenthal. The powders are punchily concentrated. It takes 2.2lb of fresh berries to make every 3.5oz of berry powder. Bake Off star Mary Berry revealed last week that she had only recently discovered the powders. She told Radio Times: ‘Last year I learnt about freeze-dried raspberry powder. Because I don’t research my recipes on the internet, I knew nothing about it. Then  I went home and tried it.’ She was inspired by Kimberley Wilson, one of last year’s finalists, who used it to decorate her chocolate truffles on the first programme of the series.

She’s been cooking for so long I thought it would be old-hat to her.’ Tina Manahai-Mahai, of Healthy Supplies, an online specialist ingredients site which sells 100g berry powders for £5.99, said: ‘Sales of freeze-dried raspberry powder went up 97 per cent after the end  of the last Bake Off series. If they feature more this time, they’ll fly off the shelves.’ The powders are also on sale at Waitrose, Sainsbury’s and Asda.

Launched last month, Osper is marketed at users aged eight to 18. The company says its product – which is endorsed by Davina McCall and has the backing of MasterCard – promotes safe spending by harnessing the ‘highest level of security currently available for under-18s’. Risk: Online purchases on the Opser debit card - marketed at users aged eight to 18 - have been suspended after The Mail on Sunday exposed how it can be used to buy alcohol, pornography and weapons (file image) But The Mail on Sunday has found that the card – which, after 12 months costs £10 a year – can be used to buy age-restricted items online. It can also be used in a pub. Online transactions have now been suspended and TV presenter Ms McCall last night said: ‘I’m hugely thankful that The MoS has flagged this up and that Osper is already proactively dealing with the issue.’ The card has to be ordered by a parent or guardian who pre-loads it with funds for their child to use. It can also be used in a cash machine. TV presenter: Davina McCall, who endorses the product, last night expressed thanks to the MoS . The parent has access to an app which provides a number of safety features unique among debit cards for children. Osper claims it is ‘the safest way to allow young people to spend online, with built-in limits and controls that block purchases from over-18 sites’. But, using a card registered to an eight-year-old, our reporter was able to make a number of shocking purchases – most disturbingly, accessing a Dutch website offering ‘one-on-one’ interaction with live sex webcams, for £8.11. It was also used at Amazon which, for £14.95, sent the sexually explicit film Nymphomaniac and the violent, 16-certificate computer game Call Of Duty: Ghosts, for £16.11. Other online transactions included a £24.95 two-inch blade from SwissTool.co.uk, and a £7.98 tube of Loctite super glue from B&Q. It was also used to buy alcohol in a pub. The legal responsibility for verifying the age of a customer for an adult product lies with retailers, not a card company. Last night Marion King, of MasterCard, said: ‘When made aware of this issue, we insisted all e-commerce transactions on Osper cards be suspended immediately and expect this issue to be addressed as a matter of urgency.’ And Osper chief executive Alick Varma said: ‘All new and existing Osper parents will be asked to proactively “opt in” if they would like their child to be able to use their Osper Card for online purchases. 'As part of this process, we will clearly communicate to parents the potential risks involved with allowing their children to buy things online.’ Support: The Osper debit card, which has the backing of MasterCard (pictured), can also be used in a pub .","Launched last month, Osper debit card marketed at users aged eight to 18 .

"By . Daniel Martin And Tania Steere . Ed Miliband was monstered on the radio yesterday by a stay-at-home mother who accused him of viewing her contribution as ‘worthless’. Imogen Thompson, who has two children aged six and three, told the Labour leader he put ‘no value’ on women like her who choose not to work. The campaigner, from the group Mothers At Home Matter, said Labour was only interested in women who take jobs – spending millions subsidising childcare. Scroll down for video . Monstered: Ed Miliband was taken to task on the radio by a stay-at-home mother who accused him of viewing her contribution as 'worthless' During the public Q&A on LBC radio, Mr Miliband was also attacked by a small business owner who said he could not see him as a potential prime minister. In an uncomfortable series of calls for the Labour leader, a midwife said his party’s immigration policies had put the NHS under pressure, while another caller said Labour was for the ‘Islington elite’ rather than the working man. His mauling by Mrs Thompson, 35, comes a year after Nick Clegg was taken to task by another stay-at-home mother on his own LBC phone-in show, Call Clegg. Laura Perrins, 32, said the Coalition was ‘discriminating against mothers like me’, adding: ‘You probably think what I do is a worthless job.’ The Coalition angered many stay-at-home mothers after the election with its measures to cut child benefit for higher earners. Yesterday Mr Miliband said he would not reverse the policy, claiming there was no money to do so. Mrs Thompson, from Manchester, said nothing was being done to stop stay-at-home parents being ‘penalised in the tax system’. She added: ‘My husband is the sole earner in our household. ‘We have forfeited my salary in order to provide the childcare at home, we can’t make use of my personal tax allowance – I can’t transfer a penny to him. There are no tax allowances that recognise family care responsibilities as in other OECD countries. We are out of step in the UK. Ed Miliband's radio mauling comes a year after Nick Clegg, pictured, was taken to task by another stay-at-home mother on his own LBC phone-in show, Call Clegg . ‘At the same time the current Coalition are introducing tax-free childcare schemes for parents who are both in employment up to £300,000 for a household. ‘In addition the Coalition have removed child benefit from households on a fraction of this. ‘So single income families like mine pay a disproportionate amount of tax which eats into the amount left to house, clothe, feed and raise my children.’ When Mr Miliband replied: ‘I can’t give you an easy answer. I don’t have an easy solution to this problem,’ she said: ‘I don’t think you have any answer.’ The Labour leader told her: ‘I wouldn’t have chosen to make the child benefit change but we’re going to have trouble reversing that.’ Asked whether he would allow mothers to transfer their tax allowance to their partner, he said: ‘I would love to do all this, but where’s the money going to come from?’ Mrs Thompson replied: ‘Mr Miliband, you’re putting no value on unpaid care at home. You are saying that the unpaid work that I do is worthless.’ Last night Mrs Thompson, a former marketing executive, told the Mail: ‘I think Ed Miliband’s reaction was a bit disappointing. He admitted he had no answers for me. They say they value stay-at-home parents but there’s no evidence.’ Mr Miliband also spoke about his decision to stand against his brother David in the Labour leadership election four years ago, saying it showed he has a ‘tough’ streak.","Ed Miliband taken to task on LBC radio show by stay-at-home mother .

"By . Mark Stainforth, Press Association . Paddy Barnes shrugged off an anthem controversy after claiming Commonwealth Games boxing gold with victory over India's Devendro Laishram at the Hydro in Glasgow. Barnes was caught on television cameras mouthing 'that's not my anthem' to his vanquished opponent as the opening strains of 'Danny Boy' blared out in the 20,000-capacity arena. But Barnes quickly took to Twitter to insist his comment had no political connotations as he celebrating retaining the light-flyweight title he first won in Delhi in 2010. Win: Paddy Barnes shrugged off an anthem controversy after claiming Commonwealth Games boxing gold . Barnes tweeted: 'So I said that's not my anthem, so who cares, it's not NI hasn't got one educate yourselves, football is GSTQ [God Save The Queen] so make your minds up!' He added: 'I'm a sportsman I couldn't care about anything else, I'm Irish, doesn't matter if I'm Catholic of Protestant. 'I won that medal for everyone that supports me, Catholics and Protestants alike, I don't care what your religion is! Some clowns out there!' Barnes produced a controlled performance to defeat the classy Laishram and prove himself a class apart from his opponents in the light-flyweight category. Barnes said: 'That was the hardest fight of my life. I didn't really box my best because he was non-stop. But I was too strong for him. 'I remember fighting in China in front of 13,000 Chinese guys who wanted the head punched off me, but I'll tell you what that was unbelievable out there.' Barnes' team-mate Michael Conlan made it two gold medals for Northern Ireland when he outpointed England's Qais Ashfaq in an entertaining bantamweight brawl. Duck: He retained the light-flyweight title he first won in Delhi in 2010 India's Devendro Laishram . Ashfaq made a strong start and won the first round on two of the three judges' cards but Conlan used his experience and well-picked shots to claw back into the bout. Conlan had edged through to the final on a technical decision after his fight against Welshman Sean McGoldrick was stopped in the second round due to cuts. But the inch-long gash just above Conlan's left eye did not reopen despite the come-forward nature of the contest, and the Northern Irishman made sure of his place on top of the podium. Conlan admitted he was riddled with self-doubt weeks before the Games because of fitness concerns. 'I have only trained for this competition for two weeks,' he said. 'I was out injured and only had seven spars in total. 'To come and do a job like this is phenomenal. To pick up two injuries in the competition as well and still win, I feel very proud of myself. 'Honestly, I can't believe what I came through. Two weeks before the competition, I was doubting myself. I was sparring an Australian kid and I should have been destroying him but it was close. I felt very nervous, but as soon as I got in the village and settled, I knew no-one was beating me.' Never in doubt: Barnes produced a controlled performance to defeat the classy Laishram . Conlan added: 'I thought I won the first round but I heard I lost it so I knew I had to change my tactics and push him back a bit more. It worked for me in the end. He's a talented boxer but I knew I had the heart and drive to beat him.' Joe Fitzpatrick had to settle for a silver medal after being clearly outpointed by busy Scot Charlie Flynn in the lightweight final. And 21-year-old Michaela Walsh also took silver despite giving a good account of herself against England's Olympic gold medallist Nicola Adams in the women's flyweight division, dropping the narrowest of split decisions on the judges' cards. Walsh said: 'I wanted it more and I feel in my heart that I won it but she's the Olympic champion and she was going to win it if it was close. 'But my coach knows and I know and she will know if she watches the fight again that I got it. 'Today is the start of my career. I came here for the gold and in my heart I know I got the gold medal. But I proved I am up at that level and I really believe that fight was mine.'","The Northern Irishman beat India's Devendro Laishram .

"By . Rose Parker . Nearly a quarter of young Australian men are now obese and the impact on their health is similar to premature ageing, new research has revealed. A team at Deakin University's IMPACT Strategic Research Centre studied 2,500 men and women aged 20 to 96, using whole body scans to accurately assess fat and obesity levels. They concluded that 24 per cent of young men in the 20 to 29 age group were obese - a significant rise on the previous estimate which was just eight per cent. Researchers say that the huge discrepancy is due to problems with the Body Mass Index (BMI), which does not distinguish between different body shapes. Crisis: Around 24 per cent of Australian men aged 20 to 29 are now overweight, new research has revealed . Professor Julie Pasco, deputy director of the IMPACT Strategic Research Centre and Head of the Epi-Centre for Healthy Ageing, said that the problem was particularly acute when assessing men. 'While we found BMI-based estimates for obesity in most women were fairly accurate, the use of the BMI markedly underestimated the amount of body fat in young men aged 20-29,' she said. 'The fat to weight ratio appears to be disproportionately high in this group, which means many young men are carrying more fat, proportional to their weight, than expected. 'Global and Australian estimates of obesity have been based on Body Mass Index. Yet, as a measure of body weight for height, this technique doesn't account for different body types. 'It doesn't distinguish between fat, muscle or bone, which contribute to body weight differently for men and women, and for different age groups.' Professor Pasco blamed an active lifestyle and poor diet for the trend and added that the effect on the body left younger men prone to problems that usually come with age. 'It means that an alarming number of young men are exhibiting the physical characteristics of older men, where muscle mass has been replaced by fat,' she said. 'This has particular implications for muscle weakness and potential osteoporosis later in life.' The number of people who are obese worldwide has nearly doubled over the last 30 years, with women bearing the brunt of the trend. Approximately one in three women and one in five men are obese - and an estimated two thirds of the adult population are either overweight or obese. BMI has been the medical standard of measuring weight for many years. However, research over the last few years - including the latest study - indicates that it is not the most accurate of assessments. 'We knew that the BMI overestimates obesity in muscular body builds and underestimates obesity in the elderly, but the underestimation of obesity in young men is a new finding', Professor Pasco said. 'We have an obesity epidemic on our hands. We need the most accurate information possible so that we can address this issue and encourage people to improve their diet and lifestyle.'","24 per cent of Australian men aged 20 to 29 are now classed as obese .

"By . Darren Boyle . Plans to extend a riverside hotel in historic Cambridge have been rejected for a third time - following a campaign spearheaded by Stephen Hawking. The Double Tree by Hilton had its plans to build 31 extra bedrooms and a new leisure centre rejected last year, following a similar idea turned down in 2010. The latest scheme for the hotel, which sits on Sheep's Green and Coe Fen by the river Cam in Cambridge, involved building a fourth floor to one block, providing 16 new rooms. Prof Stephen Hawking, pictured, campaigned against the proposed hotel extension in Cambridge . Developers wanted to extend the hotel by an additional 31 bedrooms to the Double Tree Hotel, pictured . However, planners rejected the expansion plans, which campaigners claimed would, according to this artist's impression would reduce the amount of river frontage available to members of the public . Ability Hotels, which owns the Doubletree, said they planned to then convert the hotel's leisure centre into 13 bedrooms, while retaining a small gym. But it has already been recommended by planning officers at Cambridgeshire County Council that the plans should be rejected. Members of the public voiced concerns about the potential loss of leisure facilities, commenting these are 'well used' and that the new design is 'unattractive'. Campaigners including the A Brief History of Time author and comedian Griff Rhys Jones argued that a new build would ruin the historic view of Cambridge University. Cllr Sian Reid said: 'I am delighted this application is being recommended for refusal by council officers. The loss of the leisure club would be a loss for the community.' Jane Singleton, chairman of the Resident's Association of Old Newnham which led the campaign against the first two applications, said she was absolutely 'delighted'. She said: 'There are so many grounds for refusal, including taking away the leisure centre from over 700 Cambridge residents. 'Damage is being done to a particularly unique and beautiful area of Cambridge.' Thirty-seven mothers who take their children to swim in the pool signed a petition against the move. Protesters were able to defeat a third planning application despite developers altering their designs . But designer Mark Savin, of Bury St Edmunds-based MLT Architects, said at the time the proposals would have no impact on views from Sheep's Green and Coe Fen - a key issue in previous refusals. He said: 'We have endeavoured to take on board the previous comments made by both the committee and the appeal officer and we have looked to address them in a constructive and sensitive fashion with revised proposals.' The proposals would also get rid of a large and visually prominent glazed pyramid for a transition to a single storey structure - something which English Heritage welcomed. When it launched its third application, the hotel argued removing the leisure centre's pyramidal roof would help the development to blend in. Hotel officials said the expansion was needed because it was running at 'maximum capacity' - but the plan was rejected anyway. Owners of the Double Tree Hote said they need the extension as they are 'running at maximum capacity .","Prof Hawking led protesters against the controversial hotel in Cambridge .

"Peter Kennaugh won the British Cycling National Championships road race, capping off a dominant Team Sky display by out-sprinting team-mate Ben Swift to win in Abergavenny. The pair surged clear with two laps to go and Kennaugh timed his sprint finish to perfection, using Swift's slipstream and then overhauling his team-mate at the death to take the victory by less than bicycle wheel in south-east Wales. Orica-GreenEdge rider Simon Yates, who had fought valiantly to remain in contention despite Team Sky's numbers in the leading pack, came home third, one minute and eight seconds behind the leading pair.

He said: '(It's) amazing. The last lap when I was with Swifty it's hard to race against such a good mate and play those tactics (with him) sitting on me for the whole of the last lap. 'Once I tried my luck with the attacks and the climbs and he was still with me, I thought it was game over. 'But I knew the sprint from 2009 when Kristian House beat me, I took it up really early and I knew that maybe with the last 200m downhill I stood a bit of a chance so I remained positive, gave it my best shot and when I was coming round to the line I couldn't believe it, it felt surreal.'

"By . Kiran Chug . When my father cuts the grass, leaving neat parallel lines up and down the lawn, his two-year-old grandson — my son Milin — follows him with his toy mower. Wherever Papa is, so too is his little shadow — copying, watching, unconsciously learning new skills from the grandfather he adores. Milin can count up to 12: he has learned this with the gentle guidance of my father, a retired accountant, who bought him his first book of numbers. Scroll down for video . Three generations of love: Kiran, Tony, Milin and Jasmin with Kiran’s selfless parents . My mother, a retired chemistry teacher, possesses similar patience. She has the capacity to distract my one-year-old daughter Jasmin with a puzzle or a picture book while spooning food into her mouth that she will not eat for me. I had not realised just how valuable my own parents’ presence in my children’s lives would be until I moved back home with them — and brought my husband and two children with me. I now appreciate the wonder of grandparents: they know how to quell an infant tantrum, how to cajole a reluctant baby into eating. This is because they have experience and wisdom. After all, they’ve practised with their own children. Like so many 30 and 40-somethings, financial constraints mean my husband and I cannot yet afford a home in modern-day Britain. So, 18 months ago, we moved back in with my parents. And the experience has taught me so much that I’m not sure we are in a hurry to leave. Why? Nine years ago, my husband Tony and I decided to start a new life in New Zealand. For some years it was wonderful, but after my first baby, my heart began to ache with longing for my parents. When they visited I was entranced by the way their smiling eyes would lock with my baby son’s. My mother had an amazing knack of soothing Milin. When he cried, she’d scoop him up and he’d instantly relax in her arms. I had left my childhood home in Finchley, north London at 19 intending to forge my own path. I didn’t for a moment see myself returning to live with my parents again 15 years later, along with my own family. But life doesn’t ever go to plan. If it did, the four of us would be making a home of our own, with Tony and I scratching our children’s heights on a door frame door. Instead, we have joined the boomerang generation. We are back in the neat, four-bedroom, suburban semi where my parents raised my sister, Josleen, 31, and I. And we’re not the only ones. Figures from the Office of National Statistics recently revealed that in 2013, more than 3.3 million adults in the UK aged between 20 and 34 — 26 per cent of this age group — were living with their parents, because of the economic downturn. This was almost 667,000 more than in 1996, the first year such figures were available. Kiran and Tony moved in with her parents after leaving New Zealand 18 months and have no plans to move out . So, how did Tony and I end up back home? I had read English Literature at Edinburgh University and while living there I met Tony, a graphic designer from New Zealand. After graduating, Tony and I moved to his home country. Property was a third of the price it was in the UK capital, so for the cost of a two-bed flat in a dreary London suburb we could live in a spacious house with a garden. Our careers flourished. I was working for a national newspaper, while Tony had a children’s book published and he’d become a freelance designer and illustrator. In November 2010, a few months before we married, we bought a home in Wellington for £250,000. When Milin was born in December 2011, he made our house a home, I concluded. And yet when he turned one, and we had another baby on the way, the pull of my family in Britain had become wrenching. Tony’s parents are divorced and lived too far away to visit regularly. My parents had been to stay with us twice in Milin’s first six months. When it came for them to go back to London my heart almost broke. The attraction of a life in England close to my mum and dad was stronger than the lure of our comfortable lifestyle in New Zealand. Duly, in January 2013, we moved back with only the sketch-iest of plans. There was one thing we were sure about, though — we’d stay with my mum and dad until we found our feet. That was 18 months ago, and we are still no closer to having a home of our own. Perhaps we will be ready to leave in a year. We do not really know. Yet even as I contemplate leaving my parents, I feel ambivalent. If I do find work, if we find a home, we will still rely on them for childcare. Without their help, we would be paying full-time nursery fees, making a home once again unaffordable. But more than that, my parents’ constant presence in their grandchildren’s lives has enriched them immeasurably. Almost three-quarter of a million British families have three or more generations living under one roof. The other day Milin announced he knew his right hand from his left — ‘Papa taught me!’ And when he recites his numbers, and I watch my father’s proud smile, my heart does a little leap of joy. Yet there are times when I feel, though my parents make no complaint, that we must have tried their patience. They should be enjoying their empty nest. I look at the children’s playroom and know it should be used for entertaining. I look at the garden which we have converted into a mini obstacle course. We’ve taken the bedrooms on the first floor, and my parents had to retreat to the converted loft to sleep. My parents are unfailingly tolerant, and despite the chaos, my mum has only once implored me to tidy up the children’s mess. Caring for two young children is a young person’s job, so I know mum and dad must get tired, especially as the energy of a two-year-old boy is inexhaustible. ‘Let’s play football, Nanni,’ Milin will often beg, and my mother will dutifully spend the whole morning kicking a ball to and fro. After, I’ll beg her to go upstairs for a rest and she will insist she is ok. But their energy does not flag. If Tony is not home in time for bedtime, Mum will improvise a story for Milin, who listens entranced. Yet while I am moved beyond words by the bond between my children and my parents, I desperately wish we were making memories in our own home. Kiran claims two-year-old Milin (right) and one-year-old Jasmin (left) have learnt a lot from their grandparents . One day, our little family will have its own place. But from shared-living, I’ve learned that having the people you love around you when you are bringing up babies is immeasurably wonderful. And Milin and Jasmin have gained most. I watch their daily interaction with their grandparents. I see my dad teaching Milin how to play golf in the garden, I watch my mother rock Jasmin to sleep in her arms. Such inter-generational living is the norm in some families in my Punjabi culture, although it wasn’t a way of life my parents or I ever intended for ourselves. But it has enriched us all. When I was exhausted after sleepless nights with a teething toddler, my mother was there to help. When Tony and I have looked at each other in despair, my father has been there quietly supportive, proffering advice if we needed it. My parents’ magnanimity and generosity is humbling, and I am constantly amazed by the depth of their selflessness. But Papa is 68 and my mother, 63. They should be downsizing to somewhere quiet and taking frequent holidays and entertaining friends for lunch and supper. Tony and I miss our privacy and independence. We are sad, from time to time, about how life is. But we are also hopeful. And above all, we are supremely, boundlessly grateful.

Australian sprinter Sally Pearson has shrugged off the weight of a tumultuous week at the Commonwealth Games by winning back-to-back gold in her pet track event the 100m hurdles. Pearson won gold in 12.67s - quicker again than her semi final win - to defeat rival Tiffany Porter who ran 12.80, with Canada's Angela Whyte bronze in 13.02 on a day where Australia hauled in four gold. A jubilant Pearson, who had stayed silent on the sacking of coach Eric Hollingswoth earlier in the week, made a statement louder than any words could when she flew home in the final before celebrating with fans post-race. The 27-year-old capped off not only a personal milestone but a big day for Australians generally with four athletes bagging golds on day nine. Rookie high jumper Eleanor Patterson, discus thrower Dani Samuels and diver Matthew Mitcham also made their statements on the world stage. Pearson edged out her rival Tiffany Porter who ran a time of 12.80s in second place . It is back-to-back gold for Pearson in her pet event the 100m hurdles . Mitcham broke through to win his first Commonwealth Gold after six attempts, while discus thrower  Dani Samuels lived up to her favourites’ tag with a dominant win in the women’s event. She threw  64.88m, almost 3m ahead of her nearest competitor. Rookie high jumper, Eleanor Patterson, 18, produced a big effort to win gold in the women’s high jump final with a jump of 1.94m . Australian Hannah Joye, who was also competing in the final, finished sixth with a personal best of 1.89 metres. But the day belonged to Pearson, who put all the controversy of her troubled relationship with Hollingsworth behind her when he was sacked for comments he made earlier in the week. He had said that Pearson set a bad example to younger athletes by not appearing at the team camp in Gateshead last week.

Australia's Matthew Mitcham (front) and Domonic Bedggood won gold in the men's Synchronised 10m Platform final . It is Mitcham's first gold medal win in six attempts at the Commonwealth Games . Athletics Australia released a statement condemning Hollingsworth for the fact he said anything, for what he said about Pearson in particular, and for the timing of what he said. When asked how she put the sensational sacking of her coach behind her and remain so calm in the build-up to the final, Pearson said she reverted to simple tactics. 'I’ve done this a million times before. I know how to win, I know how to race. It’s just another day at the office,' she told Channel 10. 'It’s just another 100 metres with 10 hurdles in the way.

"By . Damien Gayle . Tragic: Kamaljit Sidhu leapt from a motorway bridge after her former partner put her through an ordeal of stalking and harassment, a court heard . The mother of a woman who leapt from a motorway bridge has condemned her daughter's stalking ex-lover for 'putting her through hell'. Ryan Dey, 23, refused to accept that Kamaljit Sidhu wanted to end their 18-month relationship and made threats towards her and her friends. He was arrested soon after Miss Sidhu jumped from a bridge over the M6 last autumn, and today he was jailed for two years after admitting stalking the 29-year-old. Passing sentence, a judge told how Dey had threatened to tell Miss Sidhu's family she had an abortion and that he had once beaten her up. Miss Sidhu's grieving mother Sarbjit Sidhu said 'evil' Dey put her daughter through an ordeal of 'control and abuse' in the weeks before she fell to her death. 'Does Ryan Dey really realise the damage he has inflicted on my beloved Kam, me and my family?' she asked in a statement released after the hearing today. 'We will never forget our baby Kam, I was unable to see her for the last time when she was put to rest and that has been difficult to deal with. 'Ryan Dey is evil, he is a bully and a coward and had put my daughter through hell with his control and abuse and will never be forgiven for what he has caused. 'As a mother and a family we want the world to know this can never be allowed to happen again, I do not want anyone else to go through what we have. Our lives have stopped and we can't breathe.' She added: 'The police asked is there anything we can do, Mrs Sidhu, and my only answer to them was can you please give me my daughter back, we really miss her, her death has left a big hole in our lives.' Miss Sidhu, who was known to loved ones as Kammi, leapt to her death last October from a bridge over the M6 near to Great Barr in the West Midlands, where she lived with her family. In the weeks leading up to her death, Birmingham Crown Court heard, she had been hounded by Dey, a lorry driver from Oldbury, who had refused to accept that she had put an end to their relationship. He made threats towards her, contacted her friends and had searched various locations in Birmingham, where she worked, trying to find her. She went on to make comments on social media telling friends that she was afraid of Dey in the lead up to her death. 'He put my daughter through hell': Ryan Dey, left, was arrested soon after Miss Sidhu, right, jumped from a bridge over the M6 last autumn, and today he was jailed for two years after admitting stalking the 29-year-old . Judge Michael Chambers said: 'You had been in a relationship with Kam for the previous 18 months notwithstanding the other relationship you were in. 'You did not like her seeing or socialising with anybody else. You did not even like it when she was seeing friends in her own home. 'She sought to end the relationship but instead of accepting it you started persistently harassing her. 'It led her to becoming very frightened. You even hacked into her Facebook system and sent messages to her friends pretending to be her. 'She was living at home with her parents and you called their land line at all times of night and day. You repeatedly went to the address and waited outside.' The court heard that on the night before Miss Sidhu's death, she had been out at a bar with friends following a job interview in Birmingham. But her 'demeanour changed dramatically' when she spotted Dey in the same bar with two men, leading her to drop down on all fours and hide from him. 'She continued the evening with her friends and she ended up on motorway bridge having been drinking,' the judge said. 'A message was written by her on a moisturiser bottle and said: ""I loved you all. I just got weak. Sorry.""' Afraid: The court heard that on the night before Miss Sidhu's death, she had been out with friends in Birmingham. When Dey arrived at the bar with two men she dropped down on all fours to hide from him . Miss Sidhu jumped to her death at 4.30am on October 25, hours after the incident in the bar. 'I'm satisfied that you did or said something to her that made her very frightened,' said Judge Chambers. 'Coupled with the background plus whatever had caused her to be so frightened of her significant factor which caused her to fall off that bridge. 'I'm satisfied she did take her life and you were a factor in that. 'What you did or communicate will never be known but from police interviews we know you threatened you would disclose to her family she had had an abortion and at least on one occasion you had beaten her up. 'She was a much loved and liked young woman with her life before her. Those close to her should understand any sentence does not reflect or measure the loss of a loved one.' Dey was arrested a month after Miss Sidhu's death and charged with harrassment and stalking. Prosecutor Peter Grieves-Smith told the court that on the night she spotted him while out drinking in Birmingham she had already told her parents that he had been in touch with her and that if he called the house not to tell him where she was. Dey began calling the Sidhus repeatedly, leading them to disconnect their phone. 'They did not wish to speak to him,' the prosecutor said. 'But the effects of that meant when the victim tried to call her parents later that night she couldn't get through.' 'Much loved and liked': The court heard that Dey repeatedly hacked into Miss Sidhu's Facebook account, sending abusive messages to her friends . Friends who were out with Miss Sidhu that evening got the impression that she was on edge, said Mr Grieves-Smith. 'The effect of what he did by coming to the bar that night was that she was terrified. The victim continued to hide and eventually she returned looking distressed,' he said. 'That night she left the bar after she was satisfied he was gone and she was given a lift by a friend. It was not long after she was dropped off she fell from the motorway bridge. 'Something had occurred to make her manifestly scared. We might never know what that was.' The court heard Dey sent a string of threatening messages to Miss Sidhu on Facebook just hours before she died. Mr Grieves-Smith added: 'It was clear that one of the Facebook entries from the defendant at 1.30am that night said ""I'm going to f*** you up"". 'He repeatedly hacked into her Facebook account and could see who she was communicating with and what she was doing. 'A Facebook message on October 23 at 6.21am from the victim's account to a friend asked ""What do you think about orgies and threesomes"". 'The message had been sent from the defendant who had hacked into the account. 'The victim's friend told police the defendant had said ""You stupid bitch I will tell your family all of the f***ed up shit you have done."" 'He also took her mobile phone and the purpose of doing so was control. 'Bit by bit it as time proceeded it got worse and had led to the moment of the early hours of October 25 when she died.' Dey was sentenced to two years in prison at Birmingham Crown Court after avoiding a trial by admitting stalking and causing serious alarm or distress at a hearing last month. Following the sentencing today, detective chief inspector Kim Madill, from West Midlands Police Public Protection Unit, said: 'This has been a difficult, challenging and deeply upsetting case to investigate for all concerned. 'The investigation team has worked tirelessly to try and find some justice for Kamaljit and her family, following her tragic and untimely death. 'One can only imagine the fear and torment that Dey must have put her through to take such a course of action. 'Even though this conviction cannot bring Kamaljit back, hopefully the fact that Dey has admitted his crimes and is now facing a spell in prison will come as some comfort to her grieving family.'","Kamaljit Sidhu was 'put through hell' by ex-partner who stalked her .

"By . Sara Malm . A Norwegian man has shown that his love for cheeseburgers and McFlurries goes further than most people after tattooing in a McDonald’s receipt on his arm. Stian Ytterdahl, 18, from Lørenskog, southwest Norway, was told by his friends that he had been 'too active on the ladies front' and as punishment had to get a tattoo. His Monday night dinner is now forever etched on his right arm, but the student says it could have been worse - the alternative was a Barbie doll on his buttocks. Scroll down for video . 'Punishment': Stian Ytterdahl, 18, had been a little too successful with the ladies for his friends' liking and was ordered to tattoo the receipt from his trip to McDonald's . ‘Some of my mates thought I had been a bit too active on the ladies front recently and wanted to punish me. 'When we were in the restaurant on Monday, they said I had to tattoo a Barbie doll on my bum, or the receipt on my arm,’ Mr Ytterdahl told Romerikes Blad. The student’s first ever tattoo now covers most of his lower right arm, and unsurprisingly his parents are not best pleased. ‘I got an email from my dad that wasn’t entirely positive, saying “What on earth have you done?! Do you think you are coming home with that!? Your mother has had a break down”,’ Mr Ytterdahl told Expressen. Eternal memory: The teenager's tattoo shows time and date of his visit on Monday night, as well as the franchise's address and phone number . McFan: Although his friends have applauded his new tattoo, his parents are less than pleased and his mother 'broke down' when she saw the tattoo in the local newspaper . Burger or Barbie: The receipt for three cheeseburgers, a happy meal, a coke and a McFlurry was the lesser of two evils, Mr Ytterdahl says, as the alternative was tattooing a Barbie doll on his bum . The artist at Sabelink Tattoo raised an eyebrow, but carried out the task, posting the result on Facebook captioned ‘my strangest tattoo so far’. The image has been shared 230 times and has more than 1,000 likes, but despite the unusual motif, Mr Ytterdahl has no regrets. ‘It’s funny to think that I have a tattoo which no one else even has the likes of. Even the date and time is on it,’ he says. Mr Ytterdahl says Sabelink Tattoo has offered to ink the receipt of the tattoo of the receipt on his other arm for free. Hooked: The 18-year-old from Lorenskog says this first tattoo will not be his last, after the studio that did it offered to ink their own receipt on to his left arm for no extra cost . Mr Ytterdahl's dinner on Monday night, now forever etched onto his skin: . 1 x 0.5litre Coke3 x Cheeseburgers1 x Cheeseburger Happy Meal1 x McFlurry NonStop, with three extra toppings1 x Extra Happy Meal toy . Mr Ytterdahl has said yes and is booked in to get his second tattoo done next week. ‘I might not find it as funny when I am 50 or 60 years old, but it’s my choice.’ McDonald’s Norway has denied that it is a PR stunt, saying they have never heard anything like it before. ‘This is clearly a loyal customer,’ McDonald’s Norway told Romerikes Blad. Mr Ytterdahl says he has no problem being seen as a walking advertising board. 'I might even get a job at McDonald's now,' he joked.","Stian Ytterdahl tattooed the receipt from his McDonald's visit .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The FBI never conducted an investigation about a reported crash of several flying saucers in New Mexico detailed in a memo 63 years ago - which is now believed to have been an elaborate hoax. The memo from Guy Hottel, the special agent in charge of the Washington field office in 1950, was released publicly via the FBI's website in April 2011. Of all the agency's documents that have been made public on its website, the so-called 'Hottel memo' is by far the most popular, with nearly a million views. Popular: Of all the agency's documents that have been made public on its website, the so-called 'Hottel memo' is the most viewed, with nearly a million hits . But as the FBI admits in a blog post appearing on its website, agents never took a second look into the bizarre report. In the memo, whose subject line is 'Flying Saucers', Agent Hottel says that an Air Force investigator had stated that 'three so-called flying saucers had been recovered in New Mexico.' The investigator gave the information to a special agent, he said. The FBI blurred out the names of both the agent and the investigator's identity. Agent Hottel went on to write: 'They were described as being circular in shape with raised centers, approximately 50 feet in diameter. 'Each one was occupied by three bodies of human shape but only 3 feet tall,' he stated. The truth is out there: Roswell became infamous after reports that a flying saucer had crashed in the desert near a military base there in 1947 . The bodies were 'dressed in a metallic cloth of a very fine texture. Each body was bandaged in a manner similar to the blackout suits used by speed flyers and test pilots.' Despite the elaborate description, the Hottel memo has been exposed as nothing more than misinformation provided by a scam artist named Silas Newtwon, NBC News reported. Above Top Secret honcho Mark Allin told the network: 'The memo is based on a hoax that was carried out by a convicted con man named Silas Newton, and it was debunked years ago. 'It's a pretty good and interesting hoax story, to be certain, but there is no value in it beyond that.' Agent Hottel said that the informant claimed the saucers had been found in New Mexico 'due to the fact that the Government has a very high-powered radar set-up in that area and it is believed the radar interferes with the controlling mechanism of the saucers'. He then stated that the special agent did not attempt to investigate further. The FBI writes in its blog that Director J. Edgar Hoover authorized agents to verify the existence of flying saucers at the request of the Air Force. It adds: 'That practice ended in July 1950, four months after the Hottel memo, suggesting that our Washington Field Office didn’t think enough of that flying saucer story to look into it.' The blog goes on: 'The Hottel memo does not prove the existence of UFOs; it is simply a second- or third-hand claim that we never investigated.' Agent Hottel died in 1990. The town of Roswell in New Mexico became infamous after reports that a flying saucer had crashed in the desert near a military base there on or around July 2, 1947. The bodies of aliens were said to have been recovered and autopsied by the U.S. military, but American authorities have been accused of covering the incident up.

"By . Andy Newport, Press Association . Darren Burnett completed a golden day for Scotland at Kelvingrove as he defeated Canada's Ryan Bester 21-9 to win the men's singles at the Commonwealth Games. His victory followed Alex Marshall, Paul Foster, David Peacock and Neil Spiers' triumph earlier in the day after the home nation beat Auld Enemy England 16-8 in the fours final. The Scots had waited eight years for a Commonwealth gold medal before Marshall and Foster won the pairs event on Monday but Burnett's victory after 19 ends means they close out Glasgow 2014 with three - their best result since 1994. Victory: Scotland's Darren Burnett won gold for Scotland in the men's singles bowls at Kelvingrove . The Arbroath policeman was given special dispensation to take part in the Games after Police Scotland cancelled all leave for officers across the country for the duration of the event. Now the 38-year-old world indoor champion hopes his latest victory will earn him some more time off. 'It feels great to have won this title,' Burnett said. 'It's been a whirlwind year after winning the indoor championship too. 'The whole of the police have been behind me 100 per cent, it's been great. There's a lot of officers around the place right now and if they didn't know I was a policeman before, most of them know now. 'As you come through the security gates you get the old 'You better win' sort of thing off them. 'I'm due to go back to work next week some time. My immediate boss said I might get an extra day off if I won the gold, so I'll hold him to that.' Burnett brought down the curtain on the bowls programme with a high quality display. But he had to fight back after a slow start allowed Bester to edge 3-0 up early on. The Scot pulled one back in the fourth end, before a remarkable four in the fifth and a three in the next put him in control. After slipping 14-7 behind, Bester managed to claw back a couple of shots but Burnett pulled clear again with a three in the 16th after his rival's wild drive sent his bowls flying in all directions. And he wrapped up a comfortable win with four shots in the last three ends. Meanwhile, Australian Aron Sherriff eased past Shannon McIlroy of New Zealand with a 21-8 victory to claim the bronze.

"By . Jack Doyle . House of Commons Speaker John Bercow faced calls for an official inquiry last night over why he gave a Parliamentary pass to a friend of his wife – who later donated thousands of pounds to his re-election campaign. Wealthy businesswoman Farah Sassoon was given the pass – which allows full unescorted access to the Palace of Westminster – two years ago. She is a friend and drinking partner of Mr Berow’s wife, Sally, and was pictured cavorting in the back of a taxi with Mrs Bercow last year. House of Commons Speaker John Bercow is facing calls for an official inquiry into why he gave a Parliamentary pass to a friend of his wife - who later donated thousands of pounds to his re-election campaign . Mrs Sassoon’s company, Trust Reservations, has also donated £5,000 to Mr Bercow’ s 2015 campaign in his Buckingham seat. The donation this year from the conference and hotel booking company became public when Mr Bercow lodged it in the official register of MPs' interests. Last night former Tory Party vice chairman Michael Fabricant said: ‘I’m sure the Speaker would welcome an inquiry in to this matter in order to clear his name.’ And former Transport Minister Simon Burns said: ‘I do not quite see why at the request of the wife of the Speaker a friend should be given a pass to the House of Commons – in that they are not usually given to MPs’ friends. ‘It makes it look rather difficult for the Speaker when he then receives a rather nice cheque for his elelction campaign – and leaves him open to criticism and questions.’ Details of the donation to Mr Bercow’s election campaign emerged over the weekend. Farah Sassoon, who is a friend and drinking partner of Sally Bercow (pictured together above after an awards ceremony last year), has donated £5,000 to Mr Bercow’ s 2015 campaign in his Buckingham seat . Then, on Tuesday, the Tory MP for Reading East, Rob Wilson, wrote to the Speaker asking him a series of questions about the pass and demanding ‘transparency’. In a statement, the Speaker’s office confirmed Mrs Bercow applied for a pass for a ‘female friend’ in 2012. A spokesman said it was ‘not unusual for residents living on the parliamentary estate to be able to apply for passes for close friends and family’. She pointed out that Mrs Sassoon’s donation was made on June 7 2014, and that it was accepted three weeks’ later. However, the statement did not address the question lodged by Mr Wilson of whether Mr Bercow consulted with the Parliamentary authorities – including the Clerk of the Commons - on the ‘propriety’ of accepting a donation having issued the pass. John Bercow with  wife Sally outside Westminster . A parliamentary pass gives the holder full access to the high-security Palace of Westminster estate. Passes are given to MPs, their aides and journalists and staff who work in the Commons and the Lords. They allow the holder to wander unaccompanied around the estate and eat and drink in its restaurants and bars. Anyone applying for one must go through extensive security checks. Mrs Sassoon came to public attention last year when she was pictured draping her leg across Mrs Bercow's lap in a cab while the pair were on a night out after awards ceremony for gay magazine Attitude at the Royal Courts of Justice. Mrs Sassoon is married to hotelier Peter Sassoon Munns, and her daughter Sophia is an actress and model who starred in the reality TV show Made In Chelsea. She is listed as a director of Trust Reservations, and has donated more than £40,000 to Labour, including £4,200 to Ed Miliband's leadership campaign in 2010. In his letter to the Speaker, Mr Wilson said he was raising concerns highlighted by several constituents. He wrote: 'Integrity, accountability and openness, are part of the seven Nolan Principles of Public Life which are enshrined into Parliament by their inclusion in the Code of Conduct for MPs.' Mr Wilson also raised the prospect of writing to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards about the issue.","John Bercow is under fire for giving a Parliamentary pass to his wife's friend .

"By . Mike Dawes . Andy Powell is back with the wife who spray painted 'cheat' across his car and house as she reveals she is carrying his baby and says 'we still love each other'. Natasha Gascoine branded the Wales and former British Lions player a 'liar, cheat and a scumbag' when their marriage failed after just nine months amid allegations he had cheated on her; Powell was labelled 'scrumbag' by tabloid newspapers earlier this year. She also posted screengrabs of his sexually explicit texts to her on Twitter, and put the 32-year-old's rugby gear for sale on eBay, along with her wedding dress. Not happy: Ex-Lions man Powell's wife posted his lewd text messages online as the pair suffered a spat . Over so soon: Gascoine split up with Powell in February - just nine months after the pair tied the knot . Pleads: Gascoine says that Powell sent these texts to her in a bid to rekindle their marriage . Happier times: The 25-year-old posted this picture while on away in Cyprus back in December . Reconciliation: But Gascoine has taken back Powell and the couple are expecting a baby . However, Gascoine, 25, has confirmed that after . three miscarriages she is pregnant again - and Powell is the father. The pair started divorce proceedings in March and Gascoine told friends they were ending their brief marriage amicably. But it became very amicable - the pair kissed and made up and told their family and friends they still have a future together. 'Andy was ringing me and texting me and I ignored it but a a few weeks after we thought: ""We'll put everything behind us and move forward"",' she said. 'He said he didn't want us to get divorced. We still love each other, there is no doubt about that. 'It took me a while to accept because I was still really angry. 'He said he would do various things to make it up to me and we'd get back on track and see each other here and there and now I'm pregnant again.' The couple marked their first wedding anniversary at the Celtic Manor golf resort in Newport where the held their reception a year ago. 'We have spent most of the year living apart so it hasn't been much of a marriage,' she said. 'But we are both determined to give it another go - we have to forget about some of the things we did and said to each other and move on.' After returning from a holiday to Dubai with a female friend, Gascoine announced she is pregnant for the fourth time in just over a year. She tweeted at the weekend: 'Coming back from Dubai & I have found out I'm pregnant for the fourth time in almost a year,' she wrote, posting a photograph of her positive pregnancy test.' Just two months ago the pair were in . the middle of a very public break-up over Powell's alleged infidelity, . drinking and gambling. Gascoine . was 17 weeks pregnant at the time and left devastated when she lost the . baby at the beginning of April, even though she and Powell had split. The pair had argued very publicly via Twitter, and the row included 6ft 4in Powell bizarrely posting a naked picture of himself. Anger: Gascoine branded him a 'liar, cheat and a scumbag' when their marriage failed after just nine months . Update: After a trip to Dubai Gascoine took to Twitter to reveal that she was pregnant with Powell's baby . She then sprayed the words 'scumbag' and cheat over his house and pink Mercedes, and even went onto eBay to sell her £10,000 engagement ring, wedding ring, jewellery, dress and the gifts the pair received on the big day. She wrote on the auction website: 'The sentimental value has gone and to be honest since being married to him I have realised how fake he really is. And what a great let down he has been.' Office . worker Gascoine gave the proceeds of her clear out to Women's Aid . and Samaritans - charities she describes as 'close to her heart. She . said at the time: 'I don't think Andy Powell knows who he really is, . he's built a character to fool everyone who knows him and I fell for it. 'I . wouldn't want anyone else going through what I have been through, I've . been holding up my wedding dress, thinking of the future we had planned - . destroyed.' Split: Their public break-up was bitter, with Powell at one points bizarrely posting a naked photograph . Back row forward Powell responded by saying he hated her and 'could never forgive her'. Powell played for the . Cardiff Blues, Wasps and Sale Sharks during his union career, before . crossing codes to play rugby league for the Wigan Warriors. But his move ended after just five games for Wigan when he picked up a neck injury, and he was released by the club in January. He won 23 caps for Wales, and toured South Africa with the British and Irish Lions in 2009. But he was also known for his off-field problems. In 2011 was suspended after getting embroiled in a bar brawl with football fans. In 2010 he was banned from driving for 15 months and fined £1,000 for driving the . stolen cart along the hard shoulder of the M4 to 'get some munchies' from a service station at 5.30 in the morning. Powell moved back in with his parents in his hometown of Brecon, Powys, after the break-up and Gascoine revealed they are still not living together. She is staying with her parents at their country home in Monmouthshire while Powell gets his life back on track. 'He is still drinking but he has given up gambling which is an improvement,' she said. 'But he chose to go on a golfing holiday with his mates rather than come to Dubai with me. 'He's . able to go on trips while I'm at home stressing and worried and feeling . really anxious. I'm just hanging onto his word all the time. 'Unless . he was to get his career back on track, or some kind of job, I think . he's always going to be distracted. He knows a lot of people, he likes . to socialise.' Roll up! Gascoine put a number of Powell's possessions up for auction on eBay . Powell and Gascoine are due to have the first scan of their baby later this week. She said: 'We are both excited but I am very worried. I have lost the previous three, I don't want it to happen again.' Gascoine admitted she still has 'trust issues' with Powell but insists he has never been attracted to rugby groupies throwing themselves at him. 'I have heard from a few good friends that he's had women sitting on his lap and he's been pushing them away,' she said. 'He'll even leave a club, because he's never liked women pestering him. 'If he was to react back on that and I found out about that then obviously I would be concerned.' Powell was unavailable to comment on getting back with his wife.","Gascoine branded sportsman a 'scumbag' when marriage failed .

"By . Associated Press . A small plane crashed in a San Diego shopping center parking lot on Wednesday, killing an 80-year-old woman who was the lone passenger and injuring the pilot, authorities said. The single-engine 1988 Mooney M-20L went down around 5:30 p.m. in a parking lot that serves a Costco and a Target store in the Kearny Mesa neighborhood. The plane bounced while landing at nearby Montgomery Field, continued westbound and went down, said Ian Gregor, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration. Scroll down for video . Wrecked: San Diego police examine the wreckage of a small plane in the parking lot of shopping center on Wednesday . However, helicopter pilot Vince Carter said he had taken off from the field when he heard the pilot, in apparently her last radio transmission, tell the control tower that she had lost power on takeoff. 'She said she lost power and she was going down and that was it,' he told KFMB-TV. There was no immediate way to resolve the two reports. The plane clipped the top of the Target store and knocked down a light pole, police Lt. Steve Behrendt said. It spun around and finally landed in the parking lot in a loading dock area away from the main entrances, and no cars were there, city fire spokesman Lee Swanson said. The plane caught fire, but the flames were quickly doused. He said the passenger had serious burns and died at a hospital. The pilot, a 52-year-old woman, also had major injuries, he said. However, Behrendt said the injured woman was expected to survive.

He said 15 to 20 people were standing around the plane, some with fire extinguishers, and they managed to get the fire out before it reached the plane's fuel tank.

"By . Martha De Lacey . Frances Marques produces a clear plastic jar containing a fleshy orange blob suspended in pickling juice and presents it to the camera. 'This is my labia,' she says nonchalantly. 'I think she looks better in the jar than hanging down there.' Frances is just one of the female stars of Plastic Wives, TLC's  controversial new American reality TV show taking a closer peek at the lives of the women married to some of LA's most successful cosmetic surgeons - all of whom have made it their life's work to reap the free perks of the spousal scalpel. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . 'This is my labia': Frances Marques has had several cosmetic procedures including a nose-job, several breast implants and vaginal rejuvenation surgery . Best pals: Frances Marques with her ex-husband Dr Ryan Stanton, who continues to operate on her for free . Ms Marques was married to Dr Ryan Stanton for seven years before 'he . got the mid-life crisis' and left her for a younger woman, but the two remain friends and she continues to enjoy the freebies he happily provides her with, and even help him run the surgery she co-owns with him. The Brazilian national, who lives in Beverley Hills, told ABC News she has had plastic surgery 'from here to my camel toe', including a couple of breast augmentations, a nose job and vaginal rejuvenation procedure, the operation which led to the 'leftover' bits of labia she keeps at home in a medical jar as as 'keepsake'. 'My boobs, my nose....what else?': Frances Marques talks through the procedures she has undergone at the hands of her ex-husband, Dr Ryan Stanton, to whom she was married for seven years . Smelling of roses: Frances Marques is filmed taking a bath filled with champagne and rose petals . But Ms Marques - who at one point in the series throws a party at which all the guests are given free Botox - denies the surgery has made her or her friends look too artificial, saying: 'They are calling us plastic wives, but we don't look overdone.' But she admits that her desire to alter her appearance has become something of an obsession: 'I am . kind of addicted, I go there every day to the clinic. 'There are so many . new things coming, so many new technologies, new implants, new Botox, . new filler, laser procedures and all that, and I want it all.' Happier times: Frances Marques and her ex-husband Dr Ryan Stanton on their wedding day - the couple divorced seven years later . 'It's become an addiction': Frances Marques admits her fondness for surgical freebies has got a little out of hand . One of Ms Marques' co-stars is . Veronica Matlock, the wife of Dr David Matlock, who is shown on TV . receiving the 'G-shot' - an injection into her G-spot - from the husband . she calls The Vagina Man. The procedure was her fourth anniversary . present. At a dinner party Dr Matlock tells guests an anecdote in which a former patient bumps into him in the street and comes over to say hello. He says: 'I said to her, ""Darling, I don't recognise faces"".' Also featured on the . show is Dayna Devon, a former Extra TV presenter married to plastic . surgeon Dr Brent Moelleken, who is filmed being operated on by her husband. She said: 'In any other community in the world it makes no sense, but it's Hollywood. 'I wanted to continue working . television, unfortunately you hit forty you want to contiue working in . TV there are some things you gotta think about. I wasn't ready to hang it up yet, I wanted to extend my shelf life a a little bit.'

Plastic Wives documents - with . unfettered access to the operating room - the obsessive nature of . plastic surgery, and how that obsession can get completely out of hand . when people are provided with free procedures. Even the husbands of the . 'plastic wives' say they feel powerless to stop them demanding work. The . women admit that their husbands aren't always supportive of their . ever-expanding cosmetic surgery resumes, but this doesn't stop them. Veronica Matlock explained: 'One way to . get exactly what I want is to say, ""alright, don't worry about it, I'll go . to doctor so-and-so,"" and he'll be like, ""oh, no you don't!"".' Under the knife: Danya Devon prepares to be operated on by her husband Dr Brent Moelleken . Marital perks? Dayna Devon mid-procedure . Mrs Devon says she doesn't regret any of the surgeries she has had. 'I'm . happy now,' she said. 'I mean don't get me wrong, I still obsess about . an acne scar or something, but I think most woman do find things that . they obsess about.' Dr Lisa Casselith, a plastic surgeon who says she spends her days correcting procedures that have gone too far, says: 'It's our job to say ""no, you look abnormal, you can not have more."" You . have to hold that patient back. 'For purely selfish reasons, I don't . want a patient with giant lips sitting in my waiting room showing my other . patients this is what I do,' she admitted. 'The . insider phrase is 'Beverly Hills', so . when people come in and they are over-done, I say to them, ""I'm sorry, . you're looking too Beverly Hills."" And that's when you stop.' Ms Devon, who says the group of . Plastic Wives will not talk to wives of surgeons they don't like, added: . 'I heard some good advice a long time ago. If you're looking for a . plastic surgeon, look at his wife. And that's a perfect example of the . work he most likely does.'

"By . Richard Shears . The final desperate hours of rock star Michael Hutchence were revealed yesterday by the two detectives who investigated his death. Before he hanged himself in his hotel room in Sydney in November  1997, Hutchence had been rummaging through a bin, desperate to  find drugs, they said. In the same bin, they found the lyrics of the last song he wrote – which have never been published. Battle: The detectives tell how the singer, pictured left with Paula Yates and their daughter Tiger Lily, was pushed to a state of self-destruction during a bitter custody battle with between Yates and Bob Geldof, right . Traumatic: Paula Yates, they claim, drank a bottle of vodka when she arrived at the Ritz-Carlton after he died . They also told of the despair of his . girlfriend, Paula Yates, and her very public insistence that Hutchence . had died accidentally during a sex game. Former . detective inspectors Mark Smith and Michael Gerondis spoke out publicly . for the first time amid controversy in Australia over a two-part TV . film about Hutchence’s band, INXS, shown over the weekend and criticised . as inaccurate by his family. The . 37-year-old singer killed himself at the height of a bitter custody row . over Miss Yates’s children with her husband Bob Geldof. The . two Australian detectives told how they found evidence of a troubled . man on the path to self-destruction. Hutchence’s fingers were dark with . nicotine stains and he had an old cigarette burn so deep that it exposed . the bone, they said. ‘The . cigarette went right through his fingers and it was sort of infected,’ Mr Gerondis told Sydney’s Sunday Telegraph newspaper. The . officers said there were signs that Hutchence had been trying to  find . drugs before he died. The singer had even rifled through a bin. ‘He was . trying to get some cocaine but he did not get it so he was going through . the bin,’ said Mr Gerondis. It was at 11.50am the next day  that a hotel maid found the singer who had hanged himself. ‘The . maid could not get in because he was behind the door,’ said Mr Gerondis. Family: Paula Yates, Michael Hutchence and their daughter, Tiger Lily (left). He remained close to Miss Yates and her other daughters, Pixie and Peaches (right), over the years ahead of the international custody fight . Hell-bent on self-destruction: Michael Hutchence hunted for cocaine in the bin before penning his final lyrics then  took his life on November 22, 1997. He left nothing in his will for the family he fought with . Coroner . Derrick Hand later ruled that Hutchence had committed suicide in a . depressed state of mind while affected by drugs – a mind that was also . tormented by the battle over custody of Miss Yates’s children. The legal . fight meant that Hutchence’s own daughter with her, 16-month-old Tiger . Lily, was not going to be able to visit him in Australia that Christmas. Discovered: The maid found the singer's body at 11.50am. She pushed the door and he fell from behind it . Miss . Yates never accepted the ruling that Hutchence had committed suicide, . claiming in a TV interview that he had died during an auto-erotic sex . game. Such was her . determination to make her point about this to police that when she . arrived in Australia following his death she shouted at the detectives . in a restaurant while giving graphic details of the sex games she and . Hutchence played. ‘He would strangle me during sex,’ she told them. ‘She was shouting at us, everyone was listening in, and I thought “How embarrassing is this?”,’ Mr Gerondis told the newspaper. Mr Smith said Miss Yates went ‘berserk’, drinking a bottle of vodka at a luxury apartment she had checked into. ‘It was a circus getting her in and out,’ said Mr Gerondis. ‘We could not talk to her for a while because she was so upset.’ Mr . Smith said nothing would convince Miss Yates that Hutchence had taken . his own life. ‘She was just adamant that she wanted her child growing up . believing that it was an accidental death by auto-eroticism, instead of . the fact that he killed himself because he wanted to see his child,’ he . said. The two police . officers said they were convinced that it was an argument with Geldof on . the phone that day that had resulted in him plunging into depression. Mr . Gerondis said the row and the involvement of drugs meant that ‘nothing . was working’ for Hutchence that night. He rang his agent and said: ‘I’ve . had enough.’ The singer’s . devastated family asked police to hand over personal items collected . from the hotel room, including the partially-written song. But it all . went to the executor of Hutchence’s will, Hong Kong accountant Colin . Diamond, and it is unknown what happened to the song. Hutchence’s family . received no money from his estate. Miss Yates died of a heroin overdose in 2000. Geldof has brought up Tiger Lily along with their other three daughters. Band: The INXS frontman, here with the band, is believed to have scraped through a bin in search of cocaine during his final hours before penning his last lyrics. It is not know what happened to that song .","Inspectors describe state of singer's room at harbourside Ritz-Carlton hotel .

"By . Darren Boyle . A pensioner took his mobility scooter for a perilous trip when he was filmed going the wrong way down the hard shoulder on the motorway. Shocked motorists spotted the 85-year-old  man heading south on the northbound carriageway of the M1 in South Yorkshire. The man, who escaped without injury, was escorted from the scene by a police motorcyclist who slowed down traffic to prevent a possible accident. Scroll down for video . The unnamed pensioner was travelling southbound along the northbound carriageway of the M1 in his mobility scooter after making his way onto the busy motorway just south of Rotherham in Yorkshire . Steve Saxon was a passenger in a lorry heading north when he took out his camera phone and filmed the incident from the cab. Mr Saxon, owner of Pontefract-based S. E. Saxon Transport, said: 'I've been driving lorries since 1986 and I don't think I've ever seen anything quite as bizarre as that. I don't think I ever will again.' He continued: 'I don't know where he thought he was off to, but he clearly hadn't got there yet. He had no shopping in his basket. 'It was hilarious at first. We were gobsmacked and I couldn't stop laughing and then I realised it wasn't actually that funny. 'The traffic slowed down and we saw him being taken off by a police motorbike. 'How he managed to get on there in the first place I don't know!' Police slowed down traffic to prevent an accident as they escorted the pensioner to safety . He added: 'The chap must have been in his late 70s or 80s. 'He was steering with one hand and looked completely unfazed. We just keep watching it back and laughing to ourselves.' A police spokeswoman confirmed that the force had received a number of calls about the 85-year-old mobility scooter rider's progress down the hard shoulder and said that his family had been contacted following the incident. Andy Foster, who delivers mobility scooter training at South Yorkshire Polices Lifewise Centre at Hellaby, is pushing for obligatory training for anyone who buys a mobility scooter. The safety expert, who recently featured in the BBC television series The Trouble With Mobility Scooters, said: 'Very few people that ride mobility scooters have any knowledge of the laws of the roads. 'They don't need to hold a driving licence or have insurance. This man needs to thank his lucky stars he was stopped when he did.'

"By . Daniel Miller . You wait years for a decent sighting of the legendary ape-like creature known as Bigfoot, and then two come along at once. The fascinating photographs, taken just two weeks ago near Bradford, Pennsylvania, appear to show a pair of Bigfoots, or perhaps that should be Bigfeet, wandering through the trees. Keen hiker John Stoneman claims he spotted the seven-foot-tall beasts just yards from a main road through trees in Kinzua State Park. Two beasts: Stoneman claimed this image, taken just two weeks ago near Bradford, Pennsylvania, showed two of the mysterious creatures known as Bigfoot wandering through the woods . Is it Bigfoot? John Stoneman's close up photo, pictured, apparently shows one of the 'beasts' spotted just yards from a main road through trees in Kinzua State Park . Lurking: The photographs were taken by keen hiker John Stoneman who was on his way home with his girlfriend from a festival with his girlfriend when the pair spotted the mysterious shape moving in the forest . Mr Stoneman, 57, had been returning . from the Kinzua Bridge Fall Festival with his girlfriend when the pair . saw the mysterious shape moving in the forest. He quickly grabbed his camera and fired off these shots as they slowed the car down and edged along the road. Traffic . backing-up behind his vehicle forced John to move on but not before he . got what he believes is some of the best evidence yet of the existence . of the legendary North American creature. Debate: Stoneman's photographs fueled the debate on whether the legendary creature actually exists . Mr Stoneman, from Bradford, PA, said: 'I'm a sceptic myself, I'm not a believer, but this was not a bear and you can see fur on it. 'It's . wider at the shoulders and tapers down whereas a bear is bigger in the . middle and stands differently with its paws out, this was standing like a . man, like a Bigfoot. 'At first some people have . discredited it and said it's just a root ball at the bottom of a fallen . tree, but I've been back to the exact spot and there is no root ball . there. 'We do have black bears, but they are considerably smaller than this, it was standing about seven-foot tall.' The day before the sighting John said there had been a 'Bigfoot calling contest' organised as part of the bridge festival - an event held annually in the area to commemorate an old viaduct destroyed by a tornado. He said: ""This was 200 yards from the road, it was too narrow for me to be able to pull over without stopping traffic but I got as many pictures as I could. 'I actually dropped the camera casing so I couldn't see what I had got until I got home and put them on my computer, I was surprised at what I saw. 'I looks more like a bigfoot than anything else, I've already had organisations asking me to send them copies for verification.' Mr Stoneman - who is a member of the local outdoor pursuits group Allegheny Outdoor Adventures - said he had never seen anything like it in the woods before. Location: Outdoorsman John Stoneman, pictured, said he was previously a skeptic but the strange 'creature' convinced him . The quiet spot where the two 'bigfoots' were seen. Photographer John Stoneman fired off several shots. He said he was 'surprised' when he arrived home and saw the pictures close up . He said: 'This area is known for . Bigfoot sightings but this is the first time I have seen anything like . this, I am in the woods every week, I hunt and go hiking. 'I went back to the exact spot where it had been and there was nothing there, just years and years of leaves on the floor.' It . comes as researchers told a new conference in Texas that they have . proof Big foot is real and have even collected DNA samples. The Sasquatch Genome Project has spent $500,000 on collecting data and evidence over the past five years. Bigfoot, also known as sasquatch, is the name given to an ape-like creature that some people believe inhabits forests, mainly in the Pacific Northwest region of North America. Bigfoot is usually described as a large, hairy, bipedal humanoid. In 1951 American Eric Shipton photographed what he described as a Yeti footprint beginning a spate of 'sightings' and print finds throughout the 20th and 21st century.","Woodsman spots what appears to be two creatures lurking in the woods .

"By . Wills Robinson . A video has emerged of police standing and ignoring pro-life activists as a protester tear down their posters and walks off. The footage shows officers in Jackson, Mississippi, doing nothing as the man walks off with the  graphic signs depicting the aftermath of abortion. Despite complaints from the group, the officers allow the man to steal the display from right in front of them. Scroll down for video . Doing nothing: The footage shows a man picking up a pro-life demonstrator's sign in Jackson, Mississippi, as an officer watches . Hiding away: The man then take the signs down to a basement below a store . 'We got a guy taking our signs and walking with them right now,' an individual can be seen telling officers in the video, posted by The Blaze. While another says: 'He’s just taking our signs and putting them in his basement'. At another point, one man asks: 'Are you gonna allow someone to just walk away with our property?' The officer admits that he is watching, but lets the man carry on. Jackson Police Department have not commented on the issue but, according to pro-life organzation Created Equal, the man in the video has been charged. Earlier this year, Mississippi Governor Phil Byrant said his goal was to 'end abortion'. The state has lower abortion rates than the rest of the country and only has one  clinic, the Jackson Women's Health Organization. Footage: A cameraman continues to the protester as he takes the sign from the street . Alerted: One of the demonstrators goes over to an officer to tell him the signs are being taken away . Escorts in fluorescent yellow vests walk patients from the parking lot to the clinic, often as music blares from a boom box to drown out the protesters' voices. This means 99 per cent of Mississippi women do not have access to the service. A law currently being debated in the state that would give doctors admitting privileges to local hospitals is threatening abortion laws and could close the lone clinic. Members of a different three-judge 5th Circuit panel noted that the changes could force women seeking abortions to travel to other states. On February 27, 2006, the state’s House Public Health Committee voted to approve a ban on abortion. But the died after the House and Senate failed to agree on compromise legislation . In 2011, voters rejected an anti-abortion initiative that would have defined life as starting at conception. It would have also outlawed abortion and many forms of birth control.

"By . James Tozer . Two councillors who failed to pay their council tax have been granted anonymity – because naming and shaming them in court would violate their human rights. The pair owe a total of £4,660 but a senior judge said unmasking them risks causing ‘unnecessary and unjustified damage and distress’. Campaigners yesterday condemned the ruling as evidence of a worrying culture of secrecy – saying the public must know the identity of elected politicians who don’t pay the tax they help to set. Failure to pay: Two councillors from Bolton Council (pictured) failed to pay a total of £4,660 in council tax. But they have been granted anonymity - because naming them in court would violate their human rights . The councillors, one Labour and one . Conservative, had been summoned to court in Bolton and arranged to pay . their arrears in full for the periods 2011/12 and 2012/13. While their names would have been given on the day of the hearings, the cases were not reported at the time. The matter only came to light last . year when local newspaper the Bolton News made a Freedom of Information . request to Bolton council. But when the Labour-controlled . authority refused to identify the duo, citing data protection laws, the . paper complained to the . Criticism: Andy Silvester (pictured), of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said Bolton taxpayers would find the judge's ruling 'thoroughly depressing' The newspaper argued that there was a . strong public interest in disclosing the pair’s names as both could . have been standing for re-election in May. In his ruling, the commissioner said . it was ‘reasonable’ for someone in elected office to expect that failure . to pay would be made public. But he added that council tax was a . ‘private matter’ between residents and the local authority, and said the . personal circumstances given by the councillors as mitigating factors . were such that naming them would be ‘unfair’. A First-tier Tribunal, which hears appeals against the decisions of public bodies, later backed the anonymity ruling. Unusually, the council’s lawyers even asked if they could contribute to the decision-making process. In a written judgment, Judge Robin . Callender Smith said the circumstances of the councillors’ cases put . them in a position where they could ‘significantly and legitimately have . expected not to be named’. Citing the European Convention of . Human Rights, he added: ‘Releasing the information could potentially . cause unnecessary and unjustified damage and distress to the . individuals.’ There are now no further appeal . stages available, so the councillors’ identity will remain a secret. While their mitigation has not been disclosed, personal information . covered under data protection laws includes confidential medical issues. Andy Silvester, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, blasted a lack of ‘transparency and accountability’, adding: . ‘Bolton taxpayers will find this whole episode thoroughly depressing. Those who have paid their fair share deserve to know which of their . councillors aren’t doing the same.’ Councillors in Bolton receive a basic . annual allowance of £11,082, with additional payments for chairing . committees or cabinet duties. Christine Melsom, of anti-council tax . campaign group Is It Fair?, said: ‘When they’re getting allowances of . more than £11,000 a year, the least people can expect is for them to pay . on time.’ Bolton Council declined to say . whether the pair were among the two councillors who lost their seats in . May’s elections. It also refused to say how much it spent fighting the . case. But it said the tribunal ruling was correct, adding: ‘We take our responsibility to protect personal data very seriously.’ The ICO said the decision struck the ‘right balance between openness and accountability and personal privacy rights’.","Councillors from Bolton Council failed to pay total of £4,660 in council tax .

"By . Mail Online Reporter . A retired army nurse is facing a council tax hike of £1,000 a year after inspectors ruled her property is actually two distinct homes. Nerys Davies will now get two monthly bills after her four-bedroom house in Cerrgydrudion, Conwy, was judged to be 'two self-contained units'. Miss Davies, who served with the Army for 26 years, called the decision 'absolutely shocking'. But inspectors have held firm and dismissed her attempt to appeal. Scroll down for video . Nerys Davies outside her four-bedroomed property - now officially two separate homes for tax purposes . The 56-year-old has only paid one bill to the council since she bought the house and its annex, which she uses as a utility room, 20 years ago. But now inspectors have told her that this 'granny flat' section of her property could potentially be used as another home and ought to be billed accordingly. That means she will have to cough up the cash for lots of council tax, amounting to £2,500 a year, when previously she paid between £1,500 and £1,800 for a single property. 'It’s absolutely shocking because I’ve owned this house since 1995 and I’ve always paid my council tax,' she said. 'The extension was built well before I moved in here and now all of a sudden I’m being told it’s two separate houses. 'There’s only a flimsy door between the two so I don’t think a family would want to live in that tiny space if there was another family right next door. 'I used to pay around £1,600 to £1,800 tax as my house fell into the band F category. 'But now I’ve been told it will be split into two meaning it will be classified as a three-bedroom house and a one-bedroom flat under categories E and A.' Miss Davies in her utility room-cum-second home. The decision means she will pay an extra £1,000 a year tax . Council inspectors told Miss Davies that there was ‘no breach of planning control’ and that ‘nothing has been compromised’ at her property. She tried to reverse the decision but her appeal was dismissed at a valuations tribunal hearing, despite Valuations Office Agency officer David Taylor conceding it might not be possible to sell the building as two properties. Miss Davies said: 'The process was incredibly confusing and whenever I tried to ask questions I felt like I was being ignored. 'The council told me that I hadn’t broken any rules by having the cooker and utility facilities in the extension when they visited in January.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Created: . 11:02 EST, 5 December 2011 . A parish councillor known as 'Mr Good Evening' who bombarded late night DJ Iain Lee with hate messages over the phone, email and Twitter has been jailed. Samuel Wilkins, an Ofcom worker and village councillor in Whyteleafe, Surrey, subjected the comedian and his producer to a 16-month campaign of abuse and nuisance calls. Mr Wilkins, 33, who is also a children's charity trustee, sent Twitter messages calling Lee an 'ugly c**t' and a 'pathetic little p***k' and even made remarks about the DJ's young son. Campaign of abuse: Ofcom employee and village councillor Samuel Wilkins (left) has been jailed for eight weeks for subjecting radio DJ Iain Lee (right) to a 16-month campaign of nuisance calls, e-mails and Twitter messages . The councillor also emailed Lee three times a week and bombarded the DJ's late night phone-in on Absolute Radio with nuisance calls where he would introduce himself as 'Mr Good evening', in a high-pitched voice. He said Mr Lee had a 'disfigured face' and told his wife to 'do me a favour and kill your ugly husband so we don't have to listen to him anymore'. The defendant bombarded Iain Lee's Late Show with nuisance calls and emails for 16 months before his arrest last December. At the same time, he volunteered as a village councillor for Whyteleafe, Surrey, and a trustee for children's charity Tenderheart. Westminster Magistrates today jailed Wilkins for eight weeks after telling him his behaviour amounted to 'very serious' harassment. Also targeted: Wilkins said he hoped Mr Lee's radio show producer Eloise Carr (pictured) would have acid thrown in her face . Lee's radio show producer, Eloise Carr, broke down in tears as she told magistrates how Wilkins said he hoped she had acid thrown in her face. Passing sentence, presiding magistrate Yvonne Constance told Lee: 'We notice the absence of any remorse for these offences, which went on for a period of 16 months, and we have concerns they may be repeated. 'You were warned by the lawyers at the radio station to desist, yet you continued right through to December when finally these matters were brought to the attention of police.' Wilkins was sentenced to eight weeks jail but then released on bail pending an appeal. Mr Lee announced in October he was leaving the radio station 'to pursue other radio, live and TV projects.' At the time, he declined to comment on his departure or the ongoing court case. His show, which aired from 11pm - 1am, Monday to Thursday, invited listeners to call in about a range of topics. Wilkins was a regular caller who would announce himself as 'Mr Good Evening', the court heard. Giving evidence, Mr Lee said he was first contacted by the defendant when he was working at LBC radio four years ago. 'We received calls from a man that would just say 'good evening' in a very specific, high-pitched voice,' he told the court. Iain Lee . 'After I joined Absolute, we started receiving calls from the same person, it was the same voice and very little dialogue, just 'good evening' again. 'At first the calls were very repetitive but no problem. There was a brief pause but after a few months he continued calling from a withheld number. 'I let him come on the radio show and either he would hang up or I would cut him off. 'The phone calls started becoming a little bit too regular and getting a bit abusive. 'When Mr Good Evening was refused access to the show the calls started coming from a mobile phone with a different voice, but it was obvious it was the same person. 'They were starting to become angry, frustrated and obnoxious and when Eloise called the number back, the answerphone said Sam Wilkins. 'The calls were aggressive, demanding and seemed to imply a sense of entitlement that he should be on the show. 'Some shows he would call up to 10 times and there were a number of occasions when I told him to stop calling us on air. 'His reaction was sometimes to agree to stop calling, but sometimes he would refuse and say 'I will do what I want and I will keep calling if I want to'.' Former Absolute Radio DJ Mr Lee attending the Arqiva Commercial Radio Awards in London in June last year. He quit the station in October to pursue other projects . Wilkins also sent Mr Lee and Ms Carr at least three emails each week, the court heard. He asked if there were any jobs and described how he had 'the boss from hell' at Ofcom. Wilkins later asked for help after losing his job and expressing worries that his life would go down the pan. The emails, sent between November 2008 and May 2010, were from at least three addresses with the name Sam Wilkins, with one under the alias of Eileen French - Wilkins' grandmother. Another email claiming to be from Mr Lee was allegedly sent to BBC Breakfast by Wilkins saying he would like to move his show. The emails all ended with 'It's Goodbye from Mr Good Evening'. Mr Lee described the correspondence as 'weird', saying: 'I find it odd that someone I don't know is sending me messages about their life and I thought, 'this is getting weird now'. 'He was constantly telling me about the sadness and emptiness of his life and I felt uncomfortable.' During the trial defence barrister Joanna Hardy suggested Mr Lee 'goaded' Wilkins, who she described as 'vulnerable', and encouraged him to call the show. Wilkins, of Godstone Road, Whyteleafe, Surrey, was found guilty of two charges of harassment without violence.","Councillor called DJ an 'ugly c**t' and 'pathetic little p***k'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . With a globe of light illuminating each wingtip, and a fierce tongue of fire spouting from beneath, this hovering aircraft has been compared to an extraterrestrial visitor. It is the latest test of the high-tech warplane that the U.S. and its allies are funding to maintain the West's aerial dominance far into the 21st century. A video shows the Lockheed Martin F-35B Lightning II making its first night landing at sea, using its vertical landing capabilities to gently touch down on the deck of the USS Wasp. Scroll down for video . Eerie: The lights and jet of the F-35B Joint Strike appear to glow green as seen through a night-vision camera . The F-35B appears to hang stationary above the deck of the USS Wasp, in this flight test filmed on August 24 . The high-tech jet lowers toward to flight deck, in a test the pilot said went 'extremely well' The F-35B Lightning is the short take-off/vertical landing (STOVL) variant of the radar-evading Joint Strike Fighter - a collaborative development funded by the U.S. and eight of its major allies. The jet combines advanced stealth features with fighter speed and agility, with its STOVL capabilities enabling it to operate from a wider range of ships. The landing shown in the video was carried out by U.S. Marine Corps test pilot Lieutenant Colonel C.R. 'Jimi' Clift, a Harrier pilot by training. 'It all went extremely well,' he said. 'Eight successful landings in one night, so we’re tracking favorably along the learning curve.' During the 18-day long ship trials, which began on August 14, two F-35Bs were to conduct a series of tests to determine the aircraft’s suitability for sea-based operations. They also included the first take-off and landing at sea by an RAF test pilot, Squadron Leader Jim Schofield, with the UK earmarking £250billion for a fleet of the jets due to be in operation by 2018. Squadron Leader Schofield said: 'It's exciting to see the integration of this new plane with the amphibious assault ships. 'After . a year leading up to this evolution, it's awesome to get here and . start. And the crew has been especially accommodating and efficient at . running these tests smoothly' Take-off: During the 18-day long ship trials, which began on August 14, two F-35Bs were to conduct a series of tests to determine the aircraft¿s suitability for sea-based operations . The movable afterburner at the rear of theF-35B means it is also able to take off from very short runways . Captain Erik Etz, Director of Test . & Evaluation for the F-35 Naval Variants, added: 'It's a significant . milestone for the F-35 programme. 'We're . providing an envelope that will be utilised by Marine Corps and U.K. aviators when they go out and employ the aircraft in a real environment. February 19: All F-35s grounded after crack found on low pressure turbine blade of Air Force variant warplane . January 16: Marine Corps' F-35B suspended for nearly one month after single engine failed during test flight in Florida . January, 2012: Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta took Marine Corps version of warplane off probation . August, 2011: Flight and ground operations suspended after electrical problems on Air Force aircraft . March, 2011: Fleet grounded after dual generator failure on Air Force test aircraft . January, 2011: Then Defense Secretary Robert Gates placed probation on warplane threatening to cancel fighter jet unless costs and problems were sorted within two years . 'The ability to operate at night is critical and so certainly the testing we're doing here will provide a significant amount of data so we can clear the envelope and clear the aircraft to operate day and night, when the Marine Corps takes the F-35B to initial operating capability in 2015.' Success in the latest round of tests is crucial in a weapons development programme which has been dogged with technical problems and demands on the Pentagon to slash costs. After a year of pressure to revise its estimate of maintaining a fleet of more than 2,000 F-35s over 55 years, the agency finally caved in by slashing the number by more than 20 per cent, a move that could boost international support for the programme. The new estimate of $857billion could help ensure the new plane turns out to be as affordable as advertised. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter is the costliest weapons program in U.S. history. The Pentagon estimates it will cost $392billion to develop and build 2,443 of the new jets for use by the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps. Lockheed is developing three models of the radar-evading warplane for the U.S. and eight countries that are helping fund its development: Britain, Australia, Canada, Norway, Turkey, Italy, Denmark and the Netherlands.

"If T-Pain was from Hyderabad, he might sound a little like Vennu Mallesh. The Indian singer has become an Internet sensation in the West after users discovered one of his videos and spread it across social networks. The general consensus is that it is awful. So awful, in fact, that it's amazing. But having racked up in excess of 4.2million views, Mr Mallesh is probably laughing along with his critics - and all the way to the bank. It's My Life: Vannu Mallesh sings in the video which has made him a worldwide musical sensation . Viral: Mr Mallesh's YouTube video has racked up more than 4million views since it was published in 2012 . Heartfelt: The 29-year-old singer says he was inspired to write the song by his life experiences . The song, It's My Life (What Ever I Wanna Do), is a fairly catchy piece of Auto-Tune pop, in the style of early Lil Wayne, which Mr Mallesh, 29, describes as 'a non-fictional, psychological and philosophical song written by me’. In the song's description on YouTube, he goes on: 'My Life inspired me to write the lyrics, lyrics inspired me to compose tune, lyrics and tune inspired me to Sing. That's what the actual happened to the ""Born of the Song"". 'The words I penned for the lyrics of the Song are genuinely written from the bottom of My Heart which describes about ""My Attitude"".' The heartfelt slice of pop has been panned by critics, both professional and amateur. Reporting on its going viral, a writer for India TV News described it as both 'torturous' and 'unmelodious'. 'Be assured the video is not being popularized due to his singing but instead for his audacity to sing,' the reporter sniped. YouTube commenters have not been any more charitable towards Mr Mallesh's efforts. 'He is one s*** singer,' remarked one user on the video sharing site. Another wrote: 'You sir have the most retarded songs/voice I've ever heard.' Brain eater? Some of the phrases used in Mr Mallesh's song do not translate well to Western audiences . Having fun in the studio: Mr Mallesh sites with producers as they lay down the music for his track . Indeed, it does appear from the undoubtedly heartfelt lyrics that English is not Mr Mallesh's mother tongue. 'People think I am somewhat mental / They don't know I am very sentimental,' he sings. 'Friend of mine says I am a waste fellow / He don't know the taste of this fellow.' But Mr Mallesh has taken a philosphical attitude towards the haters - or 'hell wishers' as he dubs them. A post on his Twitter account about all the attention It's My Life has attracted reads: 'My Hell Wishers helped to make this... 'My Well Wishers helped to make it as Hit... 'My Fans helped to make it a Super Hit... 'Now everyone helped in making it as a Sensation...' Indeed, with YouTube reportedly paying video contributors as between $2.50 and $5 per thousand views, that means that Mr Mallesh may have made at least $10,000 from It's My Life. And that can go a long way in Hyderabad.","Vennu Mallesh's song It's My Life has had more than 4million YouTube views .

"By . Mike Dawes . St Helens' Australian scrum-half Luke Walsh has been ruled out for four to five months with a broken leg. The 27-year-old spent two nights in hospital after sustaining the injury in the first half of last Friday's 44-22 win over Widnes and has already undergone surgery. Although Walsh's first season in Super League has been cut short, the injury was not as serious as initially feared. Down and out: Australian scrum-half Walsh will miss the next four of five months after undergoing surgery . 'He's basically snapped his fibula,' St Helens coach Nathan Brown said. 'He's had surgery with the plate and bolts and all the type of things that go in and he'll be out for four or five months. 'It was as good a result as you could expect. It could have been worse.' The loss of Walsh is still a body blow to the Super League leaders, who are just two points ahead of Leeds going into the last five games of the regular season. Brown has the option of switching skipper Paul Wellens into a playmaking role, especially with former Hull full-back Shannon McDonnell available to make his debut, but he is set to start Friday's game at Hull with Jordan Turner and Gary Wheeler after they finished the Widnes match at half-back. 'At the moment that would appear to be our best, most stable, option,' Brown said. 'They both played there last week. Gary has played a number of games earlier in the year in that position and Jordan has filled in a couple of times this year and done a great job. He's also played there a number of times for Hull.'","Australian underwent surgery after suffering the injury in Friday's victory .

Eight minutes later Mason Caton-Brown enhanced his growing reputation by getting round the right edge of Rovers' defence to score. Josh Griffin missed the conversion to leave the home side 6-4 in front. Back came Rovers with a Craig Hall try two minutes later. Rovers half-backs Kris Keating and Burns combined well to send Hall over for his fourth try in his last two home games. Burns added the conversion to give KR a 12-4 lead.

"By . Kate Gardiner, Press Association . England gymnast Max Whitlock believes the Commonwealth Games has proved just how quickly gymnastics is improving in Britain and is quietly confident that can translate into medals in October's World Championships. The 21-year-old double Olympic bronze medallist achieved his aim of claiming all-around gold in Glasgow by smashing through the much-vaunted 90-point barrier - the blue riband event for any gymnast - and now hopes to replicate his form in China later this year alongside the powerhouses of the host nation, Japan and the United States. Whitlock helped England to team gold while also winning the individual floor title, pommel horse silver and parallel bars bronze, four years on from competing at his first senior major competition at the 2010 Games in Delhi. Talented: Max Whitlock believes the Games has proved just how quickly gymnastics is improving in Britain . 'I'm over the moon. It's been an amazing competition and is one of my favourites by far,' Whitlock told said. 'It's just been an amazing experience and has put us in really good stead for the worlds coming up. We're really looking forward to it. 'Going from Delhi I feel like I've made a massive improvement and I've put in a lot of new skills and that's something I'm very pleased about and hopefully I can continue it. 'For this competition it was to hit the 90 mark and over (in the all-around) and I'm happy as I've done that twice here. Hopefully I just need to to get that as consistent as I can and if I go to worlds and get over 90 hopefully that will bring a good result but as I say it's what happens on the day.' One of the men Whitlock is set to face at the world championships is Japan's superstar gymnast Kohei Uchimura. The 25-year-old has won an unprecedented four successive world all-around titles and is widely regarded as the best male gymnast of all time. He is also Whitlock's idol. 'That guy is unbelieveable and he won't be beaten for a long time I think,' Whitlock said. 'I'm not looking at trying to beat Uchimura now, I'm looking to get the highest score I can and if I can come close to Uchimura I would be honoured. I would be absolutely honoured. 'I'd like to think I'm on his radar. I'd like to think he knows but that guy is one of a kind.' Silverware: Whitlock helped England to gold while also winning the individual floor title, pommel horse silver and parallel bars bronze . Olympic silver medallist Louis Smith's much-heralded return following a lengthy break from the sport slipped into the realm of sideshow as he could only claim bronze on the pommel horse behind Whitlock and gold medallist Dan Keatings. The 25-year-old is now returning to his media career to sit on the judging panel of new gymnastics entertainment show 'Tumble' but Whitlock thinks he could live up to his word of coming back for the 2015 World Championships in Glasgow ahead of a possible Olympic return in Rio. 'It all depends on the make-up of the team but if he's posting massive scores - if anyone is scoring massive scores - then they deserve to be in the team,' Whitlock said. 'It's very hard to have a long break, especially in gymnastics. The longer you have off, the longer it takes to get back into it. It will be a very hard job to do. 'But he's proved he can do it here. Pommel horse isn't the most demanding on the body so pommel horse is a good piece to do it on. He's proved he can bring it back, he's done a good routine but it's hard to say. We'll just have to wait and see.' All-rounder: Whitlock poses during the medal ceremony after winning gold in the men's all round final . With Smith out of the limelight until at least next year, it could be 18-year-old Nile Wilson who steps up alongside fit again Keatings, with the Leeds teenager proving he has what it takes to cut it at senior level after winning high bar gold alongside other impressive performances after only being crowned Junior European champion in May. 'It's getting stronger really quick and hopefully we can keep it up,' Whitlock said of Great Britain's strength. 'London 2012, that was our first team medal in 100 years and that was really unexpected. It's a big target of ours at the World Championships and it will be a really hard job to get a team medal but that's what we're pushing towards and it's one of our targets, it has to be.

"By . David Clough, Press Association . Stuart Broad senses a new beginning is under way for him and his England team-mates as they finally free themselves from the hangover of last winter's Ashes whitewash. Broad (three for 65) and James Anderson (three for 52) had to work especially hard to take six India wickets between them as the tourists closed day three of the third Investec Test on 323 for eight in reply to 569 for seven declared. But their deserved success, in batting conditions at the Ageas Bowl, is a prime indication to Broad - after some disappointing showings of late - that England are back on track. VIDEO Scroll down for Stuart Broad on England success of day three vs India . Turnaround: Stuart Broad celebrates taking the wicket of India's Murali Vijay on the third day . Where it's due: And Broad has credited the side's resurgence to England coach Peter Moores . A pep talk with coach Peter Moores appears to have done the trick for the pace bowler, who cited the return to form here of captain Alastair Cook and a big hundred from Ian Bell as further evidence that the talented core of England's team is firing again. 'I think maybe the (senior) players have put too much pressure on themselves - after what, since the Durham Test (last summer), has been a pretty tough run,' he said. 'Maybe we got a bit uptight. Before this Test match, Mooresy came to a few of us and said ""just go and express yourself - don't worry about having to take responsibility ... just go and play, like it's your first Test match."" I think that's shone through a little bit.' Cook and Bell, along with another century from new boy Gary Ballance, helped England pile up the runs before the bowlers got to work. 'Cookie and Belly played fantastically with the bat, and Jimmy and I have contributed with the ball,' added Broad. 'Everyone was having a laugh, and smiles on their faces, and I think that showed in our cricket. We kept the energy up throughout the whole day. We were brilliant.' Improvement: Every aspect of England's display has considerable improved at The Ageas Bowl . Reliable: And Jimmy Anderson was again at it taking three wickets so far . The defensive tactics England were forced to adopt for much of the winter have been hard to shake off for Broad. 'It was a bit of leaving the past behind, and just going and expressing yourself,' he said. 'Personally, I am an attacking cricketer - and maybe [had fallen] into a defensive mind-set. 'That was the chat I had with Mooresy, and it freed me up a little bit.' The upshot is that England have prospects here of a series-levelling victory. 'We're in a great position in this Test match. We hope the wicket, late day four (into) day five will deteriorate a little bit.' Although off-spinner Moeen Ali picked up two wickets from false shots, Broad insists England profited from their collective discipline and industry. 'We created enough pressure throughout the day. I think you saw that with Mo picking up the two wickets he did. You didn't feel like you could go too full ... so you had to bowl back of a length, and then risk one an over fuller. 'We did what we said we wanted to do this morning ... created pressure - and I think we got our rewards at the end of the day.' Positivity: And the mood has lifted considerably among the England players . Half-centuries from Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Ajinkya Rahane held England up, but Anderson and Broad still put themselves in elite company as only the third pair of pace bowlers to rack up 500 Test wickets in partnership - joining Pakistan's Waqar Younis and Wasim Akram, and West Indies' Courtney Walsh and Curtly Ambrose. Broad grew up marvelling at their deeds, and said: 'To go into the company of Wasim and Waqar and Courtney and Curtly is a huge honour - four heroes of mine growing up. 'I think it shows the value of partnerships as bowlers...Jimmy and I are constantly talking, not just out on the field but in nets together. Even now, we've played a lot of Test match cricket, I'll still ask Jimmy at the end of an over ""what shall I bowl?"" 'We work together really tightly. So to have got 500 wickets together is massive. I hope we can take a few more.' Rahane fell to neither, instead miscuing a pull at Moeen to midwicket. He said: 'I was really disappointed, the way I got out, because I was batting so well. We needed that one partnership to go on.' England, meanwhile, may still have the option of enforcing the follow-on - but not if the hard-worked Broad has any say in whether he gets a rest before trying to take another 10 wickets. 'I've not discussed it with Cookie, but if you're asking me it's 100% off limits,' he said.","Broad senses a new beginning is underway for England in third Test .

"By . David Kent . Arsenal have announced the signing of Colombia goalkeeper David Ospina from Nice on a long-term contract. The 25-year-old, who impressed as Colombia reached the quarter-finals of the World Cup in Brazil, has moved to the Emirates Stadium for an undisclosed fee. Gunners manager Arsene Wenger told Arsenal's official website: 'David Ospina is an excellent goalkeeper, with good experience and a proven record of performing with Nice and Colombia. 'He will add strength to our squad and we are very pleased that he will be joining us.' The 25-year-old joins the north London side on a reported four-year deal for £3.2million.

Shop window: David Ospina helped Colombia reach the quarter-finals of the World Cup in Brazil . Playing for keeps: David Ospina (L) will challenge Wojciech Szczesny to become Arsenal No 1 . Shortly after the announcement, Ospina posted a message on his Twitter account translated as: 'The race closes with a wonderful Nice cycle and a dream fulfilled upon arrival at Arsenal. Thank you Nissarts, Go Gunners'. The keeper is expected to make his first appearance for Arsenal during the Emirates Cup friendly tournament, which takes place in north London next weekend. Ospina made 189 Ligue 1 appearances over six years with Nice having joined the south coast club from Colombian club Atletico Nacional in 2008. He made his senior debut for Atletico aged just 17 and has been a full Colombia international since 2007, making his first start for Los Cafeteros in a 2010 World Cup qualification match against Bolivia. At Arsenal he will provide competition for first-choice keeper Wojciech Szczesny while helping to fill the gap left by the departed Lukasz Fabianski, who has joined Swansea. Nice coach Claude Puel on Saturday night confirmed Ospina's move to London had been ratified and told Gunners fans they could expect some 'quality' displays from the new signing. Speaking to Sky Sports News after Nice's friendly defeat to Brentford, Puel said: 'It's confirmed, yes. 'It's a good affair for Arsenal because he's a very good player. You will see next season the quality of this player. 'It's fantastic for him. It's important for him to try another league, another club and Arsenal is a fantastic club for him. 'David Ospina can take the goalkeeping position at Arsenal because his qualities are very strong and... 'magnifique'. You saw in the World Cup how important a goalkeeper he is. For me, David can impose his quality, he's a goalkeeper who is very good with the feet, with his arms, he knows football and he's a very, very good player.'

"By . Mario Ledwith . A passenger jet came within 300ft of colliding with an unidentified flying object, an official probe has heard. Despite an investigation, the UK Airprox Board – which examines reports of near misses – could not explain the ‘blue and yellow’  object which passed under the  Airbus 320. The incident happened on December 2 last year over Baillieston, 13 miles east of Glasgow Airport, at around 3500ft. Near miss: The Airbus A320 was under 10 seconds away from hitting the unidentified flying object as it approached Glasgow Airport . The shocked pilot reported the collision risk as ‘high’. The A320 was descending into Glasgow in clear conditions with the sun behind, when both the plane’s pilots saw an object around 100 yards away. The board’s report said: ‘The object passed directly beneath before either of the crew had time to take avoiding action or had “really registered it”, although they both agreed that it appeared blue and yellow (or silver) in colour and was “quite large” with a small frontal area. ‘The controller stated he was not talking to anyone else in that area and nothing was seen on radar.’ In its report, the board dismissed a variety of possible explanations. It said: ‘In the absence of a primary . radar return, it was unlikely that the untraced aircraft was a . fixed-wing or rotary-wing aircraft or man-carrying balloon. ‘It was considered that a meteorological balloon would be radar-significant and unlikely to be released in the area. Approach: The plane was 13 miles away from Glasgow Airport (pictured) when it came within seconds of colliding with the unidentified object . ‘A glider could not be discounted but it was felt unlikely that one would be operating in that area, due to the constrained airspace and the lack of thermal activity due to low temperature. ‘Similarly, the board considered that a hang-glider or para-motor would be radar significant and that conditions precluded them. ‘Members were unable to reach a conclusion as to a likely candidate for the conflicting aircraft. The pilot was clearly shocked and reported that there had been a 'high' risk of collision following the incident on December 2 last year. He told his control tower: 'We just had something pass underneath us quite close. Have you got anything on in our area.' They replied: 'Negative. We’ve got nothing on radar and we’re not talking to any traffic either' The unidentified flying object passed directly beneath the plane before either of the crew had a chance to take action to avoid it. Both pilots described the object as 'blue and yellow (or silver) in colour with a small frontal area but that it was ""bigger than a balloon"".' Near miss: A diagram in the report which shows the pilot's direction of travel and the unidentified object which is marked as 'CPA 1246' This is a transcript of what the A320 pilot told the control tower. A320: 'Glasgow Approach [A320 C/S]' Air Traffic Control: '[A320 C/S] pass your message' A320: 'Er yeah we just had something pass underneath us quite close and nothing on TCAS have you got anything on in our area' Control: 'Er negative er we’ve got nothing on er radar and we’re n-not talking to any traffic either' A320: 'Er not quite sure what it was but it definitely er quite large and it’s blue and yellow' Control: 'OK that’s understood er do you have a an estimate for the height' A320: 'Maybe er yeah we were probably about erm four hundred to five hundred feet above it so it’s probably about three and a half thousand feet. '…we seemed to only miss it by a couple of hundred feet it went directly beneath us … wherever we were when we called it in it was within about ten seconds . '… couldn’t tell what direction it was going but it went right underneath us”' Control: 'do you suspect it might have been a glider or something like that' A320: 'well maybe a microlight … it just looked too big for a balloon.” The airline involved has not been identified by the report authors. Several . companies fly in Airbus 320 planes from the airport and they can seat . up to 220 people - although the number of seats varies. The report authors said they had not been able to work out what the object was. They wrote: 'The controller stated . that he was not talking to anyone else in that area and that nothing was . seen on radar. Search action was taken with no result and the A320 . pilot stated his intention to file an Airprox. 'Additionally, a further detailed review . of individual radar sources did not yield any conclusive radar data . that matched the A320 pilot's description of the encounter. 'The Air Traffic Control unit's own . radar replay also showed no surveillance traces in the immediate . vicinity of the A320 at the time.' Once on the ground the A320 pilot gave a further description of the event to the Glasgow Aerodrome Controller. The . pilot said: 'We seemed to only miss it by a couple of hundred feet it . went directly beneath us - wherever we were when we called it in it was . within about ten seconds; couldn't tell what direction it was going but . it went right underneath us.' Asked if he thought it was a glider, the pilot replied: 'well maybe a microlight - it just looked too big for a balloon.' But the board ruled out any such aircraft and were baffled. 'The board initially considered likely . candidates for the untraced aircraft. The A320 crew had not been able to . assimilate any information regarding the form of the untraced aircraft . in the fleeting glimpse they had, reporting only a likely colour,' it . said. 'Members were of the opinion that, in the absence of a primary radar return, it was unlikely that the untraced aircraft was a fixed-wing or rotary-wing aircraft or man-carrying balloon. 'It was considered that a meteorological balloon would be radar significant and unlikely to be released in the area of the Airprox. 'A glider could not be discounted but it was felt unlikely that one would be operating in that area, both due to the constrained airspace and the lack of thermal activity due to the low temperature. 'Similarly, The board considered that a hang-glider or para-motor would be radar significant and that conditions precluded them, as they did para-gliders or parascenders. 'Members were unable to reach a conclusion as to a likely candidate for the conflicting aircraft and it was therefore felt that the Board had insufficient information to determine a cause or risk.'","Plane narrowly avoided the 'blue and yellow' object at 3,500ft .

"By . Kit Holden . As Mario Gotze's left-foot strike hit the back of the net in Rio de Janeiro, it was an end and a beginning. It was the end of a long wait for this group of players to finally crown their talent with a major trophy. It was the end of speculation that the golden generation might have been wasted. It was the beginning of what may well be a period of dominance. Joachim Low had predicted it even before the final. 'We have a future,' he said, 'we can play on top of the world for a few years yet.' He is almost certainly right. Of the team which beat Argentina at the Maracana, only Miroslav Klose will not be around for very much longer. Even he will not be a terrible loss for Germany. VIDEO Scroll down to watch World Champions Germany prepare for journey home . Champions: Germany won the World Cup after beating Argentina 1-0 at the Maracana on Sunday . Hero: Mario Gotze came off the bench to score the winner for Germany in extra-time in Rio de Janeiro . The 36-year-old has performed magnificently in a black and white shirt for over a decade, and with his 16 World Cup goals is already a living legend. But in truth, Klose has played only a secondary role for a while now. This team is built on youth. Age is not merely a number either. Those lining up to replace Klose are not only considerably younger, they also belong to a much more modern breed of attacker. Germany has a gliding false nine in Mario Götze, a poaching one in Thomas Mueller, and a incredibly quick one in Marco Reus. All of those three are 25 or younger, and their best years are yet to come. They are also only the tip of the iceberg in terms of the attacking talent Joachim Low is able to choose from. In the next few years, we will almost certainly see the rise of players like Kevin Volland and Andre Hahn, who were on the fringes of the preliminary squad this year, while Julian Draxler is becoming ever more established.

We are the champions: Germany's newspapers react to their team's triumph in Brazil . VIDEO Germany's team profile & qualifying highlights . In midfield, too, there is an almost endless supply of talent. The likes of Bastian Schweinsteiger, Sami Khedira and Toni Kroos all have years ahead of them, but already a wealth of experience behind them. Even if Schweinsteiger's fitness and age become a problem over the next few years, there are plenty of understudies waiting to fill his shoes. Max Meyer, Leon Goretzka and Liverpool's Emre Can are all capable of reaching the top of the international game, and Ilkay Gündogan should return to full fitness in the near future. Only in defence are there any long term problems for Germany. While young Dortmund left back Erik Durm will have gained invaluable experience as part of this World Cup squad, there are no truly remarkable young defensive talents emerging at the moment. Life: Mats Hummels (left), Mesut Ozil (centre) and Toni Kroos (right) are all still young with plenty to offer . Leader: German manager Joachim Low said the future is bright for his team, even before their win on Sunday . Nonetheless, Mats Hummels and Jerome Boateng are still young. Phillipp Lahm may be 30, but even he is showing no signs of stopping. Even beyond the current team, everything seems set for Low and his employers at the moment. In the last 10 to 15 years, German football has completely restructured itself. It is not just the FA, but the league and the clubs themselves. In the Bundesliga, the clubs who develop their own players are the successful ones. That is visible from the heights of Borussia Dortmund down to lowly Mainz, who have been punching above their weight for years due to a brilliant youth system which spawned, among others, Chelsea's Andre Schurrle. Nurtured: Andre Schurrle came through the ranks at Mainz and now plays for Chelsea . VIDEO Argentine fans in tears as Germany clinch title . As long as clubs like Mainz continue to play in a league which encourages that youth development, they will continue to produce top talents to represent Germany, and we will see many more golden generations. The main reason for this German team's success is not national pride or machine-like efficiency, as some in Britain continue to insist. The reason is that this young group of players has been allowed to thrive from a very young age. They have played together or against each other from a very young age. Even those who are under 25 now have an immense amount of experience. There is no reason to believe that won't be the case for the next German generation, and the next one, and the one after that.

"By . Sarah Dean . Steve Hooker has quit his duties as a commentator for host Commonwealth Games broadcaster Network Ten, after his athlete wife was banned for drug use. Middle-distance runner Katya Kostetskaya has been banned for two years by the World Anti-Doping Agency, with the news coming as a shock to the Australian pole vault champion who has since left Glasgow. Ten presenter Matt White announced on air on Thursday morning that Hooker wasn't aware of the information prior to it being logged on the agency's website and that he would return to Melbourne to be with his Russian-born wife. Despite losing their highly regarded athletics commentator, Ten were supportive of Hooker's decision to leave the Games early. Australian pole vaulter Steve Hooker's wife Ekaterina Kostetskaya has been found guilty of using drugs and banned from athletics for two years . Ten announced former Canadian world record holder and Olympic gold medal winner Donovan Bailey would join their commentary team for the remainder of the Games. ""Steve's priority is his family and he has left Glasgow to be with his wife, Ekaterina, and son Maxim. He has delivered brilliant commentary for the Games, and Network Ten fully supports his decision,"" said the statement from Ten. Ekaterina Kostetskaya, who gave birth to the couples' first child last year, received the doping ban after a world championship race on August 30, 2011. When Hooker retired from pole vaulting in April he said: 'I can now spend time supporting Katya in achieving what she wants in her career.' The runner's offence was listed as on August 30, 2011 - coinciding with her fifth placing in the 800m final at the world championships in Daegu . Kostetskaya has been handed a two-year ban from the sport and won't be able to race again until January 20, 2015 . Records from the 28-year-old's athlete biological passport, which is an electronic record for professional athletes, show she has been found guilty of 'use/attempted use of a prohibited substance/method' The biological passport allows for doping violations to be detected by noting variances from an athlete’s established levels outside the allowed limits, rather than testing for and identifying illegal substances. Kostetskaya came fifth in the 800m race in Daegu, South Korea, in 2011, where she is alleged to have used drugs. She has been handed a two-year ban from the sport and won't be able to race again until January 20, 2015. Kostetskaya and the now-retired Hooker, an Olympic and world pole vault champion, met at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and married in 2012. The 32-year-old is the third highest pole vaulter in history, behind Sergey Bubka and Renaud Lavillenie. He became the first Australian male track and field gold medallist in 40 years when he won gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics with a vault of 5.96 metres. He retired from athletics in April 2014, choosing to focus on his family. Kostetskaya gave birth to their first son, Maxim, in 2013. 'After some serious thought I've decided to move onto the next phase of my life and focus on new things that bring me as much joy as athletics has for the past 15 or so years,' reflected Hooker in an interview with the IAAF. 'Family is my biggest priority now. Being a husband and a father is amazing, and I love the change from being an individual athlete with just me to worry about,' he added. 'I can now spend time supporting Katya in achieving what she wants in her career. She has done so much already but she has results that suggest she is more than capable of doing more and I want to be able to assist as much as I can in making that happen.'","Steve Hooker was commentating at the Commonwealth Games for Ten .

"By . Simon Jones . Norwich are interested in signing goalkeeper Davide Bassi from Italian club Empoli as a possible replacement for John Ruddy, who they fear may leave the club this summer.

"By . Paul Collins . Leeds have announced the double signing of midfielder Tommaso Bianchi and striker Souleymane Doukara. The duo's arrival takes president Massimo Cellino's summer signing spree to four following the captures of goalkeeping pair Marco Silvestri and Stuart Taylor. Colourful former Cagliari owner Cellino has been making waves ever since his arrival at Elland Road in January and, after selling captain Ross McCormack to Fulham for a fee understood to be £11million, is now building a squad for new head coach Dave Hockaday to select from. Heading for Yorkshire: Tommaso Bianchi  has joined Leeds from Sassuolo on a four-year deal . Bianchi has signed a four-year deal with Leeds from Serie A side Sassuolo - achieving promotion with them in 2013. The 25-year-old is an age-grade Italian international and Hockaday believes he can occupy a number of roles. 'He can play on the left, right or in the number 10 position and he can score goals,' he said of Bianchi, who spent last season on loan with Modena. Cellino has also moved to try and fill McCormack's position with the season-long loan of Senegalese striker Doukara. Temporary: Souleymane Doukara (left) arrives at Elland Road on a season-long loan from Catania . He joins from Catania, spending last season on loan with Serie B side Juve Stabia. 'He is a big, powerful and fast player with a hunger to succeed. He is exactly what we need at the club.' Cellino is close to making a fifth signing in the shape of Switzerland international defender Jonathan Rossini, but it is understood he has no interest in Rochdale's Scott Hogan or Rotherham's Kieran Agard, contrary to reports. While Cellino makes changes to his first-team, he has also been making alterations to the club's academy with coaches Leigh Bromby and Richard Naylor - both part of Leeds' promotion-winning side in 2010 - leaving their posts. Former Sheffield Wednesday striker Benito Carbone is working in an unpaid role at the academy.","Bianchi arrives on a four-year deal from Italian side Sassualo .

"By . David Kent . Leeds owner Massimo Cellino has told his players it is 'mandatory' they live in the city. The 57-year-old took control in April after successfully winning his appeal against the Football League's decision to block his takeover and he quickly set about changing the club from top to bottom. Brian McDermott, who was sacked in January only to be reinstated, left the club by mutual consent and was replaced by little-known former Forest Green manager Dave Hockaday. United in Leeds: Club owner Massimo Cellino has stated his players must live in the city . Off you go: Brian McDermott left his position as manager soon after Cellino took over . Cellino also closed Leeds' training complex at Thorp Arch down for six weeks to cut costs and asked the players to bring their own lunches once the site was reopened. Now, in an attempt to ensure the squad is close-knit and prevent tardiness, the Italian plans to introduce a rule that will dictate where the players can live. 'Next season I do not want one single player who lives outside of Leeds, no way. That is mandatory,' Cellino told BBC Radio Leeds. 'Last year there were players who were coming late to games. Next year before a home game the players will stay together, have dinner together and go to the game together. 'I found out that most of the games that are close to Leeds we go to by bus, but we don't have our own. Why not? I would love to have a Leeds bus and I am going to buy one.' Bring it back: Cellino has secured a deal which will help Leeds buy back Elland Road . Protest: Leeds fans showed their unhappiness over Cellino's take over . In the same interview, Cellino claimed the Whites were debt-free and that he has done a deal with previous owners GFH Capital, who still have a 25 per cent share in the club, which will help release cash to buy Elland Road back. 'There is no debt any more and we have found a deal with GFH and I am glad for that,' he added. 'We are close to raising £30million of capital and that is without the money we got for (Ross) McCormack. We did not budget for his sale because we did not want him to go. 'The decision to buy back the stadium had been made before Ross was sold but now we can use that money for the deal.

"By . Martha Kelner . Follow @@marthakelner . It is a sad indictment of the ruinous procession of owners who have occupied the boardroom at Elland Road over the last decade that Leeds United fans are welcoming convicted fraudster Massimo Cellino as their new man in charge. There is a grim fatalism among the faithful, a sense that Britain’s most dysfunctional club will always make news for the wrong reasons, a trend that began 40 years ago with Brian Clough’s disastrous 44 days in charge immortalised in the book The Damned United. One more owner marking his arrival at Elland Road with a series of eyebrow-raising quotes and seemingly illogical decisions is grist to the mill. Just like Clough telling Billy Bremner and Co to dump all their medals in the dustbin, Cellino’s wind of change is nothing more than a mild breeze to the Leeds fans. VIDEO Scroll down to watch the most obscure Leeds United fan chant you're likely to see . Destined for failure? Cellino has hired an unproven manager and promised a return to the Premier League . The original Damned United: Legendary manager Brian Clough's 44-day stint at Leeds was a huge failure . The Italian has made a number of madcap . moves since taking over in April after overturning a Football League . ruling which deemed he was not a ‘fit and proper person’ to own a . football club. He shut the players’ canteen, told them to bring their . own sandwiches, demanded they live in the city, and has now informed . them they must buy their own match-day socks. Cellino hired Dave Hockaday as coach, a man who was sacked by non-League Forest Green Rovers after losing seven of eight games. But . he has promised to buy back their stadium ‘by November’ and get Leeds . back into the Premier League within two years. He offers hope to fans . who have been let down by owners and managers since chairman Peter . Ridsdale, whose legacy of reckless spending is still felt at the club. Dubious: Cellino appointed Dave Hockaday as coach despite his poor track record in management . Better days: Club legend Billy Bremner in action against Newcastle United . Division One champions: Gordon Strachan and his Leeds team-mates celebrate . Lifelong Leeds fan Dave Simpson, who . wrote The Last Champions, a book about Howard Wilkinson’s 1992 title . winners, claimed even the decision to recruit Hockaday is defensible. ‘We’ve had big-name managers — Terry Venables, Peter Reid, Neil Warnock — . none of them have ever done anything at Leeds, so it might be worth . having a go on a complete unknown quantity,’ he said. There has . been a marked turnaround in opinion about Cellino. When he first tried . to take over in February, angry fans barricaded his car inside the West . Stand car park. Then a prankster released online a phone conversation . where he ranted about Leeds striker Noel Hunt’s wages and the ‘f****** . devil’ David Haigh (Leeds then managing director). ‘He tells it how it is in no uncertain terms and the fans relate to that because that’s a very Yorkshire trait,’ said Simpson. Cellino, . 56, said this week that at the time of his buy-out, Leeds cost £125,000 . a day to run, of which £70,000 was essentially losses. Fraudster? Cellino openly admitted the reason he sold McCormack is because he was Leeds best player . ‘This club is going to have more . quiet time and less problems now,’ he said, ‘and the people who used to . rip the club off, they’re going to stop. I’ll protect the club from . everyone, including myself.’ He claimed substantial cuts and a . reduced wage bill were starting to reduce expenditure. But the immediate . future of Leeds may be more turbulent than he expects, with at least a . couple of sacked employees seeking legal advice about securing fair . payouts from the club. The effects of the new regime are already . being felt among the staff. Three of their most loyal academy coaches . were axed two weeks ago. Leigh Bromby, who played for Leeds from 2009 to . 2013, returned from a family holiday to a letter from academy director . Neil Redfearn, telling him his services were no longer required. Ditto . Phil Wilson, head of coaching at the academy. Richard Naylor, a former . club captain, had a meeting where the only representative of the club . was a payroll officer. Goalkeeping coach Andy Leaning was also axed. Fans' favourite: Richard Naylor battle with Wayne Rooney during his time as Leeds captain . Goodbye: Naylor has a white rose tattooed on his upper arm, such is his affinity with the club . Naylor, such a diehard Leeds fan he had a . white rose tattoo inked on his upper arm when he moved to Ipswich, was . the most surprising departure. He coached the Under-18s to a league . title last season and secured professional contracts for 14 out of 18 of . his players — the best ever success rate at the club. Bromby even . offered to continue working with the Under-16s for free. ‘I love the . club and I wanted to grow as a coach there,’ he said. ‘I’ve had a season . ticket since I was a boy and so have my dad and granddad so I wanted to . give something back. Richard and I are both local lads.’ Bromby . said he ‘holds no grudges against Leeds’, and he is often called by . first-team players for advice. ‘I hope Cellino can be a success. He . seems to be stripping things back to basics with the players.’ Gone, . too, is club captain and top scorer Ross McCormack, sold to Fulham for . £11million. ‘I didn’t want to sell McCormack because for me, he was the . best player we had,’ said Cellino. ‘He scored 29 goals.’ Allowed to leave: Last season's top scorer Ross McCormack has been sold to Fulham for £11million . Replacement: Cellino has brought in Italian Tommaso Bianchi from Modena to fill void left by McCormack . New face: Goalkeeper Marco Silvestri has also moved to Elland Road from Italy . Cellino has looked to his native Italy . for new blood, signing goalkeeper Marco Silvestri, midfielder Tommaso . Bianchi and forward Souleymane Doukara. He also promised ‘five or six’ further signings. Across Yorkshire, in a smart house in Harrogate, . Bill Fotherby, former Leeds managing director, is not hopeful of the new . regime. ‘Where’s the ambition there,’ he said, ‘to get rid of your best . player?’ At 82, Fotherby, closely associated with the Howard . Wilkinson era that brought the last title to Leeds, looks like the sort . of chap who would slap you on the back and stuff a cigar in your mouth. He claims the club has been on a downhill spiral since Ridsdale took . over. ‘Cellino is no different from the others,’ he said, ‘hiring a . non-League manager to go into what should be a Premier League club, . where’s the ambition there? Leeds has been raped of money and ambition . for years now. When I was there we had 40,000 crowds every week and . plans to expand to 60,000 seats. Now they’re happy if they get 20,000. ‘Leeds . should be top six in the Premier League. A city this size with . supporters as passionate as they are and they’ve been robbed by . irresponsible owners who borrowed money on future gates. How dare they . do that! It’s the fans who I feel sorry for.’","Italian has told players to bring their own sandwiches to training, buy their own matchday socks and demanded they live in Leeds .

"By . Laurie Whitwell . Follow @@lauriewhitwell . Ivan Rakitic wants FIFA’s ban on Luis Suarez to be overturned so the Uruguayan can begin training at Barcelona as soon as possible. And the Croatian international, signed this summer from Sevilla, believes once the former Liverpool striker takes the field alongside Neymar and Lionel Messi, the best three players in the world will be united in the same team – surpassing Real Madrid rival Cristiano Ronaldo. Suarez is due to make his return from a four-month suspension for biting Italy’s Giorgio Chiellini against Real at the Bernabeu on October 26. His ban from ‘any football-related activities’ ends the day before. Plenty to say: Ivan Rakitic (left) trains with his Barcelona team-mates at St George's Park . Talking tactics: Rakitic was speaking at a press conference while Barcelona are staying in England . But he and Barcelona have taken an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport and even though no hearing dates have been set a statement released by CAS last week said: ‘It is likely that a final award will be rendered well before the end of August.’ Rakitic, speaking during Barcelona’s stay at St George’s Park in Burton, expects the ban on Suarez - who has moved to the Pyrenees to train - to be quashed. ‘I think he is one of the best players in the world, so of course I would like if he could stay tomorrow or today with us,’ said Rakitic. ‘I am expecting he can start soon with us, and I hope he will bring to us the same as he did Liverpool.’ Messi and Neymar are also absent from the training camp at the FA’s National Football Centre because of World Cup exertions. Rakitic believes when the Argentine and Brazilian are back Barca will have the top three players on the planet. New admirers: Luis Suarez has moved to the Pyrenees to improve his fitness while he is suspended . Day in the sun: Suarez is available to play from the end of October following his lengthy ban . He said: ‘I think that these three players are maybe the best players in the world, the others (at Barcelona) I think have to be with them. From the three players we can learn so much. We have to do our best. ‘But I think the team is not only these three players. Every player has to work in his position, so if these three players are better, we will also be better. We have to work together to be a strong team, a hard team. We hope they will be with us next week and start work together.’ Rakitic understands trophies must now follow for Luis Enrique’s team. ‘It doesn’t matter if you change a lot of players or not, this club deserves to win games and titles and that is what we are here for and what we are working for.’ Dream team: Suarez will join Neymar (left) and Lionel Messi (right) in a potent Barcelona attack next season .","Luis Suarez is training in the Pyrenees during his ban .

"By . Andy Newport, Press Association . Joe Royle has joined the Sky Bet Championship side Norwich as a football consultant. The former Everton, Manchester City and Oldham boss joins a new look set-up at Carrow Road following relegation from the Premier League. Last month, Neil Adams was confirmed as the club's full-time manager and the club have also appointed Falkirk boss Gary Holt and former Under-21 boss Mark Robson as first team coaches. Experienced head: Joe Royle appointed football consultant at Norwich . Adams said: 'Mark and Gary are two people I've worked with closely and both will bring enthusiasm, hunger and experience to the coaching team. They have also played at the highest levels in this country. 'Joe is someone who I have played for at both Championship and Premier League level, and he has amassed a vast amount of knowledge during his time in the game. He has been there, seen it and done it so to speak, and has also been very successful during his time as both a player and a manager.' Royle will support and advise Adams' football management team having initially worked with the new boss when he was manager of Oldham Athletic during Adams' playing days. Norwich plan to announce a new technical director shortly and are currently interviewing a number of candidates for the position of director of recruitment. Moving on: Gary Holt is returning to his old club Norwich with his family . Early on Monday afternoon Falkirk released a statement on their website explaining to supporters that Holt was moving to Carrow Road. But just two hours later they were forced to remove that statement as they admitted no deal had been agreed and that Holt was still in charge at the Falkirk Stadium. When Norwich then announced on their website at around 5pm that an agreement had been reached, the original Falkirk statement was then reposted and the apology taken down. Former Scotland international Holt - an ex-Canaries player - will now link up again with boss Adams, who he worked alongside in the Norwich academy set-up before moving back to Scotland last year when he was handed the Falkirk job. After clearing up their earlier mistake, Falkirk wished Holt luck on his new venture. New team: Gary Holt will work with Norwich boss Neil Adams . Their statement read: 'The club can confirm that Head Coach Gary Holt has accepted a coaching role at Norwich City after Falkirk granted the Carrow Road side permission to speak to him over the weekend.' Bairns chairman Martin Ritchie added: 'The Club fully understands Gary's wishes to return with his family to Norwich. We would like to wish him every success in the future and to thank him for all his work at Falkirk over the last year.' Holt led Falkirk to third in the Scottish Championship this season but lost out on promotion when they were beaten by Hamilton in the play-off semi-finals. But his employers had even started the search for his replacement, adding in a further statement: 'Following today's announcement that Gary Holt is leaving the club to take up the post of assistant manager at Norwich City, the search starts immediately for a new head coach. 'The club aims to have a new head coach in position by the time the team come back for pre-season training on Thursday, June 26. To meet this very tight timescale, the club will draw up a shortlist of potential candidates by the end of this week.'","Norwich make three appointments to managerial and coaching team .

"Michael Phelps will take another small step in his comeback to competitive swimming when he competes in two races; but this time he will do it without the presence of his friend and greatest rival. The 28-year-old competed for the first time since retiring after the London Olympics when he plunged back into the pool at a Grand Prix meet in Phoenix last month. He was narrowly beaten in the 100 metres butterfly by Ryan Lochte, his uber-competitive team mate whom Phelps credits for driving him to greater heights. Shock: Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps came out of retirement to compete in a Grand Prix in Phoenix . That loss only helped the competitive juices to start flowing again in an ominous warning to his rivals that he has his heart set on greater goals. On Friday, Phelps will again compete in the 100m fly at a Grand Prix meet in Charlotte, North Carolina, but without Lochte, who is taking a break to overcome a minor injury. Phelps will also compete in 200m freestyle, an event he won at the 2008 Beijing Olympics when he captured a mind-boggling eight gold medals, but dropped from his programme for London. Phelps has not said what his long-term plans are this time, insisting he is simply testing the waters to see if he still enjoys the grind of training, but he has not ruled out the possibility of competing at the 2016 Olympics in Rio. Going for gold: Phelps is the most decorated Olympian of all time with 22 medals . As the most decorated Olympian of all time with nothing to prove, Phelps is unlikely to take on another massive programme but could still add to his golden stockpile with a reduced schedule. Although he was beaten in the 100m butterfly in Phoenix, he did enough to qualify for a place at this year’s US National championships in California, which double as the selection event for next year’s world titles in Russia. The 100m butterfly is one of two individual events that Phelps won at three successive Olympics. And if he qualifies for the event at Rio, he will automatically make the US men’s medley relay team, which has never been beaten at the Olympics. Phelps is unlikely to swim the more gruelling 200m freestyle at Rio but would be an automatic pick for the 4x200m relay team, as long as he qualifies. He faces stiff competition winning the 200m freestyle at Charlotte against a field that includes reigning Olympic champion, Yannick Agnel of France, who now trains with Phelps in North Baltimore. But results matter very little in the early stages of his comeback and a qualifying time for the nationals could be all that Phelps wants for now. Despite his staggering achievements, Phelps and long-time coach Bob Bowman have always been coy about revealing their plans and nothing has changed. They have still not said when he will race again after Charlotte, saying only that their next plan was to head to Colorado for intense high-altitude training.

"By . Lyndon Lloyd . After Everton sealed a permanent deal for a club record £28million, lifelong fan Lyndon Lloyd of Toffeeweb looks back on a successful summer... and looks forward to a bright future. In this era of soaring transfer fees, the £28million deal that Everton negotiated with Chelsea for Romelu Lukaku almost appears modest. At close to double the fee paid for Marouane Fellaini in 2008,  it represents a quantum leap from the last four transfer windows, during which Everton did not spend a penny on a first-team acquisition. In shattering the club’s record transfer fee for an incoming player, Everton have delivered a statement of intent to the Premier League. True Blue: Romelu Lukaku joined Everton on a permanent deal after a successful loan at Goodison . VIDEO Lukaku return marks significant day in Everton history . It presents further signs that one of English football’s sleeping giants may finally be awakening from its slumbers. And this in the same week as its brightest hope, Ross Barkley, followed Martinez, Seamus Coleman and Leighton Baines in putting pen to paper on a long-term contract extension. But how much is left in the Goodison Park coffers to bring in further reinforcements remains to be seen. The Toffees’ capture of Lukaku and Gareth Barry, another of last season’s impressive temporary signings, illustrates the power of the much-maligned loan market and the effective way in which Martinez has used it. The leader of the pack: Signing Gareth Barry (centre) was a blinding bit of business by Roberto Martinez . Together with the £4m paid for midfielder Muhamed Besic, Everton have committed £34m this summer just to bring senior squad numbers back to where they were when the 2013-14 campaign finished in May. But they are yet to replace the mercurial talents of another loanee, Gerard Deulofeu. By his own admission, Martinez needs at least 27 players at his disposal in order to cope with the extra demands that will be placed on his squad by Everton’s involvement in Europe. He hit his target of signing a genuine No 9 in the form of Lukaku, and nailed down his options in the vital defensive midfield anchor role that is central to his team’s attacking style. New addition: Bosnain international Muhamed Besic (right) will add all-action performances to Everton . The Spaniard has the core of his first-choice side settled before the season has kicked off, instead of having to wait until the last minute in the transfer window to acquire key components. Importantly, he now has the leeway to round out his squad with a mix of affordable permanent signings and targeted loan acquisitions that will add more talent in forward areas - without putting excessive strain on the bank balance. It is a necessarily prudent transfer strategy, one that hasn’t always been popular among supporters but which has helped Everton avoid the boom-and-bust approach that has been so damaging to the likes of Blackburn Rovers, Portsmouth and QPR in recent years. If, in combination with Martinez’s enterprising management, it results in a long-awaited top-four finish and vaulting the club back to its former place among England’s elite, it would be rich reward for years of patience and frustration at looking through what once seemed like an impenetrable glass ceiling. Making his point: Martinez enjoyed a glorious first season at Goodison, just missing out on a top-four finish .","The Lukaku deal sends out a statement to the Premier League .

"By . Charles Martland . Louis van Gaal has refused to be drawn into any mind games with Jose Mourinho as his Manchester United side prepare to do battle with Chelsea this season. The Dutchman knows Mourinho well from mentoring him at Barcelona, but insists he won't react to any wind-ups from the Portuguese. Asked if he was looking forward to facing old pal Mourinho, Van Gaal said: 'No. I play against Chelsea. And not against Jose Mourinho. My team and his team are playing against each other.' VIDEO Scroll down to watch The best of Jose's put downs and wind ups . New rivals: Man United boss Louis van Gaal will come head-to-head with Jose Mourinho . But be warned, Louis, Mourinho drags everyone in eventually. Since his arrival on English shores in 2004, the Portuguese has dragged players, referees and opposition managers into his web of mind-games. And he didn't let his guard slip after returning to Chelsea last summer, either. Already the Blues boss has aimed a first swipe at his old mentor, suggesting United overpaid for teen sensation Luke Shaw. Van Gaal remained ice cool: 'No. I’m not reacting to that kind of stuff.' He'd be the first. Here, Sportsmail looks at Mourinho's war of words with top bosses throughout his time in England. Arsene Wenger . Mourinho’s trading of verbal blows with the Arsenal boss dates back to August 2005, when Wenger claimed that Chelsea’s defensive tactics were putting 'the sport in danger'. The Portuguese responded by calling Wenger a 'voyeur' and, since then, a never-ending battle has taken place between the pair. Last season proved no exception, with the Frenchman being labelled a 'specialist in failure' by the Special One before Wenger had another blast at the Chelsea manager over the transfer of Juan Mata to Manchester United. A feud set to rumble on. Mourinho on Wenger: 'He is what you call in England a voyeur. He is someone who likes to watch other people. There are some guys who, when they are at home, have this big telescope to look into the homes of other people and see what is happening. Wenger must be one of them… it’s a sickness.' Wenger on Mourinho: 'He’s out of order, disconnected with reality and disrespectful. When you give success to stupid people, it makes them more stupid sometimes.' Feud Rating: 9/10 - Boiling over. False handshake: Mourinho and Arsene Wenger greet each other ahead of Arsenal's clash at Chelsea . Rafa Benitez . The relationship between Jose and Benitez has fluctuated over the years, with the two ‘good friends’ at one point and blasting each other at others. Once Chelsea won the Premier League title in 2005 and again a year later, the war of words began, with Benitez questioning whether the Blues really were one of the best sides in world football. Mourinho responded by mocking the Spaniard’s relative lack of success, asking the press 'how many championships has Benitez won,' before answering with 'none'. The row remains ongoing, with Benitez recently claiming to want no association with the Chelsea manager, because of his 'crossing [of] the line of sportsmanship.' Mourinho on Benitez (upon leaving Inter in 2010 with the Spaniard replacing him): 'One thing is for certain, Benitez won’t do better than me.' Benitez on Mourinho: 'I like to talk about facts. At Liverpool, we eliminated his Chelsea from the Champions League with a team that cost half as much as his side. With the most expensive squad at Real Madrid, he did nothing in the Champions League.' Feud rating: 7/10 - Bubbling away. No eye contact: Then Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez fails to look at Chelsea boss Mourinho . Sir Alex Ferguson . Mourinho’s relationship with the retired Manchester United manager has perhaps never been the one football fans would have expected. The pair have remained good friends, often sharing their footballing secrets with each other, as well as discussing players and tactics. The Portuguese tactician has said, very simply that the two men 'trust each other' and that he knew of Sir Alex’s retirement long before the news was broken. In return, Mourinho informed Ferguson of his return to Chelsea. The pair have traded harsher blows at times, with the Scot complaining about Mourinho’s 'personal crusade' against him. Jose also had to patch up their relationship after berating Ferguson for pressurising the referee at half-time during a Carling Cup semi-final. Mourinho is said to have cried when not approached to succeed Ferguson, having been convinced, says journalist Diego Torres, by a 'friendship of genuine trust'. Mourinho on Ferguson: 'He was unique, absolutely unique. The number of trophies he won for Manchester United in English football is absolutely amazing.' Ferguson on Mourinho: 'Jose understands winning and losing are twins in a way. When you win you don’t gloat and when you lose you don’t go bananas.' Feud rating: 3/10 - Friendly with the occasionally harsh mind-games. Good friends: Former United boss Sir Alex Ferguson has made it clear he is a keen admirer of Mourinho . Manuel Pellegrini . There is little love lost between Mourinho and the current Manchester City manager. The rivalry dates back to the pair’s time in Spain, with Mourinho, succeeding the Chilean as manager of Real Madrid, claiming Pellegrini’s second place finish the previous season made Real 'the first loser'. Bitterness has lingered ever since and has now been transferred to the Premier League. Mourinho leaping into the Stamford Bridge crowd after a late winner against City last year, followed by a refusal to shake hands, did not help matters, but Pellegrini ultimately had the final word by capturing the Premier League crown. Mourinho on Pellegrini: 'Second place is just the first loser. If Madrid were to fire me, I wouldn’t go to Malaga. I’d go to a top-level team in Serie A or the Premier League.' Pellegrini on Mourinho: 'I didn’t expect anything else [from him]. I don’t like coaches who are only interested in results. The concepts of spectacle and creativity are fundamental to me.' Feud rating: 6/10 - A rivalry which keeps threatening to ignite. Mourinho keeps fuelling the fire, Pellegrini tries to keep out of it. Big rivals: Mourinho's Chelsea will compete with Manchester City for the title next season . Roberto Mancini . Mourinho created hostility between himself and the Italian upon his succession at Inter Milan. The Portuguese later claimed Mancini left him with little more than a 'five-a-side team' and the now Galatasaray manager responded by saying the comments were born out of jealousy. Mourinho is said to have turned down the invitation of Mancini to join him for dinner after Chelsea’s champions League tie with Galatasaray last season, keeping tensions high between the two men. Mourinho on Mancini: 'I won’t have a meal with somebody [Mancini] who has the same job as I do and the only thing we have in common is the fact we’re both football managers. I have no interest.' Mancini on Mourinho: 'When I went to Inter they played very bad football and we changed this. He took a team that I had built.' Feud rating: 7/10 - Not the greatest of friends. True enemies: Mourinho and Roberto Mancini have both made it clear they do not see eye-to-eye . Andre Villas-Boas . The young Portuguese manager worked closely under Mourinho at Chelsea and Inter Milan, before a spectacular fall-out between the two after Villas-Boas left to become a coach himself, having apparently not informed Mourinho of his unhappiness in a lesser role. The former has since claimed he does not even have Jose’s phone number and their relationship has remained frosty ever since. The rivalry eased somewhat after Villas-Boas was sacked by Tottenham late last year, with Mourinho calling his former protégé to console him and remind him that “another job will come.” Mourinho on Villas-Boas: 'I don’t care what he says. I’m not here to do that. I’m not interested.' Villas-Boas on Mourinho: 'We had a great personal and professional relationship before. We don’t have that now.' Feud rating: 5/10 - A bad fall out but the ice is thawing slowly. Compatriots: Andre Villas-Boas learned his trade under Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho . Alan Pardew . The Newcastle manager is another with whom Mourinho enjoys a largely friendly relationship. Jose voiced his support for Pardew after the latter was banned for headbutting Hull’s David Meyler in March this year, saying he 'spoke with Alan' just a couple of hours after the incident took place. Pardew, in return, praised Mourinho’s tactics and influence. Whilst Jose was with Real Madrid, Pardew was full of praise for him, calling him a 'big manager' and suggesting that his 'impact cannot be lost on my education'. Mourinho on Pardew: 'He is a good friend and a great guy.' Pardew on Mourinho: 'There were things I was seeing [from Mourinho] that I hadn’t seen in English football before. Some of the managerial traits he was bringing I’ve learned from. And I can’t help but say I’ve nicked a few of them!' Feud rating: 1/10 - A genuine friendship. Friends reunited: Mourinho and Newcastle boss Alan Pardew have a strong relationship . Sam Allardyce . Jose and Big Sam have relatively little history between them, which is understandable considering Mourinho’s view that he would never want to fight the West Ham manager, who would in his words 'kill me'. The last Premier League campaign did see a war of words however, with the pair trading blows at their respective press conferences after a goalless draw at Stamford Bridge. Mourinho on Allardyce’s tactics: 'It’s very difficult to play a football match where only one team wants to play. This is football from the nineteenth Century.' Allardyce on Mourinho: 'I don’t give a s***e to be honest…we’ve out-tacticed him, outwitted him.' Feud rating: 4/10 - A spat which could continue into next season.

"By . Tom Gardner . A retired welder has described how he came within hours of an agonising death after contracting all three deadly forms of bubonic plague from a cat bite. Paul Gaylord, 61, relived in vivid detail how the horrifying symptoms of the Black Death began to take over his body - gradually turning his hands black. Mr Gaylord, who lives in a remote part of Oregon, 12 miles from the small town of Prineville, spent nearly a month attached to a life support machine as his body battled to fight the deadly illness. Paul Gaylord, of Prineville, Oregon, spent nearly a month on a life support machine as he battled bubonic plague . The plague began to consume his vital organs - causing his long to collapse and his heart stop beating. Doctors had discussed switching off his life support machine the day before woke from his coma, he said as he revealed how close to death he had come. Now on the mend following the infection, he told the Guardian about the moments after he was rushed to hospital. He said: 'Hooked up to a dialysis machine, I had collapsed lungs and at one point my heart stopped... Technically, I shouldn't be here.' 'My doctor told me I had developed all . three stages of the plague: bubonic (the least lethal form, which . infects the lymphatic system), pneumonic (which infects the lungs) and . septicaemic (the bloodstream). Some people have survived bubonic plague, . but not all three, apparently.' Horrifying: Mr Gaylord's symptoms included his hands and feet swelling up and turning black as the infection killed his flesh . Gaylord was infected in June, 2013, . when he tried to remove a mouse from the throat of a choking cat. The . plague-stricken animal bit him. Within 48 hours he began to suffer flu-like symptoms. Soon his skin started to turn grey and the glands under his arms swell to the size of lemons. Recent research suggests that the bubonic plague is on the increase in affluent communities in the U.S.. It used to be associated with squalor, unsanitary conditions and rodent infestations. But as more people move to natural environments where carriers such as ground squirrels and woodrats live, infection increases . The disease is caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis that is spread through flea bites. About 11 cases of plague a year have occurred in the U.S. since 1976. 17 people have been infected by the disease in Oregon since 1934. Mr Gaylord is still coming to terms with how serious his illness was and how miraculous his recovery has been. Told . he faced a life of dialysis because his vital organs were too badly . damaged, Mr Gaylord underwent one treatment before his body regained its . functions. But it was too late to save his long-dead fingers, which surgeons have now amputated. 'I . still have my hands and part of my thumbs. They took off all the toes . on my left foot, and about a third of my right foot is gone', he added. 'It's . hard to believe it happened to me, but rather than feel depressed, I've . always felt positive and happy to be alive.' Mr Gaylord retired as a welder and now spends much of his free time indulging in his hobby making knives in his garage. Although the plague is generally connected to the Middle Ages, the woman is the 18th person sickened by the disease in Oregon since 1934. A seven-year-old girl, Sierra Jane Downing, also contracted the disease while on a camping trip in Colorado this month. Video Source Thedoctorstv.com . Recovery: Paul Gaylord, 61, who lost all his fingers and toes and the top halves of his thumbs after contracting bubonic plague from a cat bite, works on making a knife at his home workshop near Prineville, Oregon . It is believed she caught it from a dead squirrel, who she had asked her parents if she could bury. They said no, but she knelt beside it and doctors believe fleas could have jumped on to her sweater. Days after they returned from the trip, her parents found her in the bathroom having a seizure. She was rushed to hospital and treated with antibiotics once doctors realised what it was. She will make a full recovery and has been released from hospital. Without treatment the plague kills around two thirds of infected humans within four days. It causes an infection that kills cells, causing gangrene which also often results in amputation. Symptoms of the plague in humans, which typically appear within four days, include fever, chills and a bloody or watery cough. In animals, it presents itself with enlarged lymph nodes under the jaw, as well as fever and tiredness. Research suggests that the bubonic plague, which used to be associated with squalor, is on the increase in affluent communities in the U.S. As more people move to natural environments where ground squirrels and woodrats live, infection increases. The disease, associated with the medieval period and made famous by historic etchings, similar to the one below of a London town crier in1665 calling for plague victims to be brought forward, is caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis that is spread through flea bites. Symptoms usually appear between two and five days after exposure to the bacteria. They include gangrene of the extremities such as toes, fingers, lips and tip of the nose; fever; muscle cramps; seizures; lymph gland swelling. Other potential symptoms include heavy breathing, continuous vomiting of blood, aching limbs and extreme pain, usually caused by the decay of the skin while the person is still alive. Without treatment the plague kills around two thirds of infected humans within four daysAbout 11 cases of plague a year have occured in the U.S. since 1976.","Paul 'Steve' Gaylord's developed flu-like symptoms after a bite from his cat .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . No one likes warm beer, or having to wait around for it to be chilled. But a new gadget now claims to be able to transform your warm drink into a refreshing beverage within seconds. The Rapidcool device claims to cool drink cans and bottles from room temperature to 4°C in under 45 seconds. Scroll down for video . The Rapidcool device claims to cool drink cans and bottles from room temperature to 4°C in under 45 seconds . The product, designed by London-based Enviro-Cool, has received £760,000  in European Union research funding. The investment is based on the product’s potential to significantly reduce energy requirements in supermarket cooler aisles. The inventors hope the device will allow shoppers to choose a drink from a supermarket shelf, place it into the Rapidcool machine and get it back chilled without waiting around. The gadget uses patented V-Tex technology that rotates the drink at a certain speed. This, according to the company, mixes carbonated drinks but avoids fizzing when the drink is opened . The inventors hope it will allow shoppers to choose a drink from a supermarket shelf, place it into the Rapidcool and get it back chilled within seconds . Across Europe, combined commercial refrigerator and freezers are estimated to consume 85TWh of electricity per annum, equivalent to the energy required to power over 20 million households. Rapidcool claims to provide energy savings of over 80 per cent compared with some standard open front drinks chillers and a 54 per cent saving compared with glass door coolers. Previous efforts have been made to achieve rapid drinks cooling on demand. The problem has always been the time it takes to effectively cool the liquid. If the cooling is very fast then the outer layers of liquid freeze before the inner liquid is cooled creating ‘slushing.’ The gadget uses patented V-Tex technology by rotating the drink at a certain speed to create a something known as the ‘Rankine vortex’. This, according to the company, mixes carbonated drinks but avoids fizzing when the drink is opened. Although designed to work as a stand-alone unit, the cooling chamber can also be integrated into existing self-serve chillers. The group estimates that the average saving on electricity costs could be equal to £700 for each replaced fridge per year.","Gadget rapidly cool drink cans and bottles from room temperature to 4°C .

"By . Jo Whiley . A young researcher has re-opened the world's most southerly post office in Antarctica today, 50 years after it was abandoned. Anna Malaos, 30, is operating as polar postmistress from a hut on Detaille Island on the Antarctic Peninsula, which has no telephone, Internet access, electricity or running water. She is operating the post office, which will provide an international mail service, from a historic British base on a tiny outcrop of rock, surrounded by icebergs, glaciers and minke whales. Postmistress: Anna Malaos, 30, will work from the wooden hut on Detaille Island on the Antarctic Peninsula, which has no telephone, Internet access, electricity or running water . The world's most southerly post office has re opened in Antarctica today 50 years after it was abandoned . Anna, an expert in Antarctica and on secondment from her job as operations manager at the Antarctic Heritage Trust, is working in temperatures of minus 10C, which she says makes 'sticking stamps very tricky.' 'It's . an honour to be a Polar Postmistress' said Anna, from Cambridge. 'Detaille . Island was a British base built in the 1950s and, like every other . British base built during that time, it had its own Post Office. 'It's a privilege to be able to re-open it after all this time and reconnect the building with the world.' The isolated post office was closed in 1959 when solid sea ice prevented the base from being restocked for the season . The huts at Detaille Island were built in 1956 to provide a base from which to survey the Antarctic Peninsula. The science undertaken at this station contributed geological and meteorological findings to the work of the International Geophysical Year of Cooperation in 1957. But it was closed in 1959 when solid sea ice prevented the base from being restocked for the season. The men abandoned the base, taking with them only personal possessions and everything else was left behind. Today, the base provides an important reminder of the science and living conditions that existed when the Antarctic Treaty was signed 50 years ago. 'We are re-opening the Post Office to breathe new life into the building at Detaille Island,' said Rachel Morgan, director of the UK Antarctic Heritage Trust, a British charity which acts as custodian of several important historic buildings in the Antarctic. 'The base at Detaille Island, which was once a functioning science research station with its own Post Office, has a fascinating and important story to tell.' Penguin post: Detaille is a small island just south of the Antarctic Circle and 11 miles east of Liard Island. It is home to a colony of 1,000 pairs of Adelie penguins . Around 25 ships are expected to call at the post office over the next four weeks and more than 300 letters will be hand-franked and dispatched to the rest of the world. The letters will each receive a highly-prized Antarctic stamp and post mark and then travel by sea to the Falkland Islands where they will enter into the international mail system. All the money raised from stamp sales will go towards saving the historic building and protecting it against the harsh Antarctic winter weather. Anna will be assisted by Michael Powell, 49, from Crickhowell in South Wales who has over 25 years of Antarctic experience and Tudor Morgan, 41, from Monmouthshire. The post office will have to close for the season at the end of the month, when the island sees 24-hour darkness.

The bus was packed with pupils from a school in Ilford, northeast London, when the driver heard noises coming from underneath the coach. The driver drove the coach to Ilford Police Station, where cops found a 16-year-old from Sudan 'attached to the   chassis'. It is believed he sneaked under the bus in Calais and managed to hold on for 107 miles - until he was caught in Ilford. Scroll down for video . Stowaway: An illegal immigrant clung to the bottom of a school bus for more than 100 miles after it made its way back to the UK from a day trip to France. Pictured, migrants try their luck on lorries out of Calais, in this file picture from May . The secondary schoolchildren had been on a day trip to Calais and were returning around 7pm, when the driver heard noises and suspected he was carrying   a stowaway.

A spokesman for Dan's Luxury Travels, the coach company which was used for the school trip, said: 'The driver did what he had to do. 'He did his legal checks for the vehicle. When he heard a noise underneath he took it straight to the police station and the man was arrested.' Local Adrian Travers, 45, said: 'The poor guy looked terrified - imagine hanging on to the bottom of a bus all the way from Calais.' On Saturday it was reported that school pupils on a trip to France were left in tears after their coach was targeted twice by illegal immigrants.

One suspect tried to board the bus when the pupils were going through passport control and another was spotted breaking in while the children were at a   shopping centre. Both of the suspects were arrested in front of the horrified children during the £300 four-day trip.","A Sudanese man claiming to be 16 was found underneath a bus full of pupils .

"By . Kate Gardiner, Press Association . England's Kristian Thomas has claimed silver in the men's vault final on the final day of Commonwealth gymnastics action at the SSE Hydro. Canada's Scott Morgan won gold with a total of 14.733, with a silver medal-winning score of 14.499 enough for Thomas while Singapore's Wah Toon Hoe took bronze with 14.195. Each gymnast completed two vaults with the average of both scores calculated to form their total, but the first did not go to plan for top qualifier Thomas as he was unable to stick his dismount although he landed the second to total 14.499. He did however move ahead of Hoe, who was the first gymnast to compete. Runner-up: England's Kristian Thomas poses with his silver medal after coming second in the vault final . Acrobatic: Thomas finished with a score of 14.499 after two vaults but he failed to land properly on the first . Morgan, who won rings gold on Thursday, leapt into the lead with two impressive vaults - 14.766 and 14.700 - which combined for a 14.733 average that edged ahead of Thomas. Scotland's Adam Cox, who is a primary school teacher and came out of gymnastics retirement to compete in Glasgow, was the next to vault but he did not hit the highs of his opponents and eventually finished the final in seventh place. India's Ashish Kumar put himself in contention on vault one but landed on his back for the second and scored no points as rules state zero is awarded if a gymnast fails to land feet first. Home favourite Frank Baines moved into fourth place with a 14.016 average leaving Thomas holding on to silver for England with two more men to compete.

"By . Claire Bates . Updated: . 10:25 EST, 7 February 2012 . As dog owners know, you are lucky if your pooch can be persuaded to collect your slippers without chewing them to pieces. But golden labrador Byron performs dozens of such tasks faultlessly for his owner every day. He helps 'best friend' Kate Cross peg out her washing, make her bed, go shopping and even take money out of the cash machine. Scroll down to meet Byron . I'll push that for you: Byron has learnt how to press the button at road crossings . The trained hound is a life-line for Kate, who suffers from Ehlers Danlos syndrome. The rare condition means the retired teacher's joints are so weak that she can dislocate her shoulder from just opening a door. But Byron is never far from her side - and has learned to do all the things Kate struggles to. The 49-year-old from Hinckley, Leicestershire, who received the star pet in 2007, said: 'I can’t imagine my life without Byron - he really is my best friend. 'He’s given me my life back - I can live independently and not have to rely on my husband or other people doing everything for me because Byron is always there. 'He never gets fed up with helping me - it’s all a big game to him, but I’d be lost without him.' Byron was trained by Sussex-based . charity Canine Partners - who have matched hundreds of assistance dogs . to people who really need their help. After . months of intensive training with the charity’s volunteer Puppy . Parents, the young dogs are carefully matched with new companions, . before training continues in their new homes. The dog pound: Byron stands on his hind legs to negotiate the cash machine . Nose for a bargain: Byron picks up the weekly groceries for Kate . Byron helps Kate from the moment she gets up in the morning - with no task too big or small for the seven-year-old. The faithful hound helps Kate into her wheelchair every morning, acting as a support for her as she steps out of bed into the chair. As she makes a morning coffee, Byron will open the fridge door himself, before fetching Kate a carton of milk. And the clever canine even retrieves his own breakfast bowl from the cupboard - before jumping up and placing his empty bowl in the washing up bowl. He accompanies Kate to the supermarket - reaching down to low shelves to pick up any item Kate has on her shopping list. And to the envy of dog owners everywhere, Byron can even open the door to let himself out to the toilet. How much is that, doggie? The Labrador hands over Katie's purse . Kate added: 'Byron knows more than 100 different commands, and can do just about anything I ask him too. 'In the supermarket, I stop my chair near to the item I want, and he follows my eyeline and takes the item off the shelf. 'It’s such a help to me, as small things like bending down and grasping things are really difficult for me. 'Byron even unloads my shopping onto the conveyor belt at the till and hands my purse over to the checkout assistants. 'He can do such amazing things - he takes my bank card and reaches up to put it into a cash machine, and takes the cash when it comes out, and passes it to me - all I have to do is put in my pin number. 'He can reach out and press pedestrian crossing buttons with his nose, and picks up anything I drop on the ground. Before we go to bed on cold nights, he even fetches my hot water bottle, and when I’ve filled it, he trots upstairs with it, and puts it on my side of the bed, under the covers. 'My condition means my circulation is very weak, so a nice warm bed is just what I need.' Breakfast time! Byron hints it's time for his meal . Delicate touch: Byron helps to load and unload the washing machine . Kate has suffered with Ehlers Danlos syndrome - an illness which makes her bones and skin progressively weaker - since she was a child. Her condition dashed her hopes of becoming a professional musician - and eventually, she was dislocating joints several times a day, and took to using a wheelchair. After being forced to take early retirement from her job as a primary school teacher, she grew so anxious about going outside that she was virtually housebound - after she was targeted by yobs after venturing outside in her wheelchair. Kate said: 'When I first got Byron, I hadn’t left the house by myself for almost 18 months. I felt useless, and I hated going outside - people stared and didn’t know how to speak to me. 'Once, I was in my wheelchair going through the park, when a gang of teenage boys playing football decided to use my chair for target practice. I was so upset, I couldn’t imagine going out again. I became afraid of the world. 'I had always loved dogs, and on a rare trip out to Crufts, my husband Stuart and I came across a stand for Canine Partners - a charity that provides assistance dogs to people who need help. Girl's best friend: Katie says she couldn't imagine life without Byron . No task too small: Byron helps make the bed and collects the milk for a cup of tea . 'They told me I was exactly the kind of person they could help - and within a few months, I had been paired up with Byron. 'We instantly clicked, and went through an intensive training camp together to teach him all the things he’d need to be able to do. I just couldn’t imagine my life without him now. 'If I have a fall, Byron is trained to fetch the phone, and a pillow and blanket, so I can get help. 'It’s given my husband peace of mind too, as he knows I’m never alone. 'It’s important to let him have time to just be a dog though too - and he loves nothing more than running around in the park getting covered in mud.' Faithful friend: Canine Partners matches helpful hounds with grateful owners . As well as helping hundreds of people affected by debilitating conditions, Canine Partners has also started to work with military charity Help for Heroes - to provide dogs for ex-soldiers who have been injured in service. A spokesperson for the charity said: 'We are thrilled with how successful the partnership between Kate and Byron is - their relationship exemplifies exactly what our work is all about. 'More than 1.2 million people in the UK use a wheelchair, and a significant number of those would benefit from a canine partner. We tailor train our dogs to each applicant’s individual needs, and try to help as many people as we can. 'These life transforming dogs also provide practical, psychological and social benefits including increased independence and confidence as well as increased motivation and self-esteem. A canine partner also brings companionship, a sense of security and increases social interaction.'

"By . Nick Harris . Andy Murray's fourth-round opponent Kevin Anderson has been practising with his former coach Ivan Lendl - but the Scot is confident Lendl will not have spilled any secrets. Reigning champion Murray, 27, plays South African Anderson on Monday for a place in the quarter-finals. Anderson has an American wife, Kelsey, and lives in Florida. He met Lendl by chance at the Crandon Park tennis club in Key Biscayne and the pair spent time on court together. Lendl was Murray's coach from the end of 2011 until March this year and helped him finally win a Grand Slam - guiding him to the US Open title in 2012, the Wimbledon title last year and Olympic gold. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's verdict of day six with Whitwell and Fraser . Upbeat: Andy Murray has breezed through his first three matches against low-ranked small fry . 'Ivan loves playing tennis, he hits balls all the time when he is over in Miami,' said Murray of Lendl and Anderson meeting up. 'That doesn't surprise me in the slightest.' Murray lost four Slam finals before finally winning his first. Lendl also lost four Slam finals before winning the first of eight he won in his career. He gave the Wimbledon champion valuable insight into how to become a winner. Murray insists that Lendl hitting with Anderson won't have helped  him. 'You can't compare practising with Ivan to playing against me, it's completely different,' he said. The journey towards a second straight Wimbledon title takes Murray into the land of giants this week - literally and figuratively. He has breezed through his first three matches against low-ranked small fry with straight-sets wins taking a total of five hours. On Monday he will see the gradient of the challenge rise steeply, facing 6ft 8in Anderson, the world No 18. And if he clears that hurdle, Bulgaria's dangerous world No 13 Grigor Dimitrov will probably await in the quarter-final, followed by world No 2 Novak Djokovic and world No 1 Rafa Nadal after that. Happy days: Murray has been able to take time out with actor Ricky Gervais . The contrast with last year is huge. As he sought to break the 77-year Fred Perry hoodoo, Murray did not face a single player from inside the top 20 before the final. And he knows that an easy first week this year carries a risk of complacency, although he insists he is ready for a stiffer challenge. 'It could become a problem if you are not mentally prepared for the matches to get more challenging,' he said yesterday. 'If you just think everything will be the same as it was in the first week and you are playing well enough, then you are complacent. I'm aware against Kevin things will be a lot tougher. There are going to be harder moments in the second week. 'Last year I was coming to the tournament having not played at the French Open and missed quite a bit of tennis. Because of the grass it was important for me to get a good start in the tournament because maybe physically I wasn't in my best shape. This year I don't see that being a problem.' Murray has faced Anderson twice. He won their first meeting back in 2010 at the Australian Open then lost at the Montreal Masters the following year. He wasn't a Grand Slam winner at that stage, of course. Murray has experience of playing  tall players; he has met Croatia's 6ft 11in Ivo Karlovic five times, including on grass, and won all five and played the USA's 6ft 10in John Isner twice and won both. 'Anderson doesn't serve as big as them but he is probably better from the back of the court,' said Murray. 'He has a better return game than Isner and Karlovic. There might be more chances to break but equally he will return better and make more balls when you are serving. Up for it: Murray will see the gradient of the challenge rise steeply, facing 6ft 8in Kevin Anderson . 'I'd say Anderson is more mobile than Karlovic. Most of the big guys now who play from the back of the court are pretty good movers.' Murray is one of the finest returners in the game but he will do some preparatory work with one of his coaching team, Danny Vallverdu, on facing Anderson's serve. 'He's obviously serving different angles at different heights, so the ball's bouncing up much higher. I'll have Danny serve at me  from just behind the service line. That's really the only thing I do differently.' The ease of Murray's progress means he spent less time on court than his key rivals as he overcame David Goffin, Blaz Rola and then, on Friday evening, Roberto Bautista Agut. With new coach Amelie Mauresmo  helping him maintain his on-court composure, Murray has looked quietly confident, certainly calm. 'I'm in familiar surroundings. That's going to make you feel more comfortable. Just being at home, staying in your own bed, having all of your friends and family around you - you're going to feel more relaxed away from the court. 'The nerves and the pressure here are also different to other tournaments for me, as well. It's probably greater here than it is at the other Grand Slams. But I enjoy pressure. I like feeling nervous. I'm not scared of that feeling. 'I felt like I've played my best tennis when I've been under pressure. I obviously love playing here.'","Murray's next challenge is the 6ft 8in Kevin Anderson .

"By . Catherine Ostler . As a writer and former magazine editor, I can deal with deadlines. Most of us can. But when it comes to anything that doesn’t have one, it’s another matter — I often start to procrastinate. Consider this sorry chain of events, which happened when I sat down to write a recent assignment, which had no firm deadline. First, I went to buy a cappuccino — I needed caffeine, I reasoned, to shake up my brain cells — followed by some wrapping paper for a child’s birthday present that I remembered had to be delivered that day. Scroll down for video . It's easy to procrastinate when you can convince yourself that everything is important but panic soon sets in . Then, when I got back, I rang the doctor (before the surgery shut for lunch) and listened to a recording of ‘your call is being held in a queue’ before giving up and browsing the local estate agent’s website for an hour (we’re not moving, I was just nosy) and picking at last night’s supper from the fridge — which was surprisingly good cold. Then I read the newspaper (research), washed my hair (so it could dry while I worked) and texted a man about a long-standing problem with the roof. A free magazine on the hall table beckoned — more research. By then, I’d lost two hours. In short, or rather at length, with a growing knot of anxiety in my chest, I procrastinated. Everything else seemed infinitely more pressing, or at least more doable, at that minute. And although I told myself I was clearing my slate of all other tasks that might distract me from work once I was sat down at my desk, the diminishing hours I had left became rather panic-stricken. I’m far from alone with this bad habit: about a quarter of people say procrastinating is a defining part of their personality. In fact, it’s a trait that’s been with us for a long, long time — a magazine reported this week that Egyptian hieroglyphs dating back to 1400BC have been found that read: ‘Friend, stop putting off work and allow us to go home in good time.’ Social media and internet browsing seem productive but valuable hours can be lost online (posed by model) But thanks to the rise in social media and the ease with which we can spend hours on the internet (there are even sites where you can take tests to find out how much of a procrastinator you are), it’s never been so easy to put things off. Procrastination has always been my pet demon, sitting on my shoulder suggesting non-urgent activities to delay the one at hand. When I was at school, I filled up my homework book with lists of projects until there were so many outstanding tasks that I threw it away in the end, overwhelmed, work unfinished. At university, I spent far more time drawing up a multi-coloured revision timetable than doing any studying. Procrastinating students suffer more colds, flu and gastro-intestinal problems . I’m so used to this demon, I’m even slightly fond of it, kidding myself I work best under pressure. But this love/hate relationship recently developed from one of indulgent self-tolerance to deep annoyance. Late one sleepless night, going to extremes, I had this thought: ‘What if I keep deferring everything I need to do until I’m dead, so I don’t do any of it?’ After sharing this thought with a novelist friend, she put me in touch with personal coach and business mentor Fiona Harrold. ‘People who procrastinate are most likely to be high achievers who set high standards for themselves, but perversely never feel that they’re good enough,’ she says. ‘They are often creative types and self-expression is part of the job, so they feel their work exposes a part of them. The task builds up and they became fraught with anxiety and concern about being judged. ‘We become so scared of the task at hand, that putting it off becomes an easier option. The problem is that we can’t put them off for ever, so we end up doing things in a rush, then feel far worse. It’s a perfect example of being unable to exhibit enough self-control to resist something that feels good at the time, even though we know it is bad for us.’ Business mentor Fiona Harrold says ‘People who procrastinate are most likely to be high achievers who set high standards for themselves, but perversely never feel that they’re good enough' (posed by model) She tells me that a classic example of this is ‘second novel syndrome’, where the fear of it not being good enough is so overwhelming it takes years, or can’t be written at all. ‘Elizabeth Gilbert, who wrote Eat, Pray, Love, said she was actually relieved when her second book failed, because it liberated her to write a third without the pressure of expectation,’ says Fiona. Procrastination is fed not just by perfectionism, but a hazy grip on the notion of time. ‘People get attached to the idea that you have to have a certain time-frame to complete something really well — say, an hour. If they can’t see a clear hour to do something, they’ll keep putting it off,’ says Fiona. ‘Drop that idea and you’ll get results quicker — sometimes it’s more important to get things done at all, than to do them perfectly.’ It makes sense in theory, but how do I stop myself from procrastinating in practice? ‘Give yourself a shorter deadline, because work will always stretch to fit time allocated,’ says Fiona. In other words, if you don’t have one, or it’s too far away, make a deadline up — any task with uncertain timing, no matter how mundane, can grind the mind to halt with its uncertainty. Catherine found that the coffee run was a good way to procrastinate (posed by model) ‘Do first the thing you’re most likely to put off, even if you only do it for 15 minutes,’ she adds. ‘Not knowing how long something will take can make it feel unbearable. ‘Especially since we all now have a shortened attention span, thanks to the internet, smartphones and screens in every room.’ No one ever feels like going for a run, she says, but if you commit to just 15 minutes, it seems less scary and more do-able. You might end up running for half an hour and find yourself enjoying it. But you can’t do it alone. ‘Numerous studies on New Year’s resolutions show the people who give up quickly tend to be those who don’t tell their peers what they are doing. ‘Those who succeed have a strong support network. If you are out of your comfort zone and aren’t sure you can get things done, you need cheerleaders — plus, you lose face if you don’t do it.’ Equally, Fiona says you shouldn’t label yourself a procrastinator, because other people’s expectations shape your behaviour. ‘Be very careful with how you are training others to see you, because it’s a vicious cycle as people often perform as others expect them to.’ For things that really aren’t that important, like ironing, or sorting out your wardrobe, either delegate and pay someone else to do it if you can afford it, or cut yourself a deal. Do it for 15 minutes or with the promise of a reward. Inspired by this wise advice, I tell my husband that I’m through with procrastinating — he looks dubious rather than encouraging, which is annoying — and put the 15-minute rule into practice. With enough caffeine in the system, it works. Fifteen minutes of most things is bearable and once you’ve started anything you stop worrying about how well you’re doing it, and just get on with it. I tidy the dolls’ house with my daughter (yup, even the dolls’ house is a tip in our house) for 15 minutes. I throw away the mound of bits of paper on my desk — I can’t read my own writing anyway. I send lots of outstanding emails. I pay bills. Procrastination can feel like a treat but actually, as Fiona says, it wears you out. The good news is that you can give it up — so stop putting it off.

"By . Associated Press . and Mailonline Reporter . A 19-year-old man has admitted to running a suburban 'stash house' for a Mexican drug cartel after the enterprise came to light when they allegedly kidnapped and tortured two teens. Antonio Navarro, 19, is one of four men accused of kidnapping two Minneapolis . teens whom they suspected of stealing drugs and money from the house in a . quiet St. Paul neighborhood. Navarro pleaded guilty to conspiring to distribute methamphetamine on Tuesday, clearing the way for the state to proceed on charges including kidnapping, assault and robbery, the Pioneer Press reported. 'Stash house': Four men allegedly kidnapped two teens at gunpoint and tortured them in this home in St Paul, Minnesota in April. The men believed the boys had stolen drugs from them . Navarro and Juan Ricardo Elenes Villalvazo, 32, are accused of keeping the 'stash house' for the cartel, though court documents don't say which one and federal prosecutors declined to comment. Drugs were delivered to the rental house and hidden there along with cash, prosecutors said. Jesus Ramirez, 31, and Jonatan Delgado Alvarez, 22, both of Los Angeles, flew to the Twin Cities in April after meth and $200,000 in cash were stolen from the house, the federal indictment said. Prosecutors say all four men kidnapped two Minneapolis teens, aged 16 and 19, at gunpoint after believing they were responsible for the theft. They then brought them to the house, where they bound and beat and tortured them. They also allegedly threatened their lives and the lives of their relatives. The group also called the victims' relatives, demanding to know where their stash was and threatening their lives. The teens, who have not been identified, were released after the men determined they didn't know what happened to the drugs and money, but not before nearly severing one teen's finger with a scissors as they were interrogating him. Navarro, as well as Ramirez and Alvarez, have been charged in Ramsey County District Court with kidnapping, assault and robbery. That case was put on hold, pending the outcome of the federal charges. Villalvazo, who prosecutors say was responsible for injuring the teen's finger, was still at large.","Antonio Navarro pleaded guilty to conspiring to distribute meth - clearing the way for the state to proceed on kidnapping and assault charges .

"By . Mailonline Reporter . She faces months of treatment 12,000 miles from home - but that hasn't stopped little Madison Merrick from smiling. The four-year-old was born with her bowel outside her body and has travelled from New Zealand to Britain with her mother Alana for the treatment she so desperately needs. She has already been there more than a year and her mother has vowed that they will stay in the city of Birmingham for as long as it takes to find a bowel donor. Little fighter: Madison Merrick, with her mother Alana, is all smiles despite enduring months of treatment for a condition which impacts on every aspect of her life . Alana said: 'A new bowel would mean she could grow up to live normally - otherwise, we’re looking at a lifetime in and out of hospitals. 'It is difficult living away from home for so long and not knowing when we will be returning to New Zealand. 'I love the city and the people here have made us both so welcome. I couldn’t have asked to come to a better place while Madison waits for her treatment.' Madison and Alana, 22, flew to Britain from their home in Auckland in May last year because the surgery the youngster needs is not available in New Zealand. She is being treated at Birmingham Children’s Hospital, which has an international reputation for transplant work. Madison - who is known as Madiee - has spent the last 12 months undergoing a series of tests and has just been placed on the transplant waiting list. But she could have to wait a year or more for an organ to become available. And she will have to stay in Birmingham for at least six months after the procedure to ensure her body does not reject it. The $1million cost of Madison’s treatment is being met by New Zealand’s Ministry of Health, which is also funding her accommodation in Bennetts Hill, close to the hospital. The little girl was born with gastroschisis, in which her small and large intestine sat outside her abdominal wall. She also had a hole in her small bowel. Madison has already had a string of operations but she is unable to eat and has to be fed intravenously. This can cause liver damage over time and so a bowel transplant is her only hope in the long term. Sick from birth: Madison was born with her bowel outside her body and has to be fed intravenously because she is unable to eat . Alana said: 'Madison is such a happy little girl. She loves dancing, dressing up and playing with her dolls and toys. 'But this operation is essential for her to grow up and live a normal life. I have the support of a couple of relatives over here and I have met some wonderful people who have become great friends. 'But I will stay here for as long as is required. Nobody knows how long it will be before the right match comes up. It is a waiting game. 'A transplant would be something worth waiting all the time in the world for.' More...

Alana is raising cash to help pay for living expenses as she is not eligible to work in Britain.

Joanne said: 'Madison is a lovely girl and it has been so difficult for them both to come to a new country on their own.

"By . Lucy Laing . A pregnant doctor who saved her husband's life by diagnosing a deadly blood poisoning condition died just hours later when she contracted the same illness. Craig Stobo said he would have died if his wife Fiona had not suspected he had contracted sepsis after he fell ill. The cause of the illness has still not been established but the hospital is investigating. But as he lay recovering in hospital, just 24 hours later, he was told how how his wife was battling with the same deadly condition which would go on to claim her life and that of their unborn child. Scroll down for video . Craig Stobo has said he could have died if his wife Fiona had not suspected he had contracted sepsis after he fell ill . Mr Stobo is now trying to get on with his life, with the couple's son Robert, three, but he doesn't want his wife's death to be in vain . Mr Stobo, 43, who lives in Edinburgh, said: 'There is no doubt that Fiona saved my life - and I do feel very lucky that she did - although it’s not a life that I would have chosen to come back to. A life without her. 'It was just such a tragedy that she couldn’t save her own too.’ Mr Stobo had woken up one morning in August 2012 feeling unwell. He said: ‘I was feeling dreadful. I’d woken up that morning feeling fine, but by lunchtime I was shivering violently and I felt sick. Mr Stobo was told his wife Fiona was battling with the same deadly condition as he lay recovering in hospital . ‘Fiona was 35 weeks pregnant with our second child and I had been going with her for a scan at the hospital that afternoon, but instead I went home to bed. ‘A few hours later she rang back. She said she was worried about me, and she wanted me to go and see the GP. By this time I was much worse. I couldn’t eat or drink anything and I felt like I was burning up. ‘She came back home and drove me to the GP. I had to lean on her for support when I got out of the car, I was barely registering what was happening as I had a raging temperature.' Mrs Stobo and the GP thought he was suffering from sepsis - a blood infection - so she drove him to Edinburgh Western Hospital. Mr Stobo said: ‘She stayed with me in the evening, but she started shivering. I was worried about her, but she assured me she was just cold and tired. She left before it got too late. 'She was staying with her mum and dad, so she set off to drive home to their house. ‘By the next morning my legs were swollen and I was diagnosed with sepsis - just as Fiona had suspected. ‘I was so grateful to her. Without her quick thinking I wouldn’t still be here. It would have been too late if I had left it any later to get to hospital.’ But later that day, a nurse broke the news to Mr Stobo that Fiona herself was desperately ill in hospital with an infection. He said: ‘I couldn’t take it in.  I was lying in a hospital bed with an infection - and now Fiona was too. But I’d only seen her the night before when she’d sat by my side in this hospital.’ Mrs Stobo had taken a turn for the worse driving home from the hospital. She’d taken painkillers for a headache when she’d arrived at her parents, but within hours they had taken her to hospital. Doctors hadn’t been able to save her unborn baby and Mrs Stobo had to be put on a ventilator. Mr Stobo was put into a wheelchair and taken to the hosital. Mrs Stobo (pictured with her son Robert) had taken a turn for the worse driving home from the hospital. She'd taken painkillers for a headache when she'd arrived at her parents, but within hours they had taken her to hospital . He said: ‘Our daughter Isla was stillborn at 5am and as I held her in my arms it was the most ghastly moment of my life. Just a few days ago we were both on top of the world, looking forward to our new arrival. Now I was holding my lifeless daughter in my arms, with Fiona fighting for her life.’ Mrs Stobo had haemorrhaged after the stillbirth and the infection - the same sepsis infection that had nearly claimed her husband’s life - was now raging through her body. Sepsis occurs when the body responds to infection, and can be caused by a huge variety of bacteria – such as C.diff, E.coli, streptococcus or MRSA. Chemicals released into the blood to combat the  infection trigger widespread inflammation, which leads to blood clots and leaky vessels. Symptoms include a very high or low temperature, fast breathing, racing heartbeat, confusion or slurred speech. The skin may also be cool, pale or mottled, and in advanced stages the patient  can lose consciousness. About 100,000 people are admitted to hospital with sepsis each year. Patients with the condition occupy more than 30 per cent of intensive care unit beds. Mr Stobo said: ‘There were so many doctors and nurses around her, battling to save her life. She was wheeled down to the operating theatre for an operation to try and stop her bleeding, but they couldn’t save her. She had a cardiac arrest on the operating table. ‘I was waiting outside, desperately waiting for news of the operation. When the door opened and I saw the surgeon’s face, I knew then that I had lost her. ‘The next few days were just a blur. I couldn’t believe that I had to go on with my life without Fiona. She was the most amazing person I had ever known.’ Mr Stobo is now trying to get on with his life, with the couple’s three-year-old son Robert, but he doesn’t want his wife’s death to be in vain. He said: ‘The doctors are still investigating our cases as officially they aren’t related. But I’m putting my energies into raising funds to raise more awareness of this condition. 37,000 people die of it each year. ‘Friends and family have stepped in to help with fundraising walks, coffee mornings and triathalons and we have managed to raise £25,000 so far. We are funding a seminar about sepsis and hope to fund more research too. ‘Just a cut, bite or scratch can lead to sepsis developing and I would hate to think of any other family going through what I have been through. It’s my duty to Fiona to try and do something about it, and that’s what I will do.’ For more information visit stopsepsis.org.uk.","Craig Stobo said he could have died if his wife had not diagnosed sepsis .

"By . Lucy Laing . Walking down the aisle without her brother in the church was never going to be easy for Claire Holmes. Russell was just 26 when he was killed by a brain haemorrhage four years ago, and the family is still grieving. But among the congregation, one teenaged girl went some way to filling the gap in the family. Abi Richardson, 18, was facing death in . 2008 - until Russell's family made . the painful decision to donate his organs. Moving: Claire Holmes (right) invited 18-year-old Abi Richardson (left) to be a bridesmaid at her wedding. Abi was given a second chance at life when she received a liver donation from Claire's brother Russell in 2008 . Delighted: Abi (centre) with her mother Sarah Richardson (left) and Russell's mother, Pauline (right) With a second chance at life, she struck up an unusual and touching relationship with the family of her life-saver. And four years later, she was the first person Claire asked to be a bridesmaid at her wedding. It was poignant moment for Russell's mother, Pauline, to see Abi and Claire together - but one that brought her great comfort. Mrs Holmes, 60, who lives in Southampton, said: ‘It was a lovely wedding day. We all missed Russell so much, but having Abi there as bridesmaid, it was almost as though he was here with us, which made me feel better.’ Their remarkable friendship began in 2009, 12 months after Abi had anonymously received Russell’s liver for her lifesaving transplant. Tragic: Russell Holmes was 26 when he died of a brain haemorrhage carrying furniture in 2008 . Although her son did not have a donor card, Mrs Holmes decided to give Russell's organs up for transplant after his death in October 2008. Russell, 26, had been helping some friends move furniture when he collapsed and was rushed to Southampton General Hospital. Mrs Holmes, who works for an administrator for a yacht broker, said: ‘It was devastating. When we arrived at the hospital the doctors told us that he’d suffered this massive brain haemorrhage and there was nothing that could be done for him. ‘I couldn’t take it in. I thought he must be talking about someone else. Russell was only 26 years old, and he had his whole life ahead of him. ‘Now he was lying in a hospital bed with only a machine keeping him alive.’ The doctors asked Mrs Holmes and her ex-husband Trevor, whether they would agree to Russell’s organs being donated for transplant. She said: ‘It was a lot to take in. But then I thought of a friend’s daughter who needed a heart and lung transplant. Russell didn’t have a donor card, but we knew that he would want to help others. We couldn’t waste his life, so we agreed.’ His liver and kidneys were used for donation. Part of his liver went to Abi, another part of it went to another man, one of his kidneys went to a man and another kidney went to a woman. Mrs Holmes said: ‘I didn’t know any of the recipients, but I bought them each a good luck card and asked the hospital to pass them on. I didn’t expect to hear back from any of them. I just hoped that he had managed to help save another four lives.’ Then three months later, she received a letter through the post from Miss Richardson. Mrs Holmes said: ‘It was a lovely letter. She said she was sorry for the loss of my son, but that thanks to him she had another chance at life. She also said that she would like to meet me. Her mum Sarah also wrote to me explaining that Abi had been born with chronic liver disease and had been waiting two years for a transplant. ‘My heart filled with joy. Of course I’d rather still have my son with me, but it felt wonderful knowing that this young girl had a chance at a future because of Russell.’ More letters were sent between them and then a few weeks later, Abi’s mother telephoned Mrs Holmes, and they agreed to meet up in December 2009 at a hotel in Lyme Regis. Transplant: Abi was born with liver disease and faced death aged 13 sitting on a stagnant transplant list . Friendship: She sent a letter, aged 13, to grieving mother Pauline to thank her for a second chance at life . Mrs Holmes said: ‘I didn’t know how I was going to react when I met Abi for the first time, but when I saw her I was so glad that we had agreed to meet. ‘She was beautiful and had blue eyes, just like Russell. I had been worried that I’d find it unsettling, but instead I found it comforting. ‘Abi put her arms around me and thanked me for everything we had done and we all started to cry. It was so emotional. Even though we were strangers, there was this bond between us.’ Since then, their relationship has gone from strength to strength. They speak on the phone every few days - and in May, Abi was asked to be Claire’s bridesmaid. Mrs Holmes said: ‘I’ve come to love Abi as a daughter, so it felt so right having her as Claire’s bridesmaid on her wedding day. She stayed at our house the night before the wedding, and it all felt so right. Like family: Pauline said having Abi there was like having Russell there in spirit at Claire's wedding day this year . ‘It was wonderful to see her standing next to Claire, in her beautiful turquoise dress. ‘Abi’s parents have also asked me to be godmother to their youngest daughter Lily Mai, which is a huge honour. ‘I can’t have my son back but he has given priceless gifts. Abi has gone from a terribly ill girl to a young woman who celebrated her 18th birthday in October. ‘Losing Russell was the hardest thing in the world and I will never get over it, but knowing that my son has given other people a second chance at life makes it that little bit easier. More than 10,000 people in the UK currently need a transplant. Of these, 1000 each year - that’s three people each day - will die.

"By . Lucy Laing . When a morbidly obese new bride looked at her wedding photos - it ended up saving her life. Gemma Martin, 31, from Taunton, Somerset, weighed a staggering 34 stone on her wedding day. She endured walking and breathing difficulties while walking down the aisle due to her size. But it was only when size 32 Gemma saw the wedding photo of herself - and dubbed herself one of the fattest brides in Britain - that she decided to take life saving action. When she walked down the aisle at 34 stone, Gemma had breathing problems (l) she since shed 20 stone . Gemma has managed to shed an incredible 20 stone to date, weighing in at 14 stone and wearing a size 16. She has even managed to have a baby too. She said: 'I'd would have never been able to be a mum when I was so heavy, so its only because I've managed to lose all that weight that I've been able to have my beautiful daughter. 'And it has ended up saving my life too. When I weighed 34 stone, I couldn't breathe properly or walk and I was at risk of getting diabetes too, which would have been lifethreatening. 'So losing all that weight has not only saved my life - but made me a mum too.' Gemma, who lives with husband Paul, 41, a pharmaceutical packaging operator, had struggled with her weight all her life. She said: 'By the age of five I was already chubby, and at the age of ten I weighed 12 stone and needed an adult sized school uniform. Gemma, who lives with husband Paul, 41, always struggled with her weight . 'I was teased at school for being so fat, and I had no friends. I never got invited to any parties and after school I'd hide in my room and cry. My only comfort was eating chocolate and bread.' Gemma tried to diet throughout her teens, but nothing seemed to work. She piled on even more weight. In January 2003 she joined an internet dating site and met Paul. They hit it off and got married in July 2008. Gemma said: 'We had an amazing wedding day with 60 of our close friends and family and it was the happiest day of my life. My mum and Paul told me that I looked lovely, but when the wedding photos came back, I was horrified at how enormous I looked. Gemma, who would have never been able to be a mother when she was so heavy, now has a daughter . 'I felt like I must be one of the fattest brides in Britain. My dress looked too small for me, and I had rolls of fat everywhere. At 34 stone, I was the heaviest that I'd ever been. I gorged on bread - I'd often eat six slices at lunchtime, and then huge portions of dinner in the evenings. 'I knew instantly that I had to start losing weight. I really wanted to have a family with Paul and I knew that if I didn't change, I wouldn't even live long enough to be a mum. Paul said that he loved me whatever I looked like, but he said he would support me throughout it all if I decided to lose the weight.' So Gemma went to see her doctor to ask for help. She was referred for a gastric bypass and the operation took place at Musgrove Hospital in Taunton in January 2011. She said: 'I was nervous before the operation, but I knew that I was doing it for our future.' After the surgery she ate tiny portions of food, and the weight began to drop off. She . said: 'Every month I had to buy smaller and smaller clothes - it felt . like a new me was beginning to emerge from all that day.' It took two years for her to lose a . staggering 14 stone - and during that time, she even fell pregnant. She . gave birth to daughter Saoirse, in January last year. She . said: 'I couldn't believe it when I fell pregnant. I'd suffered from . polycystic ovaries as well, which also caused me to put on weight and . may have meant that I couldn't get pregnant. So when I found out I was . actually pregnant, I was thrilled. In 2003 Gemma joined an internet dating site and met Paul. They hit it off and got married in 2008 . It was amazing, I just kept losing weight throughout my pregnancy, instead of putting any on. I'd lost 13 stone by the time I fell pregnant, and then I lost another stone throughout the pregnancy. 'When she was born it was such an amazing feeling to be a mum at last. When I look at my wedding dress now, I feel proud that it was the inspiration behind my weight loss. 'If I hadn't seen those awful wedding pictures of myself bulging out of it, who knows where I would be today. 'That wedding dress not only saved my life, but it allowed me to become a mum too.' Gemma really wanted to have a family with Paul and knew at her 34st size she wouldn't even live long enough .","Gemma Martin, 31, from Taunton, Somerset, weighed 34st on wedding day .

"By . Lucy Laing . These sisters share more than a winning smile. Grace Simmonds and Scarlett Simmonds have the same birthday and, even more remarkably, the girls were both born on Christmas Day. Grace stunned her mother Kim and her father Lee when she was born nearly four weeks early on December 25, 2009. Grace Simmonds, four, stunned her parents when she made her arrival into the world on Christmas Day in 2009 then sister Scarlett was also born on Christmas Day last year . And a few years later, they were told their second daughter was due to be born on December 28. So imagine their surprise when he sisters beat odds of 133,225 to one to be both born on the same day. Mother Kim, 30, said: 'Christmas Day is a triple celebration in our house - so its a very busy day indeed. 'We are celebrating Christmas, and Grace and Scarlett's birthdays all on the same day. We can't believe that both our girls were born on Christmas Day - it really is a miracle.' When Mrs Simmonds fell pregnant with Grace, she was due the second week of January 2010. She said: 'I'd been given a due date of 13th January and being a first time mum I imagined that she may well be a few weeks late. But I was confident that I would be spending Christmas getting ready for the baby.' Bundle of joy: Grace Simmonds when she made her arrival into the world on Christmas Day in 2009 with mother Kim . Special present: Scarlett born on Christmas Day last year . But when Mrs Simmonds, who lives in Leicester with husband Lee, 38, who runs his own security firm, was 12 weeks pregnant, the baby's head was already engaged. She said: 'The midwife told me that the baby could well come early, and she may even make an appearance at Christmas. I was surprised, but I imagined that it would be after Christmas, perhaps New Year at the earliest.' Mrs SImmonds went to bed on Christmas Eve but in the early hours of the morning she awoke as her waters broke. Mr Simmonds drove her to hospital where they told her that delivery was still a long way off and to come back on Boxing Day. She said: 'When I got home I was in a lot of pain and the contractions were getting stronger. But the doctors had told me it would be the following day when I would finally give birth. The sisters have beaten odds of 133,225 to be both born on the same day. Pictured with mother Kim, 30 . 'By the middle of the afternoon the pain was so intense I couldn't cope with it anymore and I begged Lee to drive me back to hospital.' So the couple returned to Leicester General Hospital and less than three hours later, at 6.50pm she gave birth to baby Grace, weighing a healthy 5Ib15. She said: 'The midwife told me she had always wanted to deliver a Christmas baby. I was still in shock. I couldn't believe I'd delivered her on Christmas Day. She was nearly four weeks early, but luckily she was still healthy. 'I was worried about her being born on Christmas Day but Lee and I both vowed that she wouldn't miss out on attention simply because her birthday was on December 25th.' When Grace had reached her second birthday, the couple decided to try for another baby. Mrs Simmonds said: 'We were aiming for a summer baby this time. One Christmas baby was enough for us.' But in April last year she discovered she was pregnant again - and this time her due date was 28th December. She said: 'I thought the sonographer was joking when she told us the date. Both Lee and I were so shocked. No-one else could believe it either. All the family and friends were joking that we would have another Christmas Day baby. 'When I told Grace we were having another baby she was so excited. She asked whether it could come on her birthday and be a present for her. I never imagined that she would be getting the present she asked for this year.' Two weeks before Christmas, Mrs Simmonds started with mild contractions - but doctors told her that they could continue for weeks. She said: 'I tried to put it to the back of my mind and carry on with the Christmas preparations. I had to hope that this baby would hang on until after Christmas and arrive when she was supposed to do.' But at nearly midnight on Christmas Eve, her contractions got stronger and in the early hours of Christmas morning, Mrs Simmonds was on her way to Leicester Royal Infirmary. She said: 'Lee and I just couldn't believe that we were going to hospital for a second time on Christmas Day.' Baby Scarlett was born at 7.17am - weighing a healthy 6Ib 13oz. Mrs Simmonds added: 'The midwife was so excited as it was the first Christmas Day baby she had ever delivered. When I told her it was our second, she couldn't believe it. We were the talk of the hospital.' Now Scarlett is due to celebrate her first birthday and older sister Grace will celebrate her fourth birthday this Christmas Day. Mrs Simmonds said: I've tried to keep it separate for them this year, and they had their parties a few days before Christmas. We have to do that - or else none of their friends can come. Who wants to come to a birthday party on Christmas Day! 'But the day will be very special. I'm glad my daughters share a birthday.'","Grace Simmonds and Scarlett Simmonds have the same birthday .

"By . Lucy Laing . She was so incredibly fragile when she was born that any ordinary wrapping wouldn’t do. Doctors put tiny Sophia Meechan in bubble wrap to keep her alive after she was born weighing just over a pound. Her chances of survival were slim, but doctors wanted to give her the best possible chance. And now their efforts to save her have all been worthwhile as little Sophia - nicknamed ‘Bub’ by her mother after the bubble wrap that kept her alive - has just started school. Doctors wrapped Sophia in bubble wrap to keep her alive after she was born weighing just over a pound . Mother Rebecca, 39, nicknamed her 'Bub' after the bubble wrap that kept her alive . Her mother, Rebecca, 39, a forensic scientist, said: ‘It was the most emotional day when Sofia started school for the first time. ‘I kept thinking of how far she has come - from being wrapped in bubble wrap to survive - to finally being able to start school. ‘I’ve called her Bub since the day she was born, because of the bubble wrap that saved her life.’ Sophia’s battle for survival began when her mother was just 24 weeks pregnant. She went into premature labour and was rushed to hospital where doctors diagnosed her with an incompetent cervix. Miss Meechan, who lives in Cannock, Staffordshire, said: ‘My pregnancy had been complicated from the beginning. I started bleeding at seven weeks and thought that I was losing Sophia then. ‘She hung on until I got to 24 weeks pregnant. But then I went into labour and doctors diagnosed me with an incompetent cervix which meant I couldn’t hold my baby in my womb any longer.’ The doctors gave Miss Meechan steroid injections to try and develop her baby’s lungs. Efforts to save her have all been worthwhile as Sophia has just started school . She said: ‘I kept begging the doctors to listen to Sophia’s heartbeat to check she was still alive. I was terrified that she was going to die because she was being born so early.' Sophia was delivered by caesarian, weighing just 1Ib8. Doctors warned Miss Meechan that her baby was unlikely to survive. She . said: ‘Her head was so tiny - it was the size of a boiled egg. She just . lay there so small and fragile. I kept thinking how could something so . small possibly survive.’ She . was wrapped in bubble wrap for the first 24 hours of her life, but . doctors didn’t know if she would even survive the night. Plastic . wrapping is used by hospitals to help premature babies retain their body . heat. Sophia remained . on a life support machine for 13 weeks. She then had an operation to . close a valve in her heart, but complications meant that all her organs . started to shut down. Miss Meechan said: ‘That was the lowest point. I . really thought that I was going to lose her, after all these weeks of . fighting. The doctors told me she was struggling to survive. I had to . make a choice whether to let her go or whether to let them try a drug to . keep her alive. But it could leave her with cerebral palsy. ‘I held her and decided that I had to take the risk and let her have the drug.’ Amazingly Sophia hung on and then started to make a recovery without needing the drug. Miss Meechan added: ‘No one could quite believe it. She had been so weak, yet she started to make a recovery without needing to have the drug after all. I was so proud of her.’ During her battle for survival she had to have 15 blood transfusions and had to be resuscitated a dozen times. Sophia remained on a life support machine for 13 weeks. She then had an operation to close a valve in her heart, but complications meant that all her organs started to shut down . Miss Meechan said: 'When she put her school uniform on for the first time, I burst into tears' Sophia was eventually allowed home from hospital after five months. At 12 months she underwent laser eye surgery as her retinas hadn’t developed properly due to her early birth. Since then she has gone from strength to strength. And last month, aged four, she started school for the first time. Miss Meechan said: ‘When she put her school uniform on for the first time, I burst into tears. I couldn’t believe that my bubble wrap baby was actually starting school. She has come on such a long journey.’ Miss Meechan has written a book about Sophia’s battle for survival called ‘My Bubble Wrap Girl - Sophia’s story - which is available on Amazon. She said: ‘I wanted to give support to other mothers who may be in my position and show them that anything is possible. ‘My Bub is proof that something so tiny can survive and go on to live a normal life. She’s been through so much since the day she was born, but she’s fought through it all.’","Sophia Meechan survived after being kept in bubble wrap .

"By . Lucy Laing . Most mothers would be shocked to find out they were expecting twins. But the surprise was more than most for Stacey Wright who gave birth to two sets of twins within 14 months. The 29-year old was stunned when she discovered she was pregnant with her second set of twins - despite being on the contraceptive pill. Miss Wright, who lives in Maidstone, Kent, with her partner Peter Podolski, 28, a doorman, first had sons Harry and Oscar in April 2010. Stacey Wright and her partner Peter Podolski were stunned when they discovered she discovered she was pregnant with her second set of twins - despite being on the contraceptive pill. Sons Harry and Oscar (left to right) arrived in in April 2010 and she had daughters Annie and Eliza (left to right) prematurely in June 2011 . But the following January she was astonished to hear she was pregnant again - with more twins.And she went on to deliver daughters Annie and Eliza prematurely in June 2011. The odds of having two sets of twins are 1 in 700,000 - but having two sets so close together is considered highly unusual. She said: ‘It really was meant to be. ‘To fall pregnant with my second set of twins whilst I was on the contraceptive pill meant that it certainly was fate. ‘To have two sets of twins within 14 months of each other is astounding - and it took a while to sink in.' Miss Wright had been shocked when she . learnt she was expecting her first set of twins, who had been conceived . without fertility treatment. She went for a scan and the sonographer announced that she could see two heart beats. Miss Wright, a full time mother, said: ‘I . wasn’t expecting to be told that I was pregnant with twins. So it was a . shock. But once we got over the shock, I was looking forward to having . two babies.’ The odds of having two sets of twins are 1 in 700,000 - but having two sets so close together is considered highly unusual . Harry and Oscar arrived into the world naturally, weighing 2Ib 13oz, and 4Ib 7oz, at Maidstone Hospital, at 32 weeks into her pregnancy. They were in special care for three weeks before being allowed home. The couple hadn’t been planning on extending their family as Miss Wright was then diagnosed with abnormal pre-cancerous cells in her cervix, and she had to undergo treatment to remove them. She said: ‘It was scary. I had two baby boys, and I was having to have treatment to stop these cells growing into full blown cancer.’ But then, despite being on the contraceptive pill, Miss Wright discovered she was pregnant in January 2011. She said: ‘It was a shock as we hadn’t been trying for another baby and I was still on the pill. When I saw the test result showing positive I was in shock and so was Peter. ‘I was worried that we were having another baby when the twins were so little. But at that stage we never imagined that it could be twins again.’ Miss Wright, who lives in with her partner Peter Podolski, a doorman, said: 'It really was meant to be. 'To fall pregnant with my second set of twins whilst I was on the contraceptive pill meant that it certainly was fate' But when Miss Wright went to the hospital for a scan, the sonographer ran the scanner over her stomach, and told the couple that it was twins again. Miss Wright said: ‘I was happy, but I burst into tears again. I was so worried about how I was going to cope with two sets of twins, born so close together. There aren’t any sets of twins in either of our families, so we just don’t know where they came from.’ Miss Wright’s pregnancy went smoothly until 25 weeks into her pregnancy when she went into early labour. Her twins girls Annie and Eliza were born naturally in June 2011 weighing a tiny 1Ib 9oz and 1Ib 8oz. Doctors gave them steroid injections to try and help develop their lungs before the birth. She said: ‘I was so terrified when I went into premature labour with the girls. I was only 25 weeks pregnant and I didn’t know whether they would survive. ‘When I saw them lying there afterwards in their incubators, they were so tiny. Their skin was translucent, and they weren’t much bigger than the palm of my hand. Miss Wright has to change nappies 16 times a day, she pushes the twins around all together in a four seater buggy, and the family have a seven seater car to get around on family outings . ‘It was nice because the nurses looking after them were the same nurses who had looked after my boys when they were born too.’ Eliza had a malformation in one of her veins which meant that she risked having a brain haemorrage, but she was carefully monitored. The twins gradually got stronger and after three months they were finally allowed home from hospital, weighing 3Ib and 4Ib. Miss Wright said: ‘They were still tiny when we brought them home, but they are such little fighters and are going from strength to strength. Miss Wright has to change nappies 16 times a day, she pushes the twins around all together in a four seater buggy, and the family have a seven seater car to get around on family outings. She added: ‘It is hard work but I love being a mum to two sets of twins. People are always stopping and asking me about them. They can’t believe it when I tell them that both sets of twins were born just 14 months apart. ‘But that is definitely it for me - we aren’t planning any more additions to our family. Two sets of twins is more than enough for anyone.’","Stacey Wright, 29, from Kent, had sons Harry and Oscar in April 2010 .

"By . Sam Webb . Katarzyna Gacek, who has been jailed for 20 months for perverting the course of justice over the death of her son, seven week-old Thomas . A young mother who was accused of killing her baby has escaped the blame for his violent death after she concocted a 'pack of lies' with her boyfriend and landlord to cover it up. Katarzyna Gacek, 24, of Oldham, Greater Manchester, was charged after seven week-old son Thomas died in hospital having been admitted with multiple injuries consistent with being squeezed beaten and shaken. But although she, her boyfriend Darren Butterfield, 35, and landlord Dawid Mokrzanowski, 26, all lied about the circumstances leading up to the youngster’s death, all escaped culpability for the tragedy after a legal technicality meant it was impossible to prove who caused the baby’s injuries. Initially, the trio had all signed a statement falsely claiming Thomas was injured accidentally when Gacek slipped and dropped him on a flight of stairs before falling on top of him. But CCTV showed Gacek out shopping on the day of her son’s death - leaving him at home with her landlord who subsequently said the baby had injured himself accidentally in his cradle. It was then claimed Gacek had waited ten hours before taking her fatally injured son to hospital while she and Mokrzanowski researched head injury symptoms on Google as Butterfield looked on. Medical evidence later showed the fatal injury was inflicted on Thomas closer to the time of his admission to hospital. At Preston Crown Court, Gacek, Butterfield and Mokrzanowski had all faced trial accused of allowing or causing the death of a baby but a judge halted the case after ruling it could not be proved who caused the injuries to Thomas - or when they were caused. Gacek's boyfriend Darren Butterfield and landlord Dawid Mokrzanowski were also sentenced to 20 months . He ordered jurors to return not guilty verdicts on all three and also ordered them to acquit Mokrzanowski on a separate charge of manslaughter. All were instead jailed for 20 months each for perverting the course of justice by providing the false statement. The verdicts meant the truth behind little Thomas’ death may now remain a mystery. Gacek had originally been charged with murder. Earlier the jury was told Gacek had moved to the UK from her native Poland in 2010 but had no contact with Thomas’s father Michal Szarek, 36, who was initially unaware the child was his. Mokrzanowski, 26, lived with Gacek and Thomas and often acted as carer for her son, as did Butterfield, a frequent visitor to the address. Tragedy struck just a week after Thomas was examined by a health visitor on January 17 and was found to be a healthy, growing baby with no medical problems. Loss: Floral tributes and soft toys left at the home in Oldham after Thomas' death . On January 25 he was admitted to Royal Oldham Hospital with multiple bruises all over his body, severe retinal bleeding in both eyes and was noted to be pale, unresponsive and having a seizure. He was transferred to Manchester Children’s Hospital but was pronounced dead two days later. Tests showed he had 22 bruises four broken ribs and bleeding on the brain. Initially when Gacek took Thomas to hospital she told nurses she had been alone in the house with Thomas all day and was carrying him up the stairs when she slipped on a rug and dropped him. She claimed she was unable to stop herself falling on top of the baby and causing him severe injuries. When Gacek took Thomas to hospital she told nurses she had been alone in the house with Thomas all day and was carrying him up the stairs when she slipped on a rug and dropped him . But staff at the hospital suspected serious non-accidental injury and contacted police. Gacek Butterfield and Mokrzanowski agreed to sign statements verifying her account of what happened. But officers investigated further and CCTV captured her visiting Oldham town centre on her own January 25 leaving Thomas at home. Butterfield was captured on cameras boarding a bus and arriving at the house at 2pm - seven hours earlier than he originally stated. All three later admitted their initial account was false and accepted Gacek was not alone with Thomas and did not fall while carrying him. Mokrzanowski later told police he had been in the house between 9am and 1pm but had been unaware he was supposed to be caring for Thomas until he heard him crying. He then brought the baby downstairs and placed him in a plastic rocking cradle and rocked him to sleep. Gacek then returned to find her son had a cut and bruise to his lip and confronted Mokrzanowski who claimed he too fell asleep himself and the boy must have accidentally banged his mouth on the frame of his rocking cradle. Butterfield said the group sat on a sofa and using Google to research and the read out ‘brain concussion of a child symptoms’ and ‘baby staring in one place.’ During the trial prosecutor Raymond Wigglesworth QC said the jury was entitled to ask whey they had told 'a pack of lies' and added: 'Why did the three defendants agree to lie about what happened to Thomas? 'Was it because they feared the Social Services coming in asking questions or was there some other motive for shielding the truth from the hospital staff and police? 'We know at some stage someone within that household unlawfully caused injury to Thomas either by striking him or squeezing him, causing four fractures to the ribs on the left side of his body.' He said Thomas’s body was examined by a number of medical experts including a consultant paediatrician who concluded the number of bruises - 25 different sites - were 'suggestive of inflicted injuries and are not consistent with accidental injuries to a non-mobile baby'. He added: 'In particular she noted that the injuries to both ears were unusual and would suggest either an impact with a hard surface or that he had been slapped across the face.' The post-mortem examination also revealed that Thomas had four fractured ribs said to have been caused in the days before he suffered the fatal head injury. The post-mortem examination also revealed that Thomas had four fractured ribs and medical experts said he had 25 bruises . Mr Wigglesworth said the expert view was that the most probable cause was non-accidental and the amount of force required would be 'considerable, even on a baby of this age'. After the case David Lees Crown Advocate for CPS North West said: 'On 26th January 2014, a seven week-old baby boy was admitted to Royal Oldham Hospital with head injuries, where he tragically died the next evening. 'Following an investigation by Greater Manchester Police a senior crown prosecutor conducted a thorough review of the evidence. 'A decision was made that the baby’s mother Katarzyna Gacek and her partner Darren Butterfield should be prosecuted for causing or allowing the death of a child, and their landlord Dawid Mokrzanowski prosecuted for manslaughter. 'The case proceeded to trial at Preston Crown Court and commenced on 9th July 2014. 'As the trial progressed it became apparent that the medical evidence was now suggesting that the fatal injury was inflicted much later in the day than previously thought and closer to the time of the baby’s admission to hospital. 'As a result we could no longer prove to the very high criminal standard who was responsible for inflicting that injury, nor that Ms Gacek and Mr Butterfield by either act or omission had caused or allowed the death to occur.' Senior Investigating Officer Duncan Thorpe from the Major Incident Team said: 'Gacek, Mokrzanowski and Butterfield all colluded together to hide the truth of what really happened to baby Thomas that night. He had been subjected to abusive head trauma caused by violent shaking and suffered a number of other injuries including fractured ribs. 'This has been a very sad and difficult investigation for all those involved.' In a statement, Thomas’ family said: 'As a family we are all truly devastated and deeply shocked by the tragedy we have all suffered and the loss of our little baby boy.'","Katarzyna Gacek gave false statement over death of baby son Thomas .

The beauty is also an avid reader and counts the Harry Potter series and tear-jerker, Fault in Our Stars as some of her favorite reads. Biggest fan: Brommel has followed her boyfriend and his German team-mates across Brazil over the past month and is seen here watching his team's narrow 2-2 draw with Ghana in Jun . Beginning modelling at the age of 16, Brommel hails from Emmerich in the northwest of Germany and is surely set to step into the big-time now that her boyfriend has achieved lasting international fame. Gotze played for Borussia Dortmund between 2009 and 2013, winning the Bundesliga title in 2010-11, and was a member of the team which reached the 2013 Champions League Final. In April 2013, the committed Christian moved to Bayern Munich for £29million, making him the second-most expensive German player, behind Mesut Ozil, who moved to Arsenal for a club-record fee of £42.5 million. Gotze earns an estimated £5.5m at the club. The moment that will echo through eternity: The moment he put the ball past Argentinian keeper Romero to secure the victory . Former German Football Association's technical director Matthias Sammer describes Gotze as: 'One of the best talents that [Germany's] ever had.' He played in his first match for Germany against Sweden, on November 17, 2010, coming on in the 78th minute in a goalless draw, making him the youngest German international since Uwe Seeler. Interestingly, Gotze, along with André Schürrle who ran onto the pitch at the same time, is the first German players to be born in a reunified Germany.

"By . Sam Webb . Breach of trust: Richard Jones arriving at Manchester Crown Court where he was jailed for eight years. The RE teacher kissed and groped a vulnerable teenage pupil . A RE teacher carried on a sexual relationship with a pupil despite his suspension by education bosses while an inquiry took place, a court has heard. Colleagues of Richard Jones, 57, passed on their concerns to the authorities about his 'improper' behaviour but he ignored the 'shot across the bows' as the abuse of the vulnerable teenager continued. His crimes were uncovered weeks later last summer when the girl’s family discovered sexually graphic email exchanges between the pair and reported the matter to police. Jones, of Gorton Road, Stockport, was arrested and later charged with a number of sexual offences. The investigation led to another child victim coming forward who said Jones had sexually abused her in the 1970s. Jones was today jailed for a total of eight years after he admitted a string of sexual offences against both victims. Manchester Crown Court heard that a teenage pupil at his South Manchester high school, which cannot be named for legal reasons, came to him for emotional support over personal problems. But Jones exploited her being flattered by his attention as he set up regular one-to-one meetings in his classroom which eventually led to her being kissed and groped. The relationship developed as the pair began to meet in secret in a secluded area of a local park where more sexual activity took place. On one such occasion her family gained access to her computer when they could not track her down and found the explicit conversations. It emerged that about three weeks earlier Jones had been suspended by the school after fellow teachers had flagged up their concern about the relationship. One had reported that Jones had been seen sitting 'inappropriately close' to her in his classroom before the school day had started. When arrested, Jones made no comment. The girl told police that they had both fallen in love with each other and that Jones had suggested they go to his home city of Liverpool to have sex but she had refused. Jones pleaded guilty on the day of his scheduled trial to four counts of sexual activity with a child and and one count of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity. He also admitted seven counts of indecent assault in the historical case in the Liverpool area which involved a girl aged under 13. The investigation led to another child victim coming forward who said Jones had sexually abused her in the 1970s, Manchester Crown Court (pictured) heard . Sentencing him, Judge Robert Atherton noted the defendant had carried on seeing the pupil even when he received the 'shot across the bows' of the suspension. He said: 'Unfortunately you did not then desist from seeing her and continued to see her and made arrangements so that her family believed she was in one place when she in fact was in a totally different place with you. That in my judgment was a severe breach of trust. 'She was clearly a vulnerable girl. She came to you for support and no doubt felt you were in a position to give her that support. But you betrayed her. 'While it is clear that she did not protest against your sexual activities with her it is also clear that you must have been grooming her in those days and weeks over which this all occurred.' The judge said Jones was 'extremely fortunate' that his wife, who was in court, and their children were standing by him and continued to support him. Jones was sentenced to six years for the Manchester offences and two years for the Liverpool offences. He will be on the Sex Offenders Register for life and is also banned from working with children.","Richard Jones, 57, was warned about his 'improper behaviour' with teenager .

A Harris County tactical response team took over with a truck they call 'The bBear', which pinned down Haskell's using another truck, military MRAP (Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected), at the rear. Negotiations then began, lasting three hours. 'So we sort of had him trapped where we had him, to where we could force him to talk to us and negotiate with us,' said Sgt. Lonnie Tullos, who headed the operation. A bomb robot took water to Haskell, and a second cell phone was also delivered to his car after his went flat. Haskell, who at times held a gun to his head, eventually surrendered. 'Our main function is the preservation of life, and that's all life,' said Coleman. 'To try to get this remedy done in as peaceable a fashion as we can, I think we accomplished the mission the best way we could.' 'The guys are highly trained and dedicated and very patient.
