The number of women in their 30s having an abortion has soared – fuelling concerns that many assume they can continue with their careers before later resorting to IVF. Terminations carried out on those aged 30 to 34 has increased by nearly 6 per cent – a steeper rise than in any other age group. In contrast, abortions carried out on women under 20 has fallen, figures by the Department of Health show. Experts said one reason was many 30-something women believe they could delay motherhood by using IVF in their 40s. Pregnancy scare: The number of abortions in England and Wales has risen for the second year running, according to the Department Of Health . Only last week it emerged that women in their early 40s could be given fertility treatment for free on the NHS despite success rates at this age being low. Josephine Quintavalle, of pressure group Comment on Reproductive Ethics, said: ‘At some stage these women are going to decide they really want children and then by that stage it may be too late. 'Meeting women's needs': Ann Furedi said that there was no 'right' number of abortions . ‘It just seems to be abortion on demand. It’s like a form of contraception. ‘Without making judgement, you would think that by this age women should know better. It may be that because IVF is available they can always delay having a baby.’ Last year there were 29,579 abortions carried out on women aged 30 to 34 compared with 27,978 in 2010 – a rise of 1,601. In contrast, the number of those aged between 25 and 29 rose by under 4 per cent, from 40,800 in 2010 to 42,321 last year. For all age groups, 189,931 terminations were carried out in 2011 – an increase of 0.2 per cent in a year. Around 36 per cent  were carried out on women who had had an  abortion. Only last week it emerged that some teenagers have already had eight abortions, fuelling  concerns many think of it as a form  of contraception. Figures revealed under the Freedom of Information Act showed that 5,300 girls last year had a ‘repeat’ abortion. Ann Furedi, of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, said: ‘Abortion is a service that a third of women will need in the course of their reproductive lifetimes so they can plan the timing and size of their families, and play a role in society. By age: The percentage of women who had one of more abortions in England and Wales in 2011 . ‘There is no “right” number of abortions above and beyond ensuring that every woman who needs to end an unwanted pregnancy can do so.’ Julie Bentley, of the Family Planning Association, said: ‘The number of abortions hasn’t changed significantly in the past few years and this is to be welcomed. ‘However, we do know cracks are beginning to appear in contraception services. If we are going to bring down abortion numbers, this needs to change. Contraception is an essential not a luxury.’ Public health minister Anne Milton said: ‘Having an abortion can be traumatic and stressful and should never be seen as a form of contraception.’ Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists vice president David Richmond, said: ‘We need to continue to reduce the need for abortion in  the first place particularly for  repeat abortions.’","There were 189,931 abortions performed for women resident in England and Wales in 2011 .
This was a 0.2% rise on 2010 and 7.7% rise on 2001 .

"By . Helen Pow and Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 10:25 EST, 28 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:25 EST, 28 March 2013 . A fourth high school football player has been charged in a statutory rape case involving two 13-year-old girls who've been taunted online by supporters of the accused. The 17-year-old boy from Torrington was charged Wednesday with second-degree assault and risk of injury to a minor in connection with an alleged January incident. Three other Torrington High School football team members were charged with similar crimes within the past two months. The boy's name is being withheld because of his age, and his case is being handled in juvenile court. Details of his arrest are sealed from public view. Hazing: Gonzalez, pictured center, was charged in a March 2012 alleged felony robbery that Toribio, left, wasn't embroiled in it appears . School officials say the boy arrested Wednesday has been suspended from school. Officials are continuing to warn students that online bullying will not be tolerated and could lead to suspension or expulsion. All three boys who were previously arrested, two 18-year-olds and one 17-year-old, have been suspended from school, pending expulsion. The 18-year-old suspects include football players Edgar Gonzalez and Joan Toribio. The 17-year-old is not being named. Meanwhile, the alleged victims . continue to attend classes despite being the subject of horrific social . media slurs from fellow students since the allegations against the . footballers were made public. The girls have been labeled 'whores,' 'hoes,' and 'snitches' in tweets, that have been reposted by scores of . teenagers. One Twitter user excused the shocking alleged rape as . boys 'acting like boys' and said he'd tweet the 'exact same thing about . what happened in Ohio.' Torrington police revealed yesterday . at a press conference that family members reported the . alleged abuse the day after it is believed to have taken place. The 17-year-old suspect is considered . a minor and his case was referred to juvenile court. No details of the allegations have been released. Lt. Michael Emanuel said there were 'possibly' more arrests coming. 'It's very complex, but (the case is) under control,' Emanuel said. Insisting that he was 'not minimizing this,' he stressed that the 13-year-olds knew the accused. He said the incidents are being investigated as sexual assaults because of the significant age gap between the alleged victims and the older boys. Accused: Torrington High School football players . Edgar Gonzalez, pictured left, and Joan Toribio, right. both 18, are . accused of felony second-degree sexual assault and other crimes . 'It was consensual in the sense that it was not an attack but not consensual in the eyes of the law,' Emanuel said at the news conference. Toribio was initially charged last month with three felonies including . second-degree sexual assault, risk of injury to a child, and risk of . injury to a minor (sexual contact). But on March 4 he was charged again . with second-degree sexual assault and risk of injury to a child in . connection with an incident that took place earlier that same day. He has pleaded not guilty and has posted $100,000 bail. His friend, Gonzalez, who was named . Most Valuable Player, was charged with second-degree sexual assault, . risk of injury to a child, and risk of injury to a child (sexual . contact) in the February 10 incidents. He has also pleaded not guilty . and remains on $65,000 bail at the New Haven Correctional Center. Torrington High School athletics . director Mike McKenna has been criticized for minimizing the alleged . assaults, suggesting they are the type of thing that happen 'anywhere.' 'Much like anywhere, there are kids . that get in trouble, kids that do dumb things and get in trouble, . sometimes bad trouble,' he said yesterday, according to the Hartford . Courant. Valuable: Edgar Gonzalez, pictured, was voted Most Valuable Player . Isolated: Torrington athletics director has . insisted the incidents are isolated and not indicative of a sordid . culture within the football team . The Register Citizen, . which broke the story, named and shamed the classmates who bullied the . alleged victims on social media. Today the newspaper defended this decision, . claiming that publishing their identities gave the country a taste of how . 'horrifying and uncomfortable' the past few weeks have been for the . 13-year-old girls. 'Vaguely summarizing this kind of . bullying, identities protected, would have allowed the school district . to continue to ignore the problem and the community to assume that it . was 'someone else's kid,' group editor Matt DeRienzo said in an editorial. 'But the fact is that ""good kids,"" from ""good homes,"" honor roll students, athletes, male, female, . participated in this stuff, and showed a fundamental and staggeringly . dangerous misunderstanding about rape, consent and how to treat other . people.' Many of the bullies had made their Twitter accounts private or deleted them by mid morning. Police said at the conference that they weren't aware of the nasty tweets until detectives read them in the Citizen on Wednesday but would investigate them. 'We don't have any information on that (bullying),' Emanuel said. 'Of course if there is any information we'd like to bring it forward and our detectives would like to take a look at that.' The news of the alleged sexual . assault yesterday came just days after two star football players in . Steubenville were convicted of rape in a case that shook the nation. As well as being called a 'whore' and criticized for 'snitching'  the 13-year-olds have been blamed for 'ruining' the lives of the popular players. Bullying: The victim has been called a 'whore,' criticized for 'snitching' and blamed her for 'ruining' the players' lives . Twitter: The 13-year-old has been targeted by dozens of Torrington classmates who are angry about the allegations . Ohio: The case mirrors one in Steubenville, where two football players were convicted this week of raping a girl who was later threatened online . One Twitter user wrote: 'Young girls . acting like whores there's no punishment for that young boys acting like . boys is a sentence.' After The Citizen . published his tweet, the same user wrote multiple tweets blaming the . girls for getting themselves in that situation before insisting that he . 'would tweet the same exact thing about what happened in Ohio.' Another . bully tweeted: 'Even if it was all his fault, what was a 13-year-old . girl doing hanging around 18 year old guys..' The tweet was reposted 11 . times and received six favorites. A . judge has ordered details of the Connecticut allegations to be sealed . from public view. This tends to happen in the state when a case is still . under investigation, and when a young victim is involved. The . warrants will remain sealed for 15 days at which point a hearing will . be held to decide whether the details will be made public, according to . the Citizen. The truly disturbing case echoes the . one in Steubenville, where two football players were convicted this week . of raping a girl who was later threatened online. Gonzalez . and three other Torrington football players were also embroiled in a . hazing scandal last year but police now say the investigation is closed. Coach: Athletic Director Mike McKenna said the incidents were not reflective of the culture of the football team . Culture: Both this and the Ohio rape case have raised questions about the football culture in local high schools . Gonzalez . was charged in a March 2012 alleged felony robbery after he and three . others allegedly jumped three 14-year-olds in search of money. Jeffrey . Holder, 19, a former Torrington High School football player, was also . charged but the other two co-conspirators were not identified because of . their age. Gonzalez pleaded not guilty in that case. Former Head Coach Dan Dunaj, who resigned in December, allowed Gonzalez to play in 2012, despite the charges. He . told the Citizen yesterday that he 'reeled the kid in' when he became . aware of the pending robbery charges against Gonzalez 'and he walked the . line. As a coach I was doing something right.' Dunaj said, however, that sexual . assault charges are a different matter, insisting he would kick the . 18-year-old off the team if he were still in the role and Gonzalez had . another season ahead of him. 'My . process has always been like this, and I learned this from my high . school coach, and I never got into any big trouble, thank God, but if . you didn't give the kid a chance then who's going to,' Dunaj told the . newspaper. McKenna insisted the incidents are isolated and not indicative of a sordid . culture within the football team. Bullying: The victim has been bullied on social media after the allegations against Toribio, pictured, and Gonzalez . Sealed: Details of the allegations against the two friends have been sealed from public view . 'If you think there's some wild . band of athletes that are wandering around then I think you're . mistaken,' he told the Citizen. According to McKenna, a student . athlete would be suspended from play for a 'serious infraction.' However, he couldn't say whether a felony or a misdemeanor would be . enough. He told the newspaper that he personally considered a violent felony worthy of a suspension. In Steubenville, head coach Reno Saccoccia may face charges for his failure to report the shocking rape by quarterback Trent Mays, 17, and wide receiver Ma'lik Richmond, 16. He allegedly told the two star players that he'd 'make it go away,' referring to the allegations, rather than telling police. Both cases have raised questions about the football culture in local high schools. A comment on the Citizen's story reads: 'The power of the football team. Be a good athlete and you can do no wrong.' Scores of MailOnline readers voiced similar opinions after our original story was published yesterday. The victim in the Ohio case has been viciously tormented on social media by other teens. Yesterday it emerged that two girls, aged 15 and 16, who are facing charges for allegedly issuing death threats to the girl will stay in custody pending trial to protect the victim. Toribio is scheduled to be in court April 23. Gonzalez is scheduled to be back in court on April 2.","A 17-year-old Torrington High School football player is charged with sexually assaulting at least one 13-year-old girl last fall .

A Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist is preparing for one of the most ambitious reporting projects ever undertaken - a seven-year trek across the globe to retrace the steps taken by early man tens of thousands of years ago. Paul Salopek will create 'a family portrait of humanity' as he documents the 21,000-mile journey over four continents, from the Great Rift Valley in Ethiopia to the most southerly point in South America. The epic route will follow the footsteps of early humans who left Africa 70,000 years ago  and spread into Europe, Asia, Australasia and the Americas. Scroll down for video . Epic: Map of Paul Salopek's 21,000-mile route (red), with the pattern of prehistoric human migration (white) The experienced journalist, who will . take an estimated 30 million steps along the way, will cross the Red Sea . into the Middle East before traveling through China to Siberia. He will cross the Bering Strait into Alaska and walk the western coast of North and South America. Salopek, who sets off next month, will pass through some of the world's most dangerous political hotspots, including Iran and central America. He will post regular multimedia updates on a website, wrote for National Geographic and  film and record his changing surroundings and the people he meets - storing footage on an online database every 100 mile.

He will consider . humans' prehistoric ancestry while documenting modern populations and aims to develop the real stories of the . people and places he comes across. US-born Salopek, who also writes for the Chicago Tribune, sees himself as carrying on the ancient human tradition of the roving poet or musician. He told The Observer: 'It's the old way of story telling: The wandering bard. I am curious myself to see how it all turns out. 'It is the notion of a questing story . which we find in all cultures, that you have to go away from home and . come back in order to truly discover what 'home' was.' Mountainous task: Ethiopia's Great Rift Valley is the starting point for the seven-year trek . Salopek believes the mental challenges will be tougher than the physical obstacles. He face lengthy periods of solitude but will also be joined for some of the journey by his wife Linda Lynch, a visual artists. The Out of Eden Walk, which is backed the Knight Foundation, Harvard's Neiman Foundation for Journalism and the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, is the latest in a long list of daring reporting by Salopek. His previous assignments include venturing 1,300 miles across Mexico on a mule, canoeing through the Congo and traveling to Sudan, where he was arrested for being a spy. Salopek, who won a Pulitzer Prizes for explanatory reporting in 1998 and for international reporting in 2001, said: 'I have moved around my whole life. I am very good at moving through different cultural membranes and I feel that I have been unconsciously preparing for this for many years.'

A mother advised to abort her baby daughter after scans showed her organs were on the outside of her body has spoken of her relief that she saved her. Nine-month-old Piper Smith was given just a 25 per cent chance of survival when she was born with her bladder, intestine and liver outside her body. Her mother Amanda Smith, 29, was told she should consider aborting her unborn child after a rare weakness of the abdominal wall was spotted at her 11 week scan. It meant unborn Piper grew in the womb with the organs outside her body - and was not expected to survive labour. Fighting: Nine-month-old Piper Smith (with mother Amanda) was given just a 25 per cent chance of survival when she was born with her bladder, intestine and liver outside her body . Survivor: Piper undergoing treatment in London's Great Ormond Street Hospital. Her bladder, which is outside her body, is wrapped in cling-film to keep her alive . But remarkably, she was successfully born at 35 weeks with all her organs intact and fully-functioning. She is now being kept alive with cling film which keeps her organs in place and moist. Mrs Smith and her husband Wayne, 23, are now waiting for surgeons to perform a six-hour operation to put Piper's organs back inside her body and then stretch muscle over her stomach. After that, she is expected to have a good quality of life, making her mother even more relieved she chose not to have her daughter aborted. Mrs Smith, a mother-of-two, from King's Lynn, Norfolk, said: 'The doctors offered me a termination, but I didn't feel I could have one - I wanted to give her a chance. And she has been a miracle. She is a little fighter.' Medics diagnosed her unborn baby with two conditions - bladder exstrophy and exomphalos  - after spotting unusual lumps on her scan at 11 weeks. Doctors said the foetus was unlikely . to survive, even if she made it through childbirth but Mr and Mrs Smith . decided to keep her. Mrs Smith added: 'It was really scary when Piper was born. She was very poorly. It was like she was inside out. 'It was really hard as I wasn't allowed to pick her up as she had to go straight in to the incubator. 'The doctors said she had a 50 per cent chance of survival with her intestine and liver outside the body [a condition known as exomphalos]. Doctors said Piper had a 50 per cent chance of survival with her intestine and liver outside the body. When they saw her bladder was outside, this fell to 25 per cent . In her short life Piper has already been in intensive care twice . Mrs Smith and her husband Wayne, 23, are now waiting for surgeons to perform a six-hour operation to put Piper's organs back inside her body and then stretch muscle over her stomach . 'When they saw the bladder was outside too [bladder exstrophy] they said it went down to 25 per cent. It was terrifying thinking she might not make it.' In the meantime, Piper's liver and intestine are still outside her body, but skin has grown over them making it look like she has a hernia. She is also living with her bladder sitting on the outside of her stomach - wrapped in cling film to keep it moist. Mrs Smith was due to be induced at 38 weeks, but was rushed by ambulance to specialists at University College Hospital, London, at 35 weeks, on June 26. Piper spent four days in intensive . care and was eventually sent home from Great Ormond Street . Hospital after five weeks. But at eight weeks she was rushed back to Great Ormond Street with a twist in her bowel and spent five days in intensive care. Piper, . who also suffers from spina bifida - which her family hopes will be . correctable - will need a colostomy bag to pass solids until she is at . least four-years-old. Her . mother said: 'I don't think Piper is aware of her organs being on the . outside rather than on the inside. She is not in any pain. 'She is starting to sit up now and . she is a very happy baby. We are really hoping that she will be able to . walk eventually. I have to check on Piper more than a normal baby - she . cannot roll on her side as her organs are there so we have to be very . careful.' Relief: Piper's mother was told she should consider aborting her unborn child after a rare weakness of the abdominal wall was spotted at her 11 week scan . After surgery Piper is expected to have a good quality of life and her parents hope that her spina bifida will be correctable . Mrs Smith has to change the . cling-film dressing on Piper's bladder every time she changes her nappy - . about five times a day. Cling film is used to wrap Piper's bladder as it reduces the amount of fluids and body heat lost from her abdomen. She said: 'It is amazing that a household product like cling film is doing such an important job and keeping Piper alive. 'We have to change the cling film every time we change Piper's nappy so that is about five times a day. 'The hospital gave us industrial size cling film rolls so we have enough supplies. We keep rolls of it in our changing bag.' Doctors have told Piper's parents it is rare to suffer from both conditions. Bladder exstrophy, a congenital birth defect, occurs in one in every 40,000 births and affects two to three times more boys than girls. It is not known what causes bladder exstrophy, but the problem occurs somewhere between the fourth and tenth week of pregnancy when various organs, tissues and muscles begin to form layers that separate, divide and fold. The skin over the lower abdominal wall does not form properly, so the bladder is open and exposed on the outside of the abdomen. Exomphalos, the other condition she suffers from, affects one in every 2,500 children born each year, occurs when a child's abdominal wall does not develop fully while in the womb.","Amanda Smith, was told at 11-week scan she should .

An obese New Yorker named in court as a Gambino gangster appeared on TV show The Biggest Loser hoping to shed some weight, it emerged today. Two witnesses at the racketeering and murder trial of Bartolomeo (Bobby) Vernace claimed Robert Iovane, nicknamed Big Head, was a member of Vernace's mob. In 2006 he featured in a special edition of the reality diet show when he teamed up with relatives who owned an Italian restaurant in the Bronx. Fat-fighter: Robert Iovane, nicknamed Big Head, appearing in The Biggest Loser with members of his family . Joseph Gambina testified that Iovane engaged in illegal sports gambling and loansharking . A source revealed the 45-year-old had been laying low for a number of years, but his brush with fame didn't go unnoticed in Mob Land, the New York Daily News reported. According to the witnesses, he was instantly recognised for being part of Vernace's crime crew which operated out of a Queens café. Former Bonanno mobster Joseph (Giuseppe) Gambina told the court his criminal dealings with Iovane included illegal sports betting and loansharking. Assistant U.S. Attorney Evan Norris asked him: 'Did you ever see him on TV?' 'Yes,' Gambina replied. 'I was watching TV at 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning and I saw him on that show, The Big Fat Loser.' Gambina said he was 'close' to Vernace, who's charged with the 1981 murders of two bar owners, Richard Godkin and John D’Agnese, allegedly killed over a spilled drink. The court heard that Iovane was a member of Vernace's crime crew that operated out of a Queens café . The family restaurant in the Bronx featured in the episode of The Biggest Loser Robert Iovane was in . Iovane's alleged criminal activities occurred in the 1990s . Another mobster, Howard Santos, had testified previously that Iovane was a 'flashy guy' who ran an illegal poker game called Squeeze, the New York Daily News reported. 'I mean he would whip out stacks of money like this thick and show off,' Santos said. Assistant U.S. Attorney Amir Toossi asked him how Iovane got his nickname. 'Because he's got a big head,' Santos said. Iovane was allegedly 'close' to Vernace, who's charged with the 1981 murders of two bar owners, Richard Godkin and John D¿Agnese .

Iovane's alleged criminal activities occurred in the 1990s, but a source said he hasn't been around Vernace's place in years and dropped out of sight until appearing in the TV show. He worked in the relatives' restaurant and also operated landscaping businesses in Queens and Long Island. An old police photo shows Bartolomeo Vernace, the man on trial for two murders . 'He doesn't want to talk to nobody,' a man identifying himself as Iovane's brother told the New York Daily News before hanging up the phone.

'My client has never been involved in any criminal activity, or had knowledge of any criminal activity, at any time,' said lawyer Robert Jannuzzi.

A three-year-old boy adopted by a West Texas couple had more than 30 bruises and other marks on his body as well as signs that he was routinely injured by accident, according to an autopsy report released Tuesday. Russian authorities have blamed Max Alan Shatto's death on abusive treatment by his adoptive parents, despite West Texas authorities' insistence that the boy's death was an accident. An Ector County grand jury has declined to indict the parents, Alan and Laura Shatto, who also adopted his half brother, Kristopher. The autopsy report released to the Odessa American suggests that the Shattos were struggling to care for Max due to his behavioral problems and his tendency to hurt himself. The Shattos have declined to comment publicly about the boy's death. Autopsy: The medical examiner ruled that the death of Max Shatto was an accident and an autopsy revealed he had 30 bruises on his body when he died . Accused: Kremlin accused Laura Shatto, right, of beating little Max, left, to death in January . The boy, born Maxim Kuzmin, died Jan. 21 after Laura Shatto found him unresponsive outside their home in Gardendale, Texas. A medical examiner's investigator . wrote in the report that she found abrasions, scrapes and bruises from . head to toe on Max's body. Alan Shatto told authorities that the boy hit . his head against items in the home and had serious behavioral problems. He said a doctor had prescribed the . anti-psychotic drug Risperidone, but the couple stopped giving Max the . drug after about four days after reading about the side effects and . because it appeared the boy was having trouble swallowing. Laura Shatto . reported that three days before his death, Max nearly choked on a cooked . carrot. She said he tended to bang his head . and claw himself, which she tried to prevent by cutting his nails short . and having him wear gloves at night. Tragedy: Max Shatto, 3, died in January after being adopted by a family in Texas. An Ector County grand jury has declined to indict the parents, Alan and Laura Shatto, who also adopted his half brother, Kristopher . Parents: The boy's adoptive parents denied knowing about the allegations being made by Russian authorities. No arrests have been made . Russian born: Maxim was born the town of Pskov, near Russia's western border with Estonia. The boy lived with a family in Gardendale, Texas with his family before his death . Russian authorities have blamed Max's . parents for his death and used the incident to justify a ban on all . American adoptions. Bobby Bland, the Ector County district attorney, has . said four pathologists reviewed an autopsy report and ruled Max's death . to be accidental. 'The injuries on the child were not . consistent with abuse,' Bland said this month. 'They were, instead, . consistent with the previously diagnosed behavioral disorder.' He said Max likely suffered the fatal . injuries during 10 minutes when he was playing outside and Laura Shatto . was in the bathroom. Laura Shatto told authorities that on . the day of his death, Max 'began throwing a fit' when his parents tried . to take him to the bathroom in the morning, according to the report. He . eventually went back to bed and wasn't woken up until 3 p.m., Laura . Shatto told authorities. Outrage: Demonstrators hold portraits of adopted Russian children who have died in the U.S., during a massive rally in Moscow . Protests: This woman holds a sign that reads 'Juvenile judiciary. Give us parents back!' Demonstrators walked along Moscow streets to support the new law prohibiting the adoption of Russian children by Americans . Rally: Activists from pro-Kremlin children's advocacy groups march through Moscow, demanding the return of an adopted boy whose brother, Max Shatto, died in Texas . Keeping mum: The driveway to the Shatto family home, rear left, is seen in Gardendale, Texas, with a sign that reads: 'No Comment' He and his half brother watched TV . for some time before their mother took them outside to play on the . family's swing set, the report says. Max was quiet and swaying from side . to side when Laura Shatto went inside the house to use the bathroom, . she told authorities. When she returned, she found Max on the ground . near the swings, unresponsive. The boy was pronounced dead shortly afterward at an area hospital. Russian authorities and state media . have used his death to fan opposition to American adoptions. Americans . have adopted an estimated 60,000 Russian children over the last two . decades, at least 20 of whom have died. Sad: The little boy, pictured right, was pronounced dead in hospital on Jan. 21 . The lack of charges against the . Shatto family 'raises serious questions,' Konstantin Dolgov, a Foreign . Ministry official, told a state-controlled television channel last week. 'It turns out that the child died and his adoptive parents are in no . way guilty of this. Moreover, they are trying to persuade us that the . boy's lethal injuries were inflicted by himself.' The family's attorney, Michael J. Brown, told the newspaper that while he hadn't seen the autopsy report, . he knew both Alan and Laura Shatto were doing the best they could. 'They just sort of handled it as it . came along,' Brown said, adding that 'they were not forewarned that they . had this thing they were dealing with.' Plea: In a tightly choreographed interview, Max's biological mother, 23-year-old Yulia Kuzmina, tearfully appealed to President Putin to have her surviving son returned to her . Accusations: Pavel Astakho has alleged that Maxim was beaten to death by his American mother. American authorities have not confirmed the allegations are still investigating . Look of love: Alan Shatto embraces his son, Maxim, in this photo. Max's parents wrote in his obituary, 'When we get to Heaven, we know we will hear your sweet voice singing with the angels. We love you and will always miss you' Timing: Max's death comes weeks after Russian authorities announced it was banning all adoptions by Americans .","Ector County Medical Examiner's office ruled that the death of Maxim Shatto, 3, was accidental .

Planning permission has been granted to turn the historic building into a bijou one-bedroom home, complete with the graveyard where up to 50 people are buried. The tomb with a view: This chapel in Cwmbran, South Wales, is to be turned into a one-bedroom home and is expected to fetch just £8,000 when it goes up at auction . Auctioneer Paul Fosh said: 'It will make someone a very cosy, solid little home . 'And you wouldn't have to worry about any noise from the neighbours.' . Once packed to the rafters by Welsh Non-Conformists, the chapel hasn't been used for generations, and neighbours believe it to be haunted. But to ensure the inhabitants of the graveyard are not forgotten, the tombstones will be laid flat face up so the engraved names can still be seen. They will be covered by a special transparent layer to preserve them - but the new owner's cars can drive over them.

A series of shocking confessions from alleged Apple employees across the U.S. have revealed a workplace where employees claim to smash iPads for fun, trade electronics for plastic surgery and outright steal computers as well as customers' personal information. 'We would ""field test"" things in the back,' one of several anonymous former Apple employees revealed to Gizmodo of their destructive behaviour this week. 'Most people would throw phones on the ground, slide them across the floor, and once we tried to see who could get the biggest crack.' The iPhones, iPads and other devices, all within the hundreds of dollars in shelf price, were all replaceable and without cost to the employees, according to their claims. Destroyed: An alleged former Apple store employee sent in this photograph of a smashed iPad, allegedly taken after the device was intentionally smashed for fun . This email exchange between Gizmodo and an anonymous employee details their sport of 'football' with a cracked iPhone until exchanging it for a brand new one . That's precisely what lead to their mischief they said. 'I had an extra phone lying around with a single crack, so we played football around the back of the store for a while, and when we were done, we just created what's known as a CS code for it and swapped it with a brand spanking new phone,' another wrote to the website. 'My management is so corrupt it goes beyond the retail stores,' another wrote in. Calls from MailOnline to an Apple representatives were not immediately returned. In August two former employees of a Texas store - whose astonishing recounts over the summer launched this latest national report - wrote of their corporate regional manager’s trade of computers for plastic surgery. According to the unidentified source, they would allegedly provide heavily discounted Apple computers to a local plastic surgeon so that the female employee could receive a complimentary stomach stapling procedure in return. Players: An unidentified female employee wrote in with her own scandalous confessions in the back of an Apple store while seen here sitting inside a storage box . 'She made quid pro quo an art,' that employee identified as Jake said. Behind the scenes in Apple's Genius Bar - dubbed 'the best place to get support for Apple products' according to Apple - it was an entirely other scene according to a slew of similar reports. In a popular note by the store’s alleged tech employees referred to as ‘geniuses’ by the company – much like Best Buy’s tech department is run by the so-called Geek Squad - customers' personal information was, like their products photographed smashed on the floor, not always so safe. '...The first thing we'd do is ask for a passcode and say we were going to open it in the back...' one wrote to Gizmodo. 'If you were a hot chick getting files moved, guarantee that your files were getting looked through for pictures and video. That is how we discovered one of our customers ran an adult website,' another claimed. They claim any nude or provocative photos . and/or videos would be promptly shared around the store, some allegedly . saved for ‘private use.’ No one's safe: Another employee emailed in an alleged common practice of employees stealing and passing around photos taken from customers' computers, including young girls . Not so clear: An Apple store is seen with its characteristic glass walls while inside former employees have documented a less than clear behind-the-scene behaviour . But as Gizmoto continues, alleged drug use in the stores made iToys not the only white items found in some stores. 'I can tell you that at the store I most recently worked at there was a guy who would sell drugs and be basically the main supplier for all of the store ... I knew he supplied anything from Pot, to Ecstasy and coke,' they write. That employee claimed the alleged drug . dealer was never fired despite repeatedly showing up to work while high, . or frequently not showing up at all.

A shamed police officer jailed for stealing cash during a house search was sent back to prison today for stealing two smartphones. Former PC Ian Scouler, 47, was jailed for 12 months in last November for stealing £400 left as bait during a sting operation set up to catch crooked officers. The father-of-two was released from prison last month - only to be jailed again for 30 weeks today at Westminster Magistrate’s Court after admitting two more thefts. Shamed: Former Met officer Ian Scouler, 47, was jailed for a second time today after pleading guilty to stealing two smartphones belonging to members of the public . While serving his sentence, Scouler eventually confessed to taking an iPhone and a BlackBerry. The court heard how he stole the . BlackBerry after it was handed in by a good Samaritan to the front . desk of Eltham Police Station and sold it hours later on mobile . selling site Phone Bank. Five months later the officer, who has more than 20 years service, stole an iPhone . during a house search in Woodhill, south east London. The court heard when the theft first came . to light last year, Scouler blamed his colleagues claiming one of them had given him the phone. As a result, 16 police officers involved in the house search that day had to be investigated. Emma Scheer, prosecuting at . Westminster Magistrates court, said: 'Mr Scouler was part of a search . team searching an address, various items were taken. 'It was only when the owner asked for his phone back did it emerge that Scouler had sold it through Phone Bank. 'The BlackBerry was found by a member . of the public who handed it into Eltham Police Station at 4pm. It was . submitted to Phone Bank at 1am. 'In the interview in respect of the iPhone, he said he was given it by another colleague and didn’t know it was stolen. 'He wouldn’t tell them who it was. They asked him and he said that’s loyalty, effectively, he didn’t want . to put someone up for it. 'They had to investigate all the . other police officers on the search. In respect of the BlackBerry, he . couldn’t remember where he got it from but thought it might have been at . a car boot sale. 'Both thefts were opportunistic.' Scouler's reputation was left in tatters after a jury at Southwark Crown Court found him guilty of theft. He was caught taking money in a sting operation set up following . allegations of thefts by officers from Greenwich Borough's Disruption . unit during searches. Scouler . was filmed removing the cash from a leather jacket left in a flat in . New Eltham, south east London, and putting it into his pocket. He was also taped joking 'It's not divisible by three' when a colleague found 200 Euros. Scouler and colleagues were filmed . browsing pornography and playing music while they were supposed to be . searching the flat, which had been wired with hidden recording devices. Westminster Magistrates Court heard that the former officer had previously stolen £400 and was found to have taken an iPhone . At the time Judge Michael Gledhill QC branded Scouler a 'rogue officer'. 'The trust that society places in their police officers is vitally important to everyone', he said. 'When . that trust is broken by rogue officers, as you became, public . confidence is eroded, it makes the job of honest officers far more . difficult, and it seriously undermines society.' Speaking a court today, Scouler's defence lawyer Rebecca Smith told the . court how he is suffering from depression and has had spend most . of his prison sentence in segregation because he was kept being . recognised by fellow inmates. She said: 'He has awareness and understanding of the abuse of his position and the trouble he has led his family into. 'He is the author of his own actions. He had to be moved six or seven times in prison and spent most of it in . segregation because of being recognised in custody.' Ms Smith also said the ex-PC has been offered work with lettings agency Acorn and had an interview with South West Trains. Balding Scouler stared at the ground as the 30 week sentence was handed down. District Judge Nicholas Evans said: . 'Police officers who are given power to enter a home with a search . warrant are not expected to take advantage. 'The explanation he was given the . phone by another police officer put 16 police officers under suspicion. This is a serious aggravating feature. 'Later these two acts of indecency . when you were manipulating your court appearances denied the ability of . the crown court judge to sentence you for all your offences. 'I take into account firstly the seriousness of police officers stealing when they are in a position of trust. 'Secondly, the serious aggravating . feature of putting colleagues under suspicion. Thirdly, some degree of . manipulation of the court process.'

Sean Iceton, who committed 250 burglaries before he was 17, has been jailed weeks after being released from a young offenders institution . A teenager who was jailed for breaking into more than 250 homes before he was even 17 has been convicted again for the same crime just weeks after being released from prison. Sean Iceton, 19, was jailed in 2011 after pleading guilty to a vast number of break-ins and stealing goods worth £740,000 while working as part of a 'feral' gang of young criminals. Repentant Iceton even took police officers on a tour of Leeds in West Yorkshire to point out all the properties he had targeted and what he had stolen from them. But just 12 weeks after being released from a young offenders' institution, Iceton, 19, has been convicted of breaking into more homes. Duncan Ritchie, prosecuting, told Leeds Crown Court that Iceton and another man targeted a home in Pudsey, Leeds, in February this year. They stole car keys, house keys, an iPad, iPhone and a handbag. A tracking device fitted to the iPad led officers to nearby Bramley, where Iceton was arrested. He pleaded guilty to burglary and asked for seven other offences to be taken into consideration by the court. Richard Reed, mitigating, said Iceton could not find work as a joiner after being released from prison, so returned to burglary. Judge David Hatton QC jailed Iceton for two years and four months. Speaking after the sentencing, Detective Inspector Ian Scott, of North West Leeds police, said: 'Iceton has an absolutely appalling number of crimes to his name and behind each one there is the real human misery that burglars like him cause.' Two years ago, the thief was part of an organised team which carried out the offences over a 12-month period, using profits to fund drugs and alcohol addictions. At the time he wrote a letter which stated: 'I am sorry for all the victims. I expect a prison sentence and when I get out I am going to get a job.'

Grinning smugly for the camera beside a Thai beach, Nathan McIntosh looks pretty pleased with himself. As well he might. Although he faced a curfew following his conviction for violent crime, his punishment was postponed – so he could go on this exotic holiday. Nathaniel McIntosh, 23, posted pictures such as this of him on holiday in Thailand posing with a tiger . Convicted thug Nathanial McIntosh has been boasting of his Thailand holiday after his curfew was lifted . The father sent an unrepentant taunt with a sunshine snap from the Thailand resort . The 23-year-old tattooed thug, who . carried out a ‘sustained attack’ in which he punched and kicked two men . and a woman, sparked outrage when he was given permission to go on the . already-booked four-week trip. Now in a gloating and foul-mouthed . message to his critics back home in Cornwall, the repeat offender has . posted holiday snaps of himself online, and described opponents of the . court’s decision as ‘w******’. His taunt was directed at his local . newspaper, the West Briton, after it reported on the backlash which . followed the decision to allow him the sunshine break. High life: Nathanial McIntosh was seen riding an elephant during his holiday . Relaxing: In January he was given a 12-week suspended prison sentence and an eight-week curfew, but it looked far from his mind . He posted pictures of himself lying . beside a tiger, and of bikini-clad dancing girls on stage with the . caption ‘1st night in Bangkok!’ And addressing the publication with a . photo of himself in beachwear, he wrote: ‘Put this on the front of the . West Briton....W******!!’ The newspaper did exactly that in yesterday’s edition, beneath the heading: ‘Unrepentant: Thug’s Thailand taunt.’ McIntosh in turn responded on Twitter . by calling the newspaper staff ‘c****’ and mocking them for taking the . ‘bait like a fish to a hook’, adding: ‘I am in tears over here [...] . haha.’ By yesterday afternoon, however, he had restricted his Tweets from public view. Enjoying his freedom: McIntosh, who has previous convictions for violence following an assault in 2010, posted pictures of himself at pole dancing shows and boxing matches while on holiday . McIntosh has been bragging to his followers of his holiday, and posted pictures of himself at a Full Moon Party . The roofer and amateur footballer . from Falmouth had admitted using threatening, abusive or insulting words . or behaviour with intent in an incident in Newquay last August. In January he was given a 12-week suspended prison sentence and an eight-week curfew. But a magistrate later agreed to lift the curfew so McIntosh could go on the extended break to the Phi Phi Islands. While enjoying his holiday, McIntosh, . who is banned from the road for driving while three times the legal . limit, and whose previous offences include a conviction for assault in . 2010, also boasted about watching Thai boxing fights and eating . McDonald’s. He will be subjected to the 7pm to 6am daily curfew when he returns next week. McIntosh, who had a previous conviction for assault in 2010, asked magistrates for an amendment as he had already paid for the holiday to Thailand - and they agreed . McIntosh was also given a 12 week suspended jail term for the incident in Newquay against three people, suspended for a year . McIntosh took the opportunity to crow about his holiday, after magistrates allowed him to go on holiday . The convicted thug had his curfew altered so he could go on holiday to Thailand . West Briton reader Adam Petrauske, . who spotted McIntosh’s picture on the Instagram website, said: ‘I find . it absolutely disgusting how he has been able to get away with this.’ Peter Chapman, chairman of the . Magistrates’ Association’s  sentencing committee, said: ‘If the curfew . clashes with work, a  pre-booked holiday, a relative’s wedding, or a job . interview, magistrates can adjust the curfew as they see fit. ‘The punishment imposed by a curfew . consists of the number of days and hours on which the offender’s liberty . is restricted by having to be at home.’ He added: ‘If the magistrates wish the offender to suffer a financial loss, they will order a fine to be paid. ‘They will not add to the punishment by forcing the offender to suffer additional financial losses.’ A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: . ‘Only courts can vary the requirements imposed under suspended sentence . – this is solely a matter for them.’ David Davies, Tory MP for Monmouth, . said: ‘It is absolutely horrifying that an offender such as this who has . harmed others can be allowed to go on holiday instead of carrying out . his punishment. ‘But sadly this is an all too common story of an offender not having their sentence properly enforced.’ Magistrates relaxed the thug's curfew so that he could go on holiday, where he has boasted of watching boxing matches and partying .","Nathanial McIntosh convicted of a 'sustained attack' on three people .

MPs and staff have spent £12,991 out of their own pockets on the chocolate and orange treats in the past five years at outlets and shops in the House. The total spend on 56 types of biscuits over the same period came to £112,698. Sweet choice: The Jaffa Cake is the most popular biscuit eaten by MPs in the House of Commons . However, the House of Commons said it could not produce figures to show how much is spent on biscuits handed out for free to staff and MPs during meetings. McVitie's, which produces more than 1.1billion Jaffa Cakes a year at its factory in Stockport, won a VAT tribunal in 1991 for the treats to be listed as cakes rather than biscuits so VAT is not paid on them. 1. Jaffa Cakes - £12,991 . 2. Crawford's Mini Packs (bourbon creams, digestives, custard creams, rich shorties, ginger nuts, fruit shortcake) - £16,829 . 3. Paterson's Biscuits (individual snack packs of golden crunch, choc-chip cookie, fruit, shortcake, Viennese fingers) - £12,907 . 4. Oreo biscuits (six in packet) - £6,714 . 5. Biscuit Luxury Selection (chocolate, shortbread, cherry petticoat tails, choc chip, butterscotch, crofters crumbles) - £6,304 . 6. Cranberry white chocolate cookie - £5,674 . 7. Biscuit Continental Selection (12 Varieties, seven coated with plain, . milk or white chocolate - including dipped lady fingers, Viennese butter . fingers, mini waffle style) - £4,538 . 8. Paterson's Biscuit Box (golden crunch, choc chip cookie, fruit, shortcake, Viennese fingers, double choc cookie) - £4,414 . 9. Oat fruit cookies - £4,312 . 10. Toffee chocolate pecan cookie - £4,167 . VAT is payable on chocolate-covered biscuits, which are classed as luxuries, but not on chocolate-covered cakes which are deemed a 'staple food'. A key fact at the tribunal was that Jaffa Cakes go hard when stale, whereas biscuits go soggy. Despite the request specifying 'expenditure on biscuits', House of Commons chiefs decided to include Jaffa Cakes in the list. Food and drink in the House of Commons is bought at a subsidised price. In second place on the list are Crawford's Mini Packs, which include bourbon creams, custard creams, digestives, shortbread, ginger nuts and fruit shortcake. House of Commons workers spent a total of £16,829 on the Crawford's mini-packs, but because they contain six different biscuits a favourite one could not be established - making Jaffa Cakes the most popular. A spokesman for the House of Commons said that biscuits doled out free to MPs and staff during meetings were part of the 'general refreshments costs' which it said 'could not be broken down'. He said: 'The House of Commons procures biscuits for two purposes. 'Firstly biscuits are purchased for resale within catering and retail outlets in the House. 'Secondly they can be purchased as part of a refreshments budget for meetings. 'In respect of biscuits purchased for meetings the information you require is not held by the House of Commons.

Bagged salads have been linked to a food poisoning outbreak that could have infected as many as 3,000 people, it has been revealed today. Details of the contamination, which was caused by the water born parasite Cryptosporidium, were released by the Health Protection Agency (HPA). The outbreak happened in May last year, however the details of the investigation and the likely source have only been released now. Spinach sold by Asda have been linked to the Cryptosporidium outbreak by the Health Protection Agency . The Health Protection Agency have also linked bags of mixed salad, similar to the one pictured right, sold in some Morrisons stores to the outbreak but the supermarket have strenuously denied the claims . Significantly, the contamination appears to have occurred in bags of washed mixed salad, which were marked as ready to eat. The HPA said its investigation suggested a statistically significant link to bags of mixed salad leaves sold by the Morrisons chain in Yorkshire and the Humber, the North East, the Midlands and Scotland. There was also some evidence pointing towards salad spinach leaves sold by Asda. However, the HPA said all the supermarkets tend to get their salad leaves from the same suppliers and other retailers may well have been implicated. The investigation concentrated on interviewing people who fell ill and looking for common eating patterns. No contaminated bags of salad, which have a short shelf life, were found. Some 300 people, mainly women aged over 20, reported falling ill with stomach upsets and diarrhoea to their GPs. However, the HPA believes the total number of cases is likely to be ten times higher, with most people simply putting up with the symptoms. Cryptosporidium is most often found in water contaminated with animal faeces, such as sheep dung. The HPA’s Dr Stephen Morton, who led the investigation, which also involved the Food Standards Agency (FSA), said: ‘Our findings suggest that eating mixed leaf bagged salad was the most likely cause of illness. ‘It is however often difficult to identify the source of short lived outbreaks of this type as by the time that the outbreak can be investigated, the affected food and much of the microbiological evidence may no longer be available. The HPA said that 300 people, mainly women aged over 20, reported falling ill with stomach upsets and diarrhoea . ‘As this was an isolated and short lived outbreak there is no specific action for the public to take but we hope the investigations between the FSA and the food industry will help to prevent further outbreaks of this type from happening again.’ Director of food safety at the FSA, Dr Alison Gleadle, said she believed this was an isolated incident and that, generally, consumers can trust labels which describe salads and other products as ready to eat. ‘We’d like to remind everyone of our . usual advice to wash all fruits and vegetables, including salad, before . you eat them, unless they are labelled ""ready-to-eat"",’ she said. ‘It’s . also important to wash hands thoroughly as well as clean chopping . boards, knives and other utensils between preparing raw and ready-to-eat . foods to prevent cross contamination.’ Morrisons . denied any involvement in the Cryptosporidium outbreak. It said the . HPA’s investigation had come to the wrong conclusion. It . said: ‘Morrisons is not the source of this outbreak. We have received . no complaints of illness and no Morrisons products have tested positive . for Cryptosporidia. ‘Morrisons . shares the same supply chain used for its bagged salads with several . other retailers, meaning they would also have been affected by this . outbreak. ‘The HPA appears to be concerned with making an eye catching announcement before being disbanded in two weeks’ time.‘ . Asda also denied any involvement in the food poisoning, saying: ‘The HPA research is statistically flawed and does not prove that Asda is the source of the outbreak. ‘Product safety is our top priority and if we had any serious concerns we'd act immediately. So far this hasn't been necessary.’","Health Protection Agency said outbreak was caused by water born parasite .

The world's biggest hamburger chain says the new sandwich wrap will come in three varieties of Chicken & Bacon, Sweet Chili Chicken and Chicken & Ranch while aiming to appeal to healthier, ingredient-conscious diners. The Oak Brook, Ill.-based chain says the McWraps, already similarly found in other parts of the world, use the same type of flour tortillas and chicken as its snack wraps, which were introduced in 2006. Here to stay: McDonald's is adding chicken McWrap sandwich wraps that come in three varieties to their permanent food menu, one pictured . But two of the new McWraps will come with . cucumbers, which the company says will mark the first time the . vegetable will be part of its core menu. The wraps range from 360 to 600 calories, depending on whether people pick grilled or deep-fried chicken. McDonald's Corp. has been stepping up the pace of its new menu offerings as it struggles to grow sales in the challenging economy. Last year, the company ousted the head of its U.S. division after a monthly sales figure fell for the first time in nearly a decade. By refreshing its menu, McDonald's is hoping to hold onto customers as it faces a shifting industry and intensifying competition from the likes of Burger King and Wendy's. Next week, for instance, The Wendy's Co. plans to roll out its 'Flatbread Grilled Chicken Sandwiches' in two varieties; an Asiago Ranch flavor will have 530 calories and the Honey Mustard flavor will have 370 calories. Selection: The wraps range from 360 to 600 calories, depending on whether people pick grilled or deep-fried chicken, and have a suggested price of $3.99 . The latest offerings also reflect the changing tastes of diners, who are increasingly looking for more premium ingredients with a healthier image - even at fast-food chains. McDonald's, for example, is officially calling the new wraps 'Premium McWraps.' It also plans to offer a version of its Egg McMuffin made with egg whites starting April 22. And this week, Burger King Worldwide Inc. rolled out its first turkey burger following the success of turkey burgers at Carl's Jr. and Hardee's. Dan Coudreaut, director of culinary innovation of McDonald's, says the wraps will be a new 'platform' and that different varieties are already in the pipeline. These could include spicy or Cajun flavors, he said. In Europe, he noted, there is a shrimp McWrap. 'It's the benefit of McDonald's being a global system,' he said, noting that the company can take successful items from around the world and adapt them to other markets. The Sweet Chili Chicken McWrap, for instance, was first offered in Australia. Although the chicken McWraps officially launch nationwide next week, the company says many restaurants already have them. The suggested price for a wrap is $3.99. National advertising is set to start April 1.","Available in three varieties: Chicken & Bacon, Sweet Chili Chicken and Chicken & Ranch .

A naked, malnourished four-year-old boy found inside an apartment in New Jersey with the body of his dead mother had resorted to eating from a bag of sugar, police said Wednesday. The toddler’s first request after being examined, police said, was a grilled cheese sandwich and a juice. His mother, identified as Kiana Workman, 38, from Brooklyn, was discovered dead Tuesday on the floor of her bedroom after maintenance workers at the apartment complex in northern New Jersey reported a foul odor. Heartbreaking outcome: The decomposing body of 38-year-old Kiana Workman is being wheeled out of an apartment in Union, New Jersey, where she had remained for four days with her young son . Because the chain lock was on, police said, her son couldn't get out. Officer Joseph Sauer said the boy was . naked but coherent and not crying when he kicked in the door and his . partner lifted the youngster up by the arms and pulled him out of the . overheated apartment. ‘The only way to describe the little . boy was it was like a scene from World War II, from a concentration . camp, he was that skinny. I mean, you could see all his bones,’ Sauer . told The Associated Press. The apartment in this city 15 miles . west of New York belongs to Workman's 64-year-old mother, who is . recuperating from a double hip replacement at a nursing center, said . police, who could not track down any other relatives. The boy, now in state custody, was taken to a hospital where he was treated for . malnourishment and dehydration, police said. ‘Physically, he's fine. Whether there . are any mental problems later on ... I'm not a child expert,’ Police . Director Daniel Zieser said. The boy was not strong enough to open the refrigerator and was unable to open a can of soup. 'He made a statement to the officer . that 'There's plenty of food in the refrigerator, but I couldn't open . the door,' Zieser told ABC News. Investigation: Police are looking into what killed the woman at this apartment in Union, New Jersey. Her body was found alongside her 4-year-old son, who was still alive despite not eating for five days . Mystery: Police have not identified the woman who was found here on Tuesday. She was said to be in her 20s and officers said they did not suspect foul play . 'So that's kind of sad that nobody checked on him, no family members. It's sad, very sad.' Police said he told them he had been eating from a bag of sugar. The boy could not say how long his . mother had been dead. Zieser said that Workman had ‘underlying health . issues,’ but declined to elaborate. Police said he put lotion on his . mother, leaving behind handprints, in an attempt to make her feel . better. Her decomposing body was discovered lying on a bad. Officer Sylvia Dimenna, who traveled . in the ambulance with the boy and stayed with him at the hospital, said . he was very bright and articulate but tired. Besides grilled cheese sandwiches, the little boy also said that he likes hot chocolate with marshmallows melting in the cup, NJ.com reported. ‘He said he missed his mommy,’ Dimenna said, adding that he was very quiet while watching Mickey Mouse . cartoons at the hospital. Police initially estimated she had . been dead five days before the discovery was made, but Zieser said . Wednesday it may have been two to three. Nobody had talked to her for . about a week. The boy weighed 26lbs, but at the age of four-and-a-half should have weighed at least 40lbs, Zieser said. ‘It's possible he was improperly cared for before the mother's death; we just don't know yet,’ Zieser said. Recovering: The 4-year-old is being treated in hospital and said to be suffering from starvation and dehydration after the five day ordeal . The medical examiner will perform an . autopsy Thursday to determine the cause and time of death. Police said . they did not suspect foul play. Police said they were getting calls from around the world from people offering to adopt the child or donate money or toys. ‘It's overwhelming,’ Zieser said. ‘I just hope everything works out for . the child,’ the police director said. ‘We're just going to take it one . step at a time and do the best that we can for the child.' Police said they were trying to find . someone in the family capable of taking care of the boy, including a . brother of Workman believed to live out West and other relatives, . including a 21-year-old daughter. But he said it would be up to the state's child welfare agency to determine where the child is placed. The boy was released from Overlook . Medical Center in Summit last night and was placed with a foster parent . who is a registered nurse, according to News 12 New Jersey.","Boy found inside apartment with body of his mother Kiana Workman, 38 .

Horsemeat: Leeds-based supermarket giant Asda removed the £1.54 products from stores across Britain two weeks ago on March 8 . Asda has withdrawn tens of thousands of its own brand corned beef - after it was found to contain up to 50 per cent horsemeat, it emerged today. The supermarket giant removed the £1.54 products from stores across Britain two weeks ago on March 8 - and tests this week showed quantities of horse DNA above trace levels. Leicestershire County Council found the ingredients of one batch of the 340g tins were half horse, but Leeds-based Asda has insisted it only found levels of up to five per cent. Asda, which has carried out more than 700 tests on products during the horsemeat scandal, has now had eight products that have been positive for at least traces of horse, reported The Sun. A spokesman for Asda said the chain has ‘taken a belt and braces approach’ to testing for horse DNA and quickly removed any products from its shelves ‘whenever we’ve had any concerns’. The Walmart-owned chain with 500-plus stores, whose Smart Price Corned Beef is manufactured by French supplier Toupnot, has also scraped its Chosen By You Corned Beef line, reported the Sun. The spokesman added: ‘These corned beef products are safe to eat within sell by dates, but if you have them in your cupboards you can return them to us for a full refund.’ Europe's horsemeat scandal erupted in .

For the first time ever more than half of Americans now own smartphones opposed to regular talk or text devices according to a new report. With a U.S. population of 312 million, the report by Chetan Sharma Consulting finds smartphones now amassing over half of the country's population. Adding to the boom, this year's second quarter sales reported by Sharma found that 70 per cent of phones purchased were either iPhones or androids, with the trend expected to rise. Boom: More than half of Americans now own some kind of smartphone with androids overtaking Apple's iPhone (pictured) in sales in this last sales quarter . The mobile consulting firm supports an earlier finding by Nelsen this year that used polling data to find the number of smartphone users passing the 50 per cent mark. Chetan Sharma compiled their figures using quarterly reports by the phone providers - the top four being Verizon Wireless, Sprint Nextel Corp, T-Mobile USA, AT&T. Among the most popular smartphones in terms of sales between Apple's iPhone and the Android, the latter was found dominating in the last quarter. Despite Apple racking in the highest device revenue and device profits, their iPhone sales dropped below Android's as U.S. consumers are believed to be waiting for the release of the iPhone 5 - now rumoured to be in early September. Options: Smaller carriers of smartphones outside the U.S.' top four of Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile and AT&T have also managed to tap into the market boom, like Cricket (pictured) Other smaller carriers are said to be tapping into the smartphone boom as well, however, with Gigaom reporting regional operators like MetroPCS, Cricket Communications and U.S. Cellular pulling forward with the help of cheaper phones. That price trend could prove a lesson with the example of China whose China Mobile currently leads in global profit shares thanks in part analysis say to its lesser known local firms offering cheaper phones. No surprise for China, in March it became the first nation to sign its billionth mobile subscription. India, celebrating their own boom in February, stamped out its 900th million subscription, according to Sharma, approximately one year after clocking 20 million subscriptions per month at a historical rate. Champion: Competing on the global scale, China Mobile is the reigning leader in global profit shares, just before the U.S.' top four, with the company seeing its billionth mobile subscriber in March . Apple, having a rougher capture of Chinese subscribers, offers their iPhone at a price around $800 that's the equivalent to about two months pay for an urban Chinese, according to Reuters. Those individuals are said to make up half of China's 1.3 billion population. Industry researcher IDC estimates that in China last year, smartphones costing less than $200 made up 40 per cent of shipments, while devices costing $700 and more accounted for 11 per cent of the market. 'The sweet spot of affordability in China is $130-$240,' said Michael Clendenin, managing director of Shanghai-based consultancy RedTech Advisors. 'The 'Lao Bai Xing,' or man on the street, is going to go for these mid-tier phones.' Price appeal: China's appeal to its consumers is credited to its variety of smartphones to choose from with a range of prices . Back in the U.S. there has also been a decline in contract costumers with a net of 405,000 added to the four major carriers - less than half collected the same quarter one year ago. Among providers, AT&T has sold the most iPhones making up roughly 47 per cent of the iPhones in the U.S. T-Mobile, who's currently without the iPhone, is believed to be shaping up to carry it in the near future, according to the report. The next U.S. Wireless Data Market update is expected in November while the next global update is expected in October.

It was the starting point for tens of thousands of men risking their lives on what Winston Churchill called the 'worst journey in the world'. Loch Ewe, the isolated inlet in the northwest Highlands of Scotland, was where the Arctic Convoys departed for their perilous missions to Russia during the Second World War. Now 40 of the dwindling band of heroes who braved sub-zero temperatures, terrifying seas and a gauntlet of German warplanes and U-boats are returning. Heroes: Forty of the men who braved the sub-zero temperatures during the Second World War will return to Loch Ewe, in the northwest Highlands of Scotland . The proud veterans will gather on the shores of the loch to remember their fallen colleagues, 3,000 of whom perished in the freezing waters, at a special ceremony in May. Dignitaries will present 36 former seamen with the Arctic Star - the new medal struck after a campaign by the Daily Mail to recognise their extraordinary sacrifice. Four have already received it. The day will include a memorial service led by Right Reverend Mark Strange, the Bishop of Moray, Ross and Caithness, at the Arctic Convoy Memorial high above the mouth of Loch Ewe. Honoured: The very first Arctic Star was awarded to Commander Eddie Grenfell who has battled tirelessly for 16 years for the convoy heroes to be recognised . Francis Russell, chairman of the . Russian Arctic Convoy Museum Project, which has organised the event, . said: ‘We are honouring all the convoy veterans and this will be unique . for us all – for the veterans to receive their medals officially and for . all of us to witness such a well-deserved, long awaited and memorable . occasion. 'It is of special . significance that this is happening on the shores of Loch Ewe, where . many of the veterans began their journeys to Russia.' Forty survivors of the convoys - now in their 80s and 90s - were honoured with the Arctic Star medals at a ceremony in Downing Street earlier this month. They had waited for seven decades to be honoured. Prime Minister David Cameron admitted that he was 'righting a wrong'. Winston Churchill said the journey from Loch Ewe to Russia during the Second World Wat was the 'worst journey in the world' The very first Arctic Star was awarded to Commander Eddie Grenfell, 93, who has battled tirelessly for 16 years for the convoy heroes to be recognised. Cdr Grenfell survived ten minutes in the icy Arctic waters before he was rescued after his ship SS Empire Lawrence was bombed in May 1942. More than 3,000 Royal Navy and merchant seaman died between 1941 and 1945 on the convoys. Only about 200 veterans are still alive. The convoys carried four million tons of cargo including tanks, planes, fuel and food to slow Germany's advances on the Eastern front. Many vessel massed in Loch Ewe before embarking on the treacherous journey past Norway and through the Barents Sea to Murmansk and Archangel. More than 66,000 Royal Navy sailors and merchant seamen took part. In total, 87 merchant ships and 18 British warships were sunk. But the Cold War meant it was politically difficult to give the survivors a medal for assisting the Soviet Union and it only now that the Arctic Convoy veterans have been properly recognised. Mr Cameron ordered the medals amid concerns many veterans would die before they were awarded. Campaigners will use the occasion to launch a £2.5milion fundraising drive during WWII Week to build a museum and new community centre on the site of HMS Helicon, the Arctic Convoys base from 1941-1945. The veterans will have chance to see the plans for the new development and to hear how their stories of bravery, loss and suffering will be recorded for future generations.","The Arctic Convoys departed for their missions from Loch Ewe in Scotland to Russia during the Second World War .

Sitting in the make-up bus on his first day back at work as Jonathan Creek, Alan Davies glanced around and saw an extremely ugly looking object. ‘It was a polystyrene head with dark grey hair wefts on it,’ he recalls. ‘I didn’t remember there being a tramp character in the script and I wondered what saddo was going to have to put those in his hair.’ Turns out it was him. For while Alan and his television alter ego may have once had gorgeous ‘nut brown golden’ hair, as he describes it, now it is a different matter. Both of them are in their late 40s and, if you were being kind, you might describe the colour of their hair as platinum. Anyway, it did not take much more than a few grey strands to turn Jonathan Creek’s hair back to its bouncy best, and once Alan put on the detective’s famous duffle coat (which he had stored in a cupboard at home) he was straight back into the character he last played three years ago. Now the super sleuth, a magic tricks creator who specialises in solving seemingly supernatural deaths with a comedy twist, is back not only for a special edition this Easter (this will be its third special since the show ended in 2003), but also a short series that will start filming later this year. Alan, whose main profile since the show ended has been as a permanent panellist on comedy quiz QI, says he could not be happier. ‘Jonathan hadn’t been killed off, so there was always a chance the show could come back,’ he says. ‘But the writer David Renwick stopped it when it was in its prime because he had run out of ideas for mysteries, so a new series really came out of the blue. Sidekick: Alan Davies as Jonathan Creek and Sheridan Smith as Joey Ross in the new series . ‘I was really pleased. In the old days I used to worry about whether I should be doing  the show. ‘Was it wise? Would it be good for me in the long run? What other roles could I get? But since then I’ve discovered it doesn’t really work like that. ‘You can’t really plan your career in this business. It tends to go around in cycles. You can be in demand or off the map and it’s not really in your control, so you just have to enjoy it and be grateful when things come your way.’ The 47-year-old Essex-born father of two, who started out as a stand-up comedian, admits he is still bitterly disappointed that his comedy Whites, in which he starred as a chef, was canned after one series in 2010 despite getting good reviews and ratings. At the time he took to Twitter to vent his fury at the ‘shoddy’ way the BBC had axed the show. Today, even though the BBC has brought back Jonathan Creek and screens QI, and is therefore his principal employer, Alan still doesn’t mince his words. He’s never been the type to — even though he has had to apologise to Tory peer Lord McAlpine for an untrue allegation he tweeted to his 440,000 followers and, it emerged this week, may still be forced to pay £200,000 to make amends. This time, he just lowers his voice a little to me in a conspiratorial whisper so that the BBC apparatchiks who have organised the interview don’t hear. ‘It’s impossible to fathom what the thought process is,’ he says of the BBC. ‘The people who commission shows quite often haven’t produced shows or written shows or made shows in the past. All star cast: Sheridan Smith and Alan Davies alongside Rik Mayall and Joanna Lumley . ‘It used to be that people came from the business. Now they have careers in television; they go from being a PA to an assistant to being in charge. ‘They don’t even talk to you; it’s impossible to get a meeting with them. So that means it’s impossible to know what they want. ‘They brought Shooting Stars back. It was hilarious and won a comedy award and then they canned it. ‘After The Office they only wanted non-audience shows, but now Miranda and Mrs Brown’s Boys are popular they want more of that. They don’t seem to understand that it doesn’t really work like that. ‘The people in charge are not people with an eye for comedy writing or experience in comedy writing. ‘I was really baffled when they ended Whites. They said: “We love all of  you in the show and now we are firing you.” ‘When I told David Renwick, he said: “Welcome to my world. It’s like Kafka. You don’t know who is in charge or what is going on.” ’ He believes that Jonathan Creek was mainly brought back because of its continuing popularity around the world. At the moment Alan is getting lots of emails from Russia. ‘It sells all over the world and the DVD sales are so huge it’s a no-brainer when money is tight,’ he says. But that is not to say the BBC will be splashing the cash with the new production. ‘People always ask about the windmill that Jonathan lives in, but the truth is we haven’t shot in a windmill for years,’ he says. ‘It’s too expensive. We can’t even afford to use a TV studio. Fresh faced: Alan Davies in the fourth series of Jonathan Creek . in 2003 . ‘I don’t even know what TV studios are used for now; if they are too expensive for us, who is using them? ‘Now we shoot on an industrial estate in Esher. It’s not a studio, it’s not soundproofed and it’s freezing. ‘The way David gets around it in the script is by using a disused school, which is derelict. That means you don’t have to dress the set up; you just have to find a derelict building. ‘When I sit down and watch Downton Abbey I think that they must have spent more on their tea sets than we spent on our entire budget. The budget has been hacked to bits and everyone is on the same money we were on in the mid-Nineties. ‘It’s not that we don’t get paid; we get well paid and we like it. But it’s a strange time in television. They have got a lot of buildings now, but they should try making some programmes.’ Money may have been tight; but the cast list is still impressive. For the Easter special Alan is joined by Joanna Lumley, as a woman who sees her husband’s dead body in a room before it vanishes; Nigel Planer (the vanishing corpse); Rik Mayall, who reprises his role as DI Gideon Pryke; and the ubiquitous Sheridan Smith, who returns as Alan’s sidekick. Sheridan took over from Julia Sawalha, whom Alan dated for several years after meeting on the show. He is now happily married to writer Katie Maskell and they have two young children. ‘Everything changes when you have a family,’ he sighs. ‘I am quite happy now just to go on tour and spend three days a week working and then being  able to come home and be with my family.’ The storyline in the new Jonathan Creek is as maze-like as ever. Alan admits he has long given up trying to work out what the ending will be. ‘The idea of trying to work it out as you go along is a pointless exercise,’ he says. ‘I’ve learned that through the years; I never work out the ending until the end.’ Old flames: Alan Davies dated his former co-star Julia Sawalha, who played sidekick Carla Borrego . He believes, though, that a 1998 episode, The Problem At Gallows Gate, in which a man jumps off a roof to fake suicide, inspired the makers of BBC1’s Sherlock  series last year. In the final episode, Sherlock Holmes, played by Benedict  Cumberbatch, was seen jumping from a hospital roof, and then sprawled apparently lifeless on  the ground. Yet a few scenes  later viewers see he is alive, because he has used trickery to foil his enemies. Davies says Sherlock used the same idea as Creek’s producers.  ‘He landed on a removable panel covering a safety net stretched across a trench dug in the ground,’ he explains. He insists that, despite cost cuts, he is certain the viewers will still enjoy the new Creek series.  ‘The good thing about David [who also wrote One Foot In The Grave, Hot Metal and Love Soup] is that he will never let standards drop,’ says Alan. ‘You can still make great stuff without loads of money. ‘I would love it to appeal to a new audience. I get emails from younger people who watch me on QI and then discover me on Jonathan Creek and write saying, “You’re a legend.” ‘I like that.’","Alan Davies is returning as Jonathan Creek with a glamorous new sidekick .

A cash-strapped council has angered residents by spending £1,000 of public money on a spoof Frank Sinatra music video about potholes. The video was intended to promote Worcestershire County Council's highways department and its work. However, with road damage in Worcestershire at record levels, locals were left wondering why the council was taking time out to make a parody of Sinatra's classic 'My Way'. Scroll down for video . Sinatra parody: Worcestershire Highways Manager Jon Fraser donned a dinner jacket to recreate some Rat Pack magic . Raising awareness: Worcestershire Council argued that it was an efficient way to get their pothole awareness message attention . In the four-minute clip, which took 36 hours to edit, Highways Manager Jon Fraser takes a starring role as Old Blue Eyes wearing a dinner jacket while he croons along country roads and an office. The lyrics to  'Right Here in Highways' include the seemingly inappropriate line: 'At work, our days our full'. Fraser gives David Brent a run for his money, singing lines like 'Complaints, we get a few/But those we do, we're glad you mention.' He goes on: 'We'll fill the holes, without exemption/We'll lay, each tarmac course/Not when it's wet, but on a dry day' Hard work: The comedy cover took almost £1,000 and 36 hours to edit . Hoping for a hit: Jon Fraser, Worcestershire Highways Manager, said that he hoped it would be as popular as Torfaen Council's 'In The Depot' Some £113million was spent last year filling in the pot-holes but the spending is barely keeping pace with the maintenance backlog across England and Wales. Worcestershire Council had hoped to emulate the popularity of Wales' Torfaen Council which a viral hit with an Elvis-inspired ode to its gritters called 'In The Depot'. Fraser explained: 'Torfaen Council's video, which has had over 470,000 views on YouTube, is a brilliant way to raise awareness of the tough job councils do to support residents and businesses through maintaining the roads throughout Winter.' Fraser said he was 'inspired' by 'In The Depot' and he hoped that his video 'broadcasts a serious and important message about the value of reporting potholes in an enjoyable way'. However the council, which is looking to slash £100m from its budget, was criticised by residents and campaigners for wasting public money. 'Drivel': Worcestershire residents complained on YouTube when the video went up, wondering why the Council were not just fixing the potholes rather than singing about them . Robert Oxley, Campaign Manager of the . TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'Worcestershire County Council should worry . more about fixing the roads than singing about them. 'An amusing video will be zero comfort to motorists dodging potholes on the highways.' 'This idea should never have got off the drawing board and instead transport chiefs should have spent their time and taxpayers' money doing something useful.' The video drew abuse when it was uploaded to Youtube yesterday. Leon Smy wrote: 'Looks to me like far too much time and effort creating this total waste of time instead of actually doing what you promise to do. 'This is a really poor show. Far more important things for the council to spend the funding on than uploading drivel like this to Youtube.' 'Bad timing': Derek Jones from near Worcester said of the pothole crisis, 'it's almost as though the only answer they've got is to make an embarrassing video' User Rh3na added: 'So you think it's a good idea to blow council tax payers money on making a video? how much have we paid for this while Worcester services are cut.' 'What purpose does this serve apart from a back slapping exercise for people who should be working for us not exercising egos. 'Pathetic truly pathetic you should be ashamed of yourselves.' Belt-tightening: The Council was seen to be splurging money on a publicity video when taxpayers are demanding better value for money from all their services . Derek Jones, 54, of Norton, near Worcester, suffered £165 damage to his car on the county's roads last week. Mr Jones, who had a compensation claim rejected, said: 'I think it's stupid and sums up their mentality.' 'It's terribly bad timing, it's almost as though the only answer they've got is to make an embarrassing video with all those blokes in the background, it's disgusting.' It was reported last week workers . from the council are repairing a 200 potholes a day, and have . filled in almost 5,000 since the start of the year.

Doomed hero: Freeze Frame of Captain Scott writing his journal in the Winterquarters Hut . A letter written by Polar hero Captain Scott as he neared death, with a poignant plea for his family to be looked after, has been published in full for the first time. Part of the pencilled letter to a friend was already in the public domain, in which Scott wrote of his doomed team setting a ‘good example to our countrymen’ and facing their fate ‘like men’. But two lines were kept hidden by the 1912 document’s previous owner. They say: ‘I want you to secure a competence for my widow and boy. I leave them very ill provided for, but feel that the country ought not to neglect them.’ In a touching PS he ends: ‘Excuse writing, it is -40, and has been for nigh a month.’ The complete letter to Admiral Sir Francis Bridgeman, who had been Scott’s commanding officer in the Royal Navy, is unveiled today by Cambridge University’s Scott Polar Research Institute to mark the 101st anniversary of the explorer’s death. It is one of ten he wrote to friends and family when he realised he would not return home. Archivists believe most were written around the time of his final diary entry on March 29, which read: ‘For God’s sake look after our people.’ He is presumed to have died that day. SPRI archivist Naomi Boneham said: ‘The letters are written on paper ripped from diaries. It is hard to imagine how desperate it must have felt. 'It is incredibly moving.’ Captain Robert Falcon Scott, 43, and his team of Dr Edward Wilson, Captain Laurence Oates, Lieutenant Henry Bowers and Petty Officer Edgar Evans, were beaten to the South Pole by Norwegian Roald Amundsen, and died on the return journey. A fund in response to Scott’s plea on behalf of the team’s dependents raised £75,000, equivalent to more than £5.5million now. His . son Peter, who was two at the time of Scott’s death, became the leading . naturalist and artist who co-founded the World Wide Fund for Nature.

I fear we have shipped up – a close shave. I am writing a few letters which I hope will be delivered some day. I want to thank you for the friendship you gave me of late years, and to tell you how extraordinarily pleasant I found it to serve under you. I want to tell you that I was not too old for this job. It was the younger men that went under first. Finally I want you to secure a competence for my widow and boy. I leave them very ill provided for, but feel that the country ought not to neglect them. After all we are setting a good example to our countrymen, if not by getting into a tight place, by facing it like men when we were there. We could have come through had we neglected the sick.

Executives at NBC have been forced to deliver a swift and rather blunt response to the rumors they were in talks with Anderson Cooper about taking over from Matt Lauer on the Today show at the end of the year. NBC allegedly contacted the CNN anchor recently about the move and when $25million-a-year Lauer, found out, he is believed to have exploded and told them he would not support their decision. But this afternoon, NBC issued a short statement simply saying: 'We are not considering replacing Matt Lauer.' CNN anchor: NBC executives allegedly contacted Anderson Cooper recently about replacing Matt Lauer at the end of the year when his contract runs out . NBC executives have confirmed they were in touch with Cooper, but not to take over from Lauer. They said: 'The network has exploratory talks with talent inside and outside of the network. But to read anything specific into that is presumptuous.' And NBC News senior VP Alexandra Wallace . told The Hollywood Reporter in a statement: 'As we’ve said before, Matt Lauer is the best . in the business. We want him in the Today show anchor chair for many . years to come.' According to The Hollywood Reporter, sources close to Cooper say he is not interested in trading globetrotting for 4am wake up calls and he said recently that he expects new CNN chief Jeff Zucker to keep his program, Anderson Cooper 360 in its 8pm time slot. But the rumors will undoubtedly rock the Today show boat once again, which is happening more and more frequently in recent weeks. Yesterday, it was reported that Lauer is furious with the show's producers as he feels they set him up by airing an interview with the controversial filmmaker who made a disturbing documentary about Jerry Sandusky. The Today co-host believes he was put in the line of fire for getting him to anchor the interview that John Ziegler did with the convicted child rapist and former Penn State assistant football coach. According to RadarOnline.com: 'Morale just couldn’t get any lower among the cast and crew of Today. Matt feels that he was set up by producers to fail by participating in the interview with Ziegler. Move: Today show host Matt Lauer was on the brink of moving to rival network ABC last year, it has been claimed . 'Matt didn’t think it was a good idea . to air it to begin with. Jerry Sandusky is a convicted child rapist, . and Matt’s feeling was, let’s talk to the victims, and not him. 'However, he wanted to prove he was a . team player and did it. Producers thought it would generate a lot of . publicity, but no had any idea it would have garnered so much . controversy.' It was first believed that Lauer . would go to Greene State Correctional Institute in Waynesburg, Centre County, and interview Sandusky himself, but when the . segment was aired on Monday it became clear it was a preview of The . Framing of Joe Paterno. In the documentary, Ziegler calls the . legal case against Sandusky 'remarkably weak' and claims the sexual . assault Mike McQueary said he saw was actually a 'botched grooming'. He does however, agree that Sandusky was guilty of 'many, if not all, of the things he was convicted of'. Lauer is said to be suspicious of the timing of the interview and wonders if the network is setting him up to fail. It comes just after the news anchor . did an interview with New York Magazine about the behind-the-scenes . turmoil surrounding Ann Curry's public ousting. The source told Radar: 'Matt is trying . to do everything he can to save the sinking ship, but he just doesn’t . know who he can trust anymore.' Ratings slide: Matt Lauer, seen left with co-anchor Savannah Guthrie, is said to have changed his mind and stay at NBC - his home of almost 20 years .

The . claims emerge amid reports the 55-year-old journalist's $25million NBC . contract will not be renewed when it expires next year, after the fiasco . surrounding the dismissal of former co-anchor Ann Curry saw his . popularity with viewers take a nosedive. ABC chiefs including Bob Iger, CEO of . parent company Disney, and Ben Sherwood, ABC News boss, all thought the . move was confirmed, as did Lauer's agent, according to a report in the New York Post. The . NBC stalwart would have become an ABC News personality, co-hosted the . Katie Couric talk show, and taken an occasional role on Good Morning . America, said the report, which cited New York magazine. But . the journalist changed his mind and decided to stay at NBC, a decision . which is said to have left Mr Iger and others 'infuriated'. The Today show was thrown into turmoil after co-anchor Ann Curry was sacked from her post, and Mr Lauer was not seen to fight for his colleague. The handling of Ms Curry's dismissal prompted a backlash from viewers of the show, which is now in second place behind Good Morning America in the ratings.

An alleged blackmailer who tried to extort $5,000 from a university professor with an online sex scam involving his underage daughter pleaded not guilty on Tuesday. The 37-year-old, from . Louisiana, was arraigned in Houston federal court on a charge of using a phone and the Internet . to extort money from Texas A&M University professor James Arnt Aune, . 59. Mr Aune, a married father-of-two autistic children, jumped to his . death from a campus parking garage on January 8. He had been lured into sharing . sexually explicit pictures with an underage girl online and then . blackmailed by her father who orchestrated the elaborate scam, . police said. Scam: Texas A&M University professor James Arnt Aune, 59, (left) committed suicide following a blackmail plot allegedly carried out by a 37-year-old man (right) from Louisiana using his own daughter . The suspect was ordered to remain in jail without bail and his trial is scheduled for May 28. If convicted, he faces up to two . years in jail. His court-appointed attorney Marjorie Meyers declined . to comment about the case. Authorities allege that Aune was one of . many victims of a scheme in which the man used his daughter to lure men . into sexually explicit online relationships and later blackmailed them. The man has not been named to protect the identity of his daughter. Prosecutors allege that the man's daughter told authorities in . Louisiana in 2011 that her father took naked photos and videos of her . and used them 'to scam men' through MocoSpace, a social networking . website mainly for mobile devices. On . the site, 'she would meet men, get their phone numbers and send them . pictures and videos then (her father) would call them and say how she . was his daughter and how she would need counseling and they had to pay . for it'. At the time of . that 2011 interview, her father was facing two counts of oral sexual . battery and two counts of aggravated incest. Blackmail: Aune, pictured center, sent his alleged blackmailer a text message stating 'Killing myself now. And u will be prosecuted for blackmail' one minute before he jumped to his death . The charges were dropped in . February 2012 due to a lack of corroborating evidence, said Rachael . Domiano, a spokeswoman for the 21st Judicial District Attorney's Office . in Louisiana. Federal . prosecutors on Tuesday declined to comment about certain details of the . alleged scheme, and it wasn't clear from the criminal complaint if . prosecutors believe the defendant's daughter actually interacted with . Aune, or if her image was used to allegedly dupe him. Mr Aune was regarded as a fine scholar, mentor and friend by students and fellow professors, where he headed the school's Department of Communication. However he had battled depression in recent years. He struggled with the administrative duties of being a department head, and he was badly shaken by his 2007 battle with prostate cancer, which he survived but which forced him to face his own mortality, his widow said. 'He never really came all the way back,' Miriam Aune said of his surviving cancer. He began drinking heavily, and in December he started a sexually explicit online relationship with what he thought was an underage girl, according to prosecutors. He was soon contacted by a man purporting to be her outraged father, who threatened to expose Aune unless he paid him $5,000. Elaborate scam: The 37-year-old suspect appeared at federal court in Houston on Tuesday and was ordered to remain in jail until his trial on May 28 . Aune paid the man $1,500, but he didn't know if he could come up with the rest, authorities say. He confessed to his wife, who pledged to stand by him, but about a week later, the 59-year-old Aune jumped to his death after sending a final text: 'Killing myself now. And u will be prosecuted for black mail.' Mrs Aune, 56, said investigators told her that the defendant was the person who communicated with her husband and other men, pretending to be his daughter. She said her husband told her he began the online chats sometime in December and that by the third or fourth day after the chats began, the defendant reached out to him asking for money. According to court records, undated texts show Aune scrambling to put money on prepaid credit cards for the defendant and asking for his forgiveness, saying: 'I am very sorry. It was a weak moment.' A week before his suicide, James Aune confessed to his wife. Miriam Aune said her husband never told her why he did it. She pledged her support for him, but said he became despondent after his confession. 'I was just telling him there was nothing that we couldn't get through. We have two autistic children we have raised to adulthood. We've been through rough stuff. I thought we could get through this,' Miriam Aune said. Sad: Aune, pictured, a married father of two who was also chair of the school's Department of Communications, committed suicide on the morning of January 8 . According to a criminal complaint, . the defendant continued bombarding Aune with profanity laced emails, . texts and voicemails, including a January 7 email in which he warned . Aune that he had until noon the next day to pay or else 'the police, . your place of employment, students, ALL OVER THE INTERNET ...ALL OF THEM . will be able to see your conversations, texts, pictures you sent ....' On . January 8 at 9.21am, the defendant texted: '3 more hours. If i don't . hear from you the calls start,' according the criminal complaint by FBI . agent Nikki Allen. At 10.29 am, Aune replied: 'Killing myself now And u will be prosecuted for blackmail.' He . jumped from the parking garage roof about a minute later, shocking the . A&M campus, which is about 100 miles northwest of Houston. Miriam Aune doesn't excuse her husband's actions. She said it was his decision to go online and begin the conversations. 'It . just shows you anybody can slip off the path. I know a lot of people . are very surprised by this. He was very human with flaws, just like all . of us,' she said.

Victim Elizabeth Smart had just dropped her kids off at school when she became involved in a foul-mouthed row with a relative of Sharon Nyberg, 43. Ms Smart was offered refuge in the school, but when she left Nyberg was waiting for her outside the school gates.

Mothers Sharon Nyberg (left) and Jolene Angus (right) have been given community orders after a brawl in a school playground in Alnwick, Northumberland .

During . the attack at St Michael's Church of England First School, in Alnwick, . another parent, Jolene Angus, 26, also joined in with the attack.

The father of a 7/7 terror attack victim whose phone was hacked by the News of the World accused Labour yesterday of being ‘steamrollered’ into shackling the Press. Graham Foulkes, whose son David, 22, was killed by a bomb at Edgware Road tube station in 2005, accused Hacked Off of hijacking the phone-hacking scandal for its own reasons and said the group is ‘not representative’ of the victims. Mr Foulkes was told by police in 2011 that his voicemails and those of his son were accessed on the day of the attack by a private investigator working for the now defunct Sunday tabloid. Hacking victims: David Foulkes, right, who was killed in the 7/7 bombings in 2005, had his voicemails hacked on the day he died but his father Graham Foulkes, left, says Hacked Off is 'not representative' of victims . He and his wife decided not to sue News International for compensation. He insists the wrongdoing was already covered by the criminal law. Mr Foulkes, from Oldham, said: ‘The fact is, phone hacking and bribery of officials is in itself a criminal offence. It is being dealt with in the criminal courts. Any law that says it’s against the law to break the law is just a nonsense.’ Labour leader Ed Miliband was ‘shameless’ in allowing Hacked Off, the celebrity campaign group fronted by Hugh Grant, to be involved in the late-night deal struck between the parties last week on Press regulation following Lord Justice Leveson’s inquiry, he said. ‘They are a pressure group. They are not representative. Hacked Off became a major force and have swamped the media with their version of events and what they think should happen. ‘Hacked Off seem to have cosied up to the Labour Party to such an extent that we can’t distinguish between them. The parties have used Leveson as a cosh to beat each other with. Terror attack: Despite having his phone hacked after the 7/7 London bombings, Mr Foulkes insists that the laws Hacked Off is pushing for are a knee-jerk reaction and 'a nonsense' ‘What concerns me greatly is that this crucial issue of freedom of the Press is being steamrollered through. It’s happening because of the political pressure rather than a desire to do the right thing.’ While he had initially welcomed the Leveson Inquiry, thinking it would help ordinary people, he said he thought the judge had ‘lost his way’ once celebrities became involved. Mr Foulkes said he had emailed Culture Secretary Maria Miller to say that Hugh Grant’s experience did not reflect that of ordinary people caught up in the scandal. He asked to meet her but was told she was not available. Political: Actor Hugh Grant from the Hacked Off campaign with Lib Dem Dr Evan Harris, right and journalist John Kampher left at last year's annual Lib Dem conference . The imprisonment of former Liberal . Democrat MP Chris Huhne and the MPs’ expenses scandal were examples of . how the Press could hold politicians to account, Mr Foulkes said. ‘I’m really concerned that Hacked Off have created a head of steam with quite a high emotional content and the parties have got suckered into this. 'It would be a dark day when politicians are allowed to interfere with the freedom of the Press.’ When he gave evidence to the inquiry last year, he expressed his fears at the Government having a ‘knee-jerk reaction’ and imposing ‘overly restrictive codes of practice on solid, important journalism’. Shameless: Labour leader Ed Miliband allowed Hacked Off, fronted by actor Hugh Grant, into the late night deal between political parties on press regulation . He said: ‘We’ve seen many examples where journalists have brought terrorists, murderers and criminals to justice where the police have failed.’ Mr Foulkes told how for six and a half days after the 7/7 attack he and his family had tried to phone his son, who would have been 30 yesterday. ‘If they [the News of the World] were listening to those phone calls that’s absolutely disgusting’, he said. ‘They broke the law, and when the law is broken there should be punishment. I don’t want to accept a cheque from News International.’ Hacked Off said most of its members were not celebrities.","Graham Foulkes' son was killed in the 7/7 bombing in 2005 .

Millions were shut out of their bank accounts today after another meltdown in the computer system at the NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland. The mobile Apps used by two million customers to access their accounts from iPhones, Android smartphones and tablets failed in the early morning. People who were waking up and checking transactions and balances, or trying to make payments, were locked out of their accounts for several hours. Royal bank of Scotland and Natwest had issues with their smartphone and tablet apps affecting millions of people . The troubled bank, which is 82per cent owned by taxpayers, has suffered a series of technical failures that have left customers frustrated and angry. The bank offered apologies and updates on its official Facebook page in an unsuccessful attempt to quell complaints and prevent people switching away. One angry customer wrote: ‘I’ve moved to Barclays after 10 years of nothing but hassle from NatWest ...... Little Britain must of got the phrase ‘computer says no’ from NatWest’. Business and personal mobile banking customers for Natwest, RBS, and . Ulster Bank are today experiencing problems . A second said: ‘So pleased I opened a new account with someone else on Tuesday. Natwest are useless.’ A third spoke for many, stating: ‘Hey Natwest, instead of giving your useless bosses at the top of Natwest tower massive bonuses, try employing IT people who actually know what they are doing.’ The RBS-Natwest group paid bonuses totalling £607 million for 2012 despite amassing losses of some £5.2billion. The mobile banking App which operates on the Android software system used by Samsung and others was restored around lunchtime yesterday. However, it took more than an hour longer to reinstate the service to customers who log in through Apple’s iPhone and iPad. Last summer, a major computer system failure that locked millions out of current accounts cost the bank some £175 million in compensation. In October, NatWest had to suspend a mobile phone banking App feature called GetCash, after the service was subject to a spate of ‘phishing’ attacks by fraudsters. The GetCash service, which allows customers to withdraw cash without using a debit card, was later re-instated after security was beefed up. Just three weeks ago a hardware fault . prevented customers from using cash machines and also affected online . and telephone banking services. The . bank has been heavily promoting the benefits of its mobile phone . banking App. It recently unveiled a feature called Pay Your Contacts, . which allows customers to send payments of up to £100 to anyone with a . Visa card, by entering their mobile number. Mobile banking users took to Twitter to ask what was happening . A spokeswoman for consumer group Which? said the problems will raise wider questions about ‘how robust and up to date banks’ IT systems are’. She said: ‘Consumers and businesses alike rely on mobile banking services to access their accounts and consumers will rightly want to be assured that their money is accessible and safe at all times.’ Laura Willoughby, of the Move your Money campaign group, said: ‘Coming just weeks after the last IT failure, this really is the last straw for customers fed up with such unhelpful banking. RBS is not only too big to fail, but too big to provide proper customer service as well.’ RBS blamed a technical problem that was restricted to the mobile Apps and apologised to customers for the inconvenience.","Mobile and tablet apps used by two million people failed today .

"By . Beth Stebner . PUBLISHED: . 00:52 EST, 28 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 00:52 EST, 28 March 2013 . Insight: Search warrants will be released at 9:01am Wednesday that could give insight into the mind of gunman Adam Lanza . No one knew what caused Adam Lanza to enter Sandy Hook Elementary School last December armed with several assault weapons, gunning down teachers and students in one of the worst school massacres the country has ever seen. But search warrant documents released today could shed some light on the 20-year-old killer’s motives and his mental state that led to the December 14 shooting that left 20 children and six educators dead. The documents will be released as an order that kept them sealed expires, making them available to the public, and will contain - among other things - a full list of the things that were recovered from Lanza's car and house. The five warrants could help answer why Lanza turned a gun on his mother, 52-year-old Nancy Lanza, at their home before driving off to the nearby elementary school with a Bushmaster .223-caliber with a 30-round magazine before turning another one of his mother’s guns on himself. As NBC News’ Open Channel reports, the sealed documents include information on the five search warrants ordered for the Lanza’s sprawling home in Sandy Hook, as well as the Honda Civic that sat in their driveway. Connecticut Superior Court Judge John F. Blawie granted a motion Wednesday to redact specific information from the affidavits, including a name of a witness, telephone numbers, and other personal identifiers. Roped off: Crime scene tape remained outside Nancy Lanza's Sandy Hook home days after the shooting; five search warrants and the corresponding documents will be released today . Aftermath: A single bouquet of flowers lies on the ground in front of a police cruiser parked in the driveway outside Nancy Lanza's home . The prosecutor's motions were approved by a Danbury Superior Court judge, clerk Geoffrey Stowell said. Gov. Dannel P. Malloy announced last week that additional information would be released at his request. The Connecticut governor expressed concern that certain information about the shooting rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School disclosed by a top state police commander at a recent law enforcement seminar in New Orleans was leaked. Killed: Nancy Lanza, 52, was her son's first victim as he began his December 14 killing spree . 'Like many others, I was disappointed and angered to learn that certain information about the Newtown shooting had been leaked, specifically with concern for the victims' families who may have been hearing this news for the first time,' the governor said in a statement. A column published last week in the New York Daily News, citing an unnamed police officer who attended the seminar, reported that Col. Daniel Stebbins discussed evidence that suggested the Newtown gunman, 20-year-old Lanza, studied other mass slayings and dedicated extensive planning to the rampage that left 20 first-graders and six educators dead. The seminar was designed for law enforcement professionals only and sensitive information dealing with the tactical approaches used by first responders to the Sandy Hook shootings was discussed, state police spokesman Lt. J. Paul Vance said. Danbury State’s Attorney Stephen Sedensky III briefed victims’ parents Wednesday night in a two-and-a-half hour meeting, according to the New Haven Register. The documents were unsealed at midnigh . t, meaning that the family of those killed would be able to see the documents before reporters are emailed at 9:01 Thursday morning. Asked by the paper how the parents responded, Mr Sedensky said it was ‘hard to say.’ Jimmy Greene, who is the father of victim Anna Marquez-Green, told the paper that he did not want to comment on the meeting. ‘It’s been a tough day.’ In memoriam: Twenty-six roses depicting the faces of the dead are attached to a phone pole at a makeshift memorial in Sandy Hook following the shootings . Additional reports have emerged that Lanza was obsessed with other mass killings, and had modeled his attack after the 2011 Norway attack of white supremacist Anders Behring Breivik, who shot and killed 77 people, mostly teenagers, in a combined bombing and shooting. In a joint investigation from PBS’ ‘Frontline’ and the Hartford Courant, reporters found that even as a child, Lanza hated to be touched. There has also been unconfirmed speculation that Lanza had been deeply influenced by violent video games. Senate President Donald E. Williams Jr. said this week that legislative leaders hope to review the search warrant documents before finishing work on a bipartisan bill that addresses gun control and other issues related to the massacre. Last week, Sen. Diane Feinstein, the sponsor of the polarizing gun control bill announced to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid that the assault weapons clause had been dropped. The senator said that she hopes to offer a ban on military-style firearms as an amendment as the bill moves to the Senate in April.","Search warrants and affidavits to be released Thursday at 9:01am .

Bodies discovered in a once-secret graveyard at a closed-down Florida reform school could be dug up after calls for federal funding for a forensic investigation into the site. Dozens of unmarked graves have been found at the Dozier School in the Florida Panhandle city of Marianna, after years of allegations of abuse and children dying in mysterious circumstances. Soon investigators could digging up that past. Scroll down for video . Horrors: Crosses mark graves at a cemetery at . Dozier School for Boys in Marianna, Florida. Investigators have said . they had found at least 50 graves on the grounds . Scene: Former students spoke out several years ago with horror stories of sexual abuse and frequent beatings in this mausoleum-like building dubbed the 'White House' Investigation: Researchers believe that 96 boys died at the school and expect to find more burial sites . Investigators are trying to determine . the circumstances surrounding the deaths, which experts say probably . occurred between 1914 and 1952. State officials have for years . insisted that 31 boys were interred in a tiny cemetery on the grounds of . the notorious reform school. But now, using high-tech search . equipment, forensic scientists have already found evidence of at least . another 19 bodies buried under the site - and fear there could be many . more. 'We really don't know exactly how . many, or who they are,' said Erin Kimmerle, a forensic anthropologist at . the University of South Florida. She has a scroll-like map of spots . around the school's grounds where her ground-piercing radar has spotted . evidence of human remains. The Dozier School was legend among . adolescents for about 100 years in Florida, as the state's major reform . school, until it was closed in 2011. Former students spoke out several . years ago with horror stories of sexual abuse and frequent beatings in a . mausoleum-like building dubbed the 'White House' where nine barren . cubicles held boys accused of rule breaking. Some died under unknown circumstances, according to relatives. Institution: Dozier was opened as a state reform school in January 1900 for misbehaving boys . Treatment: The boys were allegedly forced into hard labour, while others were beaten, raped or killed . Culture: A memorial or burial service around 1950. More than 20 students' burials were undocumented . In December, researchers from the . University of South Florida in Tampa said they found evidence of at . least 50 graves on the school's property. In 2009, writer Roger Dean Kiser published The White House Boys - An American Tragedy detailing the horrors he experienced while incarcerated at Dozier School for Boys. He was sent to the reform school in 1959 when he was 12, and suffered brutal, bloody beatings in the infamous White House building. 'Little did I know that America had its own concentration camp for little boys right here in the good ole U.S. of A,' he wrote. 'A devil was hiding behind every tree, every building and even behind every blade of manicured grass.' He writes on his website: 'The terrible screams I heard and the brutal beatings I witnessed as a 12 year old will remain in my memory forever. 'The beatings I suffered are not my horrors today. My horrors are the beatings of crying boys that I had to witness before my own beatings. The horror of knowing that I was next. 'The thick concrete walls and the loud . industrial fan easily muffled the horrible screams of the boys as they . were beaten bloody. Some were carried to the hospital in wheelbarrows . and some had to have their underwear or pajamas surgically removed from . the buttocks. 'For almost thirty minutes, at age sixty-two, I stood alone in the exact room where I was almost beaten to death. With my heart racing and the side of my neck pulsating, I lit a cigarette and I cried without feeling shame.' They also found more grave shafts in . and around an area called 'Boot Hill', which rises across a major . highway from the high, razor-wire-topped fences of the closed school. There could be even more victims, but . researchers do not have access to records after 1960 because of privacy . laws, and overgrowth on the grounds has hindered them from full . searches. Dr Kimmerle said: 'All the focus on exact numbers is not really the issue. 'Whether it's one or 20 or 40 or 60, we are talking about a child and families that are asking for information.' Dozier School was closed in June 2011 . by the Department of Juvenile Justice after a years-long controversy . over widespread physical and sexual abuse. Previous investigations and lawsuits . have been brought by the 'White House Boys' - so called because of the . name of the squat, whitewashed building where much of the abuse took . place. A group of former students sued the . state in 2010, but their case was dismissed as the statute of . limitations had expired. Other students have written books about their . experiences. Following the claims, researchers at . the University of South Florida in Tampa used ground-penetrating radar . and soil samples and now believe there are many more bodies buried there . than previously reported. The largest gravesite is on the . northside of the campus, where African-American boys were buried. It is . at this site where the 31 graves are marked with white crosses, but . researchers believe they do not correspond with actual burial sites. 'We anticipated finding about 25 to 30 . grave shafts,' said Christian Wells, an assistant professor of . anthropology who led the anthropological work at the site. 'But in fact . we found a minimum of 50.' Discovery: University of South Florida radar research shows burial sites do not correspond with the crosses . Dozier's own records show that more . than 50 children were buried on the grounds, while more than 30 other . bodies were sent elsewhere to be buried. But the school failed to record burial . locations for 22 other children who researchers learned died on the . site, the Miami Herald reported in December. Some of the children - and two adults - . died in a fire and influenza outbreak in the early 1900s, while others . were reported to have suffered from ill health or physical traumas . Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi and other state officials are now seeking a court order to allow the remains to be exhumed. The U.S. Department of Justice has a . programme that could provide up to $3million for a thorough forensic . sifting of the burial areas, said U.S. Senator Bill Nelson, a Democrat, . who toured the site yesterday. A $200,000 appropriation is already pending in the state legislature. School grounds: Scientists believe there are bodies buried in wooded areas and unmarked graves .

He noted that 'the . statute of limitation on murder never runs out,' but added there is . little chance of prosecuting anyone. State Attorney Glenn Hess said only . one or two employees from the era are known to be alive, and it's . unlikely a trial could prove how a boy died or who was responsible.

A failed businessman was found guilty yesterday of shooting his parents dead four months after trying to drown them in a staged car crash. Fraudster Stephen Seddon blasted them with a sawn-off shotgun after learning he was the sole heir to their £230,000 estate. The luxury car salesman, who had massive debts, also planned to kill his disabled nephew, but by a stroke of luck he was not at home. Guilty: Stephen Seddon, 46, left,  shot his parents at their home with this shotgun, right. He was found guilty of killing them and is facing life in prison . Convicted: A man with an 'insatiable thirst' for money was facing life in jail today for the cold-blooded 'execution' of his parents for his £230,000 inheritance. Patricia and Bob are pictured with Stephen . Manchester Crown Court heard the . 46-year-old had first tried to kill Robert, 68, and Patricia, 65, by . driving a hired BMW into a canal with them strapped in the back. Seddon smashed his way out of the car and was later hailed a hero for ‘rescuing’ his parents and nephew. Yesterday police admitted that ‘with . hindsight’ they should have spotted that the canal incident was staged . and ‘handled it differently’. Seddon had previously enjoyed a luxury . lifestyle, owning a Porsche 911 Carrera, an Audi convertible and a . chauffeur-driven Bentley. It was claimed his firm had an annual . turnover of £5million and at one time he had £2million in his bank . account. But his lifestyle came ‘crumbling down’ when he was convicted . of fraud in 2000 and he became financially reliant on his parents. Seddon, who rubbed shoulders with . high-flying businessmen and footballers, killed his ‘quiet, unassuming’ parents despite them giving him £40,000 and buying him a home. The court heard Bob Seddon, 68, suspected that a earlier car crash into a canal was an attempt by his son . to kill him and his wife Patricia, 65 . Tragic: The couple's bodies were discovered after a neighbour raised the alarm and police broke into their house in Manchester . Prosecuting, Peter Wright QC, said: ‘He was spending money as fast as he received it. He was in his parents’ debt and deeply so. 'He was heavily reliant on their generosity. He was the sole beneficiary of their estate and he knew it.’ On the day of his parents’ deaths, unemployed Seddon had just £5 in his bank account and had been applying to payday lenders. After the shootings, the defendant . planted the gun in his father’s lap to make it look like a . murder-suicide at their home in Sale,   Manchester. Shocking: Seddon had previously tried to murder his father, Robert, 68, and mother Patricia, 65, by driving into a canal with them strapped in the back seats in a fake road accident . Health problems: Patricia Seddon was left unconscious after the crash, and was rushed to a nearby hospital . But ballistics reports were ‘entirely . inconsistent’ with this version of events. It was also revealed that . Seddon’s nephew, Daniel, 17, had narrowly escaped death. Police found the shotgun was loaded . and it was alleged that Seddon had been expecting three people at the . house. Luckily Daniel was in respite care at the time. Happier times: Robert and Patricia Seddon are pictured on their wedding day . The day before the murders, Robert Seddon had warned his GP that his son was trying to kill him. He had grown suspicious when he noticed his son had watched a programme on how to escape from a sinking car on his Sky Plus box. Following the killings, police launched an internal inquiry into the canal crash. Yesterday, Detective Chief Inspector . Denise Worth said: ‘Hindsight is a wonderful thing, and yes, looking . back now it could have been handled differently. ‘But at the time he came out of it as . a hero and it was treated like a tragic accident, but it was only after . the murders that we went back and looked at it in detail that we . realised things didn’t fit.’ Seddon’s first murder attempt took place on Mother’s Day last year at the Bridgewater canal in Timperley, Cheshire. Daniel managed to free himself and Seddon was seen on the roof of the car kicking the windows in and shouting for help. He told police he had suffered a heart . attack but hospital tests indicated he hadn’t. He also suggested the . car had hit a brick, but no debris was found. Four months later the father-of-three . of Seaham, County Durham, acquired a stolen shotgun from a contact in . Darlington before driving to his parents’ house. Police later found both victims had been blasted at close range. Seddon, who denied murder and attempted murder, will be sentenced today. Recovery: A salvage crew is pictured recover a black BMW car which Seddon drove into a canal in Timperley, Greater Manchester in an attempt to kill his parents . Stephen Seddon has become one of the very rare number of people whose greed drove him to the ultimate crime - not only murder but the murder of his own parents. For Seddon money was his 'whole world' and when he got it, he spent it fast. Even the lives of his mother and father were just an obstacle to overcome to get his grasping hands on cash. Close: Pat and Bob Seddon, pictured, had been married for 47 years . Detective Superintendent Denise Worth, of Greater Manchester Police, said: 'This job is probably one that is very, very difficult for anybody to contemplate. 'That anybody could kill their parents, to plan it, and to do it for money is indescribable. I cannot imagine that there are many people in the world that could do it.' Seddon was leaching off his parents' modest wealth for years before he murdered them.In one of the last acts of his life, his father paid his son's £60 speeding fine. His parents had already bought Seddon's home in Seaham, Co Durham to keep a roof over his family's heads. Seddon was supposed to pay his father rent - but it was not clear if money ever changed hands. Seddon grew up in Timperley, a Manchester suburb. His father worked for British Airways and the family were 'comfortable'. He began offending at the age of just 13, appearing before youth courts for offences of burglary, handling and theft. Grim: The bodies of the elderly couple were discovered after police were called to their home in Sale . Further convictions followed as an adult for taking vehicles without consent and he was jailed at Bolton Crown Court in 1989 for a series of offences including obtaining goods by deception, theft and making off without payment. He met his wife Nicola, an ex-model who is from the Sunderland area, in a lap dancing bar in Manchester 17 years ago and they moved to the North East. His offending continued and he developed a taste for the high life. He worked mainly in sales and in the late '90s set up a firm, European Business Support, providing grants to small businesses. The firm charged businesses £295 on the promise it would help secure European funding. His firm grew to an annual turnover of £5 million and he had £2 million in his bank account at one point. Ms Worth said: 'Seddon has had quite a lavish life in some respects. 'He has always had a fair amount of money. He has always had fairly well-paid jobs, so he has not had any financial difficulties. 'When he had his own company he had a really, really lavish lifestyle.' He bought a Bentley Turbo, hired a chauffeur and enjoyed jetting around the world, staying first class - again it was all just show. There were no European grants - he simply kept the cash. In 2000 Seddon pleaded guilty at Teeside Crown Court to fraudulent trading and was jailed for a year. In the weeks before killing his parents he was desperate for money, applying for high-interest, instant- access loans from various finance firms. On the day he carried out the killing he had just £5.45 in his bank account.","Stephen Seddon shot Robert, 68, and Patricia, 65, with a sawn-off shotgun .

Brussels was today accused of behaving like Oliver Twist after demanding even more mobey from the British taxpayer. There was fury from ministers as the European Commission asked the UK to find an extra £1.4billion  to cover a shortfall in this year’s budget. All member states are being asked to stump up a total of £9billion to cover overspending on regional development projects. Begging bowl: British politicians condemned the European Commission for demanding more from taxpayers, likening the move to the plea in Oliver Twist for more food . A £415million chunk relates to projects run by the EU’s foreign service headed by Baroness Ashton, whose members have already come under fire for their lavish spending on chartered planes and diplomatic residences. The budget shortfall costs more than the controversial £8.5bn Cyprus bailout. But it cannot be vetoed and only needs to be passed by a simple majority of the 27 member states. It has been demanded by disgruntled EU officials who have only reluctantly accepted hard-won cuts to the European from 2014 to 2020 negotiated by David Cameron last month in a marathon session. They made it clear they would veto the deal if unpaid bills for 2012 and 2013 - equivalent to around £77 per British household – are not paid this year before the budget cut comes in. In a terse statement yesterday, the EU’s commissioner for Financial Planning and Budgets, Janusz Lewandowski said members ‘should not be surprised’ at having to pay these extra costs. And he accused members – led by David Cameron - who say the EU should embrace austerity of acting like ‘ostriches’ by burying their heads in the sand as the bills for such projects mounted up. European Budget Commissioner Janusz Lewandowski (left) said national politicians should not be surprised at his demand for more money but Lib Dem MEP George Lyon said that at a time of family budgets being under strain, the EU was out of touch . Mr Lewandowski said: ‘This is creating a snowballing effect of unpaid claims transferred onto the following year. The ostrich policy can only work for so long: postponing payment of a bill will not make it go away. ‘Not one cent of the extra amount we request today is for the EU institutions, it will merely allow the EU to pay its share of projects that member states agreed to start in the past.’ Greg Clark, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, said: ‘This is a totally unacceptable request from the Commission at a time when most EU member states are taking difficult decisions to reduce public spending. ‘It is extraordinary that the Commission should demand an increase in the EU budget that is bigger than the rescue package that was agreed for Cyprus earlier this week.’ MEP George Lyon, who leads the . Lib Dem group in the EU parliament and sits on its budget committee, . said the EU was behaving like ‘the Oliver Twist of international . organisations’ – always asking for more, when it would not be clear . until the autumn what the final bills will be. He said: ‘It is hard to understand how . the Commission can justify this increase in the EU budget, long before . bills from member states are even through the door. ‘At a tough time for ordinary families . and citizens across Europe, EU spending cannot be out of touch with the . problems of the real world and people deserve some more answers.’ Among the schemes which receive this funding are adult education and language exchanges for university students, development and environmental projects in rural areas, and improving the competitiveness of the agricultural sector. The think tank Open Europe say the way this money is distributed is seriously flawed because if a rich region or country carries out an infrastructure project they must claim the money from EU, which has already been footed by their taxpayers, creating unnecessary bureaucracy. The EU has accused leaders like David Cameron of behaving like 'ostriches' by burying their heads in the sand on the need for more money . They say reforming it so only poorer nations can access infrastructure funding, while richer nations save money by funding their own, would save Britain £4billion over seven years. A spokesman said: ‘The Commission and MEPs’ demands for extra cash are unreasonable given the squeeze on national budgets and present a direct challenge to the UK and other national governments’ decision to cut the EU’s long term budget from 2014 onwards. ‘The EU needs to accept that circumstances have changed and that any outstanding projects should be funded from cuts elsewhere in the budget, for which there is ample scope.’ The EU say the estimates for these projects have gone up and they are under contract to foot the bill to avoid legal action or fines. Members pay a share of the budget according to their economic strength – so if the budget amendment is passed Germany foots the largest bill followed by France then Britain.","Extraordinary demand from European Commission to help plug £9billion shortfall likened to plea in Dickens' novel for more food .

Donald Trump has compared the decision to build an offshore wind farm next to his £750million Scottish golf course issue . to the release of the Lockerbie bomber, after ministers approved the controversial scheme. Plans for the 11-turbine scheme in sight . of the tycoon’s multi-million pound Aberdeenshire golf resort attracted . his wrath, as he fears it will spoil the scenic coastal views. But Energy Minister Fergus Ewing . yesterday gave the go-ahead for the European Offshore Wind Deployment . Centre (Eowdc), which could generate up to 100MW – enough to power . almost half of Aberdeen’s homes. Anger: U.S. property mogul Donald Trump has pledged to spend 'whatever is necessary' to stop the building of an offshore windfarm after Scottish ministers approved the scheme . Reacting to the news Mr Trump wrote: ‘The Scottish wind . farm was conceived by the same mind that released terrorist al-Megrahi.’ Mr Trump – who has faced objections to his golf resort at Balmedie – vowed to spend ‘whatever is necessary’ to block the scheme. He added: ‘This was a purely political . decision, as dictated by Alex Salmond, a man whose obsession with . obsolete wind technology will destroy the magnificence and beauty of . Scotland. Mr Trump claims the 11-turbine scheme will spoil the scenic coastal views . ‘Likewise, tourism, Scotland’s biggest industry, will be ruined. ‘We will spend whatever monies are necessary to see to it that these huge and unsightly industrial wind turbines are never constructed. ‘All over the world they are being abandoned, but in Scotland they are being built. We will put our future plans in Aberdeen on hold, as will many others, until this ridiculous proposal is defeated. ‘Likewise, we will be bringing a lawsuit within the allocated period of time to stop what will definitely be the destruction of Aberdeen and Scotland itself.’ The Scottish Government has  claimed that the development, which will lie 1.25-2.8 miles off the coast, will be capable of generating enough energy to meet the needs of 49,000 homes, almost half the number in Aberdeen. The scheme was put together by Vattenfall Wind Power and Aberdeen Renewable Energy Group (Areg).  The application pitted Mr Trump against Mr Salmond. Announcing the scheme, Mr Ewing said: . ‘Offshore renewables represent a huge opportunity for Scotland, an . opportunity to build up new industries and to deliver on our ambitious . renewable energy and carbon reduction targets.’ Mr Ewing said the sector could . generate more than £7billion for the economy in Scotland and support up . to 28,000 direct jobs and 20,000 indirectly by 2020. The First Minister, who is the MSP for Aberdeenshire East, said: ‘The North-East of Scotland is a world energy capital and, in order to continue to prosper, we have to be at the forefront of all forms of energy research – marine renewables, as well as oil and gas. ‘A deployment centre will put Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire in pole position for the development of offshore wind technology. Our ambition must be to see Scotland as the home of research, development, fabrication and deployment of deep-water marine technology.’ The £230m proposed wind farm will be in sight of Mr Trump's golf development on the Aberdeenshire coast . Eowdc project spokesman  Iain Todd said: ‘The Scottish  Government’s most welcome approval for the Eowdc is extremely positive news for both Scotland and the UK’s offshore wind industry as it helps position Scotland, the UK and Europe at the global vanguard of the sector.’ The scheme’s go-ahead also relies on Aberdeenshire Council approving a cable and substation development to bring the power onshore. A decision on that was deferred yesterday for a hearing as it emerged that several objections had been lodged.","American billionaire claims windfarm will ruin the view from his golf resort .

World-renowned violinist Min -Jin Kym was eating a sandwich at Euston Station when her violin was stolen. Police believe they may finally have traced it to Bulgaria . A £1.2 million Stradivarius stolen from a world renowned violinist as she sat in a railway cafe may have been recovered in Bulgaria. The rare instrument was taken as Min-Jin Kym ate in a Pret a Manger at Euston station in 2010. She had placed it on the floor as she say with her cellist boyfriend while she made a call on her phone. Irish traveller traveller John Maughan - working with two teenager accomplices as a distraction - snatched the instrument. The Stradivarius- one of only 400 in existence - has never been recovered. Maughan, completely unaware of its value, tried to sell it for just £100 to a man sitting next to him at an internet cafe but he was turned down because the man's daughter already had a recorder. Maughan, 41, was jailed for four and a half years at Blackfriars Crown Court in 2011. His own barrister said the violin was 'priceless and irreplaceable'. But the 1698 instrument, which Ms Kym bought ten years before the theft for £750,000, remained unaccounted for. Now police believe it may have been recovered after undercover detectives in Bulgaria were offered a Stradivarius for £250,000 from alleged gypsy crime boss Hristo Varbanov. The British Transport Police confirmed they are investigating whether the violin is Ms Kym's. Only three Stradivarius' are known to be missing and police believe there is a strong chance it is the same instrument. A spokeswoman said: 'We're trying to establish with the underwriters and international colleagues the instrument's background.' Ms Kym, who is signed to record label Sony BMG, was the youngest scholar ever at the Purcell school and has played with the Royal Philharmonic and toured Europe. Virtuoso Ruggiero Ricci said of her: 'She is that rare species - a born violinist'. There are only 400 violins made by legendary creator Antonio Stradivari left in existence and the finest Stradivarius examples are worth up to £8million (file picture) During the theft trial, prosecutor Mark James-Dawson said the violin represented the musician's life savings. He said: 'This isn't a female with a monumental amount of money. This is her life, her profession. 'She is one of the top violinists in the world and she has this instead of a house, instead of a car and she gets to a violin of this value by trading up as one would a mortgage as she's become more successful.' Ms Kym's violin was produced during . Stradivari's 'long pattern' period 1690 to 1699 when he experimented . with violins that were up 0.3in longer than his usual 14in model, . resulting in a tiny difference in sound. Antonio Stradivari set up shop in Cremona, Italy, in the late 17th century selling violins for 12 pistols, a local currency at the time but are now worth millions. In October 2010 a 1697 Stradivarius sold for £2.3million, which was originally thought to belong to Napoleon Bonaparte.","World-renowned violinist Min-Jin Kym had her rare violin stolen in 2010 .

The gang allegedly imprisoned Christopher Hipkiss after luring him to a flat in Hull, East Yorkshire, believing he was responsible for stealing £90 from one of their bank accounts. Liam Woods, 25, is on trial accused of binding Mr Hipkiss’s hands with cable ties during his ordeal  last April. Alexander Oades, Holly Norman and Jamie Mullenger have all pleaded guilty to false imprisonment. Oades held a knife to Mr Hipkiss’s face and ordered him to strip before forcing him to eat potpourri and cutting up his clothes with a knife, Hull Crown Court heard. He allegedly told Mr Hipkiss: ‘Look how easy it cuts through your clothes - think what it will do to you’. In a statement read to the court, Mr Hipkiss, 24, said: ‘Alex pulled out a knife, it looked like a shaving razor. He looked angry and was very intense and glaring at me. He held the knife towards my head and told me to get undressed. I was so scared, I didn’t question him.’ Oades allegedly ordered Woods to tie his hands.

He agreed he tied Mr Hipkiss’s hands . behind his back on orders from Oades but said he did not tie them . tightly and they came off instantly. Oades gave evidence for the prosecution and told the court Woods was as angry as him.

Fans of Radio 4’s The Archers have called for the BBC to take the show back to basics in the wake of its editor’s departure. Vanessa Whitburn will step down in May after 22 years, making her the longest-serving boss in the programme’s history. But although she has increased ratings, she has been heavily criticised for ‘sexing up’ the show unnecessarily. During her tenure The Archers has transformed from a sedate  tale of rural life to a serial filled with racy plots and steamy storylines. Miss Whitburn’s overhaul initially led to the popular show achieving record ratings in 2005 due to its ‘Who’s the daddy?’ storyline involving brothers Ed and William Grundy and William’s wife Emma. The programme received its  highest lunchtime audience of 2.44million and an average of 4.86million a week – the highest since January 2003. However, it was a different story several years later with some 200,000 listeners ditching The Archers in revolt over the controversial storylines, which by then had included a gay wedding and one of the central characters betraying her husband. Yesterday fans of the show posted comments on its website, underneath the announcement of Miss Whitburn’s departure, calling for the programme to return to its roots as a ‘simple story’ about rural and agricultural matters. One wrote: ‘Hopefully whoever takes over can rescue this once great programme and restore it to something approaching its former glory.

'Hopefully a new editor will concentrate less on sexual liaisons and more on the place of farming today and its importance to our future in producing high-quality food.’ Another listener said: ‘Return The Archers to its USP. A rural community based in Middle England. Have proper agricultural input. Have accuracy. Have reality.’ Miss Whitburn, a former producer of controversial Channel 4 drama Brookside, said she was departing to ‘take a holiday, develop a project for TV drama and get involved in some more training overseas’. She defended the changes she made, saying: ‘It’s zappier, it’s crisper, it’s faster and that’s because audiences require more.  I don’t think it’s necessarily  any racier.’","Editor of the show is leaving prompting calls for change in direction .

Royal Mail had wanted to lift protection for the country’s 115,000 postboxes, putting those in remote areas at risk of being removed to save money. But in a victory for rural communities, regulator Ofcom has insisted that the iconic red postboxes must be protected. Saved: Regulator Ofcom has insisted that the iconic red postboxes must be protected . Under its proposals, published yesterday, 98 per cent of Britons must have a postbox which is ‘within half a mile’ of their home. The distance is measured by a ‘straight line’ rather than along a winding road. It provides more protection for postboxes in obscure locations, such as nestled in the walls of cottages or hidden in bushes on country lanes by the sea. Yesterday the Department for Business said the new rules, which will be subject to a consultation ending on May 1, ‘can only be a good thing’. Under the current rules people must have a postbox ‘within 500 metres’ of their home. But the rules only cover areas where there are at least 200 delivery points – typically, a letter box – per square kilometre, which means people living in rural areas are left out. But while Ofcom agreed with Royal Mail that the current rules are ‘not fit for purpose’, it said they did not go far enough. An Ofcom report said: ‘They [the current rules] do not protect those users who are most likely to need protection – users in rural areas, where postboxes typically have lower volumes of mail and higher costs of collection per item.’ Foiled: Royal Mail had wanted to lift protection for the country¿s 115,000 postboxes, putting those in remote areas at risk of being removed to save money . Around 2 per cent of addresses would not be covered by the new rules. Typically these are in ‘very remote or isolated locations such as farmhouses’, Ofcom said. Royal Mail must provide ‘sufficient’ postboxes or alternatives. Claire Norman, from the Campaign to Protect Rural England said: ‘Quite apart from the iconic value of our much-loved red postboxes, they provide a vital and necessary service on which many still depend.’ Ofcom also ruled out getting rid of the first class next-day delivery service.

Sir Norman Bettison is likely to have been sacked had he not stood down in October last year . A former chief constable who oversaw the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster is likely to have been sacked if he was still a serving officer, it has been found. Sir Norman Bettison tried to influence public perception as the West Yorkshire Police Authority was deciding whether to refer him to the Independent Police complaints Commission following the Hillsborough Independent Panel report last year, the IPCC has concluded. It said: 'While it was evident Sir Norman made no attempt to prevent the referral happening, the IPCC investigation concluded that he attempted to manipulate the public perception of the referral process for his own self-interest.' The commission said its finding would justify Sir Norman's dismissal if he was still a serving chief constable. But lawyers for the former West Yorkshire chief constable said today that the way the IPCC conducted its inquiry 'calls into question the fairness of such a process'. The IPCC investigated his actions in relation to the process by which complaints about his involvement in the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster were referred to the commission. The former chief, who has always denied any wrongdoing, resigned from his post in West Yorkshire last year. The IPCC said in a statement today: 'The IPCC concluded Sir Norman had a case to answer for discreditable conduct and abuse of authority, breaches which, if proven in a disciplinary hearing, would amount to gross misconduct as they would justify dismissal. 'However, as Sir Norman left the police service in October 2012 he cannot face a disciplinary hearing in which the evidence could be tested. 'Instead, the IPCC is publishing its findings for the public to judge.' An investigation into Sir Norman's conduct in the period following the 1989 disaster that claimed the lives of 96 people, when he was involved in South Yorkshire Police's inquiry into what happened, is ongoing. IPCC deputy chair Deborah Glass said: 'The Hillsborough disaster and its aftermath have become synonymous in the public consciousness with allegations of police attempts to cover up the truth, manipulate messages and deflect blame. 'Sir Norman is facing investigation in relation to allegations that he played a key part in this. Complaints were sent to the IPCC about his involvement in the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster . 'We do not pre-judge the findings of that investigation. However, given the effect that those allegations have had on the public perception of him and policing generally, his attempts to manipulate and manage the perception of the referral of complaints about him, for his own self-interest, is particularly concerning. 'It is also conduct that falls far short of what should be expected of any chief constable. 'It was the IPCC's view at the start of the investigation, as it was the view of his Police Authority, that Sir Norman's actions, if proven, fell so far short of what is expected of a chief constable that dismissal would be justified. 'The evidence uncovered during the investigation supports that view. While we cannot bring this case to misconduct proceedings, we can publish the evidence and our conclusions, so that the public can judge for themselves. IPCC deputy chair Deborah Glass said the aftermath of Hillsborough had become synonymous with police attempts to cover up the truth, manipulate messages and defect blame . 'This case should also serve as a salutary reminder to chief officers everywhere of how much public confidence in policing is damaged when the conduct of leaders is called into question.' Sir Norman was a chief inspector with South Yorkshire Police at the time of the disaster. He attended the match at Sheffield Wednesday's ground as a spectator but, after the tragedy, he was involved in the subsequent force investigation. His involvement in that inquiry has provoked waves of allegations and criticism from the families of those who died and has dogged his career, which included a stint as the chief constable of Merseyside. Following the publication of the Hillsborough Independent Panel Report last year, Sir Norman was referred to the IPCC over claims that he gave misleading information in the wake of the tragedy and that he tried to influence West Yorkshire Police Authority's decision-making process in relation to the referral. He resigned as the West Yorkshire chief in October, saying it was because the controversy had become a 'distraction to policing in West Yorkshire'. In a statement issued through the police authority at the time, Sir Norman said he had never blamed the fans for the tragedy. And he dismissed a claim first highlighted by Merseyside MP Maria Eagle that he had once bragged to a fellow student in a pub about 'concocting' the police version of events, describing the allegation as 'both incredible and wrong'. At the time of his resignation, Sir Norman said the police authority and some of the candidates in the forthcoming Police and Crime Commissioner elections made it clear that they wanted him to go. Last month, Home Secretary Theresa May promised a crackdown on police who avoid disciplinary hearings because they resign or retire. Sir Norman was a chief inspector with South Yorkshire Police at the time of the disaster and was at the match as a spectator on the day . Mrs May said proposed reforms would mean such proceedings will be completed regardless of the officer's departure. In today's full report, the IPCC said: 'A finding that Sir Norman has a case to answer is not a finding that he is guilty. 'Such a finding could only follow a formal misconduct hearing in which the evidence would be tested and, as Sir Norman is no longer a police officer, such a hearing cannot be held. 'I am very mindful of the public concerns around officers resigning or retiring while under investigation, thereby escaping a misconduct sanction. 'I do find it unacceptable that officers take that option rather than facing up to the case against them. 'On 23 October 2012 Sir Norman announced his intention to retire with immediate effect. This decision was not under investigation, but it seems that, in this case, Sir Norman's departure was a direct result of actions by the Police Authority. 'It is clear from the evidence provided by both Sir Norman and the chief executive of the authority that, in fact, the police authority required Sir Norman to resign on 24 October 2012, and it was not Sir Norman's wish to go at this time.' According to today's report, the key issue was Sir Norman's desire to refer himself to the IPCC and, therefore, control the process. Sir Norman (pictured in 2008) today questioned the 'fairness' of the IPCC report . The report concluded: 'It is concerning that his first thoughts appear to have been to protect his own position. 'On . the balance of probabilities it is considered that the evidence . indicates that Sir Norman was trying to influence the decision-making of . the Police Authority because he wanted the public to believe that he . had referred himself to the IPCC, to avoid any public impression he had . done something wrong. 'Sir Norman put his own reputation as an individual above the need to ensure that a proper and transparent process was followed. Margaret Aspinall, of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, said Sir Norman should be stripped of his knighthood, police pension and other accolades . 'Sir . Norman's pre-occupation with what the public would think of him as an . individual led him to try to adopt a process, and persuade others to . adopt a process, which removed the independent consideration of the . issues from the committee whose responsibility it was to make that . decision. 'Instead, he was . trying to present them with a 'fait accompli' that they could then . endorse, rather than allow them to reach their own decisions without his . influence.' The IPCC found that, in doing this, Sir Norman exploited his privileged access to the police authority. It said: 'It is accepted that, following the publication of the Hillsborough Independent Panel report, Sir Norman was under a great deal of media scrutiny and criticism. 'While he may have wanted to try to mitigate that criticism, the way he tried to do that was not acceptable. 'His actions... do not suggest that he was seeking to avoid an investigation of his actions regarding the Hillsborough disaster. 'Instead, they can more accurately be described as seeking to manipulate the referral process and the way that referral and the investigation following that referral were seen by the public.' Reacting to the report, Margaret Aspinall, of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, suggested Sir Norman should be stripped of his knighthood, police pension and other accolades. She said: 'In the IPCC's own words, this was gross misconduct and, in my mind, that is a very serious offence and the fact that he resigned should not mean that this report is the end of it. 'We want to see him stripped of his honours - his knighthood and his Honorary Fellowship from Liverpool John Moores University. 'I believe he resigned to protect his pension and his behaviour has shown he is not deserving of that pension.' Mrs Aspinall, who lost her 18-year-old son, James, in the disaster, added that today's report was 'another step on the road to justice' for the 96 victims.

A Romanian gang wore pin-striped suits to trick their way into jewellers and carry out a £1million robbery campaign, a court heard. The Old Bailey heard today how the ten thieves came to Britain with the sole purpose of committing crime. After targeting a series of Indian and Turkish jewellers in London and Essex, the gang was finally caught red-handed as they attempted to rob another shop in north London in September last year. Targeted: The gang stole almost £250,000 worth of jewellery from Asha jewellers in Ilford, Essex, in April last year . The court heard that as they were rugby tackled to the ground by officers from the Met's Flying Squad, one of the gang members Ovidiu Gabor, 25, told them: 'I don’t care I go to prison to be on holiday.' Prosecutor Jonathan Polnay said: 'It appears that all came to this country with the sole purpose of committing robberies and taking part in this particular conspiracy.' 'These were not people who had come here for work and got diverted. This is effectively a professional gang who came here to rob.' The gang targeted Indian and Turkish jewellers because they held large quantities of gold which could be melted down. Jewellery which was suitable for the Romanian market was sold on market stalls and to pawn shops across the eastern European country. In each raid a smartly dressed man in a Trilby or a pin-striped suit would buzz the door to entry and then hold open the door to allow the others to run in with sledgehammers. Within minutes the gang would smash open the cabinets, grab as much jewellery as possible. They would run off across nearby railway lines, knowing that it was thought too dangerous for police to chase them. Catalin Paise, 19, Puiu-Danut Paunescu, 26, Marius Barbu, 25, Vasile Batarga, 23, Iulian Culba, 22, Ovidiu Gabor, 25, Ioan Gavrilit, 26, Constantin Irina, 30, Gheorghe Macovei, 23, and Iulian Roman, 21, are now all facing jail after pleading guilty to conspiracy to rob. Guilty: The ten Romanian thieves will be sentenced at the Old Bailey in London tomorrow . The Old Bailey heard a police officer had spotted ten Romanians with hammers and an axe on waste ground next in Wembley, northwest London, on March 26 last year. Two days later they raided a jewellers in Copland Road, Wembley, and got away with £511,287. A man approached the shop in a pin-striped suit and was let in through the first security door by staff. He then held the door open so three men wearing ski masks could burst in and smash through the second security door using sledgehammers. One of the robbers shouted: ‘Go down, go down or I will kill you’ and another swore in Gujarati. The staff managed to activate the panic alarm and smoke system but the robbers got away after setting a car on fire to divert the attention of the public and the emergency services. Police later recovered clothing thrown away by the gang as they fled and found a DNA link to Barbu, Macovei and Gavrilit. On April 5 the gang took £248,659 worth of gold from Asha jewellers in Ilford, Essex, using the same method. ‘The door was buzzed by a man dressed in a smart suit and trilby hat,’ said Mr Polnay. ‘The man held the door open and repeatedly wiped his feet. Then three or four men burst in through the open door and smashed their way in through the airlock. ‘Staff fled into the back room and locked the door. They could see on CCTV the shop being cleaned out.’ Detectives again recovered clothing linking Batarga and Barbu to the attack as well as three holdalls containing £73,146 of jewellery buried in a hole in the ground. On August 25 last year the gang struck at Pakeeza jewellers on Green Street in East Ham and stole gold worth £341,545. The gang next planned to raid a jewellers on Walworth Road near Elephant and Castle in south London on August 31 but backed out when a fire engine drew up by chance nearby. Caught: The gang were rugby-tackled to the ground by police after attempting to raid Sabha jewellers in Turnpike Lane, north London . Nearly two weeks later on September 12 Flying Squad officers watched the gang leaving the campsite and travelling by bus first to Romford and then Ilford and Stoke Newington. They were seen to stake out the shop in Butterfield Green but the gang backed out because of a large police presence in the area by coincidence. Three days later on September 15 the gang were watched as they attacked Sabha jewellers in Turnpike Lane, north London. Batarga, wearing sunglasses and a trilby hat, buzzed his way in followed by the rest of the gang. One of the robbers hit an elderly customer, Mohammed Hussain, with a sledgehammer on the knee to knock him to the ground. Mr Hussain said in a statement he had lived in the UK for 42 years and added: ‘I never had any problems with anybody. This incident has changed my entire life.’ The gang were arrested as they tried to leave the shop with £62,587 worth of jewellery. Gabor was rugby-tackled to the ground and arrested. When asked about the attack on Mr Hussain, he told officers: ‘**** him. I’m not interested.’ Paise was later arrested at the campsite and told officers He had only come to the UK to see the Paralympic Games. He said he didn’t know any of the others in the gang and added: ‘I haven’t come to this country to steal from people. It is a sin to do that.’ Roman also pleaded guilty to a £1million jewellery robbery in Handsworth, Birmingham, in February last year. Two men have already been sentenced. The court heard all ten robbers were living on a campsite in woodland near Gallows Corner in Romford, Essex. They were remanded in custody to be sentenced tomorrow.","Ten thieves came to Britain with 'sole purpose of committing robbery'

A New York man who admitted he faked his own death for insurance money has been arrested for pretending to be a police officer in an effort to lure women into his van. Raymond Roth, 48 of Long Island, was taken into custody on Tuesday after he allegedly pulled the stunt at least twice in the past month. In the first incident, on March 16, Roth allegedly pulled up next to a woman in Freeport, claimed he was a police officer and then demanded she get into the white van he was driving. When the woman refused and ran away, Roth followed her for a short distance before fleeing the scene, police said. Arrested: Raymond Roth, pictured, was caught on surveillance video after trying to kidnap women by impersonating a cop . On March 21, less than a week later, Roth allegedly pulled up next to another woman in the same area and repeatedly yelled at her to get into his vehicle. The woman ignored him and kept walking, but Roth threatened to arrest her if she didn't do as he ordered, police said. She ran into a nearby check cashing store and asked the staff to lock Roth, who had followed her on foot, outside. The man can be seen on surveillance video demanding the employees open the security door. Instead they called 911, but Roth ran away before police arrived. He was later tracked down by officers who charged him with criminal impersonation, attempted kidnapping and attempted burglary. Arrested: Raymond Roth is escorted by law enforcement officers after being arrested after he faked his own drowning at a New York beach in a scheme to collect on a life insurance policy . On March 22, Roth admitted faking his own death after he was caught out when he got a speeding ticket four days later. Roth had been reported missing in the waters off Jones Beach, New York, while swimming in July last year. Officers . combed the water near the beach during a massive rescue effort but, . days later and 730 miles away from home, Roth was stopped by police for . speeding in South Carolina. Nassau County District Attorney Kathleen Rice announced last week that he has now admitted a conspiracy charge in exchange for a sentence of 90 days in jail and five years' probation. He also must pay restitution for the cost of the search -- $27,445 to the U.S. Coast Guard and $9,109 to the Nassau County Police Department. Raymond Roth wanted his wife and son to collect at least $410,000 in life insurance benefits while he started a new life in Florida, Rice said. Scrum: He was arrested at a hospital where he was receiving psychiatric treatment for depression . Charges: Roth was arraigned on charges of insurance fraud, conspiracy to commit insurance fraud and falsely reporting an incident . The day before Roth was pulled over, . his wife, Evana, showed authorities e-mails she had discovered that . appeared to detail a plan between him and his son to fake his death. State police arrested both men in last August on charges of insurance fraud, conspiracy and filing a false report. Evana . Roth told CNN in August she thought her husband devised the plan after . he was fired from his job in July. Her attorney, Lenard Leeds, said she . had been unaware of the ruse before she uncovered the e-mail . correspondence. The son's . case is still pending, the district attorney said. Jonathan Roth's . attorney, Joey Jackson, defended his client after his arrest, saying, . 'There was abuse here, manipulation here, coercion here' from the . father. But Raymond Roth's attorney, Brian Davis, denied in August that Roth had involved his son in the scheme. 'Scheme': Roth's son Jonathan, left, and his attorney Joey Jackson after his appearance in court on charges that he helped his father to fake his death. Jonathan claims he was coerced . 'We . had issues concerning the facts people had whether (Roth) had an . agreement with his son,' Davis told CNN last Thursday. 'He's admitted it . now. He's accepted responsibility.' Davis added that his client has been under treatment for bipolar disorder in recent weeks. During plea negotiations, Raymond Roth asked the district attorney's office not to give his son jail time, Davis said. On the advice of both their attorneys, father and son have not been in contact since their arrests, Davis said. 'He would like to straighten things out with (Jonathan) when the time comes,' he said. Days after his disappearance, Raymond Roth was reported to be at a resort in Orlando, Florida and on August 2, he was stopped driving at 90 mph in Santee, South Carolina. Cost: Tens of thousands of dollars were wasted searching for Roth at Jones Beach, Long Island . Found: Roth left his shoes, wallet, clothing and phone on the beach when attempting to fake his death . Caught: More than a week after his disappearance, Roth was pulled over for speeding in South Carolina . When police ran his name, they saw he . was listed as missing, but Roth said he was driving back to New York . and the officer let him continue. But he failed to show up to a scheduled . meeting with police and his attorney claimed he had in fact been . admitted to hospital with depression. Jonathan Roth, 22, is free on $10,000 bond. He has pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to commit insurance fraud, filing a false report and other charges. Court papers show he 'was fully aware that his father never walked into the water and had in fact driven off in his own personal vehicle'.. He faces up to 15 years in prison if found guilty. The younger Roth's attorney, Joey Jackson, said his client and his father had a 'strained' relationship and claims he was coerced into going along with the scheme - which Davis has denied. He also claimed he feared for his life after his father left him a threatening voicemail when the scandal went public. Hurt: Roth's wife Evana said she has received numerous phone calls from him despite court order of protection . Up for sale: Roth had put his Long Island home on the market days before he faked his death and was allegedly calling about the sale . 'Listen, tough guy. You say you’ve been to the Marines and you can kill and everything else. When I get back, you are gonna do just that. One of us is going to die,' Mr Roth allegedly said. Raymond Roth's wife, Evana, said her husband had not told her of the scheme, and handed over emails she found on the family computer that implicated her stepson. In one dated the day before he vanished, the elder Roth told his son to contact him at an Orlando resort to update him on developments following his disappearance. 'This is a terrible nightmare that I just want to wake up from,’ said 43-year-old Evana. 'Why did he do this? I think I’m just numb.’ Raymond Roth had put the family's home up for sale just days before he vanished, and Evana Roth also said her husband had recently been fired from his job in New York City. Police estimated that an air and sea search for Roth cost tens of thousands of dollars.","Raymond Roth, 48, was charged with attempted kidnap on Tuesday after threatening to arrest women on at least two occasions if they didn't get into his van .

The bone, estimated to be worth between £10,000 and £15,000, is thought to be the first belonging to a dodo to come to auction since 1934. The bird was first recorded by Dutch sailors in 1598 on the island of Mauritius.  By the late 17th century, less than 100 years later, it had been hunted into extinction by humans. The auction house Christie's is selling a rare fragment of bone from the extinct dodo . The section of femur bone, estimated to be worth between £10,000 and £15,000, is thought to be the first belonging to a dodo to come to auction since 1934 . The bird was first recorded by Dutch sailors in 1598 on the island of Mauritius. By the late 17th century, less than 100 years later, it had been hunted into extinction by humans . The dodo bone is one of the few pieces of the extinct bird in private hands . James Hyslop, Head of Travel, Science and Natural History, at Christie's, said: 'As an icon of extinction, the dodo is second to none. From its appearance in Alice in Wonderland to the expression ‘dead as a dodo’, the bird has cemented its place in our cultural heritage. 'This exciting discovery is one of the few pieces of dodo material in private hands, and it is a privilege, and humbling experience, to have been entrusted with the bone. 'It is a reminder of the effect humans have on the natural world, and presents a rare opportunity to engage with this now lost and most enigmatic bird.' Christie's described the bone as 'a reminder of the effect humans have on the natural world' Scientists have met to discuss the possibility of bringing back 24 animals back from extinction . But a real life Jurassic Park is not an option, it is said, because dinosaur DNA is just too old. The so called 'de-extinction' of a number of species was discussed at a TEDx conference in Washington DC sponsored by National Geographic. They included the dodo bird, the Elephant Bird, last seen in 1904 in Florida, and the Quagga, a plains zebra which once lived in South Africa. The last wild one was shot in 1870 and the last in captivity died in 1883, the Journal reports. The teams chose the animals using a number of criteria, and discussed the ethics of bringing them back to life. Another marvel of the natural world, is also in the sale - a fossilised egg from the Elephant Bird (Aepyornis maximus) -  measuring more than 100 times the average size of a chicken egg. The extinct Elephant Bird, a native of Madagascar, was the largest bird ever to have lived. The egg - expected to reach between £20,000 to £30,000 stands at 8¾ inches (21cm) in diameter and 12 inches (30cm) in height. Similar in stature to a heavily-built ostrich with long legs and talons, it grew to around 11 to 10 feet in height and is thought to have been hunted to extinction in Madagascar between the 14th and 17th centuries. Fragments of eggs can be found in the Southern part of the island, but whole examples such as the the lot to be sold by Christie's are extremely rare. Also forming part of the lot is a recently discovered fine view of Port Louis, Mauritius, a lost work by William Hodges - the  official artist on Captain Cook’s second voyage around the world during the 1770s. This lost Mauritius painting probably dates from his voyage home from Hodges tour of India in 1785 and could fetch up to £100,000. A 1939 enigma machine, widely used during World War II to encrypt and decode messages sent between the German military and their commanders, is also estimated to reach £60,000.","Christie's is selling a rare fragment of femur bone from the extinct dodo .

The Minnesota Supreme Court has ruled that a set of white foster parents should raise two toddler sisters instead of the black grandparents who have fought for them for three years. Steven and Liv Grosser, from Plymouth, will now raise the girls instead of Dorothy and Lawrence Dunning after the court ruled relatives should get first consideration but not preference in adoptions. Princess and Dorothy Knox, who are now aged three and two, were placed with the Grossers after doctors found they both had traces of cocaine in their blood after they were born. As a result of the pre-natal drug ingestion, they both suffer from developmental difficulties and the court ruled that the Grossers are better placed to provide for them. Scroll down for video . Success: Steven and Liv Grosser, pictured, have been granted custody of two toddler sisters over their paternal grandparents as a court ruled they were better placed to provide for the girls . But the Dunnings, from Gautier, Mississippi, have fought a hard battle for their granddaughters, and argue that blood relations, love and heritage should come before money. State laws say that race should not factor in to adoptions but require that a child's 'cultural needs' should be a consideration when determining a child's best interests. The Grossers' attorney, Wright Walling, told the Minnesota Star Tribune that there were grey areas over the word 'culture'. 'From my perspective it was never about . race, except to the extent that their race and culture is who these . children are,' Walling said. 'But what does culture mean? My clients . living in the suburbs? My clients being white? Mrs. Dunning living in . rural Mississippi? The kids living in Minnesota? Those issues have yet . to be flushed out.' But the Dunnings' attorney, Michael . Perlman, countered that race was - and should have been - a factor . during the adoption proceedings. Separated: Dorothy Dunning said she loves her granddaughters, Princess and Dorothy (pictured), and that her ability to provide for them, as well as her blood connection to them, should come before wealth . 'Even if their hearts are in the right . place, they can't give these children the same culture, the same . history, the same experiences that relatives can,' he told the Star Tribune. The battle began in 2009 when Princess tested positive for cocaine and was placed with the Grossers days later. The Dunnings requested to adopt her, but the paperwork was 'stalled', the Star Tribune reported. When Dorothy was born in 2010, . officials asked the Grossers if they would adopt her as well, and the . couple, who have seven other children, agreed. Hennepin County District Judge . Kathryn Quaintance said the girls should stay with the Grossers as they . could better help their special needs and moving the girls from the home . could affect them. But the Dunnings argued that they could provide a good home for the girls so no other home should have been considered. Grief: Dorothy Dunning has uploaded videos to YouTube in which she shares her heartbreak over the battle . Difficulties: The girls were put in foster care after they were both born with traces of cocaine in their blood . Despite her objections and a heartfelt media campaign by Dorothy Dunning to gain custody of her granddaughters, the Minnesota Court of Appeals sided with the Grossers. The Minnesota Supreme Court heard the case in January and reached their decision on Wednesday, ruling in favour of the Grossers 5-2. Justice Paul Anderson wrote that family members should be considered but that there is no reason not to consider other potential parents when deciding what is in the child's best interest. But Justice Alan Page argued that the relative's petition should be considered first and others should only be looked at if they are not providing adequately for the child. He wrote: 'I do not believe that the Legislature intended that relatives - who can meet the child's needs and offer a loving home - be passed over merely because nonrelatives may be marginally ""better"" in some sense, such as being more affluent or better educated than the relative.' Decision: The Minnesota Supreme Court ruled in favour of the Grossers by a majority of 5-2 . Dorothy Dunning had previously shared her anguish in a series of YouTube videos and in an editorial for the Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder. She wrote that she only learned her grandchildren were in care when she called the Department of Children's Services to express her concern that her son and the children's mother were on drugs. 'I wanted my babies to be in a safer environment. I then found out that my grandchildren were in the custody of foster parents,' ,' she wrote in January 2012. 'I am so appreciative of the care of . their foster parents, but I am the biological grandmother, and I am not . giving up my rights for the belief that they belong with me. 'Although the foster parents may have . multiple degrees and earn more money than we do, I am a proud and hard . worker, and so is my spouse. I've never turned to the government for any . assistance. Thoughtful: The Grossers celebrated their win on Facebook but said their thoughts were with Dorothy . 'I know that money does not give love, . and I love my grandchildren and desire that they experience the love. This is not and never has been . about the finances... I am their grandmother and will always be their grandmother.' But as the Dunnings struggled to come to terms with the ruling, the Grossers took to their Facebook page to celebrate their win - and to pass on their thoughts to the Dunnings. 'Justice has been done for two little girls to stay with the only family they have ever known,' Liv Grosser wrote. 'I know Dorothy is feeling sad and my heart is heavy for her... We will continue to honor her as the girls' grandma and we hope we can become friends soon. Please pray for Dorothy as she comes to grips with this decision that she can see that it is best for the girls.'","Minnesota Supreme Court ruled that Steven and Liv Grosser could better provide for the sisters who have lived with them since they were babies .

Taking longer to become pregnant led to a 30 per cent increased risk of having a child with mild neurological problems . Women who take a long time to get pregnant are at one-third higher risk of their child having ‘mild’ neurological problems, say researchers. The finding may also help explain why children born after fertility treatment are more likely to have developmental difficulties. It is well known that children conceived as a result of fertility treatment are at a higher risk of premature birth and low birth weight. But evidence is now emerging that poor fertility plays a critical role, rather than IVF, say Dutch researchers. They assessed the neurological development of 209 children at the age of two - all of whom were born to parents who had struggled to conceive, and most of whom had had fertility treatment. Impaired fertility is defined as failing to become pregnant after 12 months. The researchers found mild neurological problems affected 17 of the children - just under eight per cent - and were significantly more common among those whose parents had taken longer to conceive. Taking longer to become pregnant led to a 30 per cent increased risk of giving birth to a child with mild neurodevelopmental problems. The researchers assessed movement, posture and muscle tone, reflexes, and eye-hand coordination in the children, and took into account the parents’ ages. The time taken to get pregnant among their parents averaged just over four years, but ranged from 1.6 to just over 13 years. Evidence is now emerging that poor fertility plays a critical role in development . Parents whose children did not have these problems took an average of two years and 8 months to conceive, but ranging from one month to 13 years. The study was published online in the Fetal & Neonatal Edition of Archives of Disease in Childhood. Lead author Professor Mijna Hadders-Algra, Departmenf of Paediatrics, Division of Developmental Neurology, University of Groningen, said: ‘In conclusion, the present data suggest that increased time to pregnancy is associated with suboptimal neurological development. ‘This implies that factors associated with subfertility may play a role in the genesis of neurodevelopmental problems.’ Further research will be needed before couples can be given advice based on this finding, she said.","Taking longer to become pregnant led to 30% increased risk of having a child with mild neurological problems .

He has now undergone 20 operations, including three facelifts, and a ‘smile transplant’ which involved having tissue from his leg implanted into the corners of his mouth. He also had surgery to insert two small gold weights into his eyelids so he could sleep with his eyes properly shut. Mr Smith, an accountant from Halesowen, West Midlands, said: ‘It’s changed my life. I literally haven’t been able to stop smiling since the operation was deemed a success. ‘I didn’t want to go out because people stared at me and kids asked what the matter was. Now it’s just normal to look at me. ‘It’s taken a long time, it’s been about eight years but it’s come right. ‘It’s been worth it, there’s no doubt about that. It’s changed my life. ‘I thought I’d never be able to smile again. Now I can talk to people and have a laugh and joke with them and they know now that I’m smiling. ‘The things they can do nowadays are unbelievable. Mr Smith says that he was always laughing and smiling before a nerve in his face was damaged during tumour removal surgery . ‘I thought I’d never be able to smile again. ‘The entire right side of my face was left drooping and I stopped smiling completely.’ He added: ‘Even when I was happy or laughing at a joke I still looked grumpy. It was horrible. ‘People felt awkward around me because I couldn’t laugh along or smile at jokes. ‘I used to laugh all the time, but I wasn’t able to do that anymore. ‘The worst thing was when it came to having my picture taken and trying to smile for the camera. Pictured in 2007 before reconstructive surgery Mr Smith could not smile or close his eyes properly . The grandfather, who is pictured with his wife Lesley, says that he avoided going out before his reconstructive surgery as people would stare at him . ‘Children would stare at me and then ask their mum loudly “what’s wrong with that man?” ‘In the end I used my hand to prop up my cheek so it was less noticeable. ‘I used to walk around with my hand stuck to my face because I was so conscious about my face.’ Mr Smith’s nightmare began in May 2005 when he was refereeing a football match and noticed ringing in his ears and began suffering balance problems. He underwent an MRI scan which found he had a benign acoustic neuroma - a tumour - in his ear. Following surgery Mr Smith is now able to share a joke with his wife again . In October that year the tumour was removed, but a nerve was damaged and he suffered facial palsy – paralysis of the face. After three facelifts at Birmingham’s Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Mr Smith was referred to Demetrius Evriviades, a consultant Plastic and Reconstructive Microsurgeon. He operated on Mr Smith twice in 2007 and again in 2008 to transplant tissue from his leg into his cheek. Both operations failed but the third transplant in November 2009 was deemed a success and Mr Smith started intensive physiotherapy to strengthen his facial muscles. The grandfather, who lives with his wife of 33 years, Lesley, 56, added: ‘When Demetrius first looked at my face, he said “we will sort it out”. And I trusted him. ‘My smile finally came back bit by bit as I had the physio. ‘I had to clench my teeth to smile at first. Then the whole face started to move. ‘Now I can talk to people and have a laugh and joke with them and they know now that I am smiling. ‘The nicest thing for me now is that I can once again smile at my wife. It was depressing not being able to share a laugh with her for so many years.’ Mr Evriviades said: ‘It is quite a rare operation, I have carried out only eight in total. ‘With John, both the nerves and muscle in the affected side of the face had gone, so we needed to bring in a new muscle and use another nerve. Plastic and Reconstructive Microsurgeon Demetrius Evriviades inserted tiny gold weights into Mr Smith's eyelids to allow him to close his eyes properly again . ‘It takes about three months for the nerve to recover and the muscle starts to work. ‘To achieve the best results it takes a lot of hard work and physiotherapy after the operation as the patient learns how to smile again. ‘Initially the patient has to bite their teeth to smile but fairly soon they learn to do it without biting their teeth. ‘John now has a spontaneous smile.’","John Smith, 58, suffered nerve damage during surgery to remove a tumour .

A Tibetan mother of four young children has killed herself in the latest self-immolation protest against Chinese rule. Kalkyi, 30, doused her body in petrol before lighting a match near a monastery in Sichuan province's Aba county in western China yesterday. The mother died at the scene and her body was placed in the nearby Jonang Tibetan Buddhist monastery, Radio Free Asia reports. Her death comes just a week after 28-year old Kirti monk Lobsang Thogme set fire to himself on March 16 in Aba. Protest: Mother-of-four burned herself to death in protest against Chinese rule in Sichuan province's Aba - bringing the number of Tibetan self-immolations so far to 110 . Rising numbers: Kalkyi's death bring the total number of self-immolation to 100. Tibetan exile Jamphel Yeshi, 27, is pictured running as his body is engulfed in flames on March 26, 2012 . Aba has seen the largest number of the 110 self-immolation protests that first began in 2009. Many of the deaths have occurred in the last two years. There were 25 deaths - aged between 15 and 30 - in November alone, according to campaigners. Tibetan rights advocates say the self-immolations aim to protest Chinese rule and call for the return of exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama. China accuses the Dalai Lama's supporters of encouraging the suicides. Kalkyi joins a rapidly growing list . of young Tibetans so angry at their Chinese rulers that they are willing to . make the ultimate sacrifice in a bid to draw the world's attention to their region's plight. Self-immolations in Tibet have become so common in recent months that they happen on an almost weekly basis. There have been a total of 110 since the first self-immolation in . connection with the fight for an independent Tibet was reported in 2009. The . protests, which sees individuals douse themselves in flammable liquid . and set themselves alight, are reportedly inspired by the acts of . Buddhist monks during the Vietnam war in the 1960s. Tibetans currently have no legal recourse to protest against Chinese rule, making traditional demonstrations impossible. Those who do face severe repercussions, with reports of physical assaults on Tibetans by Chinese security forces. Calls to the local government and police rang unanswered today. Self-immolations reveal the desperation among Tibet's youth after 60 years under Beijing's thumb. The Chinese government has sought to crack down on Tibetan dissidents issuing a stern warning to the authorities of eastern Tibet to punish all self-immolators and their relatives - and even those who send condolences to bereaved families. It said all government aid would be removed from the families of self-immolators while development projects in communities that have been home to such protesters would be cancelled. The charity and campaign group Free Tibet says it has documented multiple cases of collective punishment, imposed against the communities and families were individuals have set themselves on fire, or were other forms of protest have taken place. It says punishments have included homes being ransacked, development projects which were planned for a village cancelled and ‘public criticism’. Of the 110 protesters who have set themselves on fire, the majority have died of their injuries. Those who survive, are arrested and taken away. They are rarely seen again, say campaign groups. Stephanie Bridger, director of Free Tibet, said: 'Tibetans from all walks of life, young and old, mothers, nomads, students, monks and nuns are rejecting China’s occupation of their homeland. 'China is trying to crush protest through arbitrary detention, collective punishment, communications blackouts, bribery and much more – this has only strengthened the resolve of the Tibetan people in their struggle for freedom. Tibetan exiles shout slogans against the Chinese government at a protest in New Delhi, India, earlier this month . Marching for freedom: Tibetans march through the North Indian town of Dharamshala on the 54th anniversary of the Tibetan Women's Uprising Day, when thousands of Tibetan women gathered in protest against China's occupation of Tibet . 'Free Tibet is receiving reports of protests inside Tibet on an almost daily basis. These protests will only continue until each and everyone one of us stands with the Tibetan people in their struggle for freedom and our Governments stop kowtowing to an unelected Chinese regime.' But it is also a moral and policy dilemma for Tibet's spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, and a new generation of exiled politicians. The Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 with hundreds of followers and they set up base in Dharamsala, a town in the Himalayan foothills about 400 km (250 miles) north of New Delhi. The deaths raise theological questions about non-violence and highlight a long-standing schism between the elderly Dalai Lama's softly, softly approach to China and activists who want to fight for independence.

Victim: Former McDonald's employee Louise Ogborn was made to strip naked and perform star jumps in front of her boss on the orders of a hoaxer pretending to be a police officer on the phone . The surreal true story of a McDonald's employee stripped naked by her boss who had fallen victim to an elaborate hoax is the subject of a new film. McDonald's staff member Louise Ogborn, 18, had been working at the Mount Washington branch in Kentucky, America, for four months when she was falsely accused of stealing a customer's purse in 2004. Her boss, assistant manager Donna Summers had received a phone call from a man pretending to be a police officer and, on his instruction, subjected her employee to a three-hour ordeal where she was stripped naked, abused and humiliated. It was only when another employee demanded McDonald's head-office be contacted that staff realised they had been duped by a phone hoaxer who is believed to have targeted managers of more than 70 fast food outlets across America. The bizarre episode is the basis for new movie Compliance, starring Dreama Walker, which opened yesterday. It all started when Summers received a phone call from a man claiming to be a police officer who told her that Ms Ogborn was a 'thief' who needed to be held until officers arrived at the scene. On the officer's instructions, Summers called Ms Ogborn into the office, took her car keys and phone and locked the door. The fake police officer then told Summers she must make the teenager strip naked and put her clothes in a bag to preserve evidence. Incredibly, the assistant manager did as she was told, believing the caller to be a genuine policeman. Scroll down for video . Convicted: Donna Summers, left, was sacked by McDonald's and given a year's probation while her former fiance Walter Nix, right, was jailed fro five years for sexually abusing Ms Ogborn . CCTV footage: Louise Ogborn, then 18, had been working for McDonald's for four months when she was called in to the office at the Mount Washington branch in Kentucky and accused of stealing . Phone hoax: Ms Ogborn's boss Donna Summers then told her to strip naked on the orders of 'Officer Scott' speaking on the telephone . Summers made Ms Ogborn dance naked with her hands above her head, perform jumping jacks and deep knee bends. On the instruction of Officer Scott', she then got her fiancé Walter Nix, 42, to continue the 'punishment', forcing Ms Ogborn to sit on his lap, have her buttocks slapped and finally to perform a sex act on him. Another manager and two employees saw the abuse happening but did nothing as they believed it was being conducted on police orders. It was only when 58-year-old maintenance worker Thomas Simms refused to take over the abuse and demanded an area manager be contacted the episode ended. Helpless: Ms Ogborn can be seen wiping her eyes as Summers continues to take orders from over the phone . Trapped: Summers also took Ms Ogborn's car keys and mobile phone so she had no way escaping or calling for help . Summers claimed the caller sounded so convincing she was happy to do whatever he said. She continued: 'When I asked him why he always had an answer. I honestly thought he was a police officer.' She said she begged Ms Ogborn for forgiveness as soon as she realised her mistake and called of her engagement to Nix after viewing CCTV of what he had done. The pair were taken to court and Nix was jailed for five years for sexual abuse while Summers was sacked and got a year's probation for false imprisonment. Ms Ogborn sued McDonald's for £127million but later accepted £700,000 out of court. Ms Ogborn said she did what she was told because she was terrified of losing her £4.20-an-hour job but claimed she did beg her managed to let her go, the Daily Mirror reports. Bizarre: A man can be seen in the office appearing to hold Ms Ogborn while Summers can be seen sitting down on the other side . Abuse: Ms Ogborn can be seen to dance around naked in front of man as he talks on the phone to the hoax caller pretending to be a policeman . She said: 'My parents taught me when an adult tells you to do something that's what you do. You don't argue, you listen. 'Every time Donna came in the room I begged ""Get me out of here. I didn't do anything"". I was bawling my eyes out and begging them to take me to the police station.' It was not the first time a hoax caller has managed to convince fast food managers to abuse their staff by pretending to be a police officer. A similar episode occurred at a Missouri drive-in just a month earlier. In total, seven people have been jailed for performing strip searches on members of staff after falling prey to hoax callers. Father-of-five David Stewart was accused of being being the series of calls but was acquitted in 2006 of impersonating a police officer, solicitation to commit sex abuse and unlawful imprisonment because of lack of evidence.

Isolated: Cameron Douglas has been placed in solitary confinement after a urine test revealed he had drugs in his system, sources say . The junkie son of actor Michael Douglas has been sent to solitary confinement after a urine test revealed he had drugs in his system, it was revealed today. A source said that the troubled Cameron Douglas was taken from his cell at a federal prison in Loretto, Pennsylvania and moved to a holding cell. It is the latest string of mishaps for the crystal meth dealer, after he had his femur broken in December by an unknown group of inmates. Sources told the New York Post that Douglas was found with traces of drug in his urine. Douglas is currently serving out a ten-year sentence for smuggling drugs and dealing crystal meth. In December, a New York court heard how he had persuaded his besotted defence lawyer to smuggle drugs to him, hidden  in her bra. The 34-year-old admitted he had shared the drugs with other inmates, and had also smoked cigarettes, gambled, snorted substances and committed other infractions while in prison. Following these offenses, a judge doubled his original five-year sentence to ten. The appalling history and extent of Douglas’s drug problems were revealed as his legal team returned to court to appeal against that decision. It came just a few days after Douglas reportedly suffered a broken leg and finger in a prison attack. Papers submitted to the appeals court revealed that Douglas had persuaded his defence lawyer to sneak drugs into prison in her bra on at least three or four occasions. Michael Douglas, pictured in 2002 with son Cameron, has previously said that he thought prison might be a good thing for his troubled son . Jennifer Ridha, 33, put contraband Xanax anti-anxiety pills inside a balloon, which she slipped inside her underwear. Douglas’s current lawyer, Paul Shechtman, said she ‘apparently became enamoured of Cameron during  frequent visits’. Judge Richard Berman, who extended Douglas’s original sentence, said he had never ‘encountered a defendant who has so recklessly and wantonly and flagrantly and criminally acted in as destructive and (as) manipulative a fashion as Cameron Douglas has’. But Mr Shechtman called the additional five years ‘shockingly long’ and said it ‘may be the harshest sentence ever imposed on a federal prisoner for a drug possession offence’. He also blamed his client’s long history of substance abuse on a lack of parental support when he was growing up. ‘While still a young teenager, he drank heavily and began selling drugs,’ Mr Shechtman said. ‘He used illegal drugs to self-medicate – to ward off depression and panic attacks.’ Before his conviction Cameron, the only child of Michael Douglas’s first marriage to Diandra Luker, had been arrested several times over drugs but never prosecuted. Michael Douglas, pictured in 2009, with son Cameron who has suffered a broken leg and fingers after being attacked in prison . But in July 2009 he was held in a . Manhattan hotel and accused of distributing and conspiring to distribute . more than 4.5 kilograms of methamphetamine and 20 kilograms of cocaine . over the previous three years. At the time, he was so visibly high on heroin that he had to be taken to hospital before he could go to court. It later emerged he had been injecting himself with heroin five or six . times a day for the past five years, according to the new court papers. He was released from custody on the condition that he remain under house . arrest with a private security guard. But within days, he persuaded his . girlfriend, Kelly Sott, to smuggle him heroin hidden inside an electric . toothbrush. His bail was revoked and he was sent to prison. He admitted narcotics distribution charges and was jailed for five . years, avoiding a mandatory ten-year sentence by cooperating with . investigators. Two drug suppliers were arrested and convicted as a result of his information and Douglas testified at the trial of one. This reportedly led to the attack this week, which is said to have . happened during a prison game of American football.

At the original sentencing, Judge Berman noted that Douglas’s family had . tried to help him, but he had refused, and that two decades of drug . addiction treatment had been unsuccessful. Incarceration, the judge noted, had produced the longest period of sobriety Douglas had ever known since he was 13. In the court papers, it emerged that Douglas – who had roles in four . minor films – began using intravenous cocaine at the age of 20. He swiftly moved on to heroin and, by the time he was 25, ‘his life revolved around [the drug]’, Mr Shechtman said. His friends were fellow users  who gravitated to him because of his . access to family money, which supported their habits, the lawyer said. He added that Douglas’s ‘exasperated’ father cut off his son’s allowance . when he refused to go into rehab, forcing Cameron to turn to drug . dealing to pay for his habit. Mr Shechtman argued that the judge had gone too far with Douglas, punishing an addict for something beyond his control. ‘While we recognise that many of the words that the district court used . to describe Cameron’s conduct – “reckless”, “manipulative”, . “destructive” – were apt, the simple truth is that Cameron Douglas is a . heroin addict who has yet to shake his habit,’ he said. His 68-year-old father has previously said he had a strained . relationship for many years with his own father, Kirk, and acknowledged . that he may have repeated that pattern with Cameron. ‘Kirk was all-consumed, was overworked. Probably like myself at a certain time in my life,’ he said.

A salesman from the firm behind last year's devastating outbreak of meningitis has revealed how the lab made up prescriptions for fake customers in order to maximise its profits. New England Compounding Center, where the fungal disease which has killed 48 originated, was only supposed to manufacture drugs for individuals as it was not regulated by federal officials. To get round the ban on large-scale production, clinics requested prescriptions with invented names such as 'Bill Smith', 'Jane Doe' and even 'Homer Simpson'. Another worker claims he warned his boss that 'something's going to happen' just a month before the first of the firm's patients died from meningitis, but was totally ignored. Scroll down for video . Revelations: Technician Paul Connolly, left, and an unnamed salesman, right, have spoken out about alleged wrongdoing at New England Compounding Center . NECC, based in the suburbs of Boston, provided a steroid which turned out to be contaminated to dozens of clinics around the U.S. Nearly 50 people have died and more than 700 were hospitalised after they contracted fungal meningitis from being injected with the steroid, which was supposed to control back pain. All those affected had been treated with drugs from NECC, which was not regulated by the FDA as it was only licenced to compound drugs for specific individuals on receipt of a prescription. But a salesman for the firm told CBS's 60 Minutes that the company was in fact acting as a drug manufacturer, and claimed that it had as many as 3,000 clients despite presenting itself as a 'mom and pop specialty pharmacy'. In order to circumvent the ban on large-scale manufacture, clinics would allegedly submit prescriptions under fake names and pretend these were their patients. Outbreak: Drugs mixed by the firm have been linked to a recent epidemic of fungal meningitis . 'Bart Simpson, Homer Simpson - those ones did raise red flags, and we would call our client back, and say, ""Hey, give us different names,""' the unnamed salesman said. 'The follow-up names would be like a John Doe, Jane Doe, Bill Doe - you know, Jane Smith, Bill Smith.' When NECC staff continued to object, he said, 'Sometimes [clients] would take a phone directory within their office, and scribble out their extensions, and fax it over to us.' He added that the company employed 30 sales representatives, but claimed that when inspectors visited its headquarters the sales team was told to stay away so as not to raise suspicions. Joe Connolly, a former technician at Clean Room One where much of the contaminated material was made up, said that a year before the meningitis outbreak the firm started to increase its output by up to 1,000 times. 'We became a manufacturer overnight,' he told 60 Minutes. 'So we were basically trying to have the best of both worlds. It was trying to manufacture without the oversight of a manufacturer.' Product: Pictured are the vials of the . injectable steroid used to treat back pain made by New England . Compounding Center implicated in the fungal meningitis outbreak . He said that technicians had found mould in the laboratory around a dozen times in the three years leading up to the start of the scandal. According to Mr Connolly, late last summer he approached his supervisor and said: 'Something's going to happen. Something's going to get missed. And we're going to get shut down.' He apparently expressed concerns the lab's products would 'hurt a patient' - but his worries were ignored by management. In September, patients who had been treated with methylprednisolone acetate originating from NECC began to fall ill with meningitis. The firm was rapidly shut down by the FCC, and has now gone out of business. Owner Barry Cadden has refused to comment on the allegations made by 60 Minutes, and invoked the Fifth Amendment to avoid testifying to Congress.

This means the changes to the law it proposes would affect the general public, but would also have a significant impact on specific groups. Because it is part of a bill, the environmental statement has to be delivered to Parliament as a hard copy – which, at more than half a ton, will weigh almost as much as a Smart Car. The report will also have to be printed for every local authority along the HS2 line. The Department for Transport, however, does not agree with government protocol that all bills must be printed, and is urging Commons authorities to allow it to deliver the statement in electronic format.

Robert Louis Stevenson may well have paced up and down the garden, pondering the next twist to one of his adventure novels. And, nearly a century later, stars of the 1960s such as Elizabeth Taylor and Peter Sellers enjoyed summer parties on the same lawn. But the next chapter in the history of this London garden and the attached Grade II-listed cottage is rather less illustrious. Debbie Dove says she has been harassed by neighbours over her plans to build an underground spa at her Hampstead home, pictured, which used to belong to Robert Louis Stevenson . The current owner wants to dig it up and build a basement health spa for the use of her teenage daughters. It’s not a popular step with her neighbours in upmarket Hampstead. Multi-millionaire Debbie Dove, who reportedly has an £80million property portfolio, has submitted plans for a leisure complex with a swimming pool, waterfall feature, spa, gym and bar. This will require digging more than six metres under the garden of Treasure Island author Stevenson’s former home – where 50 years ago some of the biggest names in British film gathered for parties. Neighbours say the proposal is not in keeping with the area but twice-divorced Miss Dove, 52, who has another property backing on to the cottage, claims they have been harassing her and she is now considering legal action. ‘I have been texted and emailed constantly,’ she said. ‘They have said that, for my own benefit, it would be better to drop my planning application. ‘We are literally going to have to go for harassment soon. All the neighbours in the nearby area have rallied against me.’ The three-bedroomed Netley Cottage, built in 1779, is close to the Hampstead Garden Suburb, known as Billionaires’ Row, and is a popular area with rich and famous. Neighbours are opposing the development at the Hampstead cottage, which has its own terrace and lawn, because they say it is not in keeping with the area . Treasure Island author Robert Louis Stevenson once owned the Hampstead cottage . Coldplay singer Chris Martin and his wife, actress Gwyneth Paltrow, as well as actress Kate Hudson and comedian Michael McIntyre all reportedly live nearby. After putting the property on the market in 2010, Miss Dove decided to keep it so 14-year-old twin daughters, Viviana and Isabella can live there when they are older. If the proposals win Camden Council’s approval, the underground spa would be covered by a turfed roof, which architects say will be in keeping with the rest of the large property. Miss Dove separated from second husband, divorce lawyer Raymond ‘Jaws’ Tooth in 2008. His clients include Sadie Frost and Patti Boyd. In the early Nineties, Miss Dove married first husband, Italian aristocrat Giovanni Fiorentino, father of her twins. The marriage lasted 11 years. Miss Dove, a former local estate agent, said: ‘I wouldn’t dream of doing anything that would visually change the building inside or out. I doubt if I would be allowed to anyway. This development is totally hidden. It is under the lawn.’ Judd Architecture, the company that has drawn up the plans submitted to Camden planning officials, said: ‘The proposal… will have no impact at all on the listed building and minimal impact on the appearance of the garden.’","Debbie Dove is at loggerheads with her neighbours over the plans .

Courage: Lance Corporal James Ashworth is only the tenth British soldier to be awarded the Victoria Cross since the Second World War . The country’s highest award for gallantry is to be awarded to a British soldier who died protecting his comrades in Afghanistan. Lance Corporal James Ashworth is to be granted the Victoria Cross (VC) for an extraordinary act of heroism in Helmand Province last June. The 23-year-old soldier of the 1st Battalion The Grenadier Guards was looked up to by his fellow soldiers who have described him in eulogies as ‘loved by everyone’. He was serving with a reconnaissance platoon in the Nahr-e-Siraj district last summer, when his platoon became engaged in a battle with Taliban insurgents. He is understood to have fought with extraordinary courage against all odds until he was killed by a grenade. His acts, which involved deliberately exposing himself to enemy fire, saved his comrades’ lives. Officials said he had also taken care to ensure that there were no civilians in the line of fire, . James Ashworth, from Kettering, Northamptonshire, will become the tenth member of the British Army to be awarded the honour since the Second World War. His unit was left grief stricken by the loss of the soldier who had already acquired extensive combat experience during a previous tour of Afghanistan and had been promoted shortly before his death. In eulogies published by the MoD days after his death, Lance Corporal Ashworth’s comrades paid tribute to a soldier ‘bound for great things’ and whose courage ‘humbled’ those around him. Tribute: The repatriation ceremony for Lance Corporal James Ashworth after he died in Afghanistan last June . Valour: Colleagues said Lance Corporal James Ashworth showed extraordinary courage to protect his comrades during the firefight in Afghanistan (file photo) Captain Mike Dobbin, his company commander, said: ‘Lance Corporal Ashworth was killed while fighting his way through compounds; leading his fire team from the front, whilst trying to protect his men; and he showed extraordinary courage to close on a determined enemy.’ Guardsman Jordan Loftus said: ‘Selfless, brave, courageous — words like these don’t come close to what Ash demonstrated that day.’ His family paid to tribute to him after his death, saying: ‘We are devastated by the loss of our son, brother, uncle and boyfriend. He meant the world to everyone and has left an irreplaceable hole in our hearts.’ The Ashworth family has since raised money for the British Limbless Ex-Service Men’s Association by cycling from London to Edinburgh. The VC is awarded for valour ‘in the face of the enemy’ to members of the armed forces of various Commonwealth countries, and previous British Empire territories. It takes precedence over all other orders, decorations and medals. It was introduced on 29 January 1856 by Queen Victoria to honour acts of valour during the Crimean War. Unique: The Victoria Cross medal is cast from the metal of Russian guns captured during the Crimean War . The Victoria Cross ranks as the nation's highest award for gallantry, along with the George Cross. Instituted by Queen Victoria in 1856, the Victoria Cross is awarded for 'most conspicuous bravery, or some daring or pre-eminent act of valour or self-sacrifice, or extreme devotion to duty in the presence of the enemy.' The bronze cross, which has a crimson ribbon bears the inscription 'For Valour', is cast from the metal of Russian guns captured at the siege of Sevastopol during the Crimean War, the campaign in which the first medals were awarded. The Victoria Cross may be awarded to all ranks of the services - and also to civilians - to recognise gallantry in the presence of the enemy. The medal has been awarded 1,356 times, the most recent of which was a posthumous award to Corporal Bryan Budd, of the 3rd Battalion The Parachute Regiment, for acts of ""inspirational leadership and the greatest valour"" in southern Afghanistan in 2006. Only 13 Victoria Cross medals have been awarded since the Second World War, nine to members of the British Army and four to the Australian Army. L/Cpl Ashworth's is just the fifth to have been awarded since the Falklands conflict, and all but one have been posthumous. Private Johnson Beharry, from 1st Battalion the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment, was awarded the honour for two separate acts of outstanding gallantry to rescue his comrades in Iraq in 2004, during which suffered serious head injuries. The Victoria Cross has been awarded to the same person twice on three occasions - to doctors Captain Arthur Martin-Leake (1902 and 1914) and Captain Noel Chavasse (1916 and posthumously 1917), and New Zealander Captain Charles Upham (1941 and 1942). The George Cross, which stands equal to the Victoria Cross as an award, recognises acts of gallantry by members of the Armed Forces or civilians in situations for which the Victoria Cross is not appropriate. These can be incidents that are not in the presence of the enemy, such as bomb or mine disposal.","Lance Corporal James Ashworth given nation's highest honour for bravery .

Meanwhile, former Army Major Joyce, photographed being restrained by police on the ground, insisted he was not drunk when the brawl happened and he had not thrown any punches. In his first interview since Thursday night's incident, Joyce, 52, said he had had two glasses of wine, adding: 'There was no question of me being p****d.' But he freely admitted he struggled to control his temper. 'I'm quite aggressive when poked and I was poked,' he said. Joyce was arrested on suspicion of assault after he allegedly wrestled two officers to the ground and held one in a headlock at Westminster's Sports and Social Club bar. He was held in a London police station and released on Friday. He claimed the incident occurred when police wrongly accused him of starting a separate fracas at the  same bar. Joyce says the only injury was to a policeman who sustained a 'twisted finger' when he 'fell underneath' the MP. Scroll down for video .

And he is furious at a Commons drinks ban which means he cannot be served with alcohol at Parliament. He said Commons chiefs had 'confirmed to everyone that I had been p****d, which is disgraceful'.

'nothing to do with the business of me going out looking out for a . fight, pushing my way through crowds, getting p****d, that kind of . stuff.

A prison officer who sold information about James Bulger's . killer Jon Venables to The Sun has been jailed for 16 months, it can be reported for the first time today. Richard Trunkfield, . 31, from Moulton, Northamptonshire, admitted leaking information about the . child murderer while working at high security . Woodhill prison near Milton Keynes. Trunkfield told the paper Venables was being held in isolation and even about his eating habits, including the prisoner's love of burger and chips. He made £3,350 by fuelling five stories, including prison rumours that the child murderer's family were refusing to visit him behind bars. It . could not initially be reported that the inmate involved was Venables . because of legal restrictions on reporting his whereabouts. But the court heard today that Venables is no longer at Woodhill so the crime was made public. Jailed: Richard Trunkfield, a former prison officer at HMP Woodhill,  attempts to hide his face while arriving at the Old Bailey today, where he was jailed for selling details on killer Jon Venables . Details: The crime involving the sale of information on Jon Venables, shown aged 10, was kept secret as it revealed the jail he was in . Venables, now living under an assumed . identity, was convicted with Robert Thompson of killing toddler James . Bulger in 1993 when they were both 10. He was recalled to prison in 2010 after being suspected of child porn offences. Trunkfield pleaded guilty to misconduct in a public office between March 2 and April 30, 2010. Tragedy: James Bulger was murdered in 1993 aged two years old by Venables and accomplice Robert Thompson . New father Trunkfield had contact with a journalist at The Sun between 10 and 15 times and received £3,500 for information. He used it to pay off credit card debts, the court heard. The 31-year-old had also cared for his mother while she was suffering from cancer in 2008 and 2009. Jailing him the judge told him today: 'It's for those in authority to decide on the extent to which, if at all, it's in the public interest to reveal the details concerning a particular defendant, balancing a wide range of factors. 'It is most assuredly not for individual prison officers to take it upon themselves to contact the press to reveal information about a defendant in circumstances such as those before the court today, still less to enrich themselves in the process.' In mitigation, the court heard that Trunkfield had no direct contact with Venables and passed on minor details such as what he was eating. After he saw the stories that were being published, he assigned his journalist contact a different ringtone so he could ignore the calls, the court heard. It was also claimed that information was being leaked by another, unidentified source at the prison. He has also resigned his job and has nothing to do with the criminal. Gone: Venables is no longer at Woodhill Prison near Milton Keynes so the prison officer's crime can be published . Meanwhile a former police officer has been jailed for 10 months today for selling details of the arrests of footballer John Terry's mother and Rolling Stone Ronnie Wood to The Sun newspaper. Sold stories: Former Surrey PC Alan Tierney admitted two counts of misconduct in public office . Ex-Surrey Pc Alan Tierney was sentenced at the Old Bailey today after admitting two counts of misconduct in . public office for telling the paper that the former England . captain’s mother was held for shoplifting. Tierney also revealed the arrest of guitarist Wood for beating up his girlfriend for cash. Earlier this month he pleaded guilty to two counts - one between March 26 and April 3, 2009, and a second between December 2 and 7, 2009. He leaked details about Sue Terry and Sue Poole, the mother and mother-in-law of former England football captain John Terry, being arrested on suspicion of shoplifting in Surrey. He also sold details about the arrest of guitarist Ronnie Wood, 65, on suspicion of beating up his Russian lover Ekaterina Ivanova, who is in her 20s. Terry, Poole and Wood all accepted cautions over the matters. Passing sentence at the Old Bailey today, Mr Justice Fulford said that Tierney's offences were 'a disgraceful way for a police officer to act'. The judge said: 'It is wholly against the public interest for those who hold public office cynically to profit out of the misery or unfortunate circumstances of those for whom they are responsible.' The court heard that Tierney had sold the name and address of a witness to the Wood incident.Mr Justice Fulford said: “The most serious aspect of the two offences is that, in relation to count two, the defendant provided the name and, most significantly, the address of the witness. 'The fact that the individual coincidentally tried to sell the story to another newspaper is neither here nor there in terms of what this defendant had in mind. 'Put bluntly, it could easily have led to that witness withdrawing all co-operation as regards being a witness.' The court heard that Tierney was one of the officers sent to deal with Terry and Poole when they were stopped by store detectives at a Tesco in Weybridge, Surrey. After the Sun ran an exclusive story about the arrests, he contacted the tabloid from the email address guildford1@gmail.com, to correct the reported value of the goods involved, from £850 to £1,450. He was then contacted by journalists on the newspaper, and was offered a “donation” for a detailed account of what the women said and what they were accused of taking. Alan Tierney also sold information about the arrest of John Terry's mother and mother-in-law . Ex-Surrey police officer Alan Tierney admitted leaking a story that Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood, left, allegedly assaulted his then girlfriend Ekaterina Ivanova, right, in December 2009 . Tierney also tipped them off when civil legal action was started for compensation. He was paid with a cheque in his brother-in-law’s name. In relation to the second count, he was called to interview a witness to the incident involving Wood. Tierney contacted a journalist at the Sun, including making one of the calls while he was at a police station. He gave the name and address of the witness to the newspaper. In mitigation, the court heard that most of the details would have eventually become public, and that their leak had not undermined any investigation. The witness in the Terry case had also approached two other newspapers to try to sell his story. Defending, Bill Emlyn Jones said Tierney was 'an effective and well-regarded police officer' who was commended a number of times during his 11 years as a constable. He said: 'He has lost everything already. He has been dismissed from the job that he loved and he has therefore lost his income, his reputation, his family. His wife has separated from him and contact with his children has been extremely difficult. 'His fall from grace is complete already.' He said that Tierney was genuinely sorry and regretted what had happened.

A coroner yesterday attacked the box-ticking culture among GPs after hearing how a desperately ill baby was not seen quickly enough. Dr Shirley Radcliffe spoke out as she ruled that Axel Peanberg King died following ‘wholly inadequate’ decisions made by an out-of-hours doctor based on a one-minute phone call. Dr Muttu Shantikumar ignored the pleas from Linda Peanberg King for her seven-week-old son, who was suffering from pneumonia, to be seen as soon as possible, an inquest was told. Axel Peanburg King with his mother Linda. He died from pneumonia despite his mother calling and visiting a privately-run out of hours GP centre several times . He downgraded her call from ‘urgent’ to ‘routine’ and left her waiting for nearly four hours for an . appointment because he did not deem the baby’s situation an emergency. With her dying son in her arms, the . 35-year-old mother then had to wait in line behind six non-emergency . patients at the private out-of-hours GP service Harmoni, at Whittington . Hospital in Archway, north London. St Pancras Coroner’s Court heard that . it was only when an off-duty nurse spotted that Axel had turned ‘grey . and floppy’ that he received emergency care – but by then it was too . late and he died at the hospital from bronchopneumonia five days after . falling ill. Recording a narrative verdict, Dr Radcliffe described the . brief phone conversation between Dr Shantikumar and Mrs Peanberg King as . ‘wholly inadequate’, adding that the doctor ‘asked insufficient . questions’. She said: ‘It lasted only one minute and the entries made are clearly at odds with the evidence from Mrs Peanberg King.’ Mrs Peanburg King told the inquest that when she arrived at the private GP clinic with Axel, who was no longer breathing, she was told by a receptionist to 'wait in line' Axel’s mother said that after she . spoke to Dr Shantikumar at 12.45pm on November 3 last year, he made them . an appointment for 4pm, but when they arrived they had to queue to be . seen. By this time Axel had become unresponsive and he went into cardiac . arrest. Mrs Peanberg King, of Islington, north London, said that on . October 31 she took Axel to her own GP, who diagnosed him with a viral . infection. The next day, when his condition had not improved, she took him to the Harmoni centre. She saw Dr Kuljeet Takhar, who told . her Axel’s lungs were clear and gave them a prescription for antibiotics . so they would not have to go back if the baby’s condition changed. The coroner described Harmoni’s . medical services as ‘robust’, adding ‘call backs and consultations up . until 3 November were admitted appropriately’. She added: ‘It is . impossible to say whether intervention at an earlier stage would have . changed the tragic outcome.’ Seven-week old Axel was treated at the Harmoni centre at the Whittington Hospital in north London (pictured) before he died . Mrs Peanberg King had said earlier in . the inquest that she believed her previous visit to Dr Takhar had been . insufficient. But Dr Radcliffe said she was satisfied that his . consultation was carried out in an appropriate manner. During the inquest, the coroner said . GPs were obliged to practise ‘defensive medicine’ where the focus is on . writing lengthy notes rather than on ‘spending time assessing . individuals and communicating with the family’. She said: ‘We live in an . age where there is an assumption that if it isn’t written down, it . isn’t done, so we can have a situation where doctors do very little in . their consultation but have perfect records.’ On the other hand, she added: ‘We can . have perfectly good consultations with doctors that cover the ground but . are no good on paper simply because they have not ticked every box, . which is worrying.’ Axel’s death is the latest controversy . involving Harmoni – the largest private provider of NHS out-of-hours GP . services in the country which is responsible for the care of eight . million patients. Last year there were allegations that . the service is so short-staffed it is regularly unsafe – and that . managers were regularly sending out ‘mayday’ text messages requiring . urgent cover for shifts where there was no one on duty. After the inquest, Mrs Peanberg King . and her husband, Alistair, 36, a media manager, said: ‘We believe there . are still many questions to answer about the safety of the service . provided by Harmoni. ‘We do not believe that anyone hearing . all the evidence in this case could have full confidence in Harmoni’s . out-of-hours services. We are now considering all our options to prevent . any other children from falling through the net.’","Dr Shirley Radcliffe said GPs were obliged to practice 'defensive medicine'

Researchers revealed the astonishing find in a new research paper analysing the animals at the Tangalooma Island Resort in Australia. On 23 occasions over the past several years, wild dolphins were observed . giving gifts to humans, including eels, tuna, squid, and even an octopus. Scroll down for video . Tourists at the resort playing with the Dolphins. Researchers found 23 occurences of dolphins giving humans gifts including fins and even an octopus . 'Gift giving has become an established but infrequent part of the culture of the provisioned dolphins at Tangalooma,' the researchers say in a paper pushed in . the journal Anthrozoös: A Multidisciplinary Journal of the Interactions . of People & Animals. The wild dolphins that were observed giving gifts to human in Australia . were regular visitors to a provisioning program at the Tangalooma Island . Resort which began in 1992. Each evening . staff members from the resort wade into the ocean to feed the wild . dolphins fish. In 1998, an adult male dolphin named Fred was observed giving a dead . moray eel to one of the staff members. Since then, staff members have . documented an additional 22 other events. 'Since July 1998, biologists managing the program have documented 23 occurrences of 'giftgiving,' when several of the provisioned dolphins have offered wild-caught cephalopod or fin fish species to staff members,' the researchers wrote. Fred, the first dolphin recorded giving gifts to a human at the resort . Tinkerbell and Storm, two of the dolphins found to be bringing gifts to human handlers at the resort . Dolphins of a wide group of ages and both sexes engaged in the gift-giving . behavior, and scientists are not entirely sure of what is motivating . their behavior. Food sharing in animals is often motivated by an urge to . play, a desire to reciprocate food sharing or the belief that the . recipient of the food is an incompetent hunter, they claim. Based on their detailed . observations, the scientists think that gift giving among the wild . dolphins at the Tangalooma Island Resort was likely a form of play . behavior. 'Gift giving may occur either as a discreet behavior (that may be a sequel to one or more other behaviors such as play or food preparation), or as a part of other behaviors, such as play and/or food sharing,' the team, Bonnie Holmes and David Neil of the University of Queensland in Brisbane, said. 'It is most likely a  manifestation of the particular relationship between the provisioned dolphinsand the human participants in the provisioning. 'Gift giving has become an established but infrequent part of the culture of the provisioned dolphins at Tangalooma.' The resort is well known for its dolphin encounters, where the wild animals come to the beach.","Wild dolphins in the Tangalooma Island Resort in Australia were spotted gift giving 23 times .

There are more allegations of sexual abuse at the music school attended by Frances Andrede, who was abused there as a teenager and killed herself after giving evidence against former tutor Michael Brewer . Sexual abuse at the music school attended by Frances Andrade dates back more than four decades, ex-pupils claim. Mrs Andrade, 48, killed herself after cross-examination during the trial of choirmaster Michael Brewer, who assaulted her while she was at Chetham’s. Since his conviction last  week, other former pupils have come forward with allegations that the abuse began even earlier. One, a mother in her 50s, claims she was sexually abused by eminent Chopin specialist Ryszard Bakst for five years. She claimed she told her housemistress about the abuse in 1972, but no action was taken. Mr Bakst, who died in 1999  at the age of 72, is the third named teacher to  be accused of preying on young female pupils at the exclusive Manchester school. He tutored there until the 1990s. Police are now investigating claims that sexual abuse at Chetham’s was ‘rife’ in the late 1970s and 80s. Yesterday the former pupil described Mr Bakst, who gave her piano lessons, as a ‘beast’. She said: ‘I reported it [the abuse] back in 1972, and all that happened was that we were told pupils shouldn’t be going to teachers’ houses.’ She added: ‘I must have been the first girl he abused after starting at Chetham’s – I was only 16. It went on for five years, first at Chetham’s and then at the Royal Northern College of Music. ‘The whole time I was having to fend him off, but I had to get through my degree so I had to put up with him. ‘One time he invited my parents to tea and tried to sexually abuse me while I was upstairs. ‘We were all a bit scared of “the great Professor Bakst” I think – even the staff were in awe of him. I’d be shivering in my shoes waiting for him to come in. ‘It’s too late for him to face justice now but hopefully other teachers who were abusing pupils at Chetham’s will be put behind bars now along with Brewer.’ She is due to speak to detectives in Manchester next week. Brewer was found guilty and is awaiting sentencing. His former wife also took part in the abuse . Another former pupil described how Mr Bakst took her hand from the keyboard while giving her a one-to-one lesson and touched himself intimately with it. One of Mr Bakst’s most successful former pupils, pianist Andrew Wilde, told the Daily Mail: ‘Bakst was a wonderful musician and a mentor and father figure to me. ‘I’m appalled to hear of what  he was doing to girls at  Chetham’s and even more horrified that it was apparently covered up. ‘This is a terrible time for everyone who cares about the school and it’s vital that it’s properly investigated now.’ Former pupils say sexual abuse at Chetham's School of Music dates back 40 years . Mr Bakst fled to Britain in 1968 after facing pressure from the Communist authorities in his native Poland. He taught a generation of pianists at Chetham’s. Chetham’s has said it destroys records of staff seven years after they leave but is helping police with their inquiries. The Royal Northern College of Music, where Mr Bakst also tutored, declined to comment. Next month it will award a prize named in his honour. Greater Manchester Police are also investigating claims made by former Chetham’s  students that  they were sexually abused by Chris Ling, a violin teacher now working as a classical music agent in California. At the weekend he told a reporter he had no comment to make on the allegations. At least one of the former pupils who has directly contacted police is understood to have made allegations against a fourth teacher, who has not yet been named. A spokesman for the force said: ‘We will be working very closely with the school in the coming weeks and months but this investigation is at a very early stage.’ Brewer, 68, was last week acquitted of raping Mrs Andrade when she was 18 in 1983 but convicted of five counts of indecently assaulting her when she was under 16. At his trial he had admitted having an affair with a 17-year-old pupil when she was head girl in 1994. His ex-wife Kay, also 68, was acquitted of aiding and abetting rape but convicted of one count of indecent assault. They will be sentenced later.","Three teachers named as abusers at Chetham's, where Frances Andrade was assaulted .

"By . James Tozer . PUBLISHED: . 11:46 EST, 19 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:14 EST, 22 March 2013 . A schoolgirl hanged herself after her father insisted she let him check her mobile phone for abusive messages, an inquest heard yesterday. David Stringer said he found his daughter Jade, 14, hanged when he went to look in on her about half an hour after she began ‘sulking’ in her bedroom. He cut her down and she was taken to hospital in a critical condition, but died six days later. Tragic: Jade Stringer, 14, of Bury, Greater Manchester, was unhappy at being told to hand over the phone . The inquest heard that Jade’s parents, who are separated, had been worried she was receiving abusive text messages from a boy she had accused of hitting her. Jade’s mother, Natalie Ingoe, 32, told the hearing that her daughter, who had done well at school, started wearing make-up and wanting to go out at night around the age of 12 or 13. ‘I suppose the normal teenage things,’ she added. But in March 2011, Mr Stringer, 32, and Mrs Ingoe discovered that she was sleeping with a boyfriend and spoke to his parents to make sure they were never left unsupervised. Then in November of that year Jade took an overdose and had to be kept in hospital overnight. ‘There was no indication why she did it – I thought at the time it was boys,’ said Mrs Ingoe. The inquest in Rochdale was told  that Jade and her mother used  to share a mobile phone, and at Christmas that year she had allowed Mrs Ingoe to look at her text messages. ‘Some of them were from boys saying that she was going with lads,’ she said. ‘She just said it was lads making it up.’ Mrs Ingoe said friends of her daughter later told her ‘there were pictures going around of Jade’. ‘There had been a couple of incidents, and Jade had been at a party and had slept with someone and it had caused trouble with her boyfriend at the time,’ she added. In attendance: Jade’s father David Stringer (left), 32, and mother Natalie Ingoe (right), 32, were at the inquest . But she said that when she and Mr Stringer talked to her about it, she ‘didn’t think there was anything wrong with it’. Jade ran away from the home she shared with her father in Bury, Greater Manchester, on a couple of occasions but seemed more ‘settled’ in 2012, her mother added. However, last summer she accused a boy of assaulting her, and her mobile phone was seized by police in an attempt to stop him contacting her. Mr Stringer said that when it was returned last June, he and Jade’s mother told her that ‘she could have her phone back on the condition that we could check it to see that the lad hadn’t sent her any abusive messages’. He added: ‘I asked her for the charger but she was in a sulk and said she didn’t want me to switch it on. ‘It was a stand-off and she was sulking in her bedroom. I left her to cool off and later went upstairs to see if she was still sulking, and that’s when I found her.’ Education: The teenager, who lived with her father at the time of her death, excelled as a Haslingden High School (pictured) pupil, performing as a cheerleader and as speaker for the school book club . Jade died at Manchester Children’s Hospital on June 16 with her family by her side. Mr Stringer told the inquest  that until then he had regarded  his daughter as ‘behaving like a normal teenager’. Recording a verdict of death by misadventure, assistant deputy coroner Lisa Hashmi said there had been no major cause for concern before the ‘disagreement’ over the mobile phone. She said she could not be sure that Jade’s actions weren’t ‘simply another cry for help or call for attention’, and concluded: ‘I cannot be satisfied that she intended to take her own life.’","Jade Stringer, of Bury, was unhappy at being told to hand over the phone .

A woman who lost her home and business when she split from her partner of more than three decades is a victim of sexist property laws, a top judge said yesterday. Pamela Curran, 55, had worked with Brian Collins, 52, at his kennels and cattery. But after their relationship ended in 2010, a county court judge ruled that she had no right to a share in the business, or the home where they had lived together. Pamela Curran, 55, was left penniless when her 30 year relationship with Brian Collins, 52, ended but has been given the right to appeal a ruling that said she had no right to share the business or the home where they lived . Miss Curran was left penniless, with her belongings placed in storage while she stayed with any friends who could take her in. But she is now able to appeal the . ruling after judge Lord Justice Toulson said she is a victim of unfair . and old-fashioned property laws that are biased against women of her age . and position. ‘Sadly, the appellant found herself in . the classic position of a woman jilted in her early fifties, having . very much made her life with the respondent for over 30 years. The law . of property can be harsh on people, usually women, in that situation,’ he said. ‘Bluntly, the law remains unfair to . people in the appellant’s position, but the judge was constrained to . apply the law as it is.’ The Court of Appeal heard that the couple began . their relationship as teenagers in the Seventies, and remained ‘an . item’ until their split three years ago. They lived and worked together at . Haven Boarding Kennels and Cattery near Ashford, Kent, which was bought . in Mr Collins’s name in 2007. Workplace: The couple lived and worked together at The Haven, a kennels and cattery business near Ashford, Kent which was bought in 52-year-old Mr Collins's sole name in 2007 . Miss Curran said she had ‘trusted’ in . her partner that, if they ever split up, she would be given a ‘fair . share’ of the property and business, bought for a total of £750,000. However, when the case reached the Central London County Court last May, . Judge Hazel Marshall concluded that the couple had not established a . business partnership. Miss Curran told Lord Justice Toulson . yesterday that she had put a lot of hard work into making the business . successful, but was left with nothing to show for it. 'Sadly, the appellant found herself in the classic position of a woman jilted in her early 50s, having very much made her life with the respondent for over 30 years.The law of property can be harsh on people, usually women, in that situation. Bluntly, the law remains unfair to people in the appellant’s position, but the judge was constrained to apply the law as it is' Lord Justice Toulson . ‘I was absolutely stripped of . everything,’ she said, sobbing in court. ‘The person you see sitting . here today is not the person I was, because I have been destroyed.’ Lord Justice Toulson said judges . ‘ought not to be affected by human sympathies; they must apply the law . as they see it’. However, he added: ‘It was extremely difficult not to . be affected by a sense that the appellant has, in truth, been treated . unfairly. ‘She describes herself as a nobody, . but with a profound sense that what’s happened was not just. She says . she worked really hard at the kennels and got nothing for it.’ He added that, given Judge Marshall . said she believed Miss Curran was essentially a truthful witness – and . that Mr Collins himself had at times suggested to third parties that the . business had truly been a partnership – Miss Curran should have . permission to bring a full appeal against the initial decision. Mr Collins was neither present, nor represented at the hearing. A report published by the Law . Commission in 2007 had recommended that property laws be reformed as . they were unfair to those in Miss Curran’s position. The body wanted to . give those in cohabiting relationships the same rights as married . couples in order to ‘reflect the growing prevalence and public . acceptance of cohabitation’. However, the Government announced in 2011 that it had no plans to change the law.","Pamela Curran had been with partner Brian Collins, 52, since late 1970s .

Nurse Edith Appleton granted Private Charles Kerr his last wish of a kiss, before he died at the age of 21 . Dying after being gassed in the trenches of the Western Front, young Private Charles Kerr’s last wish was a kiss from his nurse. Touchingly, Sister Edith Appleton obliged with two – a kiss from her, and one on behalf of his mother back home in Britain. Later that day Private Kerr, aged just 21, breathed his last, with Sister Appleton – then aged 38 – recording his poignant death in her harrowing but moving diaries, which have now been published as a book. As a result, relatives of Private Kerr have been able to meet the descendants of Sister Appleton and finally give recognition to her extraordinary act of compassion 97 years ago today. Previously a clerk at a cotton warehouse, Private Kerr joined the 2nd Manchester Pals and was sent to northern France in November 1915. But four months later he was suffering from pneumonia after apparently being gassed in the trenches and moved to a field hospital near Le Havre. There he was cared for by Sister Appleton, known as Edie, a nurse from Deal in Kent, who signed up for military service soon after the war broke out. In her diaries, she wrote of how ‘my poor little boy Kerr’ had spent 15 days ‘extremely and dangerously ill’ before it finally became clear he wouldn’t recover. Her notes described March 12, 1916 as ‘a difficult day to be “Sister”’, with Private Kerr whispering messages for his fiancee and begging: ‘When I’m gone, will you kiss me?’ Despite the many injured soldiers beseeching her attention, she recorded: ‘I did kiss the boy – first for his mother and then for myself – which pleased him.’ After he died, she ensured he was ‘decently put in the mortuary’, subsequently returning to plant primroses at his grave. The exchange between Sister Edith Appleton and Private Charles Kerr was revealed in her war diaries she kept . Charles Kerr is pictured with the 17th Service Battalion Manchester Regiment but relatives don't know which one is him . More than 90 years later, her great-nephew Dick Robinson had the diaries edited and published as War Diaries – A Nurse At The Front, before setting out to contact relatives of her patients. Among them was Private Kerr’s great-great-niece Nicola Mortimer who found the diary entry online while researching her family’s history. The pair met at the Imperial War Museum North in Manchester where Mr Robinson was giving a talk about the book. Mrs Mortimer, 42, a mother of two from Bury, said reading about the care Private Kerr received had been an intensely moving experience. ‘Sister Edith seems like an angel to me,’ she said. ‘She never left his side and she even wrote to his mother.’ The only photograph she has is of Private Kerr’s platoon, and she does not know which is him. ‘It was a godsend to find that Charles was named in the book,’ she added. ‘Until then, I never knew he had a fiancee waiting for him back home.’ Self portrait: Edith Appleton's diaries were often humorous and an illustration shows her uniform being blown up revealing stripy pyjamas underneath . Mr Robinson has met two other relatives of those Sister Appleton cared for or worked with. He has listed all their names on – www.edithappleton.org.uk – in the hope of tracking more down. ‘Meeting relatives of soldiers like Charles is the most rewarding aspect of having brought Edie’s diaries to life,’ he said. Sister Appleton was awarded a military OBE for her work with the Queen Alexandra’s Imperial Military Nursing Service Reserve. She died in 1958. Private Kerr’s body still lies in Etretat cemetery, in northern France. The Imperial War Museum North is hosting an exhibition called Saving Lives about battlefield medicine and care, which runs until September. Reunited by history: Dick Robinson (the great nephew of Edith Appleton) and wife Lisa and Nicola Mortimer and Marilyn Wilcox (descendants of Charles Kerr) met at the Imperial War Museum North, Salford . March 6, 1916: Busy day – poor Kerr (pneumonia etc, etc). I am afraid will not weather the storm... March 8: I am writing to his mother and telling her so, she is evidently . a refined old lady – writes back to say she is ‘so glad to hear Charlie . is with us – the rest and good food will do him good’. Have my letters not reached her? Or won’t she understand that the boy is dying. March 10: The day was very busy and poor Kerr worse – I am sure that boy has been gassed & will die. Shouldn’t be surprised to find his cot empty when I go on duty. Poor mother – how will she take it? March 12: Too much sadness to write about, besides being dead beat. March 13: My poor little boy Kerr died yesterday. He had been in 15 days suffering from gas, pneumonia, bronchitis and has . been extremely and dangerously ill all the time, but only the day . before yesterday he realised that he was not going to get well. I am glad to say we never left him night or day and he was fond of us . all. Yesterday was a difficult day to be ‘Sister’. He kept whispering . all sorts of messages for home and his fiancee. Then he would call ‘Sister’ and when I bent down to hear – ‘I do love you. When I’m gone, will you kiss me?’. All the time heads would be popping in ‘Sister this and Sister that’.

A Florida woman who killed a teenage girl in a hit-and-run incident in March has been found dead in an apparent suicide. Danielle Halverson, 50, of DeLand, was charged with leaving the scene of a crash involving death after she lost control of her vehicle while reaching for her cell phone and fatally struck 14-year-old Juliana Hobbs. On Monday morning, Ms Halverson's body was found in her South Ridgewood Avenue home. She is understood to have died of an overdose. A friend of the woman had called the Volusia County Sheriff's Department requesting a welfare check after struggling to contact her. He told police she'd seemed increasingly depressed lately and had made statements suggesting she was considering suicide. Deputies and paramedics arrived at the scene and found Ms Halverson in her bedroom, unresponsive and without a pulse. Paramedics began CPR and the woman was transported by ambulance to Florida Hospital-DeLand, where she was pronounced dead at 11:39 am, according to the Daytona Beach News Journal. Sheriff's spokesman Gary Davidson said the death was being treated as a suicide as there was a lack of injury and the woman left a note, however he didn't reveal whether it referred to the March incident. Ms Halverson had told Florida Highway Patrol she'd struck Ms Hobbs with her 2004 Toyota Corolla after losing control of her car while reaching for her cellphone. According to her arrest report, she told police: 'I kind of feel stupid for saying this, but a cellphone was a little bit a part of it, trying to reach for it. I was the sole driver of the car. Yes, I'll admit that.' The crash took place at around 8.40pm on March 17. Ms Hobbs' friend Rachel Russell, 14, was also injured but not seriously. Hit-and-run: Juliana Hobbs, 14, pictured, was killed in the hit-and-run in March . Depressed: Ms Halverson had been charged with leaving a crash site and tampering with evidence after the fatal collision that killed Ms Hobbs, pictured left and right . Police located Ms Halverson's car just days after the collision. On it they found DNA linking the vehicle to the crash, including Ms Hobbs' blood on the front bumper and Ms Hobbs' and Ms Russell's DNA on a portion of the windshield. The woman was listed as a person of interest but wasn't arrested until October 16. In addition to the hit-and-run charges, Ms Halverson had been charged with tampering with evidence. Her boyfriend, James Hanna, 59, was charged with accessory after the fact, tampering or fabricating evidence and making fake reports to authorities earlier this month after allegedly lying to police about his girlfriend's whereabouts on the day of the crash. On November 9, Ms Halverson was . rearrested after failing to show up in court to have the hit-and-run . charges read to her, according to court records. DeLand police had to go to her South . Ridgewood Avenue home and take her into custody after she did not show . up for her arraignment the previous day. Overdose: Police were called to Ms Halverson's home after a friend became worried about her welfare . A DeLand resident called 911 after Ms Halverson's Corolla hit the two girls and then sped off. Elizabeth Hoefler, who lives two doors . away from where the teens were struck, said her 18-year-old daughter . made one of the frantic calls for help and tried to resuscitate Juliana Hobbs. Ms Hoefler had had pizza delivered to her family the night the incident happened and was at home when she heard the collision, she told the West Volusia Beacon. 'I heard this car, and it did a total acceleration. Then, bam! There were no brakes, no screeching,' she said, adding that she initially thought a motorist had struck the family's mailbox. '(My husband) ran out and said it wasn't our mailbox.' Ms Hoefler said a pickup truck with two men had stopped in the road and were yelling 'Stop! Stop!' She said she saw a silhouette and thought it might have been a dog, then she saw the outline of Juliana's tennis shoe. 'I went running up there. I could see Rachel. She was screaming 'They hit us! They aimed for us!'' Ms Hoefler said she held Rachel while her husband and daughter tried to perform CPR on Juliana. 'Juliana never moved,' said Ms Hoefler, who left to get Rachel's father, just three houses away. 'There was absolutely no screeching of tires, no brakes, just a total acceleration,' she added. Ms Hobbs' sister described Ms Halverson's death as a tragic overdose. 'I was told it was an overdose of some sorts,' Courtney Meyer told the News Journal. 'I just feel numb right now. It's just a sad ending to a sad story.'","Danielle Halverson, 50, was found dead in her DeLand, Florida, home on Monday morning .

Health campaigners stormed out of a meeting of NHS bosses today after under fire chief executive Sir David Nicholson was given a vote of confidence by his board. A member of the public shouted 'shameful' as Professor Malcolm Grant, chairman of the NHS Commissioning Board, said Sir David was the person 'we wish very strongly' to lead the organisation. Sir David has faced calls to quit following the publication of the Francis Report into serious failings at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust between 2005 and 2009. Anger: Health campaigners stormed out of a meeting of NHS bosses today as under fire chief executive Sir David Nicholson was given a vote of confidence by his board . The stormy meeting came after it emerged today that the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust may be placed into administration by health bosses. Regulator Monitor said it was considering the move in order to 'safeguard services' for local patients. If the move goes ahead, the trust will be the first foundation trust in the country to be put under the charge of special administrators. The . families of patients caught up in the Stafford Hospital scandal staged a . protest outside the meeting of NHS bosses today and renewed their calls for the . resignation of Sir David. The campaigners . stood in silence outside the meeting in Manchester of the NHS . Commissioning Board (NHS CB), which Sir David heads. Around a dozen . people, who had travelled from Staffordshire, held placards displaying . Sir David’s photograph accompanied by the words 'Resign', 'The man with . no shame' and 'Too many deaths, no accountability'. Leading . the protest outside was Julie Bailey, who set up the organisation Cure . The NHS after her mother, Bella, died at Stafford Hospital in 2007. Pressure: The silent protest was held outside NHS offices in Manchester against Sir David Nicholson . Speaking outside the meeting, Mrs Bailey said the families 'simply want a safer NHS'. She . added: 'We campaigned for three years for a public inquiry in the hope . that at the end of it we would get accountability and justice for all . the loved ones that we have lost. 'We want accountability and safety for everyone in the NHS and we believe that won’t happen until people are held to account.' She . said Sir David was 'not a scapegoat', adding: 'He is the chief . executive of the NHS and holds ultimate responsibility for the failings. 'He . is paid an awful amount of money to ensure people are safe in hospital. It’s not a difficult thing to do but he seems to have taken the eye off . safety and prioritised finances instead. 'We believe that, as he is ultimately responsible for the NHS, he should do the honourable thing and resign immediately. 'It’s disappointing that we’re having to be here, after all this time, trying to hold people to account and get justice.' She . said her message to the NHS board today was: 'How can we start to cure . the NHS when the person who was in charge of those failings is now . expected to be in charge of putting it right?' But speaking at the meeting, Sir . David defended his position. He said: 'The enemy is complacency that . things will be all right in the face of . criticism of NHS services. 'What we need to do is absorb the criticism, . understand it in a deep way and do something about it. 'I'm very passionate about improving services for patients, I'm very . ambitious about the NHS and what that sometimes turns into is . intolerance of poor performance which results in the kind of response ""Just get it right"" when actually we need to be more reflective, think . about why people are doing the things they do.' He said it was important that standards are set in a way patients can understand and help enforce. 'If we had hundreds of thousands of inspectors going round hospitals . looking at that, we wouldn't pick up all the poor care that happens. 'Patient safety is the top of the tree. We need zero tolerance of failures of patient safety.' At the meeting, Prof Grant said he had been 'deeply worried' by speculation in the media about Sir David's future. Controversy: Sir David has faced calls to quit following the publication of the Francis Report into serious failings at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust between 2005 and 2009 . He added: 'Over the recent weeks I have reflected on several occasions with David about what has been said in the press. 'I . have discussed it personally with each of the directors of the . Commissioning Board and I have discussed it collectively with the . non-executive directors of the board. 'We have come to a clear view . that David Nicholson is the chief executive of the board, he is the . person who we wish very strongly to lead a strong executive team on the . board. 'He is the person whose command of the detail of the NHS, and . his commitment and his passion to its future, we believe to be . fundamental to the success of the board.' The chairman said his . statement was a 'statement of strength' and added: 'We look, David, to . you to provide us with the leadership as we take through an . exceptionally challenging set of changes.' Robin Bastin, of the campaign group Cure the NHS, was one of those who walked out of the meeting. Speaking . afterwards, he said: 'It's outrageous for him (Sir David) to say he . needed to go on running this when he has been responsible for all that . has happened. 'He was in charge of the strategic health authority when all this was going on. I'm disgusted.' The NHS trust at the centre of the Stafford Hospital scandal could become the first foundation trust in the country to be put into administration, it emerged today. Regulator Monitor said it was considering the move in order to 'safeguard services' for local patients . Last year, South London Healthcare . NHS Trust (SLHT) became the first ever NHS trust to be put into . administration after it started losing around £1.3 million a week. Worrying: The NHS trust at the centre of the Stafford Hospital scandal could become the first foundation trust in the country to be put into administration. Stafford General Hospital is pictured . But now Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust  could be the first foundation trust - a supposed marker of . excellence in the health service - to face the same fate. Monitor, the watchdog which regulates foundation trusts, said it was consulting the Health Secretary and key organisations about the prospective appointment of trust special administrators. An independent review into the trust, conducted on behalf of Monitor, concluded that the organisation was neither clinically nor financially sustainable in its current form. Monitor said that if administrators are appointed, they will devise a plan for the reorganisation and delivery of services. A spokesman said the plan would be subject to public consultation. David Bennett, chief executive of Monitor, said: 'We are now consulting on whether to appoint trust special administrators with the expertise to reorganise services in a way which is clinically robust and sustainable. Campaigner: Julie Bailey, founder of 'Cure the NHS' campaign, was leading the protest outside . 'Their priority will be to make sure that patients can continue to access the services that they need and they will work with the local community to do this. 'Taking into account the consultation process, it would be several weeks before trust special administrators were in place. In the meantime, the trust board will continue to ensure the current range of services are delivered for patients and trust special administrators would then continue that responsibility.' Yesterday it was revealed that death rates at another hospital are being investigated following the discovery that an 'unusually high number' of deaths were 'coded' as due to septicaemia. Bolton NHS Foundation Trust’s acting chief executive, Dr Jackie Bene, has stepped aside pending the inquiry. Septicaemia, a severe infection which enters the bloodstream, is coded, or tagged, in a different way from other illnesses and infections, which means deaths caused by septicaemia do not affect hospital mortality figures. In the wake of the findings, NHS . medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh called on all hospitals to . 'behave openly and honestly about their performance' and said they would . be 'monitoring the situation'. According . to a report in the Bolton News, the trust recorded 800 cases of . septicaemia between March 2011 and April 2012 - a similar sized trust . would expect to have just 200. Dr Bene, as former medical director, was in charge of recording the information. The independent watchdog which is auditing the data is understood to be investigating 200 cases, the Bolton News reported. Its interim findings for 50 of the cases show 'cause for concern'. In a statement, the trust said: 'While this work is taking place, Dr Jackie Bene, who as a trust consultant and medical director oversaw coding, has agreed to step aside as acting chief executive, to allow a fully independent view to be taken. 'We do not believe that there are any clinical concerns regarding the care of patients, but rather there are questions that need answering about how the trust reports information about their care for administrative and financial purposes.'","Board said Sir David was the person 'we wish very strongly' to lead the NHS .

When they moved into their purpose-built £50million offices, the council staff of Rochdale had high hopes for the lavatories. Instead, the new facilities caused a revolt – because they are unisex. Some workers at the new headquarters were aggrieved at the idea of men and women using the same cubicles. Now, the gender ratio on each floor of the building will be analysed before individual toilets are allocated proportionately as either male or female. Flashy: But Rochdale council's new building is only equipped with unisex bathrooms, leading to staff anger . It all adds up to the town’s biggest . toilet fiasco since its shopping mall introduced squat loos in the name . of cultural sensitivity three years ago. The new offices, named Number One Riverside, were built to accommodate 2,000 council staff. Boss: Rochdale council's new building was overseen by chief executive Jim Taylor . However, the first batch of workers to transfer to the new building were shocked to find it lacked  separate toilet facilities. Helen Harrison, Unison’s Rochdale branch secretary, said council staff have raised concerns. ‘People do have different views on it but there are a number of people who are upset about the unisex issue,’ she said. ‘I think what the council is looking at doing now is tallying up the . ratio of male and female workers on each floor and will split up the . toilets that way.’ Each floor of the building has around eight toilet . cubicles opening off a corridor, all currently with male and female . symbols on the door. 'They are fully enclosed with their own washing and drying facilities, rather than communal ones. Nevertheless some staff have apparently baulked at the idea of using cubicles frequented by members of the opposite sex. Last night Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, . said: ‘It’s bizarre that council bosses pressed ahead with unisex loos . despite a clear lack of demand for them. ‘This is a perfect example of politically correct thinking trumping common sense at the expense of everyone else.’ Unisex toilets first entered the public consciousness in the 1990s . American TV series Ally McBeal where they were the setting for gossip . and romantic encounters between her lawyer colleagues. As a compromise, cubicles at Rochdale council’s building will now be allocated as male or female. Operational services director Mark Widdup said: ‘The building was . intended to have unisex toilets on the office floors, as is the norm in . many modern buildings. Controversy: The building was only equipped with unisex toilets rather than men's and women's . ‘However, based on staff feedback who have been based in the building . for several weeks and discussions with the unions, we’ve decided to . review these facilities.’ The building also houses the town’s new library and has space for . private firms. The council says it will save £1million a year by having . workers in one modern location as well as giving a better service to . local people. In 2010 there was amazement when Rochdale’s Exchange mall installed two . squat toilets after bosses were told some of the town’s Asian and . Eastern European communities preferred them. Rochdale is far from the only council to have wasted taxpayers' money on perks which turned out to be useless. Last month, Banbury council came under fire for spending £10,000 on a replica of the mayor's ceremonial gold chain. Eight . months ago, Crawley council in Sussex paid £630 to translate its . newsletter into Urdu for the benefit of just one resident who complained . about not understanding the promotional document. And . in 2011, workers at Ashford council were treated to a day out at a . high-wire adventure course, with taxpayers shouldering the £750 bill .","Employees have just started working at modern complex in Rochdale .

When a married woman came to believe her husband was having an affair with a college lecturer, she tried to vent her fury in an email to the suspected lover. But after Donna Lees failed to receive any reply, she decided to communicate her anger to everyone who shared Claire Russell’s surname at Bath University. As a result, intimate details of the alleged affair between law tutor Miss Russell and father-of-two Sean Lees have been widely circulated to hundreds of people – and caused much amusement for the university’s students. Rivals:  Donna Lees, left, emailed her husband's suspected lover Claire Russell, right, but when she did not receive a reply she sent an email to everyone sharing lecturer's surname at Bath University . Mrs Lees’s email, which was sent on Wednesday, reads: ‘Clearly you are equally as dishonest as my husband, given he has admitted today that he has been sleeping with you since September. ‘Has Sean told you that he left his SatNav in our youngest daughter’s car whilst I was on holiday two weeks ago? ‘It has all the dates and times of his meetings with you.’ Mrs Lees, who runs a Brighton-based fish supply business with her 49-year-old husband – from whom she has now separated – said she attempted to contact Miss Russell via what she believed was her personal email address. But when she did not reply, Mrs Lees decided she ‘would not just sit back and be ignored’. Mrs Lees had wanted to send a message to Miss Russell’s college email address, but because she didn’t know which exact address was hers, she sent it to everyone with the surname Russell. It is thought that Mrs Lees obtained the emails of all staff and students named Russell from the university website. Revealing: The email has caused quite a commotion among students at Bath University, pictured . The email was initially addressed to 15 people with the surname. It is believed to have since been circulated hundreds of times since. In it, Mrs Lees says: ‘Perhaps you just like secretly s******g other people’s husbands?, in between your demanding work and family schedule. ‘To be the catalyst that smashes apart a whole family and destroys the trust and love between a father and two daughters must surely be a big burden to bear Claire... ‘Well done. I hope your conscience copes, although given it appears to match your morals it probably will.’ Mrs Lees and her husband have two daughters, Brooke, 20, and Paige, 18, and have been married for 23 years. She said: ‘We were a very close family before all this happened, including him, but I just hope he can re-build a relationship with his daughters in the future.’ Mrs Lees, 45 added that her husband had admitted the affair ‘to my daughter, then admitted it to me as well’. She said that her husband and Miss Russell dated ‘but only for a few months’. Regarding the email being widely read, Mrs Lees said: ‘I don’t really care if she’s embarrassed – that’s not my problem, if she replied in the first place I wouldn’t have resorted to doing that. ‘I have never met Claire but know of her through friends of friends,’ she added. Miss Russell, who works part-time at Bath, one of the UK’s top ten universities, alongside her role as a consultant at Bespoke Legal Practice, declined to comment on the alleged affair or email. She said: ‘I do not know Donna Lees and have never met her. ‘I understand from many who do know her, and from her actions so far, that she is someone who is unbalanced, and thrives on confrontation and drama. ‘I do not think it is wise to indulge her and therefore have nothing to say.’ One student who received the email said he found it ‘hilarious’, and that it has been sent around the university from friend to friend. The second-year law student said: ‘I don’t know much  about Miss Russell, but she is attractive for a middle-aged woman.’ The University of Bath declined to comment on the incident, saying that it is ‘a personal and not a university matter’.

The daughter of disgraced politician John Edwards has said she maintains a relationship with her 4-year-old half sister, who was conceived out of her father's love affair with his videographer during his bid for the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination. 'She's my sister... she's just a really sweet, innocent little girl,' Cate Edwards, 31, said of 4-year-old Quinn Hunter in an interview with NBC's Savannah Guthrie. 'I certainly think of her as part of our family.' Quinn is the daughter of John Edwards' former mistress Rielle Hunter, whom Cate said she hasn't seen in years. Hunter has recently published a tell-all book about her romance with the former North Carolina senator. Scroll down for video . Devastated: John Edwards' daughter Cate said that her father was the one to tell her about his affair with videographer Rielle Hunter . Stepping out: Cate Edwards sat down for her first interview about her father John's affair . 'She's my sister:' Cate Edwards said she maintains a relationship with her 4-year-old half sister, Quinn, (pictured with Edwards), who was conceived out of her father's love affair . Cate Edwards said she met Rielle while she was working on her father's campaign and that she hasn't seen her since. Asked about Rielle's book, Edwards said, 'I thought it was a poor choice... that's all I can say.' Edwards said she was angry at her father when he told her about the affair, but that she eventually forgave him. 'I was devastated, and I was disappointed,' she said. 'Forgiveness is a tough thing... It was hard, but we worked through it.' She couldn't answer to whether her . father was every forgiven by her mother, Elizabeth Edwards, who died of . cancer less than three years ago at the age of 61. Siblings: Cate Edwards has two younger siblings, . Emma Claire, who is 14, and Jack, who is 12, who are now being raised . by her father . 'I think she did [forgive him],' Edwards said of her mother. 'I don't know the answer to that. 'I think . she had a mix of emotions.' Despite the affair, John Edwards wanted to be by Elizabeth's side on her deathbed. 'He called and said, ""Can I come?"" Cate recalled. 'I said, ""Mom, can Dad come?"" And she said ""yes.""' Looking back on their final moments . together, she said, 'The three of us, especially, have been through so . much together, so we garner a lot of strength from one another, and I . think being together during that time - and also for the kids, to have . their family together during that time - was incredibly important.' Cate Edwards has two younger siblings, Emma Claire, who is 14, and Jack, who is 12, who are now being raised by her father. She was very close to her mother, . telling NBC that she was particularly upset by her mother's absence from . her October 2011 wedding. Family: Cate was very close to her mother Elizabeth (seen here in 2008), who died of cancer in 2010, and ever since Cate has been helping raise her younger siblings Emma Claire and Jack . Big day: Cate got married in 2011, and her sister Emma Claire (right) served in the wedding party. She said that her wedding was one of the biggest days that she missed her mother . Love: Cate Edwards' husband says she's a deeply compassionate woman . But she also misses her mother in small ways every day, she said. 'I mean, I get away with bad grammar,' she said, grinning. 'I never used to get away with bad grammar.' The affair between Edwards and Hunter . began while he was campaigning for the highest office in the land back . in 2004, and he waited until it was clear that he would neither be the . presidential nor vice presidential nominee to sit down in 2008 and admit . that he had cheated on his popular wife Elizabeth. In a 2008 interview, Edwards said that he did have an affair with Hunter but he was not the father of her daughter Quinn. He later retracted this statement. Speaking out: Cate was listed as a possible witness during the trial but she was never called to the stand . Throughout the ordeal, Edwards' aide Andrew Young volunteered to pretend that he was the father of Hunter's child, and they used nearly $1million to cover Hunter's tracks, flying her across country with the Youngs and keeping her hidden in various mansions. That money was the focus of the federal trial against Edwards, where they had to prove that the money used to hide Hunter was given by personal donors who understood that it was not so much a political donation to Edwards' campaign but that it was being used to help hide the word of the affair. Cate was actually listed by the defense as a possible witness in Edwards' case, but she was never actually called to the stand. The public attention surrounding the Edwards family drama did not die down after the trial ended in May, as Hunter released a tell-all book just a few months later where she trashed Elizabeth. In her book 'What Really Happened: John Edwards, Our Daughter and Me', Hunter describes the Edwards' marriage as broken by the time she arrived on the scene. Rielle Hunter announced last summer that she and her longtime lover John Edwards are 'no longer a couple' She wrote that Elizabeth- who at the time was battling her second bout of breast cancer- was a 'witch on wheels' who belittled her beloved Johnny and was very aware that their marriage was on the outs. Hunter has faced much criticism for painting such a grim portrait of Elizabeth in her book, especially since she died in 2010 and she can no longer respond to Hunter's claims. That criticism was echoed by Cate in her NBC interview, set to air on Friday. 'I just thought it was — I thought it was a poor choice, I guess, is all I can say,' Cate said diplomatically. As for Hunter's current role in their family, it remains unclear as she said during her book tour that she and 'Johnny' had just decided to end their relationship, though that announcement came just days after they were pictured enjoying a beach vacation with Quinn for Father's Day.","Cate Edwards, 31, said she was 'devastated' and 'disappointed' when her father told her about his affair .

Jason McPartland, 41, strode on stage and hit Darren Price in the face before telling him: ‘Shut up before you get another slap.’ It is the latest incident to shame the ITV1 programme, previously branded ‘a form of human bear baiting’ by a judge. The show, which was never broadcast, was on the theme ‘You can’t stop me  seeing our children just because you hate my new girlfriend!’ McPartland is the uncle of Mr Price’s former girlfriend, who was also on stage. Magistrates heard that he had been deliberately wound up by production staff before being brought on. The court was also told that they tried to dissuade Mr Price from reporting the attack to police. McPartland, of Birmingham, admitted assault and was given a six-month community order with supervision. He had been a supporting guest at the filming at Granada Studios in Manchester last July for his niece, Helen McPartland. She was there to discuss relationship problems with Mr Price. In a clip shown to the court, presenter Kyle asks her: ‘Who’s Jason?’ to which she responds: ‘My uncle.’ SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Furious: He assaulted a relative, Darren Price, on the Jeremy Kyle show during filming in Manchester claiming he was protecting his niece . Upset: McPartland said staff had been saying back stage that the victim, Mr Price, had been calling him names . Kyle then calls out: ‘Let’s get Jason . on the Jeremy Kyle show!’ at which the tattooed, shaven-headed guest . strides on stage to yells and whoops from the studio audience. McPartland immediately attacks Mr Price before being grabbed by security guards. Following the blow – obscured in the . footage – Kyle tells him to sit down, saying: ‘You’ll not be on this . stage if you ever do anything like that again.’ Controversial: ITV today denied their staff had 'goaded' the guest before he lashed out . McPartland says on camera: ‘Yes, I . have just hit him,’ adding: ‘Shut up before you get another slap.’ Clare . Byers, prosecuting, said Mr Price had warned show staff beforehand that . he believed McPartland to be a violent man. After filming had finished, he told staff he wanted the police to be called, she added. ‘They said to “leave the police for . now and that your main concern is the kids”,’ she said. ‘Aftercare . advised not to contact the police.’ But Mr Price, who suffered reddening . and soreness, reported the incident when he returned home to Margate, . Kent. Gina Clayton, defending, said McPartland would not have committed . the assault if he had not been egged on by staff. ‘He was told that the complainant had . been calling him names,’ she said. ‘He was provoked by staff to the . point that when he came on stage, he was particularly angry. ‘He was wound up by Jeremy Kyle staff in order to provoke a specific reaction.’ Miss McPartland and Mr Price had previously lived together and rowed over debts, Manchester City Magistrates’ Court heard. McPartland was also said to have been upset at comments Mr Price made about his late father on the show. Incident: A judge called the Kyle show a 'human form of bear baiting' when David Staniforth headbutted bus driver Larry Mahoney, leaving him with blood pouring from his nose . Magistrate Vanessa Goldstone said she accepted he had been goaded but that was no excuse. ‘On the one hand, we see that you were provoked by the show but you should have had the ability to control yourself,’ she said. Assault: Rebecca Langley (pictured) was hurt by her partner Jamie Juste after they appeared Jeremy Kyle TV show . ‘It is never acceptable to punch another person regardless of the history and the goading. ‘We see there was a lot of goading on The Jeremy Kyle Show.’ McPartland, who had no previous convictions, was also ordered to pay £50 compensation. After the hearing, an ITV spokesman said: ‘The Jeremy Kyle Show does not show violence and  neither does it condone it.’ She denied there was any goading or that staff advised against reporting the assault to police. In 2007, District Judge Alan Berg said the show was ‘a form of human bear baiting’ aimed at  titillating bored viewers. He spoke out after hearing how David . Staniforth, 45, butted Larry Mahoney, a lodger who had an affair with . his wife, at the studios. In 2009, Judge Sean Enright said the . programme exploited ‘foolish and gullible’ people as he jailed Jamie . Juste, 26, for attacking his girlfriend Rebecca Langley after an episode . on her alleged infidelity was shown.","Jason McPartland, 41, hit his victim in an episode too violent for broadcast .

Loss: Morgan Lide (pictured back, center) has drowned during a study abroad year in Indonesia . She had attended the high school for three years before starting the Kennedy-Lugar Youth Exchange and Study Abroad Program in September, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. The year abroad is sponsored by the U.S. Department of State and the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, and allows students to learn about another culture while continuing high school. Lide blogged about her experiences abroad, posting pictures of life with her host family and reflecting on the importance of what she was undertaking.

Mike Merrill found life as a customer service rep at a small software company in Oregon less than fulfilling. What he would much rather be doing was pursuing his passion as an entrepreneur. He had loads of great ideas and ambitions, but no venture capital to live the dream. Creative: Mike Merrill decided to solve his cash flow problem by selling himself off to shareholders online . His answer? Sell himself on the open market. He divided himself into 100,000 shares at $1 a piece, with the promise of returns on any profits he made outside his day job. That was in 2008 and before long a handful of friends and even his girlfriend bought a total of 929 shares. It was only 0.9 per cent, but he at least ended up with some extra cash. He set up a website KmikeyM.com where anyone could buy into him, with the initial idea to create an open-ended version of crowd-funding website Kickstarter, he told The Atlantic. Unusual businessman: Merrill promised returns on any profits he made outside his day job to his investors . Shareholder approval: Merrill is so dedicated to his investors that the can vote on all aspects of his life . But instead of just one project, investors would get a say in which ideas he pursued. For example, he put whether he should make a short video to market his shares to a vote, but shareholders decided instead to invest $80 in a Rwandan chicken farmer. Very soon he found they wanted to ballot on his private life, too,  it was reported by www.wired.com. The issue came to a head when his girlfriend and shareholder, Willow McCormick, moved in with him, something the other shareholders feared would affect their investments. After all, if he was going to spend more time at home with Willow, he would have less time to pursue their interests. Merrill had not envisaged giving them any control, but gradually came round to the idea. 'I . figured they'd make good decisions for me, since they had money on the . line and wanted to see their investment appreciate,' Merrill, 35, told Wired. He was so taken with the new slant on his . scheme that he asked the shareholders whether he should get a vasectomy, . given that the 'time investment of raising a child is immense.' Extreme entrepreneur: Mike Merrill's shareholders started pushing for a say in private as well as professional life, including who he dates and when he has children . McCormick was livid. 'He made our personal life public without consulting me,' she said. To her, it was a referendum on whether she would be a suitable mother. By pulling favours with some of the other . shareholders, she managed to get the vasectomy rejected 456 votes to . 387, but it was the beginning of the end for them. After five years . together, they decided to split. Lucrative: Merrill's graph shows how his stock has appreciated in value since 2008 up to a high of $20 . 'I felt like our relationship didn’t come first in his life,' she said. 'The Mike I knew got swallowed up by KmikeyM.' Despite such setbacks, Merrill maintains that having investors 'holding me accountable' has improved his life. As for the investors, the values of their shares rise and fall, purely on the basis of demand. A demand in making decisions that keep him productive - whether it was boosting his workout regime with martial-arts classes or registering as a Republican. They are currently trading at $11 a piece. As for his love life, according to The Atlantic, he now has another girlfriend with whom he has just renewed his 'contract' for another three months - with shareholder approval, of course.","Mike Merrill, 30, divided himself into 100,000 shares to make money .

In their early twenties, most young women are just getting to grips with what they want out of life. After her Oscars success on Sunday night, 24-year-old Adele Adkins could be said to have done it all. But as she clutched her statuette the singer-songwriter confided she’d been left reflecting how different it all might have been, given her tough start in a cramped London flat. Fabulous life: Adele giving her Oscars statuette a big kiss after accepting the award for Bond theme Skyfall . The star, who won the Oscar for best . song for her Bond theme Skyfall, said: ‘When I got back to my dressing . room I thought it could have been a bit grim my life. But it’s not, it’s . fabulous!’ Adele was just three when her father left the family home and descended into alcoholism. They . were estranged during her teenage years, when he was drinking as much . as two litres of vodka a day. He has since admitted: ‘I was a rotten . father at a time when she really needed me.’ Adele . attended ten schools as her mother moved them from flat to flat, mostly . around South London, trying to make ends meet with a string of jobs. Adele’s Oscar triumph comes less than a week after Skyfall won her the Brit award for best single. Going places: Adele shone in her dress at the awards, proving yet again that her background won't stop her . Reflection: 'I could have had a grim life,' the 24-year-old said at the Academy Awards on Sunday night . A few months earlier she had pulled . off a Golden Globe in Hollywood for best film song as well as a . statuette for best solo pop performance at the Grammys. All this success . has come as Adele underwent potentially career-wrecking throat surgery, . found love with partner Simon Konecki and had her first baby, Angelo, . last October. As the ultimate award, Hollywood diva Barbra Streisand, 70, cooed  at the Academy Awards: ‘She’s  one of us.’ Adele . struggled to hold back tears as she accepted the Oscar with the song’s . co-writer Paul Epworth. In her speech, she paid tribute to her . management team and to Mr Konecki, saying: ‘I love you baby.’ Afterwards . she admitted her accolades in the last few weeks had left her with a . problem.

Tearful: New mother Adele struggled to hold back the waterworks as she accepted her award . 'Love you baby!': Adele thanked her management and partner Simon Konecki in her acceptance speech . ‘I haven’t decided where to put it . [the Oscar] yet. I want it to be somewhere where I’ll see it every day. Bathroom, bedroom, yeah, somewhere like that. I’ll fathom it out when I . get back home.’ She won’t be . the only Brit with space problems.

Suspended: Doctor Mohammed Al-Byati has been suspended by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester . An Iraqi doctor who spent seven years in the NHS after working at the heart of Saddam Hussein’s brutal regime was banned from practising yesterday for being complicit in torture. Mohammed Al-Byati, 47, was branded an ‘accessory to torture’ who knew that injured detainees he treated at Iraq’s notorious intelligence HQ had been subjected to violent interrogation. The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester ruled the father-of-three must have known they would be tortured again after he had treated them. It imposed the maximum 12-month suspension on his medical registration, but did not strike him off, accepting his claim he had only been following orders during his mandatory military service as a junior doctor and hadn’t taken part in torture. Dr Al-Byati, who lives in Birmingham, left Iraq in 1995, coming to Britain five years later and working in NHS hospitals from 2004, specialising in rheumatology. But in 2007 his work permit expired and, fearing being sent back to his homeland at the height of sectarian violence, he applied for asylum on the grounds he had worked for Saddam’s hated regime. Professor Michael Whitehouse, chairman of the fitness to practise panel, said the ban was needed ‘to demonstrate clearly to him, the profession and the public that even though his involvement as an accessory to torture was outside his control, such conduct is unacceptable’. But Professor Whitehouse added: ‘He was a junior doctor whose behaviour was being controlled by a dictatorial, totalitarian regime which used systematic, widespread and extremely grave violations of human rights to control the population. Dissent from orders was not tolerated.’ The panel said no complaints had been lodged about his conduct since arriving in Britain. Dr Al-Byati is understood to have been granted asylum with his family, including a son aged nine who was born in Britain. Mr Al-Byati applied for asylum when his work permit ran out and told officials he treated detainees of the notorious Iraq Intelligence Agency during the brutal regime of Saddam Hussein, pictured, as part of his mandatory military service .","Mohammed Al-Byati, 47, spent seven years working in the NHS as a doctor .

Accused: Shareyll Hunter, 26 (pictured), allegedly drove a car into Alise Kelly, 21, pinning her against the wall of a house in Houston . A pregnant woman has had her foot amputated after a love rival deliberately crashed a car into her - pinning her against a building, police said. Alise Kelly needed specialist hospital care after Shareyll Hunter allegedly crushed her against the house in Houston where Ms Kelly's boyfriend - and Hunter's ex - Chris Chaney lived. The horrifying incident is said to have happened after Hunter, 26, who is also pregnant, turned up at Mr Chaney's home this morning and began arguing with Ms Kelly. The force of the crash left a wall at the property partly demolished. A shoe, apparently belonging to Ms Kelly, could be seen lying amongst the rubble after being knocked off. Mr Chaney told khou.com that he was in the house asleep when Hunter arrived at the property. He said the pair had been 'texting and talking over the phone saying they want to fight each other and meet up right here and do it.' Mr Chaney said that when he came outside he saw Ms Hunter shouting that she wanted to fight Ms Kelly. The police said Hunter eventually jumped into his Lincoln car and put her foot down - pinning Ms Kelly, 21, against the house. Witnesses have spoken of hearing Ms Kelly screaming in agony after being hit by the vehicle and out of fear for her unborn child. Both of her legs are believed to have been broken during the incident. Crash: Ms Kelly was badly injured in the horrifying incident. A shoe, apparently belonging to her, could be seen in the rubble .

One of her feet was so badly damaged it had to be amputated - but her baby is thought to be unharmed. Hunter, who is five months pregnant, is then alleged to have sped off in Mr Chaney's Lincoln LS car - and has not yet been caught by the police.

Florida Gulf Coast basketball coach Andy Enfield took to court with his wife and family for his team's final practice before their historic NCAA tournament match-up tonight. The underdog college shocked the nation earlier this week when they became the first 15th seed to the advance to the Sweet Sixteen stage of the tournament. And Enfield and his wife Amanda- who gave up a modelling career where she starred in ad campaigns for Victoria's Secret, Armani and Chanel- have taken the media by storm. She was seen holding their son Marcum, whose name is her maiden name, while they watch ‘dad’ at work with his team in the Cowboys stadium in Arlington, Texas. The relatively unknown team will face off their in-state rivals of Florida State University on Friday, which will determine whether they last one more round in the annual tournament. Star off the court: Amanda Enfield, the wife of the Florida Gulf Coast coach Andy Enfield, has earned a good deal of attention due to her model looks . Cheering squad: She was spotted with the couple's nearly 2-year-old son Marcum watching the team practice in the Texas stadium on Thursday in preparation for their big game on Friday . Family portrait: Amanda has shunned her new-found bout of fame, saying that she has no plans to return to modeling and prefers to raise their three children at home . Amanda, 34, says that she has ‘mixed emotions’ about the new wave of attention that she has been granted in light of her husband’s success on the court, but because she already had her brush with modelling fame at an early age, she seems reluctant to pursue a second round. 'I never expected this. I'm flattered, and I think it's great, but it's also kind of crazy to me,' she said in an interview with USA Today. ‘I guess it's kind of cool but it's still a bit surreal to me. ‘I just don't think I should be the focus at all. The team is the biggest story. The best part is seeing Andy and the players have their dreams actually come true. They are so happy.’ Dad's turn: Andy Enfield and his team, including player Brett Comer seen playing with Marcum, have become the unlikely Cinderella story of the NCAA tournament due to their unexpected success . Instead she is happy staying a full-time mom to her three children: daughters Aila, 6, and Lily, 5, with son Marcum turning 2 next month. Basketball has had an integral role in the couple’s relationship, as they met at a regional tournament when her native Oklahoma State team was playing in New York and he was passing through town with a mutual friend on the way to a NCAA tournament. He proposed by hiding the engagement ring in a box of Krispy Kreme donuts, and the rest is history. ‘She was still in the prime of her modelling career. For her to give up that to be a coach's wife and have children is something in itself. She is an amazing (mother),’ Enfield said of his wife.

She is just one of the reasons why the team is getting an unexpected amount of attention in this year’s March Madness. They shocked the nation by staging two massive upsets- beating Georgetown and San Diego State- in the NCAA men's basketball tournament and becoming the first 15-seed team ever to reach the Sweet Sixteen round. In addition to their basketball skills, the team has earned themselves a spot as fan favorites with on the court antics that include dunks, laughs, and now a coordinated dance. Enfield said his key to victory has always been a work hard-play hard mentality. 'We don't take ourselves too seriously,' said Florida Gulf Coast coach Andy Enfield, whose players tossed him in the air and doused him with water in a raucous celebration before his postgame interviews. Bombshell: Mrs Enfield appeared on the cover of the February 2002 swimsuit issue of Maxim. She posed for the men's magazine on several occasions .

'We try to have fun, get serious when we have to. Our goal was to make history and we did it.' A week ago, Florida Gulf Coast .

Now the Eagles are the high-flying . show from 'Dunk City' in the round of 16, the darlings of the South .

'Things have changed dramatically,' FGCU coach Enfield said. 'The way we looked at it, we did make . history. ... We feel like we shocked the world,' said Brett Comer, the . guard with 22 points and 24 assists in two NCAA games. 'Nobody picked us to beat Georgetown, or San Diego State, for sure. We're going to prepare for Florida the same way. We're going to try to win again.' The Eagles are in the round of 16 in only their second season being eligible for the NCAA tournament. Florida, a state school with nearly 50,000 students, has a roster loaded with NCAA experience. It is the first time that two teams from the same state have meet in this round of the NCAA tournament. 'Dunk City': Florida Gulf Coast player Chase Fieler dunks over a San Diego State player. The Eagles have quickly developed a reputation for spectacular plays . Big win: Florida Gulf Coast's made its first big statement on Friday night when the little-known team beat Georgetown, one of the top-ranked teams in the tournament . Hang time: Georgetown's defeat was the first upset of the tournament that resonated across the country . Florida, which won consecutive national . titles in 2006 and 2007, has been to regional finals each of the last . two years. But this is the last chance for seniors Kenny Boynton, Erik .

Yet, most of the attention is going to . the smaller school about 250 miles away that the Gators have played . only once before. That was a 94-60 Florida victory at home in 2008, when . Florida Gulf Coast was in only its second season of Division I . competition. Florida Gulf Coast did play this . season against the third Florida team that made it to the round of 16.

Jason Dufner was sitting in a classroom with children for a charity . event when he leaned against a wall and zoned out for a minute. That's all it took for one photo that went viral and made Dufner a Twitter sensation. Dufner, dressed in a red golf shirt, is shown slouched against the . wall at J. Erik Jonsson Community School in Dallas, next to two children . who are listening intently to the teacher. In the image that launched the meme, Jason Dufner leans against a wall during an appearance at J. Erik Jonsson Community School . A good sport, Dufner retweeted several pictures of people mimicking him . Even Dufner's fellow golfers got in on the act . His legs are erect, his arms . stiff at his side, and he has a vacant look on his face. Dufner is . known for showing little emotion, even with a major championship at . stake. He looks even more lifeless in this photo. 'Just caught me at a perfect time,' Dufner said Friday from Auburn, . Ala. 'The funny thing about it is the photo taken represents how I act . all the time. It was a sheer moment of 'Jason Dufner' by whoever . captured the moment for the 30 seconds I checked out.' That would be Christine Lee of KXAS-TV, a video journalist for the . NBC affiliate in Dallas who was covering Dufner's appearance at the . school. Dufner won the Byron Nelson Championship last year. The Salesmanship . Club of Dallas, which runs the tournament, directs some of its . charitable proceeds to the school for disadvantaged children. To drum up . publicity as the defending champion, Dufner made an appearance at the . school Thursday. Not everyone who dufners does it on purpose . People from all walks of life were amused by Dufner's slouch . He never imagined where it would lead. Lee took a photo of Dufner in that perfect moment and gave it to sports anchor David Watkins, who posted it to Twitter. Among those who saw it was Keegan Bradley, who beat Dufner in a . playoff for the 2011 PGA Championship and has been engaged in friendly . banter over the last month. And it took off from there. Dufner's name became a verb. It's call 'dufnering.' Luke Donald tweeted a photo of a pillow under his shirt as he . slouched against the wall in his home. Rory McIlroy was dufnering in his . hotel room, and he couldn't stop talking about it Friday at the Houston . Open. Dufner is known for his stoic expressions on tour . At one point in his round, he walked behind the 13th green, saw a . reporter and said, 'Did you see the Dufner photo? How good is that? That's the greatest thing I've ever seen!' Bubba Watson was dufnering against his General Lee 01 car. Dufner . even got in on the act Friday, dufnering in the weight room at Auburn. Those who think it's an example of a professional golfer who couldn't . be bothered spending time in a classroom with children were missing the . point. Dufner always looks that way. Even in the PGA playoff at Atlanta . Athletic Club, he didn't appear to have a pulse. In an era when players don't always return to the cities where they . won, Dufner participated in two media days in one week. He was in New . Orleans on Wednesday (the Zurich Open was his first PGA Tour win), and . then headed to Dallas for the classroom. The subject? 'They were talking about focusing and relaxation,' Dufner said, a . master at the latter. 'They have some big test coming up for the class . on ways to relax and concentrate. And I guess I took it to another . level.' Since the image went viral, a siege of imitators posted photos of themselves 'dufnering' After all the Twitter photos of people 'dufnering,' the man himself finally replied. 'What can I say, I was tired, my back hurt from sitting on the floor, . and we were talking about relaxation and focusing. (hash)dufnering' he . tweeted. By then, it was all the rage. Dufner thought nothing of the charity event until he arrived at the . airport and noticed the photo had been posted on Deadspin. Bradley took . over from there. 'Every time I looked at it, I laughed harder than the first time,' Bradley said from the Houston Open. 'Dufner is so funny with some of the . things he does. That's him.' Bradley said he has never seen his Twitter account fill up with . thousands of pictures and responses, and he was stunned to wake up . Friday morning to see that 'dufnering' was trending on Twitter, . especially during the NCAA basketball tournament and American idol. When he arrived at Redstone on Friday morning, he got together with . Dustin Johnson and Brandt Snedeker for a 'dufnering' pose by the putting . green. 'I saw a basketball player doing it in the locker room,' Snedeker . said. 'I never knew Dufner had such a wide range of appeal. His . personality is not a welcoming personality. But once you get to know . him, he's actually one of the funniest guys you'll ever meet. He just . doesn't give you anything on the golf course.' Dufner said he slouched down because he'd been sitting for hours and his back hurt . Snedeker's impression of the photo? 'It looks like someone put him in timeout,' he said. Dufner, however, figures he's getting the last laugh. Hardly anyone . knew who he was two years ago. Then, he lost a four-shot lead with three . holes to play in the PGA Championship and wound up losing to Bradley in . a playoff. He handled the loss with dignity and — as always — no . emotion. A year later, he won in New Orleans and Dallas in the span of a . month, and played on his first Ryder Cup team, winning three of four . matches. 'I think Keegan tried to use it against me but it blew up in his face with all the publicity,' Dufner said with a chuckle. So what's next? Dufnering at Augusta National during the Masters? 'Oh, for sure,' McIlroy said. 'I would 'Dufner' on the lawn. No. On the tree out back by the clubhouse.' About the only person not caught up in all the hype is Dufner's wife, Amanda. 'She gets to see me 'dufnering' the most,' Dufner said.","Dufner said his back hurt from hours of sitting .

The uncle of 'Blade Runner' Oscar Pistorius said his nephew is not a liar and has 'no intention to travel overseas', only hours after the sprinter was granted permission to travel abroad. A South African judge relaxed bail conditions yesterday imposed after the Paralympic and Olympic track star was charged with murdering his girlfriend on Valentine's Day. Arnold Pistorius said the ordeal had brought the Pistorius family closer together, adding that they wished to connect with the family of Reeva Steenkamp in the future. Scroll down for video . Verdict: Lawyers for Oscar Pistorius successfully appealed against some of his bail restrictions on Thursday . 'We can just imagine Reeva's mother . and father and their family, what they must be going through, it is . unthinkable. So, we hope to meet them one day and try to share this . hardship with them, that we also experience.' Stressing his family's support and a belief in his nephew's innocence, Arnold Pistorius said Oscar was not a 'liar'. 'We . know the facts and we know exactly what was going on, because Oscar is . not a liar. The one thing, he has made a lot of mistakes, but the one . thing he has never done is lie. 'So we trust him - what he said to us - as the facts. And it was a terrible, terrible mistake.' Speaking about the family of model Reeva Steenkamp, Arnold Pistorius said he could not imagine their grief. 'One . can never feel that pain that a mother and a father must feel for the . child that they have lost, that must be terrible. And for Oscar to have . lost... what is worse than losing somebody you love and you have been . the... the instrument? It is unthinkable.' Asked if Pistorius would be returning to the competitive track in the near future, his uncle revealed:'Not in the near future, not realistically. No, I don't think so. In the future - perhaps, yes, I would like to say that.' Set for a return? Pistorius wins gold in the men's 400m - T44 final at the . London Paralympics. His lawyers argued that he might need to run at track meets . again to earn money . Conditions: Pistorius must provide authorities with his travel plans at . least a week before he leaves the country. He must also return his passport to the court within 24 hours of returning to South Africa . Arnold . Pistorius added that family members were encouraging the athlete to . return to training, fearing it would affect his long term performance. 'The . knowledgeable people tell me that if a super athlete does not train for . a year then he will never get back to where he was. So we try to . convince him to get back into training.' The runner is free to compete in Britain this summer after a judge relaxed his bail terms yesterday to allow him to make money . Lawyers for the ‘Blade Runner’ successfully argued that he should be allowed to travel abroad and ‘earn . income’ while awaiting trial. Defence: Pistorius says he killed girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp accidentally when he fired shots through a door in his bathroom in the pre-dawn hours, fearing there was an intruder in his house . The controversial decision clears the way for him to take part in London’s showpiece athletics event at the Olympic Stadium. Pistorius, 26, is charged with the . murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, who was shot after she locked . herself in his bathroom in the early hours of Valentine’s Day. He claims . he mistook her for an intruder. The Olympic and Paralympic athlete . was not present as judge Bert Bam told North Gauteng High Court in South . Africa that bail restrictions should be eased to allow Pistorius to . travel abroad to compete at international athletics meetings, provided . he handed over a detailed itinerary at least a week before his . departure. Miss Steenkamp’s family did not comment on the decision, which came despite strong objections from prosecutors. Victim: Reeva Steenkamp, a successful South African fashion model and television personality,  was found dead at the home she shared with the paralympic athlete . It is certain to prove controversial . as  it potentially paves the way for Pistorius, one of the world’s most . successful athletes, to earn vast sums of money while he  is awaiting . trial. Although charged with murder, . Pistorius has not been convicted of any crime  and would be allowed to . enter Britain by the Home Office. It is now likely that he will compete . at the London Anniversary Games, which takes place from July 26 to 28 . at the Olympic Stadium in East London – one year on from London 2012 and . the final event at the venue before work begins to convert into the . home of West Ham football club. It is also the last major athletics event before the World Championships in Moscow two weeks later. Significantly, Pistorius’ agent Peet van . Zyl said yesterday that the competitions could be ‘on the radar’ for . the athlete, who  last year became the first to  take part in both an . Olympic and Paralympic Games. The International Association of . Athletics Federations said the double amputee would be allowed to . compete in this summer’s competitions if he qualifies. Yannis Nikolau, spokesman for the . ruling body, added that Pistorus would be ‘free to run . . . on the . basis of the “innocent until proven guilty” principle’. Pistorius competes against able-bodied athletes during London's 2012 Olympic games . There . is also the possibility that Pistorius, who can receive tens of . thousands of pounds in appearance money, could compete in the British . Athletics Birmingham Grand Prix at the end of June. At . yesterday’s bail appeal hearing, Pistorius’ lawyer Barry Roux said that . while his client had no immediate plans to compete, it is likely he . would need to return to the track to earn money. Since . his arrest the Paralympic gold medallist has sold assets including a . share in a racehorse and property. ‘He is not going to run away and . hide. He is going nowhere,’ Mr Roux told the judge. ‘It’s only, only, only to earn . income . . . No other reason and under controlled circumstances. Why . stop him from travelling under controlled circumstances?’ Mr Roux also argued that Pistorius . should be able to return to his home and the scene of the shooting, . which has been investigated by the prosecution. ‘The accused can’t be stopped [from . going] back to his house indefinitely,’ he insisted. Pistorius claims he . killed 29-year-old model Miss Steenkamp accidentally when he fired . shots through his bathroom door in the early hours, fearing she was an . intruder. Prosecutors say he shot her intentionally after they argued. His bail terms originally required . him to hand over his passport, avoid his home in Pretoria and all . witnesses in the case, report to a police station twice a week and . abstain from drinking alcohol. But these rules were relaxed by Judge Bam, who described the decision not to grant Pistorius permission to travel as ‘wrong’. He also no longer has to be regularly supervised by a probation official and the ban against him drinking alcohol was lifted.","Arnold Pistorius said ordeal brought the Pistorius family closer together .

In an age where it seems every man, woman and child has an iPad, one man has struck a chord by singing about the simpler times of his childhood. And his nostalgic lyrics about the 1980s have made his track a YouTube sensation. Graham Wood's hit 'We didn't own an iPad' has already received more than 1.6 million views on YouTube since it went online earlier this month. Scroll down for video . The gardener sings about the joy of using Teletext, rather than constantly tapping out text messages on a smart phone . Playstations and X-Boxes were a long way off in the 1980s, when youngsters had to be content with board games like Connect 4 . Cartoons such as Top Cat were a firm favourite amongst the younger generation who adored the cheeky feline . Turn back time: This is a far cry from the slim, stylish technology that most people crave now . They don't make them like that anymore: Paper £1 notes, Teletext and Top Cat area ll things of the past, the singer laments . The song is a celebration of his and . millions of other people's childhood memories and is a parody of the . Billy Joel song 'We didn't start the fire'. Graham . has changed the lyrics that now namecheck dozens of items relating to . the 80s such as PacMan, Roland Rat, TizWaz, Connect Four, video casettes . and the Walkman. The 39-year-old gardener . references TV programmes such as Mr Ben, Swap Shop, Grange Hill, . Blockbusters and Knight Rider and games like Tonka trucks, Subbuteo and . Speak and Spell. Fashion . trends moon boots, shell suits, and shoulder pads are mentioned along . with iconic events including Charles and Diana's wedding and Michael . Fish's infamous weather forecast.

PacMan, He-Man, tape . casette, Walkman, Buckaroo, Emu, Michael Knight's car.' It then goes into the chorus of 'We didn't own an iPad, never heard of texting only Teletexting, we didn't own an iPad, never heard of SatNavs only used AA maps'. The video wistfully remembers long-forgotten features of the 1980s... including tasty Marathon bars before they turned into Snickers . The video flashes up images that anybody alive in the 1980s will fondly remember - from a lack of mobile phones to Shep, the beloved Blue Peter dog . The video recalls events that shocked the world - including John Lennon's death - but keeps it lighthearted with references to children's book characters . Graham, from Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, provides the vocals and he got his musical friend Andrew Barker to play his ukelele for the backing track. As well as the YouTube views, millions of social media users have also linked to the song, which has gone viral. The . married father-of-two came up with the idea after hearing a feature on a . radio show about a man who found a 'things to do before the age of 40' list from the 1980s. Graham, who goes by hunkygraham1 on YouTube, said: 'I was listening to the radio when I came up with the idea. 'They were doing a feature of a ""40 . list"", a list of things the presenter wanted to do before he was 40 that . he wrote when he was a teenager and found in his parent's attic. The height of technology: This game had children everywhere going mad to get their hands on one . This was the dreaded sight that many youngsters faced when they turned their televisions on before the programmes began . The video has struck a chord with its audience, who have reminisced about the age before mobile phones . This toy was on the wish list for many a child, who pinned their hopes on Star Wars games, rather than iPads . The video is a parody of the Billy Jole classic, and has already nocthed up millions of views . 'Not long after that I heard the Billy . Joel track which I have always liked, and before I knew it was thinking . up a few lines to my own song. 'To be honest, I don't own an iPad and . I don't have a clue how they work, but now people are relying on them . and other technology for entertainment. 'I . enjoyed going back to my old days and how it used to be when I was . creating the video and whenever I came up with an idea I would tap it . into my phone so I didn't forget. 'I spent hours poring over the images on Google but making the song and the video itself didn't take long at all. Graham Wood's (right) nostalgic hit 'We didn't own an iPad', which he produced with friend Andrew Barker (left) has already received more than 1.6 million views on YouTube and is a parody of the Billy Joel song 'We didn't start the fire' 'When I uploaded it to YouTube I didn't expect it to get so many views, I was hoping it might get 1,000 or so. 'I put it on Facebook and thanks to . all of my friends who started sharing it, more and more people watched . it, and it went a bit crazy. It's incredible really.' Graham has now signed up with Viral Spiral, a London-based company which specialises in helping viral video owners. Damian Collier, founder of Viral Spiral, said: 'Once you pass one million hits that is a sign of considerable success from a viral video perspective.

The move is unusual in that the CEO of Facebook has traditionally avoided large partisan contributions, instead donating to community-based charities. The political network: Mark Zuckerberg, pictured at Facebook headquarters earlier this month, is forming a SuperPAC focusing on immigration reform, sources said . Fast friends: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, left, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, center, and Newark Mayor Cory Booker, right, spoke at an educational summit earlier this year . The tech guru is exploring a SuperPAC to push the issues and has already poured in millions of his personal fortune, the San Francisco Chronicle originally reported. The independent expenditure group is expected to focus mainly on immigration reform, and making it easier for international talent to work in the U.S. According to Politico, the group also seeks to support reform that would allow undocumented immigrants achieve a path to American citizenship, a move that they believe supports a robust economy and strengthens the nation. Sources told the Chronicle that the independent expenditure group was initially formed to Zuckerberg’s former Harvard roommate, Joe Green. Green declined comment because the group is in early stages. Raising funds: Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, held a fundraiser for Gov Christie at their $7million home in Palo Alto last month . Host and hostess: Zuckerberg's wife, Priscilla Chan, helped entertain Gov. Christie at their home for the fundraiser . Earlier this month, Zuckerberg and other notable Silicon Valley players met with members of Congress and the president to discuss a ‘more open and flexible’ immigration system to allow the best and the brightest in the tech industry to work on America’s shores. According to the Chronicle, industry heavyweights included Google CEO Eric Schmidt as well as Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer. A source told Politico that the move isn’t necessarily driven by Facebook. ‘Leaders are coming together on a broader agenda,’ they said. Facebook did not immediately respond to MailOnline’s request for comment. In 2011, Zuckerberg donated $100million to help improve public schools in Newark, New Jersey, sparking a close-knit relationship with the state’s governor, Chris Christie. And last month, Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, hosted the Republican governor at their Palo Alto home for a fundraiser with many of Silicon Valley’s tech darlings, a move that stirred controversy among Democrats. In the wake of Hurricane Sandy, Christie’s popularity skyrocketed, with an all-time high approval rating of 74 percent among voters. The high numbers, as well as the high-profile fundraiser, have ignited rumors that Christie has his eye on the White House. Radio silence: Until now, Zuckerberg has been fairly reserved in his political spending, only donating $5,000 twice to Facebook's political action committee . In the past, Zuckerberg, who is worth $13.3billion as of this month, has not been vocal about his political believes. The Dobbs Ferry, New York native attended Harvard University, only to drop out when Facebook began taking off. According to the Chronicle, Zuckerberg will have Republican consulants Jon Lerner and Rob Jesmer on board, as well as former press secretary Joe Lockhart, who worked under former president Bill Clinton.","Sources said Zuckerberg is forming independent expenditure group focusing on immigration and education .

Eagerly anticipating a break in sunny Turkey, this couple booked themselves into an airport hotel the night before their flight to ensure the holiday got off to a smooth start. But despite their best-laid plans, Cai and Lynne Larsen, from North Wales, ended up missing their early-morning flight to Istanbul when they got stuck in a lift at the Ibis Hotel just 500 yards away from Luton Airport. The Larsens managed to send for help when the lift jammed in between floors as they made their way down to reception at 4am, but were still trapped as their plane was set to taxi along the runway almost two hours later. Stuck: Cai and Lynne Larsen missed their flight to Turkey because they were stuck in a lift at an airport hotel just 500 yards from where their plane was taking off . Instead of soaking up the sunshine on a . Mediterranean beach, the 'gutted' couple found themselves heading . back up the motorway to Caernarfon - although they did cheer themselves . up with a short break on Barry Island en route. Primary school teacher Mr Larsen, 53, said he and his wife dialled 999 from the jammed lift when they still hadn't been freed half an hour after alerting reception at 4am. The Larsens and another couple en route to catch a plane waited more than an hour to be freed, by which time their flight was due to take off from nearby Luton Airport. Convenient: The Welsh couple booked themselves into this Ibis hotel near Luton Airport the night before their flight to make sure their journey went smoothly . Dash: As their plane was taxiing along the runway at Luton Airpot, the frantic Larsens were stuck in the jammed hotel lift with their suitcases . 'We got into the lift  at 4am . with our suitcases - the hotel was so close to the airport we had left . plenty of time to check in. 'The lift only moved a few feet before it made a clunking sound and stopped. 'We repeatedly rang the lift alarm and made several calls to reception who kept saying an engineer was on its way. 'They kept saying he would be there in 15 minutes but time was going on so we rang the fire brigade.' Cai and Lynne, 54, were eventually freed from the lift at 5.45am - just 15 minutes before take off. The pair made a desperate dash for the departure desk but were told the flight to Istanbul had already left. Mishap: Lynne and Cai were trapped for almost two hours with another couple when the lift got stuck between floors . 'To say we were gutted is an understatement - we had been . looking forward to going on holiday for such a long time,' said father of five Mr Larsen. 'I complained to the staff on duty in the hotel but they said it wasn't their fault and that it was an act of nature. 'I explained it was their responsibility to ensure the lift was working properly but they didn't seem to get that.' The Larsens had been due to fly into . Istanbul for the first part of the trip before taking an internal flight . to the capital Ankara to explore the country further. The pair made do with a couple of days on . Barry Island on their way back to North Wales, but admitted it didn't . quite live up to the 11-day Easter trip to Turkey they had been looking forward to. 'We thought we would look at the sea and pretend it's the Mediterranean - but it's a lot colder,' Mr Larsen said. Destination: Instead of sunning themselves on a beach in Turkey (pictured), the Larsens ended up stopping off on Barry Island on their way home to North Wales . 'It's a lot colder': The Larsens admitted their short break on Barry Island didn't quite live up to the Turkish break they had been looking forward to .

You have heard of the Easter Bunny but these rare white lion cubs are giving an African twist on the spring bank holiday. Just four days old, the sleepy eyed cubs are seen rolling around these colourful Easter eggs with handler, Kirsty Trusler, at the Lion Park in Johannesburg, South Africa. Ms Trusler, 24, from Lancaster, is responsible for caring for the rare white lion cubs who are two of just 50 in their native country of South Africa. Baby white lion cubs just four days old play with Easter eggs at the Lion Park in Johannesburg, South Africa . The two rare cubs were bred at Johannesburg's Lion Park which specialises in white lions . White Lions are not albinos, but a . genetic rarity unique to the Timbavati region. Like blue eyes in humans, . the animals' white colour is caused by a recessive gene shared by both . parents. The earliest recorded sighting of . white lions in the Timbavati region was in 1938. However, the oral . records of African elders indicate that these unique animals survived in . this region for many centuries. Since their discovery white lions have been hunted, and forcibly removed from their natural endemic habitat. The baby white lions are cared for by Kirsty Trusler (left) at Johannesburg's Lion Park in South Africa . The white lion species is endangered because their light coats make it harder for them to camouflage . The last white lion was seen in the wild in 1994, after which time they were technically extinct in the wild. The survival of white lions has been . attributed by some to their very whiteness meaning they lack the . camouflage of the tawny lions. The Johannesburg Lion Park has specialised in . breeding programmes designed to discourage the inter-breeding of the . white lion and have agreements with other white lion breeders to ensure . genetic integrity. White lions are native to only the . Greater Timbavati region of South Africa, an area characterised by white . sandy riverbeds and long grass scorched pale by the sun. They . are regarded as sacred animals by the people of that region, but after . Europeans 'discovered' them in the 1970s, many were taken from the wild . to captive breeding and hunting operations. These . removals, along with lion culling and trophy hunting of male lions, . depleted the gene pool and the animals have been technically extinct in . the wild for the past 19 years. White lions are native to only the Greater Timbavati region of South Africa, an area with sandy riverbeds and long grass scorched pale by the sun . Snuggle up: The four-day-old white lion cubs are two of just 50 white lions in South Africa . In . their natural habitat, white lions are regarded as 'apex predators', . able to hunt successfully in day and night and take down prey as large . as giraffes. Despite their rarity, white lions are . not yet classified as endangered because biologists still regard them as . ultimately the same as their tawny equivalents. The . Global White Lion Protection Trust is campaigning for white lions to be . recognised as a subspecies of lions, so that they can be protected . under international law. However, . the genetic marker that makes white lions unique has not yet been . identified by scientists and research into the animals is ongoing. The . trust estimates that there are no more than 300 white lions in . existence. In recent years it has reintroduced the animals to a nature . reserve within Greater Timbavati in an effort to eventually reintroduce . the gene to wild lions.","Two four-day-old cubs were photographed in Johannesburg, South Africa .

Fraudsters: Mathew Green, 26, would write brazen character references for girlfriend Anne-Marie Read, 36, while she would claim to be an experienced health care assistant. In fact, her only qualification was in yoga . A couple forged each other’s . references to land jobs in hospitals – then claimed thousands in sick . pay when one pretended to be too stressed to work. Fraudsters Anne-Marie Read and Matthew . Green put patients at risk when they conned their way into care jobs . across the south of England without the right qualifications. The scam was only uncovered when Read, . 36, applied for a third job while still off with ‘stress and anxiety’ from two other posts. Health bosses became suspicious and launched an investigation and the pair, from Southampton, were arrested. Yesterday they were jailed after a . court heard how the only qualifications Read possessed came from a yoga . school. Green, 26, sobbed as he was handed a 12-month prison sentence . for fraud. His crimes breached a suspended sentence he was given for . stealing from a former employer in 2011. Read, 36, also wept as she was given eight months in prison, suspended for 18 months, as well as 100 hours’ unpaid work. Sentencing them, the judge, Recorder . Ann Arnold, said the pair had worked together to expose patients to ‘the . potential of risk’. Portsmouth Crown Court heard how Read . had gone home with ‘stress and anxiety’ just two days after starting at . Gosport War Memorial Hospital in Hampshire – where staff had already . noticed she lacked key skills for her health care assistant post. During . the subsequent three months off she claimed more than £2,300 in wages – . and even asked for extra hardship payments. In the meantime, boyfriend Green wrote . a reference claiming to be her ex-boss so she could secure more work . with the Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust. But again Read went off sick within . days of starting, the court heard. While absent she tried to land a . third job at a hospital in Surrey but was unsuccessful. Brazen: The couple were so confident in their deceit that Read attended just her first two days of a job at Gosport War Memorial Hospital, near Portsmouth, before going off sick with 'stress' for three months . The fraudsters used Read’s mother as a . reference by altering her surname and creating a fake email address and . contact details. Read also lied about studying at the Open University . and Portsmouth University – when her only qualifications actually came . from the British School of Yoga. Green, who had been sacked for poor performance and attendance at another NHS Trust, made a series of job applications. Six failed to get him a post at the . Royal County Hampshire Hospital in Winchester, but one led to employment . with a hospital in Surrey. However, Read had lied in his . reference that she had once been Green’s supervisor as head matron at . the Winchester hospital and the con was uncovered when health bosses . decided to investigate the spurious job application. The pair pleaded guilty in February to a string of fraud charges. Green, who had depression, was said to . have had a ‘traumatic upbringing’ and put on seven stone in weight . while the swindle was being investigated. The couple had also suffered financial . difficulties. Green took out a mortgage of £130,000 on a £136,000 home . in 2006 only for the pair to be evicted in January after the property’s . value plummeted.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 13:15 EST, 28 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:12 EST, 25 March 2013 . Prosecutors today showed jurors a video of accused Zumba prostitute Alexis Wright having sex with a 61-year-old man on a massage table in exchange for $250, while Wright's business partner allegedly watched from his home computer via Skype. The damning evidence, recorded by Wright herself on a camera hidden in a nest of lingerie, shows her negotiating a fee and then collecting a pile of cash after she finishes. Prosecutors argue the Mark Strong, who is on trial for promoting prostitution, was listening in and watching live via Skype during the entire encounter and later discussed booking other johns for Wright - pushing her to sleep with three clients in one day instead of two. Explicit: Prosecutors played a video of Alexis Wright, 30, stripping off and teasing construction workers across the street from her exercise studio . For all to see: The video played for jurors shows Wright stripping out of her towel while standing in the window of her Pure Vida Zumba exercise studio in downtown Kennebunk, Maine . Not guilty: Mark Strong (right) admits he had an affair with Wright and his lawyers concede he may have watched video of her having sex with other men - but they argue he didn't know she was running an alleged prostitution business . In between clients, she discusses her . schedule of clients with a man who is watching through the video . camera. Prosecutors say that man is Strong, according to Seacoast Online. 'I'd like to schedule only two one-hour appointments tomorrow instead of 45,' Wright says, talking to the camera. 'Nice to get three in somehow,” the man's voice says. When Wright says that she has 'school' the next day, the man suggests she 'fit three in today.' Wright says that would be 'pushing it.' The man's voice later asks which clients he should try to book for her. The time stamp on the 36-minute video . shown the jurors, which was seized from Wright's home, corresponds with . the time on 45 Skype video screen shots that were downloaded from Strong's computer, an investigator testified. Seductive: Mark Strong, a married father of two, . allegedly sat at his home computer and watched Alexis Wright have sex . with several men via live-streaming video over Skype . Seacoast Online reports that in other videos, the pair discuss rates and sexual services that Wright offers. Strong, a married father of two, says he funded Wright's exercise . studio with a loan and acted as her business partner. He . also admits that he had an affair with her and his lawyers concede that . he may have watched her online as she had sex with other men. However, his . lawyers argue Strong, a local real estate broker and private . investigator, had no idea Wright was allegedly receiving money for the . sex or that she was running a prostitution business. Prosecutors say the video shows that . Strong not only knew Wright was having sex for money, he was helping her . book and schedule johns. On trial: Strong has pleaded not guilty to 12 charges of promoting prostitution and one count of invasion of privacy . On Wednesday were shown video of the . alleged Zumba prostitute dropping her towel and posing naked in front of . the windows of her Maine exercise studio - the raciest evidence so far . in the trial of Alexis Wright's business partner. Mark Strong's lawyers admit that the . footage, which appears to be amateur porn Wright shot, is shocking, but . they say it has no bearing on the case and that it will only bias the . jury. Jurors also saw about two dozen pictures Strong . captured on his home computer while he watched live Skype broadcasts of . Wright allegedly having sex with johns in her Zumba exercise studio. The grainy video footage played in . court depicts a woman identified at Wright, a 30-year-old single mother, . parading around her Pure Vida Studio wearing nothing but a towel. She . describes how she is trying to get the attention of construction workers . across the street a she stands in front of the windows of her business. 'I’m going to try and get them to . come over and have some fun,' she says as she stands on a chair in full . view of downtown Kennebunk. She drops her towel as she slowly tears a sign off the window. 'He’s taken notice. They’ve both taken notice. And now they’re watching.' Later, she appears to unlock the door a let a man inside, according to Seacoast Online. The 57-year-old faces 12 counts of promotion of prostitution and a single count of invasion of privacy. He has pleaded not guilty. Wright, a 30-year-old single mother, is slated to stand trial in May. She has pleaded not guilty to all charges . Detectives say they recovered 13,000 still images from Strong's computer, many of them sexually explicit pictures that he captured from videos of Wright having sex with alleged johns. Prosecutors initially wanted to show 577 to the jury. 'This is visual surveillance of the prostitution itself,' Deputy District Attorney Justina McGettigan argued, according to the Portland Press-Herald. Defense lawyers strenuously objected before the material was introduced and continued to object after jurors saw the video and the pictures. They say Strong is just a 'voyeur.' 'It . may be Mr. Strong observed the sexual acts of Ms. Wright with other . people, but I don't think it shows promotion of prostitution,' Daniel . Lilley told the judge. 'These are all very sexual acts and very sexual positions.' Jurors also were given sheets with 21,000 text messages that Strong and Wright exchanged  between February 2010 and February 2012. Defense lawyers strenuously objected to the video shown on Wednesday, saying that it did not pertain to allegations to that Strong was involved in the case. On Wednesday, Justice Nancy Mills ruled that the prosecution should show only 100 of the photos to the jury - to illustrate the Wright invited multiple men into her studio for sex on multiple occasions. Wright's alleged clients include wealthy and well-known figures in southern Maine. So far, 18 men have pleaded guilty to paying Wright for sex . The video isn't the only time the jury heard about Wright's escapades involving a towel. Last week, a pizza delivery driver testified that she answered the door in a towel when he delivered spaghetti and meatballs to her. She then dropped the towel and handed him a $40 tip. Witness Dan Racaniello said he felt that Wright was 'coming on to him' and that he resisted her urgings. Wright . kept meticulous records, prosecutors say, and her list of clients - . many of whom have admitted to charges of patronizing a prostitute - . include well-known lawyers, businessmen and politicians from across . southern Maine. Wright has pleaded not guilty to charges of prostitution and invasion of privacy. Her trial is scheduled for May.","Mark Strong, the business partner for Alexis Wright, is on trial facing charges of promoting prostitution .

A Romanian pickpocket who duped coffee shop customers by using sheets of lined paper as a 'shield' while he stole their phones was behind bars today. Calin-Lonel Rostas, 27, would trawl cafes and whenever he spotted a mobile phone left on table would put a A4 size piece of paper over it. He then distracted the owners of the phones by chatting them momentarily about the weather before using his light fingers to sneak the handsets into his pocket as he picked up his piece of paper. Victims only realised their phones were missing after Rostas left the cafe following his 'gone in five seconds' distraction thefts. Rostas got away with at least 15 mobile phones worth £6,000, but was caught after police trawled through hours of CCTV footage at coffee shops in Manchester including Starbucks, Costa Coffee, Cafe Nero and two cafes in the city’s university district. When he was caught it emerged he had just been released from jail for a similar scam. Today Romanian-born Rostas, now living in Crumpsall, Manchester was jailed for 20 months. He pleaded guilty to 15 thefts and five attempted thefts, involving four mobile phones and an iPad and was said to have a history of carrying out 13 cons dating back to 2002. Manchester Crown Court was told Rostas targeted coffee shops and takeaway restaurants in Manchester city centre and south Manchester between December last year and February. This CCTV footage shows Rostas attempting to steal mobile phones by covering them with paper . In most cases Rostas would distract his victims by placing a paper over their mobile and then begin talking to them. He would then leave, taking his paper and the victim's mobile phone . He was eventually arrested after he tried to dupe students sat drinking coffee outside McDonalds on Oxford Road. In statements given to police, victims were said to have been left 'scared and upset.' One woman became distrusting, others blamed themselves and one victim suffered university exam disruption as a result of the theft. Some of the pieces of paper Rostas used had writing of them, and he also used leaflets and posed as a beggar asking for cash. Rostas said he sold the phones to cover gambling debts. The handsets have never been recovered. Police have revealed reports of similar thefts involving the same trick across Greater Manchester, with one similar theft being recently reported at a pub in Prestwich, near Bury. In statements given to police, Rosta's victims were said to have been left 'scared and upset' One woman became distrusting, others blamed themselves and one victim suffered university exam disruption as a result of the thefts . Passing sentence the Judge Miss Recorder Rowena Goode said; 'These thefts were planned and co-ordinated. No soon as you are released from prison you go out and commit exactly the same offences again. 'Your pattern of offending seems to demonstrates that you have no intention whatsoever to alter your views.' Police said Rostas was seen with two men on a number of occasions and officers have how issued CCTV stills of the two suspects. After the case Det Chief Insp Colin Larkin, of Greater Manchester Police said: 'Rostas is a skilled fraudster who is well versed in deception, he managed to con 15 victims and stole their mobile phones. 'He has been sentenced to 20 months in prison, on a number of occasions he was seen with two other men. If you recognise either of the men please get in touch as soon as possible. 'While it should be safe for us all to put our phones and other belongings next to us on a table while we enjoy a drink or bite to eat, the reality is that there are people out there looking to take advantage of those less security conscious than others. 'It only takes seconds for them to strike and they are gone before you even realise your treasured possession is missing. 'There are some simple steps people can take to prevent them from falling victim to this type of crime and I want to get these messages into the public’s psyche.

A teenage girl was raped by two men on a double decker bus after leaving a shopping centre with her friend. The 14-year-old was attacked on the top deck of the 57 bus as it left Silverburn shopping centre in Pollok, Glasgow. When the girls got on the bus, they took a seat downstairs. The victim went to the upper deck where she got into a conversation with two men who boarded the bus in the city centre. The two girls got onto a number 57 bus which was leaving Silverburn shopping centre in Pollok, Glasgow . She was then assaulted and raped by both of them. Her friend, also 14, went up to see her and raised the alarm with passengers downstairs. A woman and two men came to the girls’ aid. They all left the bus two stops along from Silverburn. The passengers are said to have waited with them until they got another bus home, thought to be in the Darnley area of the city, where police were contacted. The incident took palce at around 10.30pm on Friday, March 22. No CCTV footage is available from the bus while Strathclyde Police are appealing for those passengers to come forward to help their investigation. Both of the attackers are said to be aged around 18 to 20. One is about 5ft 10ins, with a shaved head and wearing a black jumper. The other man has brown, spiky hair and was wearing a tracksuit which may have been grey, with a body warmer or jacket. Detective Constable Jackie Carroll, from Greater Glasgow CID, said: 'This was a very frightening experience for the young girl concerned and, thankfully, she was assisted by her friend and the good samaritans on the bus who ensured she got home safely. 'She has been left traumatised by her ordeal. We’re continuing extensive inquiries into the incident and would like to trace two men and a woman who came to her assistance as they will have vital information which could help with our investigation. 'We know that the men responsible boarded the bus in the city centre. The men were very loud and using crude and lewd comments to other passengers. Ordeal: The two attackers eventually got off the number 57 First Glasgow bus in the city centre (file photo) 'The bus driver ejected the two men from the bus at Pollokshaws Road (near Queen’s Park) around 12.30am. 'I would like to speak to anyone who may have been present on the bus at the time of the attack, as it is imperative we trace these men.' A spokesman for First Glasgow said the driver of the bus did not see the incident. He told STV Glasgow: 'We are assisting the police with their investigation and would echo their appeal for anyone to come forward who may have information about the incident. 'Our driver was not aware of the assault. Unfortunately, the incident took place on the top deck of the bus and therefore out of our driver's eyeline and no-one on board approached our driver to report a disturbance. 'The driver ejected the two males in question sometime later in the journey - this was due to separate unruly behaviour. 'The safety and security of our staff and passengers is our number one priority and we will continue to do everything we can to help the police apprehend the perpetrators.' 'Our thoughts are very much with the victim of the assault,' he added.","Victim attacked after leaving Silverburn shopping centre in Glasgow .

Smiles: Giuseppe Morello (pictured), 43, began an affair with the woman, a 47-year old widow, after the death of her husband . A teaching assistant had to get police to restrain her ‘insatiable’ lover after she dumped him for being too demanding in the bedroom. The 47-year-old mother of three, who was looking for love after the death of her husband, began a whirlwind romance with Italian waiter Giuseppe Morello, 43. But she broke off their passionate affair because she grew tired of the pressure  to have sex with him ‘morning, noon  and night’. Morello was devastated by the split and tried to win her back. He bombarded her with as many as 20 texts a day, telling her: ‘My life is over without you.’ He also turned up at the school where she worked and tried to woo her in front of the staff and pupils. Eventually police had to step in to stop his Casanova campaign. Morello struck up a relationship with the unnamed woman last  September, after he served her at the Ciao Baby Italian restaurant in Egerton, near Bolton. After the first few weeks of the relationship they even rented a house . together.  However, she soon noticed that he was ‘possessive and . clingy’. Neil White, prosecuting, told Blackburn magistrates’ court: . ‘It turned into a situation when he was extremely possessive, jealous . and arguments occurred. She felt pressured by him to have sexual . intercourse every night, and then in the mornings, and afternoons as . well. She felt she couldn’t meet his sexual demands. ‘She ended the relationship after six weeks because of the constant pressure to go to bed with him. ‘He began to text and phone and pester her, telling her how much he loved her. ‘He . continued to be controlling and possessive, and there were constant . demands for sex, with him sulking whenever she refused.’ The police were called in last November after the couple had a blazing row. They removed Morello from the house and warned him not to come back or contact her again. He . also received a caution for assault. ‘After that she received in excess . of 20 text messages a day and countless phone calls,’ said  Mr White. ‘She . ignored these but he also turned up outside her home. And, on a couple . of occasions, he was outside the school where  she works as a teaching . assistant and tried to engage her in conversation.’ Ciao Baby: Morello had struck up a relationship with the mother-of-three last September after he served her at the Ciao Baby Restaurant, in Egerton, near Bolton . Police decided . to arrest Morello in February when he turned up at the woman’s house – . while officers were there taking her statement. Yesterday Morello admitted  harassment, and was told not to contact his former lover under the terms of a restraining order. He will also have to complete 200 hours of unpaid work, as well as paying £145 in costs and a victim surcharge. In . mitigation his lawyer, Damian Pickup, said: ‘He accepts that he . bombarded her with text messages and phone calls, but these were not . threatening. All he wanted to do was tell her how much he loved her and . ask if there was a way back for them. He was simply declaring his . undying love and seeking answers to what was going on between them. ‘He says it was the language of love and nothing more.’ But district judge Peter Ward told him: ‘Bombarding someone with text messages, even saying “I love you” is harassment. ‘It takes two people to be in a relationship. ‘I’m . prepared to accept that the text messages were not particularly . threatening. Nevertheless, it is harassment because she didn’t want this . relationship to continue.’","Giuseppe Morello, 43, began affair with the widow, 47, after husband's death .

Lovesick Romeo: Ben Robbins, 24, of Baldock, Bedfordshire was sentenced at Luton Magistrates Court after admitting stalking his ex Tania Malin . A lovesick Romeo was branded a stalker today after his desperate attempts to use flowers and snowballs to win back an ex-girlfriend earned him community service. Ben Robbins, 24, climbed a ladder to Tania Maylin's window, leapt on her car bonnet to stop her driving away and put flowers on her windscreen. However, Ms Maylin, terrified by Robbins' obsession with her, had no intention of rekindling their relationship. She told police that Robbins had also threatened to kill any new boyfriend she got and offered her friends cash for her phone number after she changed it to avoid his calls. Robbins admitted he was 'off his head' when he harassed his ex-girlfriend and her friends, paying visits to their homes, making phone calls and sending text messages. Nevertheless, his barrister refuted comparisons with the film Fatal Attraction. Robbins, of Baldock, Hertfordshire, admitted a single charge under the new Protection from Harassment Act. It is the first conviction of its kind under the new law, which was amended on November 25 last year to make stalking a specific offence in England and Wales . Magistrates handed him a two-year community order, including compulsory attendance on a domestic abuse programme, and 80 hours of unpaid work. He must also pay £85 in court costs and a £60 victim surcharge. Miss Maylin, in a letter to the court, said her former boyfriend's behaviour had annoyed and frightened her, but that she was a firm believer of people making 'stupid mistakes' being given a second chance. The victim, also 24, went even further, asking that a restraining order should not be imposed as she wanted to remain in contact with Robbins. Prosecutor Shahida Parveen told magistrates yesterday how Robbins and Miss Maylin had been in a relationship for about 12 months, until early this year. 'The complainant says she ended the relationship due to this defendant's controlling nature,' she said. 'He had been going through her phone to see who she had been messaging and calling her friends to see where she was. 'He even took a photo of her work rota to know when she was working.' After she broke up with him on January 15, Robbins took to sending her messages, via text and on Facebook. When Miss Maylin changed her phone number he asked a mutual friend for the new one and continued the harassment. One day, after turning up at Miss Maylin's home in Arlesey, Bedfordshire, and being told to leave by her mother, he threw snowballs at her window to get her attention. 'Police were called. He was now up a ladder, put up against the complainant's window and was looking in,' said the prosecutor. On Valentine's Day he sent her a card 'begging her to come back' and a week later was back at her home, throwing stones at her window, before later sending her a clipping of his dreadlocks and leaving a rose on her car. The court heard that earlier this month he sent a text message to a friend saying he was going to kill himself, only to appear at Miss Maylin's home again the next day. 'On one occasion he offered a friend of hers £200 pounds for her new mobile phone number,' said Ms Parveen. 'He started saying he would kill any new boyfriend of hers. He was pretending to be someone else on the phone and was asking her out for a drink on Facebook, and was questioning her about any other cars parked next to her car.' Harassment: Robbins continually turned up at Miss Maylin's home, climbed a ladder to her window, sent her clippings of his dreadlocks, left flowers on her car - and threatened to kill any new lover she met . Miss Maylin told Luton magistrates in her witness impact statement that her former boyfriend's behaviour had so frightened her that she would check her car every time she used it in case he had done something to it. She would constantly look over her shoulder and her colleagues would walk her from the building when she left work. She said: 'I know he gets drugged-up and drives around asking for me. I just want to get on with my life.' Andy Corcutt, defending, said in . mitigation: 'This is the case of a young man in his first relationship, . with a significant drug problem, going over the top. 'The lock of hair and the flower on the car are very clichéd. 'The defendant is mortified.' He said his client was now drug-free and that 'something of a light' had switched on in his head and that he now understood the impact of his actions on Miss Maylin. 'This is not the sort of case of the Fatal Attraction type. This is not a case of physical violence towards this lady,' he said. Presiding magistrate Barry Neale told the defendant: 'We heard Miss Maylin's description of what all this had done to her. 'She just wanted to get on with her life and you didn't let her. The bench feels you should get on with your life, grow up and show a bit of maturity.'","Ben Robbins threatened to kill any new boyfriend of his ex Tania Maylin .

Still striking: NUT's Christine Blower, pictured last year, warned that teachers strikes will go ahead . Teachers have agreed plans to strike over pay and pensions the day after Michael Gove wrote to unions insisting the issues were 'fixed'. Both the Education Secretary and the teachers' unions have refused to back down from the stalemate. At the National Union of Teachers annual conference, general secretary Christine Blower said: 'We are not rowing back... We have put these reasonable demands and we want to talk to him about them, not just have him send us a letter.' Her comments in Liverpool yesterday came after Mr Gove wrote to unions saying he was willing to meet but the 'direction of travel' on key issues was 'fixed'. The NUT and National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers last week announced rolling strikes from June 27, with a national walkout before Christmas. Speaking at the NUT annual conference in Liverpool today, general secretary Christine Blower warned Mr Gove that the unions stand firm in their position. This week, Mr Gove wrote to the NUT and the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers (NASUWT) to say he was willing to meet the unions to discuss the issues, but insisting that the ‘direction of travel’ on both pensions and pay is ‘fixed’. Ms Blower said: ‘Negotiation is about sitting across the table having an exchange and listening to people. ‘What he’s saying is pay and pensions are done and dusted, and there’s no reason to talk about it. That’s not our view.’ The unions put a list of demands to Mr Gove, calling on him to suspend the introduction of performance-related pay, due to be brought in later this year, and to publish an evaluation of the Teachers’ Pension Scheme. They also wanted him to ‘commit to genuine engagement’ by setting up a series of meetings to discuss the dispute. In his letter to the unions, Mr Gove said he would be ‘very happy’ to meet them, but he warned: ‘While I am happy to discuss any issue you have, I shall stress in advance that on changes to teachers’ pension and pay arrangements, the direction of travel is now fixed. No change: Education Secretary Michael Gove told the NUT and NASUWT that the Government's plans for teachers' pensions and pay will go ahead . Collective action: The strike will begin in the North West in June with further walkouts to follow during the autumn term with a national strike in December . ‘In both cases, there has been full consultation with trade unions including the NASUWT and the NUT.’ In her response to the letter, NASUWT general secretary Chris Keates said: ‘This is a serious situation which requires a more measured response than this display of arrogance and belligerence from the Secretary of State. ‘As far as we are concerned we remain committed to engaging in genuine discussions and our original demands still remain on the table.’ Delegates at the NUT’s annual conference are expected to debate a priority motion today confirming the union’s plan for industrial action with the NASUWT. Money woes: The two main reasons for the teacher walkout are the Government's controversial public sector pension reforms and plans to introduce performance-related pay (file photo) Ms Blower said ‘While it is entirely possible for members to seek to amend the priority motion, the purpose of the motion is to go forward from conference with a ringing endorsement of the strategy with the NASUWT.’ She also rounded on Mr Gove for previously calling his critics ‘enemies of promise’. ‘I think people were astonished when Michael Gove used the expression ‘enemies of promise’. ‘It seemed to teachers whom I have talked to about it that he has no idea what goes on in schools up and down the country. ‘If you’ve ever been into a primary or secondary school on a normal working day, you will find teachers working extremely hard, even in the face of Government interventions, and children being taught incredibly interesting and exciting lessons.’","NUT and NASUWT plan rolling programme of regional strikes from June .

A helicopter immediately flew over the scene of the accident at Grand Montets and two rescuers were winched down into the crevasse. But the man was already dead. (File picture) A rescue crew of the Securite Civile (emergency services) flies over Chamonix, in the French Alps. A Brit was found dead there yesterday . It is believed the man had snowboarded over a snow bridge on the Rognon glacier and it had collapsed under his weight. The man lived in Passy, 10 miles from Chamonix, and was snowboarding alone but had been due to meet friends later that day. A police spokesman said: 'When we arrived the victim was already dead. He probably died instantly from the fall.' A snow bridge is formed by a snow drift. It is an arc that can grow to join the sides of a crevasse crating an illusion of a solid surface. It hides the opening under a layer of snow of unknown thickness. File picture showing a snowboarder at La Flegere, Chamonix, near where the British expat was found . A snow bridge is thicker and stronger at the edge of a crevasse meaning that a fall though a bridge usually happens at some distance from the crevasse edge. The accident is the latest tragedy involving a Briton in the Alps. Earlier this month, in the same resort, a father and son died after falling down a steep gully. Peter Saunders, 48, and his 12-year-old son Charlie were hiking in Chamonix. Police believe Mr Saunders fell to his death while trying to rescue his son who had fallen 1000 feet.

Tanning salons are routinely flouting regulations designed to protect customers against skin cancer, an investigation reveals. Some are using sunbeds that emit rays four times above the legal limit of radiation. Inspectors found more than 70 per cent of the sunbeds they tested were set above the limit, with compliance in one area standing at just 6 per cent. Dangerous: Many British salons are setting sunbeds too high to give their customers instant results . It is thought many salons set the beds at a higher level in a bid to guarantee their customers an instant tan. In Britain, the legal limit for UV ray emissions is 0.3 watts per square metre – the equivalent of the midday sun in the southern Mediterranean. Some of the sunbeds tested emitted up to 1.2 watts – a level which does not naturally occur anywhere on Earth. Experts warned that exposure to such emissions could multiply the risk of developing skin cancer. The findings were uncovered by Trading Standards teams across the UK in a crackdown on dangerous practices. Clare Forbes, an officer in West Yorkshire, said: ‘The failures we have found are quite shocking. Tests have been carried out up and down the country and found really low levels of compliance. Risk: If anyone has been to a strong sunbed they should consult a GP, a trading standards officer said . ‘I don’t think people realise the extent of the risk they are exposing themselves to. ‘We are talking about skin cancer – not a bit of sunburn. If anyone thinks they have been on a strong sunbed they should report it to us or consult their GP.’ The tests were carried out by inspectors wearing protective clothing while taking the readings with a radiation meter. The probe was launched after complaints from customers and tip-offs from other tanning operators that some were flouting the rules so they could provide quicker tans. Tests on scores of sunbeds across Essex, Suffolk, West Yorkshire and Newcastle showed a worrying number were emitting 1.2 watts – four times the limit. The establishments causing most concern were dedicated tanning salons and operations linked to hairdressers and nail bars. In Newcastle, only 16 per cent of the 60 sunbeds tested complied with the regulations. Skin cancer: Donna Ballantyne died after using sunbeds at an unsupervised coin-operated tanning salon in Glasgow . Donna Ballantyne died from skin cancer after using sunbeds from the age of 16. The mother of three used coin-operated tanning booths for 20 minutes at a time, twice a week. Although she stopped using them regularly when she got married at 22, by 30 she had developed skin cancer. She died aged 39 after a nine-year fight against the disease, which saw her develop at least 19 tumours. Speaking to the Mail in 2011, Mrs Ballantyne said that she was never warned how strong the UV light was. She said: ‘The sunbeds were unmanned, which meant there was no one there to advise me how long to go on for or how powerful the tubes were. I would insert my money into the machine and lie there for as long as I liked. ‘I often burnt my back and shoulders, but I thought that was the aim because the skin would later turn brown.’ The hotel manager, from Bothwell, Lanarkshire, said at the time: ‘If I could turn back the clock, I wouldn’t have spent even one second on a sunbed.’ In Essex, where 85 beds were tested and only 6 per cent complied with the limits, nine beds were emitting 1.2 watts. A similar picture was emerging  in West Yorkshire and Suffolk, where tests were being carried out this week. In Wakefield, 72 per cent of sunbeds failed to meet regulations, while in Bradford 80 per cent failed. Gary Lipman, chairman of The Sunbed Association, said: ‘We have been blazing the trail for 0.3 compliance right from the outset, training and working with Trading Standards and Environmental Health offices throughout the UK. ‘The picture is changing daily but more needs to be done. Many local authorities aren’t testing compliance, and this must change.’ The legal limit across Europe is now 0.3 watts per square metre of tanning bed after it was reduced from 0.6 because of growing health concerns. A further reduction is on the cards because of fears that the current levels could still pose a skin cancer threat.","Tanning salons are setting sunbeds dangerously high for instant results .

The brother of double-amputee athlete Oscar Pistorius went on trial in a South African court today over the death of a woman in a road collision in 2008. Carl Pistorius, who faces a charge of culpable homicide, or negligent killing, wore a dark suit and was accompanied by his sister, Aimee. In Britain, the equivalent charge to culpable homicide is manslaughter. Oscar Pistorius, who was charged with murdering his girlfriend on Valentine's Day, was not present. Scroll down for video . In the dock: Carl Pistorius (pictured during his brother Oscar's court hearing last month) has gone on trial over the death of a female motorcyclist in March 2008 . The Olympian hasn't been seen in public since he was granted bail at Pretoria Magistrate's Court on February 22. His lawyers plan to challenge his bail restrictions on Thursday. Initial proceedings in Carl Pistorius' case at Vanderbijlpark Magistrate's Court, south of Johannesburg, focused on a request by South Africa's national broadcaster, SABC, to show the trial proceedings live on national television or record them for later use. Magistrate Buks du Plessis said reporters could attend the trial, but turned down the SABC request, saying he wanted to guard against 'emotional hype' and that any public interest in the trial stemmed only from the intense interest in the murder case against Oscar Pistorius. News photographers were not allowed to cover the trial while it was in session. 'He's not a celebrity in his own right,' du Plessis said of Oscar's brother. Addressing Carl Pistorius, the magistrate then said: 'Apologies to you, sir.' Carl Pistorius smiled and nodded.

Brotherly love: Carl Pistorius (centre) stands with his father Henke (right) behind Oscar Pistorius during the Blade Runner's bail hearing . Defense lawyer Kenneth Oldwadge said the legal team for Oscar Pistorius had been 'overwhelmed by the media,' and that similar press scrutiny would make it difficult to work in court during the older brother's case. Oldwadge cited a comment by the judge in Oscar Pistorius' bail hearing that the media treated the athlete like some kind of unusual 'species' instead of a human being. Prosecutors say Carl Pistorius was driving an SUV in March 2008 when he collided with a female motorcyclist. The woman, Marietjie Barnard, died in a hospital. Although the culpable homicide charge against Carl was initially dropped, it was reinstated this year after forensic evidence and reports from the accident scene became available, according to prosecutors. Legal battle continues: Oscar Pistorius (pictured with Miss Steenkamp) plans to challenge his bail restrictions on Thursday which prevent him from travelling outside of South Africa . The Pistorius family said last month that Carl deeply regretted the incident, but insisted it was a 'tragic accident.' He was not under the influence of alcohol, the family said. Oscar's legal team filed an appeal against some of his bail conditions on March 7, objecting to him not being allowed to travel outside of South Africa even though a magistrate said he was not a flight risk when granting him 1 million rand ($108,000) bail. They're also challenging an alcohol ban and a ruling that Pistorius cannot speak with residents at the gated estate where he shot girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp dead in the early hours of Valentine's Day. The athlete denies murdering Steenkamp and says he shot her by mistake, fearing an intruder was in his home. Prosecutors say he killed her intentionally following an argument. Oscar Pistorius must appear in court again on June 4.","Carl Pistorius is charged with culpable homicide or negligent killing .

A council has come under fire for employing two 'grammar tsars' on £50,000 each to help primary school teachers learn the answers to a new English test - for 10-year-olds. Kent County Council has employed two 'literacy consultants' to tutor primary school teachers ahead of a new grammar test for pupils aged 10 and 11 in June this year. Hundreds of teachers across the county have already taken part in 'Confidence with English Grammar, Punctuation and Spelling' courses, to 'consolidate' their knowledge of the language. So Bobby, what's a subordinate connective? Kent County Council has employed two 'literacy consultants' to tutor primary school teachers ahead of a new grammar test for pupils. (Picture posed by models) But critics say the teachers should already have a grasp of basic English. The new tests have been designed to be 'more demanding' on pupils and are believed to test children on 'more than just basic grammar' - which prompted the council to employ two 'experts' on a two year contract. The so-called 'literacy consultants' started work in August last year and will continue until August 2014, earning between £51,000 and £54,000 each. Chrissie Maher OBE, the founder of the Plain English Campaign, said that teachers should already have a firm knowledge of grammar without the need for the 'tsars'. She said: 'It's good for the kids, but bad if their English teachers don't know basic English. 'If they're not up to scratch they shouldn't be there - they should've been getting retrained. 'Grammar is a big issue and it's bad these kids are being taught everyday grammar if the teachers don't know what they're talking about.' Some headteachers and ex-heads, however, said that it was 'too much' to teach kids 'complex grammar'. Derry Wiltshire, head teacher of the outstanding-rated Amherst School in Riverhead, Kent, said: 'I think all children should learn basic grammar and should know it by the time they leave primary school, but teaching them what a subordinate connective is is absolutely bonkers.' Peter Cornish, the former head teacher at St Matthew's Primary School in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, said he thought some teachers would 'find it difficult' to got back to class. He said: 'It wouldn't surprise me if they (the teachers) didn't know some of the intricacies (of grammar). 'I think back when I was educated you knew a lot of the grammar because that's what we were taught at the time, but when you went to teacher training college it was hardly ever mentioned.' A spokesman for Kent County Council said this week: 'The course aims to consolidate teachers' subject knowledge and their understanding of the test content and format. 'It also offers practical advice on how to teach these elements of English. 'As with every part of the teaching profession, continued professional development is crucial for maintaining the high standards of teaching that every child deserves and every parent expects.'","Kent County Council employs two 'literacy consultants' to tutor teachers .

A devious carer stole more than £13,000 from a 92-year-old deaf man she was supposed to be looking after, a court heard. Mother-of-one Kelly Day, 38, systematically drained John Filmer's bank account while working for Tender Loving Carers in Kent. Mr Filmer, of Whitstable, Kent who appeared in the witness box in his wheelchair, told the court he thought Kent County Council had been taking the cash. Stolen money: A jury at Canterbury Crown Court heard how Day had been taking the cash from his bank account while looking after John Filmer . But a jury at Canterbury Crown Court heard yesterday how Day had been taking the cash from his bank account while looking after the pensioner. Day was caught slipping the bank card into Mr Filmer's wallet, pretending she was returning cash from a shopping trip. She later admitted to stealing £300, claiming she could not pay her rent arrears and feared eviction - but claimed it was the only occasion. But what she did not know was the wallet had already been checked by a police officer and social services staff who had become suspicious of money disappearing. Day, who worked for TLC, which is based in Kent and supplies domiciliary carers to disabled and vulnerable clients, was sacked immediately. Carer: Day was working for Tender Loving Carers in Kent at the time of the offence . She was found guilty of the second theft and will be sentenced for both matters next month - after being told by Judge Simon James to expect a custodial sentence. Prosecutor Ian Foinette said Day, who . was on a rota of carers looking after the pensioner, took thousands of . pounds without his knowledge. He . said to Day: 'So it was just coincidence was it, that May 21 was the . only day you took money and the only day a police officer and social . services happened to be there? 'You were effectively caught red-handed and you knew the game was up. 'It had been an ideal opportunity for you to take Mr Filmer's card that morning and help yourself to £300 and slip it (the card) back in a bit later. 'The money which disappeared was £13,200 which, had he been given it as Day claimed, he would have been awash with cash.' Day claimed she had been evicted a number of years ago and feared she would lose her home again if she didn't pay her rent arrears in the home where she has lived for 17 years. The carer claimed Mr Filmer had given her his bank card and she had made the withdrawals over the year - in defiance of her company's policy - but said it was with his permission. She told the jury the money was used to pay for shopping and buying clothing items - sometimes taking out hundreds of pounds. She also claimed he gave her a set of keys to let herself into his home. The carer claimed on numerous occasions she had failed to fill out a financial transaction form which was required by the company. Day, giving evidence said: 'I saw an opportunity and I took it and I've admitted it. 'I didn't know a police officer would be there when I went round that day. 'I had every intention to pay the £300 back.' Day was granted bail until the next hearing. Tender Loving Carers managing director Brigitte Grutzmacher said: 'We have no tolerance with any person who may pose a possible risk of abuse in any form to any of our clients. 'Our company has supported and helped the police fully with all their enquiries. The client in question is still using our services which is a testament to the company proving that we put the client first.'","Kelly Day, 38, was supposed to be looking after John Filmer but drained his bank account of money .

An elderly woman died in a horrific multi-vehicle motorway crash today, just hours after the Bank Holiday rush got under way. The tragedy closed the east-bound carriageway of the M62, near Huddersfield, leading to 13 miles of tailbacks, as a major 999 operation swung into action. Paramedics aboard the Yorkshire Air Ambulance touched down but the woman died before she could be taken on board despite frantic efforts to save her life.

Most main roads had only minor delays, as many chose to stay at home this Easter because of the bad weather . An air ambulance spokesman said: . 'According to the paramedic an elderly lady was ejected from a vehicle . and they were unfortunately unable to save her. 'She passed away. She was certified dead at the scene. There were arm injuries. It was quite a traumatic incident.' Eye-witnesses said a van was coming down a hill near Junction 24 of the motorway when both tyres apparently blew out. The van cannoned into the central reservation, hurling the rear seat female passenger out into the carriageway. People depart for sunnier climates at Glasgow Airport this morning. The airport is expecting 75,000 people through its terminals over the 4-day Easter weekend, up 0.7 percent on the Easter weekend 2012 .

A father who tried to stop a shop from selling a legal high to his troubled teenage daughter ended up being arrested after losing his temper with staff. Colin Rawlingson was worried about the health of his 17-year-old daughter Nicole after she confessed she had become addicted to the drug Sky High, which gave her terrifying mood swings. So on Tuesday he went to the shop where she said she had bought to the drug in an attempt to persuade staff to stop selling the legal high to the underage girl. Every parent's nightmare: Nicole Rawlingson, 17, is addicted to legal drug Sky High . But when he raised his voice at workers in the shop in Aberdeen he was apparently targeted by security guards who forced him to the ground. Police then attended the scene and arrested the father of three, handing him an on-the-spot fine of £40 for shouting at staff. Mr Rawlingson, 62, said he was horrified to find himself painted in a bad light when he was trying to protect his vulnerable daughter. 'We've been trying to find out for a long time what has been the catalyst of her extreme behaviour,' he said. 'She told us she had been taking this substance because she was unable to purchase alcohol or cigarettes from local shops because of her age - she only looks about 12. Arrest: After Colin Rawlingson (right) filmed Nicole buying the drug in Aberdeen (left) he was detained by police . 'To prove the point we went to the shop to see if they would sell it to her. My daughter's carer filmed it on her mobile phone. 'The shop staff never asked for ID and she was just given the product. When I started complaining about this, I raised my voice. 'The next thing I know these two security guards pushed me to the ground.' The recruitment executive said the men lay on top of him for 15 minutes while waiting for police to arrive after they had thrown him face-down on the floor. 'My daughter was going berserk at this point,' Mr Rawlingson said. 'She was terrified - and so was I. 'I could hardly breathe and I thought at one point I was going to die. Mood swings: The teenager has been behaving increasingly erratically since taking the drug . While the exact make-up of the drug sold as 'Sky High' is unclear due to its semi-legal status, it appears to be a synthetic cannabinoid similar to the drug 'Spice'. Such substances imitate the effects of marijuana, relaxing users and giving them a 'trippy' sensation, although they do not contain any of the same ingredients as the natural drug. Users have described Sky High as 'very, very potent', far more powerful than ordinary strains of cannabis. The drug has not been specifically outlawed under current anti-narcotic legislation, but cannot be advertised for human consumption. Similar substances are usually marketed as 'herbal blends', and are sometimes specifically labelled as being unsuitable for ingestion. 'Then the police arrived and put handcuffs on me and took me into a police van in full view of everyone on the street. 'I've . never had any trouble with police. I didn't assault anyone - I just . raised my voice as anyone would have done as a concerned parent.' Mr Rawlingson said that his daughter had been behaving increasingly erratically over the preceding months - and had even tried to run away from home. The teenager has kicked in walls and ripped panels off doors at her family home in Blackburn, near Aberdeen, and her panic attacks mean she can no longer sleep on her own. Nicole's family had no idea what was triggering her mood swings until she admitted she had been regularly smoking the synthetic cannabis drug over the past year. It is sold in a clear tube labelled 'Sky High', with no indication of what the product actually contains. 'Because it is a legal high she thinks it's OK,' Mr Rawlingson said. 'She's been taking it two or three times a week for a year. 'If they are going to sell legal highs they should come with health warnings. But I think these shops need to be closed down.'","Nicole Rawlingson, 17, has been behaving erratically since taking Sky High .

Take aim: Former Tucson Mayoral Candidate Shaun McClusky supports a program that will give free shotguns to residents of high-crime areas of Tucson . A program to hand out weapons in high-crime areas in the same town where Gabrielle Giffords and 18 others were shot has caused sharp criticism from gun control advocates. The Armed Citizens Project was backed by former Tucson, Arizona mayoral candidate Shaun McClusky, a Republican, who said that he wants to have at least 36 people in these neighborhoods armed with shotguns and trained in the next two months. It is controversial in no small part because Tucson is the city where Rep Gabrielle Giffords was severely wounded in a 2011 shooting spree that left six people, including a nine-year-old girl, dead. The Republican told FoxNews.com that all of the reviews he’s heard of the program have been positive, and that he’s raised more than $12,000 already. He’s offering the single-shot shotguns to anyone who lives in mid-to-high-risk neighborhoods and can pass a background check, and is hoping to focus on high-crime areas like Midvale Park, Pueblo Gardens, and the Grant-Campbell area, which he said is ‘rampant’ with break-ins. The guns themselves cost around $200, while training, ammunition, and cleaning supplies would run the cost up to around $350 per person, per gun. To arms: The Armed Citizen Project seeks to provide free single-shot shotguns to those who pass background checks and receive training . ‘Right now, the criminal element is winning,’ he said, according to the Arizona Daily Star. But Mr McClusky’s views are deeply unpopular with state politicians. ‘To suggest that giving away…loaded shotguns in high-crime areas will make anybody safer is pure idiocy,’ councilman Steve Kozachik said, according to the Star. ‘(The Republican party) is totally out of touch with the values of this city.’ The councilman said that background checks would do little to keep these weapons out of the wrong hands, and would contribute to violence in crime-ravaged areas. Councilwoman Regina Romero agreed, saying that Mr McClusky’s assessment of some of Tucson’s neighborhoods is ‘stereotyping.’ She told the Star: ‘McClusky…is reckless in promoting such a ridiculous idea. If he wants to hand out guns to people, why doesn’t he hand them out around the neighborhood?’ In remembrance: Former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and her husband Mark Kelly pictured earlier this month at the Tucson shooting site . Memorial: Days after the 2011 shooting, a makeshift memorial was set up to honor the six people, including a nine-year-old girl, who were shot dead . The Armed Citizens Project was founded by Kyle Coplen, a University of Houston graduate student, who defends the initiative. ‘We’re not just tossing a bunch of shotguns into a community and walking away,’ he said. ‘What we’re doing is finding residents who are interested in protecting themselves.’ He added that there are plans to expand the project to other cities, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, Dallas, and Indianapolis. Two years ago, then Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was making an appearance at a Safeway for a meet-and-greet event when gunman Jared Lee Loughner opened fire on the event. Loughner killed six people, including nine-year-old Christina-Taylor Green. First responders: Rep Giffords is seen on a stretcher on January 8, 2011, moments after she was shot in the head . Rep. Giffords was shot at point-blank range in the head, but miraculously survived the shooting. After two years of intensive care and physical therapy, the former congresswoman still struggles with speech and movement. She and her husband, retired astronaut Mark Kelly, have launched an initiative called the Americans for Responsible Solutions, demanding harsher gun control laws in the wake of other mass shootings such as last summer’s Aurora theater shooting and December’s Sandy Hook massacre. According to neighborhoodscout.com, Tucson has 3,492 violent crimes every year, with nearly 30,000 property crimes, or around 6.64 crimes per 1,000 residents. Arizona State University professor Travis Pratt, who teaches criminology, told the Star that study after study has shown that guns have only succeeded in increasing crimes. ‘There is no credible evidence at all that providing a high-crime area with the instruments to facilitate more crime is going to have any net social benefits,’ he said. Crime and punishment: Certain areas of Tucson have alarmingly high crime rates, but some experts say that gun ownership will not solve that .","Former Tucson mayoral candidate Shaun McClusky backing Armed Citizens Project, whose aim is to give people in high-crime neighborhoods .

Mr Beeharry, 48, and Ms Ibanez-Mahiques, 53, had struggled to attract residents to their homes, but there were still 35 people living at Marina-Helena at the time of their death. The week before they committed suicide, the pair told the council they would have to shut down their business. 'They were devastated about the business,' said care home manager Lisa Farr, who worked for the couple for 12 years. Desperate: The pair were about to announce the closure of one of the care homes they operated . Doomed: The Maria-Helena home in Spalding, Lincolnshire was scheduled to shut down . 'I first noticed a change in Mr Beeharry earlier on in the year, identifying those problems as depression. 'He told me as I drove him to the car home the day before he was found that he was due a breakdown.' In a statement Glen Garrod, Lincolnshire's assistant director for adult social care, said: 'Safeguarding concerns had been put in place in November 2011. 'The council also expressed concerns about medicine management in September 2011. In October there was a suspension order put in place. 'In February 2012 this was lifted but the couple continued to struggle to make payments. Business: They also ran Terrington Lodge, a care home near King's Lynn in Norfolk . 'Mr Beeharry sent two letters, one on June 1 and one on June 6. He stated they were struggling financially due to lower occupancy rates. 'He expressed concerns about the lack of referrals to the care home and expressed concerns about late payments from residents widening the deficit.' The couple were found dead on June 9, 2012.

Saving nation: A survey, released by savings body NS&I, found that the average earner is saving eight per cent of their wages. This is the first time the quarterly survey has shown savings above £100 . Despite the squeeze on household budgets, determined savers are putting away more than £100 every month. The figure marks a highpoint for personal saving, with the average person now saving eight per cent of their income every month. The findings, released by Treasury-backed savings body NS&I, are striking given the continued rise in living costs coupled with flat-lining wages. After four years of low interest rates, held at 0.5 per cent by the Bank of England, earners are also offered poor returns on their savings. But NS&I found that we are setting aside £104 every month, the first time its quarterly survey has produced a figure of more than £100. The rise is thought to have been driven by younger savers, many of whom are saving in the hope of buying a home. Savers aged between 25 and 34 are putting away just over 9 per cent of their incomes each month - equivalent to £125 - the highest average since 2010. Nearly 60 per cent of those surveyed in the age group said that they were saving for their home, whether to pay a mortgage or for home improvements. The proportion of Britons who are not saving anything has also fallen from one quarter three months ago to one fifth in the latest study. Londoners were found to be saving the most, at an average of almost 10 per cent of their incomes, or £142 each month. Two-fifths of Londoners said they are saving to have cash for an emergency, while three in ten are saving for retirement. Both of these figures were the highest propensity recorded across Britain. Meanwhile, savers in Wales are putting the least cash aside, saving £87 or just under 8% of their average income. Striving: Savers aged between 25 and 34 are putting away just over 9 per cent of their incomes each month - equivalent to £125 - the highest average since 2010 . Savers in the South West of England are putting away the least as a proportion of their income, at just over 7 per cent, or £90 a month. Saving levels in Scotland are at their highest in two years, with Scottish savers putting aside just under 8 per cent of their incomes.

Google has learned that the more time people spend online, the more likely they are to use its dominant search engine or one of its other popular services, like its YouTube video site or Gmail, that include advertising. The delivery service also could spur merchants to buy more online ads if Google's same-day delivery service encourages consumers to do more of their shopping online. Having to wait days or, in some cases, more than a week for the delivery of online orders ranks among the biggest drawbacks to Internet shopping. It's a problem that Amazon.com Inc. and eBay Inc., which operate the largest e-commerce sites, already have been trying to solve by offering same-day service in some U.S. markets. Further expansion: If the pilot program goes well, Google Inc. plans to expand delivery service to other markets . Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world's largest retailer, also offers same-day delivery in five markets. A mix of national, regional and neighborhood merchants are enlisting in Google Shopping Express. The best-known names on the list include Target Inc. and Walgreen Co. All the merchants in the Google program will sell certain items through a central website. Google has hired courier services to pick up the orders at the merchant stores and then deliver them to the customer's home or office. Although the couriers will be working on a contract basis, they will be driving Google trucks and wearing company-issued uniforms. It remains unclear whether Internet shopping and same-day delivery can be profitable. Online grocer Webvan collapsed in 2001, largely because it couldn't devise a pricing plan that would pay for the costs of same-day delivery without alienating shoppers unwilling to pay too much extra for the added convenience. Google is still trying to figure out how much to charge for its same-day delivery service. Competition: Google is trying to lure more customers who expect same-day delivery from rivals like eBay and Amazon . For the six-month test period in the San Francisco area, consumers won't have to pay a surcharge. Google instead will receive a commission from participating merchants. The expansion into same-day delivery comes at the same time that Google is preparing to close some of its older online services so it can devote more attention and money to other projects. The realignment has irked some Google users. The biggest complaints have centered on Google Reader, which allows people to automatically receive headlines and links from their favorite sites, and iGoogle, which allows Web surfers to design a page consisting of the Google search engine surrounded set up other online features, such as local weather reports and stock market quotes. Google Reader is scheduled to close in July and iGoogle will shut down in November. Google shares fell $8.47 to close at $794.19 on Thursday.","Search leader conducting trial-run of home delivery in San Francisco and surrounding areas .

Digital warfare: UK hackers have launched a cyber attack on Argentine online video game Counter Strike (above) which features scenes from the Falklands War and allows players to shoot british 'terrorists' Controversial: Argentine company Dattatec.com this week launched a 'map' for the popular first-person shooter game pitting Argentine police against the British . Fernando Llorente, a spokesman for the Rosario-based company, said: 'Two of our websites were attacked using DDoS during the day, with hackers trying to saturate our server's connexion. 'The attack was 5 Gbps in strength - the equivalent of 5,000 PCs connecting to the sites at the same time every second - but our technical team was able to block it effectively. 'Generally these attacks come from eastern Europe and China, but we detected that most, although not all, of the IP addresses used this time were from the UK. 'At Dattatec we habitually receive different scopes of attack - this is the first one that has come mainly from the UK, although I cannot affirm that it was a case of cyber warfare. 'We think diplomacy should prevail between Argentina and the UK and we do not fear another attack - when someone tries to hit a server and is blocked, they do not try again.' Online onslaught: The game's developers said two of its websites were attacked by hackers trying to saturate our server's connection with massive amounts of data . Stoking tensions: The game features an opening video which reads: 'In 1982, Argentines fought the English to recover the sovereignty of their Malvinas islands' - the Argentine name for the disputed territory . A distributed denial of service (DDoS) is the technical name for cyber attacks that overwhelm computers and make websites disappear. They are potentially devastating for businesses and their reputations. The first DDoS attacks occurred in the late 1990s. They are launched by competitors, extortionists and so-called politically motivated 'hacktivists'. A cyber attacker floods a network connection with tens of gigabits of traffic. This creates bottlenecks in firewalls, routers and the connection itself. Then, when the next request for service tries to come or go, the network connection is clogged and communication stops. Another scenario sees an attacker flood a target with hundreds of thousands of requests per second, then when the server attempts to process them it shuts down. Counter Strike features two opposing groups of players, with one side playing police and the other terrorists. Dattatec's adaptation of the game features an opening video which reads: 'In 1982, Argentines fought the English to recover the sovereignty of their Malvinas islands' - the Argentine name for the disputed territory. The company said it had left British flags out of the map 'out of respect to the honour and glory of those who fell in the Malvinas'. Mr Llorente said the game had been downloaded by 15,000 users since it was launched on Monday. An estimated 650 Argentines, 255 British servicemen and three islanders died in the 1982 conflict. This month, Falkland Islanders overwhelmingly voted in favour of remaining a British Overseas Territory in a referendum. But Argentina's foreign minister, Hector Timerman, this week described the vote as 'illegal'. In May 2011, an add-on was designed for Counter Strike which enabled gamers to recreate an attack on Osama bin Laden's Pakistan compound. Players were able to act out the role of Navy SEALS as they descend on the terror chief's Abbotabad home.

MPs last night voiced grave concerns over the arrest of a policeman accused of leaking details of Andrew Mitchell’s foul-mouthed ‘pleb’ rant. Scotland Yard said a constable in the Diplomatic Protection Group was held on suspicion of misconduct in public office relating to the leaking of details of the former Chief Whip’s confrontation with officers at the gates of Downing Street in September. But the decision prompted anger among both rank-and-file officers and MPs – with critics warning the episode raised ‘chilling’ questions about the ability of whistle-blowers to go public with their concerns. Scroll down for video . 'Plebs': An officer has been arrested over a leak that led to the resignation of Tory Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell (pictured) after an altercation with officers in Downing Street . Mr Mitchell, who was forced to quit . the Cabinet the following month, welcomed the development, saying he had . been the victim of ‘false’ claims. Last night it also emerged that . another MP has been dragged into the inquiry after the Independent . Police Complaints Commission said the officer under investigation may . have spoken to their local Member of Parliament about what happened . outside the No 10 gates. A report into Press standards by Lord . Justice Leveson, published last month, recommended banning so called . ‘off the record’ conversations between police officers and journalists. At the time, critics said this could deter potential whistle-blowers who . may be too scared to reveal potentially important information for fear . of being arrested. Last night Tory MP Philip Davies said: . ‘Officials should not be arrested for leaking information they believe . to be in the public interest. 'I can understand why the police might want . to discipline someone who leaked information but it would be a very sad . day if that were ever held to be a crime. Scandal: Mr Mitchell was forced to resign after pressure from MPs aand members of the Metropolitan Police Federation . ‘I believe in free speech and a free Press and I see no reason why stories of this kind should not be printed. ‘We could either end up in a situation . where this kind of thing is explicitly not allowed, or there would be a . chilling effect in which the media and public officials become too . scared of the consequences.’ A police log of the confrontation, . details of which were leaked to two newspapers, is widely seen as . costing Mr Mitchell his job in October. He maintained yesterday the . police account of the affair, reproduced right, was ‘false’ and insists . he never used the word ‘pleb’. Labour MP John Mann said: ‘This raises . big concerns about the freedom of whistle-blowers who are meant to be . protected. 'It was without question in the public interest this . information came out. It begs questions about what’s going on. It has . all the characteristics of a witch-hunt.’ The Police Federation said the arrest . was ‘disproportionate’ and of ‘great regret’. The IPCC is supervising . the investigation by Scotland Yard. The police watchdog said the . arrested officer allegedly witnessed Mr Mitchell insulting a policeman . outside Downing Street while he was off duty. He is then thought to have told an MP . about what he had seen. Mr Mitchell resigned in October after weeks of . controversy over what he was reported to have said to police after being . told he could not ride his bike through the main gates. Scotland Yard said the arrest resulted . from fresh information following a previous investigation in September. ‘These inquiries found no evidence to suggest any of the officers . involved in the incident were involved in the unauthorised release of . information.

Won: A jury awarded former Hodgekiss student Cara Munn, now 20, more than $40million after a tick-borne illness left her brain damaged and unable to speak . A former student of a prestigious Connecticut boarding school was awarded $41.7million by a jury after she said she contracted a tick-borne illness on a school trip to China that left her brain damaged and unable to speak. Cara Munn, now 20, was 15 at the time of the 2007 Hotchkiss School class trip to China. Her attorney said that she was bitten in a remote part of the Asian country. However, the college preparatory school announced today that it intends to appeal the jury award. Munn, of New York City, was a ninth-grader at Hotchkiss when she joined a school-supervised trip to China during the summer of 2007, according to her lawsuit. The then-15-year-old suffered insect bites that led to tick-borne encephalitis, her attorneys said. The school failed to ensure that the students take any precautions against ticks and allowed them to walk through a densely wooded area known to be a risk area for tick-borne encephalitis and other tick- and insect-transmitted illnesses, her attorneys said. 'Hotchkiss failed to take basic safety precautions to protect the minor children in its care,' Munn's attorney Antonio Ponvert III said. 'I hope that this case will help alert all schools who sponsor overseas trips for minors that they need to check the CDC for disease risks in the areas where they will be traveling, and that they must advise children in their care to use repellant and wear proper clothing when necessary. ‘Cara's injuries were easily preventable.' Prestigious: The Hotchkiss School in Connecticut is a college prep boarding school, costing more than $45,000 per year in tuition . Attorneys for the school argued that tick-borne encephalitis is such a rare disease that it could not have foreseen a risk and could not be expected to warn Munn or require her to use protection against it. Hotchkiss officials said they remain very saddened by Munn's illness and hope for improvements to her health. 'We care deeply about all our students,' the school said in a statement. 'We make every effort to protect them, whether they are here or participating in a school-sponsored activity off-campus. 'We put great care and thought into planning and administering off-campus programs, and we extend the same care to students on these trips as to students on campus.' Historically, Hotchkiss students have undertaken study, service projects and travel in the United States and throughout the world and derived great benefit from the opportunities, the school said. The case lasted eight days, and the jury deliberated for about eight hours before returning their verdict. Room and board for the college preparatory school was $46,775 for the 2012-2013 school year, not including laundry, health, and technology fees. It has one of the largest endowments in the country.","Cara Munn, 20, was 15 when she made class trip to China .

Sir Frank Williams is keeping his Formula One business in the family by promoting his daughter, Claire, to the newly-created role of deputy team principal. The announcement comes two weeks after Sir Frank's wife, Lady Virginia, 66, known as 'Ginny', died following a two-year battle with cancer.

He said: 'With Claire being appointed deputy team . principal, I know the future of Williams is in extremely safe hands. This appointment also had Ginny’s blessing, who I know would have been . incredibly proud to have seen Claire taking on this position by my . side.' The team had planned on announcing the . appointment just before the start of the current season, but decided on a . delay in light of Lady Virginia's death.

Miss Williams, 36, takes on the role with immediate effect  and will retain her current position as commercial director and continue to be part of the company’s board. Sir Frank said he is keen to hand over the reins to the next generation and his daughter's appointment was not handed to her on a plate. He said: 'It is no secret that Claire . is my daughter but I am proud to say that she has fought hard to earn . this appointment and of all the battles she has had to fight, the . prejudices of her father were not the least challenging,' After obtaining a degree in politics . from Newcastle University, Miss Williams became the team’s press officer . in 2002. She had a succession of promotions before becoming director of . marketing and communications. Gave her blessing: Lady Virginia knew of her daughter's promotion before her death two weeks ago . Grown up in the sport: Claire pictured as a young girl with her parents and siblings . On her latest promotion, she said: 'I have grown up in the sport and learnt the ropes from . one of Formula One’s legendary team principals and as a result I feel . well equipped for this new challenge. 'I understand the commitment that . every person within the team gives each day to see our car out on the . track, and I am determined to see us back at the top. 'It . has been a sad month for my family and Williams as a company following . the death of my mother, but as the season takes hold we must look to the . future. It will be a privilege to play a part in taking the team into . what I hope will be a successful next chapter.' If Miss Williams does eventually take over from her father as team . principal, she will not be the first woman to run a Formula One outfit. Swiss-based Sauber already have Monisha Kaltenborn as principal. Her promotion is also not the first time Williams have struck a blow for equality in the sport.

More than half of America's rivers and streams are now unable to support life after decades of pollution, it was revealed yesterday. The bulk of the damage has been done by agricultural fertilisers such as phosphorus and nitrogen washing from fields into waterways. In total, 55 per cent of rivers and streams were classified by the Environmental Protection Agency as being 'poor', with only a fifth in good health. Polluted: Rivers such as the Mississippi are now largely lifeless thanks to farming . The agency sampled nearly 2,000 locations in 2008 and 2009 - from rivers as large as the Mississippi River to streams small enough for wading. The study found more than 55 per cent of them in poor condition, 23 per cent in fair shape, and 21 per cent in good biological health. The most widespread problem is high levels of nutrient pollution, caused by phosphorus and nitrogen washing into rivers and streams from farms, cities, and sewers. High levels of phosphorus - a common ingredient in detergents and fertilisers - are found in 40 per cent of rivers and streams. Another major problem is over-development, as land clearing and building along waterways increases erosion and flooding, allowing more pollutants to enter waters. Beautiful: But human activity on the Hudson and elsewhere has done severe damage to the ecological diversity of America's waterways . 'This new science shows that America's streams and rivers are under significant pressure,' said Nancy Stoner, from the EPA's water office. 'We must continue to invest in protecting and restoring our nation's streams and rivers as they are vital sources of our drinking water, provide many recreational opportunities, and play a critical role in the economy.' Conditions are worse in the East, the report found. More than 70 per cent of streams and rivers from the Texas coast to the New Jersey coast are in poor shape. Streams and rivers are healthiest in sparsely populated Western mountain areas, where only 26 per cent were classified as in poor condition. The EPA also found some potential risks for human health. In 9 per cent of rivers and streams, bacteria exceeded thresholds thought to endanger health. The toxic chemical mercury was found in fish along 13,000 miles of streams at levels exceeding health-based standards. Mercury can enter the environment from coal-burning power plants and from burning hazardous wastes. The Obama administration finalised regulations to control mercury pollution from coal-burning power plants for the first time in late 2011.","Pollution is due to fertiliser use and over-development .

A reward of £30,000 is still on offer for the safe return of the Stradivarius, which was taken in London when Korean-born violinist Min-Jin Kym, 32, went to buy a sandwich in November 2010 . A violin initially thought to be the £1.2 million Stradivarius stolen from a classical musician is likely to be a replica, police said today. The instrument was seized in a raid by Bulgarian officers in February but experts have concluded it is not the 300-year-old antique. The replica is believed to be a training violin made in Germany or the Czech Republic no more than 100 years ago, British Transport Police (BTP) said. A reward of £30,000 is still on offer for the safe return of the Stradivarius, which was taken in London when Korean-born violinist Min-Jin Kym, 32, went to buy a sandwich in November 2010. The internationally acclaimed musician was targeted when she sat down to eat at a branch of Pret A Manger outside Euston station and noticed the black case containing the instrument was missing. Detective Chief Inspector Simon Taylor said: 'After a violin bearing Stradivarius markings was recovered in Bulgaria on Wednesday February 27, we worked closely with underwriters, the Serious Organised Crime Agency and Bulgarian police, through Interpol, to establish if it was the 1696 Antonio Stradivarius taken from Euston in 2010. 'Experts examined the instrument in Sofia and it is thought to be a replica training violin, made in either Germany or the modern-day Czech Republic no more than 100 years ago.' The 1696 Antonio Stradivarius violin, valued at about £1.2 million, was stolen with a £62,000 Peccatte bow and another bow valued at more than £5,000, both of which were in the same case. The violin has a number of unique identifying marks, including visible repair marks under the bridge and a specially moulded chin strap. Three people were arrested in connection with the theft in 2011 following a public appeal on the BBC’s Crimewatch programme. There are only 400 violins made by legendary creator Antonio Stradivari left in existence and the finest Stradivarius examples are worth up to £8million (file picture) John Maughan, 32, and two teenagers were later convicted and sentenced but the violin and bows were not recovered. While the missing items are of high value, they are so unique that they are unlikely to sell for anything close to their true price and would be quickly recognised as stolen property by art or antiques dealers. A spokesman for the violinist said: 'Ms Kym appreciates the efforts of the police and the insurance company in the ongoing search for the stolen instrument, and for the many good wishes from the public at this time.' Gemma Stevens, musical instruments insurance director at Lark Insurance, said: 'Our main concern continues to be recovering the irreplaceable instrument. 'Not only has this been a huge loss to our client, it’s also been a significant loss to the world of musical instruments. As such, the reward has been increased and we would urge anyone who has any information regarding the violin to contact Crimestoppers.'","The replica is believed to be a training violin no more than 100 years old .

With their colourful bills and theatrical eye markings, they are sometimes called the clowns of the sea. But ever since I saw a breeding colony of puffins on an island in the Scillies, I’ve had an enormous respect for the bird. For much of the year they fish far out in the Atlantic. They’re amazing swimmers and can dive 50 metres or more in pursuit of fish. Then, around this time of the year, they get together on a rocky island or cliff-top to begin their incredible courtship displays. A glimpse of a breeding pair ‘kissing’ — rubbing their bright orange beaks together in a characteristic bonding activity — is unforgettable. In danger: Puffins are one of a number of British species which are suffering because of the cold weather . So is the sight of a parent bird returning to its underground nest with half a dozen fish neatly arranged head-to-tail in its bill. Tragically, this ageless drama is likely to be severely curtailed this year. As the country shivers in unseasonably low temperatures, hundreds of frozen and emaciated puffins are being washed up along the east coast. Experts say they are dying because of wind-chill and the difficulty of feeding in turbulent seas when fish are going deeper. One ecologist spoke of it as the worst ‘puffin wreck’ in half a century. And it’s not just sea birds that are suffering. Across Britain, the Arctic winds have plunged nature back into lockdown mode just as she was preparing for her big spring show. It’s as if someone pressed the pause button just at the start of an action adventure movie. Where I live on Exmoor we’ve thankfully been spared the snowfall that’s brought misery to so many parts of Britain. Even so, the icy blast from the east has halted spring in its tracks. On many hedge-banks primroses have been out for a fortnight. But in the biting winds they’ve become limp and lifeless, tattered imitations of what they were meant to be. On the trees and hedgerows bud-burst has ground to a halt. Even the blackthorn — whose brilliant floral display is the most dependable of all the signs of spring — seems unwilling to put on a show this year. Cold comfort: Farmers have been battling to save lambs as they are born into perishing conditions . Never has the old adage been truer — ‘ne’er cast a clout [warm piece of clothing] ’til May is out’. Below the flower-less branches, a cock pheasant hunkers down to shelter from the wind. In a normal year, he’d be strutting and scrapping in a ritual contest for a mate. Today, all he thinks of is survival. In the field behind our house, the ewes and lambs have gone out to sparse pasture. Three weeks ago the turf appeared to be greening up. Now the plants on which the wealth of the countryside depends are back under starter’s orders. This means both ewes and lambs will be on frugal rations for a while. The only thing that’ll bring better times is a warm soil. Conditions are far worse in snow-hit areas, of course. For many days, exhausted sheep farmers and shepherds have been probing deep drifts for signs of life. Despite the popular jokes, sheep are intelligent, resourceful animals. I’ve seen our hardy Exmoor sheep survive happily by foraging under a foot of snow. But when they’re trapped beneath drifts several metres deep, there’s little chance for them. That’s why for many farming families the spring of 2013 will be memorable for all the wrong reasons. For a reminder of a kinder spring I re-read a chapter of Brian Vesey-Fitzgerald’s war-time classic, A Country Chronicle. He writes of March: ‘At the very end of the month the butterflies reappeared. I expect to see peacock and brimstone and tortoiseshell, as a rule, about the third week of the month. ‘I count among my great joys in the year this first sight of brimstone hovering in the sunlit lane and feeding on the fresh spring flowers. Among my great thrills is the sight of those golden wings fluttering over the primroses.’ March is also the time for hibernating mammals to wake, says Vesey-Fitzgerald. ‘Among mammals, dormice and bats are our only true hibernators. In March they begin to stir. It is the ear rather than the eye that catches the first signs of returning liveliness — little irritable squeakings, as though they resented the return of spring and would like another month in bed.’ For hibernating mammals, the spring of 2013 will provide a very rude awakening. Mammals such as dormice and hedgehogs spend the weeks before hibernation building up fat reserves to see them through their long sleep. When the winter is unusually long — as it has been this year — waking can bring the risk of starvation. Insect-eating birds and bats are also likely to suffer. In the big March chill, insects are scarce. So the many small birds and bats that rely on them for food are likely to be on starvation rations. So is the wakening frog as it slides from its wintering place among a heap of damp, dead leaves. There’s no food, and when it reaches the pond there’s a solid layer of ice on top. Butterflies are nowhere to be seen. The numbers of many species were hit hard by the deluges of last summer. The current icy weather will come as a further blow. Battling the elements: Sheep farmers have been scouring snow drifts for signs of life . Yet for all the harshness of this frozen spring, there are compensations, too. A couple of days ago I took the high road home across the top of the Brendon Hills. In the dusk light, the roadside hedges and trees were painted in the gleaming, almost incandescent white of a thick hoar frost. I stopped the car in a lay-by and switched off the engine and lights. It was a breath-taking sight. The cold Arctic air was clear as crystal. Looking across the Bristol Channel I could see the lights of distant Cardiff Airport as clearly as if it had been at the bottom of the hill. And there, in the cold clarity of the frozen night, came the hope that only we humans know. However long this extended winter lasts, there will be a spring. The half-opened buds will finally burst and blossom will at last drape the trees. The hedgerows will explode into life, and bees and butterflies will once more fill the air. In fact, there’s every likelihood that spring — whenever it comes — will be more showy and flamboyant than ever. Nature has an amazing way of balancing things out. It’s hard to believe that just one year ago we were all concerned about the drought! There’s another message from this frozen spring, one that’s rather more sombre. For all our planet-changing skills and technology, we’re still at the mercy of the cosmos. A blast of icy air from the polar regions can even now — if not bring life in Britain to a halt — make things extremely uncomfortable. However sophisticated our society may be, we continue to depend for our well-being on the elemental forces of nature. We ignore them at our peril.","Puffins dying because of wind-chill and turbulent seas .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 17:22 EST, 27 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 21:08 EST, 27 March 2013 . The governor of Iowa held a rare public meeting on Wednesday to discuss whether he should set free a convicted murderer sentenced to life in prison without patrol in 1974, who many believe is contrite and deserves a second chance. Supporters of 66-year-old Rasberry Williams urged Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad to commute the sentence so he can be released, while the victim's relatives said they had forgiven him. The unusual public hearing adds momentum to Williams' bid to have his sentence changed to a fixed term so he can be released on parole after 38 years in prison. Williams was imprisoned after he shot and killed his neighbor in 1974m since then he has become a model prisoner and saved the lives of two prison guards . The Iowa Board of Parole recommended last month that Branstad commute Williams' sentence, saying he has been a model inmate who has mentored scores of young offenders and students, got an education while behind bars, and once intervened in a hostage situation to save the lives of two prison guards. The judge who presided over his 1975 trial and the prosecutor who convicted him have also supported Williams' commutation application. Branstad called the hearing to gather input from the community where Williams shot and killed Lester Givhan, his 40-year-old neighbor, outside a pool hall in July 1974. Williams shot Givhan after the two had argued over a $30 gambling debt. Williams claimed self-defense, but jurors convicted him of first-degree murder, which carries a mandatory sentence of life without parole. Dozens of people, including relatives of . Williams and Givhan, packed a conference room at the Black Hawk County . Courthouse, where two lawyers from Branstad's office and four parole . board members heard comments. 'Rasberry believed in me at a time when I . didn't believe in myself,' said Ray Brown, who served in prison with . Williams for 11 years. Lee Dennis Reed, right, cousin of Lester Givhan addresses the crowd as he said he has grown to forgive Rasberry Williams, at a hearing for the members of the Iowa Board of Parole on Wednesday . The Iowa Board of Parole including Doris Kelley, Jason Carlstrom, James Felker, and Thomas Phillips listen to the public speak about Rasberry Williams' sentence . 'It would be such a blessing, Gov. Branstad, if you were to see fit to let Rasberry come back home to us, live the rest of his life with us. He'll be an asset to so many of the young men here in Waterloo.' Branstad, who has only commuted life sentences of two inmates during 18 years in office, has until early May to decide whether to accept the parole board's recommendation. Doing so would allow Williams to become eligible for parole, which would allow him to eventually be released back into the community. Brown said Williams' advice helped him stay out of trouble and become a drug treatment counselor. Two former offenders told similar stories, describing how Williams counseled them during walks through the prison courtyard, encouraging them to take personal responsibility for their actions. Terry Sallis said he served with Williams at the prison in Fort Madison in the 1970s, and Williams berated him when he returned to prison in 1999. Ray Brown, a childhood friend of Rasberry Williams, urges members of the Iowa Board of Parole to commute the sentence of Williams . Williams once intervened in a hostage situation at the Iowa State Penitentiary in Fort Madison to save the lives of two prison guards . He said Williams encouraged him to get an education after his release, and he has become a mental health therapist 'primarily due to a lot of conversations Ras and I had.' 'None of us are the same that we were 37 years ago,' Salas said. 'He's made some incredible changes.' Williams' defense lawyer at trial, Wallace Parrish, said his client was guilty but had atoned for his actions by leading an exemplary life behind bars. He said Givhan had taunted and bullied Williams for years. 'It doesn't excuse it, but it does mitigate it,' he said. Givhan's cousin, Ola Belle Reed, said Givhan's character was no worse than Williams' because they both lived a lifestyle that involved gambling in seedy hangouts. She said she had forgiven Williams for killing Givhan, who had been planning to get married before he died. But she also said she did not understand the criminal justice system, and how a life prison term could be transformed into something shorter. 'I have never heard a word from Mr. Rasberry Williams to our family that he is sorry. That is all that I would like to hear. He took our cousin away from us!' she said. 'But I do forgive him.' Parole Board Chairman Jason Carlstrom later noted that Williams had been barred from contacting Givhan's family. Williams' supporters said he had repeatedly expressed remorse for his actions. Show of support: Terry Sallis who knew Rasberry Williams tries to inform the members of the Iowa Board of Parole about why Williams' sentence should be commuted . Wallace Parrish defense attorney for Rasberry Williams when Williams was on trial for murder speaks on his former client's behalf . Another Givhan cousin, Lee Reed, said he hoped Williams would make a difference in the community if released. He said he hoped any decision to release Williams would be based on evidence that he was rehabilitated and no longer a safety threat, and not to save money housing an aging inmate. 'It did hurt us to lose a loved one as it would anyone sitting here,' he said. 'But as the Bible tells us, if you want forgiveness, you must forgive. I believe that. And we forgive him. I hope and pray that he has repented.' Mark Osler, a law professor at University of St. Thomas Law School in Minnesota and an expert on commutation, said Wednesday's hearing was 'really unusual,' something he's never heard of in the nation. He said it was a 'brave and appropriate thing to do' that would lend legitimacy to Branstad's ultimate decision. Osler, who runs a legal clinic that works on commutation petitions, said he was struck by the details of Williams' case, including the agreement from the judge and prosecutor that Williams should get mercy. 'The guy saves some guards, you have the unanimous support of people involved in the case, and you have a public hearing,' he said. 'I don't know of another case that features that combination of unusual factors.'","Rasberry Williams was sentence to life without parole after he killed a man over a gambling debt in 1974 .

Care: Mothers who devote their time to raising their children at the expense of their career must not be penlaised, says the Bishop of Exeter . Stay-at-home mothers are being unfairly penalised for their ‘principled decision’ not to go out to work, a bishop said last night. The Bishop of Exeter added to growing criticism of the Government’s failure to support mothers who sacrifice their professional lives to look after their children. Describing stay-at-home mothers as ‘the glue which enables us to be a healthy society’, the Rt Rev Michael Langrish said his views were shared by a number of bishops. The bishop, who sits in the House of Lords, told the Daily Telegraph the biggest impact of the Government’s policies is on traditional families in ‘middle England’. He said: ‘The concern for me is for those who have made a principled decision to stay at home and taken the financial hit. It is actually unfair and against the Government’s own rhetoric. ‘Where one parent makes a conscious decision to stay at home for the children … they shouldn’t be penalised. ‘The evidence is that what the parent is doing is investing in a child’s development which can save the state significant amounts of money at a later stage. ‘It helps children to develop into adults who are more likely to fulfil their potential and make a net contribution to society.’ The Government has received marked criticism after the removing child benefit from wealthier families with one breadwinner, restricting financial help to those mothers returning to work, and repeatedly delaying tax breaks for married couples. The bishop, a father-of-three with four grandchildren, said he remained ‘eternally grateful’ to his own parents for the fact that he always found one of them at home when he came back from school. ‘We hear a great deal of talk about ‘Broken Britain’ and here we have families making a deliberate choice to make their contribution to the glue which enables us to be a healthy society,’ he said. ‘There’s a lot of research which shows getting parenting right in those early years has a positive impact on health, on education and on social behaviour,’ the bishop added. The bishop says the Government must do more to support mothers who dedicate themselves entirely to family . ‘We hear a lot from the Government about support for this and yet that rhetoric does not seem to be translated into public policy. ‘I have a general concern that we’ve had a lot of rhetoric about the support for family life and good parenting. If the rhetoric had substance I would expect that to be reflected in public policy decisions.’ The bishop also defended parents who feel they have no choice but to stay home because of their belief in family life. He said child benefit tax changes had been based on an assumption that families had chosen the one-earner option ‘as a luxury,’ adding: ‘In many cases, it doesn’t feel like that. 'It feels like something you have to do if you are truly committed to that network of relationships that help to make for a healthy society.’","Rt Rev Michael Langrish says policy punishes mothers without jobs .

Tory MP Graham Stuart broke his pelvis, punctured his right lung and fractured several ribs – after slipping on ice just feet from a restaurant on the last day of his skiing holiday. The 51-year-old was on a four-day trip with a group of friends in Chamonix, the French Alps, and had spent the morning off-piste. He described the accident as ‘painfully ironic and very unheroic’. The MP for Beverley and Holderness has been working from his hospital bed, his office manager said. The education select committee chairman is due to have an operation on his pelvis tomorrow. His officer manager Nicki Roberts said: 'He’s in good spirits and working from his hospital bed. He has been carrying out constituency work. 'He’s on his email and keeping up to date with his Twitter and Facebook pages. He has had various friends to visit. 'It was a freak accident. He was doing the last ski of the last day of the two-day trip. He was skiing to a restaurant and was on soft snow. 'But it turned into ice and he slipped badly. His skis catapulted over his head and he landed badly.' She added: 'Everyone’s just thankful that the doctors have said he will be OK.' After the accident, on March 17, Mr Stuart had to be evacuated from the mountain on a snowmobile. Medics said they expected the father-of-two to be in hospital for at least three weeks. Mr Stuart has thanked well-wishers on his Facebook page. He wrote: 'Thank you for all your warm wishes. 'I appreciate them all and hope you’ll be pleased to know that I’m in good spirits.'

Four parents in conservative community of Dietrich wrote to complain, and now education chiefs in the conservative state are considering his future. Disciplinary committee: A teacher could face the sack for using the word vagina in a biology class (file picture) Mr McDaniel, who said he had never received a complaint in the 18 years he had taught at Dietrich School, is also accused of explaining the biology of an orgasm. He told the Twin Falls Times-News: 'I teach straight out of the textbook, I don't include anything that the textbook doesn't mention. But I give every student the option not to attend this class when I teach on the reproductive system if they don't feel comfortable with the material. 'This sort of thing makes you worry about what you teach. That's not right.' A disciplinary letter from the Idaho State Department of Education also accused McDaniels of showing a video clip in class depicting an infection of genital herpes and teaching about different forms of birth control. The letter also alleges that McDaniels told inappropriate jokes in class. McDaniel also found himself in hot water for asking his students to write a critical response paper on climate change after showing them 'An Inconvenient Truth.' According to a 2002 survey, 66 per cent of church goers in Lincoln County, where Dietrich is located, are affiliated with the Mormon Church, . But it seems the majority of his students back him. One said: 'Here are a couple people in the community that are trying to get Mr McDaniel fired for teaching the reproductive system, climate change, and several other science subjects. All these subjects were taught from the book and in good taste. He cares for each of his students and goes the extra mile to help them all. Now is the time for us to help by supporting him!'

Naughty mom: Wendy Cowell of Grand Junction, Colorado is accused of having sex with her son's underage friend multiple times . SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . When a police detective questioned Crowell at her Grand Junction, Colorado home, she claimed she exchanged texts with all her son’s friends. A gut feeling led the boy’s mother to suspect a possible relationship between her son and Crowell. An arrest affidavit reveals the mother eventually found on her son's cell phone about 20 ‘flirtatious’ text messages between Crowell and her son. Crowell and the boy’s mother had spent some time together and the mother would often leave her son with Crowell while she searched for jobs. The mother said Crowell would often take their two sons rafting and on other, similar trips. According to police, Crowell seduced the boy one night while he was sleeping over with her son. According to the affidavit, the two subsequently had sex five times in three weeks and two of those times while parked in Crowell’s car. The boy’s mother first alerted police to what she believed was occurring between her son and Crowell in June 2012. Crowell has initially brought in for questioning the 26th of that month, when DNA samples were taken and her phone examined. Investigators found what they say is enough evidence to prove the boy and Crowell engaged in sexual acts between May, 20 and June, 20 of 2012. The boy claims no force was involved and that the sex was consensual, while acknowledging Crowell could have been taking advantage of their age disparity. Crowell was booked into custody at the Mesa County Jail with bond set at $10,000. She is next due in court March 14.","Questioned by police about 'flirtatious' messages, Wendy Crowell said she texts all her son's friends .

"By . Rick Dewsbury . UPDATED: . 13:10 EST, 19 January 2012 . Dozens of celebrities and politicians including Gavin Henson and Sadie Frost have settled damages claims over the News of the World phone-hacking scandal, the High Court heard today. Actress and designer Sadie Frost has received £50,000 in damages while Gavin Henson has been paid £40,000. Footballer Ashley Cole has also received damages but the figure was not disclosed. Shaun Russell, whose wife and daughter . were killed in Kent in 1996, and Sara Payne, the mother of murdered . schoolgirl Sarah, are also among 36 claimants who have reached . settlements. The payments are expected to take the total bill for Rupert Murdoch's News International up to £10m. Revelations about the payments came as lawyers said that the company had admitted covering up the scale of illegal activity. Lawyers for the victims said in a statement outside the High Court: 'News Group has agreed to compensation . being assessed on the basis that senior employees and directors of NGN . knew about the wrongdoing and sought to conceal it by deliberately . deceiving investigators and destroying evidence.' The model Sadie Frost, left, accepted £50,000 damages while Gavin Henson, the former partner of Charlotte Church, received £40,000 . Actor Jude Law, left, accepted £130,000 damages plus legal costs while his former partner Sienna Miller, right, is understood to have already reached a settlement . The group of lawyers made the claim before they told the court who had received settlements and for how much. They claim to have obtained documents from News International that revealed its attempts to destroy evidence, partly thanks to the fact that the 12 solicitors’ firms involved had joined forces to work together. 'As a result, documents relating to the nature and scale of the conspiracy, a cover up and the destruction of evidence/email archives by News Group have now been disclosed to the claimants,' their statement said. 'In the face of this overwhelming evidence, the ‘rogue reporter’ position has disintegrated and the range, scale and extent of phone-hacking has become clear.' News International, the British newspaper arm of News Corp, said it would not comment on the statement. Sara Payne, the mother of murdered schoolgirl Sarah Payne, right, is among 36 claimants who have had damages claims against News International settled . Thirty-six claimants have so far been awarded settlements and 18 of these were revealed in court today. They include Jude Law, who has accepted a settlement of . £130,000 plus legal costs from News International while his personal . assistant Ben Jackson received £40,000. Ciara Parkes, his former PR advisor, has received £35,000. After the hearing today, Mr Law condemned the 'appalling' behaviour of News of the World and said he brought legal proceedings 'to try to find out the truth'. His phone was hacked repeatedly, including at JFK Airport in New York. He said: 'For several years leading up to 2006, I was suspicious about how information concerning my private life was coming out in the press. I changed my phones, I had my house swept for bugs but still the information kept being published. I started to become distrustful of people close to me. 'I was truly appalled by what I was shown by the police and by what my lawyers have discovered. It is clear that I, along with many others, was kept under constant surveillance for a number of years. 'No aspect of my private life was safe from intrusion by News Group Newspapers, including the lives of my children and the people who work for me. It was not just that my phone messages were listened to. News Group also paid people to watch me and my house for days at a time and to follow me and those close to me, both in this country and abroad. Australian singer Dannii Minogue, right, sister of Kylie Minogue, left, received a settlement though the figure was not disclosed . Ashley Cole, left, and Noel Gallagher's ex-wife Meg Matthews, right, were paid off after being targeted but the sums were not revealed . MPs who have received settlements include Labour . MP Chris Bryant who was awarded £30,000, Lord Prescott who receives . £40,000 in damages and Joan Hammell, his former chief of . staff, also received £40,000. Labour MP Denis MacShane received £32,500 while MP Claire Ward received substantial damages but these were not disclosed to the court. Speaking to the Hull Daily Mail, Lord . Prescott said: 'Today's court decision at long last brings clarity, . apology and compensation for the years of hacking into my telephone . messages by Rupert Murdoch's News Group Newspapers. 'It follows years of aggressive . denials and a cavalier approach to private information and the law. These denials were supported by the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) and the inaction of senior officers of the Metropolitan Police. 'However, I do not wish to make . further comment on this whole matter until the result of my judicial . review against the Metropolitan Police has been concluded.'

Football Association was given a reported £700,000 to settle a claim . while Max Clifford received a £1m settlement. It was alleged today that  senior employees . and directors at News Group Newspapers (NGN), the News International . subsidiary that published the News of the World, knew journalists were . hacking phones. Lawyers acting on behalf of the victims claim that the group . deliberately deceived police investigators and destroyed potentially . incriminating evidence. NGN has not commented on the suggestion that . senior employees knew what has happening, according to the Guardian. Other claims that have been settled included those from Gavin Henson, the former partner of Charlotte Church. The deals mean that 36 damages claims being brought against News International subsidiary News Group Newspapers (NGN), publisher of the now-defunct News of the World, have been settled. But Mark Thomson, of law firm Atkins Thomson, who represents some of the claimants, said others would press ahead with a trial scheduled for next month. Mr Thomson said: 'All of the claimants have been extremely brave to take on and succeed against a massive and influential multinational media organisation. 'They can take the credit for triggering the new police investigation, the parliamentary inquiries and the Leveson Inquiry. They should be very pleased with what they have achieved. 'A number of claimants are still pursuing the matter to trial and, as a result, NGN will continue to disclose further information and evidence.' Today’s hearing before Mr Justice Vos follows the settlement of a number of other claims against News International subsidiary News Group Newspapers, publisher of the now defunct News of the World. When the case was last before the judge, in December, it emerged that seven cases had been resolved with a number of others likely to be so. It was said in other High Court proceedings in December, involving private investigator Glenn Mulcaire and NGN, that, as of then, more than 60 claimants had commenced proceedings against NGN and Mulcaire for breach of confidence and misuse of private information, with the majority outstanding. Mark Lewis, a lawyer for many of the phone hacking victims, said in an email that the fight against Murdoch's empire was not over. 'While congratulations are due to those (lawyers) and clients who have settled their cases, it is important that we don't get carried away into thinking that the war is over,' Lewis said. 'Fewer than 1 percent of the people who were hacked have settled their cases. There are many more cases in the pipeline. ... This is too early to celebrate, we're not even at the end of the beginning.' Tamsin Allen, of law firm Bindmans, said: 'The claimants now have some clarity about what happened to them in the years between 2000 and 2005 and satisfaction that justice has finally been done. 'Many of them have wondered for years how tabloid newspapers were able to obtain secret personal information about them, even suspecting their closest friends and relatives. 'Lives have been severely affected by this cavalier approach to private information and the law. News Group's misguided decision to defend claims aggressively made matters worse.' The phone-hacking saga began with the conviction in 2007 of private investigator Glenn Mulcaire and the News of the World's royal editor Clive Goodman. At the time NGN said the hacking, involving the voicemails of royal aides, was an isolated incident.But the settlement of legal action by Professional Footballers' Association boss Gordon Taylor and PR man Max Clifford led to speculation that phone hacking was more widespread. As more details of the scandal emerged last summer, the scandal forced the resignation of . Prime Minister David Cameron’s spokesman, a former News of the World . editor. British police were accused of failing to properly investigate . the affair and top police officials resigned. In July, after it emerged that the . voicemail of missing schoolgirl Milly Dowler, later found dead, had been . hacked by the News of the World, News Corp took the drastic step of . shutting down the 168-year-old tabloid. Mr  Cameron set up the Leveson Inquiry to examine the behaviour of the press. News International set up a compensation scheme in November to deal with phone-hacking claims, moving to contain the consequences of a scandal that has rocked the company, the British press, police and the political establishment.It has already received more than 60 claims and police say there are almost 6,000 potential victims. Criminal probes are now under way into the phone hacking and allegations of payoffs to police.  News Corp was forced to scrap plans to take full control of Britain’s highly profitable satellite broadcaster BSkyB. Hearings in the first cases of victims who have not settled are set to begin on February 13.","Settlements could cost the Murdoch empire up to £10m .

"By PETER STANFORD . UPDATED: . 05:05 EST, 22 December 2011 . Puzzle: The Turin Shroud's origin is endlessly debated. Still, the Catholic Church has placed the cloth in a cathedral as an object of worship . The Catholic Church has never publicly accepted or rejected popular belief that the Turin Shroud is the burial cloth of Jesus Christ. But it has done everything short of that to encourage devotion to this ancient piece of linen, on display in Turin Cathedral, which bears the markings of a man who appears to have been crucified. The extraordinary sepia image on the cloth is simply — as Pope Benedict XVI likes to put it in that careful, precise way of his — ‘an image that reminds us always of Christ’s suffering’. Yet, this week, a group of Italian scientists claimed the shroud was created by a ‘supernatural event’ rather than the machinations of medieval forgers. The academics concluded that the sort of burst of ultra-violet light necessary to have left such an imprint on the cloth just wasn’t possible by any human endeavour in any age other than our own technically advanced one with its access to lasers. The implication of their findings is that the image was scorched on to the linen as a result of a divinely generated light given out by Jesus’s body when he rose from the dead. Believers in the shroud hail the research by scientists at Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development (ENEA) as proof that it is genuinely the cloth of Christ. They claim it backs up the work of a group of American scientists from the Shroud of Turin Research Project (STURP) from the Seventies. These scientists established by careful analysis of the fibres of the cloth that the image of the bearded, crucified man had not been painted on to the cloth. It was not, they concluded, ‘a natural formation’. Science, say the believers, appears to have provided no reasonable answer to counter the belief of generations of Christians that this is the image of Christ on the shroud in which his body was wrapped when it was taken down from the cross. Scientists in Italy believe the kind of technology needed to create the Shroud of Turin simply wasn't around at the time that it was created. Still the Vatican steadfastly refuses to be drawn again into the saga . And yet, despite this latest research supposedly proving its authenticity, the Vatican has steadfastly refused to be drawn again into the long-running saga of the shroud. The question is why. Why, if the science seems so certain, won’t the Catholic Church endorse this piece of cloth as the genuine article? One reason is that the new research still cannot get round the main stumbling block when it comes to proving the shroud’s authenticity. In 1988, three separate and internationally acclaimed laboratories in Zurich, Oxford and Arizona carbon-dated samples of the cloth, provided by the Church, and came up with 1260 to 1390 as its probable date of origin. In other words, that research showed it to be a medieval forgery. And in the 23 years since,  the best that the shroud’s devotees have come up with to counter this incontrovertible fact is a theory that all three samples that were carbon-dated were contaminated — that they contained rogue fibres from later medieval attempts to patch and mend the original shroud. There are plenty of papers that try to make this thesis stand up, but the overall impression is of whistling in the wind. So why do people flock to see the . shroud on the rare occasions it is put on public show in its glass, . climate- controlled display case? The most straightforward answer is . that we like a mystery and this one is about as tantalising as it gets. For . just as the Church has never felt able to pronounce definitively on the . shroud, neither has science come up with a water-tight theory as to . exactly what it is and how the image came about. The . shroud therefore exists in a kind of middle ground — where we can all . pronounce our own verdict. But once you start considering the . possibilities of how it was created, you immediately get in a tangle. If it is a medieval forgery, then how can its image have been created by methods beyond the wit of humankind at that time? Why do people flock to see the shroud? We like mystery. Since neither the church nor science have come up with a definitive answer, the shroud exists in middle ground, where we can make our own verdict . One of the most intriguing aspects is that the image of Christ is hard to pick out with the naked eye in the sepia markings on the cloth, which is 4½m long and just over a metre in width. But, when at the very end of the 19th century, a photographic negative of the image was first produced, it looked every inch like the face of Christ. How could a medieval forger have produced something so exact 500 years before the technology existed to make a negative image? Yet the sceptics could easily counter this with an argument of their own. Even if the shroud is really 2,000 years old and the carbon-dating laboratories mistaken, they point out what is there to link it to Jesus? Crucifixion was a common method of putting criminals to death back under the Romans. This might just as well be the funeral wrappings of a run-of-the-mill murderer or thief. Indeed, one theory popular among supporters of the medieval forgery theory is that it was made centuries after the death of Christ by crucifying someone in exactly the same manner as described in the Gospel accounts and then wrapping the victim in a shroud. The further you go into this mystery, the murkier the waters become. And if you go so far as to visit Turin (for 500 years the shroud belonged to the locally based royal house of Savoy) and stand in front of the display case, there is undeniably a certain awe about this object. The Resurrection of Christ, 1463-65, fresco by Piero della Francesca: The Vatican - which owns the Turin shroud - shies away from statements over whether it is real or fake, but says it helps to explore the 'darkest mysteries of faith' It springs, to my mind, not from any air of authenticity that the object itself radiates, but from the knowledge that for centuries people have been making precisely the same pilgrimage as I and so many others have done to gaze at this piece of cloth. It stems from the fact that they have harboured exactly the same hopes that by doing so, somehow, they will be able to reach a final conclusion on the truth or not of the very claims of Christianity. How comforting it would be to know, for sure, if there is a God. What is important today about the shroud is not whether it is genuinely the burial cloth of Jesus — we are never going to reach a consensus on that — but rather that over many centuries people have believed in it. It is this history of belief that is the really powerful thing. At a stroke it carries us back through centuries of Christianity and connects our sceptical, secular and scientific age with an earlier epoch of miracles and faith. This is why the Catholic Church refuse to be drawn on the Turin Shroud. As Pope Benedict says, it is an extraordinarily powerful image of Christ’s suffering —  and made so because of the faith people have in it, whether it is genuine or not. On its own, the shroud is never going to be enough to legitimise belief in the core tenet of Christianity — the Resurrection of Jesus. But nevertheless, it is a powerful focus for our thoughts on the subject — a symbol of the hopes of so many who embrace Christianity without any conclusive proof other than their own belief. And that, surely, is the point about religion — a point we are in danger of missing now that every belief and theory is judged to be worthless unless it can be put under a microscope by scientists and proved, irrefutably, to be true. Some things, some important things, just don’t fit into this rigid, logical model of the world. Science, as the saga of the shroud epitomises, can never get to the bottom of faith. Peter Stanford is a former editor of the Catholic Herald. His latest book, The Extra Mile: A 21st Century Pilgrimage, is published by Continuum.","Italian scientists claim shroud was created by 'supernatural event' as burst of ultra-violet light necessary to leave imprint on cloth wasn't then possible .

Indeed when the multi-millionaire, 44, was asked last year which was his favourite personal pony, he named not one but seven. In America – where he has a £25million beach home and a ranch in Santa Barbara – he said his top mounts were ‘Sweet and Low, Toro, Happy Trap, Mexicana and Antoinette’ thanks to their ‘speed, lateral ability and good temperaments’. In England – where the Lancashire-born playboy has luxury homes in both Kensington and Berkshire – he named Molly, who ‘can do two amazing chukkas and never miss a game’, and Salsa, who ‘may have been my best ever, but she retired after we won the Gold Cup’. Scroll down for video . Rider in a storm: Keen polo player Findus boss Lyndon Lea noted that the price of raw materials for Findus products was rising dramatically. Whether a desire to cut costs led to the horse meat fiasco is yet to be determined . The former Goldman Sachs employee, the son of a British engineer and hairdresser, founded his own hugely successful and aggressive private equity company, Lion Capital. After successes with Weetabix – which he bought and sold on to the Chinese at a massive profit – Jimmy Choo shoes, Kettle Chips and Wagamama, he was hoping the frozen food industry would make him a mint too. Only last year he was claiming that frozen foods could transform their image, and head upmarket. But at the same time he also noted that the price of ‘raw materials’ for Findus products had been rising dramatically. Whether a desire to cut costs led to the horse meat fiasco is yet to be determined. Lea divorced wife Christina some years ago, and has two children, Zachary, seven, and Chiara, nine. 'Reluctant playboy': Lea (pictured with two female friends) has found time to throw lavish parties at his £25m mansion since his divorce to wife Christina some years ago . His polo team, Zacara, is named after the youngsters – as he funds it and plays alongside the professionals. Personally embarrassing though the horsemeat fiasco is, Lea may ride the storm. He previously offered support to the boss of another investment, the American Apparel clothing company, despite its founder Dov Charney becoming embroiled in lewd harassment allegations. Since his divorce, Lea has found time to throw lavish parties; one bash at his £25million mansion had sushi being served off the bodies of near naked women. Apparently keen to rub shoulders with fellow wealthy horse-lovers, Lyndon Lea has enjoyed polo parties also attended by film stars Sienna Miller and Tommy Lee Jones – although he claims to be anxious to play down his ‘playboy’ reputation. Broken rules: By selling horsemeat in lasagne, Findus seems to have broken Lea's 'golden rule in business' - 'You get on chance at life; don't lose it through deception or dishonesty' Perhaps attempting to suggest how down to earth he is, despite his wealth, he told last year how he celebrated winning polo’s prestigious Gold Cup with a pizza and ‘a special bottle of wine’. That special bottle of wine was a 1995 Chateau Haut-Brion – which retails at £250 a pop. And we can probably assume it was not accompanying a Findus pizza. But Lea is not usually one for relaxing. He once claimed he worked at such a frenetic pace he needs three personal assistants to keep up with him. He will be particularly galled that by selling horsemeat in lasagne, Findus, in which his private equity firm has a one third holding, seems to have broken his ‘golden rule in business’ – ‘You get one chance at life; don’t lose it through deception or dishonesty to others or to yourself.’","Findus tycoon Lyndon Lea, 44, has luxury houses in Santa Barbara, Kensington and Berkshire .

Embattled NHS boss Sir David Nicholson was accused of ‘sticking two fingers up to patients’ yesterday as ministers expressed private astonishment at his appointment of a controversial new deputy. Both Tory and Labour MPs criticised the elevation of Dame Barbara Hakin, the former head of the NHS in the West Midlands, despite claims that she gagged a whistleblower who was raising concerns about high patient death rates. She is understood to dispute the allegations against her but is facing a General Medical Council investigation into her conduct. Appointment: Sir David Nicholson (left) has been criticised by MPs for his elevation of Dame Barbara Hakin (right) who faces a GMC inquiry into her conduct . Sir David, who is already facing intense pressure to resign over his role in the Mid Staffordshire scandal, in which as many as 1,200 patients died, shocked Whitehall by announcing that Dame Barbara was to be promoted to be his number two. Her appointment is . temporary while someone is found to fill the role permanently. The move comes amid signs that support for the head of the NHS Commissioning Board is draining away. Ministers calling for him to be sacked blame a powerful trio – Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood, Cabinet Office minister Oliver Letwin and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt – for advising the Prime Minister to keep him on to see through health service reforms. Government sources said ministers had no right to block the appointment of Dame Barbara, since the board is independent of government, but were neither consulted or given any notice. One minister said of Sir David: ‘This guy is not exactly racking up points in his favour.’ Tory MP Philip Davies said: ‘This appears to be a bizarre appointment which sticks two fingers up to NHS patients, but is business as usual for the people who are bringing the NHS into disrepute.’ Charlotte Leslie, another Conservative MP, said the appointment gave the impression of a ‘tight-knit, mafia-like group centring around David Nicholson’. Hearing: Last week Sir David told MPs that gagging orders were 'completely and utterly unacceptable' Labour MP Graham Stringer said: ‘Someone who seems to have presided over a culture of bullying should not be appointed to this role when the NHS needs desperately to move in a new direction.’ Chris Skidmore, a Tory member of the Commons health select committee, said: ‘There seems to be a managerial class that is dominating the health service, moving from post to post without ever properly answering for their actions elsewhere.’ Dame Barbara is said to have helped authorise a payment of £500,000 to silence the chief executive of a hospital trust where 670 patients are feared to have died needlessly. She is also being investigated by the GMC for allegedly quashing a report into high death rates at the trust, United Lincolnshire, in 2009. Criticisms: Labour MP Graham Stringer is among the politicians who have criticised the appointment . Gary Walker, the whistleblower allegedly gagged by Dame Barbara, was chief executive of United Lincolnshire Hospitals until 2010 when he was sacked after warning Dame Barbara that targets were being put ahead of patients. He was later given a £500,000 payoff on the condition he keep quiet about shocking standards at the hospital. Last month he broke his silence to claim that Dame Barbara, then head of the East Midlands Strategic Health Authority supervising the hospital, had ordered him to prioritise targets. Last week Sir David told MPs that gagging orders were ‘completely and utterly unacceptable.’ Six days later he promoted Dame Barbara to be his deputy. When asked by MPs on the health select committee last Tuesday whether he was aware of gagging orders being used in the NHS, he said: ‘I am absolutely against them, and, wherever I see them, I try and stop them.’ Later he was asked specifically about Mr Walker’s gagging order. He replied: ‘It is completely and utterly unacceptable.’ Health ministers privately concede they do not expect Sir David to cling to his job in the long-term – but fear him being replaced by another proponent of Labour’s ‘command and control’ approach to the NHS. No one at the Department of Health was available for comment. Appearing before a committee of senior MPs last night, David Cameron was challenged over the failure to hold anyone accountable for the Mid-Staffs scandal. Tory MP Bernard Jenkin said there appeared to be an ‘unspoken conspiracy... that somehow the ministers are not responsible because the officials or people down the line were responsible, but we can’t hold the officials accountable because of the doctrine of ministerial accountability.’ The Prime Minister said the independent report into the scandal had cautioned against creating ‘scapegoats’ and had suggested that the main responsibility lay with the local hospital management and board. ‘The tragedy is that they weren’t held properly accountable at the time,’ the Prime Minister added.","Dame Barbara Hakin appointed as new deputy by Sir David Nicholson .

A dolphin has been spotted near downtown New York after straying from the ocean and swimming up the East River. Biologists say the dolphin, first seen yesterday near the Upper East Side of Manhattan, appears to be healthy despite being alone and away from its usual ocean habitat. The species has yet to be identified but it is believed to be either a common dolphin, an Atlantic bottlenose dolphin, a white-sided dolphin or a white-beaked dolphin. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The dolphin was spotted swimming in New York's East River near the Robert F. Kennedy bridge . Marine experts are slight concerned as dolphins are sociable animals and rarely leave their pods . Kimberly Durham, the rescue program director at the Riverhead Foundation for Marine Research and Preservation said: 'I've seen some video of it swimming, and it seems to be swimming fairly strong. The dorsal fin of the dolphin breaks the water in New York's East River near the Robert F. Kennedy bridge . 'It appeared to be swimming around a fairly large area of the river, which was an encouraging sign. 'I do get nervous when I see a lone animal,' she added, explaining that dolphins are social animals that typically do not separate themselves from their pods. A biologist from Riverhead was planning to take a boat out on the river along with officials from the state's Department of Environmental Conservation to photograph the dolphin, identify it and to assess its health. It was seen swimming near the Robert F. Kennedy bridge in an area roughly bounded by the East 90s of Manhattan, Randalls Island and the end of Astoria Boulevard in Queens. Police said they were no longer on the scene after notifying Riverhead, which oversees the monitoring of marine animals that enter city waters. In January, a sickly male common dolphin died after becoming stranded in Brooklyn's polluted Gowanus Canal. The Riverhead Foundation said on its Facebook page: . 'We have documented four occasions of reports of cetaceans in or near the East River since 2010. Three of those events were in February and March timeframe. In all four events, intervention was not deemed necessary and the animals did leave the area without further sighting reports.' WATCH VIDEO OF THE DOLPHIN HERE: .","Seen swimming near Robert F.

Rising numbers of  hospitals are failing to respect the dignity and privacy of patients, the care watchdog warns. Nearly a fifth don’t meet national standards for ensuring patients – many of them elderly – are treated with proper compassion and consideration. This marks a sharp rise on the findings of the same survey carried out by the Care Quality Commission the previous year. Failure: Nearly a fifth of hospitals don't meet national standards for ensuring patients - many of them elderly - are treated with proper compassion and consideration (file picture) Some elderly patients say they are too frightened to call for help at night in case they are told off by nursing staff for ‘interfering’, the CQC report said. On other wards, staff risk embarrassing patients by putting the names of those who need a catheter on display on notice boards. The CQC also found that staff had filled-in ‘Do Not Resuscitate’ forms – apparently without getting consent from patients or their families. In some wards, basic privacy was not respected because the curtains were not shut around beds when patients were examined. Over the last 12 months the watchdog inspected 50 hospitals and found 18 per cent were not meeting national standards for treating patients with dignity and respect. Last year 12 per cent were found to be not adhering to these requirements. Although this is only a snapshot of the 300 hospitals across the NHS, there are concerns that the failings are widespread. Some elderly patients say they are too frightened to call for help at night in case they are told off by nursing staff for 'interfering' The findings come a month after a devastating report into the Mid Staffordshire hospital scandal in which hundreds died due to neglect. There is now growing concern that similar failings exist in hospitals across the health service. The report comes as the Mail continues to fight for better standards in hospitals through its Dignity for the Elderly Campaign. The CQC warns that although hospitals have made improvements in ensuring patients have enough to eat and drink, too many are failing to provide ‘basic care.’ David Behan, chief executive of the CQC said: ‘It is disappointing people are still not being given enough privacy and that they are left alone when they call for help. ‘This is basic care and getting it right can transform a stressful experience for an older person into a supportive and caring one. ‘Safe, good quality care is not complex or time-consuming.’ Scandal: The findings come a month after a report into the Mid Staffordshire hospital (Stafford hospital pictured) scandal in which hundreds died due to neglect . Inspectors found staff were talking over patients as if they weren’t there or making them wait if they rang call-bells. On one ward inspectors found that two thirds of ‘Do Not Resuscitate’ forms had been filled-in without seeking the consent of the patient or their family. The forms state that doctors should not try to revive the patient should their heart stop beating. They should only be signed following detailed discussions with the patient or their family members. One patient told inspectors that they were frightened to call for help at night because they had earlier been told off by a hospital worker for ‘interfering’. They had tried to warn the nurse that another patient was ringing their call-bell but a member of staff had ‘displayed annoyance’. In another hospital, inspectors saw one worker tell a colleague ‘I think you’ve got a lost cause there’ because the patient they were trying to feed had fallen asleep. The report found that one in three hospitals were failing to meet all five national standards on respect, feeding patients, protecting them from abuse, keeping adequate records and having a safe number of staff. One, Milton Keynes, in Buckinghamshire, did not meet any of these requirements while Newham hospital in East London met just one. Katherine Murphy of the Patients Association said: ‘Call bells going unanswered and people left to soil their beds because they don’t get help going to the toilet is an utter disgrace. Pockets of poor care on this scale are unacceptable and typify the cultural change needed.’","Elderly patients too frightened to call for help for fear they are 'interfering'

Patients could be charged £8.50 to call an out-of-hours doctor to their home under controversial plans outlined today. The sick could also be forced to pay for their hospital meals or increased charges to watch television on NHS wards. The proposals are being floated as a way of tackling the ‘unprecedented financial dilemma’ faced by the Health Service. Controversial: Patients could be charged £8.50 to call an out-of-hours doctor to their home under plans outlined today (file picture) But campaigners expressed outrage at the ‘frank discussion’ document, saying it undermined the founding principle of the NHS that care must be free at the point of use. They also warned that seriously ill patients could be discouraged from seeking treatment if they feared being unable to afford the fees. The NHS Confederation, which represents all Health Service trusts, devised the ideas as ways of generating extra funds. Chief executive Mike Farrar said: ‘We need to talk openly and honestly about why our Health Service needs to change. We cannot risk the wheels coming off and patient care suffering. ‘The NHS is facing severe pressure on its finances. We need to have a frank discussion about the road ahead.’ The report makes it clear that the NHS is under dire financial strain thanks to the soaring costs of caring for an ageing population. Food for thought: The sick could also be forced to pay for their hospital meals or increased charges to watch television on NHS wards (file picture) There are also rising numbers patients suffering illnesses caused by obesity and alcohol abuse. This already totals £17.9billion a year and is expected to rise even further. Last night Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, said: ‘Calling out a doctor or having a meal in hospital are key tenets of an NHS which is free at the point of use. Some of these proposals amount to what would effectively be a “patients’ tax”. ‘It would be absolutely unacceptable for patients to foot the bill for reform through  new charges.’ Andrew Gwynne, a Labour health spokesman, said: ‘Long-term efficiency savings are not being made. ‘Instead, the NHS is cutting the “low-hanging fruit”, such as staffing, with serious consequences for patient care. ‘The Government should take heed of this advice from the NHS Confederation.’ Pressure: NHS Confederation chief executive Mike Farrar said that a frank discussion was needed as the NHS faces severe pressure on its finances . Any fees would apply to everyone over 18 who has basic health insurance – around 90 per cent of the population. But surveys have found 27 per cent of patients would delay calling out a doctor and 18 per cent would avoid it altogether if they had to pay. However, some trusts are already considering imposing a £10-a-day fee to watch TV. Last year, an NHS trust went into administration for the first time and officials estimate there are around 20 more in severe crisis, with combined debts of about £130million. The costs of propping-up Private Finance Initiative deals will worsen the position even more in the next decade. Now, the NHS spends £1.5billion of its annual £100billion budget on these but this is set to double in the next decade, warned the report.","Controversial plans put forward to tackle pressure on NHS finances .

From a Communist parade to a crowd of laughing schoolchildren, this collection of 1950s photographs offers a fascinating glimpse into the daily lives of post-war North Koreans. The grainy black and white pictures - taken in the early years of 'Great Leader' Kim Il-Sung's rule after the Korean War - came to light after a collector stumbled across them in a dusty antique shop in Czechoslovakia. The rare snapshots are in contrast to state-issued photographs of military drills that have emerged from modern North Korea in recent weeks, as relations between the secretive state and its neighbour to the South grow increasingly sour. Rare: The collection of extraordinary photographs taken in post-war North Korea - including this one of a Communist parade - was discovered in an antique shop . Daily life: Czech collector Petr Doubrava came across the photographs, including this one of North Korean children in the 1950s, by chance . The unique collection features images of smiling children, people milling around outside a market, fishermen at work and villagers sitting down to eat together. But there is also evidence of the Communist rule that remains in place in the isolated country more than 50 years on, in photographs of flag-bearing North Koreans marching en masse. Petr Doubrava was astonished to happen across the atmospheric black and white images in an antique shop he frequents in the Czech town of Pardubice. He said they were taken by a doctor who travelled through the isolated country as a member of a Czechoslovakian expedition in the years after the Korean War ended in 1953. He declined to reveal what he paid for the unique find, saying only that the antiques dealer had handed them over in exchange for some books and 'a few tens of euros'. Simple life: This photograph of villagers catching fish during the 1950s is a far cry from modern pictures emerging from the secretive state; which are more likely to feature military aircraft . Childhood: The photographer captured a group of giggling children in North Korea in the late 1950s . Meal-times: The owner of the Czech antique shop said the grainy black and white shots were sold to him by the son of a photographer . 'I found the set in a dusty antique shop in a Czech town called Pardubice,' Mr Doubrava said. 'The owner of the shop told me that the collection was sold to him by the son of a photographer. 'The photographer was a doctor who had travelled through North Korea between 1955 and 1959. 'His son was forced to sell the images because of mounting debts but as soon as I saw them I knew they were highly interesting. 'The . pictures cover a whole range of topics from schools and education, the . life of the villagers and a communist parade and pictures like this are . extremely rare. 'I go to this . particular antique shop quite frequently. In order to buy the pictures I . swapped them for some books and added a few tens of Euros,' Mr Doubrava said. Housing: Makeshift homes can be seen in this black and white shot taken in North Korea during the 1950s . Atmospheric: Two elderly North Korean men were snapped sitting side by side by the photographer, who travelled through the country between 1955 and 1959 . Insight: A trio of villagers smile for the camera in this shot taken from the rare collection of 1950s images . Tending the land: North Korean girls carry containers on their heads as they work in a field . Communism: North Koreans were captured on camera parading through the streets during the 1950s . The war between South Korea, backed by the UN, and North Korea, supported by China, lasted from June 1950 to July 1953. The Korean peninsula had been ruled by the Empire of Japan until the end of the Second World War. Amid the chaos after the war a Communist state was established under Kim Il-Sung in the North -  which remains under Communist rule to this day. His personal philosophy of self-reliance would become fundamental to the country's development for almost half a century until his death in 1994. Life in isolated North Korea remained behind a veil of secrecy under the rule of Il-Sung's successor Kim Jong-Il which continues today under his son Kim Jong-Un. Assembly: Scores of schoolgirls, all sporting virtually identical haircuts, are seen sitting in rows on the ground in this photograph by the intrepid doctor . Collector: This image shows a row of flags blowing in the breeze on top of a building as men mill around on the ground below . Exchange: The Czech collector swapped some books - and an undisclosed amount of euros - for the pictures . Unique: A snapshot of villagers on board boats off the coast of North Korea . Rural: Horses pull trailers loaded with sticks along a country path in North Korea during the late 1950s . Community: The way the villagers, all clad in scarves and coats, huddle together in this photograph suggest it was taken in winter . Contrast: Modern pictures emerging from the secretive state typically feature military drills being carried out under young leader Kim Jong-Un . Village life: North Koreans young and old are pictured milling around what appears to be a village market . Shadowy: This photo taken inside the secretive state back in the 1950s shows two children with a man in traditional dress . Day's work: The Czech collector stumbled across the photographs in an antique shop in Pardubice . Relations: The North established a Communist government after the end of the Second World War . Fascinating: Two women walk with heavy loads against a backdrop of workers and billowing flags . Conditions: Much of North Korea remains impoverished half a century after these photographs were taken . Post-war: The photographs are believed to have been taken after the end of the Korean War in 1953 .","Grainy black and white photos taken in North Korea in the late 1950s .

Massive attack: China is feared to have been behind cyber attacks on Twitter that gained access to 250,000 private accounts . China is feared to have been behind a massive hacking attack on Twitter that gained access to 250,000 private accounts. The social media company was assessing the full scale of the attack over the weekend - but fears that the hackers may have stolen user names, email addresses and encrypted passwords belonging to all those affected. In recent days American newspapers The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post have also revealed that they have been the targets of sophisticated ‘cyber-attacks’. And there are growing fears that the Government of China officially sponsors a red army of hackers who work ceaselessly to discover not only the trade secrets of Western companies, but also discover details of critical journalists, Chinese dissidents, and delve into national defence and infrastructure systems. Beijing spokesmen deny endorsing any computer hacking but companies falling victims to serious attacks repeatedly say they appear to originate in China. And in 2010 Britain’s strategic defence review made clear for the first time that ‘cyberwar’ was a genuine threat to national security, and had become one our major priorities, alongside combating traditional terrorism. Twitter’s director of information security, Bob Lord, said over the weekend that the massive attack on the social media network ‘was not the work of amateurs, and we do not believe it was an isolated incident’. Mr Lord went on: ‘The attackers were extremely sophisticated, and we believe other companies and organizations have also been recently similarly attacked. ‘For that reason we felt that it was important to publicise this attack while we still gather information, and we are helping government and federal law enforcement in their effort to find and prosecute these attackers to make the Internet safer for all users.’ Experts said the assault on Twitter could have begun with a single Twitter employee’s computer being infiltrated through well-publicised weaknesses in the Java computer language. It would then have spread through the company network. Targeted: In recent days, newspapers The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post say they have been targets of sophisticated 'cyber-attacks' Although Twitter is generally used to publish messages for all the world to see, hacking could enable Chinese agents to discover the true identity of people posting under pseudonyms, or locate where they are posting from. A strong warning of the dangers posed by Chinese hackers comes in a forthcoming book by the executive chairman of internet giant Google, Eric Schmidt, who writes in The Digital Age that Beijing-based cybercrime is a global ‘menace’. The tightly controlled country is the most ‘sophisticated and prolific’ hacker on earth, he says - with Western countries restricted by laws and privacy concerns that discourage hacking. Growing sales of Chinese computer technology around the globe are also making hacking by the country’s employees and residents easier by the day, he suggests. The New York Times and Wall Street Journal both suggested the recent cyberattacks they had fallen victim to involved attempts to spy on journalists monitoring China. Global 'menace': Executive chairman of Google, Eric Schmidt, gives a strong warning of the dangers posed by Chinese hackers . The Bloomberg financial news service is also said to have been hacked immediately after running a story about the fortunes amassed by relatives of China’s probably president-to-be in March Xi Jinping. China is obsessed with its own cyber-security, and does its best to prevent free access to the rest of the world wide web - fearing the social media could spark Arab Spring-style calls for democracy, and endanger the Communist Party’s iron grip on power. Twitter and Facebook are banned there, and on Weibo, China’s own version of Twitter, there are said to be 1,000 censors employed full time to delete as many as 10 million politically dangerous messages a day. Another 300,000 volunteers are said to be paid 4p a post to spread positive propaganda about the Communist Party. British and American intelligence agencies are anxiously hiring their own computer experts in a bid to build up defences, and devise potential counter-attacks, against ruthless foreign hackers. Experts say Western military attacks could in future lead to retaliation not on the battlefield, but in computer assaults on the National Grid or on water supply systems. Swiftly deleting abusive tweets may save offenders from being brought before court, the country’s leading prosecutor said. Keir Starmer, director of public prosecutions, said it was 'relevant' for police to consider whether an offending tweet had been quickly deleted from the micro-blogging site. Speaking to Sky’s Dermot Murnaghan, he said he was holding a three-month consultation about the plan. Libellous tweets, or messages which broke court orders or were threatening, would still face prosecution regardless, he added.","Twitter fears user names, email addresses and passwords have been stolen .

The much-criticised head of the NHS insisted today that he had to travel first-class to do his job. Sir David Nicholson racked up nearly £50,000 in expenses claims last year on top of his £211,000 annual salary. Yet he refused to explain to a committee of MPs why he has apparently been billing the taxpayer to go home to his wife at weekends by first-class rail travel. Sir David is defying growing calls to resign over his role in the Mid Staffordshire Hospital scandal, where hundreds died through neglect at a time when he was head of the regional health body. The Prime Minister has insisted he is doing ‘a very good job’, but many MPs, and some senior members in the Department of Health, believe his position is untenable. He was quizzed by MPs on the Public Accounts Committee over his expenses which last year totalled £48,900 – the cost of employing two nurses for a year. Intriguingly, they included 41 first-class trips to Birmingham, where his 35-year-old wife lives with their baby daughter. Sir David, 57, had claimed on his expenses forms to be ‘attending an official meeting’. But many of the trips took place on a Friday, prompting speculation he was billing the taxpayer to see his wife at the weekend. Public dislike: Protestors campaign for the resignation of Sir David Nicholson on Abingdon Green, London . There have been repeated calls for the NHS chief executive to resign since the Mid-Staffs hospital scandal where hundreds of patients died needlessly after being 'routinely neglected' Margaret Hodge, chairman of the . committee, yesterday asked Sir David: ‘Were you paid by the taxpayer for . first-class travel on Fridays to Birmingham?’ He refused to answer the question . directly and replied: ‘To do that job I had to travel a lot around the . country and spent two or three nights away from home. It was simply . impossible for me to do, without being able to work during that period, . get value out of my time. The only way I could guarantee that is to have . first-class travel. I have been open and transparent about it. My . employers completely understand why I do it.’ Mrs Hodge pressed him further and said: ‘Some of us manage to work without travelling first-class I have to say that to you. In fact, train journeys are a really . good place for most of us to work without travelling first-class. What . raises eyebrows is that you were going home on a Friday.’ Sir David refused to deny that he had . indeed been claiming expenses to go home at the weekend. Instead, he . stated: ‘I agreed with my department in 2010 I would have three working . bases – Birmingham, London and Leeds – and my travel to all those places . would be paid for to enable me to do all the three jobs.’ Mrs Hodge replied: ‘Well at a time when we’re all in this together I think you should reconsider whether it’s appropriate.’ Chris Heaton-Harris (left) and Margaret Hodge (right) were two MPs that grilled Sir David Nicholson today .

The search for the body of missing April Jones will finish next month after the biggest police search operation the UK has ever seen. Five-year-old April Jones disappeared from the housing estate where she lived in Machynlleth, mid Wales, on October 1. Since then six-month search involving a methodical examination of thousands of acres of rugged terrain around the town has continued unabated. Bad weather has forced specialist search teams to cancel the on-going search operation this week. Search teams of more than 130 people are due to rest over the Easter break as the six month anniversary of April's abduction approaches. Now Dyfed Powys Police have announced that the search operation will be concluded by the end of next month. A reactive team of search officers will remain on duty ready to respond to any new information which may emerge. More than 23 square miles and 300 separate locations have been searched during the six-month operation. ‘The terrain is extremely challenging. The mountains, gorges, streams and waterfalls in the area mean extra care has to be taken and specialist safety equipment has to be worn,’ a Dyfed Powys Police spokesman said today. ‘The force made a commitment to search until all viable lines of inquiry were complete.’ Police divers searched the river Dyfi in Ceinws, Mid Wales, for the body of April Jones, who went missing on October 1 2012 .

The pair - who only met in October - are seen in their wedding finery in pictures published by Hello! magazine. And former Dancing On Ice star Beharry tells the mag that he and his dentist wife Venice Mallissa Noel, who is known as Mallissa, already have a family on the way. The Grenada-born soldier said: ‘It's a little sooner than planned, but we are over the moon. ‘Mallissa and I felt strongly that it was important to marry before our baby arrives. 'I didn't grow up with a mum and dad who were together and all my life I've said I don't want my child to say the same and that I want them to know they've got that solid foundation.’ The couple had their second ceremony at the Gardens Hotel in Bloomsbury' Invited guests included Johnson's partner on the 2011 series of the ice-dancing show Jodeyne Higgins. Beharry was the first VC recipient in more than 30 years, for two acts of bravery. In the first he led a patrol to safety after being ambushed and under heavy fire, and in the other he saved the lives of several colleagues despite suffering brain and facial injuries from a grenade.

She looked beautiful.’ Their reception included a performance from the Military Wives Choir during a bash in the Senate House at University College . London and letters of congratulations were read out including one from the Queen and one from the Prince of Wales.

A law graduate who masterminded a series of ‘cash for crash’ insurance scams was jailed for two years today. Mohammed Javid, 28, claimed £80,000 in a number of ‘highly significant frauds’ including faked car accidents, burst water pipes and false benefit claims. The father-of-one even claimed to be renting a house he owned back to himself, and that a fictitious passenger had sustained injuries from one of the crashes. Sentencing at Bristol Crown Court, Recorder Waddington said his crimes were committed out of pure greed. He said: ‘You spent a great deal of time and effort trying to extract money from the state and from various insurance companies in a number of different ways. ‘I am only able to conclude these offences were committed more out of greed on your part than what can be said to be necessity. ‘You are a person who is not destitute and you have got yourself into trouble you are now in by engaging in this course of conduct. ‘There is only one option on the fact and that is a prison sentence.’ The court heard that Javid, from Blackburn, Lancashire, used a number of false names to claim money from insurance companies and the Department of Work and Pensions. Javid staged three car accidents and claimed a total of more than £40,000 from insurers - although he had only received £4,200 before charges were brought. In one case in March 2011, Javid, along with brother-in-law and co-defendant Shabeer Ahmad, 30, created a crash between a Vauxhall Astra and a Toyota Celica and claimed £2,500 for the written-off car, of which only £1,500 was awarded. In November 2010 Javid claimed more than £18,000 for the fictional hire of a Mercedes, car repairs and injuries to a passenger who did not exist. As evidence of his claim Javid submitted fictitious invoices and told insurers his passenger, who was in fact nowhere near the scene of the accident, had sustained serious injuries which needed compensation. He was awarded £2,300 for the injuries but insurers refused to pay for the rest. Stephen Dent, prosecuting, told the court: ‘This is a case which involves some highly significant frauds in a variety of ways. ‘The . defendant claimed the other vehicle had driven into him, but on . questioning the other driver said it had in fact been the other way . around. ‘He also made a claim for the damages, vehicle storage costs and personal injury for a passenger. ‘He submitted fictitious invoices for a storage company, the number of which was his own telephone number. ‘The . other driver was asked about a passenger in the car and he said there . had been no one else in the car with Mr Javid at the time of the . accident. At Bristol Crown Court Recorder Waddington said Mohammed Javid's crimes were committed out of pure greed . ‘The potential passenger was contacted and he confirmed he had been nowhere near the car at the time.’ In the final crash Javid pulled a female driver over to the side of the road and accused her of driving into him and causing a bump on his Vauxhall Astra van. But the driver disputed the claim and on investigation it was found that the bump had been on the van when Javid had bought it. Javid, who ran a businesses in the motor trade, also used a false name to submit a claim for £19,521, from his household insurers for water damage to a property he owned. He then made a further claim, using the name Mr Patel, for rent of £600 a month while the home was being repaired. Mr Dent said: ‘He had rented out his own house to himself and claimed the cost back from the insurance company.’ The court heard how Javid and his wife, Sabina Coldrink, 27, a third defendant in the case, applied for benefits from the state. Javid asked for housing benefits on a property he claimed he lived in, but had in fact rented to someone else, and that he was unfit to work because he suffered from epilepsy. As a result he received regular mortgage payments from the DWP and was awarded £19,000 in Disability Living Allowance. Javid admitted six charges of false representation and one of handling stolen goods. David Tenkin, defending, said his client had genuine remorse for his actions and fully admitted the claims were fraudulent. He said: ‘There is genuine remorse. He fully admits all of the matters in respect of his guilty pleas. ‘He doesn’t wish to minimalise his role and he accepts all of them. ‘At the time he asserts he was in financial difficulties and he had responsibility for a large number of family members.’ Mr Temkin said Javid’s father, mother and brother were in court to support him. ‘They are a well respected family and they feel an enormous sense of shame.’ Mr Tenkin added that the crimes were not that of an organised, planned criminal, but that there was instead ‘a lack of sophistication’. Javid, who sat in the dock with Ahmad, was ordered to pay £500 prosecution costs. He remained emotionless as his sentence was passed. Ahmad, a former insurance firm worker of Hambrook, Bristol, leaded guilty to one count of fraud by false representation totalling £1,500. He was handed a community sentence for a year, with 150 hours unpaid work. Coldrink, also of Blackburn, is due to appear at Bristol Crown Court next month to enter pleas on charges of benefit fraud.","Mohammed Javid, 28,  was jailed for two years at Bristol Crown Court .

A terminally ill mother's dying wish was fulfilled after she celebrated her son's first birthday with a traditional party with cake, balloons and a bouncy castle. Jorie Rogers has a rare form of cancer which causes tumors all over her body and was told she would be made infertile by her radiation treatment. Despite the odds, she gave birth to 'miracle' baby Tristan last year. But Mrs Rogers was told she would not live to see Tristan turn two, so she wanted to make his first birthday special. Terminally ill cancer sufferer Jorie Rogers wanted to make the first birthday of her son Tristan special because it is likely to be the last she spends with him . Many happy returns: The special birthday party had everything a child could wish for including clowns and balloons . After Mrs Rogers, who lives in Missouri, struggled with mounting medical bills, it seemed unlikely that the party for Tristan, who has Down's Syndrome, would go ahead. Mrs Rogers' wish was granted however, when an Illinois charity stepped in and threw Tristan a carnival to celebrate his first year. The party included clowns, balloons, a . bouncy castle and a colorful birthday cake. Mrs Rogers said: ‘It's so . much more than I could have hoped for. It's amazing,’ She . told KSDK: ‘It's very special because not only are we celebrating my . son's first year and everything that he had to go through to get here, . but it's the one birthday that I'll get with him.

She said: 'My cancer has unfortunately . progressed to a point where there's really nothing else that we can do. We've pretty much run the gamut and tried everything. A colorful iced cake was made especially for the occasion - which Tristan seemed to thoroughly enjoy judging by the smile on his face . It was the first and last birthday that Missouri mom Jorie Rogers would likely spend with her son, Tristan . 'So we're just going to live out the rest of the days as best we can and be as happy as we can with the time we have left. Although Tristan will be too young to . remember the party, Mrs Rogers wanted him to have photos and videos of . the day as keepsakes after she passes away. Loved ones gather to celebrate Tristan's first birthday for what is likely the only birthday his mother will get to celebrate with him . She added: ‘I want him to be able to look back on videos and pictures from today and hear the stories about today, and for him to know how much his mom loved him. And for him to know how hard his mom fought to be here for him.’ The charity which organized the party, 3 Little Birds 4 Life, has also fixed a young man’s ‘chemo teeth’ and helped a person with brain cancer go to Disney World.","Jorie Rogers told she would be infertile, before giving birth to Tristan .

A German artist has made an unsettling exhibition of 'matchstick men' which show blackened out human faces atop huge matches. Wolfgang Stiller had been experimenting with leftover art materials in his studio when he began his matchstick project with molds of Chinese faces and bamboo. As the site-specific installation, entitled Matchstick Men, Stiller used thick pieces of lumber to make the sculptures look more like real matchsticks. German artist Wolfgang Stiller created the matchstick men installation by experimenting with leftover materials . The Matchstick Men were created using the moulds of human faces on top of sturdy pieces of lumber to create the effect of oversized matches . The installation includes a variety of bent, warped, and burnt pieces with haunting human faces, as well as oversized matchboxes. The installation is not a travelling exhibition and Stiller has created numerous exhibitions in different places. The Matchstick Men will be on display at Python Gallery in Zurich as part of the show Burnout which runs until April 20 . Matchbox coffin: The artist insists that his Matchstick Men exhibition is not intended to reflect a view of China and says it is open to interpretation . The installation is not a travelling exhibition and Wolfgang Stiller says he will make more Matchstick Men while he is still able to create fresh collections . He said he will continue to make new Matchstick Men installations as long as he is able to come up with fresh ideas for how to present them. Stiller, who has lived in New York, Shanghai, Beijing and Berlin, leaves creative interpretation of the Matchstick Men exhibition up to the viewer. The 52-year-old artist said: 'The installation can appear like a battlefield or just like some playground where someone played around with matches and dropped them. All the heads I've used so far are from Chinese people. 'This sometimes leads to the assumption that this is a criticism of the Chinese government. One can read it that way, but I think this metaphor could be used for any western system as well. 'The matchboxes could be simply seen as formal elements within the installation, as coffins, or simply as matchboxes. I actually like to keep it open since I don't like art that leaves no space for one's own imagination.' The Matchstick Men will be on display at Python Gallery in Zurich as part of the show 'Burnout' which runs until April 20. Some of the Matchstick Men are discarded over the floor, while others appear tucked away in an oversized matchbox .","Wolfgang Stiller made matchsticks by experimenting with leftover materials .

A doctor was today spared jail after he drunkenly attacked a policeman - despite having been convicted of similar offences twice before. Mark Alner, a consultant radiologist at a hospital, kicked PC Rob Hoskins in the head while he was being arrested for refusing to take a breath test during a traffic stop. The 49-year-old, who has been struck off by the GMC, had previously been handed a conditional discharge after being convicted of two offences of assaulting a police officer. Nonetheless, Alner walked free from Bournemouth Magistrates' Court after the latest attack and was ordered to pay his victim just £150 in compensation, prompting fury from police leaders. Clive Chamberlain, the chairman of Dorset Police Federation, said: 'How many times does somebody have to assault a police officer for them to be sent to prison? 'There needs to be a strong sentencing deterrent so that people think twice before they hit a public servant like a police officer, fireman or ambulance paramedic, going about their job. 'I am shocked at the lack of sentence. The money is irrelevant to the officer involved. In any case, what is £150 to a doctor who I'm sure earns a good wage?' Alner, from Lytchett Minster in Dorset, was being sentenced not only for assaulting PC Hoskins but also attacking a train driver in a separate incident. Heather Jackson, prosecuting, told the court that the doctor lost his temper with rail staff at Poole after missing his stop in July 2011. He was 'ranting and raving and swearing' and started banging on the train, and when the train driver asked him to stop Alner hit him, she said. Walked free: The consultant was given a fine and banned from driving at Bournemouth Magistrates' Court . The incident involving PC Hoskins came in May last year, when the officer stopped him as he was driving his Vauxhall Zafira in Weymouth. Another policeman noticed Alner was 'unsteady on his feet' and had an open can of cider in car, so asked him to provide a breath test, Ms Jackson said. The doctor refused and lost his temper, she told the court, adding: 'He struggled with officers and was swearing and aggressive. He began kicking out with his feet.' PC Hoskins said: 'I tried to grab him by his legs to control them, and the male kicked me in the right side of my face.' Alner has since lost his job at the Dorset County Hospital in Dorchester and been struck off by the General Medical Council.. He admitted charges of assault by beating in relation to the train driver, assaulting a constable in the execution of his duty and failing to provide a specimen of breath. Jonathan Morrissey said in mitigation that his client had been badly affected by recent personal problems and was now attending Alcoholics Anonymous. District judge Roger House accepted that Alner had had 'more than his fair share of major difficulties' as he ordered him to pay £150 compensation and £170 in court costs and banned him from driving for three years.","Dr Mark Alner attacked PC Rob Hoskins after he had been drinking .

The U.S. Marine who pulled down a giant statue of Saddam Hussein in one of the most iconic moments of the Iraq war has spoken of his doubts about the controversial conflict. Edward Chin's face was seen around the world after he climbed up onto the dictator's image in Baghdad and brought it crashing to the ground. But now he asks what the U.S. was doing in the Middle East in the first place - and blames the West for abandoning the country to 'radicals and insurgents' in the aftermath of the invasion. Iconic: Edward Chin as he fastened a noose around a statue of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad in 2003 . Destruction: The noose was attached to a tank which dragged the 40ft statue to the ground . Mr Chin, 34, signed up to the Marines in 1999 hoping to earn money for college. The U.S. declared war on Saddam's dictatorial regime in March 2003 - 10 years ago last week - and quickly overwhelmed his under-powered troops. On April 9, 2003, Mr Chin was part of a troop of Marines who arrived in Baghdad's Firdos Square, which was dominated by a 40ft statue of the long-serving leader. He climbed up onto the statue and tied a noose around its neck which was then attached to a powerful M88 tank, which brought the icon down to cheers from the Iraqi bystanders, who then hit the statues with their shoes as a sign of disrespect. Patrol: But Mr Chin, left, now says he does not know the point of the U.S. invasion of Iraq . However, 10 years later Mr Chin is not sure that there was any reason for him to be in Iraq at all, asking: 'What did we go there for?' He told the Daily News: 'As Marines, we just do our jobs. We go where we are told. We hope that our leaders make the right decisions.' The Marine from Brooklyn in New York says it was no surprise when Saddam's much-heralded weapons of mass destruction turned out not to exist. 'We weren't really looking for them,' he claimed - even though WMDs were supposed to be the justification for the war, which claimed the lives of nearly 4,500 U.S. troops and 179 British fighters. Hero: Mr Chin pictured during a New York Mets game at Shea Stadium after his moment in the spotlight . Mr Chin spreads the blame for the apparent failure of the West's mission in Iraq evenly between the U.S. leadership and the Iraqi people themselves. 'I feel they really don't know what they want,' he told the Daily News. 'They didn't want Saddam in power. But they don't seem to want democracy either.' The former Marine criticised the West for presiding over a brutal civil war stoked up by Iran, saying: 'We let it fall back into the hands of the radicals and insurgents.' In the decade since the invasion, the country has been plagued by a conflict between the majority Shi'ites - backed by Iran's theocratic government - and the Sunnis who dominated Iraq during Saddam's time despite being in the minority. Dictator: After the fall of Saddam Hussein, Iraq descended into civil war stoked up by Iran . Since leaving the military, Mr Chin has worked hard to rebuild his life - despite becoming embroiled in a divorce, he found love again and is now engaged. He is working as an architect - and one commission in particular reminded him of his old life, and of how lucky he was to leave Iraq unhurt. Poignantly, Mr Chin was part of a team which designed a new home for Brendan Marrocco, a soldier from New York who lost his arms and legs while serving in the country.","Edward Chin's face was seen around the world during 2003 invasion .

A former soldier has been jailed after police found a rocket launcher hidden under his bed while they were raiding a cannabis factory in his flat. Mark Chalcroft served in the Territorial Army for 12 years, and kept the weapon capable of destroying tanks 'as a kind of souvenir', Northampton Crown Court heard. He claimed he believed that it had been deactivated and was no longer dangerous, but a judge said it could in fact have been lethal 'if it fell into the wrong hands'. Lethal: This rocket launcher capable of blowing up a tank was found under the bed of ex-soldier Mark Chalcroft . Police visited Chalcroft's one-bedroom flat in Northampton after smelling cannabis during an investigation of an unrelated incident in the building. They discovered a marijuana factory with 28 cannabis plants - and were stunned to come across a 3ft rocket launcher hidden under the military enthusiast's bed. The L1A3B1 weapon was still capable of firing destructive missiles, even though it had a stamp certifying that it was deactivated. Chalcroft, 46, was arrested and charged with cannabis cultivation and possession of a rocket launcher. Last week he pleaded guilty to both charges and was sentenced to two years in prison. Sentence: Chalcroft was handed a two-year jail sentence by a judge at Northampton Crown Court . Judge John Bray told him: 'This is a serious weapon, which could have very serious consequences if it fell into the wrong hands. 'I accept your basis of plea, that you purchased the weapon as a kind of souvenir and never intended to use it. 'It has a deactivation stamp on it, which suggests it could not be fired. 'But as a former member of the Territorial Army you should have checked if this was a potentially dangerous weapon or not.' No rockets or ammunition were found at the flat. The L1A3B1 is the British version of the M72 Light Anti-tank Weapon used by the U.S. Army in the Vietnam War and based on the design of the Bazooka. It is operated by a single soldier and is capable of destroying tanks and other buildings at a range of 200m. It is unclear how Chalcroft acquired the active weapon, although deactivated versions of the rocket launcher are widely available online for less than £100. Rebecca Wade, prosecuting, said: 'There was a stamp on it, which would indicate deactivation, but experts said that hadn't taken place. 'He [the expert] said it was still capable of firing rockets, although there was nothing found within the property that could have been used to do so.' Defending Matthew Lowe said Chalcroft 'genuinely and honestly believed the weapon had been deactivated'. He added: 'This is a man who had been in the Territorial Army for some 12 years and had something of a fascination with all things weaponry, and as a memento or a souvenir he purchased it.'","Mark Chalcroft kept L1A3B1 weapon under the bed in his Northampton flat .

Britain's largest surviving artillery piece is due to make an historic journey to the Netherlands to mark the 300th anniversary of the Treaty of Utrecht. The Breach Loading 18-inch Rail Howitzer gun serial number L1 is one of just twelve railway guns left in the world. It was manufactured by the Elswick Ordnance Company set up in 1864. The gun, which weighs 200 tons, has been on display at Larkhill, Wiltshire, since 2008 but today it began its 387-mile journey to the Dutch Railway museum. Britain's largest surviving artillery piece, the Breach Loading 18inch Rail Howitzer gun, is being transported to the Netherlands for an exhibition to mark the 300th anniversary of the Utrecht Treaty . In 1940 an 18-inch Rail Howitzer Gun (pictured here at Ashbury Station), was stationed at Bishopsbourne, Kent on the Elham to Canterbury line as a defence against possible German invasion . There, the gun will be displayed as part of their War and Peace exhibition to commemorate the end of the Spanish War of Succession in 1713. In preparation for the move the artillery piece, which was in service between 1920 and 1945, has undergone restoration work after a campaign to return it to good condition. There are only twelve surviving railway guns in the world but the 200 ton Breach Loading 18inch Howitzer Serial No L1 is the largest surviving of all British artillery pieces . Today the Howitzer gun began its 387-mile journey to the Dutch Railway Museum where it will be part of the War and Peace exhibition . The War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714) was fought between two alliances of European powers, including a divided Spain, over who had the right to succeed Charles II as king of Spain. In 1704 an Anglo-Dutch force captured Gibraltor from Spain during the war of the Spanish succession. The territory was then ceded to Britain under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. It was signed by representatives of Louis XIV of France and Philip V of Spain, and representatives of Queen Anne of Great Britain, the Duke of . Savoy, the King of Portugal and the United Provinces on the other. Sergeant Maj Nick Shipton told the BBC it took up to five hours to get the gun off the carriageway and onto a truck. 'It's a complex beast. The size, . weight and the fact that it has been together for a few years causes its . own issues. But we've done a lot of pre-preparatory work to make sure . it can be split,' he said. 'It's most certainly going to be an abnormal load.' Howitzer artillery pieces typically have relatively short barrels and use comparatively small propellant charges to propel missiles high into the air. The barrels were built during the First . World War but were completed too late to see action. They were later used to . test the accuracy of the 18-inch Howitzer in Shoeburyness, Essex. Their relatively short range of around 13 miles meant that after the First World War the five guns produced were put into storage because longer range weapons were needed. The Howitzer's range was insufficient for cross-Channel firing and hence it was never fired in action. In late 1940 one 18-inch howitzer was brought out of retirement and fitted onto its 95 ton proofing sleigh. It was deployed on the railway mounting Boche Buster which had been used in the First World War to carry a 14-inch gun. The Breach Loading 18-inch Rail Howitzer gun serial number L1 was in service from 1920 to 1945. It was one of five made in Britain by the Elswick Ordnance Company. It weighs nearly 200 tonnes and its barrel measures 52ft. The gun's shells weighed nearly 180 stone. Elevation varied between 0° - 40° and its effective range was 13 miles. It takes five hours to shift the gun from its carriageway over to the truck which transports it. The gun was stationed at Bishopsbourne in Kent on the Elham to Canterbury Line as a coast defence gun. It remained there until 1943 as a precaution against possible German invasion. Barrel No L1 was the only one of Britain's railway guns to avoid being dismantled and scrapped in the early 1960s. It was was sent back to Shoeburyness to test fire the efficacy of 1,000lb Bunker Buster Bombs before finally being retired in November 1959. The Howitzer and proofing sleigh were moved to Woolwich, the then home of the Gunners, in June 1991, where it was gifted to the Royal Artillery Historical Trust. After 17 years it was moved to Larkhill in 2008. In the Netherlands the gun will form the centrepiece of the exhibition, to open on March 30 in a grand official opening ceremony involving many dignitaries. It will remain there until September this year, before returning to the UK to a location yet to be confirmed.","Breach Loading 18inch Rail Howitzer will travel 300 miles to the Netherlands .

A brave woman who was sexually assaulted when she was a child by a predatory rapist known as the Pied Piper waived her anonymity to ensure he was jailed today for 25 years. Darren Purchase, who  lived above a sweet shop in order to . have access to young victims, dragged Helen Alexander into his home in Worcester . when she was 10-years-old and sexually assaulted her on the sofa. Ms Alexander, now 38, stayed silent for decades before agreeing to be interviewed by police when they contacted her as a potential victim. Brave: Helen Alexander waived her anonymity to urge other sex abuse victims to come forward . A court heard the attacker would befriend youngsters by buying them sweets, cigarettes and alcohol, then subject them to horrific sexual assaults. The 44-year-old abused at least eight children over three decades - beginning when he himself was a child of just 13. Purchase was finally arrested after his male victim discovered that he was still spending time around children, and contacted the police in an effort to stop him attacking anyone else. He was convicted of abusing seven female . victims and one male between 1984 and 2011 - and one victim described . him as a 'Pied Piper' figure who had scarred her for life. Jailed: Darren Purchase has been imprisoned for abusing a series of young victims . The serial rapist was sentenced to 25 years in prison after being convicted on 18 counts - including rape, indecent assault and buggery - at Worcester Crown Court. Speaking after the sentencing, Ms Alexander spoke of her ordeal. She said: 'He knew my brother, I didn't have much contact with him other . than saying hello on my way back from school. 'Then one day I was on my way back, still in my uniform, when he called me over to sit on the step outside his house. 'We were talking and he was asking lots of questions about school - I said, ""What do you bloody want to know for?"" 'He said if I swore again he would smack my bottom. Being a cheeky kid I said, ""I can bloody well swear if I want to."" 'At that he grabbed me by the arm and . pulled me into the house. He took me into the front room and put me on . the sofa where he proceeded to sexually assault me. 'I managed to kick him away and escape . eventually. I screamed that I would tell my mum what had happened but . he threatened to tell her I had been swearing if I did.' Ms Alexander said she is still terrified when she thinks of what Purchase did to her. 'When I saw him in court after all . these years I had heart palpitations,' she said. 'I held it together . during my evidence but when I came out of court collapsed in a pile . outside. 'The damage to my mental health has . been long-lasting. I was walking through Worcester with my son several . years ago when I saw him again. I almost collapsed. 'He was walking along and had all . these children around him, following him. The best way of describing it . was that he was like the Pied Piper.' Ms Alexander urged anyone else with historical sexual abuse allegations to contact police. She said: 'From telling my story I've . had lots of people say, ""That happened to me too."" I would just say . don't keep it bottled up, talk to someone about it.' Alex Warren, prosecuting, told the court . that one of Purchase's victims had come to view him as a 'big brother' figure, adding that another victim had been 'excited' about visiting the . defendant's flat when she found it was above a sweet shop. Judge Robert Jucker told him: 'This is a remarkable catalogue of sexual offending by any standards.' He added that the rapist had 'enticed' his victims by plying them with treats, in one case winning over an entire family to gain their trust. 'You worked your way into the family's affections by plying them with food and cigarettes,' the judge said. 'Through [the male victim] you befriended a group of his friends who were significantly younger than yourself. 'You were the man that could supply them with a car and cigarettes - and you did.' Speaking after the case, Detective Inspector Jon Wallis, of Worcester CID, said: 'Purchase abused boys, girls and women and seems to have been completely indiscriminate in whom he targeted; except that most of his victims were vulnerable in some way and Purchase ruthlessly took advantage of that. 'We first became aware of his offending when his teenage victim from the 1980s got together enough courage to contact the police and report what he had suffered. 'He had not only been sexually abused, but to make him compliant, Purchase introduced him to glue sniffing, alcohol and cannabis at a young age. 'He also exposed him to hardcore pornography, a recurring theme in Purchase's crimes. 'I want to thank all those who supported our prosecution, took part in the trial and had the strength to come to court and relive those terrible experiences. 'I particularly want to thank the woman Purchase systematically raped over several years and has blighted her life. 'Their evidence means we could put a stop to Purchase's relentless offending and, I think, stop many others from becoming his victims. 'I want any other victims of historic sexual abuse to know that they can have the confidence to contact the police about what they have suffered. 'We will treat their reports seriously, prosecute where possible and at the very least refer them to support services.'","Darren Purchase, 44, abused eight people over three decades .

The project follows a pilot scheme last year, which saw more than 150 police taking part in computer-based courses. That was judged so successful that a second wave of courses will run this year. An internal briefing document seen by The Independent states another of the goals of the programme is to 'change public perception' of the force. Language test: New Scotland Yard, the headquarters of the Metropolitan Police in London . It said that so far, the most popular courses taken up so far are Arabic, Polish and Spanish. A Met Police spokesman said: 'Policing a city as diverse as London requires our officers… to engage with different communities and the languages spoken with them. 'We have recently offered officers and staff the opportunity to develop their language skills in order to improve direct communication between police and the communities we serve.' There is already a list of 1,000 Yard staff who are already registered as having specialist language skills because of their family background or previous experience. The courses, run with the Chartered Institute of Linguists, range from mainstream European languages such as French, German and Italian to Bulgarian, Korean, Lithuanian, Romanian, Russian, Somali, Turkish and Vietnamese. Candidates are even offered the chance to learn rare languages like Amharic, Hebrew and Shona. The institute's website says: 'Candidates should make themselves as familiar as possible with police terminology before taking the test. 'Successful candidates will have outstanding skills. However, though the standard is high, the Metropolitan Police Test is available to everybody regardless of qualifications or experience.' The Met expects to fill the 120 places available this year for the courses, which culminate in a three-day assessment. Opinion among the rank and file, once they have recovered from the shock of swapping charge sheets for role-playing as a Bengali businessman, seems positive. One officer told the Independent: 'Probably the hardest course I have done for 20 years in the Met. But also probably the best and very rewarding.'","The Met's  31,000 officers offered the chance of taking special lessons .

A spurned lover is facing jail after being charged for taking revenge on his ex by putting out sex adverts for her address on Craigslist - relentlessly attracting dozens of men from across the country. Kenneth Kuban, 61, an employee at the Library of Congress, has been accused of felony stalking after posting the 'Casual Encounters' adverts on the website, according to Smoking Gun. He is accused of directing men to the 64-year-old woman's Virginia home, posting pictures of her and details of her address. Accused: According to reports Kenneth Kuban, pictured, is facing charges of stalking after allegedly posting sex adverts for his ex-girlfriend on Craigslist . According to police, she was soon inundated with men - some from out of state - looking for the 'senior lady' mentioned in the post. Kuban is accused of posing as his ex in email exchanges with the 'visitors'. He wrote he was a 'senior lady' seeking to 'meet a gentleman in his 50s that can give me some pleasuring.' The harassment got so bad the woman was forced to install security fences and cameras to ward the men off, according to officers. Police also reported being called out on multiple occasions to 'chase away the men who had been enticed by these personal ads'. The unidentified victim also put signs up outside her house warning any 'visitors' they were trespassing if they were responding to Craigslist adverts.

In exchanges through the site they were told to park by the woman's mailbox and she would meet them. Police claim the harassment began when the woman brought her six month relationship with Kuban to an end. The woman previously attempted to get restraining orders against Kuban over the Craigslist posts, according to officers. The police report states the ads led to 'random men, often traveling from other States, to appear at [the victim's] property, looking to have sexual relations with her'. It added: '[The woman] spends a good portion of her time searching Craigslist and ‘flagging’ these ads as inappropriate.' Kuban's work computer was seized by investigators as part of their search for evidence. He works as a preservationist at the Library of Congress’s facility in Culpeper, Virginia, according to the police report. He was arrested on Friday and is next due in court on April 1, if convicted he faces up to five years in prison.","Kenneth Kuban is accused of carrying out a Craigslist revenge plot against his ex where he advertised her for sex and gave out her address .

The mystery surrounding the death of David Hockney's personal assistant has deepened after a post-mortem examination failed to determine how he died. Dominic Elliott, 23, died in hospital on Sunday morning after being taken ill at the artist's house in Bridlington, East Yorkshire on Saturday night. The keen rugby player, who was a close friend of Mr Hockney, is said to have had a family history of heart disease, but the post-mortem did not find 'obvious natural causes' for the young man's sudden death. Friends: Renowned artist David Hockney (left) employed keen sportsman Dominic Elliott (right) as an assistant . Death: Mr Elliott fell ill at the artist's house (pictured) in Bridlington, East Yorkshire on Saturday night . A spokesman for Humberside Police . said today: 'A post-mortem examination was carried out on the body of . 23-year-old Dominic Elliott yesterday at Hull Royal Infirmary mortuary . and it showed no obvious natural causes for his death. 'Further tests will now be carried out, the results of which will not be known for some weeks. 'Mr Elliott's family has been fully updated by Humberside Police.' Officers are continuing to . investigate how Mr Elliott became ill before he was taken to Scarborough . Hospital, apparently by Mr Hockney's partner John Fitzherbert. He worked as a personal assistant to . the 75-year-old painter, setting up equipment and helping in his studio, . and was the subject of more than one portrait by the artist. Tragedy: Mr Hockney's partner John Fitzherbert, left, and sister Margaret, right, outside the painter's home . Mr Elliott had been out with friends . and was staying at the house overnight when he was taken ill and driven . to hospital, where he died. It is not known whether Mr Hockney was . at the property in Bridlington when Mr Elliott . collapsed, but he is understood to be in the UK and not at his Los . Angeles residence. Mr Hockney, who is worth around . £37million, is likely to be interviewed by police along with Mr . Elliott’s friends and colleagues. Pictured: David Hockney, 75, painted a portrait of his assistant Dominic Elliott, 23, in 2008 . A police spokesman said: ‘This is a . sudden death and we will have to speak to people who worked or lived . with the person who died, whether a world famous artist or a next door . neighbour.’ Mr Elliott, who worked full-time for . the artist and had even featured in a portrait painted by him, was a . keen rugby player and described as ‘big, strong and fit’. But his GP father died of a heart . attack in 2001 aged only 42 and Mr Elliott had in the past complained of . chest pains. Doctors had warned him to curb his drinking over fears he . may have the same heart condition as his father, a friend said. Police said there were no signs of . violence at Mr Hockney’s house. Mr Fitzherbert, who is in his early 60s, . is reported to have driven Mr Elliott 20 miles to Scarborough General . Hospital. He was said to have been ‘vomiting’ and seriously ill  when he arrived at casualty at 6am on Sunday. He died . shortly afterwards and hospital staff contacted Humberside Police. Officers spent several hours at the house on Sunday morning and are . understood to have spoken to Mr Hockney, 75. A police spokesman said they were ‘undertaking . enquiries to establish events leading to the death’. Mr Elliott, who had known Mr Hockney . since childhood, began working for him as a full-time general studio . assistant about two years ago after quitting his university course. Outgoing: Mr Elliott played hockey and rugby and was said to have been in the East Riding Young Farmers Club . Sportsman: Mr Elliott (right) is pictured playing for Bridlington Rugby Club against Heath last November . Mr Hockney’s spokesman Erica Bolton . said the artist was ‘incredibly upset’, adding: ‘He is, like everyone . else, in a state of shock.’ She said Mr Elliott was ‘a very important . person’ to Mr Hockney. Mr Elliott lived in a shared flat in . Bridlington and his solicitor mother Karen Kent lives in a bungalow on . the outskirts of the town. He had two sisters – Beth, 25, and Poppy, 21 – . and a 13-year-old brother, Max. Talented: This 2004 painting Four Roads and Cornfields is a prime example of Hockney's much-loved artwork . Bradford-born David Hockney's colourful paintings often showcase landscape of his native Yorkshire or his adopted home in California. Hockney was an important . contributor to the Pop Art movement of the 1960s and one of the most . influential British artists of the 20th century. He was the subject of a major exhibition at the Royal Academy in London last year with an exhibition of his large scale landscapes. The artist is famous for artworks such as A Bigger Splash, a vivid depiction of a Los Angeles swimming pool, and the portrait Mr And Mrs Clark And Percy. In recent years he has been exploring the possibilities of using an iPad for his artworks. His print from 2008 of 'Dominic Elliott' (seen above) shows his ginger-haired assistant dressed in blue trousers and short sleeve top sat on a chair, staring straight ahead. His grandmother Betty Kent, 84, from . Boston, Lincolnshire, said Mr Elliott had been out with ‘arty types’ on . Saturday night. She said: ‘He’d been to his mother’s in the afternoon as . his washing machine was broken and he needed his clothes as he was . going out with his mates.’ Mr Elliott’s grandfather Walter Elliott, 83, said: ‘I don’t know what happened. My suspicion is he had too much to drink.’ Mr Elliott was a trusted assistant who had keys to Mr Hockney’s house as much of the artist’s work was based from there. ‘He didn’t live with David but he was . there a lot and often stayed over,’ said the grandfather. ‘I think David . very much looked on Dominic as a son. ‘I’ve been told Dominic was at a party . the night before he was taken ill. I don’t know whether the party was . at David’s house or somewhere else.’ Mr Hockney is widely regarded as . Britain’s greatest living artist. His exhibition last year at  the Royal . Academy of Arts in London attracted more than 500,000 visitors. Art gallery boss and painter Alan . Stuttle, 74, who attended the Royal College of Art in London with Mr . Hockney, said the tragedy will have hit the artist ‘like a . sledgehammer’, adding: ‘He will learn to live with it. But he will never . get over it. He is such a caring man.’","Dominic Elliott rushed to hospital while staying at artist's home .

Hydrofluoric acid is highly corrosive and is often used in oil refining or to dissolve unnecessary rock. But the chemical can also be absorbed through the skin and into a person’s blood stream to cause systemic failure or a heart attack. Because of the ability of hydrofluoric acid to penetrate tissue, poisoning can occur through exposure of skin or eyes, or when inhaled or swallowed. Symptoms of exposure to hydrofluoric acid are not always immediately evident because burns may not initially be painful, but medical treatment is always needed.

Ski champion Bode Miller has filed new court documents in the custody battle with his ex-lover for their infant son. Miller has asked a judge to force the woman, model Sara McKenna, to move closer to him in California so he can spend time with the boy and also also moved to change the last name on his son's birth certificate from McKenna to Miller. Previously, McKenna tried to block Miller's attempts at custody, claiming in a court filing that the famed Olympic skier should not have custody of her son because he lives on a yacht and has substance abuse problems. It's a new twist in an ugly saga between Miller, McKenna and Miller's wife, volleyball player Morgan Beck, whom Miller married late last year. TMZ, which first reported news of the . legal documents, reported that McKenna also claimed Miller did not want . the child, and ask her to have an abortion. Miller, 35, launched his fight for . joint legal and physical custody of McKenna's child just days after Beck . suffered a miscarriage in January. Miller did not return a call from TMZ for comment. Last week, McKenna filed a police report against Beck, claiming online attacks and threatening messages on Twitter.

Officers were investigating reports of an illegal parade in Lurgan, Co Armagh, when the device went off near a primary school this afternoon. There were no reports of any injuries in the attack which was condemned as 'callous'. The bomb went off in a bin on Levin Road in Lurgan, Co Armagh, as police were investigating reports of an illegal parade . Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness described those responsible as anti-peace extremists who were living in a fantasy world. 'Bomb in Lurgan has to be condemned. Anti peace extremist living in a fantasy world. Attack futile. Won't change a thing. No going back,' said Mr McGuinness via Twitter. The no-warning explosion happened at about 3pm at the junction of North Circular Road and Levin Road. The finger of blame has been pointed towards dissident republicans who have been behind a number of shootings and bombings in recent weeks. John O'Dowd, Sinn Fein MLA in Lurgan, described the attack as stupid and said it was fortunate that police or locals were not hurt. 'Thankfully no-one was injured. They had a very, very lucky escape. The bin was completely destroyed and if anyone had been near it they would have been maimed or killed. 'Those who planted this device showed no regard for the local community, for the police or for the supporters who were watching the Easter parade. Lucky escape: A Sinn Fein politician said the attack was an attempt to kill PSNI officers . 'These so-called dissidents need to come out and explain exactly why they are doing this. The planting of this device along a busy road on one of the busiest days of the year was not only callous it was stupid,' Mr O'Dowd said. Last week, the dissidents - who have murdered two soldiers, two policemen and a prison guard in their campaign of violence - were blamed for abandoning a bomb close to the venue for the G8 summit in Co Fermanagh. Earlier this month, three police officers escaped injury when an explosive device detonated within metres of them as they patrolled a coastal path on the outskirts of Belfast. A mortar-type device was also discovered aimed towards a police station in north Belfast. In Londonderry, two men were arrested when police intercepted a van carrying four mortar bombs which were primed and ready to fire at Strand Road police station.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission confirmed it has launched a probe following the death of the man, 43, who was being held Washington police station in Northumbria, in the early hours of this morning. The man, who has not been named, had been arrested on a warrant on Thursday for failing to appear at court and was being held in police cells pending a rescheduled appearance, the IPCC said. Death: The unnamed man was being held at Washington Police Station in Tyne and Wear after failing to turn up to a court appearance . Northumbria Police said an ambulance was called to take the man to hospital on the recommendation of a force doctor shortly after 11.30pm last night, but that his condition deteriorated further prompting a second, emergency call. The prisoner was pronounced dead upon arrival at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Gateshead at around 1am this morning. An IPCC spokesman said: 'The available records indicate police officers requested the attendance of a police doctor in the evening on Friday 29 March and an ambulance was called at around 11:30 pm. 'The man was taken to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Gateshead where he was pronounced dead at around 1am today. 'His next of kin have been informed and a post-mortem will take place later this afternoon,' he said. 'IPCC family liaison managers will meet with the man's family at the earliest opportunity to explain our role and to update them on our investigation.' A Northumbria Police spokesman said officers arrested the man on warrant at his home in Houghton after he failed to appear at Gateshead Magistrates' Court on Tuesday. He had been due to appear in court for possessing an offensive weapon. The court date was rescheduled for today and the man was being held in custody at Washington police station in the meantime. The spokesman said: 'At 11.39pm, on Friday, March 29, an ambulance was called to the custody suite at Washington at the request of the doctor to transport the prisoner to hospital for medical assistance. However, the prisoner deteriorated and a further call as an emergency was made. Upon arrival at hospital, the man was pronounced dead.' The force said it is 'fully co-operating' with the IPCC's investigation. Probe: The man was pronounced dead upon arrival at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Gateshead at around 1am this morning . Chief Superintendent Kay Blyth, Sunderland Area Commander, said: 'We offer our sincere condolences to this man's family and friends at what is clearly a difficult time for them. 'Any death in police custody irrespective of the circumstances must be immediately referred to the IPCC and we are working with them to fully assist with their investigation. 'When a person is arrested, a full risk assessment is carried out and a suitable care plan is developed and implemented. We routinely revise these risk assessments during the time the prisoner remains in custody and amend the care plan accordingly. 'Deaths in police custody are fortunately relatively ucommon and there were no custody deaths in the Northumbria Police area last year. 'The police officers and police staff who work in the custody environment receive a higher standard of first aid training than regular officers. This enables them to provide an effective, immediate response in the event of a medical emergency until a doctor or paramedic is available,' said Chief Sup.

However, the party admitted last night that the headline claim was misleading: anyone taking home £1 million a year will actually see their annual tax bill fall by just over £42,000. The leaflets are dotted with numbered balls to ram home the ‘lottery’ point. A spokesman for Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said: ‘If you read the whole leaflet, it makes clear £100,000 is the average tax cut for those earning £1 million or more. ‘It would dilute the impact if you put all the caveats on the front.’ A spokesman for George Osborne said: ‘The 50p tax raised no money.

'Townies': Too many owners of countryside holiday homes don't contribute to the life of rural communities, Sir Andrew Motion has said . 'I would increase taxes on second homes to make it very expensive,' he told the Times. 'I think there's a question about whether second homes mean you have inert dormitory communities in the countryside through most of the week, very often lived in my people who scoot down in their cars, see their smart friends, don't join in the life of the community and don't feed into it,' he said. Rural life: The former poet laureate said taxes on second homes should be boosted to discourage city workers from snapping up rural properties . The latest census figures show that more than 165,000 people in the UK own a second home for weekends and holidays. Cornwall was revealed as the country's second-home capital - with . almost 23,000 people listing a Cornish address away from their main home . where they could be found for a month or more each year. St Ives MP Andrew George wants to see the council given authority to . block second home owners altogether to ensure more Cornish homes stay in . the hands of local owners. Campaign: The MP in St Ives, Cornwall, wants the council to have the power to block outsiders from buying property to use for weekends and holidays . Mr George has called for the introduction of a class of 'non-permanent occupancy' for homes, meaning people buying houses to use as a holiday property would have to declare it and seek permission. Permanent residents in the tourist hotspot say the area's popularity with city workers seeking second homes is pushing the price of housing out of the reach of local workers on comparatively lower wages. 'Local authorities need the power to curb the sheer volume of properties being transferred from family homes to holiday homes,' he said. Other parts of the UK with high concentrations of holiday homes include Gwynedd in North Wales, North Norfolk, and the Lake District.","Sir Andrew Motion has called for increased taxes to stop second-home owners 'gutting' rural communities .

Thousands of people have taken to the streets of the UK in protest at cuts to housing benefit for those with spare bedrooms. Around 3,000 people marched on George Square in Glasgow while up to 1,000 people assembled outside the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh, according to police estimates. The protesters insist that the new UK Government policy, dubbed the 'bedroom tax', will disproportionately affect disabled people and women, and could lead to evictions and deaths. Protestors claim the new tax will disproportionately affect disabled people and women, and could lead to evictions and deaths . Protesters took to the streets in Georges Square, Glasgow, to take part in the 'Axe the bedroom tax' demonstration . It will hit 660,000 households with an average loss of £14 per week, according to Crisis. The plans are aimed at those renting council housing or housing association properties and not those in private properties. The changes are an attempt to encourage those who have spare bedrooms to downsize. People took to the streets of London, Glasgow and Edinburgh to complain about the tax. Disability rights activist Susan Archibald, in Edinburgh, said: 'We have heard talk about ""strivers and skivers"". 'One person can be a striver one day and then get made redundant. Will they be a skiver the next day? That's how easy it happens.' John McArdle, from anti-disability discrimination campaign Black Triangle, said: 'Every day our campaign receives more messages from desperate people who are on the brink of suicide. 'This government is killing disabled people, and we must stand together and say enough is enough.' Protestors gather in Trafalgar Square to protest against the policy. The majority of the protests have been organised by Labour Left think tank with others involving the SNP, Greens and SWP together with various Trades Councils and Trade Unions . Angry protestors paraded through London, days before the new cut will come into effect . Some hid their faces behind masks, which have been used by internet hackers. Thousands protested in Trafalgar Square as charity Crisis warned that the cuts would be devastating . Protestors called Iain Duncan Smith a 'ratbag' Bill Scott, from disability campaign . group Inclusion Scotland, said two-thirds of UK properties affected . house a disabled person, rising to four-fifths in Scotland. 'The . purpose of an equality impact assessment is to find out and then change . your policy so it doesn't disproportionately impact on the vulnerable,' he said. 'Instead, the UK Government went ahead . and implemented that policy completely unchanged. It is a disgrace that . this government chose to attack disabled people.' Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith was branded a 'ratbag' by a heckler during his visit to Edinburgh last week. The . insult was adopted liberally at today's march, with protesters wearing . t-shirts and waving placards with the word 'ratbag' superimposed over Mr . Duncan Smith`s face. Kelly Parry, representing the National Union of Students, said: 'He is a ratbag. The cuts that are going to come in are going to disproportionately affect women. 'We need to fight back so that never again will the people of this country be robbed by Westminster.' In a statement of support for the marchers, SNP MSP Linda Fabiani said: 'The Scottish Government has brought in mitigation measures and has made a firm commitment to scrap the policy in an independent Scotland. 'There is no doubt that the bedroom tax is an abhorrent policy and the level of outrage surrounding what is being imposed is entirely justified.' The raft of Government welfare cuts that come into effect next week will heap misery on the UK's poorest families, a charity warned today. Queues at food banks are poised to get longer and homelessness is expected to increase, according to Crisis. Millions of homes will be hit by the combination of reforms that comes in from April, with low-paid workers, the unemployed and disabled people bearing the brunt of the cuts, it added. Hundreds of people took to Edinburgh's streets to protest against the introduction of the so-called Bedroom Tax . Council tax benefit, which covers some or all of the cost of the bill for struggling families, will be replaced by a new system that will be run by English local authorities but on 10 per cent less funding. Pensioners are protected under the changes but that is expected to mean a bigger burden on poor working age adults. Crisis said it also had 'serious concerns' about the replacement of disability living allowance (DLA) with a personal independence payment (PIP), claiming the the assessment process for the new benefit will exclude many disabled people who need support. Restrictions on the uprating of a number of welfare payments will also hit millions of households, it warned. Crisis chief executive Leslie Morphy, said: 'Our poorest households face a bleak April as they struggle to budget for all these cuts coming at once. People are already cutting back on the essentials of food and heating but there is only so much they can do. 'The result will be misery - cold rooms, longer queues at food banks, broken families, missed rent payments and yet more people facing homelessness - devastating for those directly affected, but bad for us all.'","Police estimated that about 4,000 people marched in Scotland .

Royal Marines armed with thermal-imaging equipment will patrol the water at today’s Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race in a tightening of security following last year’s disruption. Commandos will man up to ten rigid inflatable boats up and down the four-and-a-quarter-mile course. Organisers have introduced the ‘visible deterrent’ to prevent any copycat of protester Trenton Oldfield who stopped the race when he jumped into the Thames and was almost hit by one of the Oxford oars. Police will monitor Twitter for any signs of a planned disruption of the event. Royal Marines go through security preparation on the River Thames ahead of the University Boat Race . Executive director of the Boat Race David Searle said: ‘We are taking additional measures this year and have reviewed all of our actions last year in detail. ‘There will be an increased presence both on and off the water, including support from the Royal Marines, but as with any security plan I cannot disclose the exact details. ‘What I would say to anybody thinking of disrupting the race is that it’s unbelievably dangerous. You risk injuring yourself, the crews and the other people following the race. Nobody wants that. This is just a sporting event.’ However, organisers will not have to worry about Oldfield, 37, making an appearance. He will spend the day walking in the Cotswolds. The Australian was released from prison in December after serving seven weeks of a six-month sentence for causing a public nuisance. He has since been contacted by the . Metropolitan Police by letter and on Twitter to establish whether he was . planning any action this year, saying they were ‘keen to facilitate any . peaceful protest’. In a statement, the police stressed they were not offering to organise a protest but to afford him the opportunity to exercise his ‘lawful rights without causing disruption or danger to themselves or others’. Police are being vigilant in case of any attempts to copycat the prtest by Trenton Oldfield which halted last year's race . However, Oldfield told The Spectator he would ‘probably have a ramble across the Cotswolds instead’. Oxford have emerged as clear favourites to win the race after more than 70 per cent of bets were placed on the Dark Blues, according to bookmaker William Hill. Spokesman Joe Crilly said: ‘Oxford are certainly the best backed crew as of yet, although that was very much the case at this stage of proceedings last year. ‘Last year, however, we took nearly £40,000 on the day of the race and Cambridge became best backed by the time the race started. Maybe history will repeat itself this time around.’ There have been calls for supporters to boycott the Cambridge team over claims that it plans to build a new boat house which will threaten wildlife. The 159th University Boat Race will take place today with Oxford being tipped as favourites to win . Mark Avery, the former head of conservation at the RSPB and Cambridge student, told the Daily Telegraph that the building project is in danger of wiping out otters and bitterns on the Great Ouse river. ‘I hope that the Cambridge boat sinks in Sunday's University Boat Race,’ he said. ‘Why? Because the Cambridge University Boat Club is planning to build a new boathouse (although it is far more than just a boathouse) on one of the best sites for otters in Cambridgeshire, and its impact on local wildlife will be severe.’ But Project Ely, the group working to provide the new facility, have stressed the boat house would be built sensitively to protect its natural surroundings, the paper reported.","Commandos will be armed with thermal-imaging equipment .

When it comes to wooing women, the Doctor might do well to take a leaf out of Matt Smith's book. While the lovestruck Time Lord struggles to develop a deeper relationship with his new travelling companion Clara Oswin Oswald in the new series that starts this week after locking lips with her in the Christmas Special, Matt won over the actress who plays her with a simple blend of kindness and enthusiasm. Or, as the actress who plays Clara, Jenna-Louise Coleman, puts it, 'He totally blew me away. I'd worked on all these carefully prepared ideas and accents for my audition, but everything just went out of the window when Matt started to talk and move around in the rehearsal room. He was like a hurricane, full of fantastic ideas and spontaneity. He started playing different characters I could bounce off and made me feel as if he were auditioning himself, he got so into it. 'I remember thinking how fantastic it would be if I actually got the part, how great it would be working with Matt. And that's exactly what's happened. Matt's the perfect leading man and sets such a lovely tone on set, making the atmosphere wonderful. There's really not much more you could ask for in your co-star.' In typical Doctor Who fashion, Jenna's introduction to the series has been anything but straightforward. She made her debut in an episode last September, playing a character called Oswin Oswald who was trapped inside a Dalek. Then she reappeared in last year's Christmas special as Clara Oswald, a Victorian barmaid who met an unfortunate end. Her 'third entrance', as she calls it, sees her playing Clara in the present day, now a governess in a London suburb to two children who've lost their mother. 'She meets the Doctor when he turns up on her doorstep dressed as a monk, so that's her first impression and I had to treat it as a completely clean slate. But this is the Clara, or at least  the essence of her, that you'll see from now on,' says Jenna, 'for the rest of the current series and into the next one too. And after that? Who knows...' Matt Smith and Jenna-Louise Colema look set to hike up the on-screen chemistry in the new series of Dr Who . The big question, of course, is how far their fledgling romance that began with that Christmas kiss will go. Jenna's not about to spoil it for the fans (although she does refer to the Tardis as 'a kissing booth' in this week's episode), but reveals Matt Smith was keen to stoke up some chemistry between them. Once she'd landed the part, he suggested she watch some classic Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy movies such as Woman Of The Year and Without Love that made much of the sexual frisson between the two actors. 'He thought they'd be useful in understanding the rhythm and pace of a relationship between a male and female lead, and they were. He also suggested I watch some Indiana Jones films - which I'd never seen before - because the main character's always accompanied by various women on his adventures.' Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy famously had an off-screen affair, but that won't be happening with Jenna and Matt. The lantern-jawed actor may have recently revealed he's single again after his on/off romance with model Daisy Lowe ended and he hasn't been slow in paying Jenna compliments, describing her as 'hot' and 'stunning-looking on screen'. Doctor Who with Jenna-Louise Coleman as Clara and Matt Smith as The Doctor in the Christmas special . But Jenna's been in a relationship with Game Of Thrones star Richard Madden for the past couple of years, and when the cameras aren't rolling she and Matt seem more like conspiratorial friends than anything else, a couple of mates enjoying being involved in one of TV's most popular shows. They take particular delight in welcoming guest stars to Roath Lock, the studios in Cardiff where the show is filmed. Matt's introduced Jenna to a game called The Uncomfortable Touch, where he greets a guest on their first day on set with what might be deemed an over-familiar display of affection - a hand on the arm, shoulder, perhaps even bottom, just to gauge their reaction. This kept Matt and Karen Gillan, the Doctor's former assistant Amy Pond, amused for hours. Some people though, reveals Jenna, are exempt. 'There were no liberties taken with Dame Diana Rigg when she turned up for an episode later in the series, Matt and I just watched her from afar, fascinated by the dynamic between her and her daughter Rachael Stirling, who also plays her daughter on the show.' Jenna-Louise says filming Dr Who is always enjoyable, 'even when it's soggy' Rubbing shoulders with dames was the last thing on her mind when Blackpool-born Jenna, now 26, began her career as Emmerdale's Jasmine Thomas, a part she landed at the age of 19 and continued in for almost five years. After a stint on BBC1 drama Waterloo Road, the role of cheeky Cockney maid Annie Desmond in Julian Fellowes' Titanic brought her to a wider audience. But it's Doctor Who, with  its loyal fans ('Although I can honestly say I haven't received a single love letter or marriage proposal since I joined,' says Jenna) and the almost iconic status his assistants assume, that will cement her in the nation's consciousness. After a pretty gruelling schedule she's now putting the finishing touches to the current series before taking a well-earned rest this summer while Matt Smith travels to Detroit to film his role in the Ryan Gosling movie How To Catch A Monster. Then it'll be back to work for the star-studded 50th anniversary special, which is rumoured to have lots of old doctors on board and due to be shown in November. 'It's been tough at times,' admits Jenna. 'The third episode in this current run, called Cold War, is set on board a Russian submarine and marks the return of the classic Doctor Who monsters the Ice Warriors. Before every take in that episode they'd come and spray us with water, so we were soaking wet for two weeks. 'But Doctor Who is always hugely enjoyable, even when it's soggy. There's a scene in tonight's first episode where the doctor comes revving out of the Tardis on a motorcycle and he and Clara travel across London. I'm sitting there with my hands around Matt's middle, riding across Westminster Bridge on a motorbike with the Houses Of Parliament in the background and thinking, ""This is fun, this is really good fun.""' Jenna-Louise Coleman with Jeff Hordley in Emmerdale in 2006 . The most difficult thing about the job, she says, is trying to keep the vow of secrecy that's a prerequisite for anyone involved with the show - something Jenna got an early taste of when she first went for the part and was forced to throw friends and family off the scent by telling them she was auditioning for a TV comedy in Cardiff. 'I've had to learn to say a lot - because there's so much interest in Doctor Who - without giving anything away. It's the nature of the programme. It's based on surprises and reveals, so the last thing you want to do is give away anything that might spoil it for the viewers. 'All I can say is that the Doctor sees Clara as a work in progress and a subject of both endless fascination - and frustration too,' she says. 'There's nothing the Doctor hates more than an unsolved mystery and Clara Oswald is exactly that. He won't stop until he finds out the truth about her. And that could take a while.'

More than 2,000 people displaced by Superstorm Sandy are still living in hotels five months after the devastating natural disaster destroyed their New York City homes. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is paying on average $252 a night to house families and individuals from across the hurricane hit area. According to the New York Times, social service groups are hoping to get all those affected into a permanent home by the end of April but admit it may not be possible. Homeless: More than 2,000 victims of Superstorm Sandy are still living in hotels across New York City . Some experts say such accommodation will put pressure on individuals - leaving them in cramped conditions with no feeling of permanency. Others say it is just too expensive as a long-term solution. 'The problem with hotels is that it’s not a normal life — you can’t cook a meal,' said Martha J. Kegel, executive director of Unity of Greater New Orleans, a coalition that helped relocate residents after Hurricane Katrina, told the Times. 'You can’t even store much food. There’s going to be domestic violence because there’s not enough room. It’s not a good situation for people to be long-term.' Rosanne Haggerty, president of Community Solutions, a homelessness charity said: 'Why are we spending money on hotels instead of helping families pay the rent?' Devastation: Those still in hotels can't afford current housing available in New York City. Their previous homes were destroyed in the storm . 'For a fraction of the cost, families could be in a stable situation and getting a running start in putting their lives together.' Wanda Wilson, a mother-of-two made homeless after Sandy told the paper she hoped for a more permanent solution. 'The whole situation is really messed up. It’s a waste of money,' she said. Many of those affected by Sandy are too poor to afford available housing and have nowhere to return to because of the devastating impact of the storm. 43 per cent of those who registered for FEMA funding made less than $30,000 per year per household. The lack of available housing made hotels the only choice according to city officials. 'The hotels provided flexibility and availability that you can’t get anywhere else,' the city’s commissioner of homeless services Seth Diamond said. Recovery: Many of those affected by the storm were New York's poorest earning less than $30,000 per household . Support: Thousands needed help after the storm. People are pictured here waiting in line at a distribution site in Coney Island . It is hoped newly available public housing will plug the gap but in some instances families will also be given vouchers to subsidize 70 per cent of their rent. If the April 30 target is missed many of the families could end up back in homeless shelters, according to the Times. 'Shelter is one of many possibilities,' said Barbara Brancaccio, a spokeswoman for the city’s Department of Homeless Services. The ongoing difficulties in dealing with the 7,000 residents who went to evacuation centers following Hurricane Sandy on October 29, has prompted many to call for wholesale reform of the city's emergency disaster planning. 'The city may have been overly optimistic,' said Councilman Brad Lander. 'You need to have emergency rental vouchers ready to be deployed.' After Hurricane Katrina many of those made homeless were put in hotels for years. And there are many people affected by Sandy who may never get help. According to the Times, around two per cent of those in need are illegal immigrants who don't want to reveal their status to officials. On Friday, the Government announced $1.4billion in aid to New York transit agencies to help rebuild systems after Sandy.","Officials say they have no choice but to keep families in hotels across New York City .

Scientists have discovered a prehistoric species of armoured predatory fish with 'legs' in a 370million year old fossil. Archaeologists uncovered the ancient creature while studying sandstone deposits in a section of road in north central Pennsylvania. It is believed to be from the late Devonian period, at a time . long before dinosaurs walked the Earth – but, geologically speaking, not . long before the very first species began to walk on land. Scientists have discovered a prehistoric species of armoured predatory fish with 'legs' in a 370million year old fossil . The creature is believed to be from the late Devonian period, at a time long before dinosaurs walked the Earth . Fossils of armored fishes like this one, a phyllolepid placoderm, are known for the distinctive ornamentation of 'leg-like' ridges on their exterior plates. Using a method more familiar to crime scene investigators, Dr . Ted Daeschler, of Drexel University, managed to create a copy of the . fossil with a rubber cast made by pouring latex into its natural . impression in the rock. This is a dorsal view of the dermal armor of the newly identified fossil fish species, Phyllolepis thomsoni . Placodermi is an extinct class of armoured prehistoric fish, known from fossils, which lived from the late Silurian to the end of the Devonian Period. Their head and thorax were covered by articulated armoured plates and the rest of the body was scaled or naked, depending on the species. Placoderms were among the first jawed fish; their jaws likely evolved from the first of their gill arches. A 380-million-year-old fossil of one species represents the oldest known example of live birth . This placoderm, named . Phyllolepis thomsoni, is one of two new Devonian fish species presented by Daeschler in the Bicentennial issue of the Proceedings of the Academy . of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. The other new species is a lobe-finned fish discovered in northern Canada. Once the latex hardened, Dr Daeschler peeled it out and dusted its surface with a fine powder to better show the edges of the bony plates and the shapes of fine ridges on the fish's bony armor – a lot like dusting for fingerprints to show minute ridges left on a surface. Dr Daeschler and colleagues were then better able to prepare a detailed scientific description of the new species . Dr Daeschler has dug for Devonian species in Pennsylvania since 1993, and in northern Canada since 1999. His work helps to explain how the first vertebrate species with limbs evolved. The Phyllolepis thomsoni,species has been named in honor of Dr. Keith S. Thomson, a colleague of Dr Daeschler.","Ancient creature discovered while studying sandstone in a section of road .

Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg's new book, Lean In - offering advice for how women can get ahead in the workplace - has received a mixed range of reviews from critics but none as harsh as a tweet sent to one particular negative reviewer. Former head of public relations at Facebook Brandee Barker, who is working on promoting Sandberg’s book, sent the abusive tweet on Wednesday after becoming infuriated at the review that appeared in Dissent magazine written by another ex-Facebooker, Katherine Losse. Losse worked as a speechwriter for CEO Mark Zuckerberg and last year published a memoir of her time at the company. War of words: Katherine Losse, left, received the angry tweet from Brandee Barker over her review of the Sheryl Sandberg's 'feminist manifesto' Lean In . Lean in: Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, said that men still dominate the workforce and things need to change . From her review of Sandberg’s new book, Losse clearly isn’t a fan of the Facebook COO’s musings about the path forward for working women. ‘By arguing that women should express their feminism by remaining in the workplace at all costs, Sandberg encourages women to maintain a commitment to the workplace without encouraging the workplace to maintain a commitment to them,’ writes Losse. She also compares the Lean In ‘movement’ that Sandberg is seeking to establish with Facebook’s tendency to clone or acquire potential threats. ‘By launching a feminist platform, Sandberg is able to contain the broader threat that a feminist critique poses to Facebook’s business, simultaneously generating more power for herself and her organization - Silicon Valley 'revolution' at its finest. This manoeuvre, as I learned in my years at Facebook, is how the game is played, and both Sandberg and Zuckerberg play it well.’ Tweet of shame: Katherine Losse sent a photograph of the rude message she received from Sandberg's publicist Brandee Barker . Losse also sent this tweet about the reaction she received from Barker . Author: Sheryl Sandberg's new book Lean In will be out on bookstore shelves on March 11 . The review is unlikely to been well . received by either Sandberg or Zuckerberg and Barker was quick to seek . some retaliation: ‘there’s a special place in hell for you,’ she . tweeted. Since the . controversial book launched earlier this month, Sandberg, 43, has taken . time out from her busy job at Facebook to carry out a media tour to . promote it. On the eve of its release, she spoke with CBS’ ’60 . Minutes,’ about the challenges . that modern women face, and said that they are stalled in their rise to . power. Herself a Harvard graduate with a very impressive resume, she currently works as Facebook’s number two in command – right next to its founder, Mark Zuckerberg. But what’s been getting the most attention is her crusade to bring awareness to workplace inequality, and the strains put upon working women who also want to have families. Sandberg has suggested that there are so few women running companies because they self-impose limits. The title of her book is derived from a 2010 TED talk where she said that women hurt themselves by leaning back. ‘They say, I’m busy or I want to have a child one day, I couldn’t possibly take on any more. 'Or I’m still learning my current job. I’ve never heard a man say that to me,’ Sandberg said. Sandberg herself was admittedly reluctant to accept her high school yearbook’s award after she was voted ‘Most Likely to Succeed.’ ‘I was embarrassed,’ the mother of two said. ‘My entire life I have been told…or I have felt that I should hold back on being too successful, too smart, too – you know – lots of things.’ But the COO made it clear that she is not blaming professional women for the lack of female executives in the workforce. A woman on the move: Sandberg, 43, launched her book earlier this month and was featured on a recent cover of Time magazine . ‘There’s an awful lot we don’t . control. I’m saying that there’s an awful lot we can control and we can . do for ourselves to sit at more tables, raise more hands.’ She . also said that while marriage is the largest personal decision a person . can make in their lives, choosing a spouse has extreme implications in . the workplace too. ‘Partner with the right person because you cannot . have a full career and a full life at home with the children if you are . also doing all the housework and childcare.’ Sandberg . has most recently been in New York City to promote her book. In a . whirlwind of publicity, she has also been featured in Vanity Fair and . appears on the March 18 cover of Time magazine. Controversy: Sandberg has not helped herself with divisive speeches in which she has said: 'The moment a woman starts thinking about having a child, she doesn't raise her hand anymore' Speaking out: Facebook chief operating officer Cheryl Sandberg, who has a personal fortune of $500million, says that there were things beyond the control of women that were holding them back . The . Facebook guru, who was ranked by Forbes as the tenth most powerful . woman in the U.S., has been criticized for being out-of-touch with the . modern working woman because of her extreme wealth. According . to Forbes, Sandberg made nearly $31million in 2011, including her base . salary for Facebook and around $30million in stock options. Sandberg . told O’Donnell in the interview: 'I am not saying everyone has the . resources or opportunities I have. I am not saying every husband is . going to wake up tomorrow, read a book and do his share. I'm saying that . women need to own the power that they have, negotiate for raises.'

She regularly tops best dressed lists for her urban chic style and savvy fashion statements but Rihanna didn't quite make 'the cut' on the latest survey. The 25-year-old singer's ‘Skrillex’ hairstyle has been voted the worst hair trend of the 21st Century. The Barbadian singer, whose tresses have been compared to those of DJ Skrillex, scored 20 per cent of the vote, beating the likes of David Beckham’s cornrows and Kelly Osbourne’s Mohawk. The Skrillex: Rihanna's shaved hairstyle, which has been dubbed 'The Skrillex' after the DJ, has been voted the worst hairstyle of the century . The ‘Skrillex’ trend consists of shaving one side of the head with the rest remaining long and has been made famous by celebs such as Rihanna and Avril Lavigne. David Beckham’s cornrows narrowly missed out on being voted the worst locks, receiving 19 per cent of the vote. Hair crimes: David Beckham's cornrows (circa 2003) and Kelly Osbourne's mohawk from 2001 were also among the top 10 worst hairstyles since 2000 . In third place was Hollywood A-lister Scarlett Johansson and her infamous mullet followed by Kelly Osbourne’s Mohawk, which scored 16 per cent and 14 per cent respectively. In fifth place was Cristiano Ronaldo’s ‘greasy’ hairstyle with 12 per cent, beating singing superstar Christina Aguilera and her dreadlocks into sixth place. Justin Timberlake’s blonde curls trounced comedian Russell Brand’s unique hairstyle to be voted as the seventh worst hair trend with six per cent of the vote. Top contenders: Scarlett Johansson and her infamous 2003 mullet as well as Cristiano Ronaldo's 'greasy' hairstyle also gave Rihanna a run for her money . The final two places were taken up by music mogul Simon Cowell’s flattop middle parting and eccentric singer Nicki Minaj’s colourful hairstyles. One respondent commented: 'What is with the fascination with the ""Skrillex"" haircut? All these celebrities think they’re so cool, but you can just see kids following this stupid trend.  How are they going to get jobs with a half shaven head?' Another said: 'David Beckham has had some brilliant hairstyles but those cornrows were a shocker. It looks like Victoria dared him to do it.

Francesca Davies from Fabriah.com, who carried out the study, said: 'I am not at all surprised the ""Skrillex"" look claimed the prize as the worst hair trend of the 21st Century. 'What is surprising however, is the number of people still copying the style. I would never have imagined the haircut becoming so popular.

To say I was in awe of Les Dawson the day I met him would be an understatement; I was a still-wet-behind-the-ears television scriptwriter (at the time, the only credit I had to my name was contributing to the 'news items' that topped and tailed The Two Ronnies), whereas Les was one of the biggest comedy stars in the country. What would I say to him? Would I be able to say anything, or would the words stick in my mouth? I needn't have worried. He . had no airs and graces, no edge, nothing of the 'Big I Am' about him; . he was exactly the man viewers saw on their TV screens, and from the . moment we shook hands it was like being with someone I'd known all my . life. It remained that way for the six years I spent providing him with . many of the gags he used on his shows, the rough pebbles that became . polished gemstones once he'd added his perfect inflection and delivery . to them. Les Dawson as Ada and Roy Barraclough as Cissie in Cissy & Ada . We'd been brought together by chance. The Two Ronnies producer Peter Whitmore had been handed the task of producing what would be Les's first solo series since joining the BBC from ITV the year previously. In its wisdom the BBC, rather than relying on tried-and-trusted scriptwriters, had decided to try out four new writers to provide the scripts for what was to be The Dawson Watch. They were Andy Hamilton, Tom Magee-Engelfield, Colin Bostock-Smith and myself. I was treated to an example of Les's off-the-cuff wit when it became apparent that Tom and Colin weren't coming up with the sort of material that suited Les. At a script conference, Peter Whitmore said to Les, 'Oh by the way, I've had to let Magee-Engelfield and Bostock-Smith go.' Quick as a flash, Les replied, 'Well, that's got rid of four of them.' Eric Potts and Steve Nallon in the new play . By the time it had become The Les Dawson Show, I was the sole writer apart from Les himself. I wrote the sketches and Les wrote the stand-up, and we each chipped in with ideas for both. Of course, some of the best-loved moments were the Cissie & Ada sketches, and the intriguing history behind them formed the starting point for our new play. The gossiping old housewives came about through improvisation when Les was with Yorkshire TV doing Sez Les years earlier. He was a big fan of music-hall legend Norman Evans, famous for dressing up as an 'Ada' type woman for his 'Over the Garden Wall' act, and between takes Les and his Sez Les co-star Roy Barraclough would make up bits with each other as Norman Evans-type women. The sketch was resurrected on the BBC at my suggestion because I knew, perhaps more than Les did, just how popular it would be. The way it worked is that I would write the sketch and while we were rehearsing it Les would throw in the odd line (between you and me, it was usually one he'd used in the past and he knew would get a laugh) and Roy would do likewise. I'd sometimes add something myself, or suggest an alteration if it wasn't quite working. When Chris Mellor, creative producer at The Broadway theatre in Barking, noticed the discrepancies between my original scripts and the televised footage while researching Les's career, he decided to try and track the artistic journey of all the sketches - including the heated discussions that took place - and the play reveals what he discovered. It not only captures the nostalgia of the pieces, but the backstage antics that went on while they were being created. Les was 'exactly the man viewers saw on their TV screens', known for his ad-libbing and generous spirit . So, what was working with such a comedy legend really like? On the first run-through of a sketch, Les would always be word perfect. Initially I thought it was because he'd taken great pains to learn the script, but the truth was he had an almost photographic memory and only had to read a script once to retain about 90 per cent of it. And the ten per cent he didn't retain he would fill in with his own ad-libs - which were often funnier than the words he'd forgotten. Although Les knew his lines, this wasn't to say rehearsals were a pleasurable experience for me. Traumatic would be a better description. The way it went was that Les and his co-stars would act out a sketch. Les's performance would be nigh-on perfect. Minutes later, after a few suggestions from the producer, the cast would do the sketch again. This time Les would perform his part in an entirely different way and usually not nearly so well. Les Dawson as Ada and Roy Barraclough as Cissie on the Les Dawson Show . By the time the actors had rehearsed the sketch for a fourth or fifth time Les's performance had diminished to truly abysmal. The truth, it eventually dawned on me, was that Les quickly became bored and was trying to relieve the tedium of doing it again and again! In his mind he'd already done it the way he meant to and had no intention of doing it the same way again until it really mattered - the performance to the studio audience on recording night. I have one abiding memory of Les that demonstrates the man's generosity of spirit. It was a recording night and, with the audience settled in their seats for the 7.30pm start, Les was nowhere to be seen. Search parties were sent out to all four corners of TV Centre. The star of the show was eventually run to ground in the BBC canteen telling jokes to two cleaning ladies. The PA who found him said, 'Les, for God's sake, there's an audience of 300 waiting for the show to start.' Les, without showing the slightest concern, said, 'Make that 302,' turned to the cleaning ladies and said, 'Follow me, girls.' And they did, to seats on the front row.

Bill Oddie, at front, performing in the Cambridge Circus New Revue At The Lyric Theatre with John Cleese and Tim Brooke Taylor . My father is responsible for my entire showbusiness career. If he hadn't pushed me to go to King Edward's School in Birmingham, which was, and still is, a very good school, and then on to Cambridge I would never have discovered a talent for comedy. We lived in Hagley, Birmingham; it was just me and Dad as my parents had split up when I was small. At school, I was drawn to acting and singing, and put together the school revue in 1959, in which I performed my own songs and sketches. I loved hearing an audience laugh - it was and still is a great feeling. When I went away to Cambridge in 1960 after winning a scholarship to Pembroke College, I met Tim Brooke-Taylor (later to become a writing partner in The Goodies) who was a year older than me, and we rapidly became friends. John Cleese was two years older than me but started at Downing College at the same time. As they were both in the Footlights, I plucked up the courage to join in my second year. We all got on well and spent hours at the Footlights Club, rehearsing and coming up with ideas. As I started my third year, I wasn't thinking about what my career might be. But during that autumn term I wrote a song about the singer Adam Faith for the Footlights termly show. It contained some nice word play, and luckily for me someone from the BBC saw it being performed. I then got a message to call a producer from That Was The Week That Was, the BBC's flagship satirical comedy show. Suddenly I was being offered £30, and one of my songs was going to be on national TV! It was a penny-dropping moment. I thought, ‘Aha, there might be a career here.' I'd done some holiday work as a scaffolder, but now earning money as an entertainer became a possibility. I remember telling my dad that Christmas, and he was a bit perplexed but pleased; he had wanted me to be a teacher. I was soon bringing in more money doing cabaret performances with my Footlights colleagues in London and Cambridge and my new career as an entertainer started to gather pace. Bill Oddie on Springwatch, left, and with his granddaughter Ellie at a London film premiere . Then, to all of our surprise, our revue show A Clump Of Plinths, which was later renamed Cambridge Circus, made it to London and we spent the next few months performing at the Lyric Theatre to rave reviews. The cast was me, John Cleese, Tim Brooke-Taylor, Graham Chapman, Jonathan Lynn, David Hatch, Jo Kendall and Chris Stuart-Clark. We then took it to New Zealand and later New York. After that I got regular writing work for radio shows before Graeme Garden, Tim and I put together The Goodies, which ran for nearly 12 years. I'd never have thought I would have made it in showbusiness but luck and serendipity really played their part in what has turned out to be a marvellous career.

Scotland Yard detectives have asked Moscow to provide DNA samples of a feared gangland hitman believed to be behind the violent attempt on a Russian banker's life in London last year. German Gorbuntsov, 45, was shot six times by a lone assassin as he entered his flat on Byng Street in the capital's Docklands on March 20. Despite initially falling into a coma he miraculously survived, but police are yet to discover who carried out the near-fatal shooting, which Gorbuntsov claims was ordered by shady Russian kingpins linked to Vladimir Putin. Their prime suspect has been named as alleged Moldovan gun-for-hire Vitalie Proca, who is thought to be hiding out in Moscow. Survived: German Gorbuntsov, 45, was shot six times by a lone assassin as he entered his flat on Byng Street in the capital's Docklands on March 20 . Proca, whose mother-in-law has gone on Romanian television to protest his innocence, is also wanted by Romanian police who are seeking his extradition suspected of a separate shooting in Bucharest. Police found a gun, a hoodie and a bag near the spot where Gorbuntsov was gunned down and say they managed to recover DNA that did not find a match when run through Scotland Yard's criminal database. They are now hoping their Russian counterparts can shed light on their investigation that has so far drawn a blank. Detective Chief Inspector Russell Taylor, who is leading the Gorbuntsov investigation, told The Independent: 'I’m hopeful that they [the Russians] will accede to our request but it’s very early days. I don’t know what their views are going to be.' Moldovan gun-for-hire? Mr Gorbuntsov's lawyer has said prime suspect Vitalie Proca resembles the man captured on CCTV at Canary Wharf underground station, left, and walking on nearby Manilla Street, right, on the day of the shooting . Is this the shooter? Proca, whose mother-in-law has gone on Romanian television to protest his innocence, is also wanted by Romanian police who are seeking his extradition suspected of a separate shooting in Bucharest . The request comes at a sensitive time in the relationship between British and Russian authorities amid mounting speculation over the recent death of the oligarch Boris Berezovsky . and the upcoming inquest into the death of Alexander Litvinenko, the . former Russian secret service officer poisoned in London in 2006. Gorbuntsov is currently holed up in a secret location in London as he continues his convalescence. He told the Independent from his hospital bed last June that he believed the hit was orchestrated by people with connections to the Kremlin. Big claims: Gorbuntsov says he believes the hit was orchestrated by people with connections to the Kremlin. He is currently holed up in a secret location in London as he continues his convalescence . He said he suspected the . investigation was being held up because the men he has named claim to be . friends of the Russian President, Vladimir Putin. Speaking via a Skype internet . connection set up from his lawyers' Moscow office, he told the paper: 'The . evidence I have is enough to put them behind bars. 'Of course . they have good connections, but I'd like to believe there is justice in . Russia.' The banker had fled to London to hide from his former business partners and said nobody knew where he was living. But he noticed he was being followed in the days before the shooting. He did not see the man who fired at him. Doctors have told Mr Gorbuntsov he will need to remain in hospital for up to three months, although his condition is stable. The . banker and his lawyers believe he was attacked because he was preparing . to give evidence to Russian prosecutors about a botched assassination . attempt on his former business partner, Alexander Antonov. Mr Antonov, father of Vladimir Antonov, the former owner of Portsmouth Football Club, was shot in Moscow in 2009 but survived. In April last year, he told the Mail he had just stepped out of a taxi and . was punching in the entry code to his apartment block when his would-be . assassin emerged from the shadows and opened fire. He said: ‘It had been an ordinary day and it was around 8pm when I got back home from my office in the City. 'I . tapped in the code and when I got to the third digit I suddenly felt a . terrible sharp pain in my stomach, and then another, and another.'

Critical: German Gorbuntsov was taken to hospital by ambulance after the attack . Mr Gorbuntsov’s lawyer has said Mr Proca resembles the man captured . on CCTV cameras and suspected of involvement in the shooting. The case bears similarities with the poisoning of Russian intelligence agent Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006. No one has been convicted of Mr Litvinenko's murder, which led to a cooling of relations between Britain and Moscow.","German Gorbuntsov, 45, was shot six times by a lone assassin on March 20 .

When Silvena Rowe first arrived in Britain from Bulgaria as a teenager she knew just one word of English - 'hungry'. A strapping six-footer who'd been obsessed with food from her earliest days ('I was a very greedy child'), she was determined to eat well in the UK. Now she has several award-winning cookery books to her name, is about to star in a new BBC food show and has plans for her own restaurant chain; all of which has forced her to reluctantly quit her job as head chef at Quince, the smart restaurant adjoining The May Fair Hotel in London. The night before we meet she had boy band One Direction in her kitchen after they booked a private dinner there to celebrate Louis's birthday. 'They were tremendously respectful and polite,' she says. 'They were so cute and fresh. I do hear they like an older woman!' Silvena Rowe with Aldo Zilli on Country Show Cook-Off . And that's Silvena all over - a fascinating mix of feline-eyed sensuality mixed with tough-as-old-boots attitude. When she was once asked how she managed to keep her skin looking so fresh despite long hours in the kitchen she replied, 'I drink young men's blood!' And the word ambitious doesn't come close to describing her. 'You have to have b***s to run a kitchen, every day is hard,' she says. 'I'm breaking glass ceilings but I want to do so much more. You see Jamie Oliver and Gordon Ramsay? They're in a different realm to any other chef and I want to be there. I want to be the one providing that excitement.' She's aiming high, but if any female chef can take on the big boys the smart money's on Silvena. The daughter of a Turkish-born journalist and a housewife, Silvena left Communist Bulgaria at 16 after falling in love with an English wine dealer, Malcolm Rowe, because 'he did not grab me in the way other boys grabbed me'. They married and while Silvena stayed at home bringing up their first son she taught herself to cook by eating out at nice restaurants with her husband and reading Delia Smith's books. Silvena Rowe on This Morning . After friends started entering her for competitions she landed a job as chef in the cafe at London's trendy book shop Books for Cooks, and before long was cooking for private clients including Princess Michael of Kent. 'She was a tough lady but she had a very good palate,' recalls Silvena. It wasn't long before TV executives started taking notice of this rather fascinating lady, and she's been a favourite on BBC1's Saturday Kitchen for six years now. 'When I first started on that show people would write comments like, “Who's that slut flirting with James Martin?” But now they know me and come to my restaurant.' She's also a regular on This Morning, where Eamonn Holmes loves to have a good old flirt with her too - which doesn't always go down well with his wife and fellow presenter Ruth Langsford. 'Ruth and I are friends supposedly but I think she gets very angry,' admits Silvena. 'She'll make remarks like, “He's my husband,” and I'll say, “Thank you for reminding me.” But Eamonn likes it; he plays up to it and makes it happen. I do like Eamonn - he's very warm. But he's not so hot that Ruth has to worry.' So is there anyone she's worked alongside who she didn't flirt with? 'Antony Worrall Thompson,' she says. 'He's like a ginger garden gnome.' Write caption here . Silvena and her husband have been married for 27 years (Silvena won't actually give her age, but she's somewhere in her mid-40s), and it's probably a good job he refuses to watch her on TV. 'He thinks I'm too much,' she laughs. 'Even when I'm just sitting down I'm too much for him. He gets very nervous about watching me on TV but he wouldn't mind me flirting - he knows I'm a very passionate person and that I love him more now than when we first met.' Silvena at the 2012 World Food Awards in London last November . She also adores her two boys, who are now 24 and 18. Only once during our two-hour conversation does Silvena pause for more than a second. It's when I ask her about being a working mother in what is a notoriously difficult profession for women. 'Yes, I feel guilty,' she says quietly. 'Even now I do. But I'm lucky I had my children when I was young.' She doesn't like to be called a feminist but admits she had this lovely idea of having an all-female kitchen when she opened Quince. 'But I couldn't find strong enough women to work in my kitchen,' she says. 'I tried, I really tried. But it was impossible because most of them were weak and pathetic [she spits out the words]. They're too worried about their love affairs and their insecurities. They were physically weak too - the majority of women are their own worst enemies.' Her new programme, BBC2's Country Show Cook Off, pits top chefs against the public as they vie to win prizes at local cooking competitions. When we meet she's just returned from a jaunt to the Yorkshire Dales where she was paired with Aldo Zilli to cook traditional cakes. She won't say which of them won; but she has a glint in her eye. 'We go to some of the most beautiful parts of Britain in a 1950s camper van with a little kitchen at the back. I crashed the van a couple of times but it was hilarious. The people we met were charming but they looked at me like I was some furry blonde exotic creature and I'm not sure they could understand my accent. Aldo's great fun but we were very competitive. All chefs are competitive.' After seeing her steal the show from Aldo, the BBC are already talking to her about a new project. 'I can't say anything but it will be mind-blowing,' she squeals. And if that's not enough, she's in talks to judge a new restaurant show in America. Somehow she has to fit in what she hopes will be a chain across the United Arab Emirates after being approached by investors. Silvena is living her dream and she really couldn't be happier. 'I feel very lucky to be where I am,' she says. 'I have this theory; people talk about how we all need to embrace life, how we need to love life. I also think it's important that life loves you back. And I really feel that my life loves me back. It's fantastic!' Country Show Cook Off, Monday, 1.05pm, Tuesday-Friday, 2.45pm, BBC2 .","Moved to Britain from Bulgaria as a teenager .

Divorcing: 'Pregnant Man' Thomas Beatie, right, is hoping to divorce his wife Nancy, left, but an Arizona judge is not convinced their marriage was legal in the first place . Gerlach said he had no jurisdiction . to approve a divorce because there's insufficient evidence that Beatie . was a man when he married Nancy Beatie in Hawaii. He said the Beaties . never provided records to fully explain what Thomas Beatie actually had . done and not done to become a man. 'The decision here is not based on . the conclusion that this case involves a same-sex marriage merely . because one of the parties is a transsexual male, but instead, the . decision is compelled by the fact that the parties failed to prove that . (Thomas Beatie) was a transsexual male when they were issued their . marriage license,' he wrote in Friday's ruling. A spokesman for Beatie, Ryan Gordon, . said the judge's comments came as a shock and that Beatie plans to . appeal the ruling. He said Beatie legally was married as a man and never . was required to disclose that he retained female reproductive organs . when applying for and being granted a new birth certificate in Hawaii as . a man. He said Beatie halted testosterone treatments so that he could . give birth to his children. 'It's unfortunate that the judge out here doesn't recognize marriage in another state,' Gordon said. More babies: 'Hypothetically we have talked about starting a family together and we would have to check out our fertility options' Beatie is eager to end his marriage, . but the couple's divorce plans stalled last summer when Gerlach said he . was unable to find legal authority defining a man as someone who can . give birth. Gerlach's ruling didn't address . whether Arizona law allows a person who was born female to marry another . female after undergoing a sex change operation. A separate ruling issued Friday by . Gerlach sets guidelines on how the Beaties will co-parent their three . children and grants them joint authority in making legal decisions. Thomas Beatie is required to pay nearly $240 a month to Nancy Beatie for . child support, but she won't get alimony because the marriage was . declared invalid. Nancy Beatie's attorney, David . Higgins, praised Gerlach for the thoroughness of the decision on the . marriage, although it wasn't the one she had hoped for. 'He still sees a same-sex marriage, but he gave us all the rulings that we're asking for as far as the children,' Higgins said. Thomas Beatie shows off his pregnant stomach before becoming the first man to give birth . The National Center for Lesbian . Rights, which isn't involved in the Beatie divorce case, has said courts . have declared marriages involving a transgender person invalid in a . handful of cases across the country, but that those cases had different . factual and legal issues than those in the Beatie case.

Mullan, who has five prior DUI arrests and a . suspended license, was led away . in tears from the scene. The . much-loved grandparents, who were teachers, had moved recently from Indiana to the West Coast . and were pronounced dead at the scene. Pediatric nurse Karina and . son, Elias Ulkiksen-Schulte are now in a critical condition at . Harborview Medical Center in Seattle. According to Q13fox.com, a . fundraising page has now been set up to help with medical costs for the . young mother and baby. Those behind it are trying to raise $2,500 to . support the family. The page reads: 'This fundraising page is being created for our friends who recently . were involved in a car accident in their hometown of Seattle.

Mullan is being held on investigation . of vehicular homicide and vehicular assault. Prosecutors have until . Thursday to formally charge him. A police officer said in court . documents that he smelled alcohol on Mullan's breath and that Mullan . showed impairment on sobriety tests. A preliminary test showed a breath . alcohol level of 0.22, nearly three times the legal limit of 0.08, the . officer said. His license . was suspended at the time of the crash at an intersection in a . residential neighborhood, according to the documents. 'He does not have a . valid license,' said Brad Benfield, a spokesman with the Department of . Licensing. He also did . not have an ignition interlock device installed on his Chevrolet . pick-up, which an earlier court ruling ordered him to have installed. 'They were so elated. This is their only grandchild,' said Judith Schulte's sister, Susan Morton. Karina Schulte 'had the baby in a sling on the front. He just hit all four of them,' said Morton, of Cottonwood, Minn., in a telephone interview. Mullan told police he was unable to see the pedestrians because the sun was in his eyes, according to court documents. His license was suspended at the time of the crash, according to the documents. 'He does not have a valid license,' said Brad Benfield, a spokesman with the Department of Licensing. It was unclear Tuesday whether Mullan had legal representation. A message left with an attorney who represented him in a drunken driving case in December was not immediately returned Tuesday. Mullan didn't answer reporters' questions as police led him away from the scene of the crash in handcuffs Monday. Police said he stopped after the crash and was cooperative. A phone number listed for Mullan was disconnected. The Schulte's had just moved from Indiana to be near their new-born grandchild who was delivered just two weeks ago . Mullan has a history of driving drunk. His most recent arrest for drunken driving was on Christmas Day when he struck a Seattle motel and was found to have a blood-alcohol content four times the legal limit. Prior to the Christmas Day arrest, Mullan was arrested four other times related to driving under the influence. In October of 2012, Mullan was arrested by Washington State Patrol in his black Chevrolet pickup, after speeding on the Alderwood Mall Parkway. His blood-alcohol level was measured at .14 per cent. His Christmas Day arrest came after he drove into The Seals Motel in Seattle on two separate occasions on the same evening. Police wrote that he was so intoxicated he could not get out of his truck without help. He also provided police with a false name - his twin brothers' - something that he has done at least once before according to police documents. On that occasion his blood alcohol level measured .32 percent, which is more than four times the legal limit. Police believed that he was so drunk that they called paramedics and sent him to Harborview Medical Center. The victims were crossing 33rd Avenue Northeast at Northeast 75th Street in Seattle, with Ulriksen-Schulte carrying her son, when the pickup struck them . At the time of his accident his license was suspended due to the five prior occasions he had been in trouble with the law. Morton said Karina Schulte, who is from Chile, works as a pediatric nurse specialist and is dedicated to her work. Dennis and Judith Schulte were both longtime high school teachers; she taught English and was a head guidance counselor at Northwestern High School for years, while he taught math and coached at Western High School. 'People like her don't come around very often,' said Northwestern High School Principal Al Remaly. 'She was just all about the kids and all about anything she could do for them.' Judy's brother, J. Hugh Dwyer, said his sister and her husband made a big impact in their community. 'Between the two of them, they probably positively influenced thousands of high school students,' he said. They had moved to Seattle from Kokomo in February to witness the birth of their first grandson. They had planned to spend six months in Seattle to be near their son and his family. They were renting an apartment near the intersection where they were killed. 'They were so elated. This is their only grandchild,' Morton said. 'They wanted to be there when he was born. They got to hold him and be there with him for 10 days.' Judy Schulte was a dedicated volunteer at Kokomo Urban Outreach , said DeAnna Ancil, who directs the group's food pantry operations. Ancil said Judy Schulte 'beamed' about having a grandchild. Friends and relatives say the couple had begun planning a move to Seattle when they learned Ulriksen-Schulte was expecting their first grandchild . 'That's the positive thing, that they were able to see the grandchild and enjoy him for two weeks and enjoy the family connection,' Ancil said. 'But (it's) just such a shock still for all of us.' Retired teachers Judy and Dennis Schulte had devoted their lives to helping children. 'That was their thing, and they were very good at it,' said Reverand Ronald Mann, pastor of Russiaville United Methodist Church near Kokomo, to the Seattle Times. 'They were wonderful people who will be greatly missed. 'They were both very active in the life of our church,' said Mann, who noted Judy Schulte was in charge of the children’s ministry and gave sermons to children. Ulriksen-Schulte, who suffered a crushed pelvis and cranial bleeding, and Elias, whose injuries were not disclosed, were in critical condition Tuesday at Harborview Medical Center. The Schultes celebrated their 40th wedding anniversary in June 2011. Judy Schulte worked as a guidance counselor and teacher at Indiana's Northwestern Schools and colleague Ryan Snoddy said that even after her retirement in 2008, she still would return to help. 'She was a great lady who inspired a lot of kids,' he said. 'Judy and Dennis were doing what they loved, which is spending time with their family. To have this kind of tragedy just really takes the breath out of you.'

The daughter of disgraced politician John Edwards has had a complicated relationship with her father that was put to the test by a public sex scandal and legal woes, but she has never doubted her father was innocent of the federal charges brought against him. In 2011, the Democratic presidential candidate was indicted on six felony counts for allegedly misusing campaign funds in an effort to hide his relationship with his videographer-turned-mistress Rielle Hunter. Despite her anger over her father’s infidelity that played out while her mother was dying of cancer, Cate Edwards, 31, dropped everything to be there every day of the criminal trial. Scroll down for video . Loyal daughter: Cate Edwards, right, said that it never crossed her mind to gloat over her father's legal troubles or think of him as a criminal . In an interview with NBC's Savannah Guthrie, Miss Edwards said that it never crossed her mind to gloat over her father’s legal troubles or think of him as a criminal. ‘I did not fault my bad for the trial,’ she said. ‘He made those mistakes, there is no question, but I had never, ever felt he did anything illegal.’ A federal jury eventually found Edwards not guilty on one count and deadlocked on the others. The disgraced politician’s daughter revealed that it was hard on the family to see a very private and difficult chapter of their lives ‘rehashed in front of everyone.’ ‘But there was nowhere else I would have rather been at the time,’ Miss Edwards said. . When asked about her father’s future in politics, Cate Edwards replied that she highly doubts he will ever run for office again. Edwards also addressed her relationship with her 4-year-old half-sister, who was conceived out of her father's love affair with his videographer during his bid for the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination. 'She's my sister... she's just a really sweet, innocent little girl,' Cate Edwards, 31, said of 4-year-old Quinn Hunter in an interview with NBC's Savannah Guthrie. 'I certainly think of her as part of our family.' Quinn is the daughter of John Edwards' former mistress Rielle Hunter, whom Cate said she hasn't seen in years. Hunter has recently published a tell-all book about her romance with the former North Carolina senator. Devastated: John Edwards' daughter Cate said that her father was the one to tell her about his affair with videographer Rielle Hunter . Stepping out: Cate Edwards sat down for her first interview about her father John's affair . 'She's my sister:' Cate Edwards said she maintains a relationship with her 4-year-old half sister, Quinn, (pictured with Edwards), who was conceived out of her father's love affair . Cate Edwards said she met Rielle while she was working on her father's campaign and that she hasn't seen her since. Asked about Rielle's book, Edwards said, 'I thought it was a poor choice... that's all I can say.' Edwards said she was angry at her father when he told her about the affair, but that she eventually forgave him. 'I was devastated, and I was disappointed,' she said. 'Forgiveness is a tough thing... It was hard, but we worked through it.' She couldn't answer to whether her . father was every forgiven by her mother, Elizabeth Edwards, who died of . cancer less than three years ago at the age of 61. Siblings: Cate Edwards has two younger siblings, . Emma Claire, who is 14, and Jack, who is 12, who are now being raised . by her father . 'I think she did [forgive him],' Edwards said of her mother. 'I don't know the answer to that. 'I think . she had a mix of emotions.' Despite the affair, John Edwards wanted to be by Elizabeth's side on her deathbed. 'He called and said, ""Can I come?"" Cate recalled. 'I said, ""Mom, can Dad come?"" And she said ""yes.""' Looking back on their final moments . together, she said, 'The three of us, especially, have been through so . much together, so we garner a lot of strength from one another, and I . think being together during that time - and also for the kids, to have . their family together during that time - was incredibly important.' Cate Edwards has two younger siblings, Emma Claire, who is 14, and Jack, who is 12, who are now being raised by her father. She was very close to her mother, . telling NBC that she was particularly upset by her mother's absence from . her October 2011 wedding. Family: Cate was very close to her mother Elizabeth (seen here in 2008), who died of cancer in 2010, and ever since Cate has been helping raise her younger siblings Emma Claire and Jack . Big day: Cate got married in 2011, and her sister Emma Claire (right) served in the wedding party. She said that her wedding was one of the biggest days that she missed her mother . Love: Cate Edwards' husband says she's a deeply compassionate woman . But she also misses her mother in small ways every day, she said. 'I mean, I get away with bad grammar,' she said, grinning. 'I never used to get away with bad grammar.' The affair between Edwards and Hunter . began while he was campaigning for the highest office in the land back . in 2004, and he waited until it was clear that he would neither be the . presidential nor vice presidential nominee to sit down in 2008 and admit . that he had cheated on his popular wife Elizabeth. In a 2008 interview, Edwards said that he did have an affair with Hunter but he was not the father of her daughter Quinn. He later retracted this statement. Speaking out: Cate was listed as a possible witness during the trial but she was never called to the stand . Throughout the ordeal, Edwards' aide Andrew Young volunteered to pretend that he was the father of Hunter's child, and they used nearly $1million to cover Hunter's tracks, flying her across country with the Youngs and keeping her hidden in various mansions. That money was the focus of the federal trial against Edwards, where they had to prove that the money used to hide Hunter was given by personal donors who understood that it was not so much a political donation to Edwards' campaign but that it was being used to help hide the word of the affair. Cate was actually listed by the defense as a possible witness in Edwards' case, but she was never actually called to the stand. The public attention surrounding the Edwards family drama did not die down after the trial ended in May, as Hunter released a tell-all book just a few months later where she trashed Elizabeth. In her book 'What Really Happened: John Edwards, Our Daughter and Me', Hunter describes the Edwards' marriage as broken by the time she arrived on the scene. Rielle Hunter announced last summer that she and her longtime lover John Edwards are 'no longer a couple' She wrote that Elizabeth- who at the time was battling her second bout of breast cancer- was a 'witch on wheels' who belittled her beloved Johnny and was very aware that their marriage was on the outs. Hunter has faced much criticism for painting such a grim portrait of Elizabeth in her book, especially since she died in 2010 and she can no longer respond to Hunter's claims. That criticism was echoed by Cate in her NBC interview, set to air on Friday. 'I just thought it was — I thought it was a poor choice, I guess, is all I can say,' Cate said diplomatically. As for Hunter's current role in their family, it remains unclear as she said during her book tour that she and 'Johnny' had just decided to end their relationship, though that announcement came just days after they were pictured enjoying a beach vacation with Quinn for Father's Day.","Cate Edwards, 31, said she never thought her father was guilty .

Bryan Oliver, 16, accused of shooting a classmate at a California high school wrote a story posted online about a bullied student who kills his former tormentors as an adult . He pleaded not guilty to two counts of premeditated attempted murder and three counts of assault with a firearm. Friends of Oliver said he was teased by his classmates for his red hair and social awkwardness. Students and parents have said that Oliver was suspended briefly last year after he made a hit list, the newspaper said. The story was posted online last summer and features a character who is tormented by his peers. Bullies douse the character with a bucket of goat's blood at graduation and years later he kills the student who tipped the bucket, according to the newspaper. The story goes on to show how the character killed his persecutors in ways that echo their past harassment. The family of the classmate who was injured in the school shooting has filed a claim against the school district, claiming administrators should have known or knew that Oliver was dangerous.

British people are frequently accused of being reserved, dignified and possessing a stiff upper lip. But according to a new survey, that stereotype is a thing of the past. Instead of keeping private lives tucked away behind closed doors, Brits now share a staggering 67 million pictures, videos and snippets of information every week. And those who regularly update their Facebook status or Twitter feed can be slotted into one of five groups: the Big Softies, the Chatterboxes, the Gizmo Grumpies, the Mobile Butterflies and the iSavers. Irksome: Do you follow Peaches Geldof? If so, you'll have seen plenty of pics, all of baby son Astala, like this . Pets: Like Leona Lewis, pictured with her dog Lily, 'Big Softies like posting photos of their animal companions . 'The study not only gives us new . insight into the motivations behind the different groups sharing content . online, it also paints a touching picture that as a nation, Brits love . to spread happiness by sharing the silly stuff,' said psychologist Susan Quilliam who analysed the results. 'It has become the modern version of the mix tape or . postcard, a way of showing those we’re close to that we care and we’re thinking . of them.' The research, commissioned by mobile phone network Three found that almost half of all British users were so-called 'Big Softies' who use social media to stay in touch with family and friends. Innocuous though most of their posts are, Big Softies do have some annoying habits.These are the users who clog up your Twitter feed with baby photos and inane comments about their pets. The next, and possibly most irritating, group are the Chatterboxes. They are the ones who Instagram every meal, tweet about Kim Kardashian's every movement and, worst of all, indulge in 'humble bragging'. For those yet to come across a humble bragger, these users post thinly disguised boasts which are all the more irksome for the attempt at concealment. While the worst offenders are usually celebrities - step forward Oprah Winfrey and reality star Tila Tequila - the trend is filtering through into everyday use. Typical examples include 'Got told I look like Jessica Alba today #iamsoconfused' and 'Just gave £100 to the homeless man outside the station. Irrational kindness is so cool.' Humble brag alert! If you didn't know that One Direction star, Louis Tomlinson, can play guitar, you do now! But it's not all bad news for Chatterboxes.

Plans for traditional Easter egg hunts and family walks will have to be put on hold tomorrow as the UK prepares itself for yet another chilly day. The elusive spring weather will once again be eclipsed by low temperatures, although forecasters predict that the sun will make an appearance.

The Environment Agency has released an . amber flood alert warning that floods are possible . between Putney Embankment and Teddington Lock. Flooding is also possible in the south east of the city near Trowlock Island, according to an Environment Agency amber warning. The high water levels are caused by . spring tides, which are especially strong tides occurring when the moon . is full or new and aligned with the Earth and the sun. Spring tides are not affected by the season of Spring but by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun combined. No floods caused by rain are expected . over Easter, with the Met Office predicting the weather to be mostly . dry. The wheels of parked cars along the riverside were submerged in water after the Thames burst its banks in south west London . Water levels were much higher than usual in Putney and the path along the riverside became impassable on foot . Temperatures dropped to -11C in the . Scottish highlands last night and the weather will continue to be colder . than normal for spring. Forecaster Greg Dewhurst said: 'There has been sleet and snow showers in eastern areas like Middlesbrough and down towards the south today but the snow has been scattered and light. 'These showers have been coming in from the east and may just about reach the east of Wales. 'For Easter Sunday it's looking dry across most of the UK with long sunny spells. Temperatures over the bank holiday could drop to -2C and could fall further to -10C in the north of Scotland overnight. 'Tomorrow we could see wintry showers in the afternoon in areas such as Bournemouth, Southampton and Brighton but any snow will be more like sleet, and shouldn't stick or cause any travel problems.

The cars of the Cambridge team were left under water as they trained for the Easter Sunday Boat Race on the Thames . The Cambridge crew parked up on the river bank but their cars were left soggy when the Thames reached high tide . Every . year crowds line the four-and-a-quarter mile course from Putney to . Mortlake to support the two teams in a race which tends to last just . over 15 minutes. Earlier . this week the Cambridge team were caught out by the Thames tides after . their vehicles parked up nearby were submerged in water from the . flooding river. Both teams have had to take care to . avoid large pieces of debris coming down the river in high tides as they . prepared for Sunday's contest. University Boat Race spokesperson Maria O'Connor said: 'As the race is just over four miles long that gives the crowds eight miles of riverside to watch from. 'So while there are areas that may flood, other parts of the stretch will be fine to watch from. 'As high tide is just after 6pm and the race starts at 4.30pm so the race doesn't take place when the tide is at its highest.' Last year's Boat Race was interrupted . when 36-year-old anti-elitist protester Trenton Oldfield swam in front . of the rowers. He was handed a six-month prison sentence.

Last year's race had to be halted when Trenton Oldfield swam into the . path of the Oxford and Cambridge university crews, narrowly avoiding . being struck by an oar. Organisers have warned against a repeat of anyone taking to the water . for the 159th race, with the Marines set to patrol eight miles of the . River Thames in inflatable boats. Boat Race executive director David Searle said: ‘We are taking . additional measures this year and have reviewed all of our actions last . year in detail. ‘The Boat Race course is four and a quarter miles long so we have eight and a half miles of riverbank to manage and monitor. ‘What I would say to anybody thinking of disrupting the race is that . it's unbelievably dangerous. You risk injuring yourself, the crews and . the other people following the race. ‘Nobody wants that to happen. This is just a sporting event.’ Oldfield, 36, was released from prison in December having served seven . weeks of a six-month sentence after being found guilty of causing a . public nuisance. He has since been contacted by the Metropolitan Police by letter and on . Twitter to establish whether he was planning any action this year, . saying they were ‘keen to facilitate any peaceful protest’. In a statement, the police stressed they were not offering to organise a . protest but to afford him the opportunity to exercise his ‘lawful . rights without causing disruption or danger to themselves or others’. However, Oldfield told The Spectator he would ‘probably have a ramble across the Cotswolds instead’. Oxford have emerged as clear favourites to win the race after more than . 70 per cent of bets were placed on the Dark Blues, according to bookmaker . William Hill. Spokesman Joe Crilly said: ‘Oxford are certainly the best backed crew as . of yet, although that was very much the case at this stage of . proceedings last year. ‘Last year, however, we took nearly £40,000 on the day of the race and . Cambridge became best backed by the time the race started. Maybe history . will repeat itself this time around.’ There have been calls for supporters to boycott the Cambridge team over . claims that it plans to build a new boat house which will threaten . wildlife. Mark Avery, the former head of conservation at the RSPB and Cambridge . student, told the Daily Telegraph that the building project is in danger . of wiping out otters and bitterns on the Great Ouse river. ‘I hope that the Cambridge boat sinks in Sunday's University Boat Race,’ he said. ‘Why? Because the Cambridge University Boat Club is planning to build a . new boathouse (although it is far more than just a boathouse) on one of . the best sites for otters in Cambridgeshire, and its impact on local . wildlife will be severe.’ But Project Ely, the group working to provide the new facility, have . stressed the boat house would be built sensitively to protect its . natural surroundings, the paper reported.","Easter weekend will be dry and chilly across most of the UK, forecasters say .

Filth: Prince Charles' neighbour Clive Wilson with some of the rubbish left by Cotswold District Council, outside his home in Doughton, Gloucestershire . Angry Cotswolds neighbours of Prince Charles have slammed their local council after waste in their village lay uncollected for a month. Unsightly piles of rubbish have built up close to the entrance to his Highgrove estate, attracting vermin. Residents of Doughton in Gloucestershire, where the council tax on a band D property is just under £1,500 a year, missed out on their regular pick up after snow hit on January 19. Cotswold District Council’s waste contractor Ubico cancelled collections for a week across the whole district, claiming the slippery conditions were too dangerous for the workers. But instead of putting on extra collections as soon as the roads were clear, it told residents they would have to wait until their next scheduled round – in Doughton that meant yet another fortnight. 'We’ve only had one since the middle of December. The service has been an utter disgrace since Christmas,' said farmer Clive Wilson, aged 50, a neighbour of the Prince's estate. 'We’re in an area of outstanding natural beauty yet the council seems happy to let it look like a rubbish dump for weeks. 'I understand the health and safety aspect and I wouldn’t want any binmen to be injured, but what about our health and safety? 'The rats and foxes have had a go at the sacks and the litter is spreading. 'The council should have put on extra rounds as soon as it was safe, but I guess they weren’t prepared to pay for the overtime.' Less than two miles down the road in the small town of Tetbury residents have also complained of having to leave bins out on the pavement. The rubbish left outside Elmestree House. Elmestree is next door to Prince Charles' country home, Highgrove . There has been no collection since mid-January and the rubbish has been piling up . The council organised emergency waste collection points in Cirencester and Tetbury on February 4, but householders had to transport their rubbish there themselves. Cotswold District Council came under fire from council taxpayers two years ago years ago when accounts revealed it paid £19,000 to magician Shay McConnon to boost staff morale at a time when it was cutting £1.4million from its budget. Ubico was also heavily criticised for suspending collections for over a week in Cheltenham. The firm is owned by the district council and Cheltenham Borough Council. Neither were available for comment at time of writing. Mounting piles of bin bags sit outside of properties in Tetbury, Gloucestershire .

It's hardly a surprise these days when two female TV stars are involved in a public contretemps.Unless, that is, they have a combined age of 157. The warring pair are presenter Joan Bakewell, 79, and cake-maker supreme Mary Berry, 78-year-old hostess of the Great British Bake Off. And the issue in question is women’s rights. Despite their closeness in age, their opinions are deeply different. Baroness Bakewell has launched a stinging attack on Miss Berry’s lifestyle, saying she belongs in ‘a completely different world’. Renowned for her liberal attitudes towards sex and for an illicit affair with playwright Harold Pinter, the Labour peeress once known as the ‘thinking man’s crumpet’ contrasted her own ‘whizzy’ life with Miss Berry’s ‘stable and unchanging’ world view. She was responding to comments the cookery writer made in January. Dismissing feminism as a ‘dirty word’, Miss Berry insisted she did not want women’s rights and said she loves it when men offer to carry her coat. ‘When I read that, I felt that Mary belonged in a completely different world,’ fumed Baroness Bakewell. ‘What she said sounded very lovely and cosy and rural, and very stable and unchanging. I thought that was fine for her. ‘But perhaps I have lived a bit more of a whizzy life out and about, and my life has been a little bit more rackety. Of course feminism has mattered a great deal to me and matters still. ‘I think Mary would expect to be paid a decent wage for the job she does and she would probably expect to be paid as much as a man. So to that extent she is a feminist without realising it.’ Recipe for success: Cake expert Mary Berry . Joan Bakewell rose to fame in 1965 as the presenter of BBC2’s Late Night Line-Up, which became renowned for its open discussions of taboo subjects including sex, abortion, divorce and homosexuality. It was later revealed she had a seven-year affair with playwright Harold Pinter while they were both married. Twice divorced, she now lives alone in Primrose Hill, north London. Miss Berry’s career and personal life, on the other hand, has followed a much more traditional trajectory. In 1966, she published the Hamlyn All Colour Cookbook and wed Paul Hunnings. They have three children and are still married. Miss Berry, whose work includes a celebrated recipe for Bakewell Tart, said she loves it when men offer to fetch her coat or give up their seat on the bus, adding: ‘I’m thrilled to bits. I’m not a feminist.’ The claws are out: Joan Bakewell, right, said that Mary Berry, left, 'belonged in a completely different world' when Berry said that feminist is a 'dirty word' But Baroness Bakewell insisted such gestures should be ‘common decency’ for both sexes. She said: ‘Men don’t offer to open the door for me any more. But the opening of doors and things is really a matter of courtesy, and I am really rather in favour of courtesy. I think you have to be polite to each other whatever your gender. It is just common decency and manners between individuals. ‘I always share the bill at restaurants, though I am perhaps somewhat old for what you might call a date. I go out for meals with male friends. Sometimes the very rich ones pay. I name no names. Very different women: A young Mary Berry, left, has always followed a traditional lifestyle, whereas the life of Joan Bakewell, right, has been 'rackety' as Bakewell describes it . 'Some of them are inclined to be particularly chivalrous. But chivalry is a little bit out of date because it suggests all these superior, protective roles for men. ‘I think good manners between grown-ups and indeed between children is desirable. If there is a gender-free way of defining it then that suits me better. You can call it chivalry if you like.’ This summer, Baroness Bakewell will present a programme called Sky Arts Portrait Artist of the Year. Family values: Mary Berry with her children Annabel, Thomas and William . Alongside comedian Frank Skinner she will hunt for the UK’s best portrait artist in an open competition held at art fairs across the nation. The winner will be awarded a £10,000 commission to paint Booker-prize winning novelist Hilary Mantel and see the work hung in the National Portrait Gallery. Baroness Bakewell said she was surprised to be offered the work, adding: ‘There are no television programmes for old people. You tend to be shunted across to radio as you get older.’ Swinging Sixties girl: Joan Bakewell has said that she does not want to be remembered by her famous epithet 'the thinking man's crumpet' Born: March 24, 1935. Childhood: Daughter of the mayor of Bath, she was struck down with polio at 13, leaving her with a twisted spine and weak left arm. Schooldays: ‘I was naughty, a real monkey, hopeless at academic subjects.’ Career: Published more than 70 books in nearly half a century as a cook before appearing in Great British Bake Off. Awarded a CBE in 2012 for services to  culinary arts. Family: Married to retired bookseller Paul Hunnings, 80, for 46 years and recently admitted: ‘I spoil him rotten’. They have two surviving children, Annabel, 41, and Tom, 44. In 1989, their middle son William was killed in a car accident, aged 19. She recently said: ‘Having children is the greatest thing that can happen to you as a husband and wife. I was brought up to believe that it’s family first.’ Born: April 16, 1933 . Childhood: Brought up in Stockport, sent to elocution lessons by her mother to eradicate her northern accent. Head girl at high school before reading economics and history at women-only Newnham College, Cambridge. Schooldays: ‘I actually had a crush on another girl who was a couple of forms ahead of me, but I never made known my love; I just worshipped from a distance.’ Career: Earned nickname ‘thinking man’s crumpet’ as a presenter on BBC2’s Late Night Line-Up between 1965 and 1972. Moved to Granada before returning to the corporation as Newsnight’s arts correspondent. Awarded a CBE in 1999 and a life peerage in 2011. Family: Marriage to Michael Bakewell ended in 1972. They had a son and a daughter while she had an affair with Harold Pinter. Second marriage to Jack Emery ended in 2001.","Joan Bakewell said Mary Berry belongs in ‘a completely different world’

Turbulent relationship: Angie Bowie with the singer and son Zowie, now Duncan Jones, in February 1974 at a Hotel in Amsterdam . It has been lauded by critics as one of the greatest comebacks in the history of pop. But David Bowie's return has failed to impress his ex-wife, who has called his latest material 'diabolical'. Angie Bowie, who was married to the singer for ten years, has dismissed his new album, claiming he hasn't written a good song since 1974. She said: 'I listened to the first single  – Where Are We Now? – and it was just awful, just diabolical. The second one was worse than that. 'This is supposed to be the greatest comeback of the century? It's boring. I think every release since the first eight albums has been rubbish.' Bowie's album, The Next Day, is released today. Where Are We Now? was released in January to the surprise of fans who believed the 66-year-old star had retired after a heart attack in 2004. Tilda Swinton plays the singer's lover in the video for second single The Stars (Are Out Tonight). Bowie fans have speculated that the character is based on Angie and their turbulent relationship. However, the 63-year-old former model, who lives in the US, said: 'I watched 30 seconds and couldn't cope with any more. The subject matter is too retrospective. 'I am pleased he got out of his house in New York and recorded an album. But why has he been sitting in his house for ten years anyway?' The couple married in 1970, having met in the 1960s when she was studying at Kingston Polytechnic and Bowie was trying to get a record deal. She claims they almost missed the ceremony after being up most of the night before enjoying a threesome with a mutual female friend. Where are they now? David Bowie with his supermodel wife Iman, who he has been married to for 20 years . She said: 'David was big on threesomes with both men and women - the whole nine yards. And I was right in there. 'The night before our wedding it was a mutual friend of ours. We went . out for dinner, back to her place and had plenty of lively sex. We had a . very late night and didn't go to bed until 3am or 4am. 'Then we woke up late in north London and had to be in Bromley by 10am . to get married. We just about got there in time and staggered in. 'It was a bullsh*t romance. When he asked me to marry him, he said, 'And . I don't love you, by the way.' 'He had told me before we married he . didn't love me, so of course he was not going to be faithful. As it was . the Sixties I suppose they called it free love.' Angie, who now works as a journalist . specialising in transgender issues, also spoke about the morning she . allegedly caught her husband and Rolling Stones frontman Mick together . in the marital bed of their home in Chelsea in 1973. Boring? David Bowie's much-anticipated new album The Next Day is released today . She said: 'They were not only in bed together, they were naked. I walked . into the bedroom and David was there with all these pillows and duvets . on top of him and on the other side of the bed was Mick's leg sticking . out. 'I said: 'Did you guys have a good night?'. They were so hung over . they could hardly speak. I took pity on them.' Angie claimed Bowie's fascination with Mick came from his desire to . 'seduce' all his major rock rivals, saying: 'In our living room as we . watched Top Of The Pops, David was constantly wanting The Rolling Stones . to move over to the States. 'He decided he would seduce him like he . seduced any competition. But I don't think it was a big love affair with . Mick. It was probably more drunken pawing.' Break up: Angie says she £500,000 from Bowie, paid over ten years, after the couple broke up . They went on to have son Duncan together, but split in 1980. She then had a daughter Stacia with punk musician Drew Blood while Bowie has been married to model wife Iman, 57, for 20 years. After the couple divorced in 1980, Angie says she received £500,000 from Bowie - paid over ten years. 'It was in tiny installments - like a child with an allowance - I couldn't even buy a house. 'When I broke up with David I didn't recover for six years for him not paying me for managing him. Maybe I never got over it.'","Angie Bowie said the singer has not written a good song since 1974 .

The man accused of beating his four-year-old stepson to death sent a number of disturbing text messages to his wife - and mother of the boy - about 'breaking his ego' and referring to him as a 'pit bull'. A preliminary hearing is underway for Nathan Sloop, 34. He and his wife Stephanie, 30, are accused in the shocking and brutal murder of her son Ethan Stacy, whose body was found in a shallow grave in the mountains on May 11, 2010. His face was beaten beyond recognition with a hammer, his body was burned and dog food was sprinkled over him. Innocent: Officials said Ethan suffered about 10 days worth of severe abuse, including starvation, burning and beatings . Accused child murderer: Nathan Sloop arrives for the first day of his preliminary hearing on Wednesday, March 27, 2013, at Second District Court in Farmington, Utah . 'I told you we had a pit bull on our hands, but they learn,' Sloop messaged Stephanie on May 3, 2010. 'Just like Mommy LOL,' she replied. 'I told you we had to break his ego,' Sloop texted. Then on May 5 she wrote: 'He is broke that's for sure.' Sloop replied they 'had to figure out how to keep him in his room'. Both face capital murder and other charges in the boy's death. Prosecutors plan to seek the death penalty against Sloop. In addition to capital murder, the . defendant also faces charges of obstructing justice and intentionally . inflicting serious injury on a child, and desecration of a dead body, Desert News reported. In court yesterday, prosecutor David . Cole said it was Sloops' 'reckless indifference to human life' that . caused the boy's death. He said Ethan was scalded, beaten, over-medicated and not given the medical care that he needed. Nathan Sloop wasn't on the stand yesterday, but his own words were read and played in court from recorded phone calls, taped police interviews and transcripts of interviews, according to Deseret News. Crime and punishment: Nathaniel Sloop, left, could face the death penalty for allegedly beating his stepson, four-year-old Ethan Stacy, right, to death in 2010 while the boy was staying with his biological mother . Judge Glen Dawson presides over the evidentiary hearing for Nathanael Sloop in 2nd District Court as he speaks with lawyers for the prosecution and defense at an evidentiary hearing prior to Sloop's preliminary hearing . The defense argues the boy was given too much Benadryl, Tylenol and decongestant and died from dehydration. The court heard tapes wherein Sloop told police he would slap the child, make him stand with his nose against the wall and once pushed him into scalding water. He also described a time when both he and Stephanie put feces into his mouth and said they never took him to hospital when he was sick. '(Ethan) had seen things and heard things that a four-year-old boy should never see or hear,' he said. The court also heard a jail-house phone call to his mother when Sloop called Ethan 'poison' that sunk his relationship with Stephanie Sloop 'like a battleship'. He also said the boy was disobedient and misbehaved, often sneaking from his room and turning on video games or going to the refrigerator. Layton Police Sgt Jeff Roderick reported that there were traces of blood found on the wall of Ethan's room, believed to be from the boy's nose rubbing against the wall. In a short video shown to the court, Ethan can be seen looking dishevelled with some redness on his cheek. He says to the camera: 'I'm having fun with Nathan. He's not scary anymore.' In an audio recording also played in court, Nathan Sloop can be heard asking Ethan numerous times whether he wanted to stay in Utah or return to live with his father in Virginia. He repeatedly asked the boy if his father was mean or hurt him. 'Where do you want to live?' Sloop asked. Through tears and wheezing, Ethan croaks back: 'My mom, my mom, my mom.' Sloop pleaded not guilty to the charges last year. Asked if they would consider a plea deal, Sloop's attorney, Richard Mauro, said that they are just preparing for the preliminary hearings and waiting to see what the prosecution presents as evidence. Mauro said he plans to challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty as part of a series of motions he'll file. Sloop's wife, Stephanie Sloop, 30, faces identical charges for contributing to her son's death or failing to stop it, but it remains unknown whether or not the prosecutors will seek the death penalty for her. She is due back in court April12. Courtroom procedure: Judge Glen Dawson, left, set the pretrial hearing for Sloop, right, for March 27-29 . Two homes: Ethan Stacy pictured with his biological father Joe Stacy . Authorities say the boy was beaten, malnourished and left behind one day as the couple left to exchange wedding vows. Ethan Stacy died 10 days after his arrival to Utah from his birth father's home across country. The birth father, Joe G. Stacy, of Tazewell, Virginia, has said he was forced to give up Ethan during the summer as part of a divorce and custody battle. Nathanael and Stephanie Sloop initially reported the boy missing, before confessing to police that they had buried his body near a ski resort. Sloop told police he took the hammer to the boy's face so that he wouldn't be recognizable. No trial date has been set. Attorneys on both sides declined to speculate about when that could occur. According to authorities, four-year-old Ethan arrived in Utah in late April 2010 to spend time with his biological mother and her then-fiance. Court documents cited by The Salt Lake Tribune show that between April 29 and May 8, 2010, the toddler had been subjected to 'severe abuse,' which included beatings, burning, drugging, isolating, starving and refusing to seek medical attention. Two of a kind: Nathan Sloop, left, and his wife and Ethan's biological mother, Stephanie Sloop, right, reported the boy missing a day before his disfigured and burned body was discovered in a shallow grave near a ski resort . Heart-breaking: The Sloops allegedly left the little boy beaten and locked up at home while they went to get married in May 2010 . Investigators say that on the day of Nathan and Stephanie Sloop's wedding May 6, the child was locked in an apartment bedroom on his own because the couple feared people would call police if they saw the toddler's injuries. Following her arrest, Stephanie Sloop told police that on May 7, 2010, she got a call from her husband saying that her son had burned himself while taking a bath, according to CBS News. When the mother reached home, probable cause documents state she found Ethan with severe burns to his feet and along the back of his legs. She also noticed what she described as human feces in the four-year-old's mouth. Mrs Sloop told police that she did not seek medical help for her injured son because she was afraid that Nathan Sloop would harm her if she tried to do so. On Mother's Day, May 10, 2010, Stephanie and Nathan Sloop reported the boy missing after discovering that Ethan had died, according to prosecutors. The Sloops told police that the toddler wandered out of the apartment in Layton. However, the following evening, the child's remains were discovered wrapped in plastic and dumped in a shallow grave near Powder Mountain in Weber County. The four-year-old's face was severely disfigured, and there was dog food sprinkled on his grave.","Ethan Stacy's body was found with dog food sprinkled over it in the mountains in May 2010 .

Sarah said: 'I stayed in the tunnel outside the arena to avoid being crushed when all hell broke loose at about 5am. 'Men were ripping open fire doors . that were locked. Once opened, they fought to get through one side of a . double door. 'Children were getting crushed and screaming. It was . horrible. By far the worst night of my life.' Emily .

Emily . told how the men were smoking cannabis, swearing loudly and pushing . genuine fans out of the way throughout the night, from about 10.30pm. Fans were told not to travel to the arena's box office when the concerts were announced, the venue has said. A spokesman for Manchester Arena said: 'Since the Beyonce dates were announced two weeks ago we strongly advised all customers not to travel to the venue box office as tickets could not be guaranteed due to the anticipated high demand. 'Unfortunately, when we opened our doors at 5.30am what had been an orderly queue immediately stormed the box office windows causing a potential crush. 'Despite the best efforts of our stewards and security staff we had to involve British Transport Police in an attempt to restore order. Even then the safety of genuine fans could not be guaranteed and, following police advice, the box office remained closed. 'This information was communicated via our PA system and customers were redirected to the official website and phone lines for tickets.' She was so scared that she called her mother, Debbie, in distress at 1am. Her mother was so horrified when she turned up that she called the police twice. Emily said: 'It was really horrible. It was intimidating and frightening - one of the scariest nights of my life. 'These men were smoking drugs, they were so aggressive and more and more turned up into the night. They were pushing in and drinking. We were all so excited about seeing Beyonce - we love her - but this was more like a nightmare.' Debbie, 47, said around 300 people were queuing for tickets - and she estimated that lots looked like ticket touts. She is making a formal complaint to the Arena. She said: 'It was absolutely disgusting the way that it was handled. 'I ended up calling the police twice and it got really bad when the lads started ripping the doors open. They were trying to fight their way to the box office but nobody seemed to be doing anything about it. 'The situation was out of control and it’s so unfair that people like my daughter had to go through that - and end up ticketless.' Dozens of fans also posted of their anger on Twitter. One wrote: '100s of Beyonce fans crushed and camped out. Turned away due to health and safety. Was no organisation. Appalling.' The US singer - who thrilled millions with her spectacular performance at the Super Bowl earlier this month - is visiting Manchester on May 7, 8 and 9 as part of her world tour.

He said: 'At about 5.30am one of the security guards led us through the car park and into a corridor. 'As they opened the door people started running to get to the front of the corridor but the security guard wouldn't open the other door. 'I had a panic attack - if it wasn't for my friend I would have collapsed. It was traumatising, I couldn't breathe and I could just hear screaming. In the end the doors came off their hinges.' Shaun was left with bruised ribs and a bruised knee after the crush and had to take yesterday off work to recover. He said: 'We came home on the minibus in silence. None of us could believe what had happened.'","Tickets to the 11 shows sell out within 15 minutes .
