"Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN) -- The owner of a Bangladeshi apparel factory where 112 people died in a fire in November 2012 has been arrested and sent to jail. Delwar Hossain, the owner and managing director of Tazreen Fashions, and his wife, Mahmuda Akther, the chairwoman, surrendered Sunday and were ordered to jail by Metropolitan Magistrate Mohammad Tajul Islam. The magistrate denied bail. Most of those killed at the factory were female workers. More than 200 people were injured, and nearly half of the victims were burned beyond recognition. The government supervised the taking of their DNA before burying them. In December, a Bangladeshi criminal investigation found 13 people guilty of gross negligence of safety measures. They were charged with ""culpable homicide,"" according to a court official. There were arrest warrants issued for six people, including Hossain and Akther. The other warrants were for officials of the company. The factory makes clothes for Western retailers. Ready-made garments make up 80% of Bangladesh's $24 billion in annual exports.","Delwar Hossain and his wife, Mahmuda Akther, are arrested and jailed .

"(CNN) -- At least 22 schoolchildren died in northeastern India after eating free school lunches that contained a poison, a state official said. More than 25 others were hospitalized in Bihar state, said Bihar Education Minister P.K. Shahi, after ingesting an insecticide that was in the food. One remains critical, the hospital said. The poison was organophosphorus, a chemical that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says is commonly used in agriculture. It is a nerve agent related to sarin gas, which is used in chemical warfare, the U.S. Health Department says. Exposure to a high dose can cause an irregular heartbeat, difficulty breathing, paralysis and seizures. Shahi told CNN the school's cook had questioned the quality of the oil she was being asked to use but was overruled by the head teacher. He said: ""The information which has come to me indeed suggests that the headmistress was told by the cook that medium of cooking was not proper, and she suspected the quality of the oil. But the headmistress rebuked her, and chastised the children, and forced them to continue the meal."" CNN has not been able to contact the headmistress. A program providing one free hot meal a day to school children has proved incredibly popular as part of India's wider effort to tackle malnutrition. Children aged 6 months to 14 years get take-home rations or are provided with hot cooked food. The wider $22 billion-a-year welfare scheme aims to sell subsidized wheat and rice to 67% of its 1.2 billion people. According to the Indian government's figures, nearly half of India's children suffer from malnutrition of some sort. Shahi said: ""Twenty million children are being served hot meals in about 73,000 elementary schools. We have been endeavoring to improve the quality ... However, the challenge is still there because the magnitude of this program is so huge that there are a number of challenges."" He added: ""It is really very unfortunate. Even though I would unhesitatingly admit that there are some quality issues before us, but this is the first incident which has happened in the state. In the past we have received complaints regarding quality, but the incident of this nature has happened for the first time. It has really shocked us -- shocked the entire state."" Speaking on CNN's sister network CNN-IBN, district magistrate Abhijit Sinha said an inquiry into the deaths had been launched. CNN-IBN reported that the children were between the ages of 5 and 12 and from Dahrmasati Gandawan, a village in Saran district, Bihar state. It said their deaths Tuesday triggered violent protests Wednesday in Chhapra, the headquarters of Saran district, and a call from politicians for a general strike. Madhusudan Paswan, Saran's district education officer, told CNN that 31 of the affected children were sent from the local Sadar Hospital to Patna Medical College Hospital in the state capital Tuesday night. CNN-IBN quoted Shahi as saying the deaths were a clear result of poisoning, and an investigation would determine whether the contamination was accidental or deliberate. Since a landmark Supreme Court decision in 2001, all government schools in India have been required to provide free meals to students younger than 13.

"(CNN) -- Federal judges tentatively ruled on Monday that California must reduce the number of inmates in its overcrowded prison system by up to 40 percent to stop a constitutional violation of prisoners' rights. California must cut the number of inmates in its prison system by up to 40 percent, judges have ruled. ""Overcrowding is the primary cause of the unconstitutional conditions that have been found to exist in the California prisons,"" the court concluded. California state officials, including Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, immediately promised to appeal the case to the U.S. Supreme Court, if necessary. ""The governor and I strongly disagree with this ruling,"" said Matthew Cate, California's corrections and rehabilitation secretary. Implementing the court's ruling would result in up to 58,000 prisoners being released, Cate said, describing it as a threat to public safety. He disputed the court's contention that the prisons are unsafe the way they are now. But in 2006, Schwarzenegger declared a state of emergency because of ""severe overcrowding"" in California's prisons, saying it had caused ""substantial risk to the health and safety of the men and women who work inside these prisons and the inmates housed in them."" In court documents, the judges said the state's prison system was at about 200 percent of capacity. The ruling is the result of two class-action lawsuits on behalf of California prisoners who said medical and mental health care in the state's prisons are so inadequate that they violate the federal constitution's Eighth Amendment ban against cruel and unusual punishment. The judges said their ruling is tentative so that the parties involved can plan accordingly, essentially giving them an opportunity to work things out themselves before an official ruling is rendered. The court suggests a two- to three-year window for reducing the number of prisoners in the system. Those who would be released would be very low risk, according to Don Specter, director of the Prison Law Office, a group that provides free legal services to California prisoners. He said the ruling would affect those in jail for three or four months because of parole violations, those getting early release dates, and those who might qualify for early release for taking part in rehabilitation programs. A final ruling also probably would reduce the number of people entering the prison system, with many being diverted through the courts and into rehabilitation programs instead of going to jail, Specter said.","Overcrowding has created unconstitutional conditions, judges conclude .

"Washington (CNN) -- The United States has added Caucasus Emirate, a Chechen group based in North Caucasus, to its list of terrorist groups, and authorized an award of up to $5 million for information leading to the location of its leader, the State Department announced Thursday. The designation was made under the authority of a presidential executive order that targets groups and individuals that provide support to terrorists, terrorist organizations or acts of terrorism. In a news release, the State Department said investigators had identified the group's leader, Doku Umarov, as having organized a suicide bombing outside the Chechen Interior Ministry in May 2009. The group also claimed responsibility for the bombing of the Domodedovo airport in Moscow earlier this year that killed 36 people, last year's bombings of the Moscow subway that killed 40, and the bombing of the high-speed Nevsky Express train in 2009 in which 28 people died. Umarov, 47, was born in Kharsenoi, Chechnya, in the former Soviet Union. He has issued several statements in the past encouraging his followers to commit acts of violence against his group's enemies, which include the United States, Israel and the United Kingdom in addition to Russia. ""The designation of Caucasus Emirate is in response to the threats posed to the United States and Russia,"" Ambassador Daniel Benjamin, the Department of State's coordinator for counterterrorism, said in the news release. ""The attacks perpetrated by Caucasus Emirate illustrate the global nature of the terrorist problem we face today. We stand in solidarity with the Russian people in our condemnation of these deplorable terrorist acts."" The State Department said designating Caucasus Emirate as a terrorist group will help support U.S. efforts to reduce the group's ability to mount attacks on Russian interests as it tries to expel the Russian government from the North Caucasus region. The announcement, a culmination of a months-long deliberative interagency process, came the same day President Barack Obama met with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on the sidelines of the G8 summit in Deauville, France. A State Department representative told CNN the timing of the announcement was coincidental to Obama's meeting with Medvedev. The representative could not say whether the Russian government was notified in advance of the announcement.","Caucasus Emirate is added to the U.S. list of terrorist groups .

"(CNN) -- It was a frigid June night at Pickstone Mine in Zimbabwe when 67-year-old Angela Campbell -- soaking wet, her arm broken and a gun to her head -- signed a document vowing to give up the fight for her family's farm. Angela Campbell, 67, was beaten and kidnapped days after Zimbabwe's runoff election. The kidnappers demanding her signature at gunpoint were ""war veterans"" from President Robert Mugabe's heyday as a liberation hero, and they made it clear that her refusal would mean more beatings. Though Campbell signed the document, her son-in-law said she has no intention of giving up her battle; Campbell's family will be in Windhoek, Namibia, on Wednesday to present arguments to a Southern African Development Community tribunal. In pursuing the case, the Campbells and 77 fellow Zimbabwean farmers are risking theft, torture and death for what may be their only remaining chance to save the homes and farms so coveted by Mugabe and his loyalists. Mugabe blames the West for his nation's soaring inflation and poverty. But analysts say Mugabe's 2000 ""resettlement"" policy, in which property was snatched from white farmers and redistributed to landless blacks, is more to blame for the country's turmoil.  Watch a report from the time of the Campbell attack » . ""All I want to see is justice,"" said Richard Etheredge, 72, a white farmer who was evicted from his farm last month. ""The world cannot carry on with criminals."" On June 15, Etheredge, who has joined the case, and his family received word that a Zimbabwean senator planned to take over his Chegutu farm, a process known as ""jambanja."" ""We're going to murder you if we catch you,"" Etheredge recalls an assailant yelling from outside his son's house two days later. The senator bused ""criminals"" to his property, Etheredge said. Etheredge, his wife and one of his twin sons escaped, but the other twin and Etheredge's daughter-in-law were later beaten, he said. Looters stole his computers, farm equipment, antiques, custom gun collection and a safe with billions in Zimbabwean currency (hundreds of thousands in U.S. dollars). Etheredge said he watched the thieves abscond with his possessions in vehicles belonging to the senator. The looters also caused about $1 million in damage to his property, which includes three houses and a fruit-packing plant that was once among the most sophisticated in southern Africa. The Etheredges have been farming for 17 years and, before the attack, were producing 400,000 cartons of navel oranges and kumquats a year, he said. ""The destruction is absolutely incredible,"" Etheredge said. Mugabe's cronies visited the adjacent Mount Carmel farm about two weeks later, just days after Mugabe won a majority of votes in a runoff denounced as a ""sham"" by the international community.  Watch how violence persists after the election » . Like the Etheredges, Mike and Angela Campbell were warned that Mugabe loyalists, members of his Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front, were planning to invade their farm. The government had given the 1,200-hectare (2,965-acre) tract to a Zanu-PF spokesman who also served as Mugabe's biographer, according to the Campbells' son-in-law, Ben Freeth. Two nuns went to Mount Carmel on June 26, the day before the runoff, wanting to buy sweet potatoes, Freeth said. But their quest for tubers was a ruse; they actually wanted to tell Freeth that Zanu-PF members were planning to raid the Campbell land, where the Campbells and Freeth and his wife, Laura, live. On June 29, Freeth received a phone call: ""War veterans,"" as the clans of pro-Mugabe thugs call themselves, were heading to his in-laws' house. Laura and her brother, Bruce, gathered their children. Laura fled with the children through a fence on the northern boundary of Mount Carmel farm, Freeth said. Freeth jumped in his car and sped 1½ kilometers to the Campbell house. ""These guys had already arrived, and they started shooting at me as soon as I drove through the gate,"" he said. The bullets missed, but one of the war veterans hurled a rock through the driver's side window, smashing Freeth's right eye shut. ""They dragged me out of the vehicle and began beating me over the head with rifle butts,"" Freeth said. The men tied up Freeth, he said, and took him to where his in-laws were lying bound on the gravel outside their home. Angela Campbell was still conscious. The men had caught her on her way to feed a calf. They had beaten her and broken her upper arm in two places, Freeth said. Mike Campbell was in bad shape, ""just groaning on the ground; in fact, he remembers nothing."" The heavily armed men threw the three in the back of Mike Campbell's Toyota Prado truck, and ""the next nine hours were quite a nightmare,"" Freeth said. Freeth and the Campbells were driven about 50 kilometers (31 miles) to Pickstone Mine. Their captors stopped at a dairy farm on the way and killed a white farmer's dogs, Freeth said. Night had fallen by the time they arrived at the mine to find about 60 men in Zanu-PF regalia waiting for them. ""They were pointing guns at us the whole time, telling us they were going to kill us,"" Freeth said. Freeth and the Campbells were doused with cold water and left ""shivering in the dust on the ground,"" Freeth said. They received more beatings, and Freeth said one of their captors thrashed the bottom of his feet with a shambock, a whip made of hippopotamus hide. It was during this time that their captors made Angela sign a document promising to drop the case scheduled this week before the tribunal. Mike Campbell moved in and out of consciousness, as Ben and Angela prayed -- not for their lives, but for their captors. Freeth said he had never understood Luke 6:28 -- ""Bless those who curse you"" -- until that moment, and a ""supernatural"" peace came over him. Freeth told God, ""If I'm going to be with you today, then I'm ready."" It was almost midnight when Freeth and the Campbells -- still bound -- were tossed in the back of the Prado. They bounced around the sport-utility vehicle as their captors drove 30 kilometers down a craggy dirt road to Kadoma, where they were dumped in the streets. ""I managed to walk toward a light and knocked on the door of a house and used the phone to phone my wife,"" Freeth said. The Campbells were released from the hospital last week. Both remain weak and still bear considerable scrapes and bruises. Angela has a pin in her arm. Mike, 75, suffered four broken ribs, a broken collarbone and a dislocated finger. Mike is recovering just enough to sit up, and ""he can walk a few paces,"" Freeth said Monday, complaining that his hands were ""still tingly"" from being bound so tightly. The hospital released Freeth at the weekend after neurosurgeons had to drill a 4-centimeter (1½-inch) hole in his skull to relieve pressure from a hematoma stemming from the rock and rifle-butt blows to the head. One thing not battered is the farmers' resolve to remain on the land that the Campbells have owned for 34 years. ""We intend to be there on Wednesday, and we just hope for an outcome that is good for everyone, an outcome for justice,"" Freeth said of the hearing, which is slated to last through Friday. Freeth said he believes that the tribunal will carry more clout with Mugabe than do Western nations and the African and European unions. Many of its member nations are led by Mugabe's contemporaries, and Mugabe is aware that his status as an African hero is waning, he said. ""I think it means a lot to him whether SADC is going to isolate him or continue to support him,"" Freeth said. ""Once we get to the SADC tribunal and we get a judgment and it's basically binding in black and white, it's going to be difficult for Mugabe to say, 'We're abiding by our own law.' It's going to be very difficult for him to defend what he's doing.""","Farmers kidnapped, beaten days after election for challenging land confiscation .

"(CNN) -- One of seven suspects charged with murder in the deaths of a Florida couple will be extradited from Alabama to Florida to stand trial, authorities said Monday. Donald Stallworth Jr. will plead not guilty to the slayings, his lawyer says. A warrant for Donald Stallworth Jr.'s extradition has been processed by governors' offices in Florida and Alabama and sent to the jail where he is being housed, Florida State Attorney Bill Eddins said. ""At this time, he is ready to be transported back to Escambia County, Florida, to face double murder charges and home invasion robbery,"" the statement said, adding Stallworth would be transported ""in the very near future."" Stallworth faces charges in connection with the shooting deaths of Byrd and Melanie Billings on July 8. He is one of seven suspects charged with murder; an eighth person has been charged with being an accessory after the fact. Authorities have said the Billingses, who were known for adopting special-needs children, were killed during a home invasion robbery in Beulah, Florida. A small safe containing prescription medication, family documents and some jewelry was taken, and later found in the backyard of the eighth suspect, Pamela Wiggins, authorities have said. Two sources familiar with the investigation have told CNN that a second safe at the home contained at least $100,000. Police have described another suspect, Leonard Patrick Gonzalez Jr., as the organizer of the crime. Escambia County Sheriff David Morgan has said Gonzalez once worked for a car dealership Byrd Billings owned, and court documents state that Gonzalez received financial support from the family for a martial-arts studio he ran. An attorney representing the Billingses has said that Byrd Billings made a nominal donation to Gonzalez's karate charity. Stallworth's attorney, David White, said last week that his client would plead not guilty. The evidence against Stallworth is based solely on the word of another suspect who said he was at the crime scene, White said. It was not clear to which suspect White was referring. CNN's Aaron Cooper and Ross Levitt contributed to this report.","Donald Stallworth Jr. is one of 7 suspects in slayings of Byrd and Melanie Billings .

"(CNN) -- Think of the Arab souk -- the fabled marketplaces of the Middle East -- and it immediately conjures up images straight from the Arabian Nights: mountains of yellow turmeric, shafts of light through lattices and the air thick with incense smoke. These powerful associations have not been lost on the team from the United Arab Emirates that last month won the bid to host the World Expo 2020; exhibitors making the journey to Dubai in seven years will be setting up their pavilions in the biggest souk in history. The 438-hectare site at the Dubai Trade Center, Jebel Ali, will be one of the largest ever developed for a World Expo. Created in an empty desert area between Dubai and Abu Dhabi, the vast zones of the structure -- each one representing the bid themes of sustainability, mobility and opportunity - are inspired by the labyrinthine galleries of the souk. At the core of the site will be an open plaza called Al Wasl --Arabic for ""the connection"" -- to fit with the Expo theme of ""Connecting Minds, Creating the Future."" Certainly in terms of Expo history, Dubai has a tough act to follow. Previous Expos have famously given the world the Eiffel Tower and unveiled products as important as the telephone and as ubiquitous as Heinz Tomato Ketchup . For Greg Lindsay, co-author of ""Aerotropolis: The Way We'll Live Next"", the Expo proximity to the new Al-Maktoum International Airport and Dubai World Central development is especially significant. ""(Dubai World Central) is the best organic example of an 'aerotropolis,'"" says Lindsay, whose book puts the case that modern globalized cities such as Dubai are built around, and feed off, airports in much the same way as cities in the 19th century were built around the railways. ""In 1990, there was nothing really there ... it was the strategy of Emirates and the civil aviation authority to make Dubai the crossroads of the world. ""I do think winning the Expo will be a huge catalyst for its development,"" he said. Hub for a new Silk Road . What can be said of Dubai World Central also holds for much of Dubai too. A generation ago, it was just a modest regional entrepot. Today its strategic position between East and West has made it one of the world's key hubs in the globalized economy. According to Afshin Molavi, a global geo-economics specialist and senior advisor at Oxford Analytica, Chinese businesses use Dubai as a hub for Africa, Indian traders use the city to access markets across the world and Western multinationals see Dubai as a hub for the Middle East. ""Dubai sits at the intersection of one of the most transformative moments in geo-economic history in more than a century: the gradual but inexorable shift of the economic center of gravity from the West to emerging markets and the rise of the so-called ""South-South"" trade,"" Molavi said. ""I would argue that Dubai and the UAE stand at the center of 'The New Silk Road' of trade between the Middle East and Asia, and also what HSBC calls 'The Southern Silk Road' linking Latin America, Africa, and Asia in a new world of trade."" Read more: Middle East's big aviation ambitions . By the year 2020, economists estimate emerging markets will account for roughly half of global GDP, a dramatic leap from just 15% in the 1980s. In terms of air traffic alone, Dubai 's importance as a hub cannot be underestimated. Just four hours' flight from key cities in both Europe and Asia, there are now more flights from India to Dubai than anywhere else in the world and, in the other directions, more than 300 flights weekly from Dubai to India. Inflating property bubbles? Despite its position at the center of a region undergoing massive change, the successful Expo bid has raised concerns that Dubai may become a victim of its own success. Regional instability combined with rapid development has led to one of the world's most volatile property markets. Already a magnet for the super-rich, real estate prices are now underpinned by Syrian, Libyan and Egyptian investors sitting out political troubles at home. According to property analysts, prices have already surged 20% since last year and rents in some neighborhoods are up by 40%. Read more: Oxford, Yale or Abu Dhabi? Dubai estimates its successful Expo 2020 bid will generate US$23 billion, or 24% of the city's GDP, between 2015 and 2021. With memories still fresh of the bust in 2008 when property prices were slashed by 50% and Dubai had to be bailed out by Abu Dhabi to the tune of US$10 billion, some fear that another massive correction is on the way. Faris Mansour, director of Mubadala Pramerica Real Estate Investors, told the Cityscape Global conference in Dubai recently that the city should brace for another fall. ""The (investment) capital is temporary and can quickly move out,"" Mansour warned. ""And that's not to say it will fall necessarily as it did before. But it will fall, it will correct and this is something we should all expect to happen and I expect it to happen in the next 18 to 24 months... as capital becomes more expensive globally."" Despite the dire warning, many believe the Expo -- far from creating a bubble - will underpin property prices for many years to come in a city that recovered from the crisis in 2008 faster than anyone expected. For Molavi, Dubai's real economic resource lies in its people and its position at the crossroads of the world. ""Dubai might be one of the most hyper-connected places on the planet,"" he said. ""You can see it on the streets and in the malls. There are not many places where you can mingle with more than 200 different nationalities.""","Dubai won the bid to host World Expo 2020 .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A controversial assertion by convicted Robert F. Kennedy assassin Sirhan Sirhan to win his freedom was challenged this week by the California attorney general who said ""overwhelming evidence"" exists against Sirhan's claims. Sirhan's attorneys have said that a second gunman actually assassinated Kennedy in 1968 and that Sirhan was hypno-programmed to fire a gun as a diversion. ""In sum, (Sirhan) cannot possibly show that no reasonable juror would have convicted him if a jury had considered his 'new' evidence and allegations, in light of the overwhelming evidence supporting the convictions and the available evidence thoroughly debunking (Sirhan's) second-shooter and automaton theories,"" Attorney General Kamala Harris said in federal court papers filed this week. Sirhan, the sole person convicted of killing Kennedy, is seeking a new trial or freedom from his life sentence based on ""formidable evidence"" asserting his innocence and ""horrendous violations"" of his rights, defense attorneys said in federal court papers filed last year. Harris, who is asking a federal court in Los Angeles to dismiss Sirhan's request, conceded in court papers filed Wednesday that his lawyers may be able to show two guns were involved in Kennedy's assassination. Kennedy was seeking the Democratic presidential nomination when he was killed. But even if Sirhan's lawyers can show 13 shots were fired in the Kennedy shooting, Sirhan shouldn't be released from prison, Harris said. ""The mere possibility that more than one firearm was discharged during the assassination does not dismantle the prosecution's case"" against Sirhan, the attorney general said in the latest court documents. Harris said Sirhan is relying on acoustic expert Philip Van Praag's analysis of a tape recording of the Kennedy shooting that concludes 13 shots were fired during the murder and ""demonstrates the existence of a second shooter because (Sirhan) only fired eight shots."" The attorney general argues that even if there were a second gunman involved in the Kennedy shooting, Sirhan hasn't proven his innocence. Sirhan ""at most has shown that, according to Van Praag, two guns could be heard firing 13 shots in an audiotape of the shooting,"" Harris said. Authorities have said eight bullets were fired in the kitchen pantry of the former Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, with three bullets hitting Kennedy's body, a fourth passing harmlessly through his suit coat and the rest striking five other victims, who survived. Kennedy, younger brother of the assassinated U.S. President John F. Kennedy, was shot shortly after midnight on June 5, 1968, only moments after the presidential candidate had claimed victory in California's Democratic primary election. He died the next day. Defense lawyers William F. Pepper and Laurie D. Dusek say Van Praag's analysis of the tape recording shows two guns fired 13 shots -- five more gunshots than Sirhan could have fired from his eight-shot revolver. Sirhan had no opportunity to reload his gun in the pantry. Harris calls Van Praag's analysis ""pure speculation."" The recording of the Kennedy shooting was made by freelance reporter Stanislaw Pruszynski. ABC News television videotape of the hotel ballroom, where the senator had just claimed victory in the California primary, shows Pruszynski holding his recording equipment in his left hand while descending a small set of ballroom steps, approximately 40 feet away from the kitchen pantry shooting, and moving towards the pantry during the period when the shots were being fired there, off-camera. Harris said that even if it could be proven ""that a second gunman successfully shot Senator Kennedy, (Sirhan) would still be guilty of the charged crimes."" She said that under California's vicarious liability law, ""an aider and abettor 'is guilty not only of the offense he intended to facilitate or encourage, but also of any reasonably foreseeable offense committed by the person he aids and abets'."" The defense argues Sirhan did not knowingly fire at Kennedy but thought he was shooting at circular targets on a firing range. They contend Sirhan was a victim of hypno-programming by conspirators who programmed him to fire shots as a diversion for the senator's real killer. For his hypo-programming defense, Sirhan is relying on Daniel Brown, an associate clinical professor in psychology at Harvard Medical School who has interviewed Sirhan for 60 hours over a three-year period, according to defense attorneys. But the attorney general rejected the hypno-programming claim. ""The theory that a person could be hypnotized into planning and committing a murder against his will is a controversial (if not fantastic) one and has not been adopted by most of Brown's peers, including the American Psychological Association,"" Harris wrote. ""Thus, even if (Sirhan) could show that some psychologists believe in mind control or hypno-programming, his showing of actual innocence is nevertheless based on a debatable theory that is not universally accepted in the psychology community,"" Harris said. Sirhan, who turns 68 next month, was denied parole at a hearing last year where he once again claimed to have no memory of the Kennedy shooting, an assertion Sirhan has maintained since 1968.","Convicted assassin Sirhan Sirhan asserts a second gunman killed Robert F.

"(CNN) -- A sharply taken goal was followed by a celebration which showed he also has a sense of humor. Samuel Eto'o scored the crucial opener in Chelsea's 4-0 rout of Tottenham Hotspur Saturday to take them seven points clear in the English Premier League -- then faked as if he was an old man with a bad back, using the corner flag as a walking stick. Maybe it was in reaction to his manager Jose Mourinho's unguarded comments to a French TV channel last month. The Portuguese apparently questioned the age of the Cameroon star, who is 33 later this week, as well as making unflattering reference to the other strikers at Chelsea. Perhaps it has acted as unintentional motivation, but Eto'o showed his old qualities as he latched on to Jan Vertonghen's clumsy back pass and calmly beat Hugo Lloris to put Chelsea ahead just after half time. Moments later Eto'o raced on to Eden Hazard's through ball and went quickly to ground under challenge from Younes Kaboul. Referee Michael Oliver pointed to the spot and compounded Tottenham's anger by sending off Kaboul. Hazard converted from the spot and Eto'o's work was essentially done, being replaced by Demba Ba, but earning a pat on the back from Mourinho. He had only earned his place in the starting line up when Fernando Torres injured himself in the warm-up and Mourinho told Sky Sports, that it was ""fate"" that he later scored his seventh EPL goal of the season. ""I think he's amazing. The way he copes with the situation in the last couple of weeks, I think he's fantastic. And today I told him before the game: 'You are going to score for sure.'"" Tottenham's part in their own downfall, looking comfortable until Vertonghen's disastrous error after a slip, was summed up by Chelsea's two late goals. Sandro also slipped to allow Ba to score a rare EPL goal this term and he doubled his tally and made it 4-0 after he intercepted Kyle Walker's careless header. Tottenham manager Tim Sherwood was left shaking his head in disbelief, Mourinho had a spring in his step after a victory which left them clear of second-placed Liverpool and nine points ahead of Manchester City, who have three games in hand. Sherwood launched a post-match tirade against his team, whose chances of Champions League football have all but disappeared. ""You can't legislate for the capitulation -- you can't have that. Lack of characters, too many of them too nice to each other and you need to show a bit more guts and not want to be someone's mate all the time,"" he said. ""It hurts me and I won't forget about this when we hit the motorway, but some might,"" he added. Earlier, Manchester United kept their slim hopes of Champions League qualification alive with a 3-0 win over West Bromwich Albion at the Hawthorns. Goals from Phil Jones, Wayne Rooney and Danny Welbeck gave United a second straight league win, while Pepe Mel's WBA remained a point above the drop zone after the home defeat. ""I thought our forward play was very good,"" under-pressure United manager David Moyes told BT Sport. Third-placed Arsenal were involved in FA Cup quarterfinal action Saturday and beat Everton 4-1 at the Emirates to book a last four match at Wembley. The match hinged on the award of a penalty to the home side in the second half with the scores tied at 1-1. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was tripped by Gareth Barry and Mikel Arteta converted from the spot. Olivier Giroud came off the bench for the home side to add gloss to the scoreline with two late goals as Everton pushed for an equalizer. Mesut Ozil had put Arsenal ahead before Romelu Lukaku leveled for the visitors.","Chelsea stretch lead at top of English Premier League .

"(CNN) -- Months after Comair Flight 5191's deadly accident in Lexington, Kentucky, in 2006, I continued to look through the thousands of pages of official evidence to understand what happened. Although this was my fifth airline accident investigation, no matter how many times I examined the documents, there simply was no egregious act leading up to the disaster's key event: The airliner took off from the wrong runway. Then it dawned on me -- and shook me to my core. As a captain flying the same type of aircraft in and out of the same airport, I could have had the same takeoff accident. This could have been me. This was not some troubled crew, but one that had been praised for their safety standards and passion for flying. While pouring over the accident ""facts,"" I could not help but notice how normal everything seemed early that morning. The documents painted the picture. This looked like any other morning I had experienced as an airline pilot. But yet, something was terribly wrong, we had just suffered the worst U.S. airline accident in five years and 49 passengers and crew were dead. How would we ever put our finger on one item and identify it as the factor with which in its absence the accident would not have occurred? How do we establish this one component as being more important in causation as compared to the others discovered? And in the United States we do this even if the evidence still does not support it. We do it because we have to, and the federal organization that investigates plane crashes, the National Transportation Safety Board, has no choice. At least right now. When NTSB investigators are finished walking through the rubble and sifting through the broken parts, they analyze the results and offer up what -- for some people -- are palatable answers. These answers might include phrases such as ""He failed to do this..."" or ""She did not follow a procedure,"" explanations that strip away the confusion and reveal a supposed weak link in an otherwise robust transportation system. These explanations satisfy our desire to understand how order can become disorder so quickly. These single cause explanations unfortunately read like who is to blame. When the NTSB was created by Congress more than 40 years ago, lawmakers ordered them not to assign blame. But Congress did command the NTSB to find a probable cause. However, using single, narrow explanations -- with qualifiers such as ""failed to"" or ""did not"" when aimed at a single incident or person -- does just that. Single explanations fall short of answering a larger, perhaps more important question: Why? Why did ""he fail to do this?"" Or ""Why did she not follow procedure"" This is where the true lever for change firmly rests. The missed opportunity to truly understand the complexity of these events. As seen in the recent hearings surrounding last year's crash landing of Asiana Flight 214, the complexity is evident and is painfully clear that you cannot choose one thing to stand above the rest. You cannot say that one item of interest was the most important at the expense of other causal roles taking a backseat. Maybe some are more central to the final act moments to the event, but there is no metric for determining which event is the one that goes to the top of the list and everything takes a lesser role. Why are we so convinced that we can? In fact, sizable research into these events shows that it is simply wasted energy to try to do so. Why are we so focused on trying to find that one elusive smoking gun when it is never really there? This is why many countries no longer try. The United States is one of the last industrialized nations that still tries to find a single cause to these complex transportation accidents. This is an impossible task left over from an outdated congressional mandate that has caused the United States to lag behind in accident investigation. For example, in Canada, the Transport Safety Board has done away with causal statements altogether. Instead, it lists its findings and recommendations -- thus avoiding an artificially narrow focus on blaming a few things or people. It recognizes as do many other countries that it is a futile effort. After an accident last year, Canada's TSB chair Wendy Tadros reported: ""We hold by the theory that no accident is ever caused by one thing. It's always a series of things, and it always involves an organization and how they operate. We need to look deeply into that. It never comes down to one individual."" She is right. Years ago when our congressional mandate was written, investigative methods were still in their infancy. Additionally, over the past 20 years, increased regulatory oversight, improved engineering methods and better procedures to name a few have helped reduce the number of deadly airline accidents to its lowest in history. Single factors by themselves do not ""cause"" safety. Why would a single factor also be responsible for an accident? So why do we continue to offer explanations to the traveling public at the expense of improving the larger system? Do we really believe that a single human decision could topple a safe transportation system? Fourteen years ago, a Rand Study of the NTSB titled ""Safety in the Skies"" specifically addressed the issue of single, probable cause. One recommendation said, ""the NTSB should move away from simplistic, one-line probable cause statements, and instead consistently adopt a comprehensive statement that reflects the reality that a modern aircraft accident is rarely the result of a single error or failure."" After the Comair accident, then-NTSB board member Deborah Hersman, who is the current NTSB chairman, stated the same concern in a statement at the end of the accident report. ""I do suggest that the Safety Board should explore other approaches to determining probable cause or causes as a way to refine our approach and if necessary, ask Congress to grant us the statutory relief needed to structure our probable cause findings to be more comprehensive."" It's an idea that has been sitting around longer than the Rand report. What are we waiting for? Do we think these accidents will become less complex with time, or that our systems are so brittle that despite safeguards and resilience they will collapse with a single inevitable human error? Of course not. Then why do we still try to find the one item that did? I think the traveling American public deserves the same breadth of investigative findings that other world citizens are offered. If we hope to improve upon the currently stalled accident rate, we must -- like the rest of the world -- move beyond artificially narrowed construction of causation statements and truly see the events before us as they are instead of forcing them into an outdated congressional mandate of single cause.

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- President Barack Obama's strategy for the Ukraine crisis reflects his internationalist foreign policy while adhering to the age-old maxim that money talks. He sent Secretary of State John Kerry to Kiev on Tuesday to forcefully condemn Russia for seizing effective military control of the Crimea region. At the same time, Kerry announced $1 billion in loan guarantees to help insulate the Ukrainian economy from the effects of reduced energy subsidies from Russia. It all is part of the still simmering breakup of the old Soviet Union more than two decades ago, with Russian President Vladimir Putin seeking to maintain Russia's influence and economic ties in a region being wooed by the European Union and Washington for increased trade and other links. On Tuesday, both Obama and Kerry warned Putin of possible international sanctions and other steps to isolate Russia diplomatically and economically if he escalates the Ukraine crisis by sending in more troops. The goal of such an approach would be to hit Putin where it hurts by weakening the ruble and Russia's economy while avoiding the possibility of igniting an already volatile crisis to a new level of confrontation and possible violence. Isolation, not confrontation, is the goal . ""It is diplomacy and respect for sovereignty, not unilateral force, that can best solve disputes like this in the 21st century,"" Kerry told reporters to wrap up his one-day stop in Ukraine's capital. ""President Obama and I want to make it clear to Russia and to everybody in the world that we are not seeking confrontation."" However, he continued, ""if Russia does not choose to de-escalate, if it is not willing to work directly with the government of Ukraine, as we hope they will be, then our partners will have absolutely no choice but to join us to continue to expand upon steps we have taken in recent days in order to isolate Russia politically, diplomatically and economically."" What are U.S. options? One possible move, hinted at by Kerry, would be to kick Russia out of the G8 group of industrial powers that also includes the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Canada. Those nations already are skipping a preparatory meeting for the next G8 summit set to be hosted by Putin in June in Sochi. ""It is not appropriate to invade a country and, at the end of a barrel of a gun, dictate what you are trying to achieve,"" Kerry said. ""That is not 21st century G8, major nation behavior."" The United States ""will stand by the Ukrainian people,"" he said after accusing Russia of making up reasons for further military intervention in Ukraine based on alleged persecution of Russian speakers and native Russians. ""Not a single piece of credible evidence supports any one of these claims,"" he said, adding that it was clear ""that Russia has been working hard to create a pretext to invade further."" Told by a reporter that Putin had earlier indicated no Russian troops were in Crimea, Kerry shook his head with disbelief and asked: ""He really denied there were troops in Crimea?"" Putin decision near? A U.S. official familiar with the latest administration assessment said Tuesday that national security agencies believe Putin will decide in the next few days whether to send more troops into Ukraine. According to the official, the diplomatic pressure by Obama and Kerry sought to influence Putin's decision. In remarks Tuesday, Obama said Putin realized that the United States and its European allies consider the Russian military buildup in Ukraine a violation of international law. ""There have been some reports that President Putin is pausing for a moment and reflecting on what's happened,"" Obama said. ""I know President Putin seems to have a different set of lawyers making a different set of interpretations but I don't think that's fooling anybody,"" Obama continued. ""I think everybody recognizes that although Russia has legitimate interests in what happens in a neighboring state, that does not give it the right to use force as a means of exerting influence inside of that state."" U.S. moving fast on possible sanctions . In another sign of increasing pressure on Putin, a Chinese government statement Tuesday quoted President Xi Jinping as calling for a diplomatic solution. ""The situation is highly complicated and sensitive, affecting both regional and entire global situations,"" said the statement attributed to Xi. ""I believe Russia can coordinate with all sides, use political means to resolve the issue, and maintain peace and stability for the region and the world. China supports conciliatory measures from the international community that help mitigate the situation."" Critics want a more robust U.S. response . No one calls for a U.S. military response in Ukraine, and polls show strong public opposition to the United States assuming the role of global policeman by taking the lead in international conflicts. During his presidency, Obama has sought a more international approach to crises, as exemplified by the NATO coalition that imposed a ""no-fly"" zone on Libya with logistical help from the United States. However, his inability to build an international coalition to attack Syria for its use of chemical weapons resulted in criticism that Obama failed to fulfill his earlier threat to act. Hawkish U.S. politicians want a more robust response by the Obama administration to the Russian aggression, calling for tough economic sanctions and reviving plans to build a missile-defense shield in Poland that Putin opposed. Republican Rep. Ed Royce of California, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, called for pursuing aggressive sanctions that would undermine the ruble and Russia's state-owned banks. ""We should do it, frankly,"" he told CNN, but adding that Russia should be offered an ""exit ramp"" out of the crisis through negotiations. Jim Walsh, an international security analyst with the MIT Security Studies Program, told CNN that any sanctions must be in concert with European allies to be effective. So far, Walsh noted, there has been little sign of support from key allies Britain and Germany for tough economic sanctions against Russia. Meanwhile, House Speaker John Boehner called for Obama to speed up government approval of U.S. natural gas exports to the Ukraine. ""We should not force our allies to remain dependent on Putin for their energy needs,"" Boehner said, describing the current approval process as a ""de facto ban."" ""Expediting approval of natural gas exports is one clear step the U.S. can take to stand by our allies and stand up to Russian aggression, while creating American jobs at the same time,"" he said. Putin: Russia has no plans to annex Crimea . To Obama and his supporters pursuing what they consider to be a 21st Century world order, the Russian military moves would arouse the suspicions of other countries in the region. ""If anything, it will push many countries further away from Russia,"" Obama said. ""There is the ability for Ukraine to be a friend of the West and a friend of Russia's as long as none of us are in Ukraine trying to meddle and intervene, certainly not militarily, with decisions that properly belong to the Ukrainian people."" Loan guarantees . The loan guarantees announced Tuesday will help Ukraine move forward with an assistance package from the International Monetary Fund, which is calling for the country to raise energy prices. Obama administration officials traveling with Kerry said Treasury Department technical advisers would travel to Ukraine to help its national bank and finance ministry deal with economic challenges and implement energy sector reforms. The United States also will train observers for the May 25 elections, and is sending a team of experts to help identify stolen assets and support anti-corruption measures. With Ukraine looking to reduce dependence on Russian energy, the United States also will provide assistance and financing to help businesses find new export markets and will offer technical advice to the government on Ukraine's World Trade Organization rights with respect to Russia. Obama and Kerry both urged Russia to pull its forces back into their barracks and agree to international observers in Ukraine to monitor the situation. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, a regional security bloc, sent in 10 monitors Monday, and Kerry called for a larger mission. ""These are the people who could actually identify legitimate threats, and we are asking, together with the government of Ukraine, together with the European community, for large numbers of observers to be able to come in here and monitor the situation and be the arbiters of truth versus fiction,"" he said, alluding to the Russian claims of persecution.

"(CNN) -- Mayor Rahm Emanuel is not creating two cities, despite Kevin Coval's view in a recent opinion piece about the series ""Chicagoland"" that's airing on CNN. There have been two cities here for a very long time. In fact, Chicago differs very little from other major metropolises in the United States in demonstrating the disturbing and growing gulf between the wealthy and the poor. Emanuel is no more the creator of that problem than Coval is the creator of a tradition of fighting it. This is the city of Jane Addams and Studs Terkel. This is the city of the Haymarket riots. This is a city with a long heritage of leaders and fighters, people who found new ways to bridge the divides in an effort to dismantle a corrupt and unfair system. This is not about an individual. This is about a broken system and the best ways to try to repair it and its ill effects. Many of those leaders hailed from the privileged class, using their disproportionate cultural and economic resources to fuel their fight. (I flatter Kevin and me by placing us within that group.) On the night when Emanuel was found on a swing rather than at poetry readings by Englewood youth, he was participating in another well-established and problematic tradition: soliciting money from the wealthy to support social causes unsupportable through the political system. Specifically, Emanuel was lending his cultural clout to my organization, Redmoon Theater, and its efforts to create free public programming in some of Chicago's most underserved areas. He was lending his support to The Great Chicago Fire Festival, a new signature event for Chicago that seeks to create a platform for underheard voices and overlooked stories. More pointedly still, rather than meet the Young Chicago Authors poets from the Englewood neighborhood, Emanuel was in another neighborhood, Pilsen, helping to raise money for a Redmoon event, which features Young Chicago Authors as a core partner. Take last summer, when Redmoon and Young Chicago Authors partnered to create public poetry and drumming events in a dozen overlooked and neglected public parks. This effort, too, demands private fundraising. Put the mayor on a swing, sit him on a platform and serve him expensive treats, drag him from this group to that for a photograph. Like walking around patting young black kids on the head, as Coval says he does in Episode 4 of ""Chicagoland."" This is part of the job. As he wrote in the opinion piece, Emanuel is not an educator or a mentor. He is a career politician, and this is his work: stumping for causes. Emanuel has been in office less than three years. He inherited immense budget problems featuring an unimaginable pension debt. He walked into a long history of social and cultural neglect, to say nothing of our flailing national economy that is exaggerating already untenable economic disparity. He is also a lifetime politician in a system that is utterly broken, where the only way to get into a position of political power depends on a preternatural capacity to raise money. Let's not oversimplify the problem or demonize some single person as its symbolic head, as though we could lop it off and send the problem to a hasty end. These are complex problems with complex solutions that demand collective and productive engagement. The first step may well be forming unexpected coalitions, such as artists and the politicians whose job it is to represent them, their interests and those who want to hear from them. I'm all in.","Jim Lasko differs with opinion piece blaming Mayor Rahm Emanuel for division in Chicago .

"MOSCOW, Russia -- Russia declared an end Thursday to its 10-year anti-terror ""operation"" in the autonomous republic of Chechnya. Russian forces have been operating in Chechnya since Boris Yeltsin's order in 1999.

"(CNN) -- U.S.-Russian ties may be at their frostiest since the height of the Cold War, but at least there's some warmth to the relationship between U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. As Vladimir Putin and Barack Obama struggle to maintain even a modicum of cordiality, sparring over everything from Ukraine and Syria to fugitive NSA leaker Edward Snowden, their top diplomats have developed a rapport that observers say could be key to resolving an array of differences on some of the world's biggest geopolitical crises. At first glance, the two men would seem to have very little in common. Kerry, 70, is a career politician who served nearly three decades in the U.S. Senate and is known for his sense of humor and propensity for going off-script during talks. Lavrov, 64, is a career diplomat who has spent more than 40 years as a Russian envoy in posts around the world, and has been nicknamed ""Minister No"" for his tough, by-the-book approach to negotiations. But both men are from the same generation, and observers say they have developed a mutual respect for one another over a series of face-to-face meetings since Kerry took the job in February last year. ""It seems both Kerry and Lavrov prefer the old school, they do it with grace,"" says one Moscow-based analyst who declined to be named in this report. ""It looks like they've developed a pretty good rapport, and this is a stark difference from when Lavrov's partners were Condoleezza Rice and Hillary Clinton."" Lavrov and Rice, who was appointed Secretary of State by George W. Bush, locked horns numerous times during her tenure. One Washington Post reporter said Lavrov was known for pushing Rice's buttons, writing that the Russian had ""perfected the art of irritating Rice"" in meetings. Clinton and Lavrov were all smiles when the former first lady famously handed him a plastic red ""reset"" button in 2009. But the reset didn't last. After Clinton branded Russia's decision in 2012 to block a U.N. resolution on Syria a ""travesty,"" Lavrov said Western criticism of his Russia's approach was ""on the verge of hysteria."" Lavrov and Kerry have managed to conjure up a dÃ©tente of sorts over the past year. Lavrov's English is excellent, and both men speak French. Lavrov often joins Kerry to talk policy on his frequent garden strolls during face-to-face meetings, and last month the pair were photographed kicking a soccer ball around the grounds of the U.S. ambassador's house in London. Both are reportedly avid sports fans -- Kerry played varsity soccer at Yale University, while Lavrov is a die-hard fan of Moscow club FC Spartak. And in January, Kerry surprised Lavrov with a gift of two giant Idaho potatoes during a meeting in Paris. Kerry said that his friend had mentioned the spuds during a conversation over Christmas. Not to be outdone, the Russian gave State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki a pink ""ushanka"" hat to help her keep ""warm and fancy"" during the winter storms in the U.S. But it is their professionalism, not personal interests, that really makes the relationship work, according to Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center. ""Presidents Putin and Obama do not get along very well,"" Trenin says. ""There's always a personal element about all those relationships, and normally it helps. [Kerry and Lavrov] may share an interest in some outside issues, but what really makes that relationship work is that the two men are really good professionals."" They've also showed a willingness to keep picking up the phone, and managed to strike a deal on eliminating Syria's chemical weapons stockpile last September. And the pair shared a lighter moment at the end of their joint press conference, when Kerry was unable to hear the end of Lavrov's translated remarks. ""It was okay John, don't worry,"" Lavrov assured him, to laughs from reporters. A smiling Kerry replied, ""You want me to take your word for it? It's a little early for that."" Ukraine is arguably an even tougher diplomatic challenge, pitching the U.S. and Russia against each other first in Kiev, then Crimea and now in the country's restive east, where pro-Russian protesters have seized government buildings in several cities in the past several weeks. Kerry has accused Russia of fomenting unrest to destabilize Ukraine's new, West-leaning government. In return, Lavrov has accused the West of meddling in Ukrainian affairs. While Kerry sometimes appears to go beyond the White House's script during crisis talks, Lavrov consistently offers a faithful translation of Putin's foreign policy, according to observers -- one that the West can sometimes find difficult to interpret. ""'The president mainly speaks to the Russian people. His audience, his constituency is mainly the audience of the Russian federation. The foreign minister talks to his colleagues in other governments [and] couches his phrases in diplomatic speak,"" says Carnegie's Dmitri Trenin. ""I see no significant daylight between what Vladimir Putin has said and what Sergei Lavrov says."" Russia says it wants Ukraine to set up a federal system in which regions with ethnic Russian majorities would have more autonomy. The U.S. says it fears that unrest in the country's east could be used by Russia as a pretext for military intervention. As the U.S. and Russia join the EU and Ukraine for four-way talks aimed at defusing the Ukrainian crisis, experts hope Kerry and Lavrov's close working relationship will enable them to take the edge off what are expected to be contentious proceedings. ""The situation now is very, very tense and very dangerous,"" says the Moscow-based analyst who declined to be named in this report. ""But the fact that Lavrov and Kerry talk so often is a very positive sign. They can agree and disagree on certain issues, but this personal relationship helps a little bit.""

"(CNN) -- The choice of mobile as the medium for CNN's Africa-wide survey of Mandela-related opinion shows how much has changed across the continent in the two decades between Mandela's presidency, and his death. Imagine attempting to do a phone survey in 1994, when a country like Nigeria -- Africa's most populous -- had fewer than half-a-million landlines for its more than 100 million people, and mobile phones were mostly unheard of. (At this time of course land-lines were a staple across the developed world.) The dire state of technology was of course a reflection of wider -- political -- dysfunction. While multi-party democracy was taking root in South Africa, only about five of Africa's 54 countries were not being ruled by dictators, most of whom did little more than loot the treasury and kill everyone perceived to be an enemy. Indeed the circumstances of most African countries shared nothing in common with the peace and reconciliation and prospects of prosperity that the election of Nelson Mandela symbolized in 1994. 1994 was the year that Robert Kaplan's dystopian essay, ""The Coming Anarchy,"" appeared in the Atlantic Monthly. In it Kaplan wrote: '""West Africa is reverting to the Africa of the Victorian Atlas. It consists now of a series of coastal trading posts, such as Freetown and Conakry, and an interior that, owing to violence, volatility and disease, is again becoming, as Graham Greene once observed, 'blank' and 'unexplored'."" 1994 was also the year that Rwanda fell apart -- almost a million people hacked to death in a matter of months. Fast forward to 2013, and a lot has changed. A semblance of democracy has taken root in most of those places that were once a byword for anarchy. Many of those wars have ended, and the same continent in which negative economic growth was a badge of honor now boasts of more countries on the list of fastest-growing economies in the world than any other. Where once the continent was defined by its AK-47s -- the Economist's famous Hopeless Continent cover in 2000 featured a child soldier clutching a rifle -- it is now more likely to be defined by those mobile phones that have made this survey possible. Perhaps it is then easy to see why the majority of respondents in the survey -- 64 percent -- are more optimistic about the future than they were when Mandela became President in 1994. Then again it's important to note that only a tenth of the surveyed population is older than 30. Which means that most were not even teenagers yet when Mandela became President. And you should know that across the world, the Millennial generation (as those born post-1980 are known), armed with their mobile phones and social networking, seem to be an unshakably optimistic lot. Why that is so, is up for debate -- there are any number of articles on the Internet asking the question: ""Why are Millennials so optimistic?"" A 2013 Gallup poll found that only a quarter of American 18 to 29 year olds believe their standard of living is declining. In the CNN-Jana poll, even fewer -- 15 percent -- failed to succumb to optimism. Overwhelming as it is, however, that optimism fails to mask the depth of Africa's subsisting problems: The facts of jobless growth and rising inequality; that democracy is still largely a theoretical principle and government accountability mostly a mirage. It's a good thing the poll asks what respondents think is the biggest challenge their country is dealing with. The predictability of the responses -- 37 percent of respondents think corruption is Africa's biggest challenge, 23 percent think its rising inequality, 16 percent think its poverty -- paints, in my opinion, a truer picture than the confident optimism about the future. Not much has happened in the last few years to inspire much confidence that there will be a marked improvement in the coming years. Youth unemployment in Mandela's South Africa is one of the highest in the world. And it's a similar story across the continent: Fantastic economic growth jostling with technological revolutions everywhere you turn, but very little benefit trickling down to the lives of ordinary people. In truth Mandela being alive or dead will mean very little to the daily realities of most people. He will of course continue to be a towering icon of moral strength, the face of one of the most outstanding feats of political freedom in recent human history. But for economic freedom, the battle continues, in South Africa and elsewhere, and the end is nowhere in sight.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A British museum has canceled a lecture by Dr. James Watson, co-discoverer of the DNA double helix, after he claimed black people are less intelligent than whites in a recent newspaper interview. James Watson won the 1962 Nobel prize for discovering the structure of DNA. Watson, who won the 1962 Nobel prize for his part in discovering the structure of DNA, provoked a storm of criticism after his comments were published in the Sunday Times. The eminent biologist told the British newspaper he was ""inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa"" because ""all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours -- whereas all the testing says not really."" Watson, 79, had been due to give a lecture at London's Science Museum on Friday but the museum canceled his appearance, saying his comments had ""gone beyond the point of acceptable debate."" The American professor's words have been roundly condemned as ""racist,"" with fellow scientists dismissing his claims as ""genetic nonsense."" ""He should recognize that statements of this sort have racist functions and are to be deeply, deeply regretted,"" said Professor Steven Rose of the British Open University. Watson is credited with discovering the double helix along with Maurice Wilkins and Francis Crick in 1962. In the newspaper interview, he said there was no reason to think that races which had grown up in separate geographical locations should have evolved identically. He went on to say that although he hoped everyone was equal, ""people who have to deal with black employees find this not true"". The British government's skills minister, David Lammy, who is black, called the comments ""deeply offensive"" and said Watson would only succeed in providing oxygen for extremist political groups. ""It is a shame that a man with a record of scientific distinction should see his work overshadowed by his own irrational prejudices,"" Lammy told CNN. Watson is not the first scientist to show sympathy for the theory of a racial basis for intellectual difference. In March of last year Dr. Frank Ellis from Leeds University provoked anger in Britain after he admitted he found evidence that racial groups perform differently ""extremely convincing.""

"(CNN) -- Six of the suspected gunmen responsible for the killings of 72 migrants in Mexico have been identified, Mexican authorities said Monday, the state-run Notimex news agency reported. However, all of the suspects are dead, said Alejandro Poire, the spokesman for Mexico's president on security issues. Three were killed in a confrontation with the Mexican navy after the bodies were discovered, and three others were found dead inside a vehicle on the side of a highway, Poire said . The dead suspects were identified by the survivors of last month's massacre at a ranch near the town of San Fernando in the northeastern state of Tamaulipas. Three people are believed to have survived the mass killings, although only one -- an Ecuadorean man -- has spoken publicly. Mexican authorities have withheld details about survivors, citing safety concerns. A seventh suspect was arrested and is being held by authorities while they investigate possible charges against him, Poire said. Of the 72 migrants who were killed, 27 had been identified and their bodies returned to their home countries in Honduras and El Salvador, he said. The official said the preliminary investigation shows that the Zetas drug cartel was responsible for the killings.","Mexico says it has identified six of those responsible for massacre of 72 .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN)  -- After surveying training camps in eastern Afghanistan, Defense Secretary Robert Gates hinted Wednesday that U.S. troops could be leaving earlier than the announced July 2011 troop withdrawal date. Without giving details, Gates said that any early pullout and handover of control to Afghan forces ""would have to be conditions-based."" ""We will begin that transition no later than July 2011, but the pace will depend also on conditions on the ground,"" Gates said after watching training exercises at Camp Blackhorse, where U.S. and British forces train Afghan soldiers. Afghanistan Crossroads: The latest news on the ground . President Obama ordered the deployment of 30,000 extra U.S. forces to Afghanistan this year, increasing the total American troop commitment to almost 100,000, while at least 25 other countries have pledged another 7,000 troops. Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the U.S. commander in Afghanistan, has said Obama's additional goal to begin withdrawing U.S. troops in July 2011 will force Afghan officials to take the lead in ensuring their country's security. The U.S. hope would be to grow the Afghan National Security Forces to their authorized size of 170,000 soldiers and 134,000 police by the pullout date. Afghan Defense Minister Abdul Rahim Wardak, who accompanied Gates on the tour of Camp Blackhorse, said he was confident Afghan forces would stand up to the task. ""We have demonstrated that capability throughout the history,"" Wardak said, adding that much would depend on a strong government and the ability to provide essential services. Gates thanked the Afghan soldiers for their service. ""We will be your steadfast brothers in arms and friends,"" he said, concluding a two-day unannounced visit to Afghanistan. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was also in Afghanistan on Wednesday with a pledge to purge ""occupying forces"" from the troubled land. ""Iran has innovative plans for resolving ongoing problems in Afghanistan and the withdrawal of the occupying forces from the country,"" Ahmadinejad said ahead of landing in Afghanistan, Iran's state-run Press TV reported. Gates has accused Iran of ""playing a double game"" by befriending Afghan President Hamid Karzai's government while secretly aiding Taliban fighters. Gates said he told Karzai that Afghanistan ought to have good regional relations but its neighbors must play an upfront game. Gates visited Afghanistan as NATO-led coalition forces are pressing an offensive against Taliban forces around the town of Marjah in southern Helmand province. Dubbed Operation Moshtarak, the offensive was launched in February by an international coalition of 15,000 troops, including Afghans, Americans, Britons, Canadians, Danes and Estonians.","NEW: U.S. defense chief Robert Gates: U.S. withdrawal ""would have to be conditions-based""

"(CNN) -- A 59-year-old Michigan woman has been charged in connection with the death and dismemberment of the woman's 32-year-old son, a sheriff said Monday. Donna Scrivo was arraigned in St. Clair Shores, Michigan, on charges of disinterment and mutilation of a body, St. Clair County Sheriff Tim Donnellon said at a news conference. Body parts identified as those of Ramsay Scrivo, the suspect's son, were found in garbage bags dumped along Michigan roads, according to law enforcement officials. Officials at the press conference said they expect more charges to follow. An autopsy is not complete and a cause of death has not yet been determined, Detective Sergeant Jay Cohoe said at the news conference. According to court documents, Donna Scrivo filed a petition seeking hospitalization for mental illness of her son in May and was granted guardianship. The petition was filed shortly after Ramsay Scrivo's father's death, Cohoe said. ""From what I understand, it (the father's death) did have a negative impact on the family,"" Cohoe said. Officials stated that there was no history of assault allegations between Donna Scrivo and her son but police had been to the home on disorderly complaints. The body parts were found Thursday and Friday at five different locations in St. Clair County, a few miles from the Canadian border. A witness told police she saw a middle-aged woman in a light-colored SUV dumping what she initially thought was garbage in the area. Security camera footage from the area confirmed the witness' account. ""A suspect vehicle was identified and images broadcast of a person of interest,"" the St. Clair Shores police and the St. Clair County Sheriff's Office said in a joint news release Saturday. Ramsay Scrivo had been missing since January 26. His remains were identified through fingerprints. ""He would sit outside, very friendly,"" a neighbor told CNN affiliate WDIV. ""Well-respected, everyone talked to him. He would say hi to everybody."" Donna Scrivo was being held with bail set at $100,000, and with a preliminary hearing set for February 14, according to officials at the news conference. She had not obtained an attorney as of Monday afternoon, officials said. CNN's Joe Sutton and Rick Martin contributed to this report.","Body parts were discovered last week in garbage bags along roads in a Michgan County .

"(CNN) -- It was supposed to be a big day for Kevin Quick. His youngest brother was turning 40 and, to celebrate, Kevin planned a big birthday bash -- hiring a DJ, hanging decorations, not to mention inviting friends and family to join in the fun. But the host never showed up. The Waynesboro, Virginia, auxiliary police captain's absence from that party Saturday spurred his loved ones to look for him. When they had no luck, they turned to law enforcement. ""When he never showed, that was when people could tell there was something really wrong."" Sgt. Brian Edwards of the Waynesboro police department said. ""Family was really important to him. He wouldn't just ditch out on the family."" Authorities found his silver 1999 Toyota 4Runner parked under a metal carport in Mineral, Virginia. That's in a rural area about 60 miles east of Afton, where Quick left his mother's home on Friday night for what was expected to be a short ride out to visit a friend. They have linked two men to Quick's car and released a photo of one of them in hopes the public can offer more clues. Civic leaders have put up $22,500 in reward money for information leading to Quick, Edwards said. And given what they know about Quick, 45, and the case so far, the Virginia State Police have announced they suspect foul play. ""It was so truly out of character ... for him to just disappear like that,"" said Corinne Geller, a state police spokeswoman. 'Kevin is definitely a family man' Quick's family is deeply rooted in Waynesboro, a city of about 21,000 residents along the edge of the Appalachian Mountains some 25 miles west of Charlottesville. The family also has strong ties to its police department. Kevin's late father joined Waynesboro police's reserve arm in 1983. His eldest son joined him in 1990, ascending the ranks over the subsequent years. (The middle brother, Glenn, is an officer with the U.S. Capitol police in Washington.) Making up 15 of its 44 members, reserve members play a significant role in Waynesboro's police department, according to Edwards. Like full-timers, they hold ranks, have badges and carry firearms. ""Kevin and his family are institutions in the police auxiliary unit,"" Edwards said. Quick worked in the reserves while working paying day jobs, including the past 15 years as a production coordinator for the synthetic fabrics company Invista. His position there was eliminated in what Edwards called an ""amicable"" separation. Quick was given a severance package of an unknown amount, according to an affidavit released Tuesday. That money has not yet been accounted for. Even without a full-time job, Quick kept busy, with his apparent focus being his family, as it had been for years. The morning of Friday, January 31, he'd taken his mother -- with whom he was living in Afton -- out to breakfast at a local Cracker Barrel. That meal was the last time Quick's credit card was used, according to Edwards. He'd also spent that day prepping for his brother's surprise birthday celebration, including getting the venue and music in order. Quick had been legally separated from his wife since 2007, but their divorce was not final, Edwards said. He said another woman gave birth to Quick's daughter four months ago, and he was headed to their home in neighboring Albemarle County at the time he disappeared. According to the affidavit, Quick texted his child's mother, saying he was on the way. His phone has been turned off since Friday night. ""Kevin is definitely a family man,"" Edwards said. ""He is the eldest of three siblings, and he really took on the role of taking care of his mother (after his father died). ... He is a very dutiful son."" SUV tracked to 2 spots with unknown men . So when the party's 1 p.m. Saturday start time rolled around and there was no Kevin, his family suspected something was up. At that point, they didn't know that -- after leaving his mother's house around 10:15 p.m. Friday -- he never made it to the home of his child's mother, some 20 miles away at an apartment complex in Charlottesville. Authorities subsequently ""traced every possible route that he could have taken"" between those locations, according to Geller, as part of extensive air and ground searches. But they didn't find him. They were able to track his Toyota, however, to at least two spots in Virginia. The first such match was late Friday in Fork Union, which is located about 30 miles southeast of Charlottesville. On Saturday -- around when Quick should have been at his brother's party -- the SUV was spotted about 90 miles north of Fork Union in Manassas, in Prince William County. Photographs linked two men to Quick's vehicle. One image shows one of the men in a hooded sweatshirt covering much of his face. Does he or the other man know where Quick is? Authorities aren't sure, but they're hoping the public can help them track down the man in the photo they released so police can talk to him. As of Tuesday, police had not, though they had received at least 50 tips in the case. Rural Virginia residents shaken by case . So what happened to Kevin Quick? According to Edwards, authorities have already ruled out the possibility that he disappeared of his own accord. Citing the ongoing investigation, Geller from the state police hasn't offered much detail or laid out possible scenarios. She does say investigators have determined that the resident of Mineral who spotted Quick's Toyota shortly after 8 a.m. Monday -- parked at some point the previous night under a carport on his property, with no evident damage suggesting it had been in an accident -- has nothing to do with the case. The whole ordeal has shaken many throughout rural western Virginia. Chris Woodson says he's particularly unnerved by the idea that a law enforcement officer is missing. ""If the police can't even keep themselves safe, what are we supposed to do?"" Woodson, who lives in Mineral, told CNN affiliate WTVR. ""It makes me think that I'm going to have to lock my doors at night when I thought I lived in the country and I didn't have to do that."" The community has rallied around the Quick family, in person and online. In comments on the state police's Facebook page, numerous people offered their prayers, best wishes and laments for what the family is going through. Said one: ""I'm sick about this."" CNN's Carma Hassan contributed to this report.","Kevin Quick's phone has been turned off since Friday night .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A Chinese newspaper has withdrawn its high-profile support of a detained reporter after he confessed on television to releasing fabricated stories ""for money and fame."" The New Express printed a letter of apology on its website on Sunday that said the newspaper had failed to fact-check his articles and would manage its journalists more closely. The apology was in contrast to the spirited support the publication had given its reporter in the aftermath of his arrest last week. When contacted by CNN, the paper said that it had been asked not to give interviews. Chen Yongzhou was detained by police in Hunan Province on October 18 on suspicion of damaging the commercial reputation of a business after he published a series of articles that exposed financial problems at Zoomlion Heavy Industry Science & Technology . On Saturday, he appeared on state broadcaster CCTV and confessed to accepting money to publish false reports about the state-run maker of construction equipment. ""I did not check the content of these articles and only made minor changes. The original drafts were provided by other people,"" Chen said in the interview. Chen wrote more than 10 unverified reports -- from September 29, 2012, until August 8, 2013 -- that centered on ""financial problems"" experienced by the engineering company Zoomlion Heavy Industry Science & Technology, and resulted in losses for the company, Xinhua reported, citing police. In a bold move, New Express had run the headline ""Please set him free"" on its front page on Wednesday. It reiterated its plea on Friday. The paper also said it had checked all of Chen's stories about Zoomlion and found only one discrepancy. David Bandurski, editor of the China Media Project at the University of Hong Kong, said the newspaper had taken an unprecedented step in its public defense of the reporter but authorities felt it had gone too far. ""You can get away with it if you have the political backing, but if you don't you are stepping into dangerous territory and accurate or not accurate is not the most important question,"" he said. He added that the CCTV broadcast of Chen's confession underlined the political nature of the case, given that the legal investigation has not been completed and Chen has not appeared in court. The reporter's plight had garnered sympathy from other news outlets and China's media regulator vowed to protect ""lawful reporting rights,"" according to the state-run China Press and Publishing Media group. However, on Sunday the All China Journalists Association said, while it would uphold the legal rights of news professionals, it was ""against the abuse of news gathering, making profits through news, news blackmailing, and all kinds of violations of journalism ethics. ""All news professionals should learn a lesson from this, and should be fully aware of the serious damage of profitable news and news blackmailing.""

"London (CNN) -- You've answered the call for volunteers, signed up for the Mars trip and you are looking forward to boldly going to space, the final frontier, to explore a strange new world. But wait. Recent evidence from NASA's Curiosity rover mission to the Red Planet has revealed that astronauts on the round-trip would be exposed to high levels of radiation from cosmic rays and high-energy particles from the sun contained in solar storms. NASA says a Mars voyager would receive a radiation dose around 100 times the average yearly exposure on Earth. Along with all the other risks of spaceflight, this would clearly be bad for your health -- and it is proving difficult to find a solution. Eddie Semones, a radiation health expert at NASA's Johnson Space Flight Center, told CNN that shielding to completely block the radiation danger would have to be ""meters thick"" and too heavy to be used aboard a spacecraft. In contrast, with the release of the Star Trek movie ""Into Darkness,"" science fiction fans have once again got used to the ease with which Captain Kirk gives the order for ""shields up"" and the crew of the Enterprise being protected instantly from the hostility of space. Perhaps though, a real Star Trek shield may no longer be science fiction -- scientists at the UK's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) certainly think so. Radiation 'potential showstopper' They have been testing a lightweight system to protect astronauts and spacecraft components from harmful radiation and working with colleagues in America to design a concept spaceship called Discovery that could take astronauts to the Moon or Mars. ""Star Trek has great ideas -- they just don't have to build it,"" said Ruth Bamford, lead researcher for the deflector shield project at RAL. ""The radiation problem is a potential showstopper. I'm very concerned that the radiation issue is not being addressed very publicly and it's absolutely key. ""Even if astronauts are sick for 3-4 days, it could still threaten the mission because the whole crew are affected -- and vomiting and diarrhea in space is no joke. It could also potentially lead to organ failure,"" said Bamford. The RAL plan is to create an environment around the spacecraft that mimics the Earth's magnetic field and recreates the protection we enjoy on the ground -- they call it a mini magnetosphere. ""On Earth, mostly we're protected by the atmosphere but ultimately what the Earth's magnetic field is doing is forming a first line of protection for life,"" explained Bamford. ""The concept behind what we're suggesting is due to the evolution in our understanding of plasmas. What we discovered is that if you put a magnetic field around an object in a flowing plasma, the electrons, which are very light, will follow the new magnetic field that you've put there but the ions, the very fast ions, will overshoot -- they won't follow the magnetic field lines. ""You end up with a constant electric field that can be enough that it actually refracts or deflects enough of the radiation from inside the magnetic cavity that you've formed to protect the astronauts ... enough like the Earth that they can survive."" The mini-magnetosphere concept has also been proposed by a team at the University of Washington in the United States as a way of harnessing the solar wind to create a propulsion system. Other shielding ideas are also being explored. The Inspiration Mars Foundation that is committed to sending a crew to Mars has proposed lining the spacecraft's walls with water, food and even human waste to help protect the astronauts. Early results 'pleasing' New Scientist magazine recently reported that the ""hydrocarbons in excrement and food are good candidates for radiation shielding."" It added: ""NASA's Water Walls project uses a similar concept, but Inspiration must make it work for real."" As a child, Bamford was inspired to explore a scientific career by the Apollo moon landings and is a fan of the Star Trek series. She believes the concepts explored in the science fiction films are a useful shorthand for scientists when trying to explain their work. The RAL deflector shield she has helped to develop has been tested on a model inside a fusion reactor which produces a plasma like that of the solar wind. Bamford said they were delighted with the results. The RAL team now hope the project can be scaled up and fly on a real craft. ""First we need a technology demonstrator in space in, say, five years,"" said Bamford. ""That's quite realistic for a dedicated, small, unmanned spacecraft. ""I'm sure our idea will work. It does work. There are a number of improvements to make it work better though -- perhaps we should call down to Scotty.""","NASA's Curiosity mission to Mars revealed that astronauts on a round-trip would face high radiation levels .

"Washington (CNN) -- An air of inevitability exists around Hilary Clinton for 2016. Of course she hasn't said she will run -- that's a decision she said she'll make this year -- but she must feel pretty good about the tea leaves. A new CNN/ORC poll out this week found that 70% of Democrats said they are likely to support her if she launches a presidential bid. Additionally, she is beating top-tier Republican contenders, including New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, in hypothetical matchups. Democratic strategist Maria Cardona predicted, with the caveat that a lot can happen between now and then, that if she runs, ""I don't think she'll have anyone running against her."" That's because she is in such a strong position with her name recognition and her vast network of supporters, donors and campaign infrastructure ready to go. Emory political science professor Alan Abramowitz said the chances of Clinton being upset, like what happened in the 2008 primaries, are slim. ""I don't see who's going to be the Obama of 2016,"" he said. Would she say no? But plenty of reasons exist for her to simply say no. Presidential campaigns are unbelievable grinds and they can exact a substantial personal toll. They're full of endless days, personal attacks, and heart-clogging food. There are infinite details to master, personalities to manage, debates, and then throw in the unknowns. She will be 69 on Election Day 2016 and would have been in the political spotlight for a quarter century by then. She would have run once as the favorite for her party's nomination and lost. Many people might reflect on a similar public service career and conclude there's nothing left to prove, or that it's time for others to get in the game even if becoming the first woman president was the prize. But what if Clinton doesn't run? Multiple people associated with the Democratic Party say there is a host of promising potential contenders. But one strategist, a veteran of several Democratic presidential campaigns who asked not to be identified so he could speak freely, said, ""People saw Governor Clinton and Senator Obama as superstars."" As for the potential 2016 crop: ""No one talks about the rest of the field that way."" Except for Joe Biden. ""The truth is that, if Hillary doesn't run Biden becomes the class of the field by far,"" the veteran Democratic strategist told CNN. ""It's gotta be Hillary or Joe or we're in trouble."" Biden has been cagey with his intentions, dropping humorous references but refusing to commit. But his name recognition as vice president and as a veteran of the presidential campaign trail, some in the party think Biden is in a good position. Though, he would be 73 on Election Day 2016 and 74 on Inauguration Day. That's ""middle age"" for a U.S. senator, but no one has ever walked into the Oval Office on their first day of work at that age. Jim Manley, a former top Senate aide, thinks Biden ""deserves a shot"" because he's been ""outstanding"" as vice president. But Joe is Joe. People either love him, hate him or forget about him. For some Democratic operatives, Biden is almost an afterthought. People spouted off numerous potential Democratic candidates and Biden's name would come up, eventually. ""Oh yes, Joe Biden,"" said one strategist after gently jogging his memory. The progressive wing of the party is not impressed. Adam Green, co-director of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, left it at this: ""Joe Biden has had a great career in public service."" After the interview concluded, Green e-mailed to say that his co-director, Stephanie Taylor, has this to say about a Biden run: ""That would be funny,"" Taylor said. Martin O'Malley . Democratic pollster Margie Omero said Democrats Biden and Clinton aren't the only two who can appeal to Democratic voters. The party has ""a really strong bench of candidates that people are excited about that have progressive appeal."" She included Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, saying he has ""quietly and consistently"" built a strong record of good schools and good economy in Maryland. Interestingly, in this informal survey of half a dozen Democratic operatives and one political science professor, people mentioned O'Malley most often than any other possible contender, including Biden, but their reaction was far more muted. Manley said the ""jury is out"" and Abramowitz mused, ""I just don't know what kind of candidate he'd be."" Green called O'Malley ""a blank slate."" O'Malley is laying the groundwork for a run in the event Clinton doesn't, a source close to the governor told CNN. O'Malley amplified 2016 speculation when he told the Washington Post last week that he can't wait for the former first lady and secretary of state to make a decision. Elizabeth Warren . The first-term Massachusetts senator would have even less experience in public office than Obama when he ran in 2008. But Democrats have a high opinion of the former Harvard professor whose advocacy paved the way for the Consumer Federal Protection Bureau. Former Obama aide Bill Burton said Warren was one of a handful of ""impressive"" Democrats who could fill the bill should Clinton stay out. Cardona said Warren has to be ""put on any list."" The progressives love her for her populist agenda. Green said Warren is ""the north star"" of the Democratic Party. Kirsten Gillibrand . New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand's name also came up as a potential contender. But Cardona said she would have to get over her lack of name recognition, which she said is relatively easy to do. Manley, however, said it's ""too soon"" for New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand. She should show her campaigning and fundraising capabilities as head of the Democrat's Senate campaign arm. Andrew Cuomo . The New York governor received the most negative response from respondents, if he was mentioned at all. Manley said Andrew Cuomo should ""stick to being the governor of New York."" Green said he represents the Democratic Party from the 90s and would not fit in well with today's voters, adding that he ""pays lip service"" to progressives. More on the bench? There are other possibilities, including: Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer, Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper and Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick. But even though lifelong people had little to say as they are so unknown on a national scale. ""I'm not sure what I can say,"" Manley said. ""Untested"" is how Emory professor Abramowitz described the field outside of Biden and Clinton. ""All these other candidates have never run for national office so we don't know how they'd do.""","Some Democrats feel even without Clinton, Biden, their crop of 2016 candidates is strong .

"WEST HOLLYWOOD, California (CNN) -- The date was October 13, 2007. In four hours, T.I. was scheduled to appear at the BET Hip-Hop Awards in Atlanta, Georgia, where he was nominated for nine trophies. ""I have a lot of people to make proud,"" T.I. says. Instead, the hip-hop superstar found himself handcuffed in a downtown parking lot for attempting to buy machine guns and silencers in an undercover sting. He pleaded guilty to illegal weapons possession and was sentenced to seven months of house arrest, 1,500 hours of community service and one year in jail -- which he begins serving next March. In the meantime, T.I.'s new CD, ""Paper Trail,"" has become his third consecutive No. 1 album. And if that isn't enough, he sits at No. 1 and No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart with ""Live Your Life"" and ""Whatever You Like."" CNN Senior Producer Denise Quan spoke with the multiplatinum rapper, born Clifford Harris Jr., backstage before a recent show at the Key Club in West Hollywood, California. CNN: When I first heard about the charges, I said, ""You have got to be kidding. WHY?"" T.I.: Well, in order to fully understand the answer to that question, you will have to put yourself in my shoes. You know how many attempts have been made against my life? There are people out there that would rather kill you than to tell you ""Good luck"" or ""I am happy for you."" So until you understand that, you wouldn't understand my train of thought. iReport.com: What do you think? Share thoughts on video . Not to say it was right. It's just my best explanation. CNN: What scares you? T.I.: Federal court dates. (Laughs) CNN: Are you scared about going to jail for a year? T.I.: I wouldn't describe it as fear. I would describe it more as concerned. Concerned, and I am a little anxious. Sooner I get started, sooner I get finished.  Watch T.I. talk about his hope for redemption » . CNN: What do you think is the biggest misconception is about you? T.I.: The biggest misconception is that I am a hotheaded thug. Ignorant, cold-hearted, just another ignorant rapper who had a chance at success and has done nothing but horrible things with it. Nothing can be further from the truth. CNN: Do you think you have a lot to prove? T.I.: A lot to prove? No. I have a lot of people to make proud. Even the government -- the people in the government who stood up for my conditions to be the way they are, rather than the way a lot of people wanted them to be. The last thing I want to do is let them down. You know, they kind of stepped outside of the norm, as far as allowing me to be at home on a house arrest situation, whereas charges like mine would have normally been no bond, no consideration for bond. When I saw that they were trying to give me another chance, that kind of showed me something -- like, ""You can't blow it."" You gotta meet God halfway. You have to help him help you. CNN: You've done the seven months of house arrest. And you're in the midst of completing the 1,500 hours of community service ordered by the court. T.I.: Absolutely, yeah. Getting people to register to vote, encouraging young kids to respect one another, and stressing the value of an education, and trying to do away with teen-on-teen violence as much as possible -- using my experiences to keep them from going down a similar path. CNN: The hip-hop community seems eager to get involved in registering young people to vote. T.I.: I think that the hip-hop community should definitely become more involved in the political process, because we are the most influential genre of entertainment in the world. CNN: But it seems as though some artists are holding back in terms of their involvement because they don't want to hurt their candidate. T.I.: Absolutely. You know, when you look at the situation with Ludacris [who wrote a pro-Barack Obama song that was condemned by the Obama camp for its negative lyrics about other politicians], I would not want my support of someone to hinder their chances. I think you have to know what helps and what hurts. CNN: You can't vote because you're a convicted felon. T.I.: As far as I know, that is the case. CNN: How much does that hurt? Is there a candidate you want to support? T.I.: Well, man, it isn't necessarily about a candidate that I want to support. I feel like I owe that to my kids, my little cousins, everybody in the generation under me, to try to make this world a better place, this nation a better place. I am not going to focus on what I can't do. I am going to focus on what I CAN do. CNN: How many kids do you have now? T.I.: Six. CNN: Six?! How many kids do you want? T.I.: I'll have as many as the Lord blesses me with. So be it, as long as I have enough money to take care of them. I don't ever want to have kids who don't know their brothers and sisters. I want them all to grow up together, knowing each other, living together. I don't ever want to have some secret children. CNN: That's very Bob Marley of you. T.I.: (Laughs) CNN: Do you think there's been a price to pay for your success? T.I.: Absolutely. Absolutely. There has definitely been a price to pay. So far, it has cost me my best friend [T.I.'s 26-year-old personal assistant, Philant Johnson, was killed in a freeway shooting after a 2006 concert in Cincinnati], it has cost me time in jail, it has cost me time away from my family. I have missed four birthdays, two first days of school, four football games and a few more other things. Important outings that I would have liked to be home for. But I mean -- I'm not going to complain about it, you know what I'm saying? I prayed for this for so long, and now I got it, you know? So I am going to maintain my position. CNN: How have the experiences of the last couple of years changed you? T.I.: In many ways. I think I have a calmer spirit. I think I have become a man of thought, rather than a man of action. I think I have evolved as a person. I think I have grown. I have stepped outside of the tough exterior shell I used to have. I am still myself. I still know how to get down with the best of them, but it ain't necessary to show that. There is no room in my life for that part of me. CNN: Do you ever worry you are going to get into trouble again? T.I.: Nope. That is not a slight -- I don't even consider this. I got it now. I got it now.","T.I. was found guilty of weapons possession, will serve prison time .

"San Diego (CNN) -- It used to be that our elected officials could be counted on to pull us out of our comfort zones with creative and provocative statements on the critical issues of our time. They would challenge us and force us to think deeply and defend our beliefs. Not anymore. That sort of loose talk can alienate folks and cost you campaign contributions. So today, that role of political provocateur is filled by, of all things, Super Bowl commercials. The most controversial and important advertisement for this year's championship game is not that multilingual Coca-Cola ad that everyone is talking about, the one that caused so much needless angst in the culture wars and has nativists threatening to boycott the soft drink maker. The more significant, and more troubling, spot in this year's assortment of Super Bowl ads didn't use multiculturalism to sell soda. It used protectionism -- along with patriotic references to ""American pride"" -- to sell cars. Specifically, the idea was to sell cars made in the United States and, even more to the point, cars made in Detroit by Chrysler. The commercial veered off into the surreal when it cast Bob Dylan as an anti-globalist. Channeling the kind of small-minded protectionism you heard from union leaders during the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement, a voice urges you to support the home team and buy American. ""Detroit made cars,"" the narrator says, ""and cars made America."" Dismissing foreign imports, he says, ""you can't import the heart and soul of every man and woman working on the line."" So ""import"" is a dirty word? Well, maybe not. The car featured in the commercial is the Chrysler 200, which is being billed as ""America's import."" What in the world does that mean? How do you ""import"" something that is made in America? This could be a case of Chrysler trying to be too cute. The company knows that -- from handbags to shoes to wines -- imports are popular. So it's trying to use the popularity of that word to package its car as a domestic import? What a paradox. The secret ingredient behind all this workmanship? ""American pride."" Yet here is the question that the commercial doesn't answer. Is this American pride an asset, or a liability? That is, a good thing or a bad thing? The message is that American pride is undeniably good because it gives one the satisfaction that comes from crafting a fine automobile. Still, the truth is that it has a bad side as well. It's that pride -- the sense that we're better than everyone else -- gets in the way of competing with the rest of the world. We think we're entitled to make cars for as long as like, and at the wages that we demand and deserve. Why? Because we're Americans, and we're proud -- too proud to settle for less. Finally, as Dylan walks into a pool hall -- radiating cool -- his apparent voice-over goes in for the kill. ""Let Germany brew your beer,"" he says. ""Let Switzerland make your watch. Let Asia assemble your phone. We will build your car."" The spot seemed like a union-produced video designed to recruit new members. Not that the commercial wasn't well made. It was. But it was still a bad idea, and it conveyed a potentially harmful message. Millions of Americans tune in to watch the Super Bowl. We need our countrymen to understand that no jobs are marked ""reserved,"" just for them, like tables in a restaurant. They have to compete in the global marketplace. It doesn't help them to try to close off foreign competition. Ironically, the people who run Chrysler -- or rather used to run it -- understand this principle well. You see, the company was recently sold to the Italian carmaker Fiat. When the company went up for sale, the original owners could have insisted that the buyer be American. You know, American pride and all that. But it didn't. Instead, company officials entertained offers from abroad; in fact, you could say that the owners ""imported"" prospective buyers. And when a deal was finally struck, the sale went to a foreign company. How about that? The United Auto Workers union owned 41.46% of Chrysler, a stake that Fiat recently agreed to buy. So while the union extols the virtue of U.S. labor, it has no qualms about accepting money from abroad. When they put up a ""For Sale"" sign, the former owners of Chrysler looked all over the world for the best deal. And now that it's under new management, the company wants to discourage car buyers from doing the same. That's wrong. And it's going to take more than a slick ad to make it look right. But one part of the commercial rings true, and it takes us back to Dylan. It turns out that maybe casting the iconic musician in this role wasn't a stretch after all. Music writers and others who have followed his career in recent years have detected, as early as 2006, a growing opposition to globalization, or at least an unease about its effects on U.S. workers. So it's silly for some people to be talking about how Dylan ""sold out"" by making this commercial. He didn't. He is where he's long been on this issue. It's just that Chrysler finally caught up to him. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Ruben Navarrette: Super Bowl ads fill void of officials refusing to be provocative .

"(CNN) -- Pop star Justin Bieber was arrested Thursday and was charged with drunken driving, resisting arrest and driving without a valid license after police spotted him street racing early Thursday morning. Here's what we know about elements of the case: . 1. Bieber ""made some statements that he had consumed some alcohol, and that he had been smoking marijuana and consumed some prescription medication,"" said Miami Beach Police Chief Raymond Martinez. How did Bieber, who's just 19, get the alcohol, marijuana and pills? An excellent question, and one that has no certain answer. Bieber may be 19 but he had ""an entourage of about 15 people,"" says CNN's John Couwels. In Miami Beach that included Bieber's father, Jeremy Bieber, 38. Given money, fame and willing pals, Bieber conceivably had access to whatever he desired. Justin Bieber arrested on drunken driving, resisting arrest charges . 2. Bieber was driving a yellow Lamborghini. Again, given his age, how did he rent it? Lou La Vie, the exotic-auto rental establishment from which Bieber rented the Lambo, posted a blog entry and a series of pictures about the return of the vehicle and another on Thursday. ""For everyone that was concerned with the news, the cars are back safe and sound! Believe half of what you see and none of what you hear,"" the firm wrote. According to Lou La Vie's rental policy, ""LLV requires driver to be 25 years of age and older to rent a vehicle. In certain cases, we may be able to rent to drivers between the ages of 21-25."" The Lamborghinis rent for between $600 and $1,800 a day, and require a deposit of between $5,000 and $12,000. The person who made the rental for Bieber hasn't been revealed. Rob Ferretti, the COO of Gotham Dream Cars, which has a Miami location, says his company requires both a valid driver's license and valid insurance and will not rent to people under 21. Gotham also runs a license check to make sure there aren't any surprises in the driver's background, Ferretti says. However, he observed, those policies aren't uniform in the rental-car world. The Smoking Tire's Matt Farah told Jalopnik.com that the onus is on the rental company, not the renter. ""The law varies by state but technically anyone under 21 shouldn't be driving even if someone of age signs for the car,"" he said. ""It would be the burden of the rental company to prosecute that, though; as long as the car isn't stolen the cops wouldn't care."" 3. Bieber is a Canadian citizen. Could this arrest lead to his deportation? It's too early to say. First of all, Bieber has not been convicted of a crime. Second, the charges thus far are misdemeanors. The state attorney's office told CNN that it could take several weeks to determine what type of charges may be added -- if there are charges added at all. U.S. immigration law says people can be deported if they're convicted of what's called an ""aggravated felony"" or a ""crime of moral turpitude."" HLN's Vinnie Politan, a former prosecutor, points out, ""DUI is not an aggravated felony. However, 'aggravated DUI' can be considered a crime of moral turpitude. An aggravated DUI in Florida is generally charged for repeat offenders or in cases where an accident has occurred resulting in serious injury or death."" However, Politan says he believes Bieber would not likely face deportation as a result of these charges. 4. Could the police file more charges in the Bieber case? Maybe. The state attorney's office told CNN it is looking at a variety of sources, including social media accounts, and will decide if other charges are warranted, including contributing to the delinquency of a minor or street racing. Bieber and his cohort, R&B singer Khalil, were doing up to 60 mph in a 30 mph zone, according to the police report. 5. Was Bieber given preferential treatment? There aren't any reports of the Miami Beach Police treating Bieber any differently than other people they've arrested. However, three officers in nearby Opa-Locka have been suspended in connection with allegations that they escorted Bieber's caravan in the Miami area without authorization this week. CNN's John Couwels and Tory Dunnan contributed to this report.","Justin Bieber's arrest Thursday raises several questions .

"(CNN) -- Author Joe McGinniss, who chronicled the murder case of former Green Beret doctor Jeffrey MacDonald in the 1983 book ""Fatal Vision,"" has died, his lawyer said Monday. He was 71. McGinniss died Monday afternoon at UMass Memorial Medical Center in Worcester, Massachusetts, said friend and attorney Dennis Holahan. He had been battling prostate cancer for two years. He also wrote the 1969 bestseller ""The Selling of the President 1968,"" a close look at the marketing and campaigning of presidential candidate Richard Nixon. McGinniss had fly-on-the-wall access for Nixon's victorious run. Nixon had learned his lesson from his 1960 loss to John F. Kennedy. In '68, he put together a team of advisers to mold his television image, including 1960s TV hit ""Laugh-In"" head writer Paul Keyes, former CBS executive Frank Shakespeare, ad man Harry Treleaven and a producer named Roger Ailes, who had been working for former big-band singer Mike Douglas' daytime talk-variety show. (Ailes is now head of Fox News Channel.) Together, Nixon's team played to the candidate's strengths and minimized his weaknesses (""Avoid closeups,"" wrote Treleaven in one memo). Today, the book's details may seem old hat -- but still make for revealing reading. In 2012, McGinniss, critcized by MacDonald supporters who said he betrayed the doctor, told CNN that he embedded with the defense team because he thought it would be fascinating to see how the lawyers and accused handled a high-profile murder case. MacDonald was convicted of stabbing his pregnant wife and two young daughters to death at their home on a North Carolina military base. ""I learned everything from the first time in court. I didn't have my mind made up,"" McGinniss said. MacDonald has steadfastly maintained his innocence. McGinniss also made news when he moved next door to Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin in 2010 and wrote ""The Rogue."" Palin theatened to sue, saying the book was ""a series of lies and rumors presented as fact."" He wrote 12 books in all, according to his website. According to publisher Simon & Schuster, McGinniss lived in Massachusetts with his wife, Nancy Doherty, an editor and writer. He had five children -- including author Joe McGinniss Jr. -- and seven grandchildren. People we've lost in 2014 .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- What does yours sound like? New tunes: One of the inventors behind popular game 'Guitar Hero', Tod Machover, is now working with robots. It's a question that could one day be as common as asking what your Facebook profile picture is -- at least if Tod Machover has anything to do with it. The self-described composer/inventor/educator from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT) Media Lab is working at the leading edge of interactive music -- designing a range of new concepts, including personal operas. Personal operas could one day allow humans to record the details of our lives -- our feelings, relationships, and beliefs -- in our own personalized opera show. Machover told CNN the personal opera is something he would like to see available for everyone in future. ""It's about what you can pass on for others. If you could make that system available for everybody you can leave your stories, your images behind. Opera has always attracted me as you can tell a whole story with it,"" he said. With this concept, instruments can adapt to the way people behave or express themselves, so a person's personality can be shown through the music and performance of an opera - which would also allow images and other memories to form part of the show. The technology would allow users to leave behind their legacy, he said. Machover's MIT Media Lab has developed software which drives the project, called ""Hyperscore."" Hyperscore allows the user to make real music using just lines and colors. The user draws in the lines and colors and the notes are automatically made from that, he said. In a new leap incorporating these ideas, Machover has been working on an operatic performance called ""Death and the Powers"" which details the life of Simon Powers -- a man he describes as ""a mixture of Walt Disney, Bill Gates and Howard Hughes."" The show debuts at Monaco in September 2009, and Machover said it should revolutionize the world of opera -- by introducing the personal opera combined with robotic instruments and 'hyperinstruments'. It also includes the world's first robotic stage. ""He [Powers] wants to leave his memories and relationships behind but he himself wants to be gone. Once he does go, the main character after that is the stage itself,"" Machover said. But how does this work? Machover said there are several aspects, including 16 robotic boxes that can move around on stage by themselves. ""They play the role of a Greek chorus. They will be themselves and they come alive. Some of them come in and out. It's a visual and musical language which isn't anthropomorphic."" ""The chandelier is also a robotic instrument. It has strings and these are played by little mechanical fingers that pluck the strings. You can send acoustic signals to it as well,"" Machover said. Amazing as it is, this is only one strand of Machover's remarkable work. ""Hyperinstruments"" are about making instruments that respond in new ways to those playing them. Machover has also been able to alter how each instrument can be controlled. ""I started imagining sounds that I just couldn't make from traditional instruments,"" he said. ""With a computer we can build any instrument you can imagine. For example with a 'hypercello' we can make it so that if you flick your wrist the whole tonality changes about it. ""And the relationship between what instructions you give the instrument and what result you get at the other end doesn't have to be the same. You can make the instrument very much like an existing instrument or you can make it very different. If you are making a hyperinstrument for a five-year-old then you want to make it very easy to tap and play,"" he said. Machover is undoubtedly passionate about making the musical experience accessible to everyone, and it was work from his MIT Media Lab which brought about the blockbuster video game ""Guitar Hero."" He believes that type of interfacing can soon be developed further. ""What would happen if you had such experiences where you could actually learn how to play the guitar? I think that's something we are going to see fairly soon,"" Machover said. Machover is also interested in a new type of collaboration between the people making music and the people listening which he says appears to be already beginning. He cites the example of the band Radiohead, which offered for sale all of the individual tracks for one of its songs to encourage listeners to create their own version. ""It would be excellent if somebody got interested in this side of music and then got some feedback, or if Radiohead now and then got ideas back that blew them away. I think that kind of thing is possible."" Just when you think Tod Machover has exhausted every musical concept you could think of, he admits he's plotting another. Given that he lives on a farm, it's no surprise Machover would like to use some of his concepts to explore the musical abilities of animals. ""We have believed for a long time that humans are the only musicians. It's beginning to look more and more likely that this isn't true. We have only scratched the surface as to what musical creatures are around,"" Machover told CNN. He firmly believes that animals will have a lot to offer the musical world. ""Before I die I would like to do an animal piece. It will be a way of seeing what animals are really doing."" Lisa Botter also contributed to this report .","Tod Machover is working to improve musical experiences for everyone .

"(CNN) -- Fried chicken. Mashed potatoes. Collard greens. These were the foods Chris Ross grew up on in rural Kentucky. ""One of the earliest food memories I have is my grandfather making hamburgers ... my grandmother frying potatoes,"" he says. ""Of course, in those days, everything was fried in lard."" Ross still enjoys those foods, despite having lost -- and kept off -- more than 100 pounds. He doesn't make substitutions or skip the bun. His weight loss secret isn't really a secret at all. He simply eats less. Ross, the executive chef at Bristol Catering in Louisville, Kentucky, started gaining weight after high school while working in restaurants, first as a waiter, then as a cook. At the time, he was studying law enforcement in college, but in between classes, he came home to watch the Food Network. ""I just got consumed,"" he says. He didn't really notice that he had gained 20 or 30 pounds over his freshman year. He ignored the signs when his clothes stopped fitting. Later, when an overweight friend at work mentioned their similarities, he was confused. ""I never saw it,"" Ross says. ""It's a weird realization when you're gaining weight. You think, you're getting older. Maybe it's normal."" Then in late 2004, Ross stepped on a scale for the first time in years. The scale, which only went up to 300 pounds, refused to register his weight. That was bad. When he finally found another scale to tell him the truth, it was worse. The 6-foot-2-inch chef was 327 pounds. ""To realize that you're not just obese, but morbidly obese, it was pretty tough on the mental psyche."" Ross started looking at his daily habits a little closer. He switched from regular Coke to Coke Zero and lost 10 pounds over a couple months. Then he picked up a book -- ""French Women Don't Get Fat"" by Mireille Guiliano -- that he saw Oprah Winfrey discussing on her show. As a chef, he'd always had a love for Paris. If anything could motivate him, this was it. The book talked about eating smaller portions, drinking water and walking everywhere. So Ross started doing the same. He tried to drink eight glasses of water every day, and he made an effort to walk for at least an hour before or after work. Take upwave's challenge: Drink more water! The book's tips helped him drop another 20 pounds. But it wasn't enough. After reading about a New Orleans chef who had lost weight, Ross decided to conduct an experiment. For one day, he wrote everything that he tasted at his restaurant down on disposable spoons and tossed the spoons into a pan. At the end of the day, he tallied the calories. He had consumed more than 4,000 just from tasting his dishes. ""Breakfast, lunch, dinner in addition to that -- I was taking in 6,000 calories a day,"" Ross says. ""And not being an Olympic athlete, it was kind of hard to burn it off."" Ross couldn't stop tasting his food. So he started discreetly spitting out his tastes into the trash. From that point on, nothing could stop him. When he hit 250 pounds, he started jogging. When he lost 10 more pounds, he ran a 5K race. When he got down to 230 pounds, he proposed. Then he and his fiancee started taking a friend's Zumba class. ""Man, the weight really started falling off then,"" he says. ""I'm a 36-year-old white guy with no rhythm. It's a fun exercise when you get over the fact that you feel stupid doing it."" By the time the couple married in July 2011, Ross weighed 190 pounds. ""I think the only way to really consistently lose weight and keep it off is to develop moderation and portion control,"" he says. ""You need to eat what you want to eat, just try to maintain control."" With three kids and a growing catering company, the days of a 40-hour work week are long gone. Still, Ross makes time to run at least four days a week as he trains for the Kentucky Derby Festival miniMarathon on April 19. His weight fluctuates. Some days, dinner is a McDonald's double cheeseburger and kid-sized fries. He refuses to give up margarine, despite the FDA's warnings about the health risks of partially hydrogenated oils. But overall, Ross has adopted the healthy lessons he learned in ""French Women Don't Get Fat."" More importantly he's adopted the author's attitude: . ""The key? Not guilt or deprivation but learning to get the most from the things you most enjoy.""","Louisville chef Chris Ross started gaining weight after high school .

"PENSACOLA, Florida (CNN) -- A man police believe organized the slaying of a Florida couple earlier this month told authorities he knew the victims and received financial support from them for a martial arts studio, according to court documents released Monday. Leonard Patrick Gonzalez Jr., 35, is one of seven people charged with murder in the July 9 killings. Leonard Patrick Gonzalez Jr., 35, is one of seven people charged with murder in the July 9 deaths of Byrd and Melanie Billings of Beulah, Florida. An affidavit for a search warrant for Gonzalez's van noted the connection between him and the couple, but gave no other details. ""My understanding is, through speaking with the investigative agencies, that Mr. Gonzalez sought donations from a variety of community and business leaders and that perhaps Mr. Billings did not lend him money, but donated to this academy for children,"" Crystal Spencer, attorney for the Billings family, told CNN. ""It was a defense academy -- a self-defense academy for children. But the connection goes no further that we are aware of."" The Billingses, who were known for adopting special-needs children, were fatally shot during a home invasion robbery, according to police. Their bodies were found in their bedroom, said the court documents. Gonzalez told police he owns a red Dodge cargo van similar to one seen on surveillance video leaving the Billings home on the day of the slayings, but he said it was not in operating condition, according to an affidavit seeking a search warrant on the van. After a picture of the van seen at the crime scene was released to the media, a man contacted police to tell them it resembled a van he owned for a number of years and had recently sold to a woman named Terri Poff, the affidavit said. He provided pictures of the van, which appeared to match the one seen on the surveillance camera, including some of its unusual features, the documents said. The man told police that Poff told him she was buying the van for her son, Leonard Gonzalez, according to the affidavit.  Watch recap of the case and links between suspects » . Authorities located the van at Gonzalez's residence, and its vehicle identification number matched that provided by the previous owner, the documents said. A search warrant document filed with the court shows that in a July 11 search of the van, police took carpet samples, seat covers, a piece of duct tape, paint samples, and containers of disinfectant wipes, garbage bags and soap pads, among other items, the document said. Police previously have said robbery was a motive, but not the only motive. Asked whether the slayings could have been a contracted hit, Escambia County Sheriff David Morgan told CNN, ""This gets back to motive and we want to assure the public that we haven't taken that or anything off the table. We're looking for any reason, any motive for this to have happened, so yes, we are looking at a hit as a motive. Morgan told CNN he wanted to talk to up to nine more people and planned to make at least one more arrest before he winds down the investigation in a few days. He did not provide further details, but said authorities planned to interview Gonzalez's wife on Monday. The Billingses had adopted 13 children, and each had two biological children, but three of the adopted children have died. Police said nine of the children were home at the time of the home invasion; one of them managed to flee and seek help at a neighbor's home. Ashley Markham, one of the adult children from Byrd and Melanie Billings' previous marriages, said she has decided to move into the home to take care of the children. Markham told CNN that they are having work done on the home to make it safer before they move back in. Additional documents released Monday from the Florida Department of Children and Families show a bizarre attempt by Byrd Billings to copyright the children's names and request money from the department for their use. A department attorney, Katie George, told the Pensacola News-Journal that every time the agency sent Billings a letter referencing the children by name, he would reply with an invoice demanding millions in copyright infringement. In one document released by the department, he demands $10 million in silver or federal reserve notes of equal value. In a sharply worded letter of December 2005, another department attorney, Richard Cserep, wrote to Billings, ""you reference a wide variety of law in connection with this claim"" for damages. ""This includes copyright violations, trademark violations, contract violations, admiralty and maritime law, libel and the Truth in Lending Act. At no time in any of your correspondence have you made a plain demand for damages under a clear and cognizable theory of liability."" A handwritten note on the letter says that no further correspondence was received from Billings after that letter. A safe containing prescription medication, family documents and some jewelry was taken from the Billings home at the time of their slayings, authorities said. It was found in the back yard of Pamela Wiggins, an eighth suspect, who is charged with being an accessory after the fact. Wiggins is free on $10,000 bond.  Watch lawyer reveal contents of safe » . Morgan said when the safe was found, it was buried with bricks on top in ""an obvious attempt to conceal"" it. Wiggins is a friend and landlord of one of the suspects. Attempts by CNN to reach her and her attorney have been unsuccessful. One of the seven original suspects in the case, Donald Ray Stallworth, was arrested in Alabama. At a hearing Monday, Escambia County, Alabama, Judge Bert Rice withdrew an earlier $1 million bond and ordered Stallworth held without bail until Alabama Gov. Bob Riley signs an order to extradite him to Florida. Surveillance video from the home shows two vehicles pulling up to the property and five masked people dressed in black entering the house. Authorities believe both drivers remained in the vehicles. It appears the suspects did not believe they were under surveillance, Morgan said. The system, which was not disabled, was a ""gaping hole"" in a well-executed crime, he said. While the investigation into the murders continues, Markham said her focus now is on helping the rest of her family through the tragedy. She said she told the children about their parents, adding that her mother had explained heaven to the kids as a wonderful place. The kids were given balloons and told by writing messages on them, they would be able to talk to their parents since ""they were angels.""

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israel expressed regret Tuesday over the killing of a Palestinian judge from Jordan, who was shot by Israeli soldiers at a border crossing, and promised Amman that it would carry out a joint investigation into his death. The Israeli military had denounced Judge Raed Zeiter as a ""terrorist,"" saying he was shot dead Monday after he attacked soldiers at the Allenby Bridge crossing, also known as the King Hussein Bridge, while making his way to the West Bank. In a more conciliatory tone, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office issued a statement saying it was committed to its 1994 peace treaty with Jordan and would establish an Israeli-Jordanian team to look into what happened. ""Israel regrets the death of Judge Raed Zeiter yesterday at the King Hussein (Allenby) bridge and expresses its sympathies to the people and government of Jordan,"" the statement said. ""The joint team will commence its work promptly."" The Israeli military said Zeiter had tried to seize a soldier's weapon. The Palestinian Authority in the West Bank city of Ramallah condemned what it called the shooting ""at close range"" by Israeli troops. It demanded an investigation, as has Jordan, whose Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh summoned Israel's charge d'affaires in Amman after the incident. 'He arrived to us dead' Zeiter, 38, was a West Bank-born judge working in Jordan and on a break when he was killed. He was buried in the West Bank city of Nablus on Tuesday in a funeral attended by Palestinian officials and dignitaries. ""He was coming here to take care of some property, see his house and visit his family. He arrived to us dead,"" his cousin Nafe'e Zu'aiter told CNN. ""He was assassinated in cold blood; they could have shot him in the leg even though he provoked the soldier. Why three bullets to end his life?"" In a separate incident Monday, Israeli soldiers shot dead a 20-year-old Palestinian in the West Bank. The military said Palestinians had hurled rocks at an Israeli vehicle and bus near Beit Eil, and soldiers at the scene responded with gunfire. It said military police have opened an investigation. Palestinian medical sources identified the man as Sajee Darwish, a university media student, and said he had been shot in the back of his head. He was also buried in a heavily attended funeral Tuesday. Both incidents stoked tensions, particularly in Jordan, where the police presence was beefed up near Israeli and American premises. British Prime Minister David Cameron is scheduled to travel to Israel and the Palestinian Territories this week. Palestinian presidential spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeina said the killings were ""a dangerous provocation that would lead to the destruction of what is left of the peace process and is pushing the region to a dangerous momentum that cannot be controlled,"" according to a statement given to the WAFA news agency. Fallen drone . Separately, an Israeli airstrike killed three Gaza militants Tuesday, medical sources said, near an area where an unmanned Israeli surveillance aircraft crashed earlier in the day. The Israeli military said that the Skylark drone experienced a technical malfunction and that it was investigating what caused it to go down. It fell over southern Gaza. Israel uses drones to gather intelligence on militant activity in Gaza, a territory governed by the Palestinian Islamic militant group Hamas and where other armed groups also operate. A militant wing of Hamas, Al-Qassam Brigades, said in a prepared statement that it had recovered the drone. In a statement about the airstrike, the Israeli military said it was responding to mortar fire toward Israel. The medical sources said the three dead were members of the Islamic Jihad militant group. CNN's Michael Schwartz and Marie-Louise Gumuchian contributed to this report.","Israeli soldiers shoot and kill a Palestinian judge from Jordan at a border crossing .

"(CNN) -- With such events as men's downhill and women's slopestyle, Sunday's competition at the Sochi Winter Games may best described by the Olympic motto: Faster, higher, stronger. Here are five things to watch: . Men's downhill finals . America's Bode Miller, who may be the old man on the mountain at age 36, is looking to become king of the hill, er, downhill during Sunday's Olympic finals. He's laid down some of the fiercest and fastest training runs in the lead-up to what is widely considered one of Alpine skiing's marquee events, and nobody doubts he will push it to the limit to add a gold medal to his previous Winter Games haul of one gold, three silvers and a bronze. As those who follow the sport know, it only takes one bobble, one skid, one miscalculation on the 2.2-mile course at Rosa Khutor, and it could be all over. Miller's competitors in the downhill aren't going to just let him walk away with a medal, he's going to have to fight for it among a fast field. Who to watch: . Aksel Lund Svindal of Norway, who took silver in the men's downhill and the gold in the super-G during the Vancouver Games in 2010. He put up the second-fastest time on Saturday's training run behind Miller, according to Bleacher Report. Switzerland's Didier Defago, who took the gold in the event in Vancouver, and Austria's Matthais Mayer, whose training run Friday on the course eclipsed Miller, also are likely to be in the medal hunt. Women's slopestyle finals . At age 23, Jamie Anderson of the United States is considered one of the pioneers of women's snowboard slopestyle. (Think downhill obstacle course with rails and jumps.) So perhaps it is fitting that she is one of the odds-on favorites to medal in the event, making its Olympic debut at the Sochi Games. But don't count out Austria's Anna Gasser, who qualified for the event semifinal and final with the highest-scoring run. Anderson finished second. As Sage Kotsenburg of Team USA proved Saturday by winning an unexpected gold medal in men's slopestyle, anything is possible. Who else to watch: . Australia's Torah Bright, the 2010 Olympic gold medalist in the halfpipe, is a force to be reckoned with after putting in a solid qualifying run. Figure skating team finals . It's the final day of the Olympic debut of the team figure skating competition, and the field of 10 has been narrowed down to five teams. Here's what to know: Russia, Canada, the United States, Italy and Japan are vying for medals. So how do they do that? On Sunday, the teams will put forward skaters to compete in the men's, women's and ice dancing free programs. In armchair Olympic-speak, that means the long programs. The team with the highest overall score wins the gold, second highest gets the silver, third highest. ... You get the idea. No? Tune in to watch it. Men's skiathlon 30k finals . Ski-what-a-thon? Skiathlon, or in everyday language competitive cross-country skiing. Think of it this way. It's a 30-kilometer race where skiers switch out their classic cross country skis after 15 kilometers to skating skis, where they ski for another 15 kilometers. Switzerland's Dario Cologna, a dominant force in the sport, is considered the favorite going into the race. Who else to watch: . Petter Northug of Norway, who won two gold medals in Vancouver in 2010, is known for his sprint finishes, and Martin Johnsrud Sundby of Norway, who finished second at last year's World Championship Skiathlon, are expected to be in the hunt for medals. Men's individual normal hill ski jumping finals . Ski jumping seems like an adrenaline junkie's dream, strapping on a pair of skis, flying down a ramp and launching into the air. And it's pretty cool to watch, too. If the qualifying rounds are any indication, the finals on Sunday should not disappoint. Poland's Kamil Stoch, the reigning World Cup champion, is the favorite. Who else to watch: . Simon Ammann of Switzerland, who is trying to win a fifth Olympic gold, Germany's Severin Freund and Austria's Gregor Schlierenzauer are also contenders.","Bode Miller of Team USA is considered a gold medal favorite in men's downhill .

"(CNN) -- Two men in New York allegedly produced and sold counterfeit NFL tickets for popular post-season games, including Sunday's Super Bowl, and other high-profile events, the Queens County district attorney's office said Tuesday. Damon Daniels,43, of New York City, and Eugene Fladger, 32, of Philadelphia, allegedly forged and sold high-quality tickets on the Internet and on the streets of New York, according to the news release. Fraudulent items included tickets to the 2014 AFC championship game, the NFL Commissioner's Party at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan and the NFL Honors Party at Radio City Music Hall, according to the release. The forged tickets had the official NFL logo and bar code imprinted upon them; the printing on the tickets was washed out and not properly aligned, according to the release. ""The defendants are charged with not only running a lucrative illegal operation that allegedly ripped off the National Football League and sports fans alike by manufacturing well-crafted counterfeit tickets using state-of-the-art equipment but creating a security nightmare ... at this Sunday's Super Bowl by allegedly selling fraudulent parking passes,"" Queens District Attorney Richard Brown said in the release. ""Beyond that, individuals who bought tickets or passes through the Internet may be in for a rude awakening on game day."" An undercover investigation into the operation began in December after the NFL's Security Division notified the New York Police Department, according to the release. The joint investigation included the purchase or potential sale of 79 counterfeit tickets and parking passes for approximately $10,000, according to a news release from the police department. Police also recovered a computer, printer and the same photo-grade paper that was used to make the fraudulent tickets from Daniels' girlfriend's home, according to the release. Daniels also allegedly stated that he made the tickets at a Manhattan copy store, according to the release. They are each charged with 79 counts of second-degree forgery, 79 counts of second-degree criminal possession of a forged instrument, three counts of criminal possession of a forgery devices, one count of criminal possession of computer-related material, 79 counts of second-degree trademark counterfeiting and one count of fifth-degree conspiracy. Daniels and Fladger are being held, and it was unclear Tuesday night whether they had lawyers. If convicted, they could each face a maximum of seven years in prison.","Two men produced, sold fake tickets to Super Bowl and related events in New York .

"(CNN) -- It's taken less than a year for Jose Mourinho to go from being the ""Happy One"" to the ""Unhappy One"" --- and the Chelsea manager has pinned the blame squarely on the shoulders of the media for his mood swing. A favorite with British journalists due to his pithy comments, Mourinho is less pleased with Canal Football Club after the French football show broadcast an interview in which he appeared to criticize his club's strikers. Former Barcelona star Samuel Eto'o, $80 million signing Fernando Torres and Senegal international Demba Ba have struggled for goals in the English Premier League this season, netting just 11 times between them. Mourinho is unhappy because he didn't know he was being filmed at the time he made the comments. ""I really think it was a disgrace that somebody is recording a private conversation when obviously we don't know,"" a scowling Mourinho said ahead of Wednesday's Champions League tie against Galatasaray. However Canal Football Club's chief editor and anchor Herve Mathoux was unrepentant. ""We are fully comfortable with this interview,"" Mathoux told CNN. ""We are very surprised by Jose Mourinho's comments, claiming it was off the record. The camera was located 50 centimeters, maybe one meter away from him. It was a tight close up. ""The discussion was informal, but it was held in the middle of a large group of people, including our cameraman. So there is no way Mourinho could ignore he was filmed."" On Monday, Canal Plus published a video on its website, in which Mourinho commented: ""The problem with Chelsea is we lack a scorer. I have one (Eto'o) but he's 32. Maybe 35, who knows?"" The video has since reportedly been deleted by the French television channel, though Mathoux told CNN he wasn't aware of its removal. ""These videos come and go all the time. By definition they have quite a short lifespan,"" he said. However, British media analyst, journalist and broadcaster Steve Hewlett said he had sympathy for the Portuguese coach over the way he had been treated. ""Generally speaking you shouldn't record a private conversation unless there is a significant public interest anyway,"" Hewlett told CNN. ""In this case it's hard to see any public interest at all. ""A few comments he makes about a particular player wouldn't seem to me to pass any public interest test. I'm not saying it's not interesting, especially to a Chelsea fan. ""He's not what you'd call a media ingÃ©nue. He knows what he's doing. I'm sure he'll play this for all it's worth but on the face of it he would appear to have a case."" Mourinho spoke on Tuesday to both defend Eto'o and attack the media, with whom he has had a love-hate relationship throughout his career. ""I think you should be a bit embarrassed as it is against the ethics that you have in your work,"" said Mourinho, who returned as Chelsea manager last June after spells with Inter Milan and Real Madrid. Mourinho signed Eto'o at Inter and brought the four-time African player of the year to London from Russian club Anzhi Makhachkala on a one-year deal to bolster Chelsea's strike force this season. While Eto'o may no longer be the potent poacher he was for Barcelona in front of goal, Mourinho underlined his respect for the Cameroon international, who has scored eight goals this season for the English Premier League leaders. ""From my perspective the comment is not a good one, it's not something I would do in an official interview,"" the 51-year-old said. ""Firstly because I don't make fun and there are managers who really defend their players and I am obviously one of them. ""Thirdly Samuel Eto'o is Samuel Eto'o. He's four times a Champions League winner. It was with him that I had the best ever season of my career. ""There is no story, I repeat, it was a funny conversation between me and somebody that does not belong to the football world. ""From my own point of view, is it an unhappy comment? Absolutely, but I think by the ethical point of view, it (the situation) is a real disgrace.""","Jose Mourinho says the broadcast of a private conversation is ""a disgrace""

"(CNN) -- While Americans may still deck the halls and stuff the stockings this Christmas, a new poll finds that the state of the economy is playing a major role in how Americans will celebrate it in 2013. According to the CNN/ORC International poll, Americans plan to curtail their Christmas gift giving and charitable contributions due to economic concerns, while a sizable minority of Americans, 37%, report that the economy will make the Christmas holiday more stressful. Sixty-one percent of respondents said they had to cut back on their holiday donations this year due to the economy, according to the poll. That number is up from 2009, when 51% said they would be giving less to charity, and from 2010, when 58% said the same. Similarly, 62% of Americans said they were cutting back on their holiday gift giving this year. The economy looming large over the holiday season has become a trend since the economic downturn and recession of 2008. And this latest poll shows that even though 2013 brought welcome -- albeit slow -- economic growth, the recession still seems to have lingering effects on how Americans feel about Christmas. In 2005, before the economic downturn, nearly half of all Americans said that Christmas was a ""great time"" or ""the best time"" of year. In 2008, just months after the financial crisis hit, that number was down to 43%. And in the most recent poll, only 42% said Christmas was the best or great time of year -- a sign that Christmas spirit has yet to fully recover from the recession. What's more, this year a record low of 11% of people said Christmas was ""the best time"" of year. These numbers comes despite the fact that by looking at most objective economic indicators, the last year has seen positive economic growth -- including falling unemployment, growing gross domestic product and a soaring stock market. Even if Christmas giving and spending will be scaled back, the more than nine in 10 Americans who say they will celebrate Christmas this year, plan to celebrate the holiday differently. According to CNN's Polling Director Keating Holland, those who celebrate Christmas can be categorized in four different groups: . Twenty-five percent of Americans are in the ""Gung-Ho"" group, meaning they go all out for the holiday. This includes putting up Christmas trees, lights and other decorations outside their homes. They also consider Christmas the best time of the year, and according to other polls, they go to church weekly. Next are the 32% of people who look forward to celebrating the holiday but may not go all out. Members of this group -- the ""Ho-Ho-Ho"" -- are religious, according to other polls, but are not weekly church attendants. Twenty-three percent of Americans are ""Ho-Hum"" about Christmas, meaning while they like Christmas, they aren't wild about it. They likely don't decorate and they are the most likely group to limit what they eat during the holiday season. Only a quarter of this group attends church regularly, according to other polls. Lastly are the 16% of Americans who fall under the ""Bah, Humbug"" group. This group says the holiday season is a bad time of year for them and they don't spend much time or effort on the holiday. Only 6% of Americans said they will not be celebrating Christmas this year. The telephone survey of 1,035 people was conducted for CNN by ORC International on December 16-19. The poll has a sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.","State of economy playing big role in how Americans will celebrate holiday .

"(CNN) -- Even the most sordid situations can have a silver lining. The Michael Jackson-Conrad Murray relationship may serve as a cautionary tale for any health care provider who works with celebrities. Regardless of whether you agree with the verdict on Murray, who was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter Monday in Jackson's death, there is little doubt that what served as ""health care"" for Jackson would hardly meet quality standards, and some would characterize it as drug dealing. That all sorts of boundaries between patient and physician were crossed can hardly be disputed. What is it about caring for celebrities that causes professionals to lower their standards and often enable unhealthy behaviors? There are several factors: . --Health care providers are no different from anyone else. We live in a celebrity culture where the well-known are held in high regard, regardless of the nature of their talents. While often the interest is prurient, the curiosity surrounding these individuals can cause otherwise normal acting professionals to act in an unprofessional manner. --Celebrities are often narcissistic, demanding people who may make unreasonable demands on providers who may be intimidated or in awe of them. --Incurring the favoritism of a celebrity can increase the profile of a health care provider, leading to more ""business"" and more celebrity interactions from the friends and family of the celebrity. --The world that celebrities live in scarcely resembles the world most of us inhabit. They have private jets, personal shoppers, instant gratification for every need and the adoration of the public. It is hard not to be seduced by this ""Alice in Wonderland"" world. Many providers are thrilled to be included in the celebrity posse. --Quite simply, celebrities can offer money to those who can meet their demands, however unreasonable. --Which one of us would not want to be a fly on the wall witnessing the public adoration and posh lifestyle of the rich and famous? Reality shows are hugely popular just for this reason (along with their train wreck appeal). Becoming a contracted health care provider, such as Murray was for Jackson, allows the provider to accompany the celebrity on this magic carpet ride. Until the carpet crashes. --It is hard to say ""No"" to a celebrity who has never been denied. Most health professionals would swear they do not alter their standard of care for ""special"" patients and insist they treat all patients the same, without regard to status. In the main, I would agree this is the case. However, I have noticed in many different health care settings that when a celebrity is involved, waiting times are shortened, scarce specialty appointments are miraculously found, staff is just a little more polite and solicitous, and the entire unwieldy health care process is a little more user friendly. The wheels get greased. There are practical reasons for a health care institution to go out of its way for a celebrity: . It is good public relations. Celebrity endorsement of a doctor or hospital can help with image, fundraising and standing in the community. With the strict Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act guidelines protecting patient privacy, the public should never be aware of which doctor or institution is caring for a patient. However, the celebrity may choose to reveal this information out of gratitude. Celebrities can be wonderful partners in raising awareness for a disease or condition. Many choose to lend their drawing power to fundraising galas for disease research. There is, however, a clear line between facilitating a specialty visit for a celebrity and prescribing large amounts of unwarranted painkillers or sleeping medications. The boundary violations seen in Murray's case are so egregious that it boggles the mind. Very few providers have succumbed to celebrity neediness to this extent. A good outcome from this tragic tale would be a reminder to all care providers not to be seduced by the promise of entrÃ©e into the world of the rich and famous. Maintaining the same standard of care and caring for all patients, regardless of stature in life, is something we all profess but may need to be reminded to uphold. Celebrities should not get less care or more care or different care or even, heaven forbid, the crazy, diabolical pimping that goes on in these selective circles. Being an enabler for a celebrity, whether it be ""overcare,"" extortionist care ($100,000 a month?) or drug dealing is wrong. Hopefully, this Jackson-Murray chapter is closed; the cautionary tale has been written. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Victoria McEvoy.","Victoria McEvoy says Murray verdict a cautionary tale for docs who work with celebrities .
She asks: Why does dealing with celebrities make doctors lower standards?
She says doctors dazzled by glamor, money, access, like everyone else .

"(CNN) -- Suzanne Forman enters a swanky Los Angeles restaurant with Todd Grodnick, a blind date she's only spoken to on the phone. The two are among a growing number of baby boomers who are going online to date. ""I mean I can't believe I'm 55,"" Forman said. ""I feel like I'm still 20 or 30 or something. I still have the energy. I still have that spark. But I do have a lot of candles on my cake."" A study conducted for OurTime.com, a dating site catering to baby boomers, found unmarried people over 50 consider companionship more important now than they did during their 20s. But it's often difficult to find a good match through traditional connections such as friends and relatives. ""I was a vegetarian and one of the guys they set me up with took me to a Moroccan restaurant, and he ate raw meat in front of me, right next to me!"" Forman recalled. So Forman joined OurTime, which she said offers a ""candy store of people."" ""There has been a perfect storm ... of baby boomers who are single, with a growing number ... using the Internet and discovering that it's a way to be connected,"" said Dr. Gail Saltz, OurTime's relationship expert. Another customer is Staci Dansey, a 61-year-old Newport Beach, California, real estate agent. ""It's like my business, it's a numbers game. The more people I meet, the greater the odds that I will meet a guy who wants to have a loving, warm, serious, committed, monogamous relationship."" After her marriage ended, Dansey said her daughter and daughter-in-law suggested online dating, but she said she was reluctant because she had heard ""horror stories."" But dating sites say they offer much better protection against stalkers, scam artists and worse, because they collect background information on clients. A 2010 survey by eHarmony.com found the Internet is the most popular way for people over 50 to meet and marry. ""I've always thought the idea that the older generation is afraid of technology is overblown, because they now seem to adopt it, and adopt it in numbers just as much as everybody else does,"" said eHarmony's Dr. Gian Gionzaga. Vange LeClerc, a widow, and Rob Foss, a divorcÃ©, met through eHarmony in 2008. ""I had been married so long I had kind of forgotten the process,"" Foss said. ""I was like a duck out of water."" LeClerc conceded online dating was ""scary,"" but she said she found the process ""less intimidating than going out and meeting someone at a bar."" Now the baby boom couple plan to make their online match permanent, with a Hawaiian wedding next year.","Websites such as OurTime.com cater to singles over 50 .

"(CNN) -- If trials were predictable, they wouldn't happen. You can root for a jury to see a case your way and disagree with its ultimate verdict, but you cannot criticize the jury system for being unpredictable. In that sense, a Florida jury's recent verdicts -- and nonverdicts -- against Michael Dunn demonstrate a fundamental truth about trials. They are not only unpredictable; they are designed that way. The case against Dunn stemmed from an incident on November 23, 2012. Dunn, a 47-year-old white man, arrived at a gas station in Jacksonville, Florida, and parked next to an SUV that contained Davis and other black teenagers. When Dunn complained about loud music coming from the SUV, words were exchanged and Dunn ultimately fired a gun that killed Davis. Dunn said he saw a gun barrel pointing out of the SUV, but the prosecution said there was no gun. Dunn was found guilty of three counts of attempted second-degree murder as to the other occupants of the car, but the jury was not able to reach a verdict on the first-degree murder charge in the death of Jordan Davis. In the eyes of critics, this case was a ""sure thing"" for the prosecution, and anything less than guilty verdicts across the board is now considered by them to be a miscarriage of justice. Guilty verdicts were expected. That sentiment belies a fundamental misunderstanding about the criminal justice system: With juries, there is no such thing as a ""sure thing."" No one can accurately predict how each juror might perceive the evidence, argue a case in deliberations or be persuaded by his or her fellow jurors. Jurors can and do bring their own life experiences to the jury room, and no two jurors are the same. Yet anyone who has waited for a jury's verdict has engaged in the same helpless jury astrology because there is simply no hard science to predict their behavior. The best example is the rabid divination of the meaning of juror questions: those inscrutable, handwritten missives intermittently sent out to the judge and read to the lawyers in chambers. Tonyaa Weathersbee: An empty verdict, a hollow victory . This system is about as sophisticated as note-passing in grade-school algebra, but just a few lines from an innocuous jury inquiry will leave seasoned attorneys pondering the hidden meaning and the potential direction of the deliberations. The bottom line is this: Reading these tea leaves is an exercise in futility. There's no way to predict a verdict with certainty. To many observers, including me, this was a strong prosecution case, but not a sure thing. In fact, it's generally only the close-call cases that go to a jury. The most obvious cases of guilt or nonguilt should result in plea agreements or voluntary withdrawals by the prosecution. Simply look at the statistics. The vast majority of all cases, criminal and civil, are resolved before trial. Verdicts are simply too risky for either side, especially to put up a case that they believe is a loser. A jury trial means each side believes their theory of the case is strong enough to roll the dice in this riskiest game of all. Whether you agree with the jury's verdict or not, these verdicts give us some insight into the jury's thought process. The jury convicted on attempted second-degree murder for shots fired at the other passengers in the SUV with Davis. It makes sense. By Dunn's own concessions, he intentionally shot at a vehicle speeding away from him. Even if Dunn's testimony were completely believed, at best only Davis was the aggressor, so Dunn had a minimal self-defense claim against the other occupants. But, the verdict on attempted second-degree murder may have put a figurative ""cap"" on Dunn's level of intent. In other words, the jury may have agreed that Dunn's level of intent as to all victims was consistent -- perhaps not the specific intent to kill characteristic of a first-degree murder, but something slightly less. In the case of second-degree murder, this could be an intentional act so indifferent to human life it evinced a depraved mind. The ""depraved heart"" variety of murder is often analogized, coincidentally enough, to law students as closing your eyes and shooting into a crowd with a gun. It may be true that you did not actually intend to hit anyone, but the act was so likely to kill that your level of intent is just below that of specific, premeditated murder. That law school example used to explain the concept to students is eerily similar to the facts here. While it's possible that the jury was hung up trying to apply the law of self-defense, it may also be that the jury simply had trouble with the definitions of homicide. It's understandable. They are complicated for lawyers and lay persons alike. Florida's standard jury instructions are available online. Take a look at each of the suggested instructions for the different degrees of murder and manslaughter. They, like all jury instructions, are complicated. They do not get much less complicated just because the judge reads them slowly and out loud to the jury. They involve abstract concepts and seemingly overlapping definitions of nuanced ""states of mind."" It's very likely that the jury was hung up on whether self-defense applied, but they also may have deadlocked over the different definitions of homicide. Despite public frustrations, this was a win for the prosecution. It secured a successful verdict on four of five counts that will, because of Florida's minimum mandatory sentencing scheme and the defendant's use of a firearm, send Dunn to prison for at least 60 to 75 years. That's day-for-day: no gain time, no early release except for a win on appeal. Plus, the prosecution can retry Dunn for the killing of Davis. When a judge discharges a jury on the grounds that the jury cannot reach a verdict, the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution does not bar a new trial of the defendant. The double jeopardy clause provides: ""[N]or shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb in criminal ... cases."" If the state reprosecutes the Davis killing, Dunn will certainly feel as if he's being tried twice for the same crime. Constitutionally, however, a retrial following a deadlocked jury is permissible. Defense counsel deserves recognition as well. They hung a jury on what many observers expected to be a clear-cut murder conviction. Even without the wave of public acrimony against the defendant, this was always an uphill self-defense case. It was clear from the trial that the defense prepared this case and the client, and gave Dunn the best chance at a not-guilty verdict. Overall, a good job with bad facts for the defense. The big question now is whether we will see the state of Florida retry Dunn for the murder of Davis. On one hand, they have achieved a virtual life sentence on the other convictions, which achieves one of the philosophical goals of punishment: incapacitation and isolation of Dunn from the community. It does not achieve another goal of punishment for the Davis family: retribution. The state has indicated for now that it will retry Dunn, but if it does, one thing will remain certain: . There are no sure things in retrials, either. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Danny Cevallos.","Danny Cevallos: Critics of the Michael Dunn verdict miss a feature of trials .

"(CNN) -- Last week, Tom Perkins, who's becoming America's most controversial venture capitalist, suggested the very rich should get more votes than everyone else. In his ideal system, he said, ""it should be like a corporation. You pay a million dollars in taxes, you get a million votes. How's that?"" Well, un-American, for starters. But more on that in a minute. Perkins quickly indicated he wasn't being entirely serious, just as he'd backtracked after saying on another occasion that criticism of the 1% was akin to Nazi persecution of Jews. Apparently his pronouncements aren't to be taken literally; they're pleas for understanding from a brave member of a victimized minority group. Right. Yet Perkins has given us the gift of a great thought experiment. What if we took him literally and granted more votes to those who earn more? One dollar, one vote. It would seem antithetical to every notion of equal citizenship and fair play, and at odds with our constitutional ideal of one man, one vote. But in fact, the result would not look terribly different from today's political reality. As things stand, without even needing to implement what Perkins calls ""The Tom Perkins System,"" the wealthiest Americans already have grossly disproportionate voice in elections, campaign finance, lobbying and policy making. In the first place, let's consider the fact that we're paying attention to this civic crackpot even though he has no command of American social or political history, no appreciation for the multigenerational legacy of public investment that made his success possible, and no apparent empathy for anyone outside his rarefied circle. Why does he have a megaphone? Why do we listen? Because he's spectacularly rich. Someone else with such paltry qualifications as a citizen but without such massive net worth would be easy to ignore. In fact, you probably ignored someone just like that at a recent holiday dinner or office party. Perkins' offhand remarks already carry more weight in national discourse than, say, the many thousands of people who for months have been rallying for voting rights and social justice in the Moral Mondays rallies in North Carolina. They've struggled for coverage and attention. Perkins gets his free. Is that really democratic? Voting is perhaps the most visible indicator of our upside-down democracy. In the 2008 presidential election, turnout among voters making $150,000 or more (which isn't even the marker for the 1%; more like the 3%) was 78%. Turnout among voters making less than $15,000 was 41%. So, the rich cast ballots at twice the rate the poor do. Once we move beyond the actual casting of ballots, though, to the messier aspects of democracy and self-government, the gap widens dramatically. The poor do not donate, lobby or legislate. In fact, most in the shrinking middle class do not either. Consider political contributions. As researchers at the Sunlight Foundation showed in a recent report, in the 2012 election cycle, 31,000 individuals -- the ""1% of the 1%"" -- accounted for 28% of all campaign giving in the United States. What about their lobbyists? Here, too, the concentration of wealth in America, already reaching radical levels, is radically compounded. Only 894 lobbyists accounted for $34 million in donations in 2012, and they spread their gifts strategically to gain access to candidates and to influence policy making. This is why the rules of the game in today's system already massively compound the advantages that the wealthy have in life. It's why our tax system bends to favor capital and punish work. Dividends and ""carried interest"" are taxed at lower rates than earned income not because these preferences are shown to benefit society at large but because the hedge fund managers and venture capitalists who do benefit from them have excellent representation in Congress. In short, the outrage is not what a Tom Perkins says out loud; the outrage is that we already have something like the system he fancifully, condescendingly proposes. Policy wonks and heroic citizen activists have all proposed reforms. We don't lack possible remedies. What we've lacked is the will to force our government to enact them. And this is why the outrageous self-justifications of an imperious hyper-elite are, perversely, very helpful now. The game is rigged. Having the likes of Tom Perkins rub our faces in it may be insult enough to awaken us. He suggests giving big money even more political power. Imagine a movement going the other way. Imagine a concerted citizen effort to double voter registration and turnout among poor and working Americans. Imagine cross-partisan collaborations between right and left to curb crony capitalism. Let's not kid ourselves: It wouldn't be easy to unrig the game and revive the principle of equal citizenship. But let's not kid ourselves about this fact either: The rich already have more votes than the rest of us. The only question is whether we will continue to tolerate it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Eric Liu.","Eric Liu: Tom Perkins' joking suggestion about giving rich more votes is not far from truth .

"(CNN) -- In the last few months Iranians have found themselves in a cyber no-man's land. Many are reporting international websites and online services, including Gmail and Skype, are often blocked and circumvention tools effectively squashed, making it difficult to communicate with anyone outside the country. National websites are still easily accessed, but as internet speeds slow to a crawl, many of the country's netizens are finding access to even the most rudimentary URLs barred -- including those belonging to banks and local businesses. With the country's presidential election less than two weeks away, many experts find the timing of the latest apparent restrictions significant. ""Every time you get close to an important event, like the election, the internet goes down,"" says Ali Bangi, co-director of Toronto-based organization ASL19, which provides tools for Iranians to circumvent government filters. Amanpour explains Iranian elections . Before the 2009 elections, he notes, the regime appeared to focus mainly on censoring foreign news and social media sites. Iranians easily bypassed these controls using VPN software, which makes it look like users are accessing sites from a separate country. Lately, he says, it seems the government has become more sophisticated with its filters. Since March, VPNs have been blocked, making it harder for Iranians to access foreign URLs. In addition, encrypted international websites, such as Google and any site with ""https"" in front of its address, have been made so painstakingly slow that they are virtually unusable. The idea, says Bangi, is to push users to adopt the higher-speed national internet network, which some have dubbed the ""halal internet"" -- halal meaning permissible under Islamic law. It acts essentially as a giant intranet allowing the authorities more power to monitor web activity and restrict access to websites. Lately Twitter has been awash with grievances from Iranians who bemoan the various implications of the new blocks. Some have complained of increased workloads, friction with employers and general impositions to their everyday professional lives. Those that have managed to access the site (much fewer of late, says Bangi) frequently use it as an outlet to share circumvention tips, and vent their frustration. Tweets are often punctuated with #filternet -- the nickname many have given to the state's cyber blocks. Read more: Has Iran learned from 2009 elections . K, a network administrator for a software development company (he declined to use his full name to avoid drawing the attention of the Iranian government) estimates his workload has increased by an extra two hours each day as he attempts to work around government controls. ""Keep in mind that I'm an expert, and can usually find a workaround. I'd imagine it's a much bigger number for others,"" he says. He adds that the apparent state blocks have put a strain on his company's relationship with clients, as stalled access to email has made it difficult to keep up a timely communication. ""We're a software company, so we really rely on the internet. These restrictions have made our clients very unhappy. We haven't lost one yet, but who knows?"" According to K, the filters are not as sophisticated as they could be and even the most rudimentary local sites -- such as those related to banks -- occasionally find themselves blocked. ""Our company uses internet banking services, and the finance department has had difficulty paying staff,"" he says. Collin Anderson, an American researcher who has been mapping the emergence of Iran's national network, notes that often, those affected aren't necessarily anti-regime. ""What you see in social media is frustration and desperation,"" says Anderson. ""People are saying, 'look, I'm not political. I'm just a student trying to submit my Ph.D. thesis to my professor, and I can't, because my Gmail doesn't work'. There's a real human toll that's hard to asses based on economics."" Read more: Iran's cartoonist find new lines of expression . According to Bangi, since 2009, ISPs have been required to report ""forbidden"" content to the authorities under the Cyber Crimes Bill. In addition, accessing blocked sites was criminalized, so that any Iranian reading or disseminating material the government deems inflammatory could face penalties. Anderson notes there has been a considerable rise in malware and phishing attempts directed at anyone deemed anti-regime, and while he cannot prove it, he suspects the Iranian authorities are the ones responsible. He recalls receiving an email that tried to lure him into divulging his Gmail username and password. ""I set up a fake account to see what would happen, and within 24 hours, someone tried to log in and download all my emails, then sent out an email to my contacts trying to trick them into downloading the malware,"" he says. The purpose, he suspects, is to give authorities information. CNN reached out to the Iranian authorities to comment on the claimed use of malware, internet blocks and phishing attacks but received no reply. Last week the U.S. Department of State said that it will allow the export to Iran of ""certain services, software and hardware incident to personal communication in Iran."" ""As the Iranian government attempts to silence its people by cutting off their communication with each other and the rest of the world, the United States will continue to take action to help the Iranian people exercise their universal human rights, including the right to freedom of expression,"" it was announced in a press statement on May 31. Anderson isn't optimistic the filters will lift, as they've done in the past. ""You might see a slight relaxation of controls after the elections are over -- some of the throttling, which is really distressful, might let up -- but the sites that are blocked will remain blocked. Now that the state sees it can get away with it, these filters are here to stay.""","In the lead up to Iran's election, the state has made the internet nearly unusable for many of its citizens .
Usually Iranians use VPN software to bypass government controls, but lately, these too have been blocked .
Some fear the government is unleashing malware and phishing software to spy on Iranian citizens .

"(CNN) -- If you are one of the lucky many to have received a new tablet or smartphone over the holidays, congratulations! You'll want to rip open the box and start playing right away. But before you do something potentially distracting like downloading Dots, here are some starter tips to make the most of your new device, whether it's an iPad Mini, Nexus 5 smartphone or Kindle Fire HDX. Prevent heartbreak with security measures . Your new gadget is shiny and amazing and already precious to you. So it might be hard to imagine a dark day in the future when you are careless enough to leave it in the airplane seat pocket in front of you or unlucky enough to have it stolen. Bad things will happen, but there are a few steps you can take now to make it hurt a little less down the line. First, turn on the screen-lock setting which will require a passcode or password (or fingerprint or face recognition) every time you turn on the phone or tablet. This is your number one defense against someone accessing sensitive financial and personal information if they find or steal your device. It will also make it more difficult for them to wipe it and erase any information you didn't back up. Logging in every time will seem like a slight inconvenience at first, but after a few days you'll hardly notice you're doing it and the few seconds will become a forgotten routine. Next, download or activate any lost-device location features so that you can track the physical location of your tablet or phone if it is lost or stolen. Apple products have Find my iPhone installed by default, but you must connect your device to an iCloud account. Android devices can use the Android Device Manager. Make a backup plan . Whether you end up using your tablet or smartphones primarily for communication, enjoying content like movies and books, or creating original content like drawings and work documents, you'll want to back up your device. You can go through the default backup tools, such as iCloud or iTunes on iOS 7 or the Backup & Reset settings on Android. Third-party apps can also come in handy, like Dropbox, Titanium Backup or Carbon. When possible, use individual apps that automatically sync anything you create to the cloud. Get a case . A new gadget's pristine screen and body are so pretty to look at, so gloriously unscuffed and unsullied. You may think it would be a shame to hide its glory under some cheap plastic case. You know what's worse? Living with a broken and scratched device that cost hundreds of dollars. It happens far too often. Just look around your local coffee shop and count the number of people working around a cracked screen, dragging their bleeding or calloused fingers over fractured glass held together with clear packaging tape. If you're clumsy or have children or are prone to the forces of gravity, consider buying a case. Save money . The first bill on a new mobile device can be a shocker when you easily breeze past your data limit or rack up roaming charges. If your device is on a cellular plan, take precautions and set a mobile data warning or limit to prevent you from going over. The option is under Settings ->Wireless & Networks -> Data Usage on Android devices. If you're using an Apple device, you can monitor how much data your device is eating up under Settings -> Cellular -> System Services (at the very bottom of the page). It groups data usage by the type of service like Mapping Services and Exchange Accounts. If you deduce a specific app is sucking down the most data, you can revoke its ability to use cellular data here too. You can also install third-party apps to monitor data usage, some of which break it down by individual apps. Video and music streaming apps are big data hogs, so make sure you're on a wireless network before binge watching House of Cards. If texting or calling charges are a concern, download calling and messaging apps that work over WiFi like Skype, What's App and Viber. Delete the junk . Fresh out of the box, many devices are set up to favor their creators' or carriers' preferred apps. The problem is especially bad with Android and Windows phones sold through third-party carriers, which like to preinstall all sorts of bloatware. Go through and delete any promotional or unwanted apps right away. If you can't delete the app on Android, you can probably disable it in settings so that it is out of sight. Apple devices are more conservative with preinstalled apps, but there is a core group of iOS apps you can't uninstall. If you really don't want to use them, stash them away in a folder. This is also the time to make some cosmetic adjustments, like picking a new wallpaper and organizing your apps, so that you don't have to readjust to a new layout later. Prone to motion-sickness? Switch off the parallax setting on iOS 7. Download starter apps . While not junk, some of the default apps might not be the best option for you. For example, Apple's Maps app, while vastly improved over its original buggy version, still isn't as good as Google Maps, which can be downloaded from the App Store (Google makes a number of must-have apps for iOS 7). There are a host of weather, calendar, note-taking, and camera alternatives to test out before setting down with the defaults. Hunting for and downloading new apps is the most exciting part of a new gadget. Start with the basics, like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. If you're a news junkie, get the apps for your favorite outlets, any local channels or publications, and your favorite news aggregation app. Keep yourself organized with Evernote, and if you're part of a couple, download Avocado (if not for the sweet private messaging stuff, than because it's a handy way to coordinate to-do lists). If you are a subscriber to any video or music streaming services, download the mobile apps (Netflix, Pandora, Amazon Instant, Hulu, Spotify). If you've already started anthropomorphizing your iPhone or iPad, just go all the way and download Hatch. Here are suggestions of apps for travelers, apps for weathering storms and apps for staying healthy. If you have kids . You may start out telling yourself you won't let the children play with your tablet or smartphone, but it only takes one twitchy toddler in a nice restaurant to kill that dream. If your device has parental controls, set them up early to prevent any unwanted app purchases, work emails or cryptic Facebook postings. If you are going to record a video . Make sure your device is horizontal. Vertically shot movies are a plague that must be stopped. If you're replacing an old tablet or phone . Don't forget to wipe your old device completely before handing it down, selling it on Craigslist, or donating it to a local charity.","New mobile device?

"(CNN) -- Red Bull has enjoyed complete dominance over Formula One for the past four years but as the 2014 season approaches, is that about to change? The all-conquering team and its four-time world championship-winning driver Sebastian Vettel have endured a less-than-satisfactory preseason testing period. The marque, which has also won the constructors' championship four years in a row, completed fewer laps in preseason than any other team apart from Lotus -- which missed three of the four tests. ""Right now, nothing is lost -- no race has been run, no point has been allocated -- but when I listen to some media we are right in the middle of a huge disaster,"" Vettel told Formula One's official website after the final test event in Bahrain at the weekend as he outlined the case for the Red Bull defense. ""There is massive hype and most people don't know what they are talking about,"" added Vettel. ""Yes, sometimes you make mistakes, but there is no team in the paddock who can say that they can run a day without any issues. Despite Red Bull's struggles, Vettel insisted it would be foolish to write off the team's chances ahead of the season-opening Australian Grand Prix on March 16. ""True there are some that have had less than we have, but we will fight through it. Everybody in the team -- including me -- is ready to fight,"" added the German. ""We have been growing together to such an extent that we are strong enough to dive through tough times."" What has made this preseason so challenging is the raft of rule changes brought into the sport for 2014. F1's hulking V8 engines have been consigned to the scrapheap and replaced by hybrid 1.6-liter V6 models, while fuel and weight limits have also been imposed. Interactive: F1 rips up the rulebook . The move away from the loud V8s is a development that concerns F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone, who is worried the sport may lose some of its drama through the subsequent noise reduction. ""I'm not at all happy with the sound of the new engines, to be honest,"" Ecclestone recently told CNN. ""It doesn't sound like F1, but that's my opinion, let's wait and see what the public think."" If Red Bull is under pressure ahead of the Melbourne curtain-raiser, then Mercedes will be looking forward to it with relish. The German manufacturer, which finished second in the team standings in 2013, had a fruitful time in Bahrain, with 2008 world champion Lewis Hamilton setting the pace on Sunday. ""We are driven to fight for the championship -- that all is super positive,"" said Hamilton after an encouraging day at the Bahrain International Circuit. ""But let's keep the feet on the ground: right now -- even if all indications look great -- it is still difficult to know who is hot and who is not. ""You go to Australia not knowing who the hell will be in the lead. Reliability will be a huge factor -- for every single person in the team. For everyone."" Hamilton is anticipating a start similar to the 2012 season -- when seven different drivers won the first seven races of the year -- with a number of teams jostling for early-season honors. ""It could easily be like that,"" said the 29-year-old Briton. ""Fortunately the Mercedes is such a good engine: you have Williams, who look like they could be a competitive team, and you have Force India who could be much further ahead. ""Maybe Felipe Massa will take the Williams to the front! Who knows?"" Brazilian Massa is a new arrival at Williams after eight years at Ferrari and he's made a promising start to his career with the British team. The Brazilian set the fastest lap time of the weekend on Saturday, while his rookie teammate Valtteri Bottas was also near the top of the timesheets in fourth position. ""The team has done a great job and thank you also to Mercedes-Benz (Williams' engine supplier),"" Finland's Bottas told the team's official website. ""We still need to work very hard in these next two weeks but I overall I'm happy with how testing has gone for us. ""I am looking forward to picking up where we left off when we get to Melbourne.""","Red Bull completed fewer preseason testing laps than any other team apart from Lotus .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Comic actor Harvey Korman has died at 81, according to the UCLA Medical Center. Harvey Korman's death comes after complications from the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Korman died at the center four months after suffering complications from the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. ""It was a miracle in itself that he survived the incident at all. Everyone in the hospital referred to him as 'miracle man' because of his strong will and ability to bounce right back after several major operations,"" said Korman's daughter, Kate Korman. ""Tragically, after such a hard-fought battle, he passed away."" Korman was a regular on ""The Carol Burnett Show"" from 1967 through 1978, for which he won Emmy awards in 1969, 1971, 1972 and 1974. He also won a Golden Globe for his work on the series. The lanky Korman also appeared in Mel Brooks' ""Blazing Saddles"" (as the sneering Hedley Lamarr), ""High Anxiety"" and ""History of the World, Part 1."" He starred in his own short-lived situation comedy, ""The Harvey Korman Show,"" in 1978, in which he portrayed Harvey Kavanaugh opposite Christine Lahti, who played his wife, Maggie. He made dozens of appearances in other television shows and movies during his lengthy show-business career, including providing voices for several animated productions. Among those was The Great Gazoo, a helmeted space man who appeared in some episodes of ""The Flintstones."" Angie Horejsi, an assistant to Burnett, told The Associated Press that Burnett was devastated by Korman's death: ""She loved Harvey very much,"" Horejsi said. The AP also reported that Brooks described Korman as a ""dazzling"" comic talent. ""You could get rock-solid comedy out of him. He could lift the material. He always made it real, always made it work, always believed in characters he was doing,"" he said, according to AP. Korman was born in Chicago, Illinois. His first marriage, to Donna Ehlert in 1960, ended in divorce in 1974. He married Deborah Fritze in 1982. Both marriages produced two children. Korman landed some sketch work on ""The Red Skelton Show"" in 1961, followed by a four-year stint on ""The Danny Kaye Show,"" which led to his joining Carol Burnett in 1967. In addition to his wife and daughter, Korman is survived by three other adult children -- Laura, Maria and Chris -- and three grandchildren.","""Carol Burnett Show"" regular won Emmy awards, Golden Globe for work on series .

"Rome (CNN) -- Video showing a naked man being sprayed by an aid worker, apparently as part of a medical treatment and in full view of other migrants on the Italian island of Lampedusa, has sparked outrage in Europe. The secretly filed cellphone footage, aired on Italian state television channel RAI, shows a worker at a migrant center spraying the man while others wait for what officials said was a medical treatment designed to prevent a contagious skin condition called scabies. While the camp manager told CNN on Wednesday that the video is misleading, the Speaker for Italy's lower house of Parliament, Laura Boldrini, said in a post on the body's Facebook page that the reported treatment of migrants was ""degrading"" and ""not worthy of a civilized country."" ""Those images cannot leave us indifferent,"" said Boldrini, who was the spokeswoman for several years for the U.N. refugee agency in Rome. She said efforts would be made to find those responsible and hold them accountable. The Italian Interior Ministry ordered an inquiry Tuesday and said it expected a report from the local authorities within 24 hours. EU Home Affairs Commissioner Cecilia Malstrom condemned the images -- reportedly shot by a migrant at the camp -- as ""appalling and unacceptable."" She said the European Commission would ask the Italian authorities to ""shed full light"" over what had happened. ""We have already started investigations on the deplorable conditions in many Italian detention centers, including Lampedusa, and we will not hesitate to launch an infringement procedure to make sure EU standards and obligations are fully respected,"" she said in a statement Wednesday. ""Our assistance and support to the Italian authorities in managing migratory flows can only be continued if the country guarantees humane and dignified reception conditions to migrants, asylum seekers and refugees."" Camp Manager Cono Gallipo told CNN Wednesday that accusations that camp staff were humiliating migrants were offensive. ""We are aware of what the video shows,"" Gallipo said. ""But that is not exactly how things work and what really happened."" Usually, he said, migrants are given a preventative treatment for scabies inside showers contained in an enclosed cabin where greater privacy can be afforded. They are then given clean clothes to wear, Gallipo said. But he said on the day the video was shot, which he said was December 13, migrants tired of standing in line began removing their clothes before getting inside the cabin. Some asked for the treatment to be done in the open to speed up the process. ""In retrospect we should have stopped the treatment that day,"" he said. ""But at the prospect of either hypothetically breaching the law for omitting to give health assistance to a refugee or hypothetically breaching his/her right to privacy, I opted for the second one."" Shipwreck deaths . Lampedusa made global headlines when more than 300 African migrants died after their ship sank off its shores on October 3. Days later, another 34 people died when their boat capsized. Hundreds more have been rescued from often unseaworthy vessels and taken to the tiny Mediterranean island's overcrowded detention center. As the closest Italian island to Africa, Lampedusa is a frequent destination for refugees seeking to enter European Union countries and shipwrecks off its shores are common. Many of the migrants are from African nations, while others have fled war-torn Syria, officials say. The Italian coast guard told CNN in September that there were some 1,250 migrants in residence, in a space designed for 250. In the wake of the October tragedy, the U.N. refugee agency called on Italy urgently to renovate the Lampedusa detention center. The agency's Rome-based representative, Laurens Jolles, said the center's capacity had been reduced from 850 to 250 by a fire in 2011 and had yet to be restored. ""The serious degradation of the reception center, with entire families forced to sleep in the open when it rains, is absolutely unacceptable,"" he said. He described conditions and services there as below European Union standards and urged Italy to speed up the transfer of migrants and asylum seekers to better equipped centers on the mainland. CNN's Hada Messia reported from Rome and Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported in London. CNN's Marilia Brocchetto contributed to this report.","NEW: Camp manager says video is misleading, rejects claims migrants were degraded .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The U.S. Defense Department accidentally shipped ballistic missile components to Taiwan, the Pentagon said Tuesday. A U.S. Defense Department image shows the missile components it says were accidentally shipped to Taiwan. Four nose-cone fuses for intercontinental ballistic missiles were shipped instead of the helicopter batteries that Taiwan had requested, Air Force Secretary Michael Wynne said. The fuses were shipped to Taiwan in fall 2006 and kept in a warehouse there. The Taiwanese military informed the United States last week about their presence on the island. ""There are no nuclear or fissile materials associated with these items,"" Wynne said. ""The United States is making all appropriate notifications in the spirit of candor and openness in an effort to avoid any misunderstanding.""  Watch Wynne describe the fuses » . An investigation is under way, he added.  Watch how missile parts ended up in Taiwan » . Ryan Henry, principal deputy undersecretary of defense for policy, said, ""In an organization as large as DOD, the largest and most complex in the world, there will be mistakes. But they cannot be tolerated in the arena in strategic systems, whether they are nuclear or only associated equipment, as was in this case."" Henry said the parts were 1960s technology, designed for use with Minuteman ballistic missiles. Officials said China, which considers Taiwan to be a renegade province, has been notified about the mistake. The Chinese government did not immediately issue a response to the news. Wynne said the missile components were first shipped from F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming to Hill Air Force Base in Utah in 2005. On arrival at Hill, they should have been placed in the classified storage section, Wynne said, but instead were moved to a storage area for unclassified items. He said stocks at the Utah base should be checked quarterly and a key part of the investigation will be determining how those checks did not turn up the missile parts before they were shipped to Taiwan. It is the second nuclear-related mistake involving the Air Force in less than a year. In August, a B-52 bomber mistakenly carried six nuclear warheads from North Dakota to Louisiana. A six-week investigation uncovered a ""lackadaisical"" attention to detail in day-to-day operations at the air bases involved. The Air Force said it relieved four officers, including three colonels, and other personnel lost their certification to handle sensitive weaponry.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Brittany Murphy's mother attacked the ""Clueless"" actress' father for suggesting their daughter died from poisoning. The controversy began last week with a lab report suggesting that the presence of 10 heavy metals in a strand of her hair was evidence of a poisoning death four years ago. A forensic pathologist told CNN last week that the poisoning conclusion was ""ridiculous"" and ""baseless."" It's erupted into a public name-calling battle this week between Murphy's father, who sent the hair strand to a private lab for testing, and her mother, who wrote a scathing response published Monday in The Hollywood Reporter . ""I have no choice now but to come forward in the face of inexcusable efforts to smear my daughter's memory by a man who may be her biological father but was never a real father to her in her lifetime,"" Sharon Murphy wrote. She said Angelo Bertolotti's claims ""are based on the most flimsy of evidence and are more of an insult than an insight into what really happened."" Murphy accused Bertolotti of trying to profit off his daughter's death with the publicity surrounding the poisoning reports even though he hadn't seen her in the last three years of her life. ""They want to do a documentary and write a book, and this whole stunt is merely publicity to fuel their aspirations,"" she said, referring to Bertolotti and a partner. Her father was not part of her life past her first year, she said. ""He certainly wasn't around during the 12 years he spent in prison on three criminal felony convictions. Throughout her childhood, I was Brittany's only parent and sole support."" Murphy's father, in a response to CNN, said the mother's ""ghostwritten piece is riddled with mistakes."" ""I am at the very end of my life,"" he told CNN Monday. ""Money means absolutely nothing to me."" It's Sharon Murphy, not him, who has used the death to make money by starting a foundation and announcing a book, Bertolotti said. ""I have nothing to gain here, while Sharon has lived a life of luxury. Before Brittany supported (still does) her mother, I was supporting Sharon."" He disputed Sharon Murphy's claim that their daughter chose not to have contact with him when she was a child and later as an adult. Sharon Murphy and Bertolotti divorced three decades ago. ""How is it that I am pictured with my daughter in her childhood and adulthood, if she supposedly cut me off in childhood?"" Bertolotti said. ""I have a normal and close relationship with all of my children and they are open about that. There has never been a 12 year gap in the photos of Brittany and myself. I have quite a few of them online."" The Los Angeles County coroner ruled pneumonia killed Murphy, 32, in December 2009, and that her husband, Simon Monjack, 39, died from the same illness five months later. The similarities between their deaths -- in the same bedroom of their Hollywood Hills home -- prompted a search for answers beyond natural illness. ""It's very suspicious,"" Bertolotti told HLN last Tuesday. ""I feel she was poisoned and there's no question about that. She was murdered."" He said he had a murder suspect in mind, but declined to elaborate. ""I do, but I'd rather not speak about that."" CNN obtained the report by forensic toxicologist Ernest Lykissa, who concluded that the hair from the back of Murphy's head had higher than recommended levels of 10 heavy metals. ""If we were to eliminate the possibility of a simultaneous accidental heavy metals exposure to the sample donor then the only logical explanation would be an exposure to these metals (toxins) administered by a third party perpetrator with likely criminal intent."" Lykissa, who operates a toxicology testing lab in Deer Park, Texas, did not respond to several calls from CNN to discuss his findings. The director of forensic medicine at the University of Florida, who is also the president of the American Board of Forensic Toxicology, reviewed the lab report for CNN and was very critical. ""It's ridiculous,"" Dr. Bruce Goldberger said. A conclusion of poisoning is an ""inflammatory statement"" that ""is a baseless allegation and outrageous statement to make based on a single hair test."" Murphy's autopsy revealed no physical signs of poisoning, he said. ""A hair test alone, without any clinical signs or symptoms, cannot be used to establish poisoning."" The private report also showed a normal level of arsenic, which would have been elevated if rat poisoning was involved, he said. ""She was a beautiful woman and likely had numerous hair treatments,"" Goldberger said. ""Chemicals in the hair treatment would alter the chemistry of her hair sample."" Sharon Murphy said she also consulted with forensic experts who discredited the lab results. ""This report conveniently ignores what any good scientist will tell you: A hair sample can be affected by many outside factors, including hair dye, hair spray, prescription medications, foods, smoking the occasional cigarette and environmental factors,"" she wrote. The Los Angeles coroner ""has no plans to reopen the inquiries into the deaths of Miss Murphy or Mr. Monjack,"" Craig Harvey, the chief of operations for the coroner, said last week. ""We stand by by our conclusions and opinion."" Murphy's mother said she suspects a toxic mold found in the house may have killed her daughter and son-in-law. ""There were no indicators that it was from mold,"" Los Angeles County Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter told CNN in July 2010. ""We will never know for sure,"" Sharon Murphy wrote in Monday's story. ""However, we do know the Los Angeles County Coroner did extensive tests and found that she died of natural causes."" Monjack's autopsy concluded that his May 23, 2010, death was caused by acute pneumonia and severe anemia, ""just like Brittany,"" Winter said. Murphy died December 20, 2009, from a combination of pneumonia, an iron deficiency and multiple drug intoxication, a coroner said. The drugs involved were legal and are used to treat respiratory infections, according to an autopsy. Monjack, a British screenwriter, married Murphy in 2007. She was an often bubbly, free-spirited actress who appeared in films such as ""Clueless,"" ""8 Mile,"" ""Don't Say a Word"" and ""Girl, Interrupted."" She also lent her voice to animated works, including the movie ""Happy Feet"" -- in which she also sang -- and a regular role on the animated TV series ""King of the Hill.""","Mother calls claim Brittany Murphy was poisoned a publicity stunt by her father .

"(CNN) -- George Jones, the country music legend whose graceful, evocative voice gave depth to some of the greatest songs in country music -- including ""She Thinks I Still Care,"" ""The Grand Tour"" and ""He Stopped Loving Her Today"" -- has died, according to his public relations firm. Jones, 81, died Friday at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, the public relations firm said. He had been hospitalized since April 18 with fever and irregular blood pressure. Jones' career was marked by a tumultuous marriage to Tammy Wynette and bouts with alcoholism that led to occasional concert cancellations. (One of his nicknames was ""No-Show Jones""; after he got clean, he puckishly used ""No-Show"" on his license plates.) But there was no denying his talent. Waylon Jennings once wrote a song that said, ""George might show up flyin' high, if George shows up at all/But he may be, unconsciously, the greatest of them all."" Famous friends chimed in after learning of his death. ""My friend, the greatest singer of all time, has passed,"" Brad Paisley wrote on Twitter. ""To those who knew him, our lives were full. To those of you who don't: discover him now."" In a statement, Merle Haggard said, ""The world has lost the greatest country singer of all time. Amen."" Jones, nicknamed ""The Possum"" for his resemblance to the animal, was born in 1931 in east Texas. His early life was marked by poverty and a violent, alcoholic father. Young George taught himself to play guitar, and by the time he was a teenager he was singing on the streets and in the clubs of Beaumont, Texas, not far from his birthplace of Saratoga. Stars react to his death . After a quick marriage and service in the Marines, Jones was discovered by Starday Records co-owner Pappy Daily, who guided his early career. Jones' first single, 1954's ""No Money in This Deal,"" failed to chart, but 1955's ""Why, Baby, Why"" was a hit. By 1959, Jones had moved to Nashville and recorded his first No. 1, ""White Lightning."" Jones' early hits, such as ""Lightning,"" ""The Race Is On"" and ""Root Beer,"" were in a high-powered, rockabilly mode, but he found his biggest success as a crooner. Ensuing years were marked by such songs as ""Things Have Gone to Pieces"" and ""A Good Year for the Roses,"" which highlighted broken or thwarted romance and the kind of longing that suggests late, lonely nights in bars. It was a life that Jones started knowing all too well. His second marriage, to Shirley Corley, was marked by frequent benders. Jones recalled one that became legend: He had been drunk for several days, and Corley hid the keys to all of their cars. However, he pointed out, she'd forgotten one vehicle: their lawnmower. They lived eight miles from a liquor store but that didn't stop Jones. ""I imagine the top speed for that old mower was five miles per hour,"" he recalled in his 1996 memoir, ""I Lived to Tell It All."" ""It might have taken an hour and a half or more for me to get to the liquor store, but get there I did."" Share your memories of Jones . Jones and Corley divorced in 1968. A year later, he married Wynette, one of Nashville's biggest names. The two had a number of huge hits together, but the strain of their marriage was indicated in song titles such as their ""We're Gonna Hold On"" and the Jones solo song ""We Can Make It."" (One of Wynette's singles was called ""Kids Say the Darnedest Things""; one of those ""things"" was ""I want a divorce."") ""By now, the couple's marriage was becoming a public soap opera, with their audience following each single as if they were news reports,"" wrote CMT.com in its Jones biography. Wynette filed for divorce in 1973, reconsidered and then filed again two years later. This time it stuck. However, though the couple were divorced, they continued to sing together for years afterward. Wynette died in 1998. Jones' life went into a tailspin. He started using cocaine and missing shows more frequently, 54 in 1979 alone, according to CMT.com. His weight dropped from 150 to 100 pounds. He entered rehab but left after a month. And yet at this time he recorded perhaps his greatest song, 1980's ""He Stopped Loving Her Today,"" the tale of a man who continued pining for his lost love many years after she left him. The song, written by Bobby Braddock and Curly Putman, has been voted the greatest country song of all time in a Country Music Magazine poll. Jones continued to struggle in the early '80s -- once leading police on a car chase in Nashville -- but with the help of his fourth wife, Nancy Sepulvado, he got clean. Though his hit-making slowed down, mainly thanks to changing tastes in country music, he became a revered elder statesman, often credited as an influence by generations that followed. He paid tribute to his own and preceding generations in a 1985 hit, ""Who's Gonna Fill Their Shoes."" Other singers stood up for Jones. At the Country Music Association Awards in 1999, Jones was asked to shorten his hit song ""Choices."" He refused and boycotted the honors. But at the awards, Alan Jackson cut his own song short and went into ""Choices,"" giving Jones his due. ""Not everybody needs to sound like a George Jones record,"" Jackson once said in an interview, according to The New York Times. ""But that's what I've always done."" His singing remains a model. ""There aren't words in our language to describe the depth of his greatness,"" Vince Gill said in a statement. ""I'll miss my kind and generous friend."" Jones, a member of the Country Music Hall of Fame, was honored by the Kennedy Center in 2008 and received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2012.

"New York (CNN) -- Planned Parenthood of New York City blasted the city's new Teen Pregnancy Prevention Campaign on Thursday, saying it won't deter teen pregnancy and inappropriately shames and stigmatizes its target audience. The campaign ""creates stigma, hostility and negative public opinions about teen pregnancy and parenthood rather than offering alternative aspirations for young people,"" said Haydee Morales, the organization's vice president of education and training. ""The city's money would be better spent helping teens access health care, birth control and high-quality sexual and reproductive health education, not on an ad campaign intended to create shock value."" The New York City Human Resources Administration/Department of Social Services announced the $400,000 initiative, which features pictures of babies delivering messages to their hypothetical parents such as ""Honestly, mom... chances are he won't stay with you. What happens to me?"" The small print adds that 90% of teen parents don't marry each other. ""Dad, you'll be paying to support me for the next 20 years,"" says another of the ads, which adds in smaller print that ""NY State law requires a parent to pay child support until a child is 21."" ""Got a good job? I cost thousands of dollars each year,"" says another, which adds that teen parents should expect to spend more than $10,000 a year to raise their child. ""Teens giving birth before they are ready to provide emotional and financial support is not a good way to raise children,"" said Administration Commissioner Robert Doar. ""We cannot dictate how people live their lives, and sometimes even the best plans don't work out, but we must encourage responsibility and send the right message, especially to young people."" Planned Parenthood, an advocacy group and provider of reproductive health services and education, said Wednesday in a statement that the ads propagate stereotypes and fail to address the societal problems that lead to teen pregnancies. A city spokeswoman defended the ads, calling them but one part of a larger initiative that will include an interactive texting and social media campaign and a YouTube video public service announcement. ""This campaign is part of the city's comprehensive teen pregnancy prevention program, which includes sex education, increased access to birth control and partnerships with community-based organizations,"" said Samantha Levine, deputy press secretary for Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The city runs a school-based education program in which teen mothers and fathers discuss with peers the challenges of raising a child. A state-run family planning benefit program covers reproductive and sexual health care, including contraceptives, to low-income teens and adults. And a citywide relationship abuse prevention program lays out the consequences of teen pregnancy and how to avoid peer pressure and coercion. Since 2011, the city has mandated comprehensive sex education in public schools. The city's pregnancy rate for females has dropped by 27% over the past decade, but it is still higher than the national average, according to the mayor's office, which launched the campaign on Monday. ""Daughters of teen parents are more likely to become teen mothers themselves, while sons are more likely to go to prison,"" it said in a statement. ""On the other hand, parents who finish high school, find full- time work and get married before having children have a 98% chance of not living in poverty."" Planned Parenthood said that it supports the initiatives and recognizes the importance of awareness and education, but added that the rate of teen pregnancies is affected by economic and societal factors such as poverty, violence, limited access to health care, as well as gender, racial and ethnic inequalities. ""Teenage parenthood is simply not the disastrous and life-compromising event these ads portray,"" it said. ""It's time we focus on the root causes rather than point fingers at teen parents and their children."" Last year, Bloomberg pledged a $250,000 matching gift to the Planned Parenthood Federation of America after the Susan G. Komen for the Cure foundation cut off grants to Planned Parenthood for breast cancer screenings. The foundation later reversed its decision. According to data compiled by the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy in its 2012 publication, ""Why It Matters: Teen Childbearing, Education, and Economic Wellbeing,"" roughly 48% of mothers ages 15 to 19 lived below the poverty line. As their children grow up, their likelihood of living in poverty increases according to Jessica Sheets Pika, a spokeswoman for the organization. Some 41% of women who gave birth before 20 were living in poverty within the first year of their child's birth, while the chances of living in poverty rose to 50% when their child reached 3, Pika said.","Ad: ""Honestly, mom ... chances are he won't stay with you.

"(CNN) -- Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed on Wednesday defended the city's handling of a snowstorm that crippled traffic and left motorists stranded for hours a day earlier, and partly blamed local businesses, saying they contributed to gridlock by letting workers leave at the same time. Reed pointed out good things his administration did during a sometimes testy exchange with Carol Costello on ""CNN Newsroom on Wednesday Morning."" ""We got a million people out of the city,"" Reed said. ""We have not had any fatalities. We cleared the way of all of our hospitals, all of our police stations."" Costello cut in to say, ""Well, I heard this from public officials before, 'We didn't have any fatalities,' but that was just by the grace of God. There were a thousand traffic accidents. People got out of their cars on icy roadways in frigid conditions to walk home."" ""That's easy to say from your anchor seat,"" Reed said. ""No, I was out stuck in the traffic,"" Costello said. ""I was one of those people."" Reed said schools and businesses let people go at roughly the same time early Tuesday afternoon as the snow was starting. That was too much for the roads to handle, he said. ""I said immediately yesterday that releasing all of these folks was not the right way to go,"" Reed said to Costello. ""If I had my druthers, we would have staggered the closures."" Roughly 2 inches of snow left the roads icy, making virtual parking lots out of streets and highways. Many people, including students on school buses, were stranded in vehicles overnight. At a Wednesday morning news conference, Reed said Atlanta city road crews began pretreating streets at 9 a.m. Tuesday, ahead of the day's snowfall. He said city crews -- which have 30 spreaders and 40 snowplows -- had finished treating ""Priority 1"" areas such as bridges and exits, and their current focus is helping state crews clear the freeways. Stranded drivers tell their stories . He told Costello the road treatment has been better than in January 2011, when ""the city was closed for two to three days"" because of a winter storm. ""The city didn't even have snow equipment in the last storm,"" Reed said, later adding that it had ""four pieces of equipment"" in 2011. Now, he said, besides the sand- and salt-spreaders and snowplows, the city has a crew that has ""been working nonstop in 12-hour shifts."" At the news conference, Reed said 791 vehicle accidents -- ""14 with injuries"" -- were reported in the city since Tuesday's snowfall. He said city firefighters have supported 115 people, including stranded motorists. Asked what he wanted to say to parents of children who stayed in schools overnight after Tuesday's snowfall, he said: ""What I want to say to them is hold off on trying to get to them. What I can assure (you of) is they are safe."" He added: ""The safest place for them was in the school system. ... I know it is very tough, but we're going to make sure we're going to get the roads open. ... But right now, we (need people to stay off the roads).""","""If I had my druthers, we would have staggered the closures,"" Kasim Reed says .

"(CNN) -- Auctions are like sporting events; pundits and punters predict the outcome but never really know what will happen. Triumphs and record breakers tend to make art press headlines, while upsets are quickly swept under the nearest Oriental rug. The performance this week of a Chinese Ding bowl, bought for $3 at a yard sale and sold at auction in New York for $2.2 million, is the latest result in a string of successes for ""undiscovered"" Chinese porcelain at auction. It began in earnest in the 1970s and reached a climax on November 13, 2010, when a porcelain vase from the reign of 18th-century emperor Qianlong took a staggering 53 million pounds from a Chinese bidder in a tiny suburban London salesroom, the kind where bidders sit on sofas and chairs that are part of the estate auction. Both pieces sat unidentified, and unappreciated, for generations, rekindling the flame of hope that burns dimly inside all antiques enthusiasts, whether or not they care to admit it. Flea-marketeers and yard-salers openly acknowledge they live in a world of false hope, spending countless hours, like fishermen who catch nothing but the smallest fry, or nothing at all in most outings. Most hopes that live on are commonly dashed by the first encounter with a professional. The floor of an ""Antiques Roadshow "" taping set is littered with broken dreams -- and sometimes broken porcelain in emphasis. I do not believe anyone has ever statistically plotted the chances of turning up a valuable object at a yard sale opportunity, but expect such a number would be too small to register on any scale. Before any attempt to uncover a dream, it pays to think strategically about what it is you are looking for. Like finding the perfect partner, this may involve a process of elimination but depends largely on common sense and good powers of observation. The essential ingredient in determining value of an art object is no secret: supply and demand. I suggest those on the way to an early-morning yard sale repeat this over and over in the van. Rarity may therefore be a positive factor, but if something is rare, or perhaps unique, and no one wants it (your grandfather's homemade table lamp perhaps?), it has no value. On the other hand, an object may be plentiful, even mass-produced, but have even greater demand and therefore value. Some years ago I sold a Lalique perfume bottle at auction for a little more than $200,000. Its owner had purchased the bottle at Saks Fifth Avenue in 1937 (where it was marked down 50% on sale) for $25. There were plenty more waiting to be sold at the time. Quality is sometimes but not always a factor in value. Most baseball cards are extremely inexpensively made, and mass-produced, making all cards from any given series fundamentally the same, except of course for the subject. Most cards, even those a century old, are worth a few dollars at best, and a pitiful percentage rise into the hundreds individually, but a few are valued into six or even seven figures. The economics of supply and demand work powerfully when applied to the subtleties of collecting a set. It is not coincidental that most remarkable numbers lately have been put up by Chinese objects. The year 2010, in which China overtook Europe to become the second-largest art market after the United States, has been described as an annus mirabilis for Chinese art collecting as wealthy Chinese from all levels of the new society chose art and objects as tangible assets, suitable for investment, trading and bragging rights beyond simple display. The demand is as large as the Chinese population and economy, and supply of exquisite objects limited, thanks to most being in Western museums or private collections. A fundamental awareness of Chinese porcelain may be a big help in your hopes of finding the same success as the owner of the Ding bowl, but serious knowledge is an area of immense expertise shared by an elite few and respected by the trade above all other areas of understanding. If you rely on luck, however, Chinese porcelain is a fairly good bet. The Ding bowl looks quite ordinary to most of us. It is monochrome, with an extremely subtle pattern, and does not have a mark translating as ""valuable Ding bowl"" stamped on the bottom, making it look like a bowl found in Pottery Barn (and more commonly found at yard sales). Good luck in your search. The only other comparable example is in the British Museum. Perhaps a hidden treasure may be closer than you think. Heritage Auctions offers an example of the insanely rare 1913 Liberty Head nickel in April. The last one we offered sold for $3.73 million. It looks pretty much like any other nickel to most of us, and there may have been others in circulation. Check your pockets. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nicholas Dawes.","Nicholas Dawes: Ding bowl that fetched $2.2 million is the latest in big deals on Chinese art .

"(CNN) -- Authorities evacuated a Bermuda-bound flight at Philadelphia International Airport in Pennsylvania Thursday after one of three people loading the plane didn't appear to belong and suddenly left the area, police said. It appeared that the man in question was properly credentialed to be in a secure area, but was working on a plane that he wasn't supposed to, FBI spokesman J.J. Klaver said. When he was questioned by the other baggage handlers, the person left in a baggage loading cart, he said. US Airways Flight 1070 -- which police said was bound for Bermuda with 102 passengers and five crew members -- was towed to a secure part of the airport, where baggage was removed from the plane to be screened by bomb-sniffing dogs. The plane tested negative for explosives, and the incident is not believed to be terror-related, said Klaver. The investigation was ongoing, he added. In addition, no narcotics were found on board the plane, said Stephen Sapp of Customs and Border Protection. ""There's nothing explosive, nothing hazardous,"" Klaver said. He also said that there was no apparent failure in airport security processes. Flight 1070 finally departed for Bermuda nearly six hours late. Federal and local police at the airport had been searching for a man in uniform who was not wearing identification on the tarmac, a law enforcement official told CNN. ""This could be a suspicious person or it could be nothing,"" the official said. The rest of the airport was fully operational and not affected by the incident, said spokeswoman Victoria Lupica. The passengers remained in the terminal, said Todd Lehmacher, spokesman for US Airways. The airline hoped to get them back on the plane and headed for Bermuda once authorities allow it, he said. CNN's Carol Cratty, Jeanne Meserve, Ross Levitt and Deborah Feyerick contributed to this report.","NEW: Flight departs nearly six hours after scheduled .

"(CNN) -- Imagine a bicycle that was more than a means to get you to work in the morning, but a personal assistant to boot. It could shield you from oncoming traffic, look up weather conditions in advance, anticipate the road ahead and make adjustments to your journey. Imagine it could also double as smog filter, fit compactly on your bookshelf, and even fly. Okay, so your bicycle won't be able to do all those things at once, but hey, any one of those features makes for a pretty cool ride. Want to know what the future will bring? Read on to see how tomorrow's bicycles might look. The smog muncher . As a mode of transportation, bikes are about as environmentally friendly as it gets. The Bangkok based Lightfog Creative and Design Company, however, has upped cycling's already soaring ecological ante with its concept for an air-purifying bike. It has a carbon monoxide and dust filter mounted at the front and the theory is that with the help of a lithium-ion battery, the aluminum frame would use electricity to generate oxygen from an onboard water tank. At the moment, the idea exists solely as artistic renderings (the company has yet to make a prototype, though one is supposedly in the works). Still, the idea shows potential, as evidenced by the fact that it recently won a Red Dot design award. ""Star Wars"" speeder . According to Hollywood's many depictions of the future, we should all be making our travels via flying car or hover board. While the present-day is irksomely Earth-bound, there was recently a modest nod to the world we've been promised for decades by the entertainment industry. California-based engineering company Aerofex has created a flying ""hover bike"" that looks like it was plucked from the set of Star Wars. The ""Jedi bike"" floats with the help of ducted fans, and is fairly low-altitude (soaring up to a maximum 15 feet -- 4.6 meters). Read more: The 18 propeller helicopter . The current version is only a proof-of-concept used for development, but Aerofex says it is now working now on a production version. Alas, it is unlikely the bike will ever be available for popular consumption, but will likely be limited to agricultural and humanitarian uses. The smartest bike in the room . First conceived at MIT's SENSEable City Lab, the Copenhagen Wheel is a wireless device that turns any ordinary bike into an electronic hybrid. The wheel captures energy when the rider is going over easy terrain (i.e. downhill) and stores it in a battery pack. Conversely, the saved energy is used to give riders an electronic push when traversing difficult landscapes. The device has a sensor which learns the rider's individual style, and also anticipates aspects of the ride ahead, including road conditions and carbon monoxide levels. Riders are also able to control the wheel with their smartphones; they can lock and unlock it, track usage statistics (including calories burned and elevation climbed) and select a level of motor assistance. Startup Superpedestrian brought the wheel to the market last month, and has started taking pre-orders for $799. Laser footprint . In the last few years, the number of cyclists on the road has skyrocketed, which is great for many reasons. Unfortunately, the amount of cyclist casualties has risen dramatically as well. To combat the problem, a physics student from Brighton University, in England, invented Blaze, a front-mounted lamp that projects a green laser image five meters in front of a bicycle to let other road users know it is coming. The aim is to help prevent vehicles from turning across a cyclist's path by increasing his or her ""footprint"" on the road. Watch this: Pinarello's road racers . Bike in a box . Forget what engineering experts say, according to Dutch manufacturer firm PedalFactory, putting together a bike is about as complicated as making lunch. This month, the company has just started international shipments of the world's first flat-pack, self-assembly bicycles. ""If you can make a sandwich, you can make a Sandwichbike,"" or so goes the company motto. At â‚¬799.00 ($1,086), the price may seem a bit steep for a bike you build yourself, but then again, all the materials are locally and responsibly sourced, and each bike is tested for weatherproofing for six weeks in a climate control room at an independent wood research institute. The bike comes delivered in a compact box bearing 19 parts made from a combination of beech plywood and aluminum. Supposedly, it can be constructed in as little as 45 minutes.","New inventions turning low-tech bikes into sci-fi machines .

"(CNN) -- Poached for use in traditional Chinese medicine or sold as exotic pets. Sometimes slaughtered in a vicious, drawn-out war. We're all familiar with the themes dominating headlines about Africa's declining wildlife. Lions, elephants and tigers, one might think, will exist only in sad tales told to children in a decade or two. Yet amid the disturbing news, one African wildlife success story stands out like the sun rising over the Serengeti -- and it's great news for travelers. With sustainable wildlife tourism as the long-term goal, the southern African nation of Namibia has been making ambitious commitments to habitat conservation since its independence in 1990.

More than 40% of Namibia is now under some form of conservation management. Officially inaugurated in March 2012, the KAZA (Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area) initiative established a 100,000-square-mile, five-nation conservation zone -- the world's largest. Encompassing the entire Caprivi Panhandle in Namibia, KAZA's ""conservation beyond borders"" approach protects wildlife corridors shared by Angola, Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Central to the effort are the communal conservancies -- rural communities that share the proceeds of wildlife ventures equitably between members -- that now cover one-fifth of the country and affect 250,000 rural Namibians. Human-wildlife conflict reversed . In many cases, poachers have become protectors, as Namibians have come to appreciate the long-term benefits of living with wildlife. Generations of human-wildlife conflict are being reversed, while communities are made stakeholders. Much of Namibia's wildlife is now flourishing. This is also good news for travelers. With more than 30 conservancy lodges dotting the Caprivi Panhandle and north-central regions -- Namibia's wildlife hotbeds -- visitors are privy to some of the most unforgettable wildlife encounters in Africa. Five top Namibian wildlife lodges . Susuwe Island Lodge . This remote island lodge in Namibia's eastern Caprivi is a gateway to wildlife spotting along the Kwando River and perennial wetlands.

"(CNN) -- The world's busiest airport is not in New York or London, but Atlanta. Whatever way it is measured -- passenger traffic or airplane movements -- Atlanta's international airport tops the ranking. More than 95 million passengers passed through Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in 2012, according to Airports Council International's latest report that was released last year. The airport also boasts the highest number of takeoffs and landings, with 930,000 flight movements in 2012. With such sheer volume, navigating an aircraft there can be a great challenge. Tom Staigle, chief pilot of Delta, whose main main hub is at Atlanta, compares the airport to ""a congested freeway."" ""We have on a clear day, 120 airplanes per hour flying in and out of here, so you have to be on your toes,"" Staigle says. Atlanta has five runways that are kept busy with aircraft's comings and goings. Pilots need to pay attention even when they are on the ground. ""You have to be careful to ensure you're on the correct taxiway and you don't end up on a runway,"" says Delta pilot Stuart Kenny, ""or do something else and taxi to the wrong place as you're getting ready for takeoff."" To give an idea how daunting it is to fly from and into Atlanta, Kenney takes CNN Business Traveller to a flight simulator. As a plane approaches Atlanta, a pilot would see the airport's multiple runways, a field of aircraft and a multitude of activities. ""You'd see aircraft in front of you, see aircraft over here on the north complex,"" says Kenny, ""see aircraft taking off at the far end, and you'd see guys turning onto the south runways."" That's why those in the cockpit need to work closely with those in the airport control tower. ""Air traffic control and the pilots are working together,"" says Kenney, ""so you have to monitor all these targets and make sure nobody incurs into your air space and causes a problem."" As the result, ""the radio traffic is daunting, says Kenney. ""The radio calls are constant, so you have to listen carefully."" And it is not just about managing landings and takeoffs. ""Think about the bags, and transferring passengers from all over the world,"" Staigle says. ""Not only do they get where they need to be on time most of the time, but their bags come with them, and it's a pleasant experience."" The world's busiest airport is not among the world's best, however. Of the 100 airports listed in Skytrax's 2013 World Airport Awards ranking, Atlanta's is at No. 48, though it's also named one of the most improved airports. For many pilots, their first landing in Atlanta is likely to be an unforgettable experience. ""It was really busy. I was a young co-pilot, and I was probably sweating a gallon of water,"" Kenney recalls. As soon as they landed, he had to go through the after-landing checklist and talked on the radio. ""There's no time to savor the experience,"" says Kenney. It is the world's busiest airport, after all.","Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport is the world's busiest airport .

"(CNN) -- So there was Hank Aaron, leaning back in his chair during an exclusive CNN interview in the clubhouse of an Atlanta golf club, and the former slugger of the Atlanta Braves was fretting over the spot. What's going to happen to the spot, he said, raising his eyebrows? It's the spot that was visited on April 8, 1974, by a baseball representing the 715th home run of his career. Just like that, Babe Ruth's record was history. So is the spot -- almost. For now, the spot is preserved in a parking lot that once was Atlanta Fulton-County Stadium, where Aaron sealed his immortality with his high-arching blast over the fence in left-center field. The spot is surrounded by part of the old ballpark's outfield wall, and high above the spot is a large baseball-shaped placard with the inscription: Hank Aaron, home run, 715, April 8, 1974. The whole scene is illuminated by lights. As a result, those traveling across the street to the Braves' current place of Turner Field can see the spot as they either walk through or drive by the parking lot at night. ""I'd hate for that mark to be destroyed,"" said Aaron, shaking his head while looking visibly distraught. ""In fact, I've gone out there with several people and taken pictures at that spot."" That spot is among the places in the universe that should remain as unmolested as possible for eternity. Think Gettysburg. The Mount of Olives. Dealey Plaza. Tranquility Base. What Aaron did 40 years ago Tuesday with a flick of his quick wrists was as much for society as it was for baseball. Just 27 years after Jackie Robinson broke the game's color barrier, Aaron was a black man from Mobile, Alabama, shattering the most sacred of records, not only for baseball, but for sports. The old mark belonged to a white man who was so beloved that he is credited with helping to save the game during the 1920s. Chasing Ruth's ghost was challenging enough, but Aaron also had to battle a slew of hate mail and death threats. He succeeded, and for proof, there is the spot, at least for the moment. The Braves plan to move from Turner Field to a northern suburb called Smyrna, Georgia, at the start of the 2017 season. They will take the statue of Aaron with them, because they can rip it from the ground in front of Turner Field and carry it to their dream land. The Braves can't move the spot, though. Atlanta mayor: Cost too high to keep Braves . So there was Aaron, contemplating the spot's future after he used his famously rich voice to discuss nearly everything and everybody he encountered during his 80 years on Earth, and he did so with passion. Aaron on Jackie Robinson: ""Of course, back then (when I was a youngster), my mother expected me to go to school, but I had read the Dodgers were going to play an exhibition game in Mobile. Jackie was speaking at a drugstore and I said, 'I'm not going to get this opportunity again, so I better take my chances and listen to Jackie Robinson now.' Little did I know, I got front row seats, and next to me was my father. It was worth it, and I don't need to tell you what happened after that (a spanking)! But it was worth it. (Jackie) was my hero, always had been and not only because the baseball player he was, but for the person he was."" Still, despite Aaron adding that he felt an obligation to become the new Jackie as a vocal critic of baseball regarding diversity after Robinson's death in 1972, he didn't make that the most sentimental time of the interview. Aaron on Martin Luther King Jr., and other civil rights leaders that he often encountered in Atlanta: ""The one I had the most contact with was (Benjamin Mays, the president of Morehouse College and MLK's mentor). He and I were very close, and every year around Thanksgiving, he'd come over to my house and have a little Harveys Bristol Cream. He wouldn't drink much, but he would just sit down and tell you some stories. It was fascinating."" The same goes for Aaron's thoughts after No. 715 flew off his Louisville Slugger. ""When I touched first base and got almost to second base, I started thinking about: 'Isn't this wonderful the fact that here I am, the third oldest child of Estella and Herbert Aaron, and the two of them are sitting in the stands, watching their son play professional baseball,' "" Aaron said. "" 'Isn't it wonderful that they could be here on this day to witness history?' I tell you, to this day, I don't know how she managed to do it, but (my mother) got to home plate quicker than I got to home base."" That said, Aaron only battled a baseball-sized lump in his throat during the interview when he discussed the spot. ""I certainly wouldn't want it destroyed,"" he said, with misty eyes. ""I'd like for it to remain there in some way . . . I've not talked to the mayor, so I don't know what his thoughts are on it."" I know. I contacted the office of Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed, and I got an e-mail from Reed praising Aaron, especially when it comes to his endless work helping kids through his Chasing the Dream Foundation. Then, after Reed said the city plans to redevelop the area around Turner Field when the Braves leave, Reed wrote, ""I will do everything in my power to ensure that any development proposal considered by the City of Atlanta for the future of the Turner Field area maintains the integrity of this important monument to (Aaron's) record-smashing 715th home run."" When I told him that, Aaron just exhaled.","Hank Aaron broke Babe Ruth's home run record 40 years ago .

"(CNN) -- A 36-year-old man goes out with some friends. They hit a handful of bars. The 36-year-old has some drinks. At the end of the night last May, as the last bar closes, he decides to slide down the railing of the stairs heading out. He loses his balance and falls backward. Four stories. He dies from a skull fracture. His blood alcohol level was .25, more than four times the DUI threshold. Who's responsible? Before you answer that, let me tell you another story. Last April, a man goes out drinking with friends to celebrate his 21st birthday. He ends the night at the same bar the 36-year-old ended his last night at. As life would have it, he, too, decided to slide down the railing. He, too, lost his balance. He, too, fell back four stories. The death certificate stated ""acute ethanol intoxication"" played a role in his death. In 2009 another partying 21-year-old fell to his death in that same stairwell. Now who do you think is to blame, the bar or the patron? Because the stairwell was up to code, I believe the fault lies with the patron. The Michigan Liquor Control Commission is going after the bar. Last week at a state hearing, officials recommended suspending the liquor license for 10 days for the Grand Rapids, Michigan, four-story, 70,000-square-foot multi-venue entertainment hub affectionately known as The B.O.B. (short for Big Old Building). The punishment is for what officials believe is a culture of over-serving customers, which the bar says it has taken steps to avoid. After the 36-year-old's death, many in the area went online to point an angry cyberfinger at the bar's owner for not making it safer for drunk people to slide down railings 40 feet in the air. Anyone who questioned the decision of the deceased was deemed insensitive. Much in the same way, some Chicagoans were upset there weren't more lifesavers along the city's river, after a drunk man hopped a fence, ignored the ""park closed"" signs, fell into the icy waters and died. Why did he venture out to the slick and slushy banks during what has become the coldest Chicago winter in 30 years? To retrieve a dropped cellphone that landed on a broken shard of ice. A friend he was with also died that night trying to save him. These are all sad, tragic stories. But they come with the territory. Prohibition was repealed in 1933 because we the people wanted the freedom to drink. And as with all freedom there exists the burden of personal responsibility. We have age restrictions, we severely punish law breakers, we educate consumers and make public service announcements like ""Drink Responsibly."" Yet nearly 90,000 people still die from excessive drinking every year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. What are we gonna do? Go back to Prohibition -- because you know, the war on drugs is so successful? -- or recognize government can detour behavior but it can't legislate away stupid. Case in point: the Kentucky pastor who starred in a reality TV show about snake-handling in church who died last week from a snakebite. So if you're the kind of person who thinks it's cool to drink large quantities of alcohol out of a toilet -- which one participant in the social media drinking game ""Neknominate"" was photographed doing -- I'm more prone to give you the side-eye than blame Facebook. Nonetheless, because at least five people have died playing the game, Facebook was compelled to issue a statement which read in part: . ""We do not tolerate content which is directly harmful, for example bullying, but behavior which some people may find offensive or controversial is not always necessarily against our rules."" Which sounds reasonable to me but wasn't enough for Dr. Sarah Jarvis, a medical adviser for the UK-based charity Drinkaware. She said Facebook should remove the videos, noting ""if the thrill wasn't there, your mates weren't seeing you, I expect it would very rapidly fizzle out."" She's right in that Neknominate -- a game in which players post video of themselves drinking a large amount of alcohol while doing something crazy and then challenge friends to outdo them -- may lose popularity in its current incarnation. But as the recent tragedies in small cities like Grand Rapids and large ones like Chicago point out, Neknominate isn't the issue. The issue isn't alcohol. The issue is us. While I understand the desire to want to save everyone from themselves, I also understand that we can't. Alcohol is legal, and every year tens of millions of people consume without incident. And every year tens of thousands of people die of an alcohol-related death. Some as innocent victims, some because of addiction and some because of a bad decision. That's the deal we made back in 1933, and I doubt we'll go back. One of the Neknominate participants drank alcohol mixed with motor oil. Motor oil! I refuse to make that Mark Zuckerberg's fault. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson: Alcohol kills tens of thousands of people a year .

"(CNN) -- The 54-year-old Michigan tree trimmer severely beaten after he accidentally struck a child who had stepped into the street earlier this month is breathing on his own, according to his daughter. ""He is off the ventilator and is able to breathe on his own,"" Mandi Marie Utash posted Friday to a GoFundMe.com page she and her brother set up for their father, who they say does not have health insurance. Steven Utash was set upon by about a dozen people after his truck struck a 10-year-old boy, police said. After Utash stopped his vehicle to help the boy, he was ""severely beaten"" with ""fists and feet,"" Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy said in a statement. Authorities credited a woman who stepped in as Utash was being attacked with saving his life. Mandi Marie Utash wrote that her father doesn't seem to know what happened to him or why he was in the hospital, but that he is able to wiggle his toes on command and answer yes or no questions. ""These are baby steps,"" she says. She wrote that her father ""keeps flashing back to the assault screaming for ""HELP"" and ""PLEASE GET THEM OFF ME."" ""This is a long road ahead,"" she said. ""But the end of the road will be worth it."" Steven Utash had previously been in a medically induced coma. Jennifer Moreno, a police spokeswoman, told CNN that all of the alleged assailants were African-American and that none are known to be related to the boy or his family. She said the beating was ""a spontaneous response."" Utash is white. Five suspects ranging in age from 16 to 30 have been arrested so far and charged with assault with intent to murder and assault with intent to do great bodily harm, according to Worthy. The 16-year-old, who is charged as a juvenile, is accused of ethnic intimidation. The state of Michigan's penal code says a person is guilty of ethnic intimidation ""if that person maliciously, and with specific intent to intimidate or harass another person because of that person's race, color, religion, gender, or national origin, causes physical contact with another person [or] damages, destroys, or defaces any real or personal property of another person."" It can carry a prison sentence of up to two years. On Saturday, the 16-year-old had his preliminary hearing and was ordered held on $400,000 bond. His next court appearance will be April 17. The prosecutor's office said the boy who was struck by Utash's truck was taken to a local hospital and treated for a leg injury. He is at home recovering. Some have suggested that the attack reflects racial tensions in the city. Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan and City Council President Brenda Jones issued a statement Friday asking for calm. ""This senseless vigilante-style attack is not the essence of who we are as Detroiters and will not be tolerated,"" the statement said. Utash's other daughter, Felicia Utash, told CNN affiliate WXYZ that she doesn't want to believe the assault on her father was a hate crime, but she is pleased that suspects have been apprehended. Police were searching for the remaining suspects. CNN's Haimy Assefa contributed to this report.","Steven Utash, 54, appears to be recovering from beating, daughter says .

"Cambridge, Massachusetts (CNN) -- The announcement that Accenture has decided to end its marketing relationship with Tiger Woods -- now that the superstar is making headlines for his infidelity and sudden break from the sport of golf -- is raising larger doubts about the strategy of relying on celebrity endorsers. Why would any firm center its marketing efforts on an athlete, particularly in today's media landscape in which a celebrity's missteps are so easily captured and disseminated via gossip and social-networking Web sites? Would it not be better for firms to shy away from aligning themselves with celebrity endorsers? While the strategy is inherently risky -- endorsers are people, after all, and people make mistakes -- and while Accenture's decision to cut ties with Woods is probably justified given the circumstances, in general, the rewards of relying on endorsers very likely far outweigh the risks. Endorsers often create tremendous value for the companies that rely on their services -- that is why the best endorsers are so richly compensated, and why most top athletes in America make more money from sponsorships than from salary or winnings. Marketers of brands that employ the services of celebrities will know that few promotional strategies can impact the bottom line as much as -- and as quickly as -- forming an alliance with a celebrity. In a recent study in which I analyzed hundreds of athlete endorsements, I found that sales for brands in a variety of consumer-product categories jumped an average of 4 percent in the six months following the start of an endorsement deal, even after controlling for advertising expenditures and other factors that could be expected to drive up sales. Several brands saw sales rise with more than 20 percent after teaming up with an endorser. And important to managers, the strategy seemingly helps to differentiate brands from their competitors, which did not experience any spillover of increased sales. The study, co-authored with Jeroen Verleun, even showed that the stock market favorably responds to athlete endorsements: On the day such a deal is announced, the endorsed firm's stock can be expected to increase nearly a quarter percent. And illustrating the payoff of betting on a winning athlete, stock prices further increase every time the athlete secures a major victory, such as a PGA championship. In fact, athletes with a strong track record emerged as particularly effective endorsers in the study in almost all possible respects. Why do celebrity endorsements work as well as they do? One obvious explanation is that celebrities help firms to tap into their fan base. They open new markets. Consider tennis star Maria Sharapova, one of today's most sought-after -- and, as our research shows, most effective -- endorsers: The mere fact that Sharapova promotes fashion label Cole Haan may encourage her most devoted fans to visit its shops, allowing Cole Haan to perhaps attract a younger and more diverse demographic. A second, more subtle, explanation is that endorsements trigger sales by reassuring consumers of the quality of the endorsed brand. Consumers often cannot easily assess the true quality of products, at least not before they consume them. But seeing a celebrity attaching his or her name and good reputation to a product may help alleviate some of their uncertainty. Consciously or unconsciously, they might trust, say, Sharapova to endorse Prince tennis rackets only if those products truly are of premium quality. After all, Sharapova herself would be at risk of damaging her reputation if that were not the case. A third possibility is that an alliance with an endorser can convey important information about an attribute that helps differentiate a brand from its competitors. This is particularly helpful for attributes that are hard to explain, demonstrate, or measure. Canon's reason for turning to Maria Sharapova was her reputation as someone who plays aggressively but with precision, and who has a sense of style -- exactly the kinds of attributes it hoped to emphasize in marketing its line of PowerShot cameras. This is probably where the partnership between Accenture and Tiger Woods went south. Judging by its advertising campaign over the years, the global consulting firm relied on Woods to emphasize attributes such as its strategic focus and discipline (""Strategy 80%. Exit Strategy 20%""); the payoffs of its risk-taking behavior (""Go On. Be a Tiger""); and its ability to recover from setbacks (""It's What You Do Next That Counts"") -- precisely the kind of values that may be difficult to communicate under the current circumstances. So it is understandable that the firm decided to cut ties with Woods in order to limit a negative impact on its reputation. However, now that the company has responded, we should not lose sight of the bigger picture: Any short-term negative effects are very unlikely to outweigh the strong benefits the company experienced during its six-year relationship with the golfer. Marketers who rely on athlete endorsers know they can be in for a rocky road -- their allied partners can suffer from injuries, a loss of form, scandals, rumors, and a range of other woes -- and they need to adapt accordingly. But don't expect firms to cut back on the strategy altogether, as endorsers on the whole generate considerable value. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Anita Elberse.","Tiger Woods endorsement deal highlights risks of relying on a celebrity to sell products .
Anita Elberse says her research shows firms using endorsers generally reap big gains .
She says sales increase and endorsements can boost a firm's stock price .

"Washington (CNN) -- Before leaving Washington to concentrate efforts on their re-election campaigns, U.S. senators voted Saturday to fund the federal government into 2013 and passed a measure asserting a tough stance towards Iran over its nuclear program. In a 62 to 30 vote in a session that stretched past midnight, the legislators approved the moneys necessary for government to function for the next six months and avoided a possible shutdown until early next year - thus forgoing any partisan funding standoff well past November's election date. The bill will go to President Obama for its anticipated signature into law. In a bipartisan show of steadfastness on Iran, Senators passed a non-binding resolution - nearly unanimously - for the United States to pursue a policy other than containment, if necessary to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Senate Joint Resolution 41 advises that time is running out on diplomacy, and it ""rejects any United States policy that would rely on efforts to contain a nuclear weapons-capable Iran."" The bill reflects and supports President Obama's existing stance. It passed with only one vote against it, that of Republican Senator Rand Paul from Kentucky. ""A vote for this resolution is a vote for the concept of preemptive war,"" Paul objected in his arguments before the Senate preceding the roll call ballot. The bill text ended with the statement: ""Nothing in this resolution shall be construed as an authorization for the use of force or a declaration of war."" Paul found himself at odds with Senators from both parties a second time in the late-night session, when legislators from both parties in a 81 to 10 vote handily rejected a bill, which the Kentucky senator had sponsored, to strip perceived uncooperative Islamic countries of U.S. foreign aid. Under the measure, Egypt, Libya and Pakistan -- nations Paul argues have not been willing partners in the war on terror -- would have lost American support. Several Republican senators had spoken out against Paul's measure saying now is not the time to take the funds from countries with nascent governments that could be important partners with the United States in the future.","Senate votes to fund the federal government into 2012, putting off any possible shutdown .

"(CNN) -- ""We aim 2 Tease, Please & Satisfy,"" the online classified ads said, according to police, but instead a Florida prostitution business allegedly lured men with the promise of sex with underage girls and robbed them instead. A 22-year-old Deltona woman described by the Volusia County Sheriff's Office as the ""ringleader"" of the operation is now facing 12 felony charges and one misdemeanor. Devin Rachelle Miller allegedly ran the business out of her home for at least four months, according to a sheriff's office press release, soliciting men with ads on backpage.com that showed pictures of what appeared to be underage girls and included phrases like ""Hey Fellas Ready To Have the Night You've Always Dreamed Of?"" and ""Twice the Fun, Twice the Exitment""(sic). An arrest affidavit obtained by HLN states that the sheriff's office was first alerted to the ads in December via a tip submitted to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children claiming that the females in the ads looked young. Another tip submitted last month specifically alleged that one of the females in an ad was underage. According to an arrest affidavit, investigators determined that one of the girls was 16 and had been reported missing on March 5 and recovered on March 24. Investigators interviewed that teen, and according to the arrest affidavit, she claimed men responding to the ads would pay to have sex acts performed by Miller or other females, but Miller and her male associates often robbed them at gunpoint when they arrived. The teen said that they sometimes stole up to $400 from ""dates"" who came to the house looking for sex. ""Devin would tell the guys that if they reported the robbery or the prostitution, that she would tell the police that they were at the house for prostitution and that they could go to jail,"" the arrest affidavit alleged. Miller allegedly told the 16-year-old and a 17-year-old who was serving as a live-in nanny for a 2-year-old child in the home that she made thousands of dollars a week from the business. One of the teens told investigators that ""Devin was the 'PIMP,' the head leader and posted all of the backpage.com ads"" and that she received a cut of any money the girls earned, the arrest affidavit stated. According to the sheriff's office, the 2-year-old girl was sometimes present in the house when prostitution, drug use and robberies occurred. Miller remains in custody at Volusia County Jail with bond set at $26,500. She is facing five counts of procuring a person under the age of 18 for prostitution, five counts of deriving support from the proceeds of prostitution, and one count each of unlawful use of a two-way communications device, child neglect and petit theft. A public defender appointed to represent Miller had not returned HLN's calls Wednesday afternoon seeking comment on the case. Miller's arraignment is scheduled for April 24.","A Florida woman promised clients sex with underage girls but robbed them instead, police say .

"(CNN) -- Bubba Watson turned on the style to win his second U.S. Masters title in three years after a final round 69 gave him a three-shot victory in the opening major of the 2014 season. Watson briefly trailed his last day playing partner Jordan Spieth before pulling clear on the back nine at Augusta to repeat his 2012 triumph with an eight-under-par total of 280. The 20-year-old Spieth finished in a tie for second at five-under with Sweden's Jonas Blixt, who was also making a superb debut at the Masters. Popular 50-year-old Spaniard Miguel Angel Jimenez claimed fourth place a further shot behind after a closing 71. Watson did not panic when Spieth moved two clear on the front nine and a four-shot swing on the eighth and ninth saw him take a lead he never relinquished. His victory was highlighted by a monster 366-yard drive on the 13th to set up a two-putt birdie and a three-shot advantage going into the closing holes. The chasers were unable to make a sustained challenge to leave the 35-year-old Watson to savor another triumph in the 78th edition of the famous tournament. After putting out on the 18th green an emotional Watson burst into tears before embracing family members. ""I don't remember the last few I holes, I just remember hanging on to make pars,"" he said before donning the Green Jacket for the second time in the traditional ceremony. Watson has been in fine form on the PGA Tour leading into the Masters, claiming the Northern Trust Open in Los Angeles in February -- his fifth career win and first since his initial triumph at Augusta. The pre-tournament talk was of Tiger Woods' withdrawal through injury and of Adam Scott's chances of a repeat triumph, the Australian eventually finishing a creditable one-over-par in his title defense. But Watson sprung to prominence with a second round 68 with a run of five straight birdies to show his intent, his eventual victory taking him into the top five of the new world rankings. ""The first one I felt I lucked into,"" he admitted. ""A lot of hard work and determination went into this one,"" he added. A host of golfers eyed victory on a tight leader board going into the final round, but the likes of Matt Kuchar and Rickie Fowler were unable to threaten Watson and the American pair finished tied for fifth on two-under, a shot ahead of England's Lee Westwood. Pre-tournament favorite Rory McIlroy finished strongly with a three-under 69 for level par, but his hopes were ended by a poor second round.","Bubba Watson wins Masters for the second time .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- North and South Korea have agreed to hold reunions later this month of families separated since the Korean War, Seoul said Wednesday. If they go ahead, the meetings of divided Korean families would be the first to take place since 2010. The reunions of about 100 people from each country are scheduled to take place between February 20 and 25, the South Korean unification ministry said Wednesday, following face-to-face talks between the two sides. But those scheduled to participate are likely to be aware that North Korea has unceremoniously pulled the plug on such meetings in the past. Past disappointment . Reunions were due to take place last September, but Pyongyang canceled them with only a few days notice, accusing Seoul of souring ties between the two countries. South Korea says it sought reassurances in Wednesday's talks that the families' hopes wouldn't be dashed this time around. ""Our side expressed the position that what happened last year cannot be repeated,"" the unification ministry said. ""The North shared the view."" The reunions are an emotive issue. And time is running out for many of the surviving members of the families that were split by the 1950-53 war between the two Koreas. A lot of them are now in their 80s and 90s. Tens of thousands of people in South Korea are on the list of those wanting to take part in the reunions. This month's planned reunions are scheduled to take place at the site where previous ones were held: Mount Kumgang, a resort on the North Korean side of the border that used to be jointly operated by both sides. Calls for better ties . The agreement on the date for the reunions follows a series of calls by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's regime for better relations between the two countries. South Korean officials had said they wanted to see action rather than words from Pyongyang, including moving ahead with family reunions. Wednesday's deal is a small step forward. But a contentious issue between the two sides is also looming at the end of this month: annual military exercises in the region by South Korean and U.S. forces. The drills infuriate North Korea, which says it sees them as a prelude to an invasion. Last year, it ratcheted up its threatening rhetoric to alarming levels as the exercises took place. In its calls so far this year for better relations, North Korea has asked South Korea not to take part in the drills -- a request that Seoul and Washington have rejected. North Korea blames South, cancels family reunions in September . CNN's Paula Hancocks and K.J. Kwon reported from Seoul, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong.","The reunions will take place between February 20 and 25, South Korea says .

"(CNN) -- Nuclear scientists in Switzerland recently dropped some antimatter. The world didn't blow up, but there were some tiny explosions. Scientists are hoping the experiment will teach them more about how the universe developed after the Big Bang. Physicists with ALPHA Collaboration research group are trying to figure out how antimatter interacts with gravity, and if it produces ""antigravity,"" says the group's founder, Jeffrey Hangst. Their experiment mirrors the way Sir Isaac Newton came up with the law of gravity in the late 17th century. Legend has it that an apple fell off a tree and hit the English nobleman on the head. Newton got to thinking how gravity made the apple speed up as it fell. He postulated that matter attracts matter via gravitational force, which is why an object like an apple would fall toward a larger object: the earth. So, if matter attracts matter, what happens when antimatter interacts with it? Will it produce antigravity? And would then a ball of antimatter fall up? Gravity with a twist . ""That would be a revolution,"" Hangst says. ""That would mean we don't understand something fundamental about the universe."" And a big piece of the puzzle is indeed missing, he admits. Though people live with the effects of gravity every day and Newton's law of gravity has been around for over 300 years, scientific understanding of gravity is lagging, he says. ""The way planets and stars move, we understand that well."" But how matter attracts matter on a molecular level is still greatly a mystery, Hangst says. The ALPHA Collaboration hopes to raise the level of understanding. Antimatter science vs. fiction . Antimatter may be the stuff of science fiction movies and novels, but it is hardly futuristic, according to CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research in Geneva, where Hangst's group runs its experiments. Scientists have known about antimatter for more than 80 years, after physicist Carl Anderson discovered positrons in the 1930s. CERN makes the antimatter for ALPHA's experiment using a particle accelerator, which speeds up subatomic particles to nearly the speed of light and crashes them into each other to produce new particles. In the world of Dan Brown's ""Angels and Demons"" and Gene Roddenberry's ""Star Trek,"" antimatter can make the Vatican explode or power a star ship. If a large chunk of antimatter were to touch a large chunk of matter, the explosion would indeed be enormous, but it's unlikely to happen. Antimatter has not existed naturally in the universe for a very long time. ""Not in the last 13.7 billion years,"" Hangst jokes. That's basically as long as the known universe has existed. Antimatter abounded . But scientists have long theorized that a lot of antimatter was produced during the universe's inception. It has since disappeared, and they would like to know why. If equal amounts of matter and antimatter existed initially, they should have annihilated each other, but they didn't. Only matter is left behind. The kind of antimatter CERN makes for the experiment is antihydrogen, a mirror image of hydrogen, which is the smallest known atom. Because it is composed of so few parts, it's the easiest antimatter atom to make. Antihydrogen's subatomic particles have an electronic charge opposite from those of regular hydrogen. Hangst's team uses the latest technology to catch the antihydrogen atoms, hold them without letting them touch matter, and then drop them. When the falling antimatter meets matter, the two ""annihilate"" each other, as scientists say, and give off energy in the process -- a kind of nano-explosion. The ALPHA scientists measure the energy bursts to find how fast the antihydrogen molecules fell after they dropped them. The result . So, did the antimatter fall up? Scientists with the ALPHA Experiment couldn't tell, according to study published in Nature Communications. But the fact that they now have the technology to let it free-fall is a big deal, Hangst said. ""That you can do this at all ... is a bit of a revolution."" It paves the way for scientists to get the answer in a relatively short time -- a few years instead of a few decades. If scientists can figure out how antimatter interacts with gravity, it would take them a step closer to understanding how the universe was formed during the Big Bang, when a lot of antimatter was still around, Hangst says. Many scientists believe that antimatter acts in the same or in a similar manner as matter when it comes to gravity. The ALPHA Collaboration puts that stance to the test. ""In a world in which physicists have only recently discovered that we cannot account for most of the matter and energy in the universe,"" the study says, it would be ""presumptuous"" to cling to the idea. ""We know that there is something fundamental about the universe that we don't understand,"" Hangst said. In essence, scientists don't know why the universe exists at all.

"London (CNN) -- After a wild and stormy night that claimed two lives, many communities in southern England face a high risk of flooding Saturday from still-rising rivers. Severe flood warnings are in place along the Thames Valley to the west of London, as well as in southwest and central England. The Environment Agency warned that flood risk will continue for at least another week. An elderly passenger died Friday aboard the British-based cruise ship MS Marco Polo after it was hit by a ""freak wave during adverse sea conditions,"" according to the ship's owner, Cruise & Maritime Voyages. The rogue wave struck as the ship made its way into the English Channel en route from the Azores to its home port in Tilbury, southeast England, it said. As high winds whipped southern England on Friday night, a 49-year-old woman was killed when the front of a building collapsed onto her vehicle in central London, police said. Two other passengers in the car were injured. Police said the collapse happened during bad weather, but they were unable to say if it was directly related. On Saturday, amid increasing questions about the government response, Prime Minister David Cameron visited Chertsey, Surrey and thanked the military for its help during the crisis. The Environment Agency reported that 16 severe flood warnings remained in place Saturday, meaning there is a danger to life, as well as 151 lower-level flood warnings in different parts of the country. Thames Barrier, which is deployed to prevent the tidal river now flooding central London with devastating consequences, was shut for a record 16th consecutive time to help reduce flood risk along the Thames, according to the Environment Agency. The emergency will continue over the coming days for the Somerset Levels and Moors, where river levels continue to rise, posing a further threat to those already affected by recent flooding, the agency said. ""Despite an improving forecast the risk of flooding will continue for many communities in southern parts of England over the next few days,"" Paul Leinster, the Environment Agency's chief executive, said in a statement. More rain is forecast over the weekend, pushing river levels ever higher. Homes sandbagged . After the wettest January in England in 2Â½ centuries, February has so far brought little relief. The River Thames has reached its highest levels for over 60 years in some places, bringing flood misery to thousands of people living in the Thames Valley. The towns of Maidenhead and Windsor, where the queen has a castle, and communities in the counties of Surrey, Buckinghamshire, Berkshire and Reading are all at risk from the Thames. Residents desperate to hold back the rising waters have sandbagged entrances to their homes and businesses. Princes William and Harry lent their help to the flood defense effort Friday morning, as they joined soldiers who hefted sandbags in the village of Datchet in Berkshire. There is also a risk of flooding on the River Severn in Gloucester and on the Somerset Levels, in southwest England. Some communities on the Somerset Levels have been inundated for weeks. As well as high river levels, saturated ground from weeks of heavy rain mean that there is nowhere for water to go. Severe gales, large waves and high sea levels were expected to bring a high risk of coastal flooding to parts of the Dorset coast on Saturday, the Environment Agency said. Other areas along the south coast of England will also be battered by extreme weather. Nearly 6,000 properties have been flooded since the beginning of December, more than 1,000 of them in the wealthy areas in the Thames Valley. Leinster said more than 1.3 million properties have been protected since the start of December through the Environment Agency and use of the Thames Barrier. CNN's Erin McLaughlin, Talia Kayali, Chelsea J. Carter, Brian Walker, Ray Sanchez and Bharati Naik contributed to this report.","Rising waters may bring more flooding to communities near swollen rivers .

"(CNN) -- He won his first major at Augusta, played several rounds there with the President of the United States and racked up a record 50 consecutive Masters appearances -- but that's not what leaps to Arnold Palmer's mind when he reflects on the Georgia course. He points instead to the way in which the Masters -- the only one of golf's four major tournaments to take place at the same course every year -- has spread the gospel of golf across Palmer's home nation. ""I think the Masters is something that has brought golf to the American people in a way that no other course and no other golf course could do,"" the 84-year-old told CNN. ""They rally around Augusta, and not just people in the southeastern states. They come from California, Washington, Wisconsin -- everywhere -- and that brings a certain mystique to the surface."" ""Lloyd Mangrum once said to me: 'You know Arnie, I've won a few golf tournaments in my life but I'd give them all up for one Masters.' "" Unlike the late Mangrum, who won the U.S. Open in 1946 but twice finished runner-up at Augusta (where his lowest round of 64 was a tournament record for 46 years), Palmer had no such problems. In 1958, just three years after turning pro, he took possession of the green jacket -- the first of four Masters triumphs, and of seven majors in total. Forty-six years later, Palmer -- then 74 -- received an unforgettable standing ovation as he approached the 18th green for the final competitive time after half a century of contesting the course. Latest scores: Masters leaderboard . Like Tiger Woods, who misses his first Masters this week because of back surgery, it is the tournament in which Palmer competed the most -- so what made it so special? ""Well, of course, the golf course itself. And the club is such a great place. Everything!"" opined one of the sport's all-time greats. ""The location, the geography of the club, the way the course rolled, the condition -- it was always in impeccable condition, the greens were always good, the fairways. ""The entire golf course was something that was a pleasure to be on and I just thoroughly enjoyed it."" The scene of his victories in 1958, 1960, 1962 and 1964, Augusta was also where Palmer played plenty of golf with Dwight Eisenhower, the U.S. President of 1953-1961. Their first round came just hours after Palmer had won his first Masters in 1958. ""I was on the course when (then Augusta chairman) Cliff Roberts, a very close friend of Ike's, came out and said the President had said he'd like to play the next day if I had time and would join him,"" Palmer recalls. It was the first of many rounds that the duo would enjoy together, with Palmer later describing the golf-obsessed Eisenhower as like a ""second father."" No mention of Eisenhower and Augusta can of course be made without recalling the loblolly pine that became one of the most famous trees in golf history. Standing a little over 200 yards from the tee, to the left of the fairway, the tree was one that the sitting U.S. President, an Augusta member, wanted removed because of his tendency to hit it so often. At a governors meeting in 1956, the world's most powerful man proposed that the tree be cut down -- only for his friend Roberts, acting in his capacity as chairman, to rule him out of order and adjourn the meeting. The pine was swiftly nicknamed the ""Eisenhower Tree"" and had stood proud and unbowed until suffering unsustainable damage during a major ice storm this February. While Augusta officials described the tree's loss as ""difficult news to accept"" and have begun deliberations as to how best replace it, Palmer believes Eisenhower, who died in 1969 aged 78, would have had a different viewpoint. ""I'm sure it did not make him unhappy that it was gone,"" he laughs. ""But I think it was sort of a love-hate relationship. I think he got a kick out of complaining about the tree because it gave him a lot of trouble. ""On the other hand, it was part of Augusta and a very important part."" Palmer himself actually hit the famous tree en route to winning one of his Masters titles, but there may be no such trouble in future for one of his grandchildren. Sam Saunders, now 26, turned pro three years ago and is fighting to return to his best form after losing his PGA Tour card after a disappointing 2013. Appropriately enough, he made his first PGA appearance at last month's Arnold Palmer Invitational -- tying 43rd but beating the likes of K.J. Choi, Padraig Harrington and Chad Campbell nonetheless. ""He's a young man and he's certainly getting some experience on playing professional golf,"" says his grandfather, who followed him around the course in a buggy. ""He's got a lot of challenges: a family he has to take care of, his game and winning. These are all major obstacles for him and things he must do to enjoy the game and his career as a professional golfer. ""He has the opportunity, but it's going to take a lot of hard work."" Something that Palmer, who ended a 59-year professional career at the age of 77, knows all about.","The Masters has been biggest boost to golf in United States, says Arnold Palmer .

"(CNN) -- As part of revamped security following last year's deadly bombings, the Boston Marathon has banned various items for the 2014 race, including bags and strollers. The bombs placed in backpacks exploded near the finish line last year, killing three people. Backpacks, handbags, suitcases and similar items are prohibited from entering any marathon venues this year. So are containers with more than 1 liter of liquid, costumes covering the face, and bulky clothes such as vests with pockets. Runners cannot take the items anywhere near the 26-mile course, organizer Boston Athletic Association said in a statement Wednesday. Marathoners will be allowed to carry clear, plastic bags provided by the organizers. They can also run with small fanny packs for medication and cell phones, and fuel belts that hold a bottle under one liter. Large flags or signs bigger than 11 inches x 17 inches are also banned from marathon venues. Marathon venues include the start and finish areas, the course, athletes' village and areas where official events are held. Unregistered runners and cyclists, who jump into the race along various points, are not welcome this year, either. ""We are aware that many people want to participate in some way in this year's Boston Marathon as a display of support,"" the statement said. ""But we ask that those who are not official participants to refrain from entering the course for the safety of the runners and themselves."" On April 15 last year, double bombings hit the Boston Marathon, which attracts elite runners from all over the world. They exploded within 12 seconds of each other. Three people died and 264 others were injured. Two brothers, Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, are suspected of planting the homemade bombs near the finish line. The latter faces a potential death penalty and appears in court in November. His brother was killed in a police shootout shortly after the bombings.

"(CNN) -- At the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the passage of the Civil Rights Act, four presidents remembered the battles and honored those who fought to form ""a more perfect union"" on the path to economic, educational and voting equality. But, for one of those heroes, it was also a time to pause and acknowledge the progress. And for one president, it was a time to honor another. The four presidents -- Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama -- led the observances, appropriately, at the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library in Austin. It was President Johnson who in 1964 secured the passage of the Civil Rights Act, and in 1965, the Voting Rights Act -- the latter eviscerated last year by the Roberts Court. President Obama thanked ""the warriors for justice, the elected officials and community leaders who are here today."" Those who ended segregation and ushered in the most significant change in America since the Civil War were indeed, ""warriors for justice."" One of the warriors present was Rep. John Lewis who was in his 20s when the battles for Civil Rights were raging across the South, and indeed, all America. Lewis was attacked dozens of times. The bus he was riding was firebombed in Anniston, Alabama. He suffered a fractured skull from a policeman's club on the Selma Bridge and was beaten unconscious in a Montgomery bus station. It was men and women warriors like Lewis who first moved Americans, and then moved the federal government, to guarantee the basic human rights they demanded. The rights were as simple as ordering a sandwich and drink at a lunch counter, and as profound as being able to vote. Introducing the President, Lewis said, ""President Barack Obama was born into a dangerous and difficult time in American history, a time when people were arrested and taken to jail just for sitting beside each other on the bus."" ""When people say nothing has changed, I say come and walk in my shoes, and I will show you change."" President Obama keyed his theme to honor President Johnson. ""Because of the civil rights movement, because of the laws that Lyndon Johnson passed, new doors swung open,"" he said. ""I have lived out the promise of LBJ's efforts. ... Michelle has lived out the legacy of those efforts. ... My daughters have lived out the legacy of those efforts."" Doors swung open, Obama said, ""not all at once, but they swung open. Not just (for) blacks and whites, but also women and Latinos; and Asians and Native Americans."" ""In a time when cynicism is too often passed off as wisdom, it's perhaps easy to conclude that there are limits to change; that we are trapped by our own history; and politics is a fool's errand,"" he said, adding, ""I reject such cynicism."" We ""cannot be complacent,"" he said. ""Our rights, our freedoms -- they are not given. They must be won."" Obama added, ""We remain locked in this same great debate about equality and opportunity."" Earlier in the week, former President Jimmy Carter struck a similar theme: ""We still have gross disparity between black and white people on employment (and) the quality of education,"" said Carter. ""But we feel like, you know, Lyndon Johnson did it -- we don't have to do anything anymore. I think too many people are at ease with the still existing disparity."" Former President George W. Bush, who spoke at the conclusion of the Summit said, ""I fear that the soft bigotry of low expectations is returning, and for the sake of America's children, that is something we cannot allow."" Former President Bill Clinton homed in on the erosion of the Voting Rights Act, and partisan divisions. ""We all know what this is about: This is a way of restricting the franchise after 50 years of expanding it,"" Clinton said. ""Is this what Martin Luther King, Jr. gave his life for? Is this what Lyndon Johnson employed his legendary skills for?"" he asked. ""I am concerned that on this 50th anniversary, these divisions and the lack of a spirit of coming together put us back in the dustbin of old history,"" Clinton said. Obama echoed Clinton, saying, ""One concern I have sometimes during these moments (is that) from a distance, sometimes ... they seem easy. All the pain and difficulty and struggle and doubt -- all that is rubbed away."" Bush reminded the audience about the importance of education in ensuring equality for all. ""It is not a coincidence that many of the defining struggles of the civil rights era -- from Little Rock Central to the University of Mississippi -- took place in educational settings. Those who engage in oppression and exploitation always deny real learning. Those who fight oppression always insist on equal education. Through civil rights laws, we assure justice in the present. Through education, we secure justice for the next generation."" There is still more work to do. More work by my generation, which includes the President. And more work by those coming up now. Obama exhorted young people especially not to succumb to despair or cynicism because the struggle seems too hard. ""We've got a debt to pay,"" he said. President Johnson ""believed that together we can build an America that is more fair, more equal, and more free than the one we inherited. He believed we make our own destiny. And in part because of him, we must believe it as well."" If we still believe, we shall overcome one day.

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- First came the whiteouts, then the blackouts. Utility companies scrambled Friday to restore power to the Northeast as hundreds of thousands shivered. A powerful snowstorm had moved Wednesday from the Midwest, arriving Thursday in the Northeast. It whacked a string of states along the way, dumping 13 inches of snow on Kansas, more than 10 inches on parts of Massachusetts and 4 inches on New York. In some areas, ice snapped tree limbs and downed power lines, causing massive blackouts. In Philadelphia alone, electric provider PECO said early Friday that 319,000 homes and businesses were without power. In Pennsylvania's Chester County, some traffic lights were powered by portable generators, CNN affiliate KFW reported. The vast majority of those who lost their power should see it restored Friday, though some may have to wait until Sunday, company spokeswoman Debbie Yemenijian said. Utility crews from Arkansas, Illinois, Massachusetts, New York, Ohio and Canada joined PECO's workers to fix the damage, the company said. In all, more than 1,500 workers were in the field, it said. In the Baltimore area, about 19,000 homes and businesses remained without power early Friday, utility Baltimore Gas and Electric Co. said on its website. Tens of thousands more were without power elsewhere in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, with a handful of outages remaining in Ohio as well. By Friday evening, more than 270,000 customers were still with power in the Mid-Atlantic states. The wet, heavy snow may have pleased children who got a snow day, but some grownups were not applauding. ""Harder to push, not as easy actually to plow,"" said Boston snowplow driver Nick Sfravara. ""It's definitely a challenge to get this stuff out of the way rather than the light stuff."" Another system is forecast to bring snow to the region this weekend, but it's not expected to produce as many problems, CNN meteorologists said. On the West Coast, much-needed rain and snow should continue through the weekend. In Washington State, one person was killed and several others injured in a 28-car crash on Interstate 5 in Washington state after a new winter storm blew in off the Pacific, CNN affiliate KPTV reported. Portland, Oregon, got 3.8 inches of snow on Thursday, the fifth-greatest February snowfall since 1940. Thursday was also the coldest day in February since 1989, with a high of 23 degrees. A second round of snow is expected to fall Friday afternoon, according to KPTV. San Francisco received nearly three quarters of an inch of rain on Thursday. Another several inches are expected in the inland valleys and 8 to 10 inches in the coastal mountains through the weekend, bringing the possibility of flooding. Snow showers from the Midwest to the Northeast were expected to drop 2 to 4 inches of snow from the Midwest to the Northeast over the weekend. Cold air will hang on through the weekend, with highs 10 to 20 degreess below average. Another round of cold is expected to move Sunday into the Upper Midwest, with highs predicted at 30 degrees below average.

"(CNN) -- The body of an 8-year-old girl who was abducted Friday night from a Walmart in Jacksonville, Florida, was discovered Saturday morning, police said. ""This is a transition from an abduction investigation to a murder investigation,"" Jacksonville Sheriff's Office spokesman Shannon Hartley told reporters. ""Obviously, we have the unfortunate answer that we didn't want to have."" Donald James Smith, 56, faces kidnapping and murder charges. He was listed as being held without bond Saturday night. Smith is a registered sex offender who was released from custody on May 31, according to Michael Williams, director of the sheriff's investigations department. Authorities from the sheriff's office had just made contact with him to verify his address on Friday morning, Williams said. Later that same day, a woman called police to report that her daughter was missing from the Walmart. Authorities initially called on the public to help find Cherish Lilly Perrywinkle, who had been wearing an orange sundress, purple flip-flops and a pink ribbon when she went missing. After the investigation revealed that the girl had been abducted, an Amber Alert was activated, Hartley said. He identified Smith, ""a man with a very extensive criminal history"" that included a kidnapping conviction, as a suspect. Williams said the girl's mother first met Smith on Friday night at a local Dollar General store, where he offered to take the family to Walmart to buy them some clothes. ""After being inside the store for a couple hours, the man then offered to buy some hamburgers,"" Williams told reporters. ""As he walked to the front of the store, he took our 8-year-old victim with him. They walked to the front of the Walmart toward the McDonald's. They did not stop at the McDonald's. They walked outside, got in his van and left the location."" On Saturday morning, police stopped Smith, 56, as he drove a white van southbound on I-95 in Jacksonville and detained him without incident, Hartley said. ""Obviously, having Mr. Smith in custody is a huge break for us,"" he said as the search for the girl was continuing. ""We are very confident that he was the one that took her from the Walmart."" Soon after, Hartley said in a subsequent news conference, police followed a lead that took them four miles from the Walmart to a church, near which the child's body was discovered. According to records from the Duval County Clerk of Courts, Smith's most recent convictions occurred last year on charges from 2009 for unlawful impersonation of a public employee and aggravated child abuse by willful torture, for which he was sentenced to a year in county jail. ""The first thing I would tell you is, as a parent, hug your children closely right now and know where they're at,"" Hartley said. ""Just pay attention to them, keep them close.""","NEW: Donald James Smith, 56, faces charges .

"(CNN) -- That moment when you first learn to balance on a bike has to be similar to how a bird feels learning to fly. When you're four or five years old and the training wheels come off, fear has been replaced by possibility. Many of us have done the college tour of hostels in Europe or perhaps a grown-up weekend getaway to Paris. But biking trips through lesser-explored regions of Europe are becoming more popular as travelers seek to not only immerse themselves in the culture, but also pursue personal goals of health and a feeling of accomplishment. A European bike tour at its best is rolling hills and roads that hug lakes, mountains and fields. Castles and vineyards rise and fall in the distance as hill climbs give way to exhilarating, breezy rides down. The reward after 15, 30, maybe 45 miles a day of riding? A great dinner and a glass of local wine to soothe sore muscles, and trading stories with fellow riders. 8 religious wonders in the U.S. As you read, the 2012 Tour de France is under way and leaders have emerged in the cutting-edge race. Armchair viewers wince at the tortuous mountain climbs and breathe sighs of relief at easy downhills. Riders are pedaling toward an always epic finish line on July 22 on Paris' Champs-Elysees. While it's possible to follow parts of the Tour de France route, the best routes for amateur riders have little traffic, great beauty and minimal hills. It's best to have at least some experience on a bike, but each of these companies can help you better gauge what level of ride is right for you. And don't worry -- there's always back-up support, complete with a van, in case you need it. Check out these five tours for miles of beautiful amateur riding: . Ciclismo Classico's Ireland . It seems travelers dream of Ireland more than other countries, perhaps because so many have roots there. The Ireland that we seek can be found on its Western Coast, and biking it gets you deep into the country. And of course, to pubs for a pint or two. ""The Irish are renowned storytellers, but nothing tells the story of Ireland better than cycling the breathtaking landscapes of the West Coast. From the soaring Cliffs of Moher to the atmospheric peat bogs of Connemara National Park, the wild heart of Ireland is one of the most rewarding cycling trips in all of Europe,"" said Lauren Hefferon, who founded Ciclismo Classico in 1989. Tanzania: Take a ride on the wild side . The tour takes you to Galway, the rocky land of the Burren, the live music capital of Doolin, the stunning Aran Islands and to unspoiled Connemara. Priced from $4,295 for 8 days/7 nights. BikeSherpa's Dresden Bike and Beer Tour . On September 11, 2001, the New York offices of Robert Reimann's company, Sherpa Corp., were destroyed in the terrorist attacks against the United States. Reimann decided to explore the Middle East on a solo bike trip to Iran, and his inspiration for BikeSherpa was born. ""There's no better (or more fun) way of traveling than by bicycle,"" he said via e-mail. The Dresden Germany Bike & Beer Tour takes riders along the car-free Elbe River bike path, the most popular bike path in Germany. The itinerary includes stops at quintessential ""biergartens"" and cafes, with other visits in historic but lesser-known cities like Dresden, Meissen and Pirna. Reimann maintains a close relationship with hotels and local guides, which helps him keep prices fair while offering great accommodations, he said. For beginners, there is the option of using an e-bike with a motor and rechargeable battery that helps you climb hills if you need it. Priced from $1,598 for 6 days/5 nights. Trek Travel's Provence Explorer . Trek Travel was born from Trek Bicycles, which was founded in 1976 and is now one of the more popular bike retailers in the world. Trek Travel says that traveling by bike allows you to become part of a region rather than just moving through it, and it offers bike tours all over the world, including itineraries in Latin America, Europe, North America and Asia. The Provence Explorer tour celebrates a slower pace of life, with a cooking class after shopping at a local market, and riding through sweeping French landscapes. For those wanting an extra challenge, there is the option to climb Mont Ventoux, a mountain made famous by being part of the Tour de France. Priced from $2,795 for 6 days/5 nights. DuVine Adventures' Mallorca . For the amateur cyclist, the island of Mallorca in Spain is close to perfect -- easy rolling seaside roads, little traffic and a temperate, sunny climate year-round. Plus, many of the world's best cyclists have pedaled the island, where more than half of the roads are designated cycling routes. DuVine Adventures' Mallorca trip takes riders on these roads, through orange groves, small villages and romantic countryside. ""The terrain on Mallorca is diverse, which makes it perfect for couples and families, as there is something for everyone,"" said owner Andy DuVine. This tour involves stays in exceptional hotels, including La Residencia in the foothills of the Tramuntana mountains, where Richard Branson has been spotted, and Cap Rocat, a former military fortress that now overlooks the Bay of Palma. Priced from $4,995 for 6 days/5 nights. Austin-Lehman's Danish Isles Bike Tour . Touring the Danish Isles by bike is a natural fit for travelers, as cycling plays such a big role in Danish culture. ""The numbers tell it all:  Out of 1.2 million residents, roughly 500,000 commuters choose to bike to work each day in Copenhagen! The infrastructure seems as if it were custom-made for cyclists. Some of the bike lanes are as wide as car lanes,"" said Ron van Dijk, director of European operations for Austin-Lehman Adventures. This tour takes riders to palaces, castles, museums, beaches and gorgeous mountain vistas with stops in Copenhagen, Helsingor, Svendborg and Faaborg and multiple opportunities to interact with the famously friendly Danes. Priced from $3,998 for 8 days/7 nights.","These five routes are less punishing than the Tour de France .

"(CNN) -- About a decade ago, while walking through the spring training clubhouse of the then-Florida Marlins, a third baseman summoned me toward his locker and -- pants down, while changing out of his uniform -- farted in my face. I did not know the man. He did not know me. He simply thought, in some odd way, that farting into a stranger's face constituted good humor. And, amazingly, it did. Teammates laughed and laughed and laughed. Ultimately, a catcher I'd interviewed before walked up, tapped me on the shoulder and said, ""Typical bull----."" Indeed. The professional athlete who breaks wind in a man's face is not an anomaly. Neither is the athlete who -- as a joke -- sticks a pornographic film in the clubhouse TV's DVD player. Or the one who gives a teammate a wedgie. Or a purple nurple. Or tells racist jokes. Or sexist jokes. Or ... you name it. Really, name anything. That's why, as the world -- in and out of sporting -- chatters over the 144-page report commissioned by the NFL to explore allegations of bullying within the Miami Dolphins, I can't help but sigh, shrug and accept the reality that -- even with Richie Incognito's warranted public flogging, even with Michael Sam's announcement of his homosexuality, even with continued societal enlightenment -- little will change. As anyone who has spent time covering athletics will tell you, life in a male professional clubhouse is often akin to the worst fraternity on campus -- minus the rules, regulations and governing bodies. There is a caste system, but it has little to do with the most intelligent and mature rising to the top. Here, the skinny backup quarterback who attended, say, Harvard or Northwestern gains no points for his pedigree. The strong debater or the Tolstoy fan isn't considered a guide or guru. No, this is the heartland of Richie Incognitos -- large, loud, oafish dunderheads who would be branded bullies elsewhere but are here leaders. As the NFL report detailed, Incognito and Co. appeared to take a sadistic pleasure in torturing Jonathan Martin, a teammate considered to be weak. Ted Wells, a defense lawyer who investigated the scandal and produced the report for the NFL, called it ""a classic case of bullying, where persons who are in a position of power harass the less powerful"" -- and truer words have rarely been written. Martin was mocked racially, mocked sexually, subjected to obscene jokes about his sister and mother. Another teammate, according to the report, was besieged with homophobic taunts and touched in a ""mockingly suggestive manner."" This is awful. This is not particularly surprising. Truth be told, the world of professional team sports is about as open-minded as a corpse. Yes, blacks and whites and Hispanics and Asians come together to fight for a common goal. Winning. Once the final whistle or buzzer sounds (or the last out is recorded), the ""Kumbaya"" spirit evaporates, and everyone wanders off into their groups and corners. Many go about their lives. Some -- the meek -- cower. Others -- the Incognitos -- pounce. They do so for the simple reason that others before them have also done so -- no one dares stand in the way. I vividly recall covering the San Francisco Giants when Barry Bonds was the team's star. He was (to be blunt) an awful man to others -- rude to teammates, dismissive to fans, crude to the media and indifferent to Giants employees. When a San Francisco front office executive or public relations official would tiptoe up to Bonds with a question or request, he would be unceremoniously rebuffed. He might technically have held the power, but Bonds was bigger, stronger, more famous, more important -- and his way became the way. No matter what the so-called experts say on the morning talk shows (and Lord knows, it'd be helpful if some of them ever even stepped foot inside a locker room), that's how it goes in sports. Unless pro sports commissioners Roger Goodell, Bud Selig, Adam Silver and Gary Bettman make a concerted effort to begin enforcing better behavior in their sports' respective locker rooms, that's how it will always go in sports. And the Richie Incognitos will continue to rule the terrain. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeff Pearlman.","Jeff Pearlman: NFL report on bullying among Dolphins horrified many but shouldn't .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Prosecutors presented evidence at a hearing this week for three Al Jazeera English journalists accused of terrorist activity in Egypt, but they did little to explain why everyday broadcast equipment and the defendants' personal belongings would implicate them in any crime. The three journalists at this second hearing are among 20 defendants authorities have charged with crimes; the Qatar-based Al Jazeera says only eight have worked for the network. The trial has drawn international condemnation from human rights groups, who say the arrests indicate authorities in Egypt are stifling dissent and freedom of the press. The case comes amid a crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood after the ouster of Egypt's first democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsy. The accused have denied the allegations against them, with the journalists saying they were simply doing their jobs. Detained Al Jazeera journalists appear in court as trial opens . In what was at times a bizarre and confused proceeding Wednesday, a lead investigator took the stand as the state's first witness but refused to answer several questions, saying he could not divulge a secret government source. At one point the witness told the court he could not remember certain details of his investigation. ""What we saw in court today was ridiculous,"" said Adel Fahmy, brother of jailed Al Jazeera English producer Mohamed Fahmy. ""It showed that the government has no case and these journalists are innocent."" Fahmy, producer Baher Mohamed and award-winning correspondent Peter Greste, an Australian, were arrested December 29 at a Cairo hotel room and later charged with joining a terrorist organization, broadcasting false information and working in Egypt without permits. The three have been denied bail and kept in detention for more than two months. Among the evidence the state claims to have is video of news reports, allegedly fabricated by the Al Jazeera journalists. Fahmy's defense attorney demanded for the reports to be viewed in court and complained the court did not have the equipment necessary to show the video. He also questioned the credibility of statements written by state witnesses because the wording of each was identical. Wednesday's proceeding drew sharp criticism and mocking statements on social media from journalists covering the trial. ""Watching judge unseal a steady stream of evidence, often having to use his pen or a lighter, was farcical. This trial is a huge embarrassment,"" tweeted Cairo-based freelance journalist Louisa Loveluck. Throughout the hearing, the defendants were kept in a caged dock steps away from their family members. On several occasions, the judge gave them permission to address the court. ""I would never betray my country,"" Fahmy told the court. From inside the cage, Greste told reporters he was angry ""that we spent two months in prison for such flimsy evidence."" The trial was adjourned until March 24.","""What we saw in court today was ridiculous,"" brother of one accused journalist says .

"(CNN) -- As one of the warmest cities in Russia -- a country with no shortage of snowy terrain -- Sochi seems an unusual place to host the Winter Olympics. But that's not all that's notable about it. It's also the latest hot spot for dacha-seeking oligarchs -- and President Putin. Plus it has gay bars (despite President Putin). And Cossacks. Not necessarily in the gay bars, though. 1. Anyone who's anyone (or who can afford it) has a dacha there . The infamous Russian who put the ""Russian Riviera"" city on the map wasn't quite the hair-shirted leader you might expect. Communist dictator Joseph Stalin popularized Sochi after building a summer dacha -- Russian vacation home -- here in the 1930s. In the years since, the destination has become a summering spot for a succession of Russian politicos -- all the way up to President Putin, who has two dachas in Sochi. Sochi dachas have also become increasingly in demand from the ultra-rich so-called oligarchs who divided up much of the Russian economy among themselves with the downfall of the Soviet Union. The popularity of the resort among the wealthy and powerful has led to criticisms that it's become unaffordable to the ordinary Russians who flocked to the city after its establishment as a vacation spot in the 1950s. You can tour the dacha that launched the locale, complete with a wax version of the ""Man of Steel,"" avuncular pipe in hand. Stalin's Dacha, Kurortny Prospekt 120, Khostinsky District; +7 (862) 267 05 02; tours - $10 -- by appointment . 2. The Sochi Olympics aren't actually happening in Sochi . The Sochi Olympics aren't taking place in Sochi proper, which technically consists of one 32-square-kilometer district called Tsentralny. Instead, athletes are competing in Adler, an area within Greater Sochi just north of Georgia's breakaway territory, Abkhazia. A coastal cluster of venues south of Sochi proper house the Central Olympic Stadium and rink sports including ice hockey, curling and figure skating. Outdoor events such as skiing and bobsleighing are being hosted within the Krasnaya Polyana resort area, about 50 kilometers away in the Western Caucasus Mountains. 3. Restaurants and bars will be smoke-free . In Russia, you're never far from a cigarette lighter. Back in October, that was a lucky strike for the Olympics when a man whipped one from his pocket and quickly replenished the Olympic flame, which had blown out in the wind. But the Sochi Olympics have committed to a smoke-free event, making it the 12th Games to do so. This will be a trial in a country still in love with smoking -- nearly 60% of adult males and 40% of the total adult population admitted to smoking regularly in 2012, according to the World Health Organization. The sale of cigarettes and smoking itself have been banned inside any Sochi Olympic venue, with the exception of specially marked smoke zones. Smoking is also forbidden at bars and restaurants within the Olympic Park -- a step ahead of the nation. Russia barred smoking in public spaces including airports and train stations last June, and will expand the ban to include cafÃ©s, bars and restaurants in June 2014. It will also impose a minimum price (so long $2 packs), all in an effort to quell smoking-related deaths in Russia, which totaled 400,000 in 2012. 4. Sochi has gay bars . There are no gay people in Sochi, according to mayor Anatoly Pakhomov. Curiously enough, however, there are gay bars -- at least one that's out of the closet, that is. Sochi's Cabaret Mayak, catering to both gay and straight clients, features a midnight show by transvestite cabaret singers. Despite homosexuality being a federal crime in Russia until 1993, Sochi was a gay hub during Soviet times for its relaxed beachfront vibe and distance from major metropolises within the Iron Curtain. In July, President Putin signed into law a ban on ""gay propaganda,"" criminalizing the spread of information on ""nontraditional sexual relations"" among minors. He's since lowered his sword, saying gay people will be welcome at the 2014 Olympic Games but adding in a January 17 comment to a group of Olympic volunteers: ""Please leave the children at peace."" Cabaret Mayak, Sokolova ul. 1, Khostinsky District; +7 (988) 238 30 40; open daily, year round; 21+ . 5. Sochi trained Russia's first space monkeys . It's a symbol of the 1960s Cold War space race etched into our collective imagination: a monkey, in full astronaut attire, manning a spacecraft. Leading the way in Russia's monkey-manned space technology? Sochi, of course. Russia's first space monkeys, Abrek and Bion, were trained at a Sochi ""apery"" for their seven-day mission in December of 1983. The Monkey Nursery Center (Vesyoloe 1, Adler District; + 7 (862) 241 62 39; call for tours -- $7) is open to visitors curious to tour the training and testing facility, or just hang with 2,700 apes. 6. Cossacks patrol the streets . Their tall lamb's wool hats, emblazoned coats and flamboyant dance style have earned Cossacks a place in the world's vision of Russia, with help from Russian literary icons Leo Tolstoy and Alexander Pushkin. Now, the once feared horsemen who secured the frontier for Russian tsars have joined forces with police patrolling Sochi. Russia and the Cossacks have a patchy history. After centuries as allies of Russia, the east Slavic people suffered harshly under the communists for their opposition to the Red Army. But since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cossacks have gradually returned to popular favor in Russia. Echoing the mid-19th-century Caucasian War when Cossacks served as border guards, current governor Aleksandr Tkachev of Sochi's Krasnodar region hired a thousand fur-clad Cossacks to help to secure the Olympic Games. Cossacks make up only a small fraction of the approximately 40,000 security forces at the Olympics. 7. It might not be vodka in that shot glass . Russia's toasting rules are complicated. What, or whom, to toast changes with each clink, but one constant remains: vodka. In Sochi, however, vodka is often swapped for its fruitier Caucasian counterpart, chacha, a Georgian pomace brandy, often distilled like moonshine (so if you aim to taste, you're advised to look for safer, bottled varieties). Similar to Italian grappa, chacha takes on the flavor of the grape skins and walnut shells often infused with the liquor. Georgian lore claims chacha has healing qualities, easing earaches and indigestion. Just like vodka. 8. The cuisine may be Armenian and Georgian . Sochi, which underwent multi-ethnic colonization in the 19th century, may technically be all-Russian now, but its food remains diverse. With Armenians accounting for 20% of the city's population, and close proximity to Georgia, Sochi offers an impressive sampling of cuisine beyond the dill and sour cream of traditional Russian fare. You'll find authentic Armenian at kitschy Amshensky Dvor (Krasnoflotskaya ul. 15, Adler District; +7 (862) 295 51 21; open daily, year round) part of the largest private museum of Caucasian artifacts and history. Chefs make wood-fired lavash bread and clay-pot stews. A Georgian favorite is Ne Goryuy (Riversky per. 6-Ð° Sochi Khostinsky District; +7 (918) 406 41 04; open daily, rear round), known for its chakhokhbili -- chicken in garlic sauce -- and its quiet location off the seashore. 9. Sochi overlaps with a UNESCO World Heritage Site . Olympics visitors can enter the Caucasian Biosphere Reserve, a UNESCO World Heritage Site that partially overlaps with Sochi National Park in the Western Caucasus. The Yew and Boxwood grove -- the biosphere spot most easily accessible from Sochi -- features 1,000-year-old trees and plant relics from prehistoric times. One of the largest protected areas in Europe, the preserve has around 30 endemic mammals including the Caucasian bison and the Persian leopard, currently being reintroduced to the region and also a mascot for the Sochi Olympics.

"(CNN) -- The first officially sanctioned ivory auction in nearly a decade happened Tuesday in Namibia, with opinion split on whether the sale will help or hurt efforts to stop elephant poaching. The Namibian government sold almost eight tons of ivory for $1.2 million, said Willem Wijnstekers, the secretary-general of CITES, the international agreement covering the trade of endangered species. Supporters say the auction will provide cash for elephant conservation. Opponents say it will stimulate the demand for ivory. Buyers came from China and Japan, with the Chinese buying nearly 4.2 tons and the Japanese buying 3.7 tons, said Wijnstekers, who spoke to CNN from the auction in the Namibian capital of Windhoek. The auctioned ivory consisted of whole elephant tusks and pieces of tusks in various sizes, he said. Nearly 10 tons had been available for sale in Namibia, and the pieces that were not sold were the worst-quality pieces that will now be kept by the government or destroyed, he said. The sale was the first of four approved by the secretariat of CITES, which stands for the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. First adopted in 1963, the agreement now has 173 signatories. The last such ivory auction happened in 1999. Another auction is planned for Botswana later this week, and for Zimbabwe and South Africa next week, said Juan-Carlos Vasquez, a spokesman for CITES in Geneva, Switzerland. The auctions involve all of the stocks of government-owned ivory, all deemed to be of legal origin, he said. That means the ivory comes not from poaching or confiscation, but from animals that died naturally or -- in the case of South Africa -- from the period before 1994 when elephant culling was allowed, Vasquez said. China and Japan are the only approved customers for the auctions, Vasquez said. They were the two nations that expressed an interest in the ivory and fulfilled the conditions set by CITES to allow its trade. Under the agreement, proceeds from the auctions must be used exclusively for elephant conservation and community development programs in or near elephants' range in the four countries, said a statement from CITES, which is administered by the United Nations Environment Program. In Namibia, for example, some of the money will be spent in communities that have problems with elephants destroying crops or killing people, Wijnstekers said. ""The revenues are expected to boost the countries' capacity to conserve biodiversity, strengthen enforcement controls and contribute to the livelihoods of the rural people in southern Africa,"" a CITES statement said. ""All this without affecting negatively African and Asian elephant populations."" Conservation groups, however, have expressed doubts that the auctions will do anything but encourage poaching and the illegal killing of elephants. The sale ""will stimulate, not satisfy, the massive demand for ivory in countries like China,"" Will Travers, chief executive of the Born Free Foundation, told CNN. ""It will do nothing to re-educate customers (in China and Japan) that buying ivory is signing an elephant's death warrant."" The four auctions taking place over the next two weeks may also encourage other countries with elephant populations to hold their own ivory sales, especially now that they have seen the proceeds Tuesday's sale generated for the Namibian government, Travers said. The Environmental Investigation Agency, an independent environmental campaign group, expressed a similar fear. EIA Campaigns Director Julian Newman told CNN the ivory market will fail to see the auctions as one-time sales of legal stocks and instead simply see the reemergence of ivory on the market. ""By opening it up to a legal trade, it will just stimulate that (ivory) market further,"" Newman said from the EIA's London office. The International Fund for Animal Welfare said a legal ivory trade allows poachers to launder their stocks of illegal ivory. Travers and Newman said they don't believe CITES' safeguards on China and Japan are strong enough to prevent the illegal ivory trade. More than 108 tons of ivory remain to be auctioned in the next three sales, CITES said. Botswana plans to auction 48 tons; Zimbabwe plans to sell slightly more than four tons; and South Africa plans to sell more than 56 tons.","Controversial legal auction of ivory held in Namibia .

"Washington (CNN) -- The fact that Chris Christie rolled to a second term in New Jersey and Terry McAuliffe won in Virginia wasn't a surprise. Public opinion polls have consistently shown both men in the lead. But the exit polls showed two very different paths to victory. Christie steamrolled hapless Democratic nominee Barbara Buono, 60% to 39% with 80% of the vote counted, crushing her in almost every key demographic. It was the biggest victory for a GOP gubernatorial candidate in New Jersey since Tom Kean was running in the 1980s. What Christie's victory means for 2016 . McAuliffe's victory was much narrower than most of the polls indicated, 48% to 46% with 98% of the vote in. He didn't win every key group -- self-described independents broke for Republican nominee Ken Cuccinelli -- but he successfully stoked fears about Cuccinelli's strident brand of conservatism in an increasingly moderate battleground state. Let's start with New Jersey. Christie beat his female opponent among women by 16 points. He won self-described moderates by more than 20 points. He won independents by more than 30 points. He won voters making less than $50,000. He won voters making more than $100,000. Check the exit poll: N.J. governor's race . Christie did very well for a Republican with core Democratic constituencies. He won 49% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29. He won roughly three in 10 self-described liberals. He won 50% of the Hispanic vote. And he won roughly 20% of the African-American vote. These are all critical selling points for Republicans hungry to take back the White House in 2016. If there's one warning sign for Christie's 2016 hopes, it's the fact that the exit polls show he would lose his home state to Hillary Clinton by four points. That doesn't fit with the narrative that he's a Republican capable of winning in blue America. Half of New Jersey voters said Christie would make a good president. But that doesn't mean 50% of New Jersey voters would necessarily back him if he runs for the White House. Christie will have to walk a fine line over the next couple of years, bolstering his standing among national GOP primary voters while maintaining his credibility with more independent and Democratic-leaning voters. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney couldn't do it. As for Virginia, McAuliffe won by getting his base to the polls. Democrats were the biggest partisan voting bloc in the state, comprising 37% of the total electorate and backing the former Democratic National Committee chairman by a 93-point margin. McAuliffe hit Cuccinelli hard during the campaign on hot button social issues like abortion, and the strategy paid off. Cuccinelli actually won among the 72% of voters who cared most about the economy or health care. But among the 20% of voters who called abortion the most important issue, McAuliffe won by 25 points, 59%-34%. Check the exit poll: Va. governor's race . Half of Virginia voters called Cuccinelli's issue positions too conservative. Only 41% called McAuliffe's positions too liberal. In the end, Cuccinelli was hurt by the same tea party alliance that won him the nomination at the Virginia GOP convention earlier this year. Only 28% of Virginia voters said they support the tea party movement. Forty-two percent said they oppose it, and they broke for McAuliffe by more than 70 points. And no, Cuccinelli can't blame his loss on scandal-plagued outgoing GOP Gov. Bob McDonnell or third-party libertarian candidate Robert Sarvis. Despite his scandals, Virginia voters said they approve of McDonnell's job performance by 11 points, 52% to 41%. And if Sarvis had not been in the race, exit polls indicate McAuliffe still would have beaten Cuccinelli by two points, 48% to 46%. 5 things we learned from Election Night .","Christie crushed his Democratic opponent in almost every demographic category .

"(CNN) -- North Korea on Thursday showed off a South Korean man it has detained on spying charges. The man, named as Kim Jung-wook, was presented to foreign journalists in Pyongyang, the Japanese news agency Kyodo reported. Speaking in front of reporters, Kim apologized for having carried out ""anti-state"" activities at the direction of South Korea's National Intelligence Service, according to Kyodo, which has a bureau in Pyongyang. He said he had worked as a missionary for several years on the Chinese side of the border with North Korea, running a church that sought North Korean converts. North Korea said in November that it had it had arrested an unidentified South Korean intelligence agent in Pyongyang who was planning to ""rally dishonest elements"" in North Korea and ""use them for undermining the stability of the social system."" Pyongyang said the agent had engaged in ""espionage and plot-breeding activities in a third country"" that borders North Korea while ""disguising himself as a religionist."" Seeking clarity . It wasn't immediately clear how much of what Kim told reporters Thursday was grounded in truth. North Korea is known to push detainees to make false confessions. Merrill Newman, an American veteran of the Korean War detained by North Korea last year, said that he was made to deliver an ""apology"" on state media that was not his own words. The South Korean Unification Ministry said Thursday it had been asking North Korea for information about the South Korean citizen since Pyongyang's announcement in November. But it said it hadn't received any information until Kim's appearance Thursday. ""We strongly request the release of the South Korean citizen as soon as possible,"" said Unification Ministry spokesman Kim Eui-do. The South's National Intelligence Service said it had nothing to do with Kim Jung-wook's case. A slight thaw . Kim's appearance in Pyongyang comes amid a slight thaw in North-South relations. The two countries just held reunions of families separated by the Korean War for the first time since 2010. North Korea is currently known to be holding two foreign missionaries: Korean-American Kenneth Bae, 45, who has been in detention since November 2012; and the 75-year-old Australian John Short who was detained earlier this month. North Korea has a number of state-controlled churches, but the authoritarian Communist regime doesn't tolerate independent religious activities. The regime ""considers the spread of Christianity a particularly serious threat, since it challenges ideologically the official personality cult and provides a platform for social and political organization and interaction outside the realm of the state,"" a United Nations panel said in a report released this week. ""People caught practicing Christianity are subject to severe punishments in violation of the right to freedom of religion and the prohibition of religious discrimination,"" the report by the United Nations Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in North Korea said. CNN's Judy Kwon, Tim Schwarz and Yoko Wakatsuki contributed to this report.","A South Korean man is presented to foreign journalists in Pyongyang .

"(CNN) -- Anyone who has ever been unemployed understands that unemployment insurance is a lifeline for the jobless and their families. But that lifeline is now slipping away for the long-term unemployed, as cuts to federal unemployment extensions enacted by Congress earlier this year gradually take hold. Since February, more than 400,000 workers in 25 states have lost access to the federal Extended Benefits program, which previously provided a final 13 to 20 weeks of unemployment insurance to the longest-term unemployed. Another 70,000 unemployed workers in New York, West Virginia, and Washington, D.C., are on the chopping block for June. By the time the program is phased out in September, half a million workers in 35 states will have lost these crucial final weeks of unemployment insurance. On top of that, the other federal unemployment extension program -- Emergency Unemployment Compensation, which currently helps 2.6 million Americans with 34 to 53 weeks of benefits â€” will be dramatically scaled back beginning in June. The retrenchment in this program will immediately harm workers in 24 states, and will reduce or cut off benefits for hundreds of thousands of jobless Americans over the rest of the year. Most alarmingly, those workers who lose jobs in July and thereafter may end up with no federal help if the program permanently expires at the end of the year as scheduled. These figures don't even account for the millions of workers who have already run out of all state and federal unemployment insurance and still cannot find work. The cuts to unemployment insurance are coming way faster than the rate at which the economy is improving. Newly released employment figures show that the U.S. added only 69,000 jobs in May, and the unemployment rate has risen to 8.2% from 8.1%. Jobs remain scarce, with more than three job seekers for every one opening. But what distinguishes this last recession and its slow recovery is the unprecedented level of long-term unemployment. Of our nation's more than 12.7 million unemployed, more than 5 million -- 42% -- have been out of work for six months or longer. Nearly one in three have been out of work for more than a year. The average unemployed worker has been out of work for 39.7 weeks, or roughly nine months. Most state unemployment insurance programs cover the first 26 weeks, or six months, of unemployment, normally enough time for the vast majority of unemployed to find new work. But this was no ordinary recession. With long-term unemployment so severe, Congress acted in 2009 to expand the federal unemployment programs, ultimately extending benefits to up to 99 weeks in the states with the highest unemployment rates. Since then, the recession officially came to an end and the fledgling recovery has sputtered along, but long-term unemployment remains a problem that just won't go away. Congress and the administration seem hard-pressed to agree to do anything constructive about it, however. As the problem persisted, political scrapping about unemployment insurance has increased, and in February, Congress enacted a plan to dramatically scale back federal unemployment benefits, the consequences of which we are seeing now. We are pulling the rug out from under the unemployed too soon, to the detriment of unemployed workers and their families. Never before has Congress cut back on extended unemployment insurance when the unemployment rate remains so high. Today, less than half of the unemployed in this country are receiving unemployment insurance, and that percentage is decreasing rapidly. That puts more families at risk of falling into homelessness and poverty, and it means that one of the most effective forms of local economic stimulus isn't being used. Opponents of extended unemployment insurance argue that it prolongs joblessness and becomes a disincentive for finding work. It's a false claim that seizes on unfair stereotypes and stigmas of the unemployed, in the classic vein of blaming and punishing the victim. In fact, research shows that unemployment insurance helps keep jobless workers attached to the labor market so that they're not dropping out and giving up. And as we know from real life, surviving on the average weekly benefit of $300 is hardly a picnic. If the measure of a nation is how it treats its least fortunate, we are looking into the abyss. We need to think hard about whether we are prepared to relegate the long-term unemployed to the status of collateral damage in an economic catastrophe. If we are going to achieve a true recovery, we cannot leave the hardest-hit behind. What can our leaders in Washington do? They need to provide meaningful jobs programs and hiring incentives that target the long-term unemployed. They need to make it unlawful to discriminate against the unemployed in hiring. And they need to make sure, as long as the number of unemployed remains so high, that workers have the minimal income support that unemployment insurance can provide to keep their families going until they find that next job. We are not out of the woods. The recovery has eluded long-term unemployed Americans. For their sake, Congress must not allow what remains of federal unemployment insurance, the Emergency Unemployment Compensation program, to expire at the end of the year. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Christine Owens.","Unemployment insurance is set to expire for the long-term unemployed .

"(CNN) -- Fifty years ago, we stood at a moral crossroads as a nation. The day was June 11, 1963. That morning, then-Gov. George Wallace attempted to block integration of the University of Alabama with his futile ""stand at the schoolhouse door."" Hours later, civil rights leader Medgar Evers would be gunned down in the driveway of his home by a white supremacist. In between, my uncle, President John F. Kennedy, took to the airwaves in a historic televised address on civil rights -- one that would forever change the way our nation perceived the struggle for racial equality. ""We are confronted primarily with a moral issue,"" President Kennedy said that night, hours before Evers was killed. ""It is as old as the Scriptures and is as clear as the American Constitution. The heart of the question is whether all Americans are to be afforded equal rights and equal opportunities."" You can listen to his speech here. It was a seminal moment in our history. President Kennedy defined for the nation the struggle for equality not just as a constitutional or legal issue, but as a moral one as well. Five decades later, we're again at a crossroads as a country. As we mark the 50th anniversary of President Kennedy's famous speech, the question he asked the American people that evening from the Oval Office remains strikingly relevant -- shouldn't all Americans be afforded equal rights and equal opportunities? Sadly, when it comes to the treatment of people with mental illness, addiction and brain injury, equality remains unattained. In America in 2013, thousands of our fellow citizens are still marginalized. They are still discriminated against. They face stigma every day. Today, too many Americans are told that they're less entitled to health care than those who have diseases like diabetes or cancer or asthma, just because the origin of their illness is in their brain. Without equality, or parity, insurers can refuse to cover mental illnesses at the same level as other physical illnesses, making it harder for people to get well and often further isolating them in their struggle. Together, we must change that. Eliminating the stigma of mental illness -- and finally achieving parity for its treatment -- is the next chapter in America's civil rights movement. When I represented Rhode Island in Congress, I fought for the rights of people with mental illness, and was proud to sponsor -- along with my father, Sen. Ted Kennedy -- the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act to provide access to mental health treatment for tens of millions of Americans who previously were denied care. Signed into law by President Bush in 2008, this landmark legislation requires health insurers that offer coverage for mental illness and substance use disorders to provide those benefits in a no more restrictive way than all other medical and surgical procedures covered by the plan. This was a proud moment for me, but those with mental illnesses are still waiting for some pieces of this law to be implemented. For those with mental illness, this October marks another landmark 50th anniversary -- President Kennedy's signing into law of the historic Community Mental Health Act. This legislation, and the words he used to describe it, laid the foundation for contemporary mental health policy. These historic dates are important to remember, but as we look back, we are reminded not just of inspiration and achievement, but also where we have fallen short. Because while President Kennedy set us on the right course, the words he used to describe the insufficient attention and resources devoted to mental health in 1963 could still be said today: ""This situation has been tolerated far too long. It has troubled our national conscience -- but only as a problem unpleasant to mention, easy to postpone, and despairing of solution."" He then said, ""The time has come for a bold new approach."" This October, as we mark this important occasion, I am proud to launch the inaugural ""The Kennedy Forum,"" an annual event that will serve as a vehicle to honor President Kennedy's efforts, celebrate the progress made in the past half-century, and rededicate the entire mental health community to further progress. We have to eradicate the stigma of mental illness once and for all, and treat mental illness equal to other physical illnesses, so that all Americans can lead dignified lives and share in the benefits of our society. We are confronted with a moral issue but also a historic opportunity. We have the chance to take action and live up to the principle upon which America was founded: that all people are afforded equal rights and equal opportunities. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Patrick J. Kennedy.","50 years ago, President Kennedy defined civil rights and equality as a moral issue .

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Supreme Court will rule Thursday on the constitutionality of the sweeping health care law championed by President Barack Obama. The high court announced a series of other decisions on Monday, but not the most anticipated one. It announced that all remaining rulings for the year will come in three days. The stakes cannot be overstated -- what the justices decide will have an immediate and long-term impact on all Americans, both in how they get medicine and health care, and also in vast, yet unknown areas of ""commerce."" Saving this ruling for the final day ""may not be political, but they understand drama,"" said David Cole, a Georgetown University constitutional law professor. He added, ""It's also the most difficult case, the most important case, so they may want the extra few days to make sure that they're happy with their written opinions."" The nation's highest court heard three days of politically charged hearings in March on the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, a landmark but controversial measure passed by congressional Democrats despite pitched Republican opposition. The challenge focused primarily on the law's requirement that most Americans buy health insurance or pay a fine. Supporters of the plan argued the ""individual mandate"" is necessary for the system to work, while critics argued it is an unconstitutional intrusion on individual freedom. All sides preparing for political fallout from health care decision . Four different federal appeals courts heard challenges to parts of the law before the Supreme Court ruling, and came up with three different results. Courts in Cincinnati and Washington voted to uphold the law, while the appeals court in Atlanta struck down the individual mandate. A fourth panel, in Richmond, Virginia, put its decision off until penalties for failing to buy health insurance take effect in 2014. The polarizing law, dubbed ""Obamacare"" by many, is the signature legislation of Obama's time in office. After a lengthy and heated debate marked by intense opposition from the health insurance industry and conservative groups, the law passed Congress along strictly partisan lines in March 2010. When Obama signed the legislation later that month, he called it historic said it marked a ""new season in America."" While it was not the comprehensive national health care system liberals initially sought, supporters said the law would reduce health care costs, expand coverage and protect consumers. The law establishes a staged series of reforms over several years, including banning insurance companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, forbidding insurers from setting a dollar limit on health coverage payouts, and requiring them to cover preventative care at no additional cost to consumers. It also required individuals to buy health insurance, either through their employers or a state-sponsored exchange, or face a fine beginning in 2014. Supporters argue the individual mandate is critical to the success of the legislation, because it expands the pool of people paying for insurance and ensures that healthy people do not opt out of buying insurance until they needed it. Critics said the provision gave the government too much power over what they said should be a personal economic decision. Twenty-six states led by Florida say individuals cannot be forced to buy insurance, a ""product"" they may neither want nor need. And they argue that if that provision is unconstitutional, the entire law must go. The Justice Department countered that since every American will need medical care at some point in their lives, individuals do not ""choose"" whether to participate in the health care market. The partisan debate around such a sweeping piece of legislation has encompassed almost every traditional hot-button topic: abortion and contraception funding, state and individual rights, federal deficits, end-of-life care, and the overall economy. During arguments on March 27, Justice Anthony Kennedy said the law appeared to ""change the relationship between the government and the individual in a profound way."" Congress ready for high court's health care decisions -- then it gets tricky . Chief Justice John Roberts argued that ""all bets are off"" when it comes to federal government authority if Congress was found to have the authority to regulate health care in the name of commerce. Liberal justices, however, argued people who don't pay into the health system by purchasing insurance make care more expensive for everyone. ""It is not your free choice"" to stay out of the market for life, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said during arguments. ""I think the justices probably came into the argument with their minds made up. They had hundreds of briefs and months to study them,"" said Thomas Goldstein, publisher of SCOTUSblog.com and a prominent Washington attorney, though he conceded that ""the oral arguments (in March) might have changed their minds around the margin."" Americans are largely split over the reform effort and its legality, according to polling. A March poll for CNN by ORC International found that while support for the law appears to be growing, 50% of Americans opposed the law, 43% supported it and 7% had no opinion. Nearly three-quarters of respondents said they wanted the Supreme Court to overturn at least some of the law's provisions, although the poll did not specify which ones. The law, which helped spur the creation of the conservative tea party movement, is likely to be a centerpiece of the presidential election campaign. Obama's presumptive Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, has promised to repeal the measure if elected. But 76% of respondents in the March CNN/ORC poll said a Supreme Court ruling against the law still wouldn't change their minds about whom to vote for in November. The 2010 passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act came after months of bare-knuckled fights over politics and policy and a century of federal efforts to offer universal health care. The legislation signed by Obama reached 2,700 pages, nine major sections and 450-some provisions. The first lawsuits challenging the health care overhaul began just hours after the president signed the legislation.

"HONG KONG, China (CNN) -- Health authorities in Hong Kong have found more eggs contaminated with the chemical melamine. Chinese consumers were taking the news in stride. ""Stop eating eggs?"" asked one customer. ""That's not doable."" The chemical is at the center of a tainted milk scandal that has sickened more than 50,000 children across China. It's showing up in fresh eggs, according to Hong Kong's Center for Food Safety. Contaminated eggs were found in a batch produced by Jingshan Pengchang Agriculture Product Company, located in Hubei province, about 430 miles (695 km) east of Shanghai, the center said in a statement Tuesday . Although much lower in melamine content than contaminated eggs produced by Hanwei Eggs that were discovered last week in Hong Kong, the Jingshan eggs were still above the legal limit. Tainted eggs from Hanwei had nearly double the maximum permissible level. Health officials in Zhejiang City also found melamine in Ciyunxiang-brand eggs produced by Changzhi City Green Biological Development Center, from Shanxi Province.  Watch how melamine is thought to have entered the food chain » . Melamine is a chemical used in making plastics and fertilizer. But in recent times, it has become the badge of shame for the Chinese food industry. Authorities say people illegally added it to food products to suggest that they contained a higher level of protein.  Learn more about the chemical melamine » . U.N. officials worry that melamine has been introduced to animal feed and that it may turn up in chicken, pork, farmed fish and other products. Health officials in Hong Kong say that there's little risk to human health -- and that a child would have to eat perhaps 20 eggs a day for the melamine to have an effect. But Wal-Mart decided not to take any chances. It pulled Hanwei eggs from the shelves of its supermarkets across China. The egg scare is unlikely to take on the same dimensions as the tainted milk powder scandal, which sickened 54,000 Chinese children and led to the deaths of four babies. Again, melamine was the culprit -- and the consequences could be long-lasting.  Watch more on the local reaction to melamine found in eggs » . Experts say melamine's health risks are not well known. According to Dr. Dan Blumenthal of the Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta, Georgia, ""something we don't know is whether there is a safe amount of melamine in food."" In the meantime, Blumenthal recommends ""the prudent thing to do is to stay away from foods that might be contaminated, and this especially means infant formula and other dairy products that are coming from China."" The Chinese leadership, long criticized by other governments for poor food safety standards, has promised action. A committee of the National People's Congress is reviewing a new draft law. Prime Minister Wen Jiabao said last weekend, ""Food is a continuous process that begins in the fields and ends on your dinner table. From production to transportation to refining to packaging to manufacture, every process needs to go through thorough and strict testing."" The stakes are high for China's food industry and its consumers. Food exports from China were worth $27 billion in 2006, and Chinese food exports to the United States have risen fivefold since 1990. Recent scandals involving melamine have led governments around the world to ban the import of certain Chinese foods; and Beijing wants to restore credibility to the ""Made in China"" label. CNN's Yuli Yang contributed to this story.","Tainted eggs from Hanwei were discovered in Hong Kong late last week .

"(CNN) -- It might be summer, but Bill Cosby has sweaters on his mind. The comedian, best known for playing Dr. Cliff Huxtable in NBC's groundbreaking hit, ""The Cosby Show,"" is asking fans to vote for their favorite eclectic sweater among those he wore. As of Wednesday, an argyle sweater with track runners across the front leads the poll on BillCosby.com. Sweaters compete in categories including ""The Crew, ""The Sweat,"" and ""The Fleecy,"" each one vying to be ""The Champion Stitch."" Voting begins again on July 12. After voting, fans will automatically be entered into a drawing to receive an autographed book by the 75-year-old comedian. Cosby sweaters have become a cultural phenomenon since Cosby first began wearing them in the 1980s. Social media sites, ugly sweater parties, fashion designers and even pop indie artists have celebrated iconic Cosby-sweater look. Several fans said on Twitter of the tournament, ""Easily the best thing I've seen online today."" Cosby sweaters have been the source of controversy, too. In March, Kiley Kmiec, co-founder of the website Cosbysweaters.com, received a cease and desist from Cosby's legal representatives, who alleged the site was a violation of his intellectual property, Gawker reported. The site didn't have anything to do with Cosby's sweaters, it was just a funny name, said Kmiec, who complied and changed the name of the website to nextimpulsesports.com. Representatives for Cosby did not respond to requests for comment. Dutch designer Koos van den Akker, forever linked by his 1980s designs to the Cosby sweater phenomenon, told Fashionista.com that he created the sweaters by simply throwing fabrics together. ""It is all pieces of fabric put together, collaged, totally free-form on a shape that is basically a huge T-shirt, and it was always different,"" he said. ""But he liked it, and it gave him a certain style.""

"AURORA, Colorado (CNN) -- An Afghan native facing terrorism charges planned to bomb a target in New York on the anniversary of the terrorists attacks of September 11, 2001, a federal prosecutor said Friday. Najibullah Zazi gets off an NYPD helicopter in New York on Friday. He was taken to a Brooklyn detention center. Najibullah Zazi intended to be in New York ""with the intent of using"" a bomb on September 11, federal prosecutor Tim Neff said during a court hearing Friday. A federal judge ordered Zazi to remain in custody at the hearing. A few hours later, he left Colorado for New York, where a grand jury indicted him on one count of conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction against unspecified targets in the United States. Bill Muller of the U.S. attorney's office said Zazi's arraignment is scheduled for Tuesday at 11 a.m. Prosecutors said in court that Zazi had been to Pakistan three or four times in the last decade and that he traveled to Canada twice. Investigators said Zazi plotted to make bombs from household chemicals. He made several recent purchases from beauty supply stores in suburban Denver, Colorado, employees said Thursday. Zazi was ""a regular"" at the Beauty Supply Warehouse here, one store worker said.  Exclusive: Denver suspect caught on tape » . Another worker, who identified himself only as Oscar, said Zazi had made several recent purchases and told workers he had ""a lot of girlfriends."" Employees at several beauty supply stores in Aurora told CNN that federal agents visited their stores as part of the investigation, which led to Zazi's arrest Saturday. Some visits by federal agents were as recent as last week, they said. Federal agents visited at least two other stores in recent weeks, workers at those stores told CNN, while a third said it had received phone calls from the FBI. Store workers said agents showed them photographs of several people during one visit, and a worker at one store said he recognized Zazi after seeing pictures of him on television. Video from Beauty Supply Warehouse in Aurora from July 25 and August 28 show a man believed to be Zazi in the store. In the first video, the man is seen at the checkout counter putting a hydrogen peroxide product bottle on the counter, while the rest of the bottles are in his cart. He also purchases hair rollers and pins and a shower cap. The second video shows the same man walking up and down a store aisle until he reaches some hydrogen peroxide product bottles. He puts a dozen of them into his shopping cart. Receipts from the store show that CNN obtained show that the man bought six bottles of peroxide in July, and a dozen in August. The store said it provided the same receipts to the FBI. Beauty Supply Warehouse CEO Karan Hoss tells CNN he also voluntarily provided the two surveillance videos to the FBI. He said they approached his store last week. ""They asked, 'Have you had any customers buying large numbers of hydrogen peroxide?' "" he said. Hoss said his staff examined its records and found they had video surveillance that appeared to correspond to the sales in question. If convicted, the 24-year-old Zazi faces a potential sentence of life in prison. ""We believe any imminent threat arising from this case has been disrupted, but as always, we remind the American public to be vigilant and to report any suspicious activity to law enforcement,"" Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement. Zazi's father, 53-year-old Mohammed Wali Zazi, also from suburban Denver, and Ahmad Wais Afzali, a 37-year-old Muslim cleric and funeral director from the New York borough of Queens, also have been charged with lying to federal agents in the case. Both have been released on bond. According to the indictment, nine pages of notes found on Najibullah Zazi's laptop computer include formulas for making triacetone triperoxide, or TATP. The highly volatile, highly explosive compound can be made from widely available chemicals, including acetone -- the main ingredient in nail polish remover -- hydrogen peroxide, flour and muriatic acid, a diluted form of hydrochloric acid used to clean metal. TATP was used in the 2005 London transit bombings, the 2001 Richard Reid ""shoe bomb"" plot and other overseas attacks. The indictment states Zazi conducted Internet research on components for explosives and made several purchases of substances that can be used to make TATP and other explosives. According to GlobalSecurity.org, an online resource for security information, TATP is extremely sensitive to impact, temperature change and friction. Just a few hundred grams of the material produce hundreds of liters of gas in a fraction of a second, the Web site reports. The government has said in court papers that Zazi has extensive ties to Afghanistan and that his wife and children apparently live in Pakistan. Zazi ""and others"" traveled to Pakistan in August 2008, returning in January 2009. While in Pakistan, he attended courses and received instructions on weapons and explosives at an al Qaeda training facility in one of Pakistan's northwestern tribal districts, federal authorities have said. Zazi moved to the Denver area from New York shortly after returning in January and lived with family members. His father moved to Aurora in July, and they moved in together, the detention motion states. In July and August, Zazi and unidentified others associated with him bought ""unusually large quantities of hydrogen peroxide and acetone products from beauty supply stores"" in the Denver area, investigators say in court documents. Notes found on his computer mention that acetone is found in nail polish remover and hydrogen peroxide can be found in ""Hair Salon 20-30%,"" and the ""bomb-making notes contemplate heating the components in order to make them highly concentrated."" ""The notes discuss formulations for mixing hydrogen peroxide with flour, and list ghee oil as a type of fuel that can be used to help initiate the explosive device,"" the government states. Ghee is clarified butter most often used in Indian cuisine. In the documents, federal agents say Zazi checked into a hotel suite in Aurora that has a stove on August 28, the same day he was seen on surveillance video purchasing 12 large bottles of ""Ms K Liquid 40 Volume,"" a peroxide-based product. He checked back into the same hotel suite on September 6-7. Testing later revealed the presence of acetone residue in the vent above the stove. And Zazi searched the Web site of a home improvement store near the Flushing neighborhood of Queens for muriatic acid on September 8, the documents state. The following day, he started driving from Colorado to New York City in a rental car with his laptop, the memo says. He arrived in Flushing, Queens, on September 10 and apparently became suspicious he was being tracked by law enforcement. He purchased an airline ticket and returned to Denver on September 12, two days before he was scheduled to turn in his car in New York. He spent the night of September 10 at a Queens residence, where federal agents later found his fingerprints on a scale that FBI experts say could be used to weigh the ingredients for explosives. Originally from Afghanistan, Najibullah Zazi and Afzali and are permanent legal residents of the United States. Mohammed Wali Zazi is a naturalized U.S. citizen. Thursday, a federal magistrate in New York ordered Afzali released on bond. His attorney, Ron Kuby, has said his client was trying to help investigators find Najibullah Zazi, whose family had attended his mosque several years ago. Kuby said the imam ""consistently cooperated"" with police in previous investigations and now ""feels ill-used.""

"(CNN) -- Fifteen years ago, a bomb ripped through a federal building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, in the worst homegrown terrorist attack on U.S. soil. The April 19, 1995, attack killed 168 people, shattering the notion that America was largely immune to domestic terrorism. On Monday, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano traveled to to Oklahoma City to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the bombing. She joined survivors, local officials and others at a memorial ceremony, standing in silence for 168 seconds representing the number of dead. In a poignant moment, the names of each of the victims were later read aloud by relatives and colleagues, with speakers referring to their mothers, grandparents and others who died in the bombing. Napolitano told the gathering it was impossible to promise an end to terrorist attacks on American soil. ""Adversaries continue to look for ways to exploit our openness and to take innocent lives,"" she said, promising that her agency would continue to work ""day and night"" to prevent another attack. ""We can resolve even a successful attack will not defeat our way of life,"" Napolitano said, referring to how Oklahoma City responded to the 1995 bombing with community commitment that has become known as the Oklahoma standard. ""We can resolve that the Oklahoma standard becomes the national standard."" Fifteen years later, the bombing's impact still reverberates with those who lived through it. Daniel Gordon, 37, who was about seven miles from the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building at the time of the blast, remembers feeling the force of the explosion as he backed out of a parking spot at a grocery store. ""It felt like I'd hit a car,"" he said of the concussion from the blast. ""I looked and saw a ton of smoke pouring from downtown."" As the day went on, he saw the damage to the building and bodies being pulled from it. ""It was absolutely horrifying,"" said Gordon, a fourth-generation jeweler whose family's presence in Oklahoma predates statehood. ""It was horror in real life."" An Army veteran, Timothy McVeigh, was eventually convicted on federal murder charges in connection with the bombing and executed in 2001. McVeigh said he set off the bomb in front of the Murrah building at 9:01 a.m., in part, to seek revenge against the U.S. government for its raid on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, on April 19, 1993. Of the people killed in the attack, 19 were children who were at a day care center in the facility. Miraculously, six children survived and are now teenagers and young adults. P.J. Allen, now 16, was 18 months old when the bomb brought the building down on top of him, forcing him to inhale hot air and smoke. ""His lungs were severely damaged,"" said Deloris Watson, Allen's grandmother. ""It was touch-and-go for P.J. for a long time."" Now in high school, Allen works with a tutor every week and hopes to study mechanical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He also loves sports, but his damaged lungs keep him from taking part competitively. ""My asthma stops me from running all the time,"" said Allen, who speaks with a hint of a rasp in his voice between quick pauses to catch his breath. ""Sometimes, coaches wouldn't want to play me because I might get hurt."" Despite the hardships and years of surgeries, including numerous tracheotomies, Allen said he hardly ever asks, ""Why me?"" ""Because to me this is normal,"" Allen said. ""As far as I remember, this has been what my life has been like."" Brother and sister Brandon and Rebecca Denny were hurt in the attack, although it was the older brother who received the more permanent injuries. While then-2-year-old Rebecca Denny required 240 stitches to patch her up, her brother -- then 3 -- suffered severe brain injuries, leaving the right side of his body weak. ""First of all, they said he might not live, and second of all, if he does live, he will never walk or talk again,"" said mother Claudia Denny. But Brandon Denny proved doctors wrong. He not only survived, but he is now a junior in high school with his sister. ""When you go through something like this, it just doesn't go away, like the next day or the next year. It affects you for your whole life,"" said Rebecca Gordon, who still wonders why she was lucky enough to survive. ""I wonder,"" she said, ""but I don't know, I guess I have something important to do."" That sense of destiny is shared by another childhood survivor: Chris Nguyen, now a sophomore at the University of Oklahoma in nearby Norman. ""I've been given like a gift, you might say, and if I don't make something of my life to succeed and make a difference of some kind, then I would have wasted my life,"" he said. ""I think about the other parents -- all the other day care children and families -- who've lost someone ... but I feel guilty almost that Brandon, Rebecca, P.J. and I, we get to live our lives ... and the other people, they don't get that opportunity,"" he said. If anything good came out of the bombing, Gordon said, it was that the people of Oklahoma City forged a common bond. ""It was horrible, but so much good came out of it,"" he said. ""This whole city pulled it together. It was phenomenal."" CNN's Don Lemon contributed to this report.","NEW: Homeland security chief joins survivors, local officials, others at memorial ceremony .

They all took a selfie to mark the moment, and never expected that moment would become so momentous. The car bombing targeted and killed Mohamad Chatah, a former Lebanese Ambassador to the United States -- but several others also lost their lives. Minutes after the blast, Chaar appeared in another picture. In it, he's seen lying unconscious and bleeding on the pavement. He would die later from his wounds. As is the custom in Lebanon, hardly any time had passed before Chaar, an innocent bystander, had been branded a far weightier title. All of a sudden, ""victim"" had morphed into ""martyr."" And for many younger Lebanese, so sick of recent violence and rising sectarianism throughout the country, that was just too much. ""I think Mohammad Chaar was the straw that broke the camel's back,"" explained prominent Lebanese blogger Gino Raidy. ""Because what he was doing was taking a selfie, which all of us do every day, and it's in a safe neighborhood, supposedly."" READ MORE: Beirut blast kills 4 in Hezbollah stronghold . Raidy and other outraged Lebanese decided they'd had enough. Seeking not only an end to senseless slaughter, but also justice for Chaar, they began protesting the teenager's death through a unique online campaign called ""Not a Martyr."" When the movement's Facebook page sprang up soon after Chaar died, it contained a message that resonated: . ""We can no longer desensitize ourselves to the constant horror of life in Lebanon,"" read a statement from the group. ""We refuse to become martyrs. We refuse to remain victims. We refuse to die a collateral death."" As a tribute to Chaar and other civilians who died in recent bombings, supporters of the campaign were encouraged to post photos of themselves in which they'd write resolutions they sought for Lebanon and include the hashtag #notamartyr. Dozens have already done so. Among the pictorial messages posted are the following: . The concept of martyrdom is deeply ingrained in Lebanon's war-scarred psychology. But a younger generation is now rejecting the idea that anybody who dies as a result of political- or sectarian-motivated bombings or shootings is automatically a martyr. ""In Lebanon, the word martyr has a lot of gravitas to it,"" Raidy told me. ""When you say martyr, there's no questioning that title. But it got to a point where it sort of became a way to absolve the government of the duty it has to actually investigate and punish the people doing that ... What you see today is people who are saying, no, we don't want to be a martyr. We are victims if we die when we're going to work or to school or doing daily life things."" Blogger Raja Farah agrees. As we stood in Central Beirut's Martyr's Square, he described ""a general sense of helplessness and hopelessness in Lebanon these days."" ""I think, a lot of people feel like we're sitting ducks waiting for our politicians to play some kind of sick game,"" said Farah. ""Martyrdom actually requires a kind of self-sacrifice. You have to be willing to die for something. And a lot of these bystanders that are being killed in these attacks never actually voiced any kind of interest in dying in a certain cause."" While many in Lebanon, a tiny country that survived a brutal 15-year civil war, are accustomed to this kind of violence, there's no doubt a sadness has set in of late. As neighboring Syria burns, sectarian divisions in Lebanon have deepened. Since July, both Shiite and Sunni strongholds across Lebanon have been targeted in a wave of bombings. Dozens have died as a result. READ MORE: Saudi Arabia pledges $3 billion for Lebanese army . A growing number of Lebanese activists and writers don't want to see their country descend into all out chaos. ""I felt like we needed some kind of motivation,"" Farah said. ""I felt like most people have given up and I think I'm pretty to close to giving up as well, and unless something happens, it's hard to still fall in love with this country and have hopes and dreams about it."" Adding to the general unease over the spillover of violence from Syria's civil war, Lebanon's economy is also in tatters. Job options, even for Lebanon's best and brightest, are few and far between -- a sentiment reflected in the selfie Farah posted. ""Mine says I don't want to end up in Dubai,"" explained Farah. ""I mean, sadly, Lebanon is losing all its youth because there are no opportunities here, it's not safe. If you want to start a family you can't really do it here. Job opportunities are very, very limited."" On the ""Not A Martyr"" Facebook page and Twitter feed, you'll see many such complaints. Whether taking on economic woes or bemoaning rampant corruption, the campaign has given voice to a generation seeking to improve life in Lebanon. Lebanese singer Hamed Sinno is among them. ""The campaign is really interesting for me,"" said Sinno, ""because I think it's one of those campaigns that stem out of a political event that actually has reachable goals."" Sinno, lead singer of the extremely popular band Mashrou' Leila, is, like many others, using the platform to advocate change. ""We have people talking about animal rights, about the rights of domestic workers, about small stuff like traffic, like everything else. And then, the bigger stuff as well, like, you know, national security, safety."" Sinno added: ""You have people talking about security, you have people talking about their rights as women, their rights as LGBTQ people."" Sinno, who is openly gay, posted a picture of himself holding a sign in Arabic that read, ""I want to hold my boyfriend's hand without being afraid of the police."" ""My selfie,"" said Sinno, ""was about homophobia with the police and not feeling secure with sort of public displays of affection or public declarations of sexual identity."" According to Sinno, the campaign has also given many Lebanese a much needed space to discuss things they don't like about Lebanon. ""Not that these things are necessarily gonna be resolved when someone posts a selfie,"" said Sinno, ""but it's interesting to sort of see how the bigger political issues in the country actually sediment [sic] into people's daily living experiences."" Sinno and other ""Not A Martyr"" supporters aren't the only ones using creativity to combat complacency. After the bombing that killed Chaar, Lebanese artist Rima Najdi put on a provocative performance by dressing up as a suicide bomber and wandering around Beirut. While the costume was cartoonish and bystanders mostly amused, Najdi told me her display was deadly serious. ""This is me protesting against the normalization of these bombings,"" she said. For Najdi, who lives abroad and visited Lebanon over the holidays, it was an attempt to jolt spectators out a dangerous mindset she fears is setting in. During her stay, two bombs went off -- the one that killed Chaar and another in southern Beirut. ""I was driving in Beirut and on each red light, I was looking for a bomb, actually. And I was waiting for when the bomb is gonna go off,"" explained Najdi. ""And the fact that I looked outside my car's window and (was) looking at the people and noticing that the people are feeling the same, and they might be as well looking for a bomb, that was kind of the key feeling that I felt I need to do a reaction to in a way, so this is how the idea started basically."" Before she set out in disguise, Najdi was quite worried about the reaction she'd receive. While some were scared by her, most were simply amused. Several folks took pictures - others even posed for selfies with her. And while Najdi's happy she never faced any danger, that hasn't diminished her concern for what's happening in Lebanon. ""Feeling that you're gonna die anytime soon just becomes a process that you go through if you're walking in the street,"" said Najdi. ""So this is quite worrying."" But Najdi, like the supporters of ""Not A Martyr"", refuses to give up on Lebanon. For them the point will never be about how to celebrate a death, rather, how to build a life. Journalist Raed Rafei also contributed to this report.","'Not a martyr' campaign is gaining traction in Lebanon .

"(CNN) -- Type in ""French are"" into Google, and one of the top auto-complete items that pops down is ""French are rude."" That exact phrase ""French are rude"" comes back with 93,000 Google results. And France topped out a poll last year of rudest countries to travelers. It's a common stereotype, but it could soon be inaccurate if a new 'charm-school' initiative pays off. Tourists will no longer encounter surly waiters or boorish hotel staff, in Paris at least, if they apply the advice from a new tourist manual about befriending visitors, launched by the Paris tourist board and Paris Chamber of Commerce. doyouspeaktouriste.fr offers tips on how to assist Brits -- they want personalized advice and like to breakfast between 7.30 a.m. and 8.30 a.m. -- and look after Chinese -- they appreciate original luxury shopping suggestions and require nothing more than a smile and a ""ni hao"" to consider you agreeably polite. Other nationalized tips include: . Americans: Expect quick, personalized service; fluency in English . Germans: Enjoy cleanliness and a handshake . Belgians: Prefer budget hotels and Wi-Fi . Brazilians: Like physical contact and taxis . Spanish: Look for free things; eat dinner between 9 p.m. and 11 p.m. French: Enjoy sampling international food; don't want to be considered a ""tourist"" Italians: Eager to explore; welcome attention on their kids . Japanese: Often need to be reassured; never complain; bow frequently . Dutch: Look for free things; enjoy digital information . If it sounds like France is trying to overcome its own national stereotype by spreading others, that's only partly true. ""You don't welcome a Japanese tourist the same way as an Italian one. There are codes to take into account, so you have to adapt,"" Jean-Pierre Blat, general director of the Paris area tourist board, told The Telegraph. France has had its share of bad publicity where tourism is concerned in recent months. In April the Louvre Museum closed after a spate of thefts, and in May a man shot himself in front of horrified tourists in the Notre Dame Cathedral. Officials are passing the new guide to taxi drivers, hotel and restaurant staff and others most frequently in contact with the city's 29 million visitors each year. It's not a new idea. China did something similar before the Beijing Olympics in 2008, informing citizens that spitting, cutting queues and clearing your throat loudly may not be as tolerable to tourists as they are to locals. China has recently taken its politeness initiative outside its own borders too, launching campaigns to teach tourists how to behave while abroad.","New advice manual to be given to taxi drivers, waiters, hotel staff .

"(CNN) -- The future of a reality show that Adam ""DJ AM"" Goldstein was working on for MTV remains undecided after his death Friday night, his publicist said Monday. Adam ""DJ AM"" Goldstein claimed to have 11 years of sobriety after being addicted to crack cocaine. ""It is too soon to have made any decisions at this time regarding the status of the show,"" Jenni Weinman said in an e-mail regarding ""Gone Too Far,"" a show about drug addiction that was set to debut in October. It was a subject close to his heart. The successful deejay and entrepreneur was a self-described crack cocaine addict who had 11 years of sobriety and wanted the show to help others. Since his death, blogs and message boards have been full of speculation over whether the show contributed to his death. Goldstein's body was found in his New York City apartment with a crack pipe nearby and a half bag of crack cocaine and prescription drugs in the home, a police source told People.com. In an interview with MTV this summer, Goldstein, 36, admitted that producing the series presented its share of trials for the recovering addict in him. iReport.com: DJ AM brought rock, rap together . He recalled one moment early in shooting in which he purchased a crack pipe from a local corner store to show how easy they were to procure. ""I realized after I was holding it my palms were sweaty and I was like, wait a minute, this is not smart for me to be holding this and I started really kind of freaking out,"" he said in an interview in July. ""It's been tough, it's like I'm on the borderline of seeing people in their disease that I used to be in. But I have to know why I'm there. There's no better way for me to remember how low my bottom was than to see someone else at their bottom and offer them a chance out of it."" He said that his experiences as a recovering addict inspired him to do the project. Before MTV approached him about the project, Goldstein said outreach to other drug addicts was already a second vocation for him after deejaying. ""Part of me feels like, 'Who am I?' I'm a DJ. This is my one chance. I owe it as a human who's sober to say something to them. So that's my job. That's what I'm there for,"" he said. ""I see myself in every single addict that I've done an episode on ... I see a part of me in them. We completely relate to each on how we started, why we started and the fact we cannot stop on our own."" After he survived a fiery plane crash last year that killed four and left him in need of skin grafts, Goldstein told People.com that he had a nurse dispense pain medication. ""In recovery, they say, 'Take what is exactly prescribed and stop when they say to stop.' I do what I'm told,"" he said. Rapper Jay-Z recalls how even after the crash, Goldstein stood by his commitment to deejay for him at a concert shortly after the tragic event. ""The accident happened and you know I'm thinking OK we'll get up next year, whenever he gets back on his feet. But he called, 'like man, don't count me out for the concert.' I'm like 'what?' And he came and he had a bandage on his head,"" he told CNN. ""It was just a small thing, but his passion and love for what he did that's what is always going to stick with me.""","""It is too soon to have made any decisions,"" publicist says of MTV reality show .

"(CNN) -- A 44-year-old New Orleans man died in front of his two sons Wednesday after he responded to a woman's screams and was shot by an apparent carjacker, according to police and family members. Harry ""Mike"" Ainsworth was with his two sons, ages 9 and 10, as the boys were waiting for a morning school bus, Ainsworth's brother, Bill, told CNN affiliate WWL. The two boys saw their father try to help the female motorist in the Algiers Point neighborhood and, after their father was shot, the boys ran to him and sat with him until emergency responders showed up, Bill Ainsworth said. ""They were there with him when he passed,"" Ainsworth said. ""It's going to be hard on them."" ""Pray the cops find him before I do,"" he said about the carjacker, in an interview with CNN affiliate WDSU. The series of events began when a carjacker approached a woman motorist sitting in her vehicle, knocked on the window and asked for the time, New Orleans police said. As the woman turned to check the time, the carjacker pulled out a handgun and told the woman to get out of the automobile, police said. Ainsworth then jumped on the hood of the vehicle, and the carjacker shot him, left the car and ran, police said. Police released a sketch of the suspect and were offering a $5,000 reward to anonymous tipsters who can help detectives find a black man, in his 20s, between 5-6 and 5-8 in height, and weighing 140 to 150 pounds, detectives said. The woman was unharmed, New Orleans police spokesman Frank Robertson said. ""When you have someone trying to come to the aid of someone who is in need and -- whenever something like this happens, it's a real tragedy,"" police Lt. Gary Marchese told WWL. Skip Gallagher, president of the Algiers Point Neighborhood Association, told WDSU that good Samaritans aren't unusual in the neighborhood. ""I think any other male that had heard that in the neighborhood would have done the same thing,"" Gallagher said. ""They heard some woman screaming, they would have come running. I would have, and every male in this neighborhood would have done the same thing, and we see what happens. ""I'm not sure it's going to change my behavior."" A fund has been established to help the Ainsworth family.","NEW: Harry ""Mike"" Ainsworth jumped on the hood of a car and was shot .

"(CNN) -- President Obama recently gave a speech urging Congress to raise the minimum wage and announced on Wednesday plans to require employers to pay overtime to more salaried employers. The President is certainly doing the right thing for the American public, especially women. A recent poll conducted by Quinnipiac University shows that women are huge fans of raising the national minimum wage. Seventy-six percent of women and 65% of men surveyed support it. Minimum wage is poised to be a driving issue this year. Given how it polls among women, Republicans should seize the chance to enact good policy and good politics with a group of voters they've been alienating. According to a CNN/ORC International Poll, 55% of Americans say the GOP doesn't understand women. That number rises to 59% among all women and 64% among women older than 50. The 2012 election might have been one of the most embarrassing in recent memory for Republicans, who insulted female voters time and again and seemed tone deaf about the challenges that women face. The result is that women ran from the GOP in droves. The bad news for Republicans is that this voting trend won't change overnight, not as the ""party of family values"" continues to reject any ounce of family-friendly policy that might help women and their families grow and thrive. The GOP's policies don't just harken back to the ""Mad Men"" era; Fred Flintstone could be their architect. They don't really consider women as the powerful economic agents they are. In large numbers, both House and Senate Republicans voted against restoring the rights of women to challenge fair pay practices when they were curtailed by the Supreme Court. Republicans also blocked the Paycheck Fairness Act, which would provide more effective remedies to women who are not being paid equal wages for doing equal work. Equal pay would not only help the families who depend on female breadwinners, but it would also be a boon for the overall economy by adding $447.6 billion to the GDP. Failing to raise the minimum wage might be a boondoggle for the current set of Republican lawmakers, in that almost two-thirds of minimum wage earners are women, and women care about this issue deeply. There should be a lot for conservatives to like in raising the minimum wage. Raising the wage to $10.10 would save $46 billion from the federal coffers in food assistance, an area where Republicans have said they want to find significant savings. That is real savings for those who claim to care about deficits: $4.6 billion in the first year alone. Republicans would be smart to leave behind minimum wage deniers like Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Rep. Joe Barton of Texas, who have expressed the view that they don't even think we need a minimum wage. These views are out of the mainstream of the American public and threaten to return the American workforce to the dark ages of employee abuse and mistreatment. The women who earn the minimum wage are not teenagers working the counter at McDonalds; they are caregivers, child care workers and retail workers. Nearly 80% of women who earned at or below the minimum wage in 2012 were 20 years old or older, and just less than 40% were 30 years old or older. Oftentimes, these are women who are the breadwinners or co-breadwinners for their entire families, so adding to their wages could potentially give them additional buying power, which can help lift the economy overall. Instead of agreeing to a media friendly set of promises to try harder to court female candidates, and finding the right female elected members to be the outward face of the party, women want Republicans to dig a little deeper to find the real solutions that would make their lives better. This isn't about using the right buzzwords to not insult women, their bodies, or their place in the family. What would really matter is if Republicans advocated for women where it counts: as breadwinners and drivers of our economic growth. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andrea Purse.","President Obama recently urged Congress to raise the national minimum wage .

"(CNN) -- Like a 3-year-old who thinks he's just discovered the wheel, billionaire Michael Bloomberg is reveling over his startling new gun control tool: the grass roots. This is where it hurts to be the neophyte on the block. Bloomberg: We will fight the NRA with common sense . In the 1980s, when ""handgun control"" was at its prime, its objective was to compete with the Second Amendment movement in organizing the grass roots. When ""handgun control"" become politically incorrect, the reformulated Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence pronounced that its objective was to match pro-gunner's formidable grass-roots efforts with its own. In fact, efforts in 2013 to pass Obama's gun control policies were fueled by perhaps the biggest ""grass-roots"" organization that the ""left"" has mustered: Obama's ""Organizing for America."" Yet, this effort, too, fell short. It's not for lack of trying that gun control has failed. Nor is it for lack of arrogance. In fact, Bloomberg, who just announced that he will drop $50 million on so-called ""gun safety"" efforts, showed the arrogance of a dilettante breezing into a New York restaurant by proclaiming he doesn't need God's permission to enter heaven. Said Bloomberg: ""If there is a God, when I get to heaven, I'm not stopping to be interviewed. I am heading straight in. I have earned my place in heaven. It's not even close."" (Beware anyone who thought they would be enjoying ""Big Gulps"" in the afterlife.) But Bloomberg's ""arrogance of wealth"" may be precisely his downfall. Gun owners are smarter than Bloomberg. In 2013, after the Newtown incident, our members were more than capable of reading Bloomberg's duplicitous background check legislation and understanding what it actually did: open a back door to gun registration. Gun owners also watched, incredulously, when Bloomberg's minions cheered New York and Connecticut's massive gun bans and gun registration requirements -- only to deny, in Washington, that they supported either of these things. Furthermore, gun owners understand that they have everything on the line. They understand that, in places such as New York City, the government has been sending letters demanding the confiscation of guns in violation of a 2010 city ordinance. And they understand that, for them, this is more than a ""billionaire hobby"" like a yacht or private plane. Gun owners are not hypocrites. They resent it when Bloomberg insists on his 17-man armed security detail for himself while denying them the right to protect themselves or their families. So my message to Bloomberg is this: Spend it all. Spend all of it. Bloomberg's hatred and hypocrisy has only energized our people, who have enacted 70 pro-gun state laws since Newtown -- twice the number of Bloomberg anti-gun laws that have been enacted around the country. Let billionaire Bloomberg sweep into Alaska and Arkansas and pretend he can buy the people in those states. He will only energize other gun groups who will be forced to oppose red state Democrats. And the prospects of a sweeping Republican victory will be even greater.

"(CNN) -- Manchester United's sorry defense of the English Premier League title continued Sunday as they were held to a 2-2 draw at Old Trafford by bottom club Fulham. Darren Bent grabbed an injury time equalizer for the visitors, who had led for much of the match through Steve Sidwell's first half strike in the 19th minute. Rene Meulensteen's men bravely held on until the 78th minute when Robin van Persie equalized. Two minutes later Michael Carrick looked to have sealed three points but it was his mistake which gave Bent the opportunity to head home in the fourth minute of added time. The dropped points heap further pressure on under fire manager David Moyes with his team nine points adrift on arch-rivals Liverpool, who are occupying the fourth and final Champions League spot. He was left frustrated after careless errors and poor finishing allowed Fulham to claim a point. ""Today was as bad as it gets,"" he told BBC Sport. ""We dominated the game and how we did not win it I do not know. ""We made a couple of defensive lapses and it costs us,"" he added. Fulham, who were avoiding defeat for only the fourth time in 17 games, showed redoubtable spirit and after Sidwell had converted on-loan Lewis Holtby fine pass, Kieran Richardson, a former United player, missed a great chance to put the visitors 2-0 ahead. With United dominating possession, Van Persie leveled from new signing Juan Mata's pass. Carrick's shot then deflected past the excellent visiting goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg until the late drama to stun the home faithful. Earlier, Tottenham Hotspur moved up to fifth -- leapfrogging Sunday's opponents Everton -- with a 1-0 home win at White Hart Lane. Everton had the better of the first half and home goalkeeper Hugo Lloris made crucial saves, but after the break Spurs offered more threat, with Emmanuel Adebayor grabbing the only goal of the match. He was alert after Kyle Walker's quick free quick and blasted a fine shot past Tim Howard in the 65th minute. The victory left Tim Sherwood's team three points adrift of Liverpool, who thrashed Arsenal 5-1 at Anfield Saturday to underline their credentials.","Manchester Utd held 2-2 at Old Trafford by Fulham .

"(CNN) -- Disney and Universal will soon have competition on the film-inspired theme park front. Twentieth Century Fox has just unveiled plans to join the thrill ride party. Named ""Twentieth Century Fox World,"" the brand's first theme park is set to open 2016 as part of Malaysia's Resorts World Genting, a leisure and entertainment complex about an hour outside of Kuala Lumpur. According to the plans, the 25-acre park will feature more than 25 rides and attractions based on Fox films such as ""Ice Age,"" ""Rio,"" ""Alien vs. Predator,"" ""Planet of the Apes"" and ""Night at the Museum."" Some will be geared towards kids, others for thrill seekers. We can't confirm our suspicions, but it's likely the ""Alien vs. Predator"" ride will not be ideal for three-year-olds. ""The opening of the first Twentieth Century Fox theme park at Resorts World Genting takes our rich history of storytelling to a whole new level and will provide an exceptional entertainment experience,"" said Jeffrey Godsick, president of Twentieth Century Fox Consumer Products, in a statement. ""People from around the world will gather here in Malaysia to become part of the story and to experience the magic and adventure of their favorite Fox properties."" Twentieth Century Fox has teamed up with with leisure and hospitality corporation Genting Malaysia to build the park. Genting Malaysia CEO Tan Sri Lim Kok Thay said they're investing $300 million in Twentieth Century Fox World and expect most visitors to come from Malaysia with international arrivals coming mainly from China and Southeast Asia.

At this stage of her life, 5-month-old Bao Bao's hobbies are mainly eating bamboo and lounging. She is cautious like her mother and pretty laid back, CNN affiliate WJLA reported, citing a zoo official. Bao Bao (pronounced bow-BOW) inspired lengthy lines, but visitors like Becky Moyer and her family said the three-hour drive worth it. ""We frequent Philly's zoo.

"(CNN) -- Ivory Coast striker Didier Drogba has rejoined his teammates at their training base in Switzerland after successful surgery on his broken arm. It had been feared Drogba would miss the World Cup after he picked up the injury during a collision with defender Marcus Tulio Tanaka in a friendly against Japan on Friday. The Chelsea forward was immediately taken for surgery, which was a success, according to a spokesman for the Côte d'Ivoire Football Federation, but it remains to be seen how big a part he will play in the tournament. ""His recovery has been extremely encouraging,"" spokesman Roger Kouassi was quoted as saying by the UK Press Association. ""It is suggested that, at this stage, all the signs are good and there is great hope the captain of the Elephants will be in action with his teammates as soon as possible."" Drogba is seen as vital to coach Sven Goran Eriksson's plans, especially as Ivory Coast have been drawn in the so-called group of death alongside Brazil, Portugal and North Korea. The 32-year-old scored 37 goals for Chelsea last season and is the current African player of the year.

"(CNN) -- Child beauty pageants are a lot like crime coverage on local news. Stick with me. This will make sense. I promise. Viewers complain there's too much crime in local television news reports, and yet, the stations covering crime enjoy high ratings. People complain that child beauty pageants exploit young girls -- some as young as 3 or 4 who are donning makeup, high heels and fake tans -- and yet, the ratings for reality television shows such as TLC's ""Toddlers & Tiaras"" are sky high. We don't like the idea of these beauty contests for kids, but it seems we can't pull ourselves away. But what if there were no pageants for kids to begin with? If French lawmakers get their way, there would be no French version of ""Toddlers & Tiaras"" and no French ""Honey Boo Boo,"" referring to another child pageant reality star. The Senate in France voted to ban child beauty pageants for kids under the age of 16 and now the measure goes to the country's lower house for debate and a vote. Where did this anti-pageant momentum come from on the part of the French? Some lawmakers point to a controversial photo spread in Vogue back in 2010, featuring a girl as young as 10 in high heels and sexy makeup. Toddler does Dolly: Where's the line between dress-up, hyper-sexualization? The pageants are sexualizing our young girls, said lawmakers in France, and judging by the response to our request for comment on CNN's Facebook page, many people in the United States agree. ""How pleased I am that, finally, some are fully awakened and realizing that child beauty pageants should be banned,"" said Darlene Eckerman of Amarillo, Texas, in an e-mail message. ""The mothers are the culprits here: teaching your child to be sexy and alluring at such a young, tender age when they are not ready for such exploitation."" Samantha Biswas, also via e-mail, said, ""It is not about living vicariously through your child. It's about letting your child's childhood and youth get stolen by makeup, fashion shows, heels and dresses."" ""To paint makeup on their faces and do up their hair, etc., OMG, wake up people,"" said Charlie Caissie. ""These are children for heaven's sake, not adults. Let them decide for themselves at an appropriate age if they want to pursue this when they are adults."" Psychologist Wendy Walsh said the danger here is normalizing behavior that once would have been considered extreme and weird. ""And now it seems perfectly OK for a little 6-year-old to be walking around in thigh-high boots and short booty shorts and smacking her butt when she dances down a runway? Come on! That's what a stripper does."" Others expressed fears about who may be watching these pageants. ""Every time I think about child beauty pageants, my heart sinks at the thought of all the pedophiles watching them. Why in the world do children need to be so sexualized?"" asked a CNN reader. Opinion: 'Toddlers and Tiaras' and sexualizing 3-year-olds . On the other side are moms like Anna Berry of Littleton, Colorado, who said her 13-year-old daughter Ashley was so shy she couldn't even order for herself at a restaurant. After she started appearing in ""natural"" pageants (no makeup allowed), she blossomed. And now, as ""Miss Heartland Junior Teen,"" she speaks to young girls across the country about her experiences with bullying, something she encountered when girls were jealous of her success on the pageant circuit. ""She's a role model to many and her confidence to stand up and speak out came from her improved self-esteem through pageantry,"" said Berry, who says Ashley can out interview and speak more confidently than most adults.""These are skills that will benefit her for a lifetime ... just as they did for me growing up in pageantry."" Valerie Best, director of The BEST Shining Stars Pageant located in Southern Indiana, is also strongly against banning pageants for young girls and boys. She said just because some pageant systems ""push it too far"" (hers, she said, does not allow ""fake hair, fake tans, fake teeth or a lot of makeup""), they most definitely should not be outlawed. ""Society is too quick to judge something they are not familiar with,"" said Best. "" A pageant (run) properly is no different than a young girl competing in gymnastics, a school function or anything else that has a score kept or judged upon. Teach these girls to be strong, confident individuals and see how far they go in life.""' Six-year-old American beauty queen draws protests and $77,000 payday . Wynn Westmoreland of Atlanta appeared in school pageants beginning in the sixth grade and competed in the University of Georgia pageant, which is part of the Miss America program. She does not believe in a legal ban. ""It's not a government issue,"" said Westmoreland. ""It's a social issue and it's a family issue."" She believes the pageant bodies should get together and create a new rule only allowing girls to enter when they are at an age when they can choose what they want to do for themselves, around 9, 10 or 11. Countdown for Kendall Jenner turning 18: Gross or fair game? ""I do not like it when children who are not able to make choices on their own are forced to be in pageants and that is when I see the over-glamourization of young girls,"" said Westmoreland, who is a media coordinator and writer for CNN's food blog, Eatocracy. ""They don't even look like children anymore. They look like objects."" Tish Howard, a former school principal, is no fan of child pageants, but like Westmoreland, thinks government should not be deciding what programs are acceptable for children. ""I think outlawing them is a slippery slope where the government starts dictating what activities parents can or cannot make available to children,"" said Howard. ""I do believe we could set guidelines on what does and does not constitute promoting sexual exploitation of children as far as routines and dress."" I always try to approach these stories, as a mom of two young girls, with the question of what would I do? In this case, how would I feel if my girls wanted to enter a pageant?

Full disclosure here: I did compete in the New York Miss T.E.E.N. pageant in high school, but let me stress it was not a beauty pageant but a pageant based on talent, interviewing skills and community service. It was a terrific experience for me, and as many other women said earlier, it only added to my self-esteem, confidence and fire to achieve my dreams. So back to the question, what if my girls, ages 5 and 7, wanted to be in a pageant? I think I agree with the sentiment that they can do what they want when they are old enough to make that decision for themselves, which means I don't have to worry about this one. At least not yet.

"(CNN) -- In the past week, U.S. officials have announced charges in five terrorism probes in five states. It is a confluence of cases unlike anything the country has seen since the September 11, 2001, attacks. Najibullah Zazi, 24, has been indicted on a charge of conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction in the U.S. But CNN's national security analyst Peter Bergen and law enforcement analyst Mike Brooks say not to read too much into it -- the rush of arrests is a coincidence. ""These are things that are happening completely independently,"" Bergen said. Brooks agreed, calling it a ""happenstance."" Last weekend, authorities arrested three suspects -- two in Colorado and one in New York -- for allegedly lying to the FBI in a terrorism probe. One of the three is now also accused of plotting to make a powerful bomb. A federal judge on Friday ordered Afghan native Najibullah Zazi, 24, of Colorado to remain in custody. Zazi is charged with plotting to set off ""weapons of mass destruction"" in the United States. Investigators say Zazi plotted to make bombs from household chemicals. He made several recent purchases from beauty supply stores in suburban Denver, telling workers he had ""a lot of girlfriends,"" employees said Thursday.  Watch how Zazi was caught on tape » . Zazi's father, Mohammed Wali Zazi, 53, also from suburban Denver, and Ahmad Wais Afzali, 37, a Muslim cleric and funeral director from the New York borough of Queens, also have been charged with lying to federal agents in the case. Both have been released on bond. On Thursday, officials announced an indictment against a resident of the New York City borough of Brooklyn for conspiracy to commit murder abroad and for support of foreign terrorists. Betim Kaziu, 21, was indicted for conspiracy to commit murder abroad and support foreign terrorists. The U.S. attorney's office said he wanted to join the militant group Al-Shabaab in Somali and to ""take up arms against perceived enemies of Islam."" In Texas, a 19-year-old Jordanian was arrested this week on suspicion of plotting to bomb a Dallas skyscraper. Federal officials said Hosam Maher Husein Smadi, who entered the United States illegally and lived in Texas, tried to set off an explosive attached to a vehicle at the base of the 60-story Fountain Place office tower. Meanwhile in Springfield, Illinois, an alleged would-be terrorist was arrested on charges of trying to detonate a truck bomb to blow up a federal building. Justice Department officials said Michael Finton, also known as Talib Islam, 29, of Decatur, Illinois, drove a vehicle he believed contained a ton of explosives to the Paul Findley Federal Building and Courthouse in Springfield. He got out of the truck, got into a waiting car with an undercover agent, and then, when he was a few blocks away, attempted to detonate the bomb with a remote-control device. And in North Carolina, three new charges were announced against a man who allegedly planned to attack the U.S. Marine base at Quantico, Virginia. Danield Patrick Boyd and seven others already had been charged with conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists and conspiracy to murder, kidnap, maim and injure people. They allegedly planned to attack the U.S. Marine base at Quantico, Virginia. At any given time, FBI agents ""are proactively looking at a lot of different things. And there are ongoing cases right now,"" Brooks said. There was one element of the developments of the past week that was coordinated, Bergen and Brooks noted -- the timing with which authorities released information about the cases in Illinois and Texas. Given the similarities between the two cases, authorities feared word of the Illinois arrest could tip off the Texas would-be bomber of an undercover sting operation, according to a federal law enforcement official familiar with the cases. So authorities withheld word of the Illinois arrest until the Texas sting operation was completed. Do these various incidents suggest a spike in homegrown terrorism? ""I think it's really too soon to tell,"" said Clark Kent Ervin, a CNN security analyst and former inspector general of the Office of Homeland Security. It appears that the case involving suspects in New York and Denver and the Dallas case may have been planned for the anniversary of the September 11 attacks, Ervin said. ""It just underscores that we remain under potential attack here."" It also shows that ""every city in the United States, no matter how big or prominent, can be a potential terror target,"" he added. An attack in a place not generally thought of as a terrorist target ""would arguably have a bigger psychological effect,"" he said. While the five probes do not appear linked, they do involve suspects of a similar ""socio-economic profile,"" said Bergen. ""The profiles of the people... generally speaking is much closer to what we see among European Muslims,"" he said. ""They tend to be less well integrated"" into mainstream society, and in many cases have faced economic difficulties and unemployment, Bergen said. If there is a link among the suspects, Bergen said, ""it's a feeling of exclusion from the American dream.""","Five terrorism cases in five states not connected, CNN analysts say .

"(CNN) -- At a security conference recently, the moderator asked the panel of distinguished cybersecurity leaders what their nightmare scenario was. The answers were the predictable array of large-scale attacks: against our communications infrastructure, against the power grid, against the financial system, in combination with a physical attack. I didn't get to give my answer until the afternoon, which was: ""My nightmare scenario is that people keep talking about their nightmare scenarios."" There's a certain blindness that comes from worst-case thinking. An extension of the precautionary principle, it involves imagining the worst possible outcome and then acting as if it were a certainty. It substitutes imagination for thinking, speculation for risk analysis and fear for reason. It fosters powerlessness and vulnerability and magnifies social paralysis. And it makes us more vulnerable to the effects of terrorism. Worst-case thinking means generally bad decision making for several reasons. First, it's only half of the cost-benefit equation. Every decision has costs and benefits, risks and rewards. By speculating about what can possibly go wrong, and then acting as if that is likely to happen, worst-case thinking focuses only on the extreme but improbable risks and does a poor job at assessing outcomes. Second, it's based on flawed logic. It begs the question by assuming that a proponent of an action must prove that the nightmare scenario is impossible. Third, it can be used to support any position or its opposite. If we build a nuclear power plant, it could melt down. If we don't build it, we will run short of power and society will collapse into anarchy. If we allow flights near Iceland's volcanic ash, planes will crash and people will die. If we don't, organs won't arrive in time for transplant operations and people will die. If we don't invade Iraq, Saddam Hussein might use the nuclear weapons he might have. If we do, we might destabilize the Middle East, leading to widespread violence and death. Of course, not all fears are equal. Those that we tend to exaggerate are more easily justified by worst-case thinking. So terrorism fears trump privacy fears, and almost everything else; technology is hard to understand and therefore scary; nuclear weapons are worse than conventional weapons; our children need to be protected at all costs; and annihilating the planet is bad. Basically, any fear that would make a good movie plot is amenable to worst-case thinking. Fourth and finally, worst-case thinking validates ignorance. Instead of focusing on what we know, it focuses on what we don't know -- and what we can imagine. Remember Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's quote? ""Reports that say that something hasn't happened are always interesting to me, because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns -- the ones we don't know we don't know."" And this: ""the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence."" Ignorance isn't a cause for doubt; when you can fill that ignorance with imagination, it can be a call to action. Even worse, it can lead to hasty and dangerous acts. You can't wait for a smoking gun, so you act as if the gun is about to go off. Rather than making us safer, worst-case thinking has the potential to cause dangerous escalation. The new undercurrent in this is that our society no longer has the ability to calculate probabilities. Risk assessment is devalued. Probabilistic thinking is repudiated in favor of ""possibilistic thinking"": Since we can't know what's likely to go wrong, let's speculate about what can possibly go wrong. Worst-case thinking leads to bad decisions, bad systems design, and bad security. And we all have direct experience with its effects: airline security and the TSA, which we make fun of when we're not appalled that they're harassing 93-year-old women or keeping first-graders off airplanes. You can't be too careful! Actually, you can. You can refuse to fly because of the possibility of plane crashes. You can lock your children in the house because of the possibility of child predators. You can eschew all contact with people because of the possibility of hurt. Steven Hawking wants to avoid trying to communicate with aliens because they might be hostile; does he want to turn off all the planet's television broadcasts because they're radiating into space? It isn't hard to parody worst-case thinking, and at its extreme it's a psychological condition. Frank Furedi, a sociology professor at the University of Kent, writes: ""Worst-case thinking encourages society to adopt fear as one of the dominant principles around which the public, the government and institutions should organize their life. It institutionalizes insecurity and fosters a mood of confusion and powerlessness. Through popularizing the belief that worst cases are normal, it incites people to feel defenseless and vulnerable to a wide range of future threats."" Even worse, it plays directly into the hands of terrorists, creating a population that is easily terrorized -- even by failed terrorist attacks like the Christmas Day underwear bomber and the Times Square SUV bomber. When someone is proposing a change, the onus should be on them to justify it over the status quo. But worst case thinking is a way of looking at the world that exaggerates the rare and unusual and gives the rare much more credence than it deserves. It isn't really a principle; it's a cheap trick to justify what you already believe. It lets lazy or biased people make what seem to be cogent arguments without understanding the whole issue. And when people don't need to refute counterarguments, there's no point in listening to them. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bruce Schneier.","Bruce Schneier says worst-case security planning focuses on unlikely as though it's certain .
He says it's a blunt intrument that distorts risk analysis, plays to terrorists, makes us fearful .
This, he says, leads to bad, dangerous decisions and policies that leave us vulnerable .

"(CNN) -- Stepping on stage after leading her party to its biggest electoral triumph in decades, German Chancellor Angela Merkel almost seemed the antithesis of a modern-day politician. Bouquet in hand and beaming broadly as the adoring crowd chanted ""Angie, Angie,"" the 59 year-old looked more flattered than full of herself. ""This is a super result,"" she said. ""I think we can all be proud."" It wasn't the royal ""we"" Merkel was referring to -- a mistake former British Prime Minister and so-called ""Iron Lady"" Margaret Thatcher once cringingly made -- but rather some 41.5% of German voters. So much for those who say plainness precludes power. Set to become only the third post-war chancellor to win as many terms in office, Merkel's speech was a modest affair compared with those of other three-term titans like former British PM Tony Blair. For Merkel there was no vainglorious fist-thumping. No pie-in-the sky promises to move heaven and earth, to mend the economy and conquer child poverty. READ MORE: Merkel's recipe for success . Instead, she thanked her husband and supporters and alluded to the challenges of forming a working coalition in the days to come. This is ""Merkiavellism"" at its best: Understated but achieving. And it's a strategy that is refreshing to watch. After all, it's not often that voters favor consistency over charisma, especially during times of economic strain. Merkel's anti-ego approach has made her an unlikely icon of our times. Comparisons with the ""Iron Lady"" are easy to make for a woman who regularly tops Time magazine's list of the world's most influential people and -- as the leader of Europe's richest nation -- holds huge sway over its finances. But Merkel's modus operandi is different. READ MORE: Five things to know about Merkel's leadership and Europe . She may not care enough, some say, for consensus and compromise. Despite that, one has the feeling her choices are born from personal conviction rather than point scoring. A pastor's daughter from the country's former Eastern bloc, Merkel comes over as a moralist in the tawdry world of international government and its gargantuan egos -- perhaps unnervingly so. She's like the good student tucked away in the corner, who puts others to shame come exam time. Such studied benevolence has served the chancellor well at home, where, despite being childless, she is revered for her soft, caring image, and fondly called ""Mutti'' or ""Mummy"" by millions. Then again, the relationship between mother and child can be one of love and hate, meaning for Frau Merkel there's no room for basking in glory, or for complacency. Targets must be struck. READ MORE: Will Merkel practice what she preaches? Relationships between Germany and its world partners can be just as fickle. And since politics is a world of smoke and mirrors, of illusions and delusions of grandeur, it would be naive to assume Merkel wasn't as much of a political animal as her peers. She has made mistakes and has been loath to admit she's wrong. But the upside of Merkel's subtle strategy is her errors are harder to spot in a government ruling under the radar. As elected chancellor of one nation in Europe she has extended her mandate way beyond its borders, dictating humiliating terms to Germany's bailed out neighbors and shying away from big foreign policy asks on Mali and Syria. Two terms of Merkel in charge may have shielded her country from the worst of the eurozone crisis. But with a widening gap between rich and poor ""Angie"" has her work cut out to rebalance her country's economy and raise low wages. Finding a way to keep Germany's factories running in the future without cheap nuclear energy is another question Merkel will eventually have to answer. Merkel's second term left her nation strong but Europe more divided than ever. Her third term will require her to focus on reforms at home not abroad, much to the relief of the rest of the region. But, again, expect Germany's first and favorite female leader to go about that quietly. Regardless of whether you espouse her policies, Merkel's victory over the weekend isn't just a win for her -- it's also a victory for substance over style.","German Chancellor Angela Merkel, heading into her third term, is the antithesis of a modern-day politician .

"(CNN) -- A protester in military fatigues and an old steel army helmet barks out orders to a line of Ukrainian police officers -- yes, police officers. ""Forward, march!"" shouts the protester. And the officers move, to the delight of cheering protesters. ""Good work! Good work!"" the crowd screams as the officers move toward Kiev's Independence Square. The officers -- about 30 in number -- are defectors mostly from the town of Lviv in western Ukraine, where most look toward Europe in a divided nation that has long split allegiance between Europe and Russia. Their commander, Vassily Krikowsky, decided to lead them to Kiev after seeing the images of bloodied protesters, some killed -- opposition officials say -- at the hands of security forces. ""We want to make a statement that we cannot tolerate this any longer,"" he said. ""We are from western Ukraine, and we want to show everyone that the police is with the people."" The question of whether some police officers were defecting amid the violence took center stage on Thursday, when the government said protesters had taken several dozen police officers hostage. However, other officers appeared on Ukrainian television saying they had defected after receiving orders to use force on protesters. It's unclear what might happen to the men. An agreement signed Friday by government and opposition leaders requires protesters and security forces alike to withdraw from the streets and turn in illegal weapons. It appears to protect protesters from prosecution for illegal weapons possession during the protest. But it doesn't address the case of police officers who walked away from their jobs to join and help defend protesters against their comrades. Although things are peaceful today, the men are well aware that they might have to confront their colleagues on the other side of the barricades if the situation escalates again. ""Some police officers have committed crimes,"" Krikowsky said. ""By shooting at unarmed people and medical volunteers. Those are crimes.""","Police commander leads his officers from western Ukraine to Kiev .

"(CNN) -- Facebook's decision to allow the uploading and sharing of extreme/graphic content -- including beheadings -- makes no sense in a conventional media setting. Most western media outlets operate under regulatory codes that make the screening or publishing of such material unthinkable -- not least because their audience might include children. Inevitably the ""protection of children"" argument will be rehearsed in response to Facebook's decision, which seems almost designed to court negative commentary. Read more: Facebook lifts ban on beheading videos . The decision will also naturally re-open the usual -- somewhat tired -- debates about the (im)possibility of regulating internet content. Internet content is of course regulated and controlled but not very effectively so. The decision may also offer the genuinely weird and definitively 21st century prospect of UK and U.S. security services using Facebook to track global viewing patterns of beheading videos. Read more: NSA mines Facebook for connections . More seriously perhaps, we all need to question what it means that so pivotal a social media platform is re-defining social precedents and norms -- with little external reference. What should Facebook users take from the site's decision that it is OK to screen and view the brutal beheading of a woman in Mexico -- provided that the commentary clearly doesn't glorify the act and that any unsuitable comments are moderated/blocked? Is it only that brutal violence is part of life and we have the right to make the obvious comments about that fact. As Facebook's statement says: . ""Facebook has long been a place where people turn to share their experiences, particularly when they're connected to controversial events on the ground, such as human rights abuses, acts of terrorism and other violent events. ""People share videos of these events on Facebook to condemn them. If they were being celebrated, or the actions in them encouraged, our approach would be different."" Apart from an increased volume of utterly banal denunciations of the act (only the ""right"" kinds of statements will be allowed) what could the screening of such events lead to? People who feel that violence is wrong will say so, people who make risquÃ© or bad-taste jokes will make them, and so the chatter will go on. In 2003, the U.S. military clamped-down on active service personnel's trading of explicit smart-phone images of the aftermath of suicide bombings in Iraq. So, the potential cultural power of such images can be recognised by liberals, conservatives, and bodies such as the Family Online Safety Institute alike -- even if they fundamentally disagree about what that power is. Equally, it's not safe to accept the treatment of such footage as a set of taboo ""magic objects,"" which can never be seen because they are inherently so dangerous in their ability to corrupt the majority and the minors. Such anxieties are frequently directed at unspecified (ie: less educated than ""us"" -- less middle-class) mass audiences and are another means of closing down challenge or debate. What is at stake here does seem to be a realignment of sadly well-known patterns. These are simply thrown into sharp relief by the specifics of the examples that are being spoken about today. Facebook kills search privacy setting . 'Laughably inconsistent' Facebook sees it as a legitimate service to allow its audience to see a woman being brutally killed and then host discussion of that content, but will not allow its users to see exposed breasts -- for fear of causing offense. Is it possible for Facebook to argue that there is nothing to debate in the representation of women's bodies? Or that they are not part of people's experience? This is -- at best -- laughably inconsistent. One of the primary reasons for carrying out beheadings in public or for perpetrators to video a violent act is to send the clear message to its audience: this is what our ""law"" or ""power"", or violence can do to you. So, the re-showing of such footage on Facebook is actively collusive with those actions. It disseminates the fear and intimidation intended in the act. Asserting that Facebook users can respond to footage of a woman's brutal murder by decrying it, sidesteps that issue. Users could just as well decry violence against women without seeing this act. But fewer of them may do so. If Facebook really was interested in public debate, it would have established a real and carefully constructed, open forum in which this decision could be debated -- as well as other issues about its policies, operation and inconsistent stances. What Facebook is interested in, is generating more traffic through its platform and it is doing so from within a pretty inconsistent, narrowly male and conservative image of the world and of what should be discussed within it. How different is that from many traditional media organizations of the 19th and 20th centuries? Read more: Twitter cracks down on abusive tweets .

But the expanded field -- from 16 to 24 -- means there could be a few debutants in France in two years. Sunday's qualifying draw didn't produce a group of death, and the likes of two-time reigning champions Spain, the consistent Germans and always dangerous Italy shouldn't be sweating it out come the end of qualifying. Spain landed in a group with Ukraine, Luxembourg, Belarus, Macedonia and Slovakia -- and of the latter quintet, only Ukraine features in the top 50 in the FIFA world rankings. Instead of simply the group winner and best second-place finisher automatically qualifying, now the top two in the nine groups and best third-place finisher will automatically progress. The playoffs decide the final four places. Gibraltar, population 30,000 and about to embark on its first qualifying campaign, drew the mighty Germans along with Ireland, Poland, Scotland and Georgia. England was paired with, among others, Switzerland -- the nation England boss Roy Hodgson used to guide. As host, France is guaranteed a berth in the tournament but will be placed in a group where it will essentially play friendlies. In this case, Les Bleus can look forward to facing Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal. ""Now we know the 10 games we have to play,"" France coach Didier Deschamps was quoted as saying by UEFA. ""It's pretty good to play a team like Portugal, as they will be prestigious matches."" UEFA president Michel Platini said Germany and England were two of the three member associations who opposed increasing the Euro 2016 field but the Frenchman wasn't fussed. He didn't name the other member association against the move. ""In any democracy, when the vast majority are in favor, you go forward with it even if England or Germany aren't for it,"" he told reporters this week. ""The five or six biggest teams don't have much to worry about, but for the others it will be very competitive. ""So 24 teams will be as good as 16 teams."" In another change, teams contesting two matches in one qualifying round will either play on a Thursday and Sunday, Friday and Monday or Saturday and Tuesday as part of UEFA's ""week of football"" initiative. Currently, international matches are mostly played on Fridays and Tuesdays. ""It was a political decision,"" Platini, a former European footballer of the year, said. ""We took it to try and promote the football of national teams. ""Clubs play on almost every day of the week and as a result, international football has been pushed out of the limelight and we would like to see it take that limelight again."" Qualifying starts in September, two months after the World Cup in Brazil concludes. Full draw: . Group A: Netherlands, Czech Republic Turkey, Latvia, Iceland, Kazakhstan . Group B: Bosnia-Herzegovina, Belgium, Israel, Wales, Cyprus, Andorra . Group C: Spain, Ukraine, Slovakia, Belarus, FYR Macedonia, Luxembourg . Group D: Germany, Ireland, Poland, Scotland, Georgia, Gibraltar . Group E: England, Switzerland, Slovenia, Estonia, San Marino, Lithuania .

"(CNN) -- The remains found last week on the bank of an Illinois river and near a blue barrel are not those of Stacy Peterson, Illinois state police said Wednesday. Partial skeletal remains were found on the south bank of the Des Plaines River near Channahon, Illinois. Many people speculated that the remains, found near the Des Plaines River less than 30 miles from the homes of Peterson and another missing woman, Lisa Stebic, meant one of their disappearances would be solved. But testing done on the remains showed they belonged to a male, police said. Officials had to conduct further testing on the ""partial skeletal remains,"" consisting of a rib cage, spinal column and partial left and right femur, after a preliminary autopsy did not reveal any identifying information. A marine cleanup crew discovered the remains in Channahon, Illinois, last week along with shreds of blue jeans and a small amount of money. Stacy Peterson, 23 when she was last seen in October 2007, was former police officer Drew Peterson's fourth wife. They lived in Bolingbrook, Illinois, 20 miles from where the remains were discovered. Her husband has been named a suspect in her disappearance, but he has maintained his innocence, saying she left him for another man. The ex-officer's stepbrother told police he helped Drew Peterson move a heavy blue barrel shortly after his wife's disappearance. Police uncover skeletal remains » . So when news came that a few days before the remains were discovered a woman named Michelle Williams found a blue barrel in the same area, many people expected Stacy Peterson had been found. Though her case still remains a mystery, her family remains hopeful there will be a solution. Drew Peterson was indicted May 7 on charges he killed his third wife, Kathleen Savio. Savio died while the two were in the midst of a nasty divorce. The death was originally deemed an accident, but authorities took a second look at the case after Stacy Peterson's disappearance. Drew Peterson has pleaded not guilty. Others had suspected the remains could be those of Lisa Stebic. Channahon is 15 miles from Plainfield, Illinois, where Stebic was last seen in April 2007. On the day she disappeared, she petitioned a court to have her husband, Craig, evicted from their Plainfield home. Craig Stebic told police he was working in the backyard when his 37-year-old wife left home about 6 p.m., taking her cell phone and purse. Authorities have said they believe that Lisa Stebic was the victim of foul play and have named Craig Stebic a suspect.","NEW: Testing reveals remains belong to a male, officials say .

"(CNN) -- One of three female undocumented immigrants who were allegedly kidnapped and assaulted was rescued at the south Texas residence of a U.S. Border Patrol agent who was found dead inside, authorities said Thursday. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said it and other federal and local agencies began a search Wednesday after finding an injured woman who told agents that she and two other women had been assaulted by a man. Investigators found the second woman and continued searching for the third alleged victim. Early Thursday, Mission, Texas, police and members of the Hidalgo County Sheriff's Office, along with federal agents, went to the home of the agent and found him dead, the CBP and FBI said in statements. They entered the home after receiving ""further information."" Officers freed the third woman believed to have been kidnapped. Mission is in extreme southern Texas, near the Mexican border. The agencies didn't identify the agent or cite a possible manner of death. It was not clear where the alleged abductions took place. The FBI said it is investigating the incident as a kidnapping and assault. The three women were being provided medical care, the CBP said. ""CBP takes this incident extremely seriously and we are fully cooperating with the investigation,"" the agency said. ""CBP holds its employees to the highest ethical standards.

"London (CNN) -- Former News of the World journalist and royal editor Clive Goodman told a court in London Thursday that Princess Diana had leaked a royal phone book to him, UK media reported. Goodman, who denies two counts of conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office, told the court that Diana had sent a phone directory and other details about the royal household to the newspaper's office in east London, the Press Association news agency reported. He said Diana, who separated from husband Prince Charles in 1992 after 11 years of marriage, had been in need of ""an ally"" at a very difficult time, the news agency said. ""She told me she wanted me to see the scale of her husband's staff and household, compared with others,"" the Press Association quoted Goodman as saying. ""She felt she was being swamped by people close to his household. She was looking for an ally to take him on -- to show there were forces that would rage against him."" One so-called ""Green Book,"" containing confidential phone numbers of royals and their staff, arrived at his office in an envelope with his name on it, Goodman said. Goodman told the court he did not pay for the information, the Press Association reported. Charles and Diana divorced in 1996. Diana died a year later, after the car she was riding in slammed into a pillar in a Paris overpass. Her boyfriend, Dodi Fayed, and their driver, Henri Paul, also died. Goodman is one of seven people on trial on phone hacking charges. Others include Rebekah Brooks, former chief executive of News International and onetime editor of The Sun and News of the World newspapers, and Andy Coulson, a former News of the World editor who went on to work for Prime Minister David Cameron. They deny the charges against them. The jury has previously been told that Goodman pleaded guilty in 2007 to phone hacking charges. The News of the World was closed down by News International, a UK division of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., in 2011 amid public outrage over claims its employees had hacked the voice mail of a British schoolgirl who went missing and was later found murdered in 2002.","Report: Ex-News of the World royal editor says Diana passed him confidential information .

"Washington (CNN) -- Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley is laying the groundwork for a presidential campaign with the intent of being ready should Hillary Clinton not run, a source close to the governor told CNN. O'Malley amplified 2016 speculation when he told the Washington Post last week that he can't wait for the former first lady and secretary of state to make a decision. He told CNN on Monday that he was working toward offering ""a better direction for our country."" Sounds like he's planning to go for it, right? Not quite. O'Malley is angling to be the person who could step in should Clinton decide to forgo a second White House candidacy. She's the odd-on favorite in early polls to capture the Democratic nomination should she throw her hat in the ring. ""The big question isn't what happens if she runs, it's what happens if she doesn't,"" the source said. ""In that sense, he is trying to lay the groundwork so that Democrats aren't left without any potential candidates."" Though, there's always Vice President Joe Biden, whose considering a bid, and a number of other Democrats in and out of Washington who would probably take a shot. But outside of Biden, who can probably wait a little longer than most due to his name recognition and certain advantages associated with his office, no one else outside of O'Malley is setting themselves up as he is for becoming Clinton's understudy. And that may be with good reason, as an O'Malley vs. Clinton race would likely be an uphill slog for the governor. A CNN/ORC International poll this week showed 70% of Democrats support her nomination. Note, Clinton was the heavy favorite in 2008 only to be overtaken by Barack Obama. But no one in the potential Democratic field is seen at this early moment as electrifying and transformational as Obama was that year. Instead of stoking speculation, the source said O'Malley is being a good party man. He's helping President Barack Obama's initiatives, helping to build infrastructure for 2014 and supporting candidates as he travels the country. Clinton lurks in corner of Republican meeting . Looking more closely, here how it breaks down for O'Malley and what's likely influencing his thinking around Hillary Clinton and a presidential run. 1. Numbers: If you aren't named Hillary Clinton, the reality is that most Democrats don't want to nominate you for President. And for O'Malley, who has little name recognition outside the Mid-Atlantic, the numbers are particularly stark. In last month's Washington Post/ABC News poll, O'Malley didn't register as one of the candidates Democrats would choose for 2016. In a November 2013 CNN/ ORC International Poll, 2% of Democrats said they would like to see O'Malley nominated for President in 2016. Stoking speculation -- and traveling the country to support candidates -- will certainly raise his profile. But name recognition might be only part of O'Malley's problem. In a Washington Post poll early last year, only 8% of Maryland Democrats -- people who likely know the governor's record -- said they would back him in a hypothetical nomination in 2016. Clinton, on the other hand, was preferred by 56% of Maryland Democrats. 2. Money: O'Malley's ""O' Say Can You See PAC"" announced it raised $1.6 million in 2013, money that was used to help a number of state and local candidates. Sure, that money is nothing to sneeze at, but fundraising off the Clinton name is substantially more lucrative. For example, Ready for Hillary -- a super PAC urging Clinton to run -- raised more than $4 million in 2013. 3. Politics: If O'Malley were to run, he'd be running from the left of the Democratic Party. And while that would fit his record, there seems to little room in the race for a liberal candidate. For the past eight years, O'Malley has led Maryland as a proud liberal. He has tightened gun laws, implemented a progressive tax code and helped legalize same-sex marriage. He also expanded the state's health care rolls and championed Obamacare. The governor is now, less than a year before he leaves the office, pushing for the cherry on top of his governing record: a raise of the Maryland minimum wage to $10.10. And while Clinton would support most -- if not all -- of the proposals O'Malley has pursued, new polling shows the space for a liberal alternative to Clinton isn't that big. A CNN/ORC International Poll out Monday showed only 10% of Democrats said they would want someone more liberal than Clinton. 4. History: At Annapolis' City Dock in May 2007, O'Malley proudly endorsed Clinton's bid for the presidency, telling the assembled media that ""She is ready today. She is ready to lead."" O'Malley wasn't just your average supporter, either. During the 2008 primaries -- which pitted Clinton against then-Sen. Barack Obama -- O'Malley was outspoken and raised a substantial amount of money. He was one of the first governors to endorse Clinton. He was even among the Clinton campaign's ""Hillraisers,"" a group of loyal Democrats who funneled more than $100,000 in donations to the campaign. The point of all this: Should Clinton run in 2016, O'Malley would likely be a supporter. Biden: Clinton won't really affect his 2016 decision .","Maryland governor laying the groundwork for a presidential run in case Hillary Clinton doesn't run .

"(CNN) -- The news broke on the eve of Grammy Awards, the music industry's biggest night: The woman with the pitch-perfect voice who once reigned as the queen of pop at the awards show had died. Whitney Houston was found dead Saturday by her bodyguard on the fourth floor of an upscale Beverly Hills hotel where only hours later she was to attend a pre-Grammy bash hosted by her longtime mentor, Clive Davis. Her death, at age 48, was the final chapter of a storied career that began with the nurturing by superstar cousin Dionne Warwick, soared in the 1980s and 1990s with one record-setting achievement after another, stalled as her drug use and marriage to Bobby Brown made for tabloid fodder and was on the rebound with a highly anticipated star turn. ""You're going to remember where you were when you heard the news. It's that significant. She was undoubtedly one of the greatest superstars of all time,"" music producer Simon Cowell said. ""One of the greatest voices in our lifetime we're likely ever to hear. And to hear this news, it really, really, really upset me."" Houston's voice, once described by The New York Times as ""peerless,"" influenced and inspired a new generation of singers, from Mariah Carey to Christina Aguilera, and garnered a legion of fans. ""Her notes soared to places most singers dream of reaching,"" Aguilera said. Houston seemed destined for stardom almost from the very beginning. Born on August 9, 1963, in Newark, New Jersey, to gospel great Cissy Houston, cousin to both Dionne and Dee Dee Warwick and goddaughter to Aretha Franklin, Houston's upbringing was the embodiment of musical greatness. Grief flows at hotel where Houston died . She honed her vocal skills from a young age, singing in the church choir and taking the stage occasionally with her mother. As a teenager, she sang backup for Chaka Khan on ""I'm Every Woman,"" a song Houston would re-record in 1992 and that would go on to become one of her biggest hits. As the story goes, Clive Davis spotted Houston in 1983 in a New York nightclub performing and signed her on the spot. Houston released her debut album, ""Whitney Houston,"" in February 1985 to wide acclaim. Rolling Stone magazine called her ""one of the most exciting new voices in years."" With the release of the album, her commanding voice combined with a natural beauty and a clean-cut image made her an instant star. Fans: Whitney Houston's music spanned an era . A generation danced their way through the 1980s to a string of her hits, including the poppy ""How Will I Know,"" ""Saving All My Love For You,"" ""I Wanna Dance With Somebody"" and ""The Greatest Love Of All."" But it was in the 1990s that she shot into the superstar stratosphere with two songs that showcased her stunning octave range and her maturity. On January 27, 1991, while the United States was at war in the Persian Gulf, Houston performed ""The Star Spangled Banner"" at Super Bowl XXV to a record 79 million viewers. During a time when the country seemed divided by the war, her searing, heartfelt performance seemed to unite a nation at least for a few minutes. Her rendition -- the gold standard by which all performances of the national anthem are judged -- was released as a single and reached the Top 20 on the U.S. Hot 100 Billboard. Houston's version was re-released in 2001 following the September 11 terrorist attacks, and proceeds from the sales were donated to charity. That was followed up by her cover of Dolly Parton's ""I Will Always Love You"" recorded for the movie ""The Bodyguard,"" in which she also made her acting debut. Stunned celebrities mourn Whitney Houston . While the movie received mostly poor reviews, the song went onto to sell 10 million singles, winning Grammy's record of the year and best female pop vocal. The soundtrack was named album of the year. ""I will always be grateful and in awe of the wonderful performance she did on my song and I can truly say from the bottom of my heart, 'Whitney, I will always love you. You will be missed,'"" Parton said. But by the time the movie opened, Houston's clean-cut pop image had begun to tarnish with her marriage to R&B bad boy Bobby Brown. The two met in 1989 and married three years later. HLNtv.com: What about Bobbi Kristina Brown? Their relationship became tabloid fodder, with every misstep chronicled and the couple's relationship a subject of constant speculation. Brown's notorious hard-partying led him to several run-ins with the law and stints in jail. While Houston managed to maintain a successful music and movie career through the end of the 1990s, starring in ""The Preacher's Wife"" and ""Waiting To Exhale,"" her behavior turned increasingly erratic amid reports of heavy drug use. By the 2000s, her career was in free fall as her album sales dropped off and her voice began to show signs of wear. The rumors were further fueled by her gaunt appearance and crass behavior on the 2005 short-lived Bravo reality show ""Being Bobby Brown,"" which she later said in an interview she only did to try to save her marriage. The couple, who had a daughter together, divorced in 2007. Brown performed at a ""New Edition"" concert Saturday night in South Haven, Mississippi. ""The atmosphere felt bittersweet,"" said iReporter Moshiu Knox, who attended the concert with his wife. ""Bobby was crying during his performance and at one point had to walk off stage. ... The crowd was emotional and tears were flowing all over the arena."" Video of the concert shows Brown asking the audience to pray for the couple's daughter. ""If you find the time, can you say a prayer for me because I'm going to need it,"" he says. In an infamous interview in 2002 with ABC's Diane Sawyer, Houston admitted to using drugs but denied the use of crack. ""Crack is wack,"" she said, quoting a line taken from Keith Haring mural painted in 1986. It was during the same interview, she told Sawyer: ""The biggest devil is me. I'm either my best friend or my worst enemy."" Houston bounced in and out of drug rehab twice, declaring herself drug-free during a 2009 interview with Oprah Winfrey, though an Australian tour that same year was fraught with reviews that she sounded ""croaky"" and, at times, appeared disoriented. Recently, Houston was working to turn around her career -- and image -- with a star turn in the upcoming movie ""Sparkle,'' the remake of a 1976 film that is said to be loosely inspired by the Supremes. The night Houston died she was to be a guest of honor at Davis' annual pre-Grammy bash. ""She loved music and she loved this night that celebrated music,"" Davis told party-goers. ""Her family asked that we carry on."" She would have loved that, too.

"(EW.com) -- The film industry was devastated by two recent deaths that have led to a movement to alter this Sunday's ""in memoriam"" segment of the Oscars telecast: One was the natural causes passing of comedy filmmaker Harold Ramis, 69, and the other was the accidental death of camera assistant Sarah Jones, 27, who was struck by a train in Georgia while working on a biopic of rock musician Gregg Allman. Ramis, the star of ""Ghostbusters"" and ""Stripes,"" and director of ""Vacation,"" ""Caddyshack"" and ""Groundhog Day,"" died on Monday at his home in Chicago, while Jones, whose credits include ""Midnight Rider"" (the film that led to her death) and the TV series ""The Vampire Diaries,"" was killed last Thursday while filming on a bridge that authorities said was supposed to be off-limits to the production. Due to the questions surrounding her death, her name has become a rallying cry for behind-the-scenes workers calling for more scrutiny of on-set safety, and it has also led to a movement. Many are signing petitions and making telephone calls asking the producers of the Oscars to include her in the telecast's tribute. But ... that effort misunderstands how that part of the show is created. Film crew worker's tragic death prompts Hollywood movement . Under most circumstances, a film worker in Jones' position would not be included in the telecast's tribute. That's not meant as a dismissal of her, or her job, but there are many thousands of people employed by the entertainment industry, and — for better or worse — the Oscars tend to focus only on the deaths of those who are familiar to the public at large. If not, you could expect the ""in memoriam"" segment to take up the entire 3-and-a-half-hour running time of the telecast. But yes, there certainly have been times when exceptions were made. At the 83rd annual ceremony, publicist Ronni Chasen was included after being gunned down while driving home from a movie premiere, even though her name was only well-known within the film industry. There's no question the Academy could make a change if it wanted — particularly if it was a matter of sending a message about on-set safety. But the decision is not up to the producers — this year, Craig Zadan and Neil Meron — so efforts to flood their offices with letters, emails, phone calls, and a bombardment of tweets is simply taking the argument to the wrong people. (The producers themselves did not immediately return a call for comment.) While they control much of the content of the telecast, there are two elements of the Oscars over which they have no say: the ""in memoriam"" reel and tickets to the show. This is partly designed to protect whomever is producing the show — a way of preventing them from getting deluged by requests for either. Oscars 2014: A Vegas oddsmaker ranks the races . So who decides? That would be a committee made up from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, who sift through a list of about 300 submissions and decide yea or nay on who makes the cut, depending on their contribution to filmmaking. Roughly 40 end up being included in the film, which is created weeks in advance of the Oscars. The producers are given the list, and then commission the film. And almost every year, the names of those left out tend to cause an uproar. The film can be re-edited at the last minute, and that is very likely going to be the case with Ramis — a decades-long presence in the TV and film business, responsible for some of the most memorable and thoughtful comedies of the past 30 years. But if he does make the cut, it is those achievements that are being commemorated, not just his demise. And his last-minute addition will come at the behest of the Academy, not the producers. In the case of Sarah Jones, it's very possible that all the film crews who are galvanized to action by her death could make a compelling case for her inclusion in the broadcast. But that case has to be made to the Academy, and not the producers, who can do nothing but refer such requests to AMPAS. (All while trying to put a show on this Sunday.) Those who hope the Oscars will take a stand on this issue should be sure to make their request in the right direction. It may be too late for this year, but those who believe in this cause could also benefit from making sure it's remembered a year from now. See the original story at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- Morocco's king revoked on Sunday the pardon of a convicted Spanish pedophile that sparked angry protests in the North African nation. ""King Mohammed VI has decided to withdraw the pardon previously accorded to Daniel Galvan Vina,"" the royal office announced on its official website on Sunday. The statement said the ""exceptional revocation"" was ordered by the king because of the ""gravity of the crimes committed by the person concerned, as well as out of respect for victims' rights."" According to official newspapers, Galvan was convicted of raping 11 Moroccan children and sentenced 30 years in prison in September 2011. The children ranged in age from 4 to 14. Galvan, a retired professor, was arrested in December 2010 after he was found with CDs and external storage units containing pornographic images of him raping children. It was unclear whether Galvan had left the country, as several media reported, but the monarchy said the king has ordered the Minister of Justice to speak with his Spanish counterpart about the actions that would follow the revocation of the pardon. On Friday, hundreds of angry demonstrators protested outside the country's Parliament building in Rabat, the capital, to protest the royal pardon, according to media reports and social media websites. A statement posted on the official Moroccan monarchy website on Saturday said that the king had not been informed of the details about the case. The king ""has not been informed on all gravity of the despicable crimes committed by this person,"" the statement said. The monarchy also said that it will investigate what led to Galvan's release. Galvan was one of 48 Spanish prisoners who were pardoned. King Juan Carlos of Spain thanked King Mohammed for his action, according to a statement on the Moroccan monarchy's site dated July 31. Meanwhile, Moroccans on social media are trying to organize another protest in the next few days.","King Mohammed VI of Morocco withdraws pedophile's pardon after protests .

"(CNN) -- On Sunday evening, as I was diligently not watching the Super Bowl, the e-mails started arriving: Had I seen that Chrysler commercial of Bob Dylan's? Wasn't it ridiculous, Dylan selling out to an Italian-owned car company in the most expensive television ad buy of the year? Because I've written about Dylan as well as for his official website, friends and occasional strangers contact me from time to time furious about his latest corrupt outrage, proclaiming he has finally destroyed whatever shred of integrity he had left. I heard it in 2011, when Dylan supposedly sold out by performing a concert in repressive China. I had heard it four years earlier, when he appeared in his first car ad for Cadillac, which just happened to be sponsoring a satellite radio show he was hosting at the time. I heard it three years before when he turned up in his cowboy troubadour duds wandering around a beautiful scantily clad model in a Victoria's Secret ad. To borrow one of the late Pete Seeger's lyrics: When will they ever learn? Dylan has been accused of selling out for 50 years, beginning in 1962 when he signed a recording contract with a big-time label, Columbia Records. Two years later, the left-wing commissars of the folk revival denounced him for writing inward-looking emotional songs instead of ""protest"" anthems. Soon thereafter came the rage at his writing for and playing with electric blues and rock musicians, a supposed betrayal of folk purity. And so it has continued, from the sellouts of his going country on ""Nashville Skyline"" and later, writing gospel music, to today's shilling for soft-core porn lingerie and poisonous gas guzzlers. Always, the sanctimonious detractors cling to a bygone Dylan: a skinny, tousled-haired genius in a work shirt singing ""Blowin' in the Wind"" and ""The Times They Are a-Changin."" This, supposedly, is the true Dylan that the actual man has desecrated. In fact, the profane actual Dylan is worse than corrupt: He is the vile betrayer of a revolution in consciousness of which he had once been the avatar. But Dylan renounced that role 50 years ago. Choosing art over politics, he broke free of the moral absolutism of ""protest"" music that he mocked in ""My Back Pages"" in 1964: ""Ah, but I was so much older then/I'm younger than that now."" He rejected the idea of his being the avatar of anything, let alone of a revolution in consciousness. ""It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,"" he sang in ""Wedding Song,"" from 1973, ""nor is it my intention to sound a battle charge."" And so I started to write back to my complaining friends to say that they had totally missed what Dylan has been about for decades -- not a moral or spiritual guide, let alone an exemplar, or a prophet, or a savior, but a working songwriter and musician, doing his job as best he can -- which, astonishingly often, turns out to be sublime -- and making the money he deserves. Then I watched the commercial on YouTube and saw that my riposte was inadequate. For Dylan, breaking free of the folkie left and choosing art over politics never meant renouncing political concerns or themes, any more than turning to rock meant repudiating folk music. Any conception of art as broad as Dylan's necessarily includes politics, as politics is part of the human endeavor. And the Chrysler ad, while captivating us with Dylan's very presence, contains a political subtext. Although the ad is dopey as all ads are, and even though it is plainly hawking Chrysler, Dylan never once hypes the virtues of Chrysler's product over that of any other automobile maker. This may be a cunningly subtle pitch to Dylan's baby boomer fan base, but it's also an abnormal nonspecific celebrity endorsement. Instead, Dylan celebrates America as a car-loving country. The ad begins with a clunky, even insipid piece of ad copy -- ""There's nothing more American than America"" -- only barely redeemed by being spoken by Dylan's singular voice. But then comes a jumble of images out of Dylan's familiar Americana landscape -- old-fashioned diners, Route 66 in Missouri, bronco busters, carnivals, Marilyn Monroe -- evoking a particular nostalgic national mystique, rooted in the 1940s and 1950s and redolent of Jack Kerouac. Footage of old Detroit follows -- ""Yeah...,"" Dylan says, ""Detroit made cars, and cars made America"" -- and then a paean, in prose almost certainly written by Dylan himself, to ""the American road and the creatures who live on it"" and to how we Americans ""believe in the zoom and the roar and the thrust."" The ad is saying that America is what its people make and make of it, cars above all, which makes sense -- and which also makes it a workingman's film: The ad doesn't single out Chrysler and its cars but the Americans who build those cars, and their conviction and pride -- ""the heart and soul of every man and woman working on the line,"" Dylan intones. ""So let Germany brew your beer, let Switzerland make your watch, let Asia assemble your phone. We ... will build ... your car"" -- the last sentence delivered in Dylan's cool halting cadence. It's all, of course, a cleverly deceptive way to elide the fact that supposedly all-American Chrysler is now owned by Fiat. But the cars are still American-made -- and for Dylan, that's important. In one of his early protest songs, ""North Country Blues,"" Dylan sang of the mines of his native Minnesota Iron Range being shut down and people left in despair, because for the greedy owners it was ""much cheaper down/ in South American towns/where the miners work almost for nothing."" Twenty years later, in ""Union Sundown,"" he bitterly lamented what had now become known as outsourcing, including American cars being assembled in Argentina ""by a guy making 30 cents a day."" ""Workingman's Blues #2,"" from 2006, complained of how ""they say low wages are a reality/if we want to compete abroad."" Pro-labor protectionism does not spring to mind as one of the great causes of the 1960s. But for Bob Dylan, a product of the 1940s and 1950s, one article of simple justice has always been that American working people, so vital to his vanishing American landscape, ought not to be victimized by bosses who will happily exploit the pauper labor of the rest of the world. Apparently, Dylan is sold on the idea that, in Detroit anyway, that injustice has been halted and even reversed. And that, he wants us to know, is a good reason, and maybe the best, to buy one of Chrysler's cars.

"(CNN) -- Contradicting claims by a coroner and her family, a new report by San Francisco authorities concludes 16-year-old Ye Meng Yuan was already dead when two fire trucks ran over her on the Northern California airport's tarmac. The official accident investigation prepared by San Francisco International Airport and city fire department officials -- submitted earlier this month but not revealed publicly until Wednesday, states that ""ample evidence refutes"" the contention that Ye was killed by the vehicles. At least three firefighters determined that the Chinese teenager -- who, it was determined, wasn't wearing a seatbelt when she was ejected from Asiana Flight 214 as it crashed July 6 -- was dead before she was struck, the report found. ""As trained mass casualty responders, the firefighters moved onto other immediate tasks"" after quickly determining Ye had died, the report said. ""Tragically and regretfully, two ... vehicles later rolled over the deceased during active firefighting operations."" One person who doesn't buy this argument is San Mateo County Coroner Robert Foucrault, who performed the autopsy on Ye's body. He determined she died of blunt trauma injuries. Asiana victims sue Boeing . Foucrault said he was giving ""an unbiased review"" and ""doesn't have a dog in this,"" but said of the investigation's finding: ""It is not factually accurate."" The coroner added: ""(Her injuries were) consistent with being run over by a motor vehicle and there is overwhelming physical and scientific evidence to support she was run over."" Fourcrault isn't alone. Earlier this month, a lawyer for Ye's family said video shows several firefighters saw her lying on the tarmac, but none ""did the basic step of checking if she was alive."" ""It's unthinkable,"" the attorney, Justin Green, told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360."" ""It's unimaginable, because the first thing -- the first priority of the firefighters or any rescue personnel -- is saving lives, and the first step in triage is to take the pulse, check the respiration. That was never done."" The 16-year-old was on her way to an American summer camp from her home in China when the crash happened. She and the two other victims -- one of whom died six days later -- were sitting in the back of the plane when they were ejected as the Boeing 777 crashed. The investigation determined that one first responder first thought Ye was a doll after noticing her in front of the plane's left wing amid a debris cloud. Several firefighters determined ""very early in the response"" that she was dead but did not move her body, in part so they could devote their time to helping others and also so as not to move it before other officials could inspect it, the report said. They were all part of an intense, sizable firefighting and rescue effort. Most of the more than 300 people on board began leaving the plane on their own accord within 90 seconds of impact, though five people -- including the three who died -- were ejected and five others were taken off by firefighters. All the while, crews were battling flames inside and outside the aircraft. ""Unique among recent airplane accidents in the United States, the incident resulted in more than 300 persons receiving triage in the midst of heavy rescue and firefighting activity with the potential for an imminent explosion."" The new report lamented the lack of a firm protocol for first responders on what they should do when there's a fatality at the same time as an active firefighting operation involving fast-moving crews, but did not say firefighters erred or caused Ye's death. San Mateo County District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe announced last October that a firefighter who accidentally ran over her body would not face charges. The San Francisco investigation report appears unlikely to please those who believe the Chinese teen was alive until vehicles hit her. Talking about the dispute over how Ye died, Foucrault -- the San Mateo County coroner -- said, ""It's unfortunate that it's come to this."" Firefighters saw injured girl before she was run over .","Ye Meng Yuan, 16, was one of three killed when Asiana Flight 214 crashed .

"(CNN) -- Bryan and Donna Scott married a year and a half after meeting on the beach in their home state of Florida. For their wedding, they received several antiques that they often spent weekends fixing up. The hobby became a habit as they frequented garage and estate sales, looking for old lighting fixtures they could make new. Eventually, requests came in from family and friends who wanted them, and then from an online store Bryan set up. By 2008, when recession caused many small businesses to close shop, the Scotts left their day jobs to grow the business, Barn Light Electric Company. ""I always tell people I became an accidental business owner,"" founder and owner Bryan said. ""It just happened. It was so successful and grew so much."" The Scotts, both 48, left careers in law enforcement and nursing to focus on Barn Light. The company, based in Titusville, Florida, manufactures and sells vintage-inspired lighting fixtures and has expanded into other industrial-styled goods. Last year, Scott reported, the company pulled in $10 million in revenue. It wasn't always easy. They used their first profits to pay off bills in the event their success was only a flash. ""After we quit our jobs, it was scary at that point. I didn't know if it was going to last,"" he said. Going from ""fixed income to being responsible for your own paycheck,"" they realized that the livelihood of their three children and then-staff of three employees depended on Barn Light's success. It motivated them to keep working hard and stay grounded. They've been married for 29 years, Scott said, and building Barn Light made them stronger. He is the ""gas,"" and Donna is the ""bricks,"" he said of their collaborative management of the company; he runs the manufacturing while she heads the administration, sales and marketing. He has some advice for others interested in turning their hobbies into a business. ""First, have a passion for what you're doing and don't approach it as a money-making opportunity,"" he said. ""Second, find that unserved niche within your hobby and aggressively go after it. Third, be a good blogger/copywriter or find someone who can do this for you."" Scott attributes their success largely to being unique. They're manufacturing vintage-inspired lighting styles and specialize in porcelain enamel finishes, a process the company says ""has not been seen in America for over 50 years."" The company bought the patents of old lighting businesses, including Benjamin Electric Manufacturing Company, and allows employees and customers to suggest ideas for new styles. A sense of family within the workplace and a strong connection to their Florida town has helped sustain and grow the business, they said. The Scotts both grew up in Titusville, famous for the Kennedy Space Center. They've hired an eclectic group of employees, including longtime workers on the space shuttle program, coal miners and about a dozen convicted felons with whom that Bryan developed relationships and offered a second chance. ""They put heart and soul into the company. [They're] some of our best workers,"" Scott said, and noted that some of them are now in managerial positions. Johnny Bragg, manufacturing general manager for Barn Light and Bryan Scott's uncle, calls Barn Light the best job he's ever had. ""I'm a veteran. I like American-made products,"" he said. ""Employees take pride in their work."" Bragg thinks of his fellow employees as close friends, he said. They ""don't just leave because it's the end of the day but because they've done a good job for Barn Light."" The company pays well, employees said, and has a sense of humor, too. After a string of visitors became pregnant after drinking from a certain water fountain, they hung a sign that says, ""Warning! Drinking from this water may cause pregnancy."" One employee's wife intentionally drank from the fountain to test the myth -- and turned out to be pregnant. They grew from a spare bedroom, to the garage, to a storefront and eventually, to three facilities -- shipping and assembly, porcelain enamel production and administration. The company is planning a move into one large building to bring their 80 employees under one roof in September, although projected growth suggests they might need to move in a few years. Locals may see a new building and go ""Oh, its Barn Light, they're getting bigger again,"" Barn Light's communications coordinator Betty Lynne said. ""It speaks to his heart,"" Lynne says of Bryan and the work ethic of the couple. ""He's one of the few people I know that loves going to work every day and loves what he does.""","Barn Light Electric Company started as an interest in refurbishing antique lighting .

"(CNN) -- Before I started working on the documentary ""The Cove,"" I assumed like many others that dolphins and orcas enjoyed living at Sea World and other marine parks. They always seemed to be smiling, jumping merrily around their tanks, eager to put on a show for human spectators. However, when I met Ric O'Barry, my perspective changed. O'Barry was the man responsible for capturing Kathy -- the original ""Flipper"" -- from the wild and helping to create the language used to train dolphins to do tricks and flips. When Cathy died in his arms some years later, O'Barry realized the whole process of capturing and training dolphins was wrong. He eventually co-wrote the book ""Behind the Dolphin's Smile,"" where he explains that the smiles you see on these animals are not true reflections of happiness. In actuality, they hate to be enclosed in their holding tanks and are often not fed until it is time to perform their daily routines. During his time as a trainer, O'Barry learned dolphins had true feelings -- they would get depressed, stressed out, even suicidal. In some parks, the trainers have to give the animals Maalox and Tagamet to treat the ulcers that develop from their stress. The horrific tragedy that occurred last week at SeaWorld in Orlando, Florida, has left me deeply shaken. My heart goes out to Dawn Brancheau and her family. Dawn lost her life doing the job that she loved, yet I -- like O'Barry -- believe that this job should no longer exist. We know now that the whale involved in this accident has a well-documented history of violent behavior. SeaWorld knew of this history yet continued to exploit the animal and endanger the lives of its employees to put money in its pockets. If this isn't a wake-up call, I don't know what is. At this very moment, a dozen boats in the town of Taiji, Japan, are heading out and rounding up hundreds of dolphins in a secluded cove. The fisherman will close off the cove with nets, and with the help of employees from various dolphinariums, they will try to find the next ""Flipper"" among their catch. The fishermen will snatch these beautiful creatures from their natural habitats, hoist them into nets, load them onto airplanes and drop them into a cement tank in the middle of Turkey, Korea or other nearby Asian countries. In some ways, these animals are the lucky ones. These dolphins escaped the fate of many of their pod mates, who are brutally slaughtered with primitive harpoons -- turning the cove into a scene straight from Melville's ""Moby Dick."" The water turns bright red with the blood of the slain. The fishermen then transport the meat -- despite health concerns of mercury content in the dolphins' systems -- back to shore, where they sell it to local vendors. It's time for us to step up and make a difference in these animals' lives. Until we make marine parks obsolete, dolphins and other sea mammals will continue to be senselessly captured and slaughtered. We can no longer fall for the argument that SeaWorld shows ""make us love the dolphins and want to understand and protect them"" -- this couldn't be further from the truth. As I see it, we will only truly love and understand these animals when we can watch them running wild and genuinely smiling in their natural habitat. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Fisher Stevens.","Dolphins seem to be smiling, but captive ones experience stress, Fisher Stevens says .
Stevens says captive dolphin trade leads to slaughter of the animals .
Until we make marine parks obsolete, dolphin trade will continue, Stevens says ."
"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A six-year-old boy, whose eyes were gouged out in an attack in China in August this year, has been discharged from hospital after receiving prosthetic eye implants. A spokesperson from the C-MER Dennis Lam Eye Hospital in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen told CNN that Guo Bin had left the hospital on Thursday afternoon after a farewell ceremony and would return to his hometown in Shanxi province . During his three-month stay at the hospital, he was given orbital implant surgery that restored his appearance, but not his sight, the South China Morning Post reported. The boy, also known as Xiao Binbin, was all smiles as he appeared hand-in-hand with his parents when leaving the hospital, where he received free treatment from Hong Kong doctor Dennis Lam, the paper added. The boy was found bloodied and in a drugged state with both eyes missing near his home in late August. He'd been missing for four hours. Chinese police said his late aunt was the prime suspect in the horrific attack, state media news agency Xinhua reported. The boy's aunt, Zhang Huiying, killed herself two days after the incident by jumping into a well in the courtyard of her home. Police said Zhang's DNA was found at the scene of her nephew's attack. Blood stains belonging to the boy were also found on Zhang's clothes. Early reports suggested that Guo may have been the victim of organ traffickers, claims police later denied. Guo will receive rehabilitation for his loss of sight and will need to replace his prosthetic eye pieces in six months, the South China Morning Post added.","A Chinese boy whose eyes were gouged out in an attack in August has been discharged from hospital .

"Washington (CNN) -- Federal aviation authorities say they are investigating a string of events that began Monday when a pilot spilled coffee on a cockpit panel, leading to a false hijack warning and culminating in the plane's emergency landing in Canada. At issue: Did United Airlines warn pilots not to hold beverages over the plane's electronics-laden console? The incident occurred on United Airlines Flight 940, a Boeing 777-200 headed from Chicago to Frankfurt, Germany. According to Canadian transportation officials, the pilot spilled coffee on the aircraft's radio equipment, located on the center console of the cockpit. The crew advised controllers they had communication problems and subsequently reported they were experiencing navigation problems, the officials said. A United Airlines spokesman confirmed that a crew member's beverage spilled ""during a period of light turbulence,"" but said the pilot remained in contact with air traffic control and followed standard operating procedures. A source familiar with the incident told CNN that after the pilot switched to a backup radio system, the plane briefly sent out a transponder signal indicating it had been hijacked. The source declined to explain how that happened. But pilots contacted by CNN said the signal could have been sent if one of the pilots inadvertently hit the transponder knob while cleaning up the spill. Or, they said, it could have happened if the pilot had tried to send a different transponder code indicating the plane had communication problems. The pilot made the decision to make an emergency landing in Toronto rather than continue the trans-oceanic flight, officials said. Federal Aviation Administration officials said Wednesday that pilots are allowed to have beverages in the cockpit, noting that many aircraft cockpits have cup holders. But they pointed to a rule prohibiting pilots from ""any activity ... such as eating meals"" that could distract them during a ""critical phase of flight,"" typically meaning takeoffs and landings. Drinking coffee could be construed as ""eating meals,"" according to FAA spokesman Les Dorr. The agency's Certificate Management Office will investigate whether United Airlines has a policy prohibiting crew members from passing liquids over, or placing them on, the console, and whether they've communicated that policy to pilots. The FAA also will investigate whether the spilled liquid in fact caused the communications problem, or if there were other factors, Dorr said. As unlikely as a coffee spill accident may seem, a similar scenario formed the basis of a 1964 movie, ""Fate is the Hunter."" In that film, a cup of coffee spills on the plane's center console, leaking into the electronics. The leak leads to a series of events culminating in the plane's crash. The movie, coincidentally, aired Sunday night on Turner Classic Movies, the night before the United mishap. Mark Weiss, a former B-777 pilot, said a spilled drink is not likely to bring down a plane, pointing to redundant systems in aircraft. But he said it was reasonable for the pilot to land the plane. Weiss, who works for Spectrum Group, a consulting company, said liquids should not be banned from cockpits. ""Particularly on the long flights, you have to have water constantly, you have to continually hydrate your body, otherwise you run into other physiological problems,"" he said. The National Transportation Safety Board said it does not plan on investigating the mishap. ""It does not appear that this incident warrants an NTSB investigation,"" spokesman Keith Holloway said. NTSB records do not show any incidents where spilled substances were a factor in a crash, he said. CNN's Jeanne Meserve and Chuck Johnston contributed to this report.","FAA investigates policies about food, drink in the cockpit, source tells CNN .

"(CNN) -- Five hundred years ago as the Spanish and Portuguese empires were carving up the Western hemisphere into colonial spheres, Europe's imperial competition in the Indian Ocean was equally intense. As the first to navigate around Africa's southern cape in the late 15th century, Portugal landed upon India and beyond to Southeast Asia, establishing forts, outposts and colonies alongside the Arabian Sea coastal Indian kingdoms of Calicut, Kochi, Goa and Kannur, quickly wresting control of the lucrative Euro-Asian spice trade routes from the Venetians and Ottomans. Ceylon, as the island of Sri Lanka was known under Portuguese rule, became a crucial trading hub for cinnamon, cardamom, black pepper and gems through agreements with the Kingdom of Kotte, near present-day Colombo. But after Portugal's economic collapse in the 1620s, the Dutch East India Company took advantage of an invitation from the ruler of the Kingdom of Kandy to oust the Portuguese. But rather than return Portuguese forts to local control, the Dutch deepened and expanded their colonial rule of the island. When England took over Dutch colonies during the Napoleonic Wars, Sri Lanka became a British colony until independence in 1948. A half-millennium since the Portuguese arrived in South Asia, the Indian Ocean is once again the center of global maritime trade, and a rising global power, China, is underwriting the modernization of Sri Lanka's ports for its gargantuan export volumes. China's so-called ""string of pearls"" strategy has been to develop maritime access points along the Indian Ocean from Myanmar and Bangladesh to Sri Lanka and Pakistan. One has to wonder: Is Sri Lanka's location in the saddle of the ""new maritime Silk Road"" arcing from the Persian Gulf to the Straits of Malacca a blessing or a curse? Trans-shipment hub . If China is the new Portugal or Holland, it covets Sri Lanka for its geography, not its cinnamon. The island represents an ideal trans-shipment hub for Chinese goods branching off to Africa, the Arab states of the Gulf Cooperation Council such as Saudi Arabia, India -- and of course: Iran. In a world of maritime geopolitics, countries such as Oman and Sri Lanka emerge as strategic players whereas in the Cold War they were sideshows. In this context, President Mahinda Rajapaksa, like Pakistan's former President Pervez Musharraf or other Asian strongmen, knows how to ""multi-align,"" wooing outside powers and playing them off each other to minimize pressure on his regime for greater accountability. America now views Sri Lanka as increasingly strategic -- mostly because China does. The paradox of such competition is that it is precisely in the countries viewed as most strategic by multiple powers that one can least impose one's values. Rajapaksa's regime is the new Kingdom of Kandy, inviting foreigners but attempting to control their influence. British involvement . Former colonial master Britain is a perfect example. Against domestic opposition, British Prime Minister David Cameron attended the November 2013 Commonwealth summit in Colombo, where he made statements about human rights and even visited a Tamil refugee camp in the northern Jaffna peninsula. The trip contained staggering ironies. First, much of the funding for the Tamil Tigers has come from the diaspora in Britain, thus fueling and prolonging the very civil war whose brutality Cameron went to criticize. Furthermore, Cameron has recently presided over an increase in arms sales to the Rajapaksa government, including assault machine guns, pistols and ammunition, ostensibly intended for counter-piracy. But that is small change. Just one week before Cameron's visit, Sri Lanka signed $1.3 billion worth of investment projects with China, mainly to build Colombo's new 700-acre large port on reclaimed land in exchange for a 99-year lease on 100 hectares of land to China Communications Construction Company Ltd. China already built the port in the southern city of Hambantota -- which had been devastated by the 2004 tsunami originating near Indonesia -- and named it after President Rajapaksa himself. As with Pakistan, China appears to be Sri Lanka's best friend as well -- for now. Human rights . Driving alongside the site of Colombo's future port, you encounter the towering, austere Buddhist stupa erected on the site of an old Anglican church, a warning to outsiders sailing in that Sri Lanka is a confident, sovereign nation. Indeed, Sri Lanka and Myanmar have remarkable similarities as former British colonies overcoming decades of civil war through militant Buddhist regimes. Just as Myanmar's military is fighting aggressively to subdue its many ethnic tribes on the country's strategic borders, Sri Lanka continues a ruthless occupation and crackdown in the country's Tamil populated north, with continued widespread human rights violations. Sri Lanka's civil war was much more an ethnic than religious conflict, and while minority Tamils still face difficulty getting jobs against the dominant Sinhalese, the overall security improvement means a rapidly growing economic pie (Sri Lanka's growth rate is holding steady at 7%). More than a few Colombo natives of various backgrounds echoed relief that the government had finally dealt with the security situation ""by the roots,"" code for thoroughly and decisively. Like the government itself, they prefer freedom to self-criticism. Even villagers outside Colombo, who used to pack up and sleep in the nearby jungle to avoid attacks by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), can now rest peacefully at home. Like Yangon, post-civil war Colombo is undergoing a genuine architectural and cultural renaissance. Colombo renaissance . Beautifully conserved Dutch and British colonial buildings and officers' homes are being restored into hotels, restaurants and shops. Manicured laws and gardens and brimming with children at play, traditional weddings are held at the Geoffrey Bawa designed Meditation Temple along the old Dutch canal. The Fort area, once fenced off due to the constant LTTE attacks and suicide bombings, is now buzzing with yuppies of all persuasions. As in Yangon, mosques, churches and temples now thrive side-by-side. It is not only the ports that are getting a big boost from China, but most of the country's highways and roads as well. Even in a small country, there are few investments as significant to creating jobs and spreading growth and mobility as basic infrastructure. The travel time between any two cities in Sri Lanka has been cut by more than half, making it possible for visitors to explore more of the country in a single trip. The Buddhist monuments and caves of the ""Cultural Triangle"" along with the Wilpattu National Park and Alankude beaches (to which whale and dolphin watchers flock) represent a central and northwestern arc, while southern routes take one to the bustling second city of Galle, the nearby rustic seaside town of Unawatuna and Yala National Park, teeming with elephants and leopards. Among the fastest growing excursions combine luscious jungle drives and stays at luxurious resorts in manicured tea plantations, the tea-lovers equivalent of a southern France vineyard tour. Sri Lanka's strategy is to leverage Chinese and other investment to boost its own industries such as tourism, but also its main exports: textiles, garments and tea. But will it succeed in leveraging great power machinations for its own -- rather than foreign -- enrichment? After all, it wasn't just European colonizers who subjugated Sri Lanka's historical kingdoms. In 1411 -- almost a century before Portugal's arrival to the region -- Kotte kingdom ruler Alakeshvara refused to pay tribute and pledge obeisance to a visiting maritime force. As punishment, Kotte was sacked and Alakashvara and his family were shackled and sent off to bow before the emperor. The sailors were Zheng He and the 30,000 troops of his ""treasure ships,"" and the emperor was Yongle of Ming dynasty China. Read more: 5 ways to experience Sri Lanka .

"Merida, Mexico (CNN) -- There may be no one left on Earth to say TGIF this week. Some believe the world is coming to an end Friday -- on 12/21/12 -- which is when an important phase on the ancient calendar of the Mayan people terminates. Mayans don't buy it. At least the ones living in the city of Merida, Mexico, don't. Neither does anyone in the Mayan village of Yaxuna. They know the calendar their ancestors left them is about to absolve a key phase -- the end of an era and the heralding of a new one -- but they don't think we're all gonna die. Read more: Be honest, apocalypse seems kind of exciting . ""It's an era. We are lucky to see how it ends,"" said wood carver Santos Esteban in Yaxuna, a sleepy village of fewer than 700 Mayans, located in a territory that once belonged to the ancient kingdom founded around 2000 B.C. He feels it is a momentous occasion and is looking forward to the start of the new age. He is not afraid. ""Lots of people say it's the end of the world, but we don't believe that,"" he said. Read more: China cracks down on 'Doomsday cult' People in his village will keep living much as they have, preferring hand-built, palm-thatch huts to concrete buildings and baking tortillas on an open flame.

December212012.com also offers tips on survival and advertisements for the needed gear -- from gas masks to first aid kits and hand-crank radios. Comments are welcome on its Facebook page, which has more than 14,000 likes, and website owner ""John"" from near Louisville, Kentucky, sends out tweets under the handle @December212012. On the doomsday Facebook page -- in between gloomy superstitious links and user comments -- John has confessed that he does not really believe the world will end on Friday but thinks that a new era could dawn that may include some improvements for the world. That new era, however, might require a good bit of destruction as well. John asked posters not to take the whole thing too seriously. ""PLEASE PEOPLE. . . I'm begging you. Do not overreact or make any rash decisions regarding Dec 21st. Anyone who knows anything about the 2012 prophecies, including myself, does not believes that the world is going to end,"" the Facebook page says. Opinion: The Maya collapsed - could we? Gunmaker Ryan Croft in Asheville, North Carolina, does take the prediction seriously. He is building a special assault rifle to deal with any signs of doom lurking around the corner. He doesn't think life on Earth will come to a complete end Friday. ""I'm not planning for the world to go away,"" Croft told CNN affiliate WHNS. However, he thinks the day could mark the beginning of cataclysmic times introduced by a disaster. That may call for drastic measures, Croft said. His new rifle, a hybrid of an AR-15 and an AK-47, is designed to be easy to use, the Gulf War veteran said. Trouble in the United States could ensue in the wake of an economic catastrophe, he thinks. ""I taught about economic collapse and how it actually looks on the ground,"" he said. ""People want to act like it can't happen or doesn't happen, and it happens around the world. There are places on fire right now."" In true survivalist manner, Croft also teaches his family how to subsist on alternative sources of nourishment, such as algae, roasted mice and live earthworms. CNN iReport: Mayan expert offers advice . Though 12/21/12 is a somewhat congruent date on the western calendar, the Mayan version enumerates the event in a different way. The ancient people measured time in cycles called ""baktuns"" of 394 years each, and the winter solstice coming Friday marks the end of the 13th baktun. Some who study the calendar say the date for the end of the period is not Friday, but Sunday. The Mayan calendar is based on the position of the heavenly bodies -- the sun, the moon and the stars -- and was meant to tell the Mayan people about agricultural and economic trends, said archeologist Alfredo Barrera. NASA is also weighing in on the matter, with a post on its website declaring that the world will not end on Friday. ""It will be another winter solstice,"" NASA said. ""The claims behind the end of the world quickly unravel when pinned down to the 2012 timeline."" As of Thursday afternoon in the eastern United States -- already Friday across Asia -- the space agency said it had detected ""nothing unusual"" and that it anticipated a normal couple of days ahead. Read more: Hotels ready for the end of the world . The hubbub about a calamity occurring comes from a Mayan stone carving called monument 6, made in 700 A.D., which predicts a major event at the end of this baktun, Barrera said. But half of the broken tablet is missing, so one may only speculate on what the complete message may be. Whatever it is, it's not about the end of the world, he said. ""We don't have a prophecy or inscription related to the finish of the world. It just mentioned a deity."" Barrera said he believes the hullabaloo about the end of the world has been whipped up by online speculation -- and he finds it a bit ignorant. In Merida, Mayan priest Valerio Canche conducts an ancient ritual to honor the dead in light of the upcoming end of the 13th baktun. ""It is considered the closure of the great cycle of Mayan time,"" he said. ""But, of course, the cycle (14th baktun) begins the following day. For the Mayans, it's not the end of the world."" If you're reading this on Thursday, keep in mind that it's already Friday in New Zealand, and it's still on the map. If it's Friday, a look out the window may be reassuring. If it's Saturday, and no major calamity has occurred, then relax and go celebrate the beginning of the 14th baktun with the Mayans. Debunking doomsday: 6 rumors dispelled .

"(CNN) -- When the United States Postal Service announced it would no longer deliver mail on Saturdays, those of us with e-mail anxiety had a moment of jealousy. What would it be like to have two whole days when the Internet just didn't deliver to anyone's inbox? It would be pretty great. Unfortunately, e-mail is only becoming more of a round-the-clock presence, but a novel new e-mail tool could make it more manageable. Meet the Mailbox app . Mailbox is a much hyped new app for the iPhone that chips away at overflowing inboxes with simple gesture controls and a brilliant snooze feature. As of Thursday, it is finally available in the Apple App Store after half a year of sneak peeks and raves from beta testers. I've been using it for my personal e-mail and have become hooked. Developed by Orchestra, the 2-year-old Palo Alto, California, startup behind the Orchestra to-do app, Mailbox takes the familiar mobile mail app look and adds simple swipe controls for categorizing and prioritizing messages. ""We started this company on this belief that people use e-mail like a terrible to-do list,"" said Gentry Underwood, founder and CEO of Orchestra. The app's solution is to quickly get things out of your inbox that aren't urgent so you can better focus on the tasks that are important right now. It does this with four main gestures. Swipe partially to the right on a message to archive it, all the way to the right to delete it. A long drag all the way to the left can add an e-mail to a list, and a short drag brings up the app's very best feature: Snooze. Open up your e-mail and look at what's lingering in your inbox. How many are urgent tasks, and how many fall into the gray area of pending, semi-urgent, or indefinitely postponable? Instead of leaving them in your inbox where they add to the noise, Mailbox lets you breezily put them off with one gratifying tap. The Snooze feature lets you postpone a message for any length of time. Choose later today, this evening, tomorrow, this weekend, next week, in a month, someday (set for three months by default) or a specific date from the grid of icons. You won't need to see or think about those messages again until reminded at the chosen date and time. Though cleared from the inbox, nothing is really gone. All snoozed messages are organized in the Later tab and archived messages are under the Archive tab. Reaching for Inbox Zero . There are big issues with the state of modern e-mail. Mostly, there's just too much of it. There are personal messages, work conversations and never-ending group threads on important business decisions -- or where to go for lunch. The majority are e-mails generated by machines such as mailing lists, travel confirmations, store offers, bank statements and bill reminders. The inbox is filling too many roles at once, as a catch-all receptacle, to-do list and filing system. Mailbox is based on one of the more popular methods for dealing with the deluge, Inbox Zero. It's a system for clearing out clutter and handling e-mails requiring action championed by Merlin Mann, founder of the 43 Folders blog. ""There are a lot of things hanging around there that just can't be dealt with until some other time and yet they stare back at you and nag,"" said Underwood. Moving those nagging e-mails out of the way is a great goal, but many people find constantly fighting the flood in traditional e-mail clients to be more of a time suck than a time saver. Mailbox's gestures turn the process into an easy and, oddly, fun activity. Once you master the swiping gestures, the clearing process is fast and simple and requires minimal amounts of thought. You don't have to agonize over what folder that e-mail from your boss belongs in, just put it off until tomorrow morning. ""A third of our beta testers get to Inbox Zero once a week,"" said Underwood. ""When you do get to zero it doesn't mean you have nothing left to do, it means you have nothing left to do right now."" Designed for satisfaction . The app was partially inspired by Clear, a stunning to-do app that came out a year ago and wowed app designers with its fresh take on the smartphone user interface. It was all swipes and bold colors and gestures, a few new rules you had to remember but that soon made complete sense. ""Many people have heralded Clear as being one of the big moments in mobile user interface development,"" said Underwood. ""No buttons, just gestures. Man does it feel good to check something off in Clear."" Mailbox has adapted some of those satisfying features and combined them with a traditional inbox design. Like Clear, it takes a bit of practice for the gestures to become second nature, but when they do you'll execute them without hesitation. After tablets went mainstream, many people caught themselves mindlessly trying to tap or swipe non-touchscreen desktop monitors. People had picked up a new way of interfacing with a device that seemed more natural than a mouse and tiny pointer icon. The same thing happens after you use Mailbox for a while. I became more impatient with sorting through mail in my regular app, occasionally swiping to snooze a message in the default by mistake. Big dreams for future versions . The first version Mailbox app is promising, but it's still in its infancy and is far from being the savior of e-mail. Part of that is by design. Mailbox's developers are only focusing on mobile for now. The first version of the app only works on iPhones and can only be used with Gmail accounts. The demands for a mobile e-mail application are less complicated than a desktop client. On a computer, people want things like calendar and contact integration, and have complicated folder, tag and color systems. Being mobile works in Mailbox's favor. It's a great excuse to create a stripped down e-mail client and start from scratch, focusing only on the basics. ""The primary use on mobile is triage,"" said Underwood. Orchestra does plan on expanding the app over time, depending on how it's received. The company's goal is to always offer a free version of the app, but also roll out a more advanced paid version, like Evernote and Dropbox have done. There has already been so much demand that the company is taking precautions and rolling it out slowly with a wait list. When you download the app, you can reserve a spot on the list and the app will show you how many people are ahead of you. Once it's in wider use, Mailbox will likely add more features, support additional e-mail clients and develop an app for Android devices. Underwood imagines an app that manages not just e-mail accounts, but the inbox for any service with internal messages, such as LinkedIn and Facebook. A future Mailbox could even automatically chip in with the sorting, making sense of the automated e-mails like mailings and boarding passes, and even adapt based on your habits over time. And eventually, Orchestra may create a desktop version of the Mailbox app. But for now the company is practicing what it preaches and focusing on the most important task on its to do list: create a great, simple mobile e-mail app.","Mailbox is a highly anticipated iPhone app for better organizing your e-mail .
It uses swipe gestures to help quickly clear your inbox and focus on important tasks .
The app's killer feature is a snooze button, letting you ignore e-mails until later ."

"(CNN) -- Sports stars seem to have it all -- from seven-figure salaries to big endorsement deals. But lately, what some don't have is a good reputation. The NBA's Dwyane Wade started a foundation to help inspire kids in at-risk situations. With the steroids controversy in baseball and drug allegations against the world's greatest swimmer, many adoring fans may wonder, ""Where are the good guys in sports?"" Dwyane Wade of the Miami Heat is one of those good guys. He stays out of the controversy and insists that his fame should be used to help others. CNN's Nicole Lapin talked to the NBA star about the foundation he started and his partnership with National Recess Week. The following is an edited transcript of the interview. Nicole Lapin: It feels like you're getting paid for recess now. You're 27 years old. Do you look at your paycheck sometimes and are like, ""I get paid for this?  Watch more of Nicole Lapin's interview with Dwyane Wade » . Dwyane Wade: First of all, to do something that you love, and to get compensated for something that you love at a very, very great rate, is unbelievable. And it's something that a lot of kids dream of. They've just got to have somebody who believes in them. And that's something I'm trying to do with being the spokesman for this Recess Week. Y'all need to get back out there. We need to get back out there with the kids and help them believe in themselves. Lapin: Some people see you as the role model. Who was your role model growing up? Wade: You know, I had different role models growing up. Of course, I'm from Chicago, so when it comes to sports and when it comes to basketball, Michael Jordan. No question about it. But, you know, on a personal level, I always looked at people that were close to me that were doing things. My sister was always a role model to me, just because of the way that she always helped kids. And even though we didn't have much, she always helped the ones that were less fortunate than us. And it's something that just stuck with me. And it's something that I'm trying to do now. Lapin: So, as a role model, to take little kids wearing your jerseys and playing video games of you, do you take that seriously? Wade: It's still, you know, crazy to me when I see people wearing my jersey. I mean, just on a regular day. Not a game day. Just on a regular day walking down the street, see somebody with your name on their back. It's like, wow. Or when you see yourself on video games. All that to me is still, you know, mind-blowing. And the main thing, the only thing you can do is try to go out and talk to kids. You try and tell them the importance of being you. You try and tell them the importance of being a certain way. You try and give them the message that a lot of people gave you. Lapin: In 2003, you started Wade's World to help those kids, to talk to those kids. Because you were never talked to when you were growing up. Wade: Yes, yes. I never was. It may have helped me out; helped my drive out. But unfortunately, I've never had anyone come to the community I grew up in and give out that helping hand. And to give us hope, in our community, that we can do something special. I always heard that we couldn't or you know, it's one in a million or something like that. Well, our job and my job at the Wade's World foundation is to go out and let these kids know that we believe in them. And there's more than what you see out your front window or your front door that's in life. And you can do anything you want. Lapin: You said on your bio that you want to leave the world a better place. You think you've done that? Wade: I think I've got a lot more ""doing"" to do. Lapin: What do you want to do? Wade: I think the main thing you think of is to know you can change the whole world, but you can touch many people on the way. And my main thing is like, when I go out and talk to kids or I do different events through my foundation, I just want to change one person's thought in that room. They had a negative thought or belief coming in, I want to make them believe. And if I can change one kid's mind, he can change someone else's mind, and it can be a chain effect that can continue to keep going.","Miami Heat guard Dwyane Wade started foundation to help at-risk kids .

"(CNN) -- The lack of definitive information about the fate of Malaysia Flight 370 has baffled and riveted expert and average person alike. Even the promise of Chinese satellite images capturing the location of crash debris turned out to be false, as Malaysian authorities said a search of the area found nothing. Amid the muddle of speculation, possibilities and blind alleys, are there logical explanations in this mysterious disappearance? The short answer is yes. But what, of what we know so far, makes sense exactly? First, the focus on the airplane's transponders, the device that transmits a discreet signal to Air Traffic Control (ATC) radars, might be misguided. The 777 has two transponders. A failure of one would send a caution message visible to the crew. They would then select the alternate transponder with barely a second thought. A double failure? Not likely, unless there was a serious electronic systems failure (more on that later). The only other plausible explanation would have been that the crew moved the knob to the off position. No professional flight crew would knowingly turn off a transponder in flight. It is also possible the airplane flew out of ATC radar range by navigational error. Or as part of its assigned route, Malaysia 370 might have participated in a well-defined procedure for nonradar environments. Opinion: Conspiracy theories build around disappearance . The North Atlantic track system between North America and Europe is a good example of an area where such a procedure would be used. Airplanes entering the tracks are required to fly at assigned altitudes and air speeds, separated laterally and vertically. Pilots verbally report set latitude and longitude positions on their cleared flight plans to a ground-based service called AIRINC. The nonradar traffic picture is calculated by a computer, based on these position reports. In an airplane as sophisticated as a 777, the on-board computer can generate these reports automatically without verbal communication from the pilots. It is possible that on a portion of Malaysia 370's route, this procedure may have been utilized. If the airplane deviated from its assigned route because of an emergency, no problem would be indicated until the next reporting point because of the lack of ATC radar coverage. The crew would have to communicate the problem to the ground-based facility. The 777 is one of the most advanced electronic airplanes built. Data is constantly being processed and transmitted to regulate internal systems, from flight controls to fuel systems and hundreds more. Much of this data is being transmitted automatically to the airline. This data is used for dispatch computations and maintenance, among other uses. Only a very rare major electrical and electronic failure would prevent this information from being transmitted. Information regarding altitude, airspeed and heading is always available. Any irregularities in just these parameters alone would indicate a problem. Was the airplane descending rapidly? Did the heading change indicate a course reversal? Did the airspeed increase indicate a dive? It's possible Malaysia Airlines experienced a malfunction in the receiving system -- doubtful, but it would help if the airline made that information available. For argument's sake, let's say a major mechanical failure occurred. The crew might have been preoccupied with a serious problem as they progressed through the appropriate electronic checklist. A mayday call might not have been first on their agenda. All pilots are taught to ""aviate, navigate and communicate,"" in that order. Could the mechanical problem have been serious enough for the crew to have lost control of the airplane before a distress signal was sent? Opinion: How did stolen passports get through? Although remote, consider the possibility of a fuel tank explosion. For the flight time to Beijing, the center tank would most likely have been empty except for residual fuel as a matter of 777 procedure. The main wing tanks would have sufficient fuel for the trip. Could a short that caused a spark within a fuel boost pump have ignited the trapped vapor within the center tank? The National Transportation Safety Board attributes the explosion of TWA Flight 800 off Long Island in 1996 to this cause. That accident involved a 747 and not a 777. Boeing recommended both a mechanical and procedural modification for the potential, but not totally verified, problem for many Boeing airplanes. Airlines began the modifications within two years after the investigation was complete. Did Malaysia Airlines comply with the modification? Now that the Chinese satellite image led nowhere, perhaps the rather chaotic search should be conducted over land. A different route may have been chosen if the crew had actually made the decision to return or divert elsewhere. Regardless, a debris field will be found. And if the airplane just fell out of the sky, it didn't happen as a result of only one factor. All accidents involve multiple factors. Let's keep the speculation in perspective. The accident investigation process can be tedious, if not arduous. But the process is well-organized, especially in the United States; the NTSB's participation will be of tremendous assistance. Airplanes don't just disappear. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Les Abend.","Les Abend: The lack of information regarding the fate of Malaysia 370 is baffling .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Samsung Electronics' tablet computer, the Galaxy Tab, will be available to consumers in Australia in the coming days, after the South Korean electronics giant scored a victory against Apple in a legal battle that had blocked the product from going on sale. The Australian High Court denied Apple's appeal to an earlier court ruling that overturned an injunction placed on Samsung's Galaxy Tab 10.1 citing violation of its patent. The recent ruling is expected to give Samsung a stronger footing in a legal battle it is involved in with Apple in several countries across the world, including the United States. Samsung welcomed the court's decision and said the Galaxy Tab 10.1 will be ready for sale in Australia in time for the Christmas shopping season. ""The Full Court of Australia decision on November 30 clearly affirmed our view that Apple's claims lack merit and that an injunction should not have been imposed on the Galaxy Tab 10.1,"" Samsung said in a news release, referring to the earlier ruling that lifted the injunction. Apple claims that Samsung's newer Galaxy Tab 10.1 copies the iPad's look and infringes upon its design patents. ""It's no coincidence that Samsung's latest products look a lot like the iPhone and iPad, from the shape of the hardware to the user interface and even the packaging. This kind of blatant copying is wrong and, as we've said many times before, we need to protect Apple's intellectual property when companies steal our ideas,"" according to a statement from Apple. Apple recently was denied a preliminary injunction on several of Samsung's mobile phones and tablets in America by a San Jose court. The South Korean electronics giant said it is confident that it can prove the distinctiveness of its mobile products when the two companies battle it out in court next year. Samsung separately filed a complaint back in June with the United States International Trade Commission claiming Apple has violated five patents related to wireless communications standards and mobile device user interface. The South Korean company requested a permanent exclusion order that would block the entry of all Apple products in question, including the iPad and iPhone series, into the United States.","The Australian High Court denied Apple's appeal to an earlier court decision .

"(CNN) -- At last the mystery has been solved. Since a fan tweeted a picture of Jerry Seinfeld and Jason Alexander outside Tom's Restaurant, which served as a stand-in Monk's on the hit NBC show ""Seinfeld,"" there has been buzz about what it could mean. Was it a Super Bowl commercial? Something having to do with Seinfeld's Web series ""Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee""? Or was it perhaps, like the sitcom, a whole bunch of nothing? The answer is yes. In addition to the comic, the mini-""Seinfeld"" reunion included Alexander, who played George Costanza on the show, and Wayne Knight, who played Newman the postal carrier. It turned out to be a bit of a commercial for Seinfeld's ""Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee."" On that show, Seinfeld often sits down for a chat with fellow comedians and celebs. In this case, Seinfeld was in character as Seinfeld hanging out with his old buddy Costanza in search of some grub during the Super Bowl. The pair bantered about a friend's Super Bowl party and a discussion ensued about ""over cheering"" football games. Then Jerry's nemesis, Newman, showed up. In all, it really was straightforward. Though keep in mind ""Seinfeld"" celebrates its 25th anniversary this year, so perhaps there is something more to the mystery after all.","Fans had guesses after Seinfeld and Alexander were spotted together .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- In a ruling that human rights groups are calling historic, India's Supreme Court on Tuesday granted the country's transsexual and transgender individuals the right to self-identify their gender. The ruling means transsexual and transgender people and those who identify as belonging to the ""third gender"" will not be required to submit medical evidence of their sexuality to be recognized by the government as a member of that gender, said Tripti Tandon, a lawyer for one of the plaintiffs. A plea was filed before the Supreme Court by India's National Legal Services Authority in 2012 on behalf of the transsexual and ""hijra,"" or third-gender, communities. ""The Supreme Court ruled that everyone has the fundamental right to have their gender identified and recognized in the law without any discrimination,"" Tandon said. ""And it's self-identification of the gender as opposed to medically or surgically assigned one."" The high court also issued a series of guidelines to India's federal government and state administrations for enforcement of its orders, she added. The ruling states that ""gender identity is integral to the dignity of an individual and is at the core of 'personal autonomy' and 'self-determination.'"" Hijras, the ruling said, must be considered a third gender ""over and above binary genders under our Constitution and the laws."" The ruling allows females to identify as males and males to identify as females, and no sex reassignment surgery is required for recognition of one's self-defined gender. Human rights groups praised the ruling, but used the opportunity to push for changes in another law that criminalizes consensual homosexual relationships. Tuesday's ruling has the potential to alter the lives of people who have suffered oppression, Amnesty International's program director in India, Shashikumar Velath, said in a statement. But, he noted, the same Supreme Court has overturned a lower court's decision to decriminalize homosexual relationships. The law bans people from engaging in ""carnal acts against the order of nature"" and dates back to British colonial times. The court's ruling on transgender, transsexual and third-gender people recognizes that their plight cannot be ignored, said Graeme Reid, director of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Rights Program at Human Rights Watch. ""It begins the process of re-establishing the important social role that third-gender people played in traditional Indian society,"" he said. CNN's Tara Kangarlou contributed to this report.","India's Supreme Court says people have the right to self-identify their gender .
Human rights groups say it is a victory for transgender and transsexual community .

"(CNN) -- Virginia prosecutors said Monday they will not pursue murder charges against three people in connection with the death of Kevin Quick, an auxiliary police officer. Leslie Hope Casterlow, 49; Anthony Darnell Stokes Jr., 31; and Halisi Uhuru still face felony gang participation charges, Goochland County Commonwealth's Attorney Claiborne Stokes' office said. Authorities didn't say why the murder prosecution won't be pursued. Quick, 45, was an auxiliary police captain and resident of Waynesboro, a small town west of Charlottesville. Auxiliary officers aren't paid but hold ranks, have badges and carry firearms like full-time officers. He was last seen the night of January 31 after he left the house he shared with his mother. His remains were found last Thursday. Authorities have not revealed the cause of death or explained any connection between Quick and the suspects. Two other suspects arrested last Tuesday, siblings Daniel Mathis and Mersadies Shelton, are held each on charges of felony grand theft for allegedly stealing Quick's vehicle, a 1999 Toyota 4Runner. They are not being charged in connection with Quick's death. Another man, Anthony Lee White, 22, was arrested after the others were already in custody, and White also will face gang participation charges, Stokes' office said.","Gang participation charges will be pursued against suspects .

"(CNN) -- Thai police detained hundreds of Muslim Rohingya following a raid on a suspected people-trafficking camp, police said. A Royal Thai Police spokesman said 531 men, women and children were detained following a raid on Sunday at a camp near the town of Sadao in the southern province of Songkhla. Police said they were acting on media reports that Rohingya fleeing sectarian violence in Myanmar were falling into the hands of people smugglers who held them in camps, ransoming them to relatives across the border in Malaysia. Deputy National Police Chief Chatchawan Suksomjit told the South China Morning Post that three suspected ringleaders -- all of them Thai males -- had been detained in the raid. He said the Rohingyas were being held at an immigration detention center in Songkhla. ""We are interviewing all of them to see if they are victims of human trafficking,"" he said. ""We have to interview them and proceed according to Thai immigration laws. It will depend on whether they want to go back. ""If they are willing, we will send them back as we have done before."" Rohingyas -- stateless Muslims from Myanmar -- have been fleeing ethnic violence in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, arriving in boats in southwestern Thailand before transiting to Malaysia where they often work illegally. Thailand's efforts to deport Rohingya -- in some cases allegedly towing their boats back out to sea -- has come under fire from human rights groups as well as the U.S. State Department. Phil Robertson, deputy director at Human Rights Watch, said that human trafficking had been ""plaguing efforts to help the Rohingya for the last year or two at least."" ""When the Rohingya boats started coming out in significant numbers circa 2009, it was very disorganized, boats were landing everywhere -- this is when the Thais were pushing them out to sea. ""But now these Rohingyas that are arriving close to the Thai coast are being seized by broker and trafficking syndicates working in collusion with Thai officials to bring these people onshore, hold them in jungle camps and then essentially ransoming them."" He said in some cases ransom money could be as much 65-70,000 Thai baht (US$2000) -- which represented a considerable amount of money for some of the world's poorest people. ""There's been a long-standing Rohingya community in Malaysia -- they have relative and friends there, there are jobs on offer."" He said that once in Malaysia, Rohingya often worked in the black economy doing dirty and dangerous jobs. ""That's where the Rohingya are headed to, that's their promised land in some ways."" Sunai Phasuk, Thailand-Burma researcher for Human Rights Watch, said that the Rohingya had the ""unenviable distinction of being the most blighted"" people in Myanmar. ""Denied citizenship, subject to tight restrictions on movement, employment and religious freedoms, this Muslim minority have been the target of abuses by the Burmese military for decades,"" he said. ""Today they face serious risks of state violence and coercion, in part arising from preparations to build a pipeline through their region that will deliver offshore gas to China. Already reports are emerging of forced relocations and other abuses tied to gas exploitation.""","Thai police detain 531 Muslim Rohingya being held in a camp near the Malaysian border .

"Waukesha, Wisconsin (CNN) -- Approval ratings -- and the events that led to the most difficult political year of his presidency -- mean very little to President Barack Obama's daughters. They are more concerned, he said, with their teenage pursuits. ""When we sit down at the dinner table, they have some awareness of what's going on. And we have great conversations although mostly it's about history more than about what's going on right now,"" Obama told CNN in an exclusive interview airing Friday. ""But it's true. Look, they're teenagers. They're fully absorbed with their lives, what's going on at school."" Still, the girls have managed to meet a great number of people who will have a place in history. That includes the former Pope, Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI. It was Obama's first year in office, when he took his daughters -- Sasha and Malia -- with him to the Vatican. ""Sasha was still pretty young at the time,"" Obama said. ""...They see the Sistine Chapel, and they're going through the various chambers. Each time she'd see somebody dressed up in the cloth, she'd say 'Is that the pope? Is that the pope?' How 'bout that guy over there?'"" His answer: ""No, no, you'll know when it is finally the Pope."" Obama doesn't know if the girls will be with him when he meets the new leader of the Catholic Church, Pope Francis, later this year. ""I have been really impressed so far with the way he has communicated what I think is the essence of the Christian faith, and that is a true sense of brotherhood and sisterhood and a true sense of regard for those who are less fortunate,"" Obama said. Asked if he might have some advice for the Pope on setting expectations a little lower, the president laughed. ""My suspicion is based on what I've seen of him so far, he's a pretty steady guy. I don't think he needs any advice from me on staying humble."" Pope Francis may not need any help with that from the President, but Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman might. Sherman's rant following the Seahawks' win over the San Francisco 49ers, a game that earned him a spot in the Super Bowl, caused a brouhaha after he declared he was the best. He was ultimately fined more than $7,800 for unsportsmanlike conduct after he made a choking sign at 49er quarterback Colin Kaepernick. ""My sense is he's taking a page out of Muhammad Ali's playbook, which is, I think he said explicitly, this is a good way to get attention. In fact, Ali said he got his schtick from wrestlers he used to watch,"" Obama said. ""...So I think it's part of the tradition 'let me get some attention.' Obviously, it's worked. I suspect he's going to have a lot more endorsement contracts and more jersey sales after that."" CNN gave the President two options of competitions that we wanted him to weigh in on: Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton vs. Vice President Joe Biden for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination or the Seattle Seahawks vs. the Denver Broncos in Sunday's Super Bowl. ""I think it's going to be a lot like the Seahawks-49ers game. I think it's going to come down to the last play,"" Obama said. ""...I'm not going to pick because I don't want to offend any of the great cities participating."" OK, so if he's not going to pick in the Super Bowl than what about Clinton versus Biden? ""I'm too smart for that,"" the President said. Jake Tapper reported from Waukesha, Wisconsin; and Chelsea J. Carter wrote from Atlanta. Watch The Lead with Jake Tapper weekdays at 4pm ET.

"(CNN) -- Before Christianity and Islam became the dominant religions of the island of Borneo, Animist beliefs dictated that when a person died, their spirit rose to the peak of Mount Kinabalu. At 4,095 meters above sea level, it's one of the highest mountains in Southeast Asia. Today, UNESCO-listed Mount Kinabalu National Park is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the state of Sabah, in Malaysian Borneo, with visitors forced to book two to three months in advance to secure one of 196 daily allocated hiking permits. Though Sabah is developing at pace, villagers living at the foothills of Mount Kinabalu continue to perform Animist rituals to appease spirits residing at the cloud-ringed peak so no harm comes to those who scale it. The above images were taken on the rock-strewn 8.7-kilometer trail to the summit with Evan Conrad, a guide with Amazing Borneo Tours who first climbed Mount Kinabalu 20 years ago. ""I've climbed the mountains maybe 100 times,"" Conrad said. ""But I never get bored of it. Every time I see something new that excites me, and the view at sunrise is never, ever the same."" More information is available from the Mount Kinabalu Official Climb & Booking Information Centre, which says March to August are the best months to visit as it's the dry season. There are multiple options for those wanting to hit the summit, ranging from from one-day to two-night climbs. The pros recommend beginners do the three-day, two-night option. It allows them to acclimatize to the altitude. Only the super fit should try to get to the summit in a day. Guides and permits are required by law. Getting there . From Malaysia's capital, Kuala Lumpur, a number of flights to Sabah capital Kota Kinabalu are available. The flight time is about two and a half hours.

"(CNN) -- When J.R. Martinez returned from serving in Iraq, he never thought he'd see his name on the marquee at the local restaurant -- but there it was, a welcome-home banner at the Applebee's in Dalton, Georgia. More than 40 percent of J.R. Martinez's body was burned in a land mine explosion in Iraq. He certainly never imagined he'd be starring in a popular daytime soap opera, either. But Martinez, 25, has never let the severe burns he received while serving in the United States Army stop him. He spoke with CNN's Nicole Lapin about overcoming odds and being an inspiration for young people.  Watch Nicole Lapin interview J.R. Martinez » . The following is an edited transcript of the interview. Nicole Lapin: You told your mom you'd come back in one piece. You're obviously back in one piece. You came back burned. What happened? J.R. Martinez: Well, April 5, 2003, I was driving a Humvee through a city called Karbala in Iraq. My job in the military -- in the Army -- was infantry, and as we were driving, my front left tire hit a land mine and I was trapped inside the vehicle. The other three guys, the other three soldiers walked away with minor injuries, which I'm thankful for every single day. I was trapped inside the vehicle for about ten minutes, conscious and can literally see my life slipping away from me. You know, my mother is my best friend and I kind of had the visual of my mother, and them handing her a flag and I thought to myself, that's not something I want to put my mother through. So it's one of those things where we don't know how strong we are until we're faced with things in life and I got through it. Lapin: You did. [A viewer] has a question for you about what kept you going. She says, ""First of all, I want to sincerely say thank you for defending our freedom. My question is, during the time of the explosion, how did you keep yourself going?"" Martinez: Well, when I was a young child, one of my sisters passed away from an illness she was born with. She was born in Central America and I was born here in the United States and I never met her, but I always felt the connection throughout my whole childhood. I felt the connection with my sister and I was confused as to why. And the day of my injury when I was inside the vehicle and I can literally see my life slipping away, an actual visual of my sister came to me and told me I was going to be OK and told me I'd be fine. And after that sweet whisper went away, they pulled me out of the vehicle and got me immediately into the medical team's hands. So I guess you could say faith, my sister, my mother -- all the things that kind of kept me grounded as a young child that my mother instilled in me at a young age: to be strong and to hold on to certain things in life because they'll get you through. Like I said, it's something that's hard to explain, but I know a lot of guys that have been injured in the military or people that have been injured outside the military in the civilian world. And I am just like, ""How did you make it?"" It's just like, we don't know, we just hang in there. Lapin: You just do it. Martinez: Yeah, you just do it. All of us had it inside us. We just don't know it until we're faced with it and that's when the true strength really shows. Lapin: Well, you went through 32 surgeries over 34 months. Was there ever a time where you said, ""Woe is me""? Martinez: Yeah, I'm definitely human and there are a lot of bad days. Even being in the soap opera world, there are still days where you wake up and you're like, ""Here we go again."" Another obstacle [is] where I have to go into the public and show my face and catch those looks of people here in New York. It's one of those things where you've just got to get through it, and you've got to fight the obstacles and you've got to be strong and you say, ""You know what? I have hope and I believe and I'm never going to quit."" And if you do those things, you'll be surprised where your life can take you because, as I said in one of the interviews I did, only in America where this can happen, you can go from losing your life to now being on a soap opera. Lapin: We're looking at a picture of you in a soap opera right now, ""All My Children."" J.R., sitting in that hospital bed watching soap operas with your mother, did you ever think you'd actually be in one? Martinez: You know, it's funny. You've got to be careful what you wish for in life. When I was in the hospital I couldn't move. I couldn't do anything. I was basically at the hands of medical staff and my mother, and every night my mother would watch novela, the Spanish soap opera. And there wasn't nothing I could do about it. So I just sat there. And finally I just got to a point where I'm just going to take it in and watch TV with her. And one day out of a joke I said, ""One day I'm going to be on a soap opera, mom."" All through my recovery I started to do motivational speaking. I became a spokesman for a non-profit called the Coalition to Salute America's Heroes, which helps wounded troops who return from Iraq and Afghanistan. And I always thought to myself, ""In the midst of all this, I would maybe love to touch that world some day, just to kind of play with it for a little bit."" And here I am. Lapin: So you had a little premonition. Martinez: Yeah, so you've got to be careful what you wish for in life because you never know what can happen. Now, in the role in ""All My Children,"" it's a veteran who falls in love and because of his disfigurement, he doesn't know if that person is going to accept him. He kind of feels that it's best for her to move on with her life and not to be a part of his and his struggle. Lapin: [Another viewer] has a question. He wants to know, ""Your story is amazing. I wanted to ask you if it has been tough to relive the terrible pain of your real life during your filming of 'All My Children'?"" Martinez: A lot of us, we go through things in life sometimes and we don't want to sit there and go back to remember it, but it's good to go back and remember it and it's good to talk about it, whether it's to yourself or a piece of paper or whether it's to an audience or a camera like I am doing right now.","J.R.

"(CNN) -- Five of seven Japanese women who disappeared during a diving excursion off the Indonesian island of Bali last week were found alive and rescued Monday, Bali's search and rescue agency said. Mission Coordinator Didi Hamzah confirmed Tuesday night that they had recovered the body of one of the divers. The body was found floating at 610pm local time near Serangan Island. It was retrieved at 635pm and brought to the Bali Sangla hospital for identification. Photos distributed by Getty Images showed the survivors being transferred from a boat to ambulances on Bali on Monday, three days after they were reported missing. The women were being treated at two Bali hospitals Monday, the rescue agency said. Fishermen found four of the women Monday afternoon and alerted authorities, and a rescue boat was sent for them. A fifth survivor was later found in the same area, and a search and rescue helicopter picked her up, the rescue agency said. Search and Rescue agency official Gede Surya told CNN that the five divers were found just south of Nusa Penida island. Four of them were grouped together on some rocks and the fifth was found nearby. ""They were dehydrated and in shock but they could still speak and walk,"" he said. The body of a sixth diver was found Tuesday, and the search continues for the sole missing woman, authorities said. Japanese media reported that the woman rescued separately was instructor Saori Furukawa, who had left the group on Sunday in an attempt to hail the fishing boat for rescue. Four of the rescued divers were taken to Sangla hospital in Bali, where psychologist Retno Kusuma told CNN they are in the same hospital room and are in ""good condition mentally [and] psychologically."" She said that the group were laughing and joking, and that they will be assessed again in a few days but are currently only being treated for light burns. The seven Japanese women -- two dive instructors and five tourists -- failed to return to the surface Friday after a dive near the Indonesian islands of Nusa Lembongan and Nusa Penida, just southeast of Bali. The owner of the Bali dive company Yellow Scuba told CNN that the captain who accompanied the seven hired a Yellow Scuba boat but did not work for the company. The captain, in a written statement given to police and published in local news reports, said the weather was good when the divers entered the water. ""But about 15 minutes later, it was cloudy. I tried to find them but my efforts produced no results,"" the captain's statement reads. Heavy rains were reported in the area Friday. The period from October to April is monsoon season in Bali, which sees strong winds and bursts of heavy rain.

"Dubai (CNN) -- A land of superlatives. The world's tallest tower, the longest driverless public transit network, the largest illuminated advertising sign, to name a few. Now Dubai, one of seven emirates making up the United Arab Emirates, is home to another record: the tallest twisted structure in the world. Cayan Tower, which spirals at 90 degrees from the bottom to the top, was inaugurated on Monday with a spectacular firework display as it stands in the Dubai Marina, a man-made harbour. The 1 billion dirham ($272 million) residential tower has 75 floors housing 495 apartments. Developer, Cayan Real Estate Investment and Development Company, says 80% of the units have already been sold. On a secondary market property website, a one-bedroom apartment carries a price tag of $435,000. The structure stands at 307 meters high with each floor rotated by 1.2 degrees. Construction on Cayan Tower, previously known as Infiniti Tower, started in 2006 but soon after that a major flooding in the basement caused a delay. The tower was set to finish in 2010 but then faced another hurdle, the financial crisis in 2009. The credit crunch forced many projects in the city to be put on hold or be scrapped altogether. Dubai, whose economy relies heavily on real estate, saw property prices slump as much as 60% during that time. But a recovery is well underway in the Emirate. Analysts at property consultant, Jones Lang LaSalle, say real estate investment in the first quarter of the year has been ""very active"". Sale and rental prices continue to rise, building on the strong growth of 2012.","The tallest twisted structure in the world was inaugurated on Monday in Dubai .

"Kano, Nigeria (CNN) -- Residents of Kano in Nigeria are struggling to keep alive their centuries-old tradition of hand-dying delicate cloth a deep indigo blue, with their trade under threat from the realities of modern commerce. Kano's pits are said to date back 500 years and were once the center of a bustling Saharan trade in dyed cloth. There are still over 120 pits in Kano but only 30 of them are functioning. Many of them have been filled in, often because families have moved on to other businesses, but sometimes because they're waiting for their children to grown up, dig out the pit and reclaim their tradition. Sixty-five-year-old Yusuf Abdu has worked in the dye pits since he was a boy. The pits are family owned and Abdu has trained his 21-year-old son to continue the tradition, but such dedication is rare. ""A lot of our elders have died, so we are calling our families to come back and embrace the work again,"" said Abdu, who is hoping his son will pass on the knowledge to another generation. Indigo, potassium and ash are mixed with water in the pits, and then the cloth soaked for up to six hours. The longer it's soaked, the deeper the color. ""We are using the same ways dyers used when the pits began in 1498,"" explained Abdu. ""We cannot use modern methods because that will change our tradition."" Methods of ironing the cloth are just as traditional; material is beaten with a mallet to remove creases. But these ancient production lines are now being hammered by competition from cheaper foreign fabrics and the rising costs of energy and materials at home. ""There have been a lot of changes. Materials that once cost $10 now cost $40,"" said Abdu. Despite its rich history, regional demand for the dyed wares has fallen as fashions have changed, so the dyers are looking to tourists as potential buyers. Abdu hopes that with their custom the dye trade will continue, as it has for centuries, and that one day his son will be passing on the traditional techniques to his grandson.","Kano is said to be home to the oldest dye pits in Africa, dating back to 1498 .

"(CNN) -- Megaupload, the file-sharing website shut down Thursday by the U.S. federal government, is a Web hosting tool that now finds itself accused of being an online haven for digital pirates. Many people probably never have heard of the site. But to millions, the 6-year-old site, based in Hong Kong, was a fast, easy way to store massive files in a ""locker"" online and then share them with friends or colleagues. At various points in its history, Megaupload has been among the most popular websites in the world. And it once had the support of some celebrities. A (really bizarre) YouTube video shows Kanye West, Kim Kardashian, P. Diddy and several other celebrities vouching for the site in an apparent music video-style advertisement. But the site has long suffered accusations of allowing less-than-legal files to pass through its computer servers. ""Megaupload was always going to get taken down -- far too flagrant publication of copyrighted material,"" Jonathan Riggall, a website editor living in Barcelona, Spain, wrote on TorrentFreak, a blog devoted to file-sharing issues. ""I think sharing on the Web is great, and I don't care if it's copyrighted material -- but Megaupload and some similar sites are making loads of money out of making it possible for people to view pirated stuff. Of course they will be targeted as they are blatantly breaking laws."" The U.S. attorney for Megaupload.com denies the government's allegations. 'We believe that the allegations are without merit and Megaupload is going to vigorously defend against the case,"" attorney Ira Rothken said. Created in 2005, Megaupload was the 72nd-most-visited site on the Web during the past three months and has peaked as high as No. 13, according to Internet traffic analytics firm Alexa. The site offered what's called ""one-click hosting,"" letting users upload anything on their hard drive or in cloud storage to the Web. The service gives users a URL that can then be shared with others -- often on discreet online message boards or social networks -- letting them access the file as well. MegaVideo was the site's video service, letting even nonmembers view more than an hour of video at a time on the site, and MegaPix was a photo storage and sharing site in the mold of Flickr or Photobucket. People who paid for a premium account on the site were able to upload and download larger files. It was, by all accounts, a successful business model. The U.S. government said that it seized $50 million in assets and that much of the $175 million the site has earned since 2005 was due to copyright infringement. As Ars Technica notes, even the site's graphic designer reportedly earned $1 million last year, and between them, the seven indicted people (including the creatively named Kim Dotcom) owned 15 Mercedes-Benzes, a Maserati, a Rolls-Royce and a Lamborghini. The blog TechCrunch has posted photos of seized assets, including the cars and a large house in New Zealand, in case you're interested. Publicly, at least, the site frowned on illegal uploads. It featured a tool to report ""abuse,"" gave copyright holders the ability to hunt for illegal content and registered with the U.S. government under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, a law aimed at fighting piracy. The site's owners have denied any wrongdoing in regard to copyright violation, and their attorney has said the site was wrongly shut down before its owners were allowed to address the charges against them. But the Justice Department says the anti-theft efforts were a facade -- that Megaupload's employees knew they were enabling piracy and made the site difficult for outsiders to search for illegal material. In an unofficial sampling of CNN Tech readers on Twitter, many quickly acknowledged using the site to watch TV shows or movies. But others cited more legitimate uses, with some saying they've lost legitimate content, not to mention money, after the government crackdown. Seng Ung of Boston said he recently paid roughly $260 for a lifetime membership so he could store old files from childhood and college. He didn't lose them, but now he's gotten nothing in return for his payment, he said. Developers of open-source Linux and Homebrew software said they used it to upload projects they were working on together. Musicians, as well, said they stored songs for collaborative projects there. One user said she used it for sharing large zip files of photographs that were too unwieldy to send via e-mail. ""Megaupload was closed by the FBI ... was I the only ones who had it for work files?"" Twitter user Nina Andrade wrote. ""Just get me my files back!!!"" The charges come at a time when online piracy is a hot topic. New legislation before the U.S. Congress -- which would have cracked down on piracy but, according to critics, would also have endangered free speech online -- has stalled at least temporarily after a massive online protest this week. (Full disclosure: CNN's parent company, Time Warner, supports that anti-piracy legislation.) Some people online say the Megaupload takedown, which came a day after Wikipedia and other sites went black in protest of the pending legislation, was largely symbolic -- singling out one site while bigger ones still thrive. With a couple of quick clicks on a pair of well-known file-sharing sites on Friday, CNN was able to see that Metallica's entire discography, every ""Doctor Who"" episode for the past six seasons and Steven Spielberg's epic ""War Horse,"" which is currently playing in theaters, were offered up for download by anyone seeking out those files.","The U.S. government shut down file-sharing site Megaupload on Thursday .

"(CNN) -- While airports across the southeastern United States continued to dig out from Tuesday's snowstorm, Wednesday turned into a long day of cancellations and delays for frustrated travelers. Airlines had canceled more than 2,200 U.S. flights by Wednesday at 5 p.m. ET according to flight tracking site FlightAware.com. That follows about 3,200 flight cancellations on Tuesday. The airport most affected was Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International, the world's busiest, with more than 1,000 flights canceled, according to FlightAware.com. Delta Air Lines, which is based in Atlanta, was affected most. ""This spate of winter weather has hit a lot of airports that usually don't face winter weather and are less prepared for it,"" Mark Duell, FlightAware's vice president of operations, said via e-mail. ""When every flight needs de-icing, (those airports) see a massive slowdown in departures, and the airlines pre-emptively cancel flights."" Many airports struggled all day to return to normal operations. Flights arriving in Atlanta were facing delays of more than five hours as of 5 p.m. ET, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. That's because Delta requested a ground stop, driven by the weather and airport access difficulty, which was later converted into a ground delay program, spokesman Morgan Durrant said via e-mail. ""This means that flights bound to ATL from other airports are seeing delays."" Check fly.faa.gov for the most current information on delays. With more than 900 Atlanta flights canceled Tuesday, some passengers intending to depart Atlanta stayed at the airport overnight, airport spokesman Reese McCranie said. On Wednesday by 5 p.m. ET, airlines had canceled more than 1,000 flights departing from or arriving at the Atlanta airport, according to FlightAware.com. Delta reported about 1,200 cancellations systemwide by 3:30 p.m. on Wednesday, on top of 1,200 Tuesday cancellations, said Delta's Durrant. And the airline is still facing challenges getting employees to work at its Atlanta hub, he said. ""Last night, we did allow airport employees to sleep aboard aircraft parked at gates and we flew an extra section (unscheduled flight) full of pilots and flight attendants to Louisville so they could be afforded rest in hotel rooms,"" Durrant said via e-mail. ""This group was scheduled to have hotel stays near ATL as part of their regularly scheduled trips."" Alabama's Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport shut down flight operations Tuesday afternoon as the snowfall began, and ""crews worked overnight and continue to work this morning to clear the (two) runways,"" wrote airport spokeswoman Toni Herrera-Bast. One runway had reopened by midday Wednesday. Southwest Airlines and AirTran canceled more than 300 of 3,600 scheduled flights Wednesday. The combined airline canceled nearly 400 flights Tuesday. ""Our people in Atlanta, in particular, are facing a challenging day,"" said Southwest spokesman Brad Hawkins via e-mail Wednesday morning. ""What you're seeing there in Atlanta is a continuing operation but an extremely slow operation, resulting in just a few departures every hour."" U.S. Airways, which merged with American but still operates separate flights, canceled more than 200 flights Wednesday, on top of 300 cancellations Tuesday, said spokesman Davien Anderson. While the Charlotte, North Carolina, airport reported no major delays in arrivals or departures Wednesday, with all runways free of ice and snow, U.S. Airways was still hit hard. ""Our employees are working hard to get operations back to normal in Charlotte,"" Anderson said via e-mail. ""We hope to return to normal operations by tomorrow."" CNN's Etan Horowitz reported from Tampa, Florida.","Airports have cleared runways, but airlines have a backlog .

"(CNN) -- A few weeks ago Col. Lawrence Sellin, a Special Forces officer stationed in Afghanistan, fell victim to a particularly modern hazard of war: PowerPoint fatigue. Col. Sellin was fired from his post at NATO's International Security Assistance Force after he wrote an essay for the UPI wire service in which he voiced his frustration about PowerPoint-obsessed officers who spend more time worrying about font size and bullet points than actual bullets. Col. Sellin's was just the latest in a series of complaints about the military use of slide presentations -- you may recall public ridicule of the famously incomprehensible ""spaghetti slide,"" and a recent New York Times article, that cited other officers just as frustrated with the emergence of the military bureaucracy's ""PowerPoint rangers."" But PowerPoint isn't inherently bad -- just misunderstood. And bad PowerPoint presentations aren't just a concern of the military. We've all sat through presentations -- or suffered or even dozed through them. The truth is, most are poorly constructed and instantly forgettable. Why does this matter? Because presentations decide elections, military strategies and multibillion-dollar business deals; they educate our children and they spread the ideas that shape society's most important goals and directives. Ultimately, a presentation succeeds or fails on the strength of its message and how well it's told. And those elements have nothing to do with the brand of the software package involved in its production. You know instantly when you're watching a great presenter at work -- you may even own the ShamWow to prove it. Sometimes, presenters try to punch up weak content with stunts. I remember one speaker who rode onto the stage on a motorcycle -- and promptly lost control and crashed. (He was okay.) Another presenter rappelled down to the stage like a mountain climber. I remember the stunts, but not the messages. Poor presentations can have disastrous consequences. Edward Tufte, perhaps the most important writer on the display of information, demonstrated how the disintegration of the space shuttle Columbia in 2003 might have been averted by a more objective presentation of the damage inflicted on Columbia's wing by a piece of foam debris during takeoff. As it was, Tufte wrote in his article, ""PowerPoint Does Rocket Science: Assessing the Quality and Credibility of Technical Reports,"" NASA officials came away from PowerPoint-driven briefings by Boeing engineers with an overly optimistic view of the situation, in part as a result of hard-to-understand slides overloaded with bullet points. In other words, a bad presentation may have caused that disaster, and a good one might have prevented it. Of course, we can't be naive: a persuasive presentation isn't necessarily a good presentation. In 2001, Enron Corp. executives Ken Lay, Jeff Skilling and Richard Causey presented PowerPoint slides at an employee meeting that winningly depicted the company's robust health and the bright future of its projected earnings. By the end of that year the company was worthless. Eventually, the U.S. Department of Justice charged those executives with 10 counts of a variety of crimes -- based on their presentations. Meanwhile, the Enron scandal may have been preventable by the right presentation. In 1999, a presentation by the Arthur Andersen accounting firm feebly warned the Enron Board of Director's audit committee of the company's sketchy accounting. Had that presentation sounded a bold warning, the audit committee might have been able to save the company. For that matter, it might have saved Andersen, which did not recover from its role in Enron's dealings. Unfortunately, the development of presentations is a skill that is rarely taught and for which few sources of best practices exist. Bad presentations kill ideas, waste money and impede progress. Great ones illuminate, persuade, generate consensus and spark action. How do you create a great presentation? I've been in the business for 20 years, but until recently even I couldn't define the deep structures and elements of truly superior presentations. My research into this question led me in unexpected directions. The answers I found had nothing to do with technology or the internet; they were revealed in screenwriting, Greek and Shakespearean drama, mythology and literature. Great presenters employ the basic narrative techniques used throughout history to connect with audiences and move them to action and new understanding. The presentations that work are not the ones with the most data or the most elaborate charts and graphs; the winners are those with the most compelling and convincing narratives. We're a distracted, multi-tasking society. So presentations need to lure and re-lure an audience simply to keep their attention. Audiences are looking at the clock or fiddling with their handheld devices throughout a presentation. You don't connect with your audience by throwing information at them -- you do it by taking them on a journey toward your perspective. Whether you're a CEO, a salesperson, a general or a biochemist, you must understand how to connect with an audience, how to construct a powerful narrative argument, and how to visually display information for maximum audience comprehension. I read recently that our nation is suffering a crisis of literacy, with only 35% percent of high school seniors able to read proficiently. Yes, you read that correctly (assuming you're not part of the 65% of high school seniors.) But literacy really means the ability to communicate effectively. For professionals and citizens in every strata of society, true literacy now includes the ability to communicate effectively through presentations. The stakes could not be higher for our country. If corporate executives communicate poorly, businesses and the economy suffer, and jobs are lost. If teachers communicate poorly, our children don't learn and advance. If generals communicate poorly, our troops and their missions are put at risk. These are dangers we cannot ignore.

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Calling the latest battle over the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s possessions a ""spiritually violent"" moment in her family's history, the civil rights icon's sole surviving daughter said Thursday she already had won the ""moral high ground,"" regardless of a court's decision. At issue are her father's 1964 Nobel Peace Prize and traveling Bible, used to swear in President Barack Obama for his second term. Bernice King declined to hand the items over on Wednesday, as mandated in a February court order. She has previously said her brothers would sell the items if she gave them up. The Fulton County Superior Court in Georgia extended the deadline for King to produce the items until Monday, saying it would hold them in a safe-deposit box until the litigation between King and her brothers is settled. ""I must say it is deep-in-my-soul difficult to place my father's prized, precious heirlooms under the custody of the state, even if only for a season,"" she told supporters who gathered at Atlanta's historic Ebenezer Baptist Church. ""Yet I recognize that justice and righteousness are not always aligned,"" she continued, ""and there's often a disconnect between God's law and man's law. As dad said, 'We must accept finite disappointment but never lose infinite hope.' "" King said she ""was led by the Holy Spirit to comply"" with the new Monday deadline. King further told the assembled crowd, made up of supporters and civil rights activists, that the public tug-of-war was a ""defining moment for our family"" and ""an embarrassing chapter in our family's history."" She pleaded with her brothers, who were not in attendance, and any prospective buyers to ""step up to reason and do what your consciousness says is right."" According to an affidavit filed in the lawsuit, King wrote an e-mail to her brother Dexter in 2007, saying she was OK with selling some of her father's possessions. She now says the Bible and Nobel Prize are too sacred to part with. Emphasizing her deep love for her brothers, Bernice King said she'd ask them to reconsider their stance on the heirlooms and noted that only one brother would need to agree to keep the items in the family. However, Bernice King told CNN she did not foresee her and her brothers reaching any middle ground. She has not spoken to them in some time, she said. CNN's attempts to reach the attorney for the Martin Luther King Estate were not immediately successful. The three King siblings make up the surviving board of the estate. They took a vote before the lawsuit over whether to sell the items, which Bernice King lost 1-2. The King brothers say that the future of the estate would be threatened if a sale could not be made. No prospective buyers or dollar amount have been publicly disclosed. Bernice King says she wants to keep the items for reasons other than money. ""If it was about money, hey, I should have just been quiet and took my cut from the sale of these items, but I try to live my life on principle."" The case is scheduled to be heard September 29.","Bernice King says it's ""deep-in-my-soul difficult"" to hand over precious heirlooms .

"(CNN) -- Sometimes, the crash site is never found. In 1972 a Pan Alaska Airways flight with one pilot and three passengers took off from Anchorage bound for Juneau, planning to fly the route under visual flight rules despite bad weather conditions. After one last contact with air traffic controllers, the Cessna was on its way. The plane never reached Juneau. The flight had two congressmen on board -- Hale Boggs of Louisiana and Nicholas Begich of Alaska. The search for the missing aircraft was intense, encompassing 325,000 square miles of land and sea, with 3,600 flight hours used to look for the wreckage. But after 39 days, the search was called off. A National Transportation Safety Board report acknowledged that the cause might never be known. In the case of Malaysia Flight 370, a Boeing 777 missing since Saturday, a search of an area captured by Chinese satellite images that seemed to pinpoint the crash site turned up nothing. Such images are rare, and typically, when a plane goes down in a remote area with no witnesses, one of the most crucial tools available to investigators is radar. ""It's very important,"" said John Griffin II, an associate professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University who specializes in air traffic control. ""There are basically two ways to find a plane -- radar and pilot communication."" Radar can take two forms. One is primary radar, what's sometimes called ""skinpaint,"" that simply reflects off an object. Primary radar doesn't give any information about the object it's tracking. ""If you work at an ATC (Air Traffic Control) facility on an East Coast flyway, you will pick up flocks of birds,"" Griffin said. Primary radar can also pick up debris that might be raining down from an in-flight explosion, and in such cases a target that appears as one object suddenly appears as several objects. Secondary radar, on the other hand, relies on plane's transponder, a device located in the nose of the plane. The transponder broadcasts a signal to air traffic controllers that identifies the flight and its altitude. Secondary radar is more than just a blip on a radar screen; it tells the controllers the valuable information about the specific aircraft. Malaysia Flight 370's transponder stopped broadcasting about 45 minutes into the flight. At that point, air traffic controllers in Kuala Lampur had no more contact with the aircraft. At first, the search area focused on the plane's intended flight path, as officials went on the assumption that the plane did not change course. ""Then they started exploring other possibilities,"" Griffin said. Military radar tracked unidentified targets that could have been Flight 370 heading west toward the Strait of Malacca and possibly beyond. Military radar can cover areas not covered by civilian air traffic control. But without the plane's transponder working, that target tracked by radar is only ""skinpaint,"" or the reflection of a dense object. It can't identify the plane or give an altitude. And even the radar can only provide so much information. It's possible for a plane to literally fly under the radar because coverage usually doesn't go all the way down to the surface. In that case, a plane could continue undetected even in areas covered by radar. In addition to the 1972 Alaska crash, other aircraft have gone missing without a trace. In 1962, a Flying Tiger Line Lockheed Constellation operating as a military transport disappeared over the Pacific after taking off from Guam. The recovery operation included 48 aircraft, but no sign of the plane was ever found. Officials deny Malaysia Airlines jet kept flying for hours . In the case of the Malaysia Airlines flight, the search area has continued to expand rather than contract -- something that experts say does not bode well for the likelihood of finding the plane. On Wednesday, Malaysian authorities broadened the search area to 27,000 nautical square miles, nearly doubling its size. On Thursday, authorities said they planned to look farther west toward the Indian Ocean. It's almost impossible to simply crisscross such a large area in low-flying planes and boats. ""It's a monumental task,"" Griffin said. ""It's a vast area. There's a lot of terrain there, remote areas where the plane could have crashed."" After the Alaska crash, Congress mandated that general aviation aircraft carry an ELT, or emergency locator transmitter. The ELT is designed to activate during a crash and broadcast a signal to an emergency frequency monitored by air traffic controllers. International civil aviation authorities require that international flights, such as the Kuala Lumpur-Beijing flight, have ELTs on board. It's not clear, however, if the Malaysia Airlines plane had the device on board. If it did have an ELT, it hasn't been detected -- and that could mean that the plane crashed in such a remote location that its signal is out of range, or that the device malfunctioned or didn't go off because the plane actually landed somewhere safely. ""But then you get into how do you hide a 777,"" Griffin said. ""This is a serious aircraft."" Seriously big. The Boeing 777's tail alone stands 60 feet high. But right now, it's a 200-foot-long, 500,000-pound needle in a haystack that could be as large as an ocean. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sylvia Adcock.","Sylvia Adcock says there have been previous flights that vanished and were never found .

"Port-Au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Vladimir Saint-Louis is glad to be back in business months after January's devastating earthquake in Haiti shut down his large athletic complex in the heart of Port-au-Prince. Although he was unharmed, his father nearly lost his life when cement blocks fell on his car, injuring and trapping him for hours. On this particular afternoon six months after the quake, customers worked out at Saint-Louis' main gym, some hitting the weights, others at the Ping-Pong table, a welcome break from all that still plagues Haiti. Still, just footsteps away, stands a tent city erected by 7,000 homeless Haitians on the complex. ""This is a 400-meter track, and this is my soccer field; it's my land; it's part of the same property,"" Saint-Louis told CNN. He said that on the night after the quake, desperate Haitians climbed over collapsed walls and found refuge on his land. At first, it was understandable, he said. But six months later, it's clear he has become frustrated. ""All the government officials we sent letters to, all the letters went unanswered,"" Saint-Louis said. Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive says the government is working on a resettlement plan, not only to solve land disputes, but also to provide housing for all displaced. But he says the government's hands are tied until billions of pledged funds for Haiti come through. ""Even if we don't have the money, we should have a calendar,"" says Bellerive, stressing the need for a disbursement calendar. And there's also the matter of priority. ""We have to understand that right now, the priority of the government is to protect the population from the next hurricane season,"" Bellerive said. ""Most of our force is going in that direction."" Meanwhile, tent camps, thought to be temporary living arrangements in the aftermath of the quake, have become permanent fixtures all over the capital. More than 1,300 have sprouted -- hot, muddy from the rains, lacking water and proper sanitation, and in some cases breeding grounds for turf wars. An estimated 1.5 million people are homeless and living in such conditions in Haiti. Many are on private property and the crisis is pitting landowners against the desperate. At another tent camp pitched on private property, Aline Masselin washes clothes by hand in a plastic basin that sits on a dirt floor. She has lived in this camp since the night of the quake. Her daughter, Alexandra, was born here just weeks later. Recently, a judge showed up at the site, warning the homeless it was time to go and that the owner was fed up. They missed the deadline to leave, and still they are waiting without a place to go. At a nearby camp, another landowner successfully evicted a group of homeless. ""It was 52 families,"" said Emmanuel Auguste, showing a lot that once housed quake victims who have now resettled in other camps. Asked whether there will be a change six months from now, United Nations humanitarian spokesman Imogen Wall was blunt. ""It will take time to get 1.5 million people back into the kind of long-term living arrangements that they want and need,"" she said. For Vladimir Saint-Louis -- whose athletic complex once boasted tennis and basketball courts, a soccer field and other recreational areas that have now become squatting areas -- news that this will take even longer does not sit well. ""There's a barbershop. There's a cyber cafe. There's a hotel in one of the tents, where people pay to stay there for the night -- I swear to God,"" he said. So far, Saint-Louis has found a way to make peace with the homeless on his land, waiting for a solution to come to salvage his business that's taken a 50 percent hit since it became the site of a tent city. Asked whether he can keep his business afloat, he replied, ""God give the strength. God give me the strength.""

"(CNN) -- It was the holy grail -- the gold medal that President Vladimir Putin and his fellow Russians had dreamed of. It wasn't just about reasserting Russia's standing on the ice hockey stage, this was about pride, tradition and proving that the host nation's star players could deliver in front of the watching world. But there was one small problem -- somebody forgot to tell Finland. When Ilya Kovalchuk opened the scoring for Russia in the first period, it appeared that the host nation would be celebrating come the end of the contest. But Finland had other ideas -- fighting its way to a historic 3-1 victory which broke Russian hearts. ""I cannot explain my feelings. Inside I am absolutely empty,"" Russian captain Pavel Datsyuk told reporters. ""The emotion we feel right now is disappointment, disappointment that we didn't live up to the hopes placed on us. ""There were great hopes placed on us and we didn't live up to them."" Finland, which finished third in Vancouver four years ago, equalized through Juhamatti Aaltonnen's effort before Teemu Selanne completed the comeback ahead of the first intermission. Mikael Granlund added a third early in the second period to seal the win and silence a stunned crowd. Finland will now face the highly-fancied Swedes in the semifinals after defeating Slovenia 5-0. Carl Hagelin scored twice with Alexander Steen, Daniel Sedin and Loui Eriksson also on target. Three-time defending champion Canada overcame a brave effort from Latvia with a 2-1 victory, and will now face the United States in a rematch of the 2010 final. The Americans, who beat Russia earlier in the competition, eased into the semis with a 5-2 victory over the Czech Republic. History maker . Biathlon star Ole Einar Bjoerndalen made history by winning a record 13th medal at the Winter Olympics as Norway claimed gold in the mixed relay. The 40-year-old overtook fellow countryman and cross country ski star Bjoern Daehlie, who won 12 medals during his career. Bjoerndalen, who has now won eight gold medals, teamed up with Emil Hegle Svendsen for the men's legs and Tora Berger and Tiril Eckhoff for the women's, as Norway cruised home. The Czech Republic took silver with Italy in third. Bjoerndalen, taking part in his sixth Games, won his first medal at Nagano in 1998. He has 19 world championship titles to his name and started his Sochi competition by winning the 10 km sprint. Bjoerndalen came close to winning his 13th medal in the 20 km individual last week but had to settle for fourth place. He also missed out on a medal in Tuesday's mass start where he made four errors in the final shooting -- mistakes not repeated on this occasion. ""My shooting was really good, I was more focused than yesterday but today it was working again,"" he told reporters. ""I was really nervous before the race because you don't work for yourself only, but also for the team. ""I had not prepared myself for this it's a dream. Our performance is unique."" Bjoerndalen can add a 14th medal to his collection in Saturday's relay event. Ligety joy . Ted Ligety became the first U.S. male alpine skier to win two Olympic gold medals following his triumph in Wednesday's giant slalom. Ligety, 29, who won the super combined title in 2006, exorcised the demons of four years ago in Vancouver -- where he failed to finish in the medals. ""I have answered Vancouver questions for the last four years,"" he told reporters. ""I didn't do very well there. That hasn't bothered me that much. I moved on past that and my best years have been since then and, in a lot of ways, because of that. Those are always questions I get, even at World Cup."" Ligety had little problem dealing with the pressure on this occasion, carving out an advantage of 0.92 seconds after his first leg before coming home 0.48 ahead of Steve Missillier, with fellow Frenchman Alexis Pinturault claiming bronze. ""It was a huge relief,"" he added following his victory. ""I have been wanting to win this medal for my whole life and even more so, in a realistic sense. in the last few years. All season long everyone talks about the Olympics, Olympics, Olympics. ""At a certain point I was just like, 'Let's do it already. Let's get this thing over with, so we can stop talking about the pressure and everything with it.' ""It's awesome to be able to come here and be able to compete and do it, and finally get the monkey off the back."" Bode blow . Six-time Olympic medalist Bode Miller has confirmed that he will not take part in Saturday's slalom after suffering a knee injury in the giant slalom, where he finished 20th . The American, who missed the whole of last season after undergoing knee surgery, became the oldest alpine ski medalist at the age of 36 years and 127 days when he finished third in the men's super-G at Sochi. ""I'm bummed I'm out for the slalom, I wanted a miracle. Thank you all for the amazing support, it's been incredible,"" tweeted Miller. Miller won super-combined gold in 2010 while also claiming silver in the super-G and bronze in the downhill. He also won two silver medals at the 2002 Salt Lake Games. Family fortunes . There was a snowboarding husband-and-wife triumph in the parallel giant slalom as Vic Wild won gold in the men's event just minutes after his spouse Alena Zavarzina claimed bronze in the women's competition. Wild, who was born in the U.S. but switched to Russia in 2011 following his marriage to Zavarzina, made his decision after funding for the United States Ski and Snowboard Association slalom program was cut. ""I went the hard way,"" the 27-year-old told reporters. ""Russia has lots of good riders. Russia has the opportunity for me to win races, not for me to go to the Olympics. ""Russia is the country that has given me the opportunity to win the medal. If I was still riding for the USA I'd be back home, maybe with some mediocre job, doing something mediocre. That's not who I wanted to be."" Zavarzina was thrilled with her success but was keen to praise her husband following his move to Russia. ""I'm very happy that Vic got gold,"" she said. ""This is what he worked for. He's so far from his hometown, he did an amazing job. ""He had to switch countries, switch nationality, accept something that some people would never accept. ""He has to deal with the Russian mentality, with stuff he's not used to, working with people who don't understand him most of the time."" In the men's event, Switzerland's Nevin Galmarini was second with Russia's Zan Kosir in third. Pre-race favorite Patrizia Kummer claimed Switzerland's 50th Winter Olympic gold medal in the women's event. Tomoka Takeuchi of Japan finished second to become the first woman from Asia to win a medal in snowboard in Olympic history. 'Queen of Skating' Martina Sablikova, the Czech Republic's ""Queen of Skating,"" continued her domination of the women's 5,000 meters by successfully defending her Olympic title. Sablikova's time of six minutes 51.54 seconds was enough to push 3,000m champion Ireen Wust into second ahead of fellow Dutch racer Carien Kleibeuker. The Netherlands have won 21 of the 30 speed skating medals on offer, including six of the 10 golds, but they failed to overhaul Sablikova on this occasion. After winning the 3,000 and 5,000 four years ago, the 26-year-old powered to victory despite having adjust her glasses during the race. ""After winning gold in Vancouver, it's great to win it here in Sochi as well, and this time in front of all my family,"" she told reporters. Bobsleigh joy . Canada's Kaillie Humphries and Heather Moyse successfully defended their Olympic bobsleigh title after pipping the U.S. by a tenth of a second. USA-1, led by Elana Meyers and brakeman Lauryn Williams, had held a lead of .011 seconds going into the final run but endured a disappointing final effort. That allowed Humphries and Moyse to snatch gold, with Americans Jamie Greubel and Aja Evans taking bronze. ""Winning gold is amazing, but walking away satisfied is better. After the third run I knew that if we did the business we could be on top,"" Humphries told reporters. ""When you have to rely on someone else or wait and see, it makes it hard."" Curling . Sweden will face Canada in a repeat of the 2010 women's curling final. Sweden, aiming for a third successive gold medal, saw off Switzerland 7-5 in the semifinals. Canada, unbeaten so far, edged out Great Britain 6-4, and skipper Jenny Jones is confident her team can take revenge on the Swedes this time around. Switzerland and Great Britain will compete for the bronze medal on Thursday. In the men's event, Canada will face Great Britain in the final. Canada defeated China 10-6 while Britain edged out Sweden 6-5. High five . Norway's cross country skiing star Marit Bjoergen claimed the fifth gold medal of her illustrious career after leading her country to victory in the women's team sprint race. Bjoergen, who raced with Ingvild Flugstad Oestberg, had already won skiathlon gold at Sochi to add to the three she won at Vancouver 2010. It left her one short of the record by a female winter Olympian, jointly held by Soviet speed skater Lidia Skoblikova and Russian cross country skier Lyubov Yegorova. Kerttu Niskanen and Aino-Kaisa Saarinen of Finland came second with Ida Ingemarsdotter and Stina Nilsson in third. In the men's race, Finland produced a stunning victory to claim the country's first gold in Sochi thanks to the efforts of Sami Jauhojaervi and Iivo Niskanen. The pair, who took it in turns to perform three sprints each, finished in 23 minutes and 14.89 seconds to see off Russia and Sweden. Classy Kim . In the women's figure skating, defending champion Kim Yu-Na of Korea claimed top spot in the short program. Her score of 74.92 was the highest ahead of home favorite Adelina Sotnikova . Italy's Carolina Kostner, produced a fine performance to finish on 74.12. to finish ahead of U.S. medal hopeful Gracie Gold. The competition will conclude with Thursday's free program.","Russia's men fail in their quest for ice hockey gold .

"(CNN) -- A Brazilian actor died after accidentally hanging himself during the play ""The Passion of the Christ,"" a local hospital said. Tiago Klimeck, 27, was one of the actors from a local theater company taking part in an independent production of the play April 6 in the city of Itarare. Klimeck died Sunday after spending more than two weeks in a medically induced coma due to extensive brain injuries from a prolonged lack of oxygen after accidentally hanging himself, according to the Hospital Santa Casa de Misericordia, in the neighboring city of Itapeva. The cause of death was not immediately available. Photos taken by a local photographer show the final moments of the play as Klimeck, in the role of Judas Iscariot, hangs himself as described in the Bible in the book of Matthew. Klimeck wore a harness under his robe during the play, according to CNN affiliate TV Record. Police investigator Jose Victor Bassetti told the news station this was the third year the local fire department let the theater company borrow the harness for the play and that Klimeck was not supervised because he knew how to use the equipment. The harness, along with the rope used in the play, are now being analyzed at the Criminal Institute of Sorocaba. Luiz Carlos Rosner owns a sandwich cart next to the city square where the play was taking place. He described the anxiety after cast members realized Klimeck was unconscious. ""One of the actors came over to me, desperate, explaining there was someone unconscious hanging from the rope and that he wanted to cut it,"" Rosner told TV Record.

"(CNN) -- The stakes are high this November, for the strength of our economy and the direction of our country. For me, like a lot of us, the stakes are also personal: The choice I make in the voting booth will significantly affect my friends, my loved ones and my generation. Like many millennials, I am concerned about the job market and costs of college. And I'm worried about access to affordable health care for all. But I could never have predicted just how intensely personal this election would become. When I was publicly attacked for testifying before members of Congress, I became even more keenly aware that the rights that generations of women fought so hard to achieve could be rolled back easily. That began a national conversation that I believe highlighted President Barack Obama and former Gov. Mitt Romney's vastly different values and visions. Obama is committed to rebuilding our economy upon the values of fairness and opportunity and the belief that all Americans, both men and women, must have the rights they deserve. That's why I'm proud to endorse his re-election. He's demonstrated those values since he moved into the Oval Office. The first law he signed was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which empowers women to challenge pay discrimination in the workplace. He's now asking Congress to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act to help stop pay discrimination before it starts and close the 23% gap between women's earnings and men's earnings. Obama also made college more affordable by doubling our investment in Pell Grant scholarships, giving students tuition tax breaks and by fighting to keep interest rates low on student loans. He's helping millions of students graduate without the weight of unbearable loans and financial insecurity. Most importantly, Obamacare is providing vital health coverage for millions of young Americans, especially women and families. When the reforms are fully in effect, we will no longer be denied coverage because of a preexisting condition or charged more for insurance because we are women. We will finally have affordable access to preventive care, such as prenatal exams, cancer screenings and contraception. Health reform makes real the fair premise that our access to basic health care shouldn't depend on where we work, where we go to school or what gender we are. Opinion: Slurs won't silence women . Obama has moved our country forward by working not only to ensure Americans' prosperity, but also by guaranteeing that our rights are protected and we all have opportunities to succeed. By comparison, Romney has offered only frightening promises to send us backward. On fair pay for women, Romney says he won't do anything to make the situation worse; this is little comfort when he then says he won't do anything to make it better. He won't tell us whether he would have signed the Lilly Ledbetter law, and he failed to stand up to congressional Republicans who opposed the Paycheck Fairness Act. Romney would cut his own taxes, but make college more expensive for young people just getting on their feet. Those aren't the values we want in a president -- and they're a stark contrast to Obama, who would raise his own taxes and keep cutting them for the middle class. Romney would allow the college tax credit expire for millions of middle-class families and embraced the congressional Republican budget that would let student loan interest rates double. Instead of explaining how he would improve Americans' access to health care, Romney says only that he would ""repeal Obamacare"" and ""kill it dead on its first day."" In practical terms, that means Romney would strip health care coverage from the more than 6.6 million young Americans who, thanks to Obamacare, are not being dropped from their parents' insurance coverage. He would allow insurance companies to keep charging women a billion dollars more every year than they charge men. He would eliminate mandatory preventative care coverage despite its life-saving benefits. In this, Romney has revealed an alarming lack of the vision required to lead. Fundamentally, it's that capacity for leadership that is most important in a president, which brings me back to the national conversation fueled by the verbal assault I experienced earlier this year. In the aftermath of those attacks, I was heartened by the many Americans of all political stripes who reached out to me and supported me. They knew that whether we agree or disagree, as Americans we defend one another's right to speak before our elected officials without enduring personal attacks. Obama responded as so many Americans did, by condemning those attacks as antithetical to our democracy. Romney, when pressed to address those attacks, could only say, ""Those aren't the words I would have chosen."" If Romney lacks the leadership to stand up to extremists in his own party, then he's not the president we need.At a time when women's rights especially are under virulent attack, we cannot elect a leader who won't or can't stand up to those extremists and protect the rights that generations of women have fought so hard to ensure. Thankfully, we don't have to. We have a president who has consistently shown he will defend those rights while working to ensure that all women and men have all the protections and opportunities they need to pursue economic success. But if we're going to keep Obama in the White House, we need to get involved, get out the vote and do what Romney refuses to do on everything from fair pay to women's rights: speak up. I'll never stop speaking up, and I hope you'll join me.

"(Wired) -- Android users, take note: Google Keep — a long-overdue app for creating lists and reminders — has arrived. Keep is essentially Google's answer to Evernote and the Post-It. Believe it or not, while Apple's iOS has had a Notes app and a Reminders app baked in for some time now, Keep is Google's first mobile app focused on solving either of these problems. As you'd expect, Keep is integrated with Google Drive, the cloud storage service Google wants anyone who uses anything it makes to use. You can type out a reminder or list using the Keep Android app, which landed in Google Play on Wednesday (after leaking for a bit Monday), or on the web at drive.google.com/keep. Aside from tapping out a note, you can also store photos in the app, and you can record voice notes, which Keep then transcribes into text, so you can read or listen to them later. If you snap a photo in the app, you can then edit it using all of Android's built-in camera features (cropping, color balancing, photo filters and borders). Using Android's sharing features, you share a photo by e-mail, text messaging, Picasa, Google+, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Path, Dropbox and even Amazon's Send to Kindle feature.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Farmers from a village in southwest China literally turned a multimillion dollar windfall into a wall of cash. This week, residents of Jianshe village in Sichuan Province took delivery of blocks of money worth 13 million yuan ($2.1 million) in year-end bonuses they had earned from a rural co-operative scheme. Residents had invested in farmland and small-scale hydropower plants since 2010. Around 340 out of 483 households are shareholders in the small village, which has a population of less than 2,000 people. Before they could distribute their earnings to individual residents ahead of Chinese New Year, they had the problem of where to store -- and guard -- it. Chief villager, Jin Hongyuan, told local media he moved the money inside the village committee office after transporting it from the bank on Monday. To keep the money safe, he appointed three villagers to sleep on the banknotes inside the office, while four others stood guard outside. ""We used 800,000 yuan as a mattress, 420,000 yuan as pillows, and put the others aside,"" Jin told the West China Metropolis Daily. The following day, the banknotes were moved into the village square and stacked to form a seven-foot long wall and create a $2 million photo opportunity. Many villagers said they had never seen so much money before. Villager Jin Ou, who collected the most dividends from his investments, was delighted to finally get his hands on 300,000 yuan ($49,000) in cash. ""It's so cold, and I've been counting (cash) for the whole day, my fingers are all numb,"" he told reporters. The story was an immediate hit with China's legions of Internet users. One netizen, known as ""xiaomili_xiaomi"" took to Weibo, a Twitter-like service, to post: ""Let's be friends, rich villagers!"" Others asked if they could join in on the investment bonanza and become a member of the rural co-operative. Unfortunately, the scheme only allows investors who are members of Jianshe village. The only way to join is by marrying into the families, said Jin. CNN's intern April Ma contributed to this report.","Villagers in China's Sichuan province build a $2.1M ""money wall"" out of year-end bonuses .

"(CNN) -- A British woman on a charity swim across the English Channel died during her bid, according to a post on her fundraising Facebook page. Susan Taylor, 34, collapsed near the end of a 21-mile crossing from England to France about 5:30 p.m. Sunday, according to a report from The Independent. ""Whilst attempting to swim the English Channel yesterday my sister, Susan collapsed suddenly in the water. She was immediately recovered from the water and treated on the support boat. She was then air lifted by helicopter to a hospital in Boulonge. Susan tragically passed away,"" the posting on the Create a Ripple Channel Swim Facebook page said. Media reports did not give a cause of death. A photo of the swim posted earlier Sunday showed calm waters in the channel. ""Please respect the families' privacy whilst they come to terms with what has happened,"" the Facebook post said. Taylor undertook the swim to raise money for Rainbows Hospice and Diabetes UK, according to the Facebook page. She raised about $27,000 (18,000 British pounds) as of noon ET Monday, according to the donation site virginmoneygiving.com. The Channel Swimming Association, which authorizes and supports channel crossings, called Taylor's death ""a tragic loss under valiant circumstances."" ""We extend our sympathy and thoughts to her family and friends at this very sad time. We have been asked by the family not to comment further. We will respect their wishes,"" a post on the association's website said. Taylor's father, Ian Wright, spoke to British media. ""I'm devastated. I've lost the best person in the world. She was just wonderful,"" he told the Independent. He told the paper his daughter worked part-time as an accountant while pursuing her charitable endeavors. Geoff Ellis, chief executive of Rainbows Hospice, praised Taylor's fundraising efforts in an interview with the BBC. ""Susan was a wonderful woman who would do anything for anybody. She has been a much-loved ambassador at Rainbows for over two years, helping out at events and tirelessly fundraising for us,"" Ellis was quoted as saying. Kevin Murphy, secretary of the Channel Swimming and Piloting Federation, told the BBC that deaths during channel swims were rare. ""We know it's an extreme sport, but its safety record is second to none. In nearly 150 years, there have been only half a dozen fatalities,"" the BBC quoted him as saying. About 20 to 30 people make successful solo swims across the English Channel each year, according to soloswims.com. The Channel Swimming and Piloting Federation reports 10 successful crossings this year; the most recent of those are four completed crossings on Monday. Although the straight-line distance across the channel is 21 miles, swimmer must off swim much farther because of the effects of tides.","Susan Taylor collapsed near end of 21-mile crossing, report says .

"(CNN) -- Drumming on the beach, moving in time with junkanu dancers and eating heaping plates of mashed plantain soaked in coconut stew -- more than likely these aren't the experiences you imagine while planning a trip to Belize. In fact, you have to venture off the newbie trail, and head to the southern Stann Creek and Toledo Districts to experience Belize's unique Afro-Caribbean Garifuna culture. The Garifuna live along the coast, in the most scenic areas of Belize, where miles of beaches run east to south. One of the smallest groups in the country, they make up just 4% of a total population of around 325,000. The Garifuna are descendants of Carib Indians and West Africans who escaped Spanish slave ships wrecked off the coast of St. Vincent in 1635. In 1763, when the British invaded, the Garífuna were exiled to Roatán in 1798. From there, they migrated to mainland Honduras, and continued along the coast -- to Guatemala, Nicaragua and arriving in Belize by dugout canoe in 1802. According to the Belize National Garífuna Council, there are an estimated 500,000 Garífuna worldwide, including large populations in the United States. About 15,000 remain in Belize, primarily in Dangriga, Hopkins, Seine Bight, Punta Gorda and Barranco. Passing through these areas, it's difficult to tell that this culture has an endangered status. Signs of African ancestry are evident, whether in the thatched roofs of ceremonial temples, frequent echo of drums, fishing canoes dotting the sea at sunrise or girls having their hair braided under a tree on a hot afternoon. ""Many of the kids are losing the language; they're embarrassed to speak it,"" says Marva Augustin, a Hopkins Village native and owner of Laruni Hati Beyabu (""Under the Moonlight"") Diner. Partially a reaction to language erosion, a community-wide effort has taken hold to preserve and share the Afro-Amerindian heritage, particularly through music, dance and food. This summer, The Garífuna Collective, seven talented musicians hailing from Belize's Garífuna villages, toured the U.S. and Canada for the first time, winning over crowds with traditional, hip-swaying beats. ""I see us as a vehicle for the next generation,"" says Joshua Arana, the band's lead drummer and one of Belize's most respected musicians. Arana also teaches at Galen University, in western Belize. In Belize, tourism continues to creep along the coast and local towns and villages are offering more opportunities for visitor interaction. ""The Garífuna culture isn't only for the Garífuna, it's to be shared with the world,"" says Desiree Diego, a native of Dangriga and lead singer of the Garífuna Collective. Here are seven ways to take her up on the offer. 1. Tour a Garífuna museum . The country's primary collection of Garifuna artifacts is housed at the Luba Garífuna Museum in Belize City. On display are cooking utensils, arts and crafts, photographs, books and traditional clothing. Others worth visiting are the Gulisi Garífuna Museum in Dangriga and the Barranco Culture House in the Toledo District.

Barranco Culture House, village of Barranco, two hours' drive from of Punta Gorda, in Toledo District . 2. Sample traditional Garífuna dishes . Traditional dishes consist of cassava, fish, coconut and mashed plantains. In every Garífuna kitchen you'll find cooking utensils such as coconut graters, mortar and pestle and other tools reminiscent of West African ancestry. At Hopkins Village, several eateries offer traditional dishes in an effort to expose visitors to local cuisine. A typical offering is a plate of hudut -- fish cooked in a coconut broth and served with mashed plantains. No fork needed.

Take drumming lessons . A symbol of the Garífuna culture, drums represent a connection to African ancestors. In Hopkins, the award-winning Lebeha Drumming Center offers individual and group lessons. Students learn the differences between primero and segundo drums and punta and paranda beats. The Warasa Garifuna Drum School in Punta Gorda is another great choice.

Three miles outside Dangriga, the family-run Sabal Farm produces cassava bread, a Garífuna staple. The thin, cracker-like snack is distributed and sold across various parts of Belize. ""We are the only cassava-making farm in the country,"" says Cyril Sabal. ""We've been here for 25 years, and we bake twice a week."" The process begins with a group of eight women, who sit in a circle talking while peeling 12 bags of cassava over four hours. Simultaneously, peeled roots are passed on to be washed, grated, sifted and prepared into a thin flour. Then the women skillfully toss and bake the bread by fire hearth. To schedule a visit, contact Belize licensed tour guide David Obi (+501 602 3077; $20 per person). 5. Make a drum . In Dangriga, on a corner of Y-Not Island, where the North Stann Creek River merges with the sea, Austin Rodriguez, 82, carves the country's finest Garifuna drums. Against a backdrop of pelicans and fishermen at sea, Rodriguez and his daughter have kept the drum-making tradition alive for close to 30 years. Stop by the beachfront space for an impromptu or scheduled lesson, in exchange for a donation of your choice. ""I opened this shop so the young people will come learn how to make Garífuna drums,"" says Rodriguez. ""But anyone can come. I am here all day, until the night."" The entire drum making process takes at least a week and you'll need all the muscles you've got. You can try your hand at any of the various stages, from using a chainsaw to hollow out the wood -- typically cedar or mahogany -- to preparing and attaching the deer skin to the top of the drum with vines. Or you can pick up an autographed instrument on your way out, available for sale in various sizes. Austin Rodriguez, Y-Not Island, Dangriga; casual, drop-in system preferred; no charge but donations welcome . 6. Visit Hopkins Village . The Garífuna village of Hopkins has a near five-mile stretch of sand, with few people in sight at any one time. No vendors and no noise, aside from the sound of distant drums. The village offers a wide range of affordable accommodations, Garífuna restaurants and a drumming school, making Hopkins an ideal place to enjoy and appreciate Garifuna culture. Hopkins Bay Resort; +501 523 7320 or +1 877 467 2297 (U.S.); rooms from $250 . 7. Experience Garífuna Settlement Day in Dangriga . Garífuna Settlement Day (November 19) celebrates the arrival of the Garifuna people to Belize by dugout canoe, with a live reenactment along the shores of Dangriga. Dusk-till-dawn drumming and dancing at local bars, or ""sheds,"" begins on November 18. At sunrise, crowds along the banks of the North Stann Creek River cheer the arrival of the dories. The day continues with drumming in the streets, a religious ceremony and an afternoon parade.

"(CNN) -- While following the horrific events at the Washington Navy Yard, I was struck by something beyond the tragic developments. It was the number of women in law enforcement who were directing the response to those events, and who were center-stage -- at press conferences, in news articles and on my TV screen â€” as they updated the public. They included Cathy Lanier, chief of District of Columbia's Metropolitan Police Department; Valerie Parlave, assistant director in charge, FBI's Washington Field Office; Teresa Chambers, chief of the United States Park Police and they have largely been the face of officialdom in the Navy Yard shootings. The gender of these women so prominent in handling the unfolding crisis has gone unmentioned â€” and this alone is worthy of note, considering the history of women in law enforcement, long a male-dominated profession. These women are simply law enforcement leaders doing the jobs they were hired to do. And there are more: Women also head the U.S. Marshal's Service, the Secret Service, the Drug Enforcement Administration and Amtrak Police Department. This kind of representation is relatively new. Women have worked in law enforcement since the 19th century. But until the 1970s, they were mainly confined to clerical jobs or dispatch. Affirmative action opened doors, but just a crack. Women back then still held only 2% of total police force jobs. Today, FBI figures put the total number of women in law enforcement at around 12% of the nation's roughly 700,000 police officers -- with representation highest in big city departments, where females can account for as many as one in four. In wasn't until 1985 that America saw a major city swear in its first female police chief, when Penny Harrington took the job in Portland, Oregon. Since then, the chief has been addressed as ""ma'am"" in Boston, San Francisco, Milwaukee, Detroit, Orlando, Houston, Tampa and dozens of smaller cities. The most recent figures from the National Association of Women Law Enforcement Executives indicate there are approximately 220 female police chiefs across the country. The rise to top leadership positions in law enforcement bumps up against the same barriers as other professions, of course. Female officers call it the ""brass ceiling."" (aka ""the bulletproof glass ceiling""). The pioneering chief Harrington (who resigned after a rough tenure) talked about that in an interview in Next Women Business Magazine. Harrington, founder of the National Center for Women and Policing, said: ""Unfortunately, the obstacles have not changed much since I started in 1964. The culture still values physical strength and devalues reasoning and negotiating skills."" She also said that because so many officers start in the military, ""they bring those rigid attitudes with them."" She added, however, that there are ""many wonderful men in law enforcement who are supportive of women, and who are excellent community officers."" D.C. Chief Lanier agreed that the march to the top still has pitfalls. She told USAToday last month: ""There is a segment of the population that is still watching, waiting and hoping that we don't do well."" Still, she cites accomplishments in the 40 years since women were allowed to join men in patrol cars. Women represent 22% of the D.C. police force. ""Women (officers) are paying attention to what's happening in the top ranks. ... I think, overall, people are starting to appreciate these changes."" There is clearly room to improve, but as the women handling the Washington Navy Yard crisis so powerfully show, the brass ceiling -- like the glass ceiling -- has begun to crack. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Peggy Drexler.","Peggy Drexler: Female law-enforcement officials prominent in Navy Yard shootings .

"(CNN) -- Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson still spend their days outside the Lowndes County Courthouse in Georgia, standing vigil for their son, Kendrick, whose mysterious death a year ago poses many questions in their minds. They simply want to know how their son ended up in a rolled-up mat in his high school's gymnasium on January 10, 2013; his body was found a day later, when students in a gym class glimpsed his feet in the mat. The original investigation by the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office concluded that 17-year-old Kendrick Johnson died by accident while reaching for a shoe, but the Johnsons don't believe that. They're planning yet another rally in Valdosta's James W. Saunders Memorial Park at noon Saturday to again demand answers. ""They know something happened in that gym and they don't want it to come out,"" Kenneth Johnson said. Federal authorities, too, have their doubts about the original investigation's findings. CNN has learned that the FBI has been in South Georgia conducting interviews, and the Johnsons recently spent almost three hours with investigators at an FBI field office in Thomasville, an hour west of their hometown. U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Georgia Michael Moore said in November that federal authorities would investigate Johnson's death, and last month, the FBI seized the original hard drives from the surveillance system at Lowndes High School, according to a source with knowledge of the investigation surrounding the hard drives. The federal investigation has yielded few details, but Moore issued a statement Thursday: ""As we approach the anniversary of Kendrick's death, I am mindful that there is a great deal of interest in the status of our efforts. As I have previously stated, in order to protect the integrity of any ongoing investigation by my office, I typically refrain from making any specific comments about the investigation until it is concluded. As we continue our work in this matter, my thoughts and prayers will be with the Johnson family this weekend."" The Lowndes County Sheriff's Office hasn't commented on every twist and turn in the case but has repeatedly stood by its investigation. ""It was not a rash decision that was leapt to. We've drawn this out, done a thorough investigation, and we think we've covered all bases,"" Lt. Stryde Jones told CNN in May, the day after investigators closed the case. On Friday, the office released a statement through its attorney, saying, ""We continue to support Mr. Moore's interest in these tragic circumstances and applaud his urging of the community to come forward with facts and evidence rather than feelings or opinions, no matter how sincere they may be."" The Sheriff's Office said it had interviewed more than 100 people -- students, teachers and parents among them -- but the timing of those interviews raises questions for at least one analyst. CNN examined the 522-page police file and found that investigators spoke to 111 people. Eighteen of those interviews occurred the day Johnson's body was found, and another 15 people were interviewed later that month. Investigators then spoke to five more people in February and March before conducting interviews with 72 people in April, about the time media coverage of Johnson's death gained momentum. One person was interviewed in May, according to the investigative file. Former Washington Metropolitan Police Department Detective Mike Brooks, an analyst for CNN's sister network, HLN, said that if he were involved in the investigation, he would ""want to interview someone that day, that night or maybe the following day while things are still fresh in their mind."" The first responders weren't interviewed until April 17, according to the file, and the paramedic who noticed bruising on Johnson's jaw -- and considered the gym to be a crime scene -- wasn't interviewed until April 18. Investigators didn't speak to the janitors who cleaned the gym until April 26. Asked why the bulk of the interviews weren't conducted until April, the Sheriff's Office said, in the statement released by its attorney, that ""Sheriff (Chris) Prine maintains every confidence that his office's investigation was timely and properly prioritized and handled with the necessary diligence to assure that all leads were examined and exhausted and he welcomes the U.S. Attorney's continued review of the case."" Surveillance video shows other students in the gym with Johnson before he died, but according to local investigators' reports, there's no record of interviews with any of them, although they spoke to more than 90 students. ""I looked at the crime scene investigation, evidence collection, the autopsy, the interviews that were done and were not done in a timely fashion. This is a sloppy case from the get-go,"" Brooks said. The Sheriff's Office noted that it provided its investigative files to CNN in May, but the names in that file were redacted. CNN did not receive the unamended version until October 30, and the network did not receive the surveillance video until November 6. CNN's Devon Sayers contributed to this report.","NEW: Original investigation was ""timely and properly prioritized and handled,"" investigators say .

"(CNN) -- The folks in Buffalo are quite used to bad weather, but Tuesday night they were enduring a brutal trifecta of inclement conditions: unusually cold temperatures, high winds and almost another foot of snow. It was so bad the Buffalo Sabres NHL team did something they haven't done since 2000: They told their fans to stay home and postponed their game at the First Niagara Center. A blizzard warning is in effect for three counties until 6 a.m., forecasters said, and CNN affiliate WIVB reported one wind gust of 51 mph. There were also flood warnings in some areas because of broken water mains. During an afternoon news conference, Erie County officials told residents to stay off the roads and said there was a significant number of road closures. Officials said it would be Wednesday afternoon at the earliest before most roads would be cleared. But in a small bit of good news, part of Lake Erie was frozen over, meaning the lake-effect snow system pulled less moisture and snowfall amounts were significantly lower than first feared. Still, one area of Buffalo had 14 inches of new snow Tuesday, WIVB said. The Sabres said their game against the Carolina Hurricanes would be played at a date yet to be determined. Across the nation, many cities were still dealing with the effects of a polar vortex that dropped lower than normal and brought below-freezing temperatures to many states, including Florida. And, unfortunately, the cold weather was also being blamed for one new death from hypothermia, authorities said Tuesday. New York City saw a record low for the date. It was just four degrees in Central Park, breaking a record of six set in 1896. That's not quite as bad as the all-time low of 15 below zero in 1934. But with the wind chill, temperatures still felt well below zero -- a 69-degree drop from Monday, when the weather was a relatively sultry 50 degrees with wind chill. Temperatures plummeted below freezing somewhere in all 50 states Tuesday morning -- most, but not all, due to the arctic blast hovering like an ice chest, according to CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen. (The cold regions of California and Hawaii, for example, had nothing to do with the vortex.) In Florida, despite the low temperatures, crops were not damaged, the state's Fruit and Vegetable Association told CNN. Authorities have blamed at least 16 deaths on the cold so far, including 11 from traffic accidents and three involving hypothermia. A spokesman for the Cook County medical examiner's office in Illinois said Tuesday that one person had died as a result of the extreme cold. And animals are suffering and dying, too. CNN affiliate WISH reported seven dogs froze to death near Indianapolis after being left outside, according to Marion County, Indiana, animal care officials. At Chicago's Lincoln Park Zoo, Anana -- a polar bear who never grew the thick layer of fat that bears in the Arctic do -- had to be brought inside Monday. And at the National Aviary in Pittsburgh, bald eagles and African penguins, ""who are used to temperate climates,"" were taken off exhibit until the weather warms up, the facility reported. Travel snarled . The weather left more than 500 people stranded on three Amtrak trains overnight in western and north-central Illinois, Amtrak spokesman Marc Magliari said. All three Chicago-bound trains -- two coming from California, and one originating in Quincy, Illinois -- stopped Monday afternoon or evening because conditions prevented them from going farther. At least one was stopped by ""heavy snow drifting in a trenchlike area,"" Magliari said. ""The passengers were sheltered in place overnight,"" Magliari said. ""It wasn't safe to take people off these trains ... because there wasn't a good way to get people to and from the trains in the bad weather."" Amtrak worked to make other arrangements, putting some passengers on buses. All the trains had heat and electricity throughout, he said. ""It certainly wasn't as comfortable as anyone would have liked, but it was not unsafe,"" Magliari said. ""It was the best thing to do in these temperatures in these conditions at that time overnight in that part of the state."" Jeanette Floyd, who boarded one of the California trains in Kansas City, praised the crew for helping to keep passengers positive, but said her trip -- which ended up taking more than a day from start to finish -- still was ""one of the worst (experiences) ever."" ""I can't feel my butt because it's just not there anymore, just sitting for literally 26 hours,"" Floyd told CNN Tuesday after arriving in Chicago by bus. Floyd and other passengers said the crew gave them a complimentary meal during the stranding. A fourth Amtrak train was stuck for nine hours Monday night and early Tuesday near Kalamazoo, Michigan, about 300 passengers had to wait more than nine hours to reach their destination, CNN affiliate WXMI reported. ""It was kind of like purgatory,"" a passenger told CNN affiliate WLS, adding that it was ""not quite hellish because there was good company."" The train, which was bound for Chicago, finally arrived at the city's Union Station on Monday night, WLS reported. More than 2,600 flights were canceled within, into or out of the United States on Tuesday, according to flightaware.com. Nearly 6,000 were delayed, the flight-tracking website said. New York resident Mindy Goldberg said her family's flight back from Mexico had been diverted to Boston because of the weather. ""I just called my kids' school to tell them they wouldn't be there, and she said, 'Everyone's stuck somewhere,'"" Goldberg told CNN affiliate WBZ. Ships ran into trouble as well. The U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Hollyhock had to break through ice in Lake Michigan. In Indianapolis, Los Angeles resident Jason Bentley decided to play in the snow outside the airport after learning that his flight home had been canceled Sunday. It was 15 below zero Farenheit (minus 26 Celsius). JetBlue cancels Northeast flights to rest crews . ""This is the wettest snow I've ever touched, the easiest snow to make a snowman and to have snowball fights,"" Bentley wrote in a CNN Facebook discussion. ""It's also probably the worst (weather) I've ever been in because of the temperature."" ""Sick as a dog. Car is dead. Roads are closed. Space heater died yesterday,"" Amanda Brooke of Valparaiso, Indiana, said on Facebook. ""Missing doctors' appointments I've had for six months."" She described herself as ""cold, sick, and trying not to be miserable."" In Columbus, Ohio, Alexis Mitchell-Tremain posted that she still had to go to work. ""So, it's layers of clothing, the hubby's big woolly scarf, and a lot of coffee."" Jason Coppula in Pittsburgh can relate. ""I have about three layers on, two gloves, two (pairs of) socks, scarf and ski goggles,"" he wrote on Facebook. Extreme wind chills mean flesh can freeze in as little as five minutes. Several major school districts are closed Tuesday, including those in Minneapolis and Atlanta, to prevent children from waiting outside at bus stops. When will this end? Temperatures should start edging higher on Wednesday. By Thursday, most of the country will be back to normal, CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said. In fact, some temperatures may even be a bit higher than usual. CNN's Carma Hassan, Kait Richmond, Deborah Doft, Matt Smith, Indra Petersons, Stephanie Elam, and Paul Vercammen contributed to this report.","NEW: Frozen lake means less snow, but it's still brutal in Buffalo .

"(CNN) -- Three crew members and two passengers were injured Monday when a United Airlines flight encountered severe turbulence, a spokeswoman for the airline said. The captain declared an emergency on United Flight 1676, which was flying from Denver, Colorado, to Billings, Montana, said United's Christen Davis. The flight met turbulence as it descended. ""Our primary focus is assisting our employees and passengers who were injured, and our flight safety team will review what happened,"" the spokeswoman said. The Federal Aviation Administration said the pilot ""declared a medical emergency after a flight attendant was injured by turbulence. The plane landed in Billings without incident."" Three flight attendants and two passengers were taken to hospitals, said Luke Punzenberger, a spokesman for the airline. All were treated and released except one flight attendant. There were 114 passengers and five crew members onboard, including passenger Bill Dahlin. ""There was a lot of screaming, a lot of hollering,"" he told CNN affiliate KTVQ. Dahlin said one woman hit the ceiling so hard that the ceiling cracked. He said he thought the crew was just as surprised by the sudden turbulence as the passengers were. ""I think they were somewhat panicked,"" KTVQ reported Dahlin said. ""I think they were trying to assess things themselves so they really didn't offer any explanation because of what happened so quickly."" Transatlantic flights set to be bumpier . Last month, a United Airlines flight returned to Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey after turbulence injured five flight attendants. The plane hit ""severe turbulence"" about 45 minutes into the Beijing-bound United Flight 89, said Ron Marsico, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the airport.

"London (CNN) -- A British man accused of orchestrating his wife's murder by hit men while they were honeymooning in South Africa has lost a High Court appeal to block his extradition there until he is fit to stand trial. The judges ruled that Shrien Dewani can be extradited as long as the South African government pledges to return him to the United Kingdom should he ultimately prove unfit to be tried. Dewani's lawyers had argued that he should not be extradited while he was unfit to stand trial. He is being treated for post traumatic stress disorder and a depressive illness. His legal team can appeal the decision at the Supreme Court. Dewani is accused of hiring a crew of hit men to kill his wife, Anni Dewani, 28, during a taxi ride in Cape Town in November 2010, just over two weeks after their wedding. Taxi driver Zola Tongo confessed within weeks of the bride's death that he had hired two men to kill her. In a plea deal with South African authorities, he said he was paid by Shrien Dewani to carry out the hit and to make it look like the two were the victims of a carjacking as they were driving through a township on the edge of Cape Town. Tongo was subsequently sentenced to 18 years in prison for his part in the killing. Proper protection . In their ruling, the judges at the High Court in London said there was some prospect that Dewani could recover sufficiently to be fit to stand trial. It is also possible that the continued uncertainty over his extradition could act to deter his recovery. They also said they were confident in the ability of South Africa's authorities to treat Dewani fairly. ""The death of the appellant's wife Anni occurred over three years ago,"" they said in their conclusions. ""The interests of justice, including the interests of her family who like other families of murdered persons wish to see a trial take place as soon as is practicable, require expedition and that there should be no further delay, provided that proper protection is afforded to the appellant in the manner we have set out.""

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama called Monday for Congress to approve a $50 billion plan to begin upgrading the nation's crumbling infrastructure, saying such an investment is vital to creating much-needed construction jobs and keeping the nation competitive in the global economy. In a Rose Garden statement at the White House, Obama called for bipartisan support when Congress returns after the November 2 mid-term elections so that the first phase of a proposed six-year infrastructure development plan can begin. ""We've always had the best infrastructure,"" Obama said, noting that one in five construction workers are unemployed right now. ""This is work that needs to be done. There are workers ready to do it. All we need is political will."" The president first announced the plan on Labor Day, and present and former Cabinet members as well as some governors and mayors around the nation joined him to support the initiative. Despite their call, it remains uncertain if the issue can overcome the deep partisan divide in Congress, especially after an election expected to erode Democratic majorities in both chambers or even return Republicans to control. The main Republican campaign theme for the upcoming election has been excessive government spending under Obama and the Democratic-controlled Congress that has failed to lower the unemployment rate below 9 percent. In particular, Republicans say the $787 billion economic stimulus bill passed last year has failed to bring promised jobs and other economic benefits. Obama and Democrats say the stimulus bill prevented the recession that began in the previous administration from worsening into a full economic depression. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood responded sharply on that topic when questioned by reporters Monday about whether new infrastructure spending would provide better results than the stimulus bill. Noting that the $48 billion in stimulus money for the transportation sector funded 14,000 projects that employed thousands of people, LaHood said that Americans know the bill worked ""because they see their friends and neighbors working on roads and bridges and transit systems."" ""The idea that our stimulus didn't work is nonsense,"" he said. Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, a Democrat and strong Obama supporter, called stimulus spending on infrastructure ""the single best job creator we can do in this country."" ""It created well-paying jobs that can't be outsourced,"" Rendell said. ""It's just what the economy needs."" A study by the Department of Treasury and the Council of Economic Advisers shows a majority of infrastructure-related jobs would come in the construction field, followed by manufacturing and retail. LaHood added that Congress has traditionally passed transportation bills containing infrastructure investment with strong bipartisan support. ""There are no Democratic or Republicans bridges or roads,"" he said, adding that Democratic Rep. Jim Oberstar of Minnesota, the chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, told him there is Republican support for new infrastructure investment. Obama and LaHood said the cost of new investment would be paid for, rather than adding to the debt. However, LaHood stopped short of offering specific ways to do so, saying only that a number of options were being considered. Senior administration officials say private funds also would be used for the infrastructure overhaul. They suggested the $50 billion from Congress could be paid for by closing loopholes in the tax code related to oil and gas production or through other cost-cutting measures. CNN's Rachel Streitfeld contributed to this story.","NEW: Obama calls for a $50 billion plan to start upgrading infrastructure .

"(CNN) -- It's the largest gift in the nearly 400-year history of Harvard College, a nine-figure sum aimed at giving hundreds of students who win admission ""against long odds"" the means to attend. The $150 million donation from hedge-fund chieftain Ken Griffin, class of '89, will fund full scholarships for 200 Harvard undergraduates and provide matching funds for another 600, the university announced Wednesday. ""It's about having a chance to play a part in helping to ensure the next generation of leaders in America has access to the finest institution in the world,"" said Griffin, who founded the Chicago-based Citadel fund a year after graduating with a bachelor's degree in economics. Griffin told CNN the scholarships are aimed at students who ""have done really, really well in their classwork against long odds. This is their chance to go to America's greatest college."" Harvard tuition currently runs just under $39,000 a year, with total costs -- room, board and fees -- running more than $56,000. With an endowment of more than $32 billion, the famed Cambridge, Massachusetts, school isn't hurting for money and has been ramping up its financial aid in recent years. The average student gets about $12,000 a year in aid. About 20% of the college's 6,700 undergrads come from families that earn less than $65,000 a year. They pay no expenses. Griffin, who already has established one Harvard scholarship, said the school's commitment to ""need-blind"" admissions and equality of opportunity inspired his contribution. ""I think for me, as a Harvard alumnus who really did benefit tremendously from a Harvard experience, this is as a chance for me to really support a set of values and beliefs that I believe in strongly,"" he said. Harvard College is the undergraduate arm of Harvard University. ""Ken Griffin's extraordinary philanthropy is opening Harvard's gates wider to the most talented students in the world, no matter their economic circumstances,"" Harvard University President Drew Gilpin Faust said in a statement announcing the gift. The scholarships Griffin's donation will fund mean ""Harvard is more accessible than ever before,"" she said. Also included in the gift is $10 million for an endowed professorship in business administration at the Harvard Business School, which will be named for Griffin. The university's financial aid office will also bear his name, the school announced.","Griffin says future leaders should be able to attend ""the finest institution in the world""

"London (CNN) -- A former Guantanamo Bay detainee from Britain is among four people arrested on suspicion of Syria-related terrorism offenses, UK counterterror police said Tuesday. Moazzam Begg, from Hall Green in Birmingham, is ""suspected of attending a terrorist training camp and facilitating terrorism overseas,"" a statement from West Midlands Police said. The three other suspects -- a man, 36, a woman, 44, and her son, 20, all from Birmingham -- were detained on suspicion of facilitating terrorism overseas, police said. ""All four arrests are connected. They were preplanned and intelligence led. There was no immediate risk to public safety,"" said Det. Superintendent Shaun Edwards of West Midlands Police. Officers are carrying out searches at properties connected to the suspects and vehicles and electronic equipment are being removed for forensic analysis, authorities said. The suspects have not been charged with any offense. Begg was arrested as a suspected al Qaeda member in Pakistan in February 2002 and was held at the U.S. airbase at Bagram, Afghanistan, before being sent to the U.S. prison camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Begg spent nearly three years in custody. He was sent back to Britain by the Bush administration in early 2005 and was never prosecuted. He co-authored a book about his experiences at Guantanamo Bay in 2006 and has appeared as a public speaker and commentator in Britain and overseas since his release.","Police: Moazzam Begg is among four arrested on suspicion of Syria-related offenses .

"(CNN) -- By now, most of us have probably heard that Mitt and Ann Romney paid just under $2 million in taxes on income -- virtually all from investments -- of just under $14 million for 2011, an effective tax rate of 14.1%. This is a low tax rate, lower than the typical middle-class American worker pays, especially when one considers payroll taxes, the largest burden for most Americans. It should concern us that individuals of Romney's wealth -- analysis has put his personal fortune as high as $250 million, not counting some $100 million in trusts set up for his five children -- pay so little as a percent in taxes. It is also correct to note that there appears to be nothing wrong or illegal in the tax returns that Romney released. Sure, there are still many unanswered questions, and speculation and innuendo will no doubt continue. But all of that is beside the point, or ought to be. Romney is really rich. It is what it is. The real attention should be on a tax system that allows the really rich to pay so little in percentage terms and on the best solution to making that tax system better and fairer. Opinion: Republicans risk being the party of mean . The knee-jerk reaction is to raise tax rates, as in the so-called Buffett Rule: Anyone earning more than $1 million should pay an effective rate of at least 30%. If this rule were in place today, it would more than double the Romneys' income taxes. Only, it wouldn't. The Buffett Rule wouldn't work, because really rich Americans do not have to show any ""income"" on their tax returns. The Romneys paid tax because they hold stocks and securities yielding dividends and interest, and because they sold assets generating capital gains. They didn't have to do so. The simple strategy of the super-rich is to buy and hold, and to borrow when needed to finance their lifestyles. Some basic facts: Any tax consists of a base, or what is being taxed, times a rate. The income tax's base is ""income,"" which comes from labor or wealth. Income from labor is hard to hide and easy to tax, as the middle class knows full well. Income from wealth is easy to hide and hard to tax -- and perfectly legally. A non-dividend-paying stock, like Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (or land, artwork, sports franchises), does not have to show any taxable income. People who own such things can be very rich and live very well. If we simply raised tax rates, the super-rich would just as simply stop showing income or selling assets. That's why, under an income tax, we pretty much have to have low rates on investment. Does this strike you as unfair? If you're like most Americans -- i.e., if you're middle class -- then your blood may be boiling at the fact that the super rich seem to be able to hold us all hostage to low tax rates under an income tax. The important question is -- how do we fix this? The answer lies in switching the tax base before we raise the tax rates. Tax spending, rather than work or savings. Then, we could apply a 30% or higher rate to spending at Romney's level. The real inequity shown by the Romneys' tax situation, after all, is measured by the taxes they pay as a percent of their spending or lifestyle. For most Americans, living paycheck to paycheck, spending (after taxes) pretty much equals income (after taxes). It's a good guess that the Romneys are spending a great deal more than the income they are showing on their tax returns. They should be, if they are well-advised (and if they are not well-advised, we have other concerns). What would Romney be spending money on? How about running for president, for one thing. Romney spent $45 million of ""his own"" money running for president in 2008 (less than the $60 million Ross Perot allegedly spent in 1992). I suspect that Romney has spent more of his own money this time around, if only because he has gone further and been more successful in his quest. Opinion: Obama, Romney and your pay . Here is another turn of the screw. Running for president is legally considered a personal expense, nondeductible under the income tax. Such expenses, however, are in essence deductible from another American tax, and the largest single one facing the Romneys: the gift and estate tax. That so-called death tax applies to what is left over on one's deathbed. The simplest way to avoid it is to spend all that you have and die broke. Under current law, Romney's family would have to pay about $80 million in estate taxes after his and Ann's death. If Romney spent $45 million in 2008, at that year's estate tax rate, his family would have saved more than $20 million in taxes because of his presidential run (no need to discount for present value, as the unspent wealth would have appreciated in value). In sum, the government is pitching in, in the form of foregone estate tax revenue, for Romney's and other rich people's presidential runs. It is ironic that the real problem with Romney's personal financial situation is his spending, not his work or savings, and that no one is paying attention to that. Excessive spending at all levels is our national problem, and it is what soon might make us another Greece. No one is paying much attention to that, either. Meantime, we have a tax system set up to encourage spending and borrowing, especially by the rich. The only way to raise taxes under today's income tax is to increase the burdens on working and saving -- just about the last things we should be doing. If we taxed spending, in contrast, the Romneys and other really rich families would see their taxes increase in absolute and percent terms. Yet we oppose consumption or spending taxes because we perceive them as regressive. It's all nearly perfectly perverse, and not a peep on point. Welcome to politics.

"(CNN) -- Experts disagreed Tuesday over whether Amanda Knox is likely to be extradited to Italy, where the country's highest criminal court overturned her acquittal and that of her former boyfriend in the 2007 killing of her roommate, Meredith Kercher. Knox and Raffaele Sollecito were convicted in 2009 of murder in Kercher's death, but a jury overturned the conviction in 2011. She then returned to her home city of Seattle, Washington, where she is studying creative writing at the University of Washington, according to her family's spokesman, David Marriott. A U.S. court or the State Department would be unlikely to take up any extradition request from Italy, said Sean Casey, a former prosecutor who is now a partner at Kobre & Kim in New York. He cited an extradition treaty between the United States and Italy that states: ""Extradition shall not be granted when the person sought has been convicted, acquitted or pardoned, or has served the sentence imposed, by the Requested Party for the same acts for which extradition is requested."" ""Under U.S. law, she was once put in jeopardy and later acquitted,"" Casey said. ""Under the treaty, extradition should not be granted."" In 2011, deputy State Department spokesman Mark Toner told CNN that although the United States and Italy have an extradition treaty, he was not able to answer speculative questions on extradition issues in the Knox case. Tuesday, State Department Acting Deputy Spokesman Patrick Ventrell noted that the matter was ongoing, and the Italian court's full ruling had not been released. ""We can't really comment beyond that,"" he told reporters. ""We never talk about extradition from this podium in terms of individual cases."" Knox may be protected on another level, too, according to Casey. ""Her original verdict was so terribly flawed by prosecutorial overreaching,"" the lawyer said, noting that the appellate court that overturned the original conviction detailed those flaws in a damning report more than 100 pages in length. Timeline: Meredith Kercher murder case . Given those errors, ""I would expect Italian law enforcement to not seek extradition, because it would only prolong this law enforcement ordeal."" But Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz said that Italian prosecutors might very well extradite Knox. And, if retried, she ""likely will be found guilty -- because the evidence supporting a conviction is pretty strong."" Knox, now 25, has established a fan base in the United States ""because she has a beautiful face and an angelic appearance,"" Dershowitz said. ""But remember, she originally admitted she was at the scene of the crime and she tried to blame an innocent man -- for which she was also convicted."" After Knox and Sollecito were detained for questioning in the killing, she allegedly confessed to being at her home when Kercher was killed and implicated Patrick Lumumba, the owner of a bar where she worked. Lumumba was detained, but was released after two weeks when his alibi was corroborated: he had spent the night of the murder talking to a customer in his pub in Perugia, police say. He went on to sue Knox for libel, winning 40,000 euros ($54,000) in damages. Dershowitz said the case was not well tried the first time. ""But at a second trial, there's a very high likelihood that they may very well convict her."" He predicted that Knox would resist any extradition attempt. But even if she were to succeed in that, ""she remains a prisoner in the United States, because Interpol will put a warrant out for her and, if she travels anywhere outside the United States, she'll be immediately arrested and turned over to Italy."" If Knox were to lose an extradition fight and then wind up being convicted, she would go to jail, he said. Amanda Knox: Fascination with 'the evil female' If he were advising Kercher's parents, Dershowitz said, he would recommend that they file a civil suit to claim the money Knox has received as an advance for a book about the case that is scheduled for publication next month. ""They have a right to sue her on behalf of their dead daughter,"" he said, noting that the standard required for conviction in civil cases is a preponderance of the evidence. ""I think that would be easy to do."" And the extradition treaty's reference to double jeopardy may not be binding in some cases, he said. ""In the United States, generally, when you appeal a conviction, you waive your double jeopardy rights, and we permit retrials of people who have had their convictions reversed, at least on procedural grounds,"" he said. And what about Casey's prediction that Italian law enforcement would not seek extradition? ""I think he's wrong,"" Dershowitz said. ""I think the Italian legal system will welcome a second trial. They'll put new prosecutors on the case, good ones, and seek to vindicate themselves."" ""They will want to have a second opportunity to show that Italian justice can be pure."" Dershowitz said purity has also eluded many members of the U.S. news media who have covered the case closely. ""One issue is why the American media portrayed her in such positive terms,"" he said. ""At best, she was a terrible person who tried to blame it on some innocent person and she was clearly a liar, and at worst she participated in a horrible murder, and the American media focused much more on Amanda Knox than on the victim of the case because Amanda Knox was prettier and an American and an American sweetheart."" Had she been ugly, he argued, the case would have attracted little attention. Knox's lawyer, Ted Simon, told CNN that his client was not guilty. ""These charges still remain just as unfounded, just as unjust, as they were before,"" he said. 2011: How the four-year court saga unfolded .","""Extradition should not be granted,"" former prosecutor Sean Casey says .

"(CNN) -- Art has emerged as a major vehicle for expressing the Occupy Wall Street movement. In addition to news this week that street art from Occupy Wall Street and Occupy D.C. was being collected by the Smithsonian National Museum of American History, the movement's Arts and Culture Committee showcased spoken word performances and poetry readings in Manhattan's Zuccotti Park. Elsewhere in the city, a group known as Occupy Museums demonstrated at New York's Museum of Modern Art, the Frick Collection and the New Museum protesting the corporatization of art, and the ""No Comment"" pop-up exhibition similarly represented itself as art inspired by the movement. Then there's the sudden popularity of anti-establishment Guy Fawkes masks, distant kin to the masked protests of the Guerrilla Girls, a collective of anonymous artists who wear Gorilla masks to protest sexism. But perhaps most provocatively, Shepard Fairey -- the artist who famously created the Obama ""Hope"" poster -- contributed ""You Are Invited to the Occupation Party,"" featuring a portrait of a woman evocative of the black power movement, and placing Occupy Wall Street within a deeper history of civil rights protest. Occupy art might just be the movement's most politically potent tool in its dramatic reframing of the racial dynamics of a populist uprising frequently characterized as largely white and ""hippie."" Fairey's ""You Are Invited"" is an especially compelling example. It offers an image of a young black woman with turtleneck sweater and iconic Afro, a la Angela Davis -- the ""uniform"" of the Black Panther Party of the 1960s and '70s. The poster's retro look recalls a militant past, almost startling in our new millennial moment, and surely is meant as a challenge to the idea that as a society we are anywhere near ""post-race"" enlightenment. For evidence of this, we need look no further than the grossly disproportionate use of force by Oakland city police in clearing peaceful Occupy protesters recently. Comedian and social critic Jon Stewart said on his late-night show that the only threat that could possibly warrant such a police response was Godzilla. His comment, though humorous, was seriously spot-on, for the ""beast"" perceived as a threat in that city has long been its black and brown citizens. It is no accident that the Black Panther Party was founded in Oakland, where for decades inequities in health, education, income and incarceration have affected the communities of color there. Indeed, some have called for more black people's involvement in the movement, but Fairey's ""You Are Invited"" goes beyond an appeal for and to black people. Imagine its even more revolutionary effect as a poster carried by people of all backgrounds and social position, symbolically calling for a pan-ethnic alliance. Of course some may complain that this repurposing of black power imagery associates the Occupy movement with a dated and narrow cultural nationalism with no place in our post-civil rights era. The poster's invitation to an ""occupation party"" -- suggesting both a political party as well as a hip, happening event -- may not mobilize a younger generation unfamiliar with appeals to rise up or sit in. Others may criticize the poster as implying a purely token inclusiveness that masks the real tensions between the occupiers' often competing and sometimes confused agenda. These are justifiable concerns. But ""You Are Invited"" is powerful precisely because it invites identification with this long history of marginalized people striving for social and economic equity, however imperfect and unfinished those efforts. More subtly but as importantly, the poster is a mini-tutorial, offering some much needed direction and instruction to a new movement missing some important elements for success. Occupiers are invited to take a page from the past, for instance, and go revolutionary with some style. The Panthers dressed for success and worked their cool look to great political effect. Even more essentially, they also had a plan. The Panthers' Ten-Point Program, which called for ""Land, Bread, Housing, Education, Clothing, Justice and Peace"" and included a successful Free Breakfast for Children program, sought very practical forms of redress (some realistically possible, some less so) to the social and economic injustices they experienced. ""You Are Invited,"" with what we might call its black art of occupation, is a reminder of the historical relationship between art and politics. Plato was anxious about the power of art to rouse emotions and challenge authority, and to be sure, art can be reduced to mere propaganda and demagoguery. But we should not forget that Aristotle, Plato's own student, disagreed with him, insisting that the arts had a profound social function. In 1926, the renowned black intellectual, W.E.B. Du Bois, argued passionately that art should be used for social justice, that beauty can and must be marshaled for a larger good: ""I am one who tells the truth and exposes evil and seeks with beauty and for beauty to set the world right."" Similarly, the ""No Comment"" organizers claim that, ""The purpose of the exhibition is to provide a platform for an open dialogue about serious sociological issues."" Let the Occupy movement's camps and protests and marches continue generating such art -- art that inspires interracial unity where it may not yet exist, art that reminds us of the voices unheard, art that galvanizes practical social change when nothing seems to give, art that, in Du Bois' words, tries to make the world both beautiful and right. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michele Elam.","Michele Elam says art is emerging as potent tool of Occupy Wall Street movement .

"Washington (CNN) -- A former Navy officer who has crossed paths with a Malaysian businessman at the center of the U.S. Navy bribery scandal says he can understand how those implicated were seduced by Leonard ""Fat Leonard"" Francis. ""He's a larger-than-life individual. He's charming. He's very social,"" said retired Navy Capt. Kevin Eyer, who was commanding officer of a ship that frequented the same ports where Francis operated and attended some of his parties. ""Whereas I might be at this party and drinking a Budweiser, Leonard is having Dom Perignon."" Francis, whose nickname around the Navy comes from his 400-pound heft, operates Singapore-based Glenn Defense Marine Asia Ltd., which provides services to Navy ships such as fuel and tugboats to nudge ships into port. Three Navy officials have been arrested and are accused of accepting cash, hookers and all-expense paid trips in exchange for steering ships to ports where Francis' company operates. Third Navy official arrested in bribery case . Two admirals in charge of Navy intelligence -- Vice Adm. Ted Branch and Rear Adm. Bruce Loveless -- have had their access to classified material suspended. Neither Branch nor Loveless has been charged but CNN is told that allegations have been made about their ""personal conduct."" Cmdr. Michael Vannak Khem Misiewicz and Naval Criminal Investigative Service Supervisory Special Agent John Bertrand Beliveau II were arrested in probes involving Francis' company in September. Cmdr. Jose Luis Sanchez, 41, was arrested last week in Florida. Francis, Sanchez, Misiewicz and Beliveau are charged with conspiring to commit bribery and could face up to five years in prison if convicted. All have pleaded not guilty. Intelligence chiefs suspended . Neither Branch nor Loveless, who are on temporary leave, has been charged with any crime or violation and both retain their ranks and security clearances, said Rear Adm. John Kirby, chief of Navy information. They are on temporary leave. Their suspension was deemed prudent given the sensitive nature of the admirals' current duties and to protect the integrity of the investigative process, Kirby said. The allegations against Branch and Loveless involve conduct before their current assignments and flag officer ranks, Kirby said. The Naval Criminal Investigative Service initiated the investigation in 2010. Federal prosecutors allege Sanchez, as deputy logistics officer in the U.S. 7th Fleet and later as the Fleet Logistics Command's operations director, directed Navy business and sensitive information to Francis' company. In return, Francis allegedly gave Sanchez more than $100,000, travel expenses and prostitutes during a period covering January 2009 to April 2013. Court documents say Sanchez allegedly asked Francis for pictures of prostitutes for ""motivation."" A few days later, Sanchez sent a Facebook message to Francis saying, ""Yummy ... Daddy like."" Prosecutors say Misiewicz, 46, as deputy operations officer of the U.S. 7th Fleet, helped schedule visits of U.S. Navy ships to ports where Francis' company worked and Francis allegedly overbilled the government for its work. In return, Francis provided Misiewicz with paid travel, luxury hotel stays, tickets to ""The Lion King"" in Tokyo and a Lady Gaga concert in Thailand and prostitutes, the U.S. attorney's office said. 'We got him!!' The government says Francis and Misiewicz became close friends over private e-mail, calling each other ""Big Bro"" and ""Little Bro."" Prosecutors say that after Misiewicz received some gifts, a Francis associate declared, ""We got him!!"" A separate complaint alleges Beliveau, 44, provided Francis with information about an NCIS fraud investigation into his company's dealings with the Navy. ""In exchange, Francis provided Beliveau with, among other things, paid travel, luxury hotel stays and prostitution services,"" the U.S. attorney's office said. No evidence was found that Beliveau paid for his hotel or travel, or that he reimbursed Francis for the trip. Francis also arranged for a female escort to entertain Beliveau while there, according to the complaint. In return, Francis allegedly saved 125 NCIS investigative reports to his government computer. The affidavit states the reports were in connection with the investigation into Francis' company. By all accounts, Francis lived life large -- from fast cars to women to travel. ""I think it would be fair to say that they were seduced by Mr. Francis,"" Eyer said. ""You can kind of see how if you fell into the mode of socializing with him, it would be possible to get swept up in that. That's why so many military officers are little bit wary about him.""

"(CNN) -- A long awaited night out at a Lady Gaga concert turned into a nightmare for a 33-year-old  Tennessee woman, whose heart was restarted after stopping for five minutes when she went into cardiac arrest. Crystal Thornton, from Lyles, Tennessee, was enjoying the concert's opening act at the  Bridgestone Arena in Nashville with her best friend Christina Tugman on Tuesday night when she had a seizure, according to information provided by Vanderbilt Medical Center. ""She stopped breathing, her eyes rolled back in her head, and her body started twitching,"" Tugman said. ""I was asking if she was OK, and she wasn't responding."" Tugman ran to the lobby to get help. It took Jerry Jones, an  EMT supervisor with Vanderbilt University's LifeFlight Event Medicine  program, one minute more to reach her. ""The patient was unconscious with no heartbeat,""  Jones said. Using a portable  automated external defibrillator, Jones and other paramedics spent more  than five minutes until they were finally able to get Thornton's heart beating again. She was then airlifted to  Vanderbilt Medical Center's emergency department, where doctors  immediately used therapeutic hypothermia to cool Thornton's body temperature to between 93 and  86 degrees -- below the normal body temperature of 98.6 degrees. Even though her heart was working again, doctors wanted to slow circulation in order to prevent the death of brain cells -- and, therefore, brain damage -- caused by prolonged lack of oxygen. Chilled water blankets were placed over Thornton's body and head, and medical personnel then used a machine to lower her body  temperature for 48 hours. ""The patient  received incredible care from the moment she experienced problems at the  Bridgestone Arena,"" said Dr. Jared McKinney, medical director of LifeFlight  Event Medicine. ""It is only through a coordinated team effort that her  successful outcome was possible."" After undergoing the two days of cooling therapy, Thornton's body temperature was slowly restored to normal. She regained consciousness and neurologically continues to improve, according to her doctors in Nashville. On Friday afternoon, she was in stable condition, the Tennessee hospital said. Her cardiologist, Dr. John McPherson, said that Thornton is undergoing a battery of tests to determine why she suffered the heart attack. He told CNN it appears she has an enlarged heart -- ""a genetic condition that, unfortunately, has no warning symptoms and often results in an emergency situation like Thornton experienced."" Next week, she will have surgery to put an implantable cardioverter defibrillator in her chest. The device sends electrical shocks that will automatically kick in if her heart starts beating irregularly and restore it to normal, in hopes of preventing another heart attack. Leigh Sims, an emergency medical technician and Vanderbilt's manager of event medicine, said the defibrillator saved the woman's life. ""Without an AED, this patient would not have  survived,"" Sims said. ""It restored her pulse."" While she's thankful, it's all a blur for Thornton. And she hasn't gotten over not being able to see Lady Gaga strut and sing on stage. ""I am so mad I missed the  concert,"" she said, according to a statement released by the hospital. Tugman said Friday that she's grateful to have her friend back -- including after another scare Thursday night, when ""all of a sudden she stopped breathing, her eyes rolled back and all those machines started going off."" ""They came in and shocked her, and she came right back,"" said Tugman.","NEW: The woman's friend says she had another seizure Thursday, and was saved again .

"(CNN) -- Syria becomes a greater emergency with each passing day. This week Defense Minister Daoud Rajiha and other members of President Bashar al-Assad's inner circle were murdered; opposition groups claimed responsibility. Last week Nawaf al-Fares, Syria's ambassador to Iraq, resigned from the government and joined the opposition, and the government's militiamen apparently shot villagers in Tremseh at close range. There is growing consensus across the American political spectrum that al-Assad must go, that opposition forces must be armed in order to contend for political power, and that the situation in Syria is a strategic issue for the United States and its allies. On the Senate floor earlier this year, Sen. John McCain spoke for many analysts when he discussed the strategic significance of Syria: ""The end of the Assad regime would sever Hezbollah's lifeline to Iran, eliminate a long-standing threat to Israel, bolster Lebanon's sovereignty and independence, and inflict a strategic defeat on the Iranian regime. It would be a geopolitical success of the first order."" The humanitarian dimension of Syria's crisis is underscored by reports claiming that anywhere from 10,000 to 20,000 people have been killed there in the past 17 months of violence. Falling prey to election-year politicking, President Barack Obama, Gov. Mitt Romney, and their campaign surrogates eschew frank discussion of Syria and its implications -- to answer hard questions about sacrificing life and spending treasure abroad in yet another Middle East battlefield is to open up political risks that cannot be calculated. That's why it is worth recalling events of the early 1980s and former Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger's national security doctrine. On June 6, 1982, Israel, seeking to relieve pressure on its northern borders by dismantling the Palestine Liberation Organization's base of operation, invaded Lebanon, a country beset by civil war and Syrian occupation. Soon thereafter, France, Italy and the United States formed a multinational force to help stabilize the country -- as differing factions of Arabs and Christians as well as the Israelis and Syrians were in a tangled web of conflict -- and allow PLO fighters to leave the country. The PLO withdrawal was completed by August 30, and the MNF departed on September 10, but the story did not end there. The MNF failed to stabilize Lebanon. President-elect Bashir Gemayel was killed in his Phalange party headquarters on September 14. In the days that followed, Israeli forces stood by as Lebanese Phalangists massacred Palestinians in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps, an act of retribution for the assassination of Gemayel, which may, in fact, have been undertaken by pro-Syrian forces. A few days later, Bashir's brother Amin was elected president, and the MFN re-entered Beirut. On October 23, 1983, a suicide bomber drove a truck into the U.S. Marine barracks at the Beirut airport, and France's barracks also were struck by a suicide bomb -- 241 U.S. servicemen and nearly 60 French soldiers were killed. It was the single bloodiest day for the Marines since the battle of Iwo Jima in 1945. Between December 1983 and February 1984, U.S. battleships retaliated against combatants who had targeted the MNF. The USS New Jersey undertook a relentless counterattack against Syrian and Druze forces, shooting its 16-inch guns for the first time since the Vietnam War. By April, the entire MNF, which the United Kingdom had joined, had left Lebanon. The civil war continued until 1990. President Reagan supported Secretary of State George Shultz's arguments in favor of U.S. diplomacy and peacekeeping in Lebanon. But in Weinberger's view, Lebanon was the wrong fight for the United States. In a speech on November 28, 1984, he articulated his six principles for future U.S. military engagements: . (1) There should be no commitment of U.S. forces abroad unless there is a clear and vital interest for the United States or its allies; (2) Combat, if agreed upon, should be undertaken with the intention of military victory, using whatever forces and resources are needed to achieve that goal; (3) Political and military objectives must be clearly defined before entering a conflict; (4) The relationship between military means and diplomatic, military, and political objectives ""must be continually reassessed and adjusted if necessary,"" not just established at the beginning of the military engagement; (5) No battle is worth fighting or will be successful without ""reasonable assurance we will have the support of the American people"" and Congress; and (6) The commitment of U.S. troops to a conflict should be an act of last resort. The Reagan administration had approved Israel's invasion of Lebanon, and although initially welcomed by many Muslims in Lebanon the United States came to be seen as too pro-Israel, pro-Christian, and anti-Muslim. U.S. forces' unintentional shelling of civilians did not help matters. Furthermore, the re-entry of the MFN was not accompanied by a serious understanding of strategy, objectives and the relationship between them. So President Reagan decided to withdraw U.S. forces from what would likely become a major military quagmire for the United States, instead of a multinational peacekeeping operation. That caution brings us back to Syria, where the crisis is beginning to meet Weinberger's criteria on objectives: get al-Assad to leave. But means and strategies are very much in flux. The call for a U.S.-led international coalition of the willing to help the Syrian opposition is one suggested military and diplomatic strategy, but how realistic is it in the near term, or pre-Election Day? Weinberger's principles remind us that the situation in Syria is difficult for the United States because calibrating means and ends in the maelstrom is easier said than done. Perhaps the humanitarian crisis that Syria has become will help settle the matter. But, as Weinberger declared, the United States should ""not assign a combat mission to a force configured for peacekeeping."" Translation: Lebanon must not happen again.

"(CNN) -- The battleground of words is a place all mothers of daughters will find themselves. The day that sweet little face looks at you with complete defiance challenging every mother bone in your body, you need to be prepared for the inevitable event. I'm here with a little advice for the brave ladies who are taking on the most difficult job in the world, raising daughters. It is in the arena of words that the job will be done well. So, here are three effective mother-daughter communication tips that can absolutely bring success. The first: As a mother it is your place to defuse, not to ignite. In the world of females there is a wonderful trait we each possess: That quality is called tenacity. So when we engage with our daughters, we find that characteristic at work. We ask, they respond, we respond, they respond, we react, they react and on and on, with both mother and daughter determined to have the last word. Mom, you've got to keep your ""feminine side"" under control. State your position in a reasoned and controlled way, on expectations and consequences. Then the tenacity you must employ is to stick to it without igniting a firestorm. There will be days you just have to end the confrontation by declaring that each of you will go to your separate corners. I would enter mine, which was usually my bedroom, and stick my head in my pillow. This was to effectively muffle the muted screams of a frustrated mom. After emotionally declaring every word that I wanted to say to my daughter into that bundle of polyester stuffing, I would gather my wits. Leaving my room with my calm and controlled face I re-entered the arena to successfully complete the conversation. The second tip all mothers must remember is to listen. Our goal is to be great mothers, not perfect mothers, so this means (this may come as a surprise) we are not always right. We don't possess perfect understanding of all circumstances and even our rules may at times need revision. So mom, listen when your daughter is struggling with math and only wants to create art projects. She may be revealing her talents. Listen when you have adamantly declared no way is she doing that (whatever that may be), when you find out you misinterpreted her intent or the circumstances she was entering. Listen when she wants to bend her curfew rules because she has a world premier movie to see after she gets off work, but to safely deposit her friends to their homes will make her late. She does have a job, mom; it's a good time to be persuaded. Really listen when her dreams take her to a college or a city that seems so far away and terribly dangerous. She may be on the life course destined for her and your fears should not be what hold her back. With this understanding, allow your daughter to express her frustrations, feelings and desires. Having her present a valid viewpoint stated in a calm and reasoned manner is a healthy exercise for both mother and daughter. Let her make her case and truly listen. You want your daughter to be persuasive when she is right, so allow yourself to be persuaded, too. The last but most important tip is your daughter will be more attentive to your words if she knows you believe in her. This is demonstrated best in the times you are simply living life. Tell her she has abilities and talents and she will work to develop them. Tell her you are proud of her choices and she will make better ones. Tell her you trust her and she will do her best to be trustworthy. If you tell her something is too hard for her, she will believe it. If you say she can accomplish anything, she will believe that, too. As Pablo Picasso said: ""When I was a child my mother said to me 'If you become a soldier, you'll be a general. If you become a monk you'll end up as the pope.' Instead I became a painter and wound up as Picasso."" Award show acceptance speeches, dinner conversation and Mother's Day cards all tell of the impact we moms can have on our daughters. So, when you get into the inevitable argument, defuse, don't ignite. Teach her to defend and persuade. And tell that daughter of yours she can indeed be anything she dreams. Your daughter may be the general, the artist or even the president. Then finally, on those days when all else fails, it is still permissible to look down at that defiant face and say, as mothers throughout time have, ""You will do it because I am the mom and I said so."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Darlene Brock.","Darlene Brock has learned that all daughters try to win battles of words .

Remember: Moms are great, not perfect. So listen to daughter -- she might be right .
As last resort: ""You will do it because I am the mom and I said so"""
"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama told a Labor Day crowd in Detroit that he's prepared to fight for a new job growth plan, defend organized labor and take steps to ""restore the middle class in America,"" while five Republican candidates hoping to defeat him next year all called for repealing the major legislation passed so far in Obama's presidency. The Republican presidential candidates participating in the Palmetto Freedom Forum in Columbia, South Carolina, which was televised on CNN, were unified in advocating the end of the health care reform law and the Wall Street reform measure passed by a Democratic-led Congress. They also all expressed strong anti-abortion views and their belief in marriage being between a man and a woman at the event set up by Sen. Jim DeMint, a leading tea party conservative. Meanwhile, in the early primary states of New Hampshire and South Carolina, other Republican presidential contenders ripped Obama's handling of the economy and pledged to take an economically battered America in a new direction marked by less spending and fewer regulations. The sharply differing visions raised new questions about the ability of top Democrats and Republicans to tackle pressing budgetary and other issues while positioning themselves for what promises to be a bitterly contested campaign next year. In a speech that likely previewed his scheduled address Thursday to a joint session of Congress to present a jobs plan, Obama directly challenged Republicans, whom he has accused of obstructing progress in order to score political points. ""These are tough times for working Americans,"" Obama told the union-dominated crowd at a rally that included a warm-up from Aretha Franklin. ""The time for Washington games is over. The time for action is now."" Saying American workers were ready to move ahead, he said, ""We just need Congress to get on board"" and later added: ""We will see if congressional members will put country before party."" ""We will give them a plan and then we will see if they want to create jobs,"" the president said. Obama took credit for a series of controversial measures, including the health care overhaul, financial regulatory reform, the 2009 economic stimulus plan and the auto industry bailout. ""I've seen Detroit prove the cynics and the naysayers wrong,"" he said, referring to the U.S. auto industry. ""We're fighting for good jobs with good wages ... (and) an economy where hard work pays off and gaming the system doesn't work."" The president quoted a 1948 Labor Day speech delivered by President Harry Truman in Detroit. Like Obama, Truman ran for re-election that year against a largely hostile Republican-dominated Congress. ""The gains of labor were not accomplished at the expense of the rest of the nation,"" Obama said, quoting Truman. ""Labor's gains contributed to the rest of the nation's prosperity."" Before Obama spoke, James Hoffa, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, blasted congressional Republicans and urged the crowd to mobilize and help defeat the GOP at the polls in 2012. ""Everybody here has a vote,"" Hoffa said. ""Keep the eye on the prize. Let's take these sons of bitches out and give America back to an America where we belong."" As Obama rallied Democratic base voters in Michigan, Vice President Joe Biden headed to Cincinnati to attend an AFL-CIO Labor Day event. The AFL-CIO is a federation of 56 national and international labor unions. Obama carried Michigan and Ohio in 2008, but both states, hit hard by the economic downturn, could prove challenging to keep in the Democratic column in 2012. The Republican forum in DeMint's home state of South Carolina, meanwhile, gave five of the top GOP candidates a chance to explain their stances on key issues to conservatives. DeMint's endorsement is one of the most sought after among 2012 GOP White House hopefuls, and his support would be a major boost for any Republican candidate in his home state's pivotal early primary. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney initially declined DeMint's invitation, saying he was concentrating on campaigning in New Hampshire, which holds an even earlier primary. But after falling behind newcomer Texas Gov. Rick Perry in some polls, Romney apparently changed his mind, opting to wrap up a pancake breakfast event in New Hampshire before traveling to Columbia for DeMint's forum. ""The tea party is a powerful movement saying government's too big, and I couldn't agree more,"" Romney told a crowd of roughly 450 people at the breakfast. In addition to Romney, Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, businessman Herman Cain, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Rep. Ron Paul of Texas attended the DeMint forum. All cited the Declaration of Independence and its determination of God-given rights for citizens as the foundation of American government in a recitation of core conservative principles championed by the tea party movement. Perry was also slated to take part in DeMint's forum but backed out Monday morning to return to Texas as it battles growing wildfires. Perry did, however, participate in GOP Rep. Tim Scott's town hall series in Conway, South Carolina, before returning home. While in Conway, Perry sharply criticized Romney's job growth record in Massachusetts. ""There's one (GOP candidate) ... that's created jobs all over the world,"" Perry said, referring to Romney's oft-mentioned record in the private sector. ""But while he was the governor of Massachusetts, he didn't create very many jobs. ""We cannot choose a nominee ... that is going to blur the lines,"" Perry added. The GOP needs ""someone who has a very stark difference (with) the president of the United States ... and I would suggest to you I'm that person."" Two other candidates not appearing at the event were also on the campaign trail Monday. Former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman, drawing new attention after announcing his economic plan last week, wrapped up five days of events in New Hampshire with a parade and a picnic, and former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania held three events in South Carolina. Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who has not announced whether she will run for president, was in New Hampshire on Labor Day after three days in Iowa. ""We're up against ... Barack Obama's very strange fundamental transformation of the country that we so love,"" Palin said. ""We don't need a transformation. As you know, we need a fundamental restoration of all that is good and strong and free in America."" CNN's Alan Silverleib, Shawna Shepherd, Tom Cohen and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.","NEW: Obama challenges congressional Republicans to work with him on creating jobs .

"(CNN) -- Fashion is loud in America's Music City. Blogger Heidi Jewell, who's lived in Nashville for two years, said street trendsetters pair haute couture with cowboy boots, band tees with designer bags. Her website, Under the Guise, puts a spotlight on eclectic, innovative looks inspired by the arts. San Francisco style . ""[Nashville] is packed with designers, filmmakers, musicians and artists hailing from cities all around the world, each bringing their own sense of style along with them,"" she said. ""It strikes a perfect balance between staying true to its heritage while maintaining a youthful, modern culture that keeps reinventing itself."" The city's first official Fashion Week, which commenced Tuesday, showcases local collections alongside national lines, including Betsey Johnson, Christian Sirianao and Gustavo Cadile. It's all part of Nashville's genre-bending melting pot. Below, Jewell explains street style. CNN: What influences fashion in Nashville? Jewell: It goes without saying that the music industry definitely plays a part in the overall style. Of course, country music has an impact (which rocks and I would like to see more of it). But a lot of people don't know there's an amazing indie/rock community here as well. Brilliant local musicians playing in tucked-away historic venues and residential basements are influencing looks inspired by '40s military, '80s club and British punk while standing shoulder to shoulder with Southern Belles sporting vintage summer dresses perfectly complimented by their favorite pair of worn in cowboy boots. Boise street style . CNN: What styles are popular right now? Jewell: It's hard to put my finger on a specific look that seems dominant, but mixing in vintage pieces is very popular among the people I photograph. There are some great thrift stores and locally owned boutiques that offer affordable one-of-a-kind Southern pieces scattered all throughout the city. You could compare Nashville to L.A. in the sense that a large majority of people who move here have come in hopes of breaking into the entertainment industry. The end result is a community of aspiring artists and service professionals who have a more eclectic sense of style than you would expect from people serving you cocktails or manning the register at your favorite local record shop. CNN: What do people wear on a night out? Jewell: Weekend nights have been a bit more on the grunge side lately. Black-and-white striped tops, muscle tees, biker jackets, denim or leather vests, fur jackets. Converse All-Stars, ropers and Beatle boots. Whether it's a fedora or something more summery, hats are staple pieces as well. CNN: Where do you shop in Nashville? Jewell: I would have to say my top picks for clothing are Goodbuy Girls and Local Honey. For shoes, I'm a big fan of the locally run Etsy shops, Granny's Bootery and Reanimated Rags. For accessories, I like Pangaea. CNN: How can fashionistas on a budget look great? Jewell: Thrift! Or learn how to sew. How do people dress in your city?

"(CNN) -- A Georgia man was sentenced to six months in federal prison on charges of sexually assaulting a sleeping passenger during a flight from Dallas to Atlanta, federal authorities said Tuesday. FBI agents arrested Ranchhodbhai Lakha of Alpharetta, Georgia, on October 4, 2010, after a 20-year-old woman filed a complaint about being inappropriately touched on the Delta flight. According to the federal indictment, the woman said she awoke during the trip to discover the 61-year-old former hotel owner touching her below the waist. She removed his hand and told him to stop, documents said. Lakha responded by asking her, ""Is that OK -- you don't like that?"" according to the complaint. The woman said no and recoiled her body to protect herself, but Lakha reached down and touched her again, the indictment alleged. After the woman got up and reported the assault to a flight attendant, authorities arrested Lakha on a federal criminal complaint of sexual assault. ""This defendant thought he could get away with taking advantage of a defenseless, sleeping passenger sitting next to him.  He was wrong.  He will now serve time in a federal prison,"" U.S. Attorney Sally Quillian Yates said Tuesday. Lakha pleaded guilty to a charge of abusive sexual contact on June 29, 2011. In addition to serving six months in prison, he must serve one year of supervised release, and was fined $5,000. Lakha also is required to register as a sex offender.","Georgia man convicted of sexual assault of sleeping passenger .

"(Mental Floss) -- 1. Cordless tools . Your life may be safer and more comfortable because of inventions that came from space research. As long as NASA was going to the trouble of sending Apollo astronauts to the moon, it figured it might as well equip them with drills and ask them to dig up rock samples when they got there. But realizing that a 239,000-mile extension cord would be impractical, NASA teamed up with Black & Decker to develop tools that featured rechargeable batteries and special low-power consumption motors, which should make your DustBuster seem a lot more impressive. 2. Smoke detectors . In the 1970s, NASA partnered with Honeywell Corp. to create a device that would detect smoke and toxic gases in Skylab, America's first space station. The result was the first ionization smoke detector, using a minute amount of the radioactive isotope Americium-241. This led to the 1979 introduction of inexpensive photoelectric detection devices, which go off when smoke (or sometimes a hot, steamy shower) blocks the light beam. To date, smoke detectors have saved countless lives here on Earth, but they're especially useful in space, where running outside to wait for the fire truck isn't an option. 3. Enriched baby food . NASA-sponsored research has also helped make major improvements to commercially available baby food, and we're not talking about freeze-dried strained peas. While testing the potential of algae as a food supply for long-duration space travel, a Maryland-based biosciences company discovered an algae additive that contains two fatty acids closely resembling those found in human breast milk. The company now uses it to make an enriched infant formula called Formulaid, thought to be essential for babies' visual and mental development. 4. New-age pavement . When you buy a new set of tires, the old ones have to go somewhere, right? Most of them end up in huge, flammable tire dumps, which may hold millions of old tires, each one containing about a quart of oil in the rubber. If a dump catches fire, however, it can burn with a thick, toxic smoke for weeks on end. But today, old tires are being put to good use. NASA's experience in fuel-related cryogenics helped develop processes to freeze the tires to below -200 degrees Fahrenheit so that they crumble, separating the rubber from other materials and producing what's called ""crumb."" This waste is recycled into several new products, including an ingredient used to pave highways, which means your new radial tires may someday be rolling over your old ones. 5. Those cool ear thermometers . Any parent knows you don't take a baby's temperature by sticking a glass thermometer in its mouth, but inserting it the other way isn't much fun, either. And what about the incapacitated patient who can't even say ""aaah""? The Diatek Corp. of California wanted a safer way to take a person's temperature, and who better to turn to than NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the place with over 30 years of experience using infrared sensors to remotely observe celestial bodies? Together, they developed a fast and accurate thermometer that, when its disposable probe cover (to prevent cross-infection) is inserted into the ear canal, detects infrared radiation from the eardrum and gives a digital readout in less than two seconds. 6. Fast-acting dental braces . Do your old-fashioned braces set off airport metal detectors? Save yourself embarrassing strip searches by getting new ones. Many orthodontists now use ceramic braces that are bonded to the teeth and strung together with a thin, light wire made of NiTinol (nickel-titanium), an alloy brought to you compliments of NASA. Because of its amazing ability to maintain its original shape, NiTi (as it's known in the industry) provides space satellites with the ability to spring open after being cramped and contorted inside a rocket. But don't think its capabilities are limited to space. When used in dental appliances, NiTi exerts a continuous force against the teeth to move in the right direction, eliminating the need for wire tightening, thus reducing a patient's overall time in braces ... and much of the pain. 7. Protective paint . What do the Statue of Liberty, a gigantic Buddha in Hong Kong and the Golden Gate Bridge all have in common? They're protected by the American space program ... sort of. In the late 1980s, NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center began a research program to develop coatings for the Kennedy Space Center in Florida to shield the launch structures from salt-air corrosion, rocket exhaust and thermal stress. Applications of this material proved ideal for protecting structures like bridges, antenna towers and the occasional big Buddha. 8. (Better) cardiac pacemakers . Pacemakers have come a long way since their invention in 1950. Far from the large, external contraptions used early on, modern pacemakers can self-adjust in most cases and even activate themselves when needed. But one of the most significant advances in pacemaker technology came in the 1970s, with the help of a NASA-developed system of communication called bi-directional telemetry, originally used to communicate with satellites. Siemens-Pacesetter, Inc. teamed with NASA to develop a similar telemetry system, which not only allows doctors to make changes to the unit's function over time, but also updates them on how the device is interacting with the patient -- all without picking up a scalpel. 9. Scratch-resistant glasses . Thanks to NASA technology, plastic lenses for glasses last up to 10 times longer than they used to. That's because its Ames Research Center created a scratch-resistant (read: extremely hard) coating to protect equipment from getting beaten up by space debris. Later, the Foster Grant Corp. acquired the license for the coating method and used it in their plastic sunglasses, which matched the hardness of glass lenses, but were much lighter. Among other uses, it's now employed in most eyewear and industrial face shields. 10. Oh-so comfy sneaker insoles . Can't run a five-minute mile? Don't blame your sneakers. If they're relatively new, they're probably giving you quite a bit of help already. In the 1970s, many shoe manufacturers began replacing their standard foam rubber insoles with a new, highly shock-absorbent material -- one giant step for tennis shoes. The new kicks were padded with ""viscoelastic"" bubbles that conformed to your foot and then returned to their normal shape when you took the shoes off. Turns out, they got the idea (and the technology) from NASA, which had developed the material to better cushion astronauts during blastoff. And one pop culture killer . Despite popular theory, NASA did NOT invent Tang orange breakfast drink for the astronauts. It was introduced in 1957 by General Foods and was on grocery store shelves for years before NASA decided it worked well in space. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- As rooms go, it's quite nice. It's shaped like an egg. It has a well-tended garden a few feet out the door, and then an expanse of lawn leading to a fence. It is certainly not the most ornate or luxurious room in the United States. Most five-star hotels have suites that out-glitter it. Any number of corporate CEOs boast offices that are larger and more lavishly outfitted. But the Oval Office at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington has always been the object of a singular kind of yearning. Mitt Romney fervently wants to move into it in January; Barack Obama just as fervently wants not to move out. This fall's presidential campaign, which begins in earnest with the Republican National Convention this week, will determine whether it will be Romney or Obama who gets his wish.

Campaigns go by so quickly, and unfold so feverishly, that the combatants can be excused for not dwelling on the fact that each successive occupant of the Oval Office is, by definition, a transient. It's temporary work, the presidency, and the Oval Office is the traditional home of the most high-level temps in the world. I've been looking at two pieces of Oval Office video, each mesmerizing, even astonishing, in its own way. Neither was originally intended for public consumption. Each stars a man who is in his final weeks -- or in one case final hours -- as president. One of the men knows it. The other has no idea. The first video consists of outtakes from an interview that Chet Huntley and David Brinkley of NBC News conducted with President John F. Kennedy on September 9, 1963. Huntley and Brinkley were at the apex of their fame and journalistic influence; their evening newscast, ""The Huntley-Brinkley Report,"" was expanding from 15 to 30 minutes, and Kennedy had agreed to tape the Oval Office interview to launch the longer show. The main interview had concluded. But on the tape, Kennedy tells Huntley and Brinkley that he is dissatisfied with some of the answers he gave them. He wants to do them over. ""There's one or two places we're a little ragged,"" he says to the newsmen. And then, to be certain Huntley and Brinkley understand what he is asking for: . ""Let's try and do it again and we'll see what comes out this time."" They accede; they redo the questions. And what comes across most strongly in the footage is the complete aura of command that Kennedy projects in that White House office. He appears filled with the Oval Office's inherent power and authority, and betrays not a smidgen of doubt that, for him, all of that will likely go on. Neither Kennedy, nor Huntley and Brinkley, could have had any inkling that within 12 weeks he would be dead in Dallas, that the two newsmen would be covering his funeral, and that Lyndon Johnson, not he, would be sitting in this office. In the outtakes, Kennedy gives Brinkley advice on whether a new Cary Grant-Audrey Hepburn movie is worth seeing; Kennedy seems supremely at home and at ease in that room. Leaving it looks to be the furthest thing from his mind. The other piece of videotape features a president who knows that, within 24 hours, he will be leaving the Oval Office, and the presidency, ahead of schedule. Most of us have seen Richard Nixon's resignation speech from the evening of August 8, 1974. But, in the five minutes before he addressed the nation, there was some calibrating of lights and checking of sound levels. Nixon was in the chair behind his desk for that. And it was all being recorded. Through the amalgam of overwhelming emotions that had to have been coursing through him -- he knew what he would be saying to the citizens of the United States a few minutes later -- Nixon grins. It is as if he does not want the technicians to see his anguish . To an assistant who, for purposes of lighting adjustments, is sitting in the president's chair behind the Oval Office desk as Nixon enters the room, Nixon says: ""Hey, you're better lookin' than I am. Why don't you stay here?"" To the person operating the television camera: ""Have you got an extra camera in case the lights go out?"" It's banter, in a dark American hour. He sit behind his desk and says: ""All Secret Service, are there any Secret Service in the room? Out."" He gets no response, and because the camera is focused on Nixon we don't see the Secret Service agents. But it is clear that they do not depart, because Nixon says in their direction: . ""You don't have to stay, do you?"" Then: . ""You're required to?"" Finally: . ""I'm just kidding you."" It is a difficult video to watch, because the moments are so raw. In its own way, it is even more revelatory than the resignation speech itself. Here is a man who worked all his life to make it to this room, and now he -- as Kennedy, in a very different context, did before him -- is leaving it earlier than he thought he would have to. Kennedy and Nixon may be the stars of those videos, but the real star is the room itself -- it is the one aspect of the videos that is sustaining and permanent. Mitt Romney and Barack Obama will battle all fall for the symbolic key to that room, even while knowing that, in the end, it will stop being theirs. Presidents depart; the Oval Office remains. Which may be at the heart of the lure that has made so many people over the centuries hunger to be there, for however brief or long a stay. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: Oval Office for some the most coveted room in the nation; however transient .

"(Mental Floss) -- Sean Connery wasn't supposed to be James Bond. Keanu Reeves wasn't supposed to be ""The One."" So, who were the original choices? ""I would have absolutely messed up 'The Matrix,'"" Will Smith told Wired about turning down the role of Neo. Here are 5 actors and the legendary roles they turned down: . 1. THE ROLE: James Bond in ""Dr. No"" WHO LET IT GET AWAY: Cary Grant . Despite being Bond producer Albert Broccoli's best man, Grant said, ""I don't"" to the offer, and Sean Connery got the role instead. Of course, many studio executives objected to the decision, and even Bond creator Ian Fleming said Connery ""wasn't exactly what I had in mind."" REGRETTABILITY METER: Low . By the 1960s, Cary Grant already had a spectacular film career. If he'd accepted the role (as Broccoli later revealed), it would've been just a one-movie deal. Mental Floss: Name that 007 tune . 2. THE ROLE: Neo in ""The Matrix"" WHO LET IT GET AWAY: Will Smith turned it down to star in the forgettable action flick ""Wild Wild West,"" and the part went to Reeves. REGRETTABILITY METER: Low . In an interview with Wired, Smith said, ""I would have absolutely messed up 'The Matrix.' At that point I wasn't smart enough as an actor to let the movie be -- whereas Keanu was."" 3. THE ROLE: Vincent Vega in ""Pulp Fiction"" WHO LET IT GET AWAY: Michael Madsen, who was stuck in lengthy rehearsals for ""Wyatt Earp."" John Travolta got the role instead and, almost overnight, transformed from a Hollywood has-been into one of the most bankable stars in the business. REGRETTABILITY METER: High . Madsen called ""Wyatt Earp"" a ""big waste of time."" Mental Floss: Kim Jong Il, the director he kidnapped, and the awful Godzilla film they made together . 4. THE ROLE: Gandalf in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy . WHO LET IT GET AWAY: Sean Connery, who'd never read the J.R.R. Tolkien series and claimed he ""didn't understand the script."" (Can you say karma?) REGRETTABILITY METER: High . In return for playing the role, New Line Cinema offered the Scottish actor up to 15 percent of worldwide box office receipts, which would have earned Connery more than any actor had ever been paid for a single role -- as much as $400 million. 5. THE ROLES: Sundance in ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,"" Jimmy ""Popeye"" Doyle in ""The French Connection,"" and Captain Benjamin Willard in ""Apocalypse Now"" WHO LET THEM GET AWAY: Steve McQueen . REGRETTABILITY METER: Tragically high . McQueen turned down the role of Sundance simply because costar Paul Newman refused to give him top billing. Later, McQueen declined the lead in ""The French Connection"" because he felt the part was too similar to the tough cop he'd played in 1968's ""Bullitt."" Gene Hackman took the part and won an Oscar for it. And finally, in 1978, McQueen told ""Apocalypse Now"" director Francis Ford Coppola to shove off when he was offered the lead. McQueen's non-negotiable asking price was $3 million; plus, he didn't feel like spending four months shooting in the Philippine jungle. Instead, Martin Sheen landed the role, and despite suffering a heart attack during the stressful production, he gave one of cinema's greatest performances.

"(CNN) -- Matthew Sudders has been on plenty of cruises, but he'd never seen anything like this. The civil servant from Paris was aboard the Carnival Paradise on Tuesday when he noticed the ship had started to slow down in the middle of the Caribbean Sea. Then an announcement came over the public address system: The captain had spotted a small boat in the water, and it appeared to be in distress. The Paradise would try to help. It appeared to Sudders that the cruise ship's captain was trying to shelter the small boat from the waves. Once they were close enough, ship staff lowered a platform down to the water and threw a rope and life jackets to the stranded craft. Eventually, the 24 passengers from the boat, all of Cuban nationality, were able to board the Paradise. They had been stranded for five days, according to an announcement on the ship's PA system, said Sudders, one of two passengers who posted accounts of the rescue on CNN iReport. ""There was a huge cheer for the people as they came aboard,"" Sudders said from Grand Cayman Island on Wednesday. But he noticed a few of the cruise passengers were hesitant. Some of the people he stood next to on deck referenced Capt. Richard Phillips -- the American freighter captain whose 2009 hijacking by Somali pirates inspired an Oscar-nominated film -- hoping that the new passengers were not a risk. He says cruise officials later informed him that the new passengers would have been subjected to security screening as they were brought on board. The ship was en route to Grand Cayman from Tampa, Florida, when it stopped to aid the stranded boat on the first day of the cruise. ""The ship turned slowly and approached the boat,"" said Sudders, who was still aboard the five-day Caribbean cruise Wednesday. ""The people in it were yelling in Spanish. One of them appeared to be unwell in the bottom of the boat. We could see that there was water in the bottom of the boat and although it had an engine, it was not running. As we approached the boat, one of the passengers was flagging us down with his jacket."" In a statement, Carnival officials said the ship's itinerary was unaffected by the rescue. Ship staff provided the new passengers with food, water, fresh clothing and accommodations, and they were evaluated by the ship's medical team, the statement said. The Paradise also reported the rescue to the U.S. Coast Guard. This isn't the first time a cruise ship has provided rescue services while at sea. Last year, another Carnival ship and a Disney ship picked up 21 people of uncertain nationality who were stranded on a raft off the coast of Key West. And in 2012, a Royal Caribbean ship rescued 23 Cubans, also near the Cayman Islands.","Carnival Paradise rescued 24 people from small, stranded boat on Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal suffered only his third defeat in 11 years at the Monte Carlo Masters Friday losing in straight sets to fellow Spaniard David Ferrer. The 32-year-old Ferrer produced a typically energetic performance to take the quarterfinal match 7-6 (7/1) 6-4 marking the first time he has beaten Nadal on clay in over a decade. ""I am happy because I am in the semifinal and because I am playing very good this week,"" a delighted Ferrer told the ATP Tour's official website. ""Rafa is not a machine. Sometimes he can play not so good always. Well, maybe today he didn't play his best tennis, and I played very good."" The pair swapped four service breaks in an enthralling 85-minute first set that Ferrer eventually took on a tie break. Ferrer then stretched into a commanding 5-2 lead at the start of the second before being pegged back to 5-4. The diminutive Spaniard kept his cool under pressure, however, calmly serving out to take the set 6-4 and with it the match. Nadal was gracious in defeat, although he admitted concern at what was an uncharacteristically tepid performance at one of his favored events. The world No. 1 won eight titles in a row at Monte Carlo between 2005 and 2012 before his triumphant run was halted by Novak Djokovic in last year's final. ""When you play tennis, you can lose, you can win,"" Nadal said. ""When the opponent is doing things better than you, the normal thing is you lose. That's what happened today."" ""I didn't play the right way. I didn't play with the right intensity with my forehand. I played too short. I gave him the chance to have control of the point almost all the time. He did much better than me, so I just congratulate him."" World No. 6, Ferrer, will now face Australian Open champion Stanislas Wawrinka in the semifinal Saturday. The Swiss overcame Canada's Milos Raonic 7-6 (7-5) 6-2 to reach his first semifinal since his Melbourne triumph earlier this year. Elsewhere Roger Federer defeated home favorite Jo Wilfred Tsonga 2-6 7-6 (8-6) 6-1 to set up an enticing semifinal match against Novak Djokovic. The Serb eventually overcame Guillermo Garcia-Lopez of Spain in Friday's final quarter final match winning 4-6 6-3 6-1. See also: Why is Rafael Nadal so happy?

"(CNN) -- The debate over what is happening inside Syria should now end. A new report by three veteran war crimes prosecutors, released exclusively by CNN and The Guardian, offers what appears to be irrefutable evidence of systemic war crimes by the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Any fair observer can no longer doubt the prosecutors' findings of ""the smoking gun"" of widespread crimes against humanity. Syrian human rights activists have long been documenting cases of methodical torture and execution carried out by members of the Syrian regime. Organizations such as Human Right Watch have also documented shocking crimes from their own independent investigations. But none of these efforts has managed to capture the essence of what is really taking place in Syria as much as the new report authored by David Crane and Desmond de Silva, chief prosecutors of the war crimes tribunal for Sierra Leone, and Geoffrey Nice, lead prosecutor against former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. Although their report relies solely on a low-ranking member of the Assad regime, the accompanying evidence of 55,000 horrific photographs documenting the death of more than 11,000 detainees constitutes overwhelming proof. Opinion: Syria shows peril of Iran's growing power . As Crane said, ""This is direct evidence of the regime's killing machine."" Now there can be little denying that the violent campaign orchestrated by the Assad regime is indeed tantamount to genocide. With close to 130,000 deaths, 2 million refugees in neighboring countries and more than 5 million internally displaced victims, Syria's civil war has indeed evolved as a reaction to a campaign of mass murder and ethnic cleansing unleashed by the Assad regime in mid-2011 to quash the largely peaceful protest movement. Some in the Sunni Arab community may stand behind the Assad regime even today, and many elements from the country's minorities, including the Alawites to which the Assad family belong, work with the opposition, but the sectarian character of the struggle and the relevance of the Alawite/Sunni divide must be recognized. The overwhelming majority of victims are from an Arab Sunni background. The Alawites fear blowback should the regime collapse. The Assad regime has long survived by manipulating the fears and concerns of the country's minorities, relying on members of the Alawite community to control the levers of power within state institutions, especially military and security, and portraying itself as a protector of minorities. Change, many fear, might bring a backlash against them. Now, after close to three years of bloodshed, a systematic campaign of terror and mayhem (with mainly Sunni victims) -- and with the emergence of extremist groups, including al Qaeda, among the rebels -- minorities who fear that a rebel victory will subject them to revenge appear justified. The political process needed at this stage must aim to end the ongoing genocide and hold its masterminds accountable. Only then can there be meaningful talks about ending al Qaeda's presence, especially after new revelations that Western intelligence agencies have detected signs of cooperation between the Assad regime and al Qaeda's Syria affiliates in their fight against moderate rebels. As the parties meet soon in Geneva to discuss a solution to Syria's crisis, balancing the needs of the country's various minorities should come at the expense of neither the aspirations of pro-democracy advocates nor the demands for justice. Meanwhile, equating a systematic and premeditated campaign of terror that exploited the full might of the state with random violations committed by rebel groups (who often fail to coordinate their activities, even as they fight in the same neighborhoods) will serve to make reaching a viable agreement well-nigh impossible. True, war criminals need to be brought to justice no matter to which camp they belong, but we should not be surprised if the majority came from the ranks of the Assad regime. Nor should we be loath to holding al-Assad himself accountable. Those who propose giving al-Assad and his top commanders' immunity from prosecution to get to a cease-fire agreement forget that, with so many victims and the country's growing communal divides, there is an immediate need for justice. Only then can serious work on rebuilding inter-communal bridges truly begin. The images of the 11,000 detainees who died in al-Assad's concentration camps cry out for simple justice, not oblivion. They demand that we hold the criminals accountable, not for sweeping the truth under the rug. Achieving this may not be convenient, but it is necessary, both for strategic and moral reasons. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ammar Abdulhamid and Ken Ballen.","Ammar Abdulhamid, Ken Ballen: Report appears to show proof of Syrian regime torture .

"(CNN) -- Late one afternoon in the summer of 2006, I found myself in a small village in northern Vietnam, sitting around a sooty kitchen fire with a number of local women whose language I did not speak, trying to ask them questions about marriage. For several months already, I had been traveling across Southeast Asia with a man who was soon to become my husband. I suppose the conventional term for such an individual would be ""fiancé,"" but neither one of us was very comfortable with that word, so we weren't using it. In fact, neither one of us was very comfortable with this whole idea of matrimony at all. Marriage was not something we had ever planned with each other, nor was it something either of us wanted. Yet providence had interfered with our plans, which was why we were now wandering haphazardly across Vietnam, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Indonesia, all the while making urgent -- even desperate -- efforts to return to America and wed. The man in question had been my lover, my sweetheart, for over two years by then, and in these pages I shall call him Felipe. Felipe is a kind, affectionate Brazilian gentleman, 17 years my senior, whom I'd met on another journey (an actual planned journey) that I'd taken around the world a few years earlier in an effort to mend a severely broken heart. Near the end of those travels, I'd encountered Felipe, who had been living quietly and alone in Bali for years, nursing his own broken heart. What had followed was attraction, then a slow courtship, and then, much to our mutual wonderment, love. Our resistance to marriage, then, had nothing to do with an absence of love. On the contrary, Felipe and I loved each other unreservedly. We were happy to make all sorts of promises to stay together faithfully forever. We had even sworn lifelong fidelity to each other already, although quite privately. The problem was that the two of us were both survivors of bad divorces, and we'd been so badly gutted by our experiences that the very idea of legal marriage -- with anyone, even with such nice people as each other -- filled us with a heavy sense of dread. As a rule, of course, most divorces are pretty bad (Rebecca West observed that ""getting a divorce is nearly always as cheerful and useful an occupation as breaking very valuable china""), and our divorces had been no exception. On the mighty cosmic one-to-10 Scale of Divorce Badness (where one equals an amicably executed separation, and 10 equals . . . well, an actual execution), I would probably rate my own divorce as something like a 7.5. No suicides or homicides had resulted, but aside from that, the rupture had been about as ugly a proceeding as two otherwise well-mannered people could have possibly manifested. And it had dragged on for more than two years. As for Felipe, his first marriage (to an intelligent, professional Australian woman) had ended almost a decade before we'd met in Bali. His divorce had unfolded graciously enough at the time, but losing his wife (and access to the house and kids and almost two decades of history that came along with her) had inflicted on this good man a lingering legacy of sadness, with special emphases on regret, isolation and economic anxiety. Our experiences, then, had left the two of us taxed, troubled and decidedly suspicious of the joys of holy wedded matrimony. Like anyone who has ever walked through the valley of the shadow of divorce, Felipe and I had each learned firsthand this distressing truth: that every intimacy carries, secreted somewhere below its initial lovely surfaces, the ever-coiled makings of complete catastrophe. We had also learned that marriage is an estate that is very much easier to enter than it is to exit. Unfenced by law, the unmarried lover can quit a bad relationship at any time. But you -- the legally married person who wants to escape doomed love -- may soon discover that a significant portion of your marriage contract belongs to the state, and that it sometimes takes a very long while for the state to grant you your leave. Thus, you can feasibly find yourself trapped for months or even years in a loveless legal bond that has come to feel rather like a burning building. A burning building in which you, my friend, are handcuffed to a radiator somewhere down in the basement, unable to wrench yourself free, while the smoke billows forth and the rafters are collapsing. ... I'm sorry -- does all this sound unenthusiastic? I share these unpleasant thoughts only to explain why Felipe and I had made a rather unusual pact with each other, right from the beginning of our love story. We had sworn with all our hearts to never, ever, under any circumstances, marry. We had even promised never to blend together our finances or our worldly assets, in order to avoid the potential nightmare of ever again having to divvy up an explosive personal munitions dump of shared mortgages, deeds, property, bank accounts, kitchen appliances and favorite books. These promises having been duly pledged, the two of us proceeded forth into our carefully partitioned companionship with a real sense of calmness. For just as a sworn engagement can bring to so many other couples a sensation of encircling protection, our vow never to marry had cloaked the two of us in all the emotional security we required in order to try once more at love. And this commitment of ours -- consciously devoid of official commitment -- felt miraculous in its liberation. It felt as though we had found the Northwest Passage of Perfect Intimacy -- something that, as García Márquez wrote, ""resembled love, but without the problems of love."" So that's what we'd been doing up until the spring of 2006: minding our own business, building a delicately divided life together in unfettered contentment. And that is very well how we might have gone on living happily ever after, except for one terribly inconvenient interference.

"(CNN) -- The Danish exception to the history of the Holocaust sheds new light on the relation between the Third Reich and the countries it occupied. It is of particular interest to compare the Danish, Norwegian and Dutch experiences, because the three countries shared many similarities before the war and because the Nazi leadership saw them through the same prism. Despite this, the fate of the Jews in the three countries was very different. The armed resistance of Norway and the Netherlands led the Nazis to take control not only of their territories but of their entire societies. High-ranking German officials were sent to oversee the administration of Norway and the Netherlands, and local Nazis were installed in powerful positions throughout their civil administration. In sharp contrast, elected Danish politicians remained in control until the end of August 1943 and no Danish Nazis were allowed to be part of the Danish administration. This made it possible for the Danish authorities to reject the rationale for any measure to be taken against the Danish Jews. Indeed, the Danish government insisted that no Jewish problem existed in Denmark and that therefore no solution was called for. This attitude provoked a surprising reaction on the part of the Nazi leadership which not only hesitated and postponed the measures that were put in place elsewhere, but also softened the blow when finally, on October 1, 1943, the raid against the Danish Jews was executed. The Germans anticipated the popular Danish reaction in defense of their countrymen and sought to downplay the raid in order not to stir up too much trouble in the occupied country. The Danish opposition to the action caused the Nazis to hesitate and at the same time stimulated a consideration in Berlin of whether the action against the Danish Jews was worth the price? The continuation of ""Model-Protectorate Denmark"" with provisions of foodstuffs to Germany proved to be more important to the Nazi leaders than deporting and killing the Danish Jews. It is hard to conclude that something similar could have been achieved elsewhere under different conditions. But it is clear that the resistance of the Danes towards discrimination and persecution of their Jewish countrymen made it possible for the Danish Jews to escape. This unique story begs the question whether the same would be true today? Would Danes -- or for that matter any other people -- in a comparable situation rise up and act spontaneously to rescue their countrymen, even at the risk of their own safety? The question goes to the heart of one of the most intense discussions of modern democracies: who are ""we"" and who belongs to our society? What does it take to be British -- or Danish, or for that matter German? And who, living in Britain or in Denmark, are not seen as part of the national ""us""? These questions find no easy answers. And yet, the history of the escape of the Danish Jews shows to us the critical importance of the answers. We have no reason to believe that Danes or other Europeans would not today act on their own initiative to help their countrymen at peril. But it may be less obvious who would in that case be considered countrymen. Whom do we see as part of society and thus under the protection of the communality? And whom do we see as strangers living among us? In the case of Denmark in the 1940s, the inclusion not only related to the well-established Jewish families who had been part of Danish society for centuries. It also included the more recently arrived ""Russian Jews"" who were first generation immigrants, and, perhaps more surprisingly, the not insignificant number of stateless Jews, mostly German refugees on the run from Nazi persecution. This group did not belong to Danish society in any trivial sense and they did not speak Danish. Most of them had been in the country only shortly, and many had no, if any, personal relation to Denmark. Yet, they were rescued, because most Danes at the time saw the Nazi assault against them as a violation of the sense of justice on which their nation was built. Therefore, coming to their rescue was considered a national duty, an act of patriotism. The rationale was neither abstract nor sophisticated. It was a widely shared sense that an injustice was being committed and that letting it pass without attempting to stop it would eventually corrupt the entire society. This sense is what society is about, today just as much as at the time of the escape of the Danish Jews. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bo Lidegaard.","The Danes resisted persecution of their Jewish countrymen, writes Bo Lidegaard .
He asks: Would anyone rescue their countrymen today, even at the risk of their own safety?
Lidegaard says it begs the question: Who are ""we"" and who belongs to our society?

"Washington (CNN) -- The FBI has agreed to release portions of its files concerning civil rights-era photographer Ernest Withers' work for the agency as a secret informant to settle a lawsuit, according to representatives of the Memphis, Tennessee, newspaper The Commercial Appeal. Charles Tobin, a lawyer representing the paper, which filed the suit, told CNN the agreement calls for the release of 70 investigative files in which Withers was involved. He said a reporter for The Commercial Appeal will choose the case records the newspaper wants to see from a list. The files will include photographs and documents. Tobin also said the settlement calls for the Justice Department to pay $186,000 in legal fees incurred by the newspaper since filing suit. In an article published Monday, The Commercial Appeal said the 70 case files would include the FBI's investigation of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. while in Memphis in 1968 and examinations of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the NAACP, and peace and black power movements. The newspaper said Withers worked as an FBI informant from 1958 to 1972. The newspaper filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the FBI in 2010 seeking the materials and dropped the action Monday after a settlement was reached. A Justice Department spokeswoman said the suit had ended but would not provide details of the settlement. The agreement calls for the FBI to provide the files to the National Archives and Records Administration, which will then make public portions of the materials over the next two years. It was not clear how quickly the first files would be made public. According to Tobin, the FBI will not be required to release Withers' actual informant file but will include information Withers gathered. Withers' informant file would have information on how much Withers was paid by the FBI and likely would have instructions given to Withers about which civil rights activists the agency wanted him to gather information on. ""This is a tremendous victory for the public's right to know about what the government was up to,"" said Tobin. Chris Peck, editor of The Commercial Appeal, told CNN when the newspaper first reported Withers worked for the FBI, it was a ""bombshell"" because he was a well-respected and trusted figure in the civil rights movement. Withers covered the trial of the men accused of killing black teenager Emmett Till for reportedly whistling at a white woman. He covered the Memphis sanitation workers' strike, marches led by King and King's funeral. Withers died in 2007 at age 85.","Photographer Ernest Withers worked for the FBI from 1958 to 1972 .

"(CNN) -- More than a week ago, a 2-year-old girl with a wide grin and butterfly barrettes in her hair vanished in Mississippi. Authorities hope she's still alive, and are offering a $20,000 reward for her return. Myra Lewis was reported missing by her family on March 1 after playing with her sister outside their home in Camden, the FBI said. She was last seen about 11 a.m. the same day wearing white or khaki pants, a turquoise sweater adorned with a bear, and pink tennis shoes. Myra is 37 inches tall and weighs 27 pounds. ""Since her disappearance was reported, multiple state, local, and federal law enforcement agencies have participated in a massive, collaborative search effort,"" the FBI Office in Jackson said. ""Significant resources have been dedicated to this investigation, including extensive ground and air searches, and utilization of specially trained search teams."" Despite the effort, the toddler remains missing, and the FBI is offering the money incentive for her return. ""We are confident that information will be uncovered which will lead to Myra's return, and we continue to solicit the public's assistance in locating this little girl,"" said Daniel McMullen, the FBI special agent in charge. Madison County Sheriff Randy Tucker told CNN affiliate WAPT that he believes the little girl is in the area. More on missing children . Ayla Reynolds case: Missing toddler's mom calls for arrests .

"(CNN) -- An off-duty police officer shot and killed his son in the family's Maryland home because the younger man allegedly was stabbing his mother, who later died, Montgomery County Police said Thursday. Police identified the deceased as Denise Stirkens, 53, and her son, Christopher Stirkens, 25.

"Washington (CNN) -- Maybe ""The West Wing"" had it right. A second batch of previously unreleased papers from the Clinton presidency made public Friday revealed a hard-boiled, politically cynical White House mindset similar to the fictional Josiah Bartlet administration of the popular TV show that ran from 1999-2006. Read, search the documents . Highlights from the Clinton memos . Every decision appears based at least in part on a political calculus, and some of the unvarnished back-and-forth shows the human side of the President and other officials that almost always remains well-hidden from public view. Legacy issues . Shortly after Clinton won reelection in 1996, White House aide Gene Sperling drafted a 14-page memo to begin identifying ""legacy goals"" for the President on major policy issues. For a policy to be considered, Sperling wrote, it must be ""Important and Transforming ... Achievable ... Memorable and Identifiable."" Among the legacy issues Sperling suggested were ""Reforming education"" and ""restoring America's Fiscal Integrity."" In a 1993 memo on a planned public hearing with then first lady Hillary Clinton to push her proposed health care reforms, aides Alexis Herman and Mike Lux wrote the event would protect the administration from accusations of being closed to outside opinion. ""As we discussed, the primary goal for this two-day hearing would be to inoculate ourselves from charges that we are refusing to listen to all those groups out there that want input,"" said the memo by Herman and Lux. Another part sounded prescient about the continuing health care debate in America almost four years after Obamacare became law. ""Some testifiers should be average people with horror stories, middle-class families worried about the future, and senior citizens,"" the aides wrote. ""These average people should testify during those periods when we believe more people will be watching."" Tough talk . Other documents include details and transcriptions of planning meetings for Clinton's 1999 State of the Union address that put the full personality and vocabulary of the 42nd President on display. ""Can't say an ass-pocket full of money, can you?"" Clinton asked when discussing how to describe the 1998 budget surplus in the upcoming speech, according to a memo by speechwriter Michael Waldman. His staff also could talk tough, as shown by memos responding to a draft text of Clinton's December 15, 1994, speech following disastrous mid-term elections for Democrats. In seeming unanimity, advisers called the draft too defensive, with one describing it as ""mealy-mouthed."" ""The President shouldn't whine. He should lead,"" wrote Elaine Kamarck, while Todd Stern noted that ""one of the President's problems right now is that too many people see him as lacking backbone, vacillating, being too eager to please and tell people what they want to hear."" ""I think he needs to sound strong and Presidential -- in touch certainly, with what happened on Nov. 8 but not weak,"" Stern wrote. The 55 documents totaling more than 4,000 pages released Friday by the William J. Clinton Presidential Library were the second batch of Clinton White House papers made public in recent weeks. Presidential records and the National Archives . The confidential memos, notes and other papers were part of files that had been requested for public release over the years under the Freedom of Information Act, but were withheld by the National Archives due to their sensitive nature. While the Presidential Records Act established public ownership of White House documents as far back as the Reagan administration, it specified that documents pertaining to federal appointments as well as confidential correspondence between the president and his advisers could be withheld from the public for 12 years after a president leaves office. Other documents that can be withheld include classified national security information, confidential business information and trade secrets, and unwarranted invasions of personal privacy. Those types of documents were not part of Friday's release. A Hillary Clinton 2016 campaign could cost $1.7 billion? RNC questions timing of Clinton document release .

"(CNN) -- Aaron Hernandez, who already faces first-degree murder and weapons charges, could face even more trouble after a jailhouse fight last week. The Bristol County, Massachusetts, sheriff is asking that the former New England Patriots star face a simple assault-and-battery charge for allegedly punching a fellow inmate. Neither man was seriously injured. Sheriff Thomas Hodgson told CNN on Thursday the charge would be a misdemeanor. Hodgson said he filed a criminal complaint application with the Third District Court. Hernandez, 24, is aware of the filing, he said. The case is now in the hands of the district magistrate, who will decide whether there is probable cause for a charge to move forward. If so, an arraignment will follow, Hodgson told CNN. An attorney for Hernandez did not immediately respond Thursday to a CNN message. Attorneys have not responded to questions about the February 25 fight involving an unidentified inmate. Hernandez discussed killing in jailhouse calls . Hodgson last month said that jail officials will be looking at how the two inmates came into contact, because ""no more than one inmate is supposed to be out at a time"" in the unit where Hernandez is housed. Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to the murder charge. Authorities have said that Hernandez and two other men picked up Odin Lloyd from his Boston apartment in a rental car shortly before Lloyd was found shot to death on June 17. Surveillance cameras then captured the rental car leaving the crime scene and Hernandez carrying a gun as he returned to his home minutes later, according to authorities.

"(CNN) -- Ralph Mata was an internal affairs lieutenant for the Miami-Dade Police Department, working in the division that investigates allegations of wrongdoing by cops. Outside the office, authorities allege that the 45-year-old longtime officer worked with a drug trafficking organization to help plan a murder plot and get guns. A criminal complaint unsealed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey Tuesday accuses Mata, also known as ""The Milk Man,"" of using his role as a police officer to help the drug trafficking organization in exchange for money and gifts, including a Rolex watch. In one instance, the complaint alleges, Mata arranged to pay two assassins to kill rival drug dealers. The killers would pose as cops, pulling over their targets before shooting them, according to the complaint. ""Ultimately, the (organization) decided not to move forward with the murder plot, but Mata still received a payment for setting up the meetings,"" federal prosecutors said in a statement. The complaint also alleges that Mata used his police badge to purchase weapons for drug traffickers. Mata, according to the complaint, then used contacts at the airport to transport the weapons in his carry-on luggage on trips from Miami to the Dominican Republic. Court documents released by investigators do not specify the name of the drug trafficking organization with which Mata allegedly conspired but says the organization has been importing narcotics from places such as Ecuador and the Dominican Republic by hiding them ""inside shipping containers containing pallets of produce, including bananas."" The organization ""has been distributing narcotics in New Jersey and elsewhere,"" the complaint says. Authorities arrested Mata on Tuesday in Miami Gardens, Florida. It was not immediately clear whether Mata has an attorney, and police officials could not be immediately reached for comment. Mata has worked for the Miami-Dade Police Department since 1992, including directing investigations in Miami Gardens and working as a lieutenant in the K-9 unit at Miami International Airport, according to the complaint. Since March 2010, he had been working in the internal affairs division. Mata faces charges of aiding and abetting a conspiracy to distribute cocaine, conspiring to distribute cocaine and engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity. He is scheduled to appear in federal court in Florida on Wednesday. If convicted, Mata could face life in prison.

"(CNN) -- There is something innately messy about summer. The air's more pungent, bodies are stickier, and people seem more willing to make a mess. That must be why some of the world's filthiest festivals bide their time until the warmer months. Mud pack . Glastonbury, which culminated Sunday, is the world's biggest music festival. But it's almost as renowned for its mud-splattered setting as it is the music -- indeed the festival is even credited with the invention of ""mud surfing"". Rain boots are de rigueur for the event's 150,000 attendees, thanks in part to the U.K.'s typically soggy weather. This year was no different, with revelers arriving undeterred by the pouring rain. ""Sometimes, you'll see a fairly innocuous-looking shortcut between some tents that no one else seems to be using,"" recalls Rebecca Milford, a Glastonbury veteran. ""You get halfway in only to discover it's actually a three-foot-deep mud hole. I was stuck for 30 minutes before some kind soul decided to pull me free."" iReport: Send us your best fireworks shots . While celebrating muck is only incidental at Glastonbury, at the Boryeong Mud Festival in South Korea, sludge is the main event. The festival started in 1998, when a local cosmetics company started making products using Boryeong mud -- which is highly regarded for its high mineral content. They launched the festival as a marketing initiative. It has since become one of the main events on the South Korean calendar, with over 2.6 million visitors attending last year. This year, festivities start July 19. Prospective attendees can expect the usual mix of messy attractions, namely, mud fights, mud slides, mud baths, mud wrestling and a mud marathon. Food fights . La Tomatina is perhaps the most famous gastronomy-themed gathering, though the celebrated produce in question (tomatoes) gets thrown, not eaten. Last year, 45,000 revelers joined the red riot in Buñol, Spain. Though the event has become increasingly well-known, veterans say there's no preparing for the juicy onslaught. ""People start partying in the street and building themselves up into a frenzy. Then the trucks roll out and a mass of red shoots into the air. Next thing you know, you're diving in there and face-washing strangers with tomatoes,"" says Corey Kirkham, a guide with Top Deck Travel, which annually offers tours of the festival. Over 150,000 tomatoes get chucked during La Tomatina, and Kirkham says that a shower isn't always sufficient in washing away the remnants of the event. ""The next day you're finding tomatoes everywhere, and still cleaning stuff out of various parts."" This year's event is slated for August 28, though for the first time there will be a limit on the number of participants. Only 20,000 will be allowed in, and those attending will need to procure tickets beforehand. Still, there are several other, less-known festivals dedicated to the art of food-throwing. On June 29, thousands of winos gather in Haro, Spain, a small town in the Rioja region, to drench each other in reserve stocks of the area's signature vino. The event is known as La Batalla del Vino, or the Wine Fight. According to the organizers, the festival dates back to the 13th century, and started as a land dispute that ended in some upended wine. To commemorate that first battle, attendees come armed with buckets, water pistols, wine skins, and various other receptacles to get things flowing. Toby Paramor has been organizing tours through Stoke Travel for four years. He notes that clean-up isn't always straight forward. ""You smell like wine for days,"" he says. Any clothes you bring to the event will be stained eggplant by the end, so it's best to consider anything worn on the day disposable. Body of work . Sometimes, mess is merely the byproduct of a spectacular work of art. That's doubly true when bodies are used in place of a canvas, as is the case at the World Bodypainting Festival in Pörtschach, Austria. The event, which kicked off July 1, started as a small gathering 16 years ago with 20 artists showcasing their work. Today, 30,000 people attend yearly. Festival organizer Denise Molzbichler says the artwork has become more sophisticated, pulling in professional makeup artists from around the world. Models aren't merely painted (often with a sponge of airbrush), but bedazzled, sculpted and adorned with elaborate headpieces. Prosthetics are also commonly used in crafting the type of fantastical characters usually reserved for a sci-fi epic. One of Molzbichler's favorite examples, she says, was when an artist painted three separate models and posed them to look like a motorcycle. ""It was fascinating, because you couldn't recognize where the people began and ended. All you saw was the motorcycle,"" she recalls. Several bands play throughout the festival, though the art is definitely the key component. Molzbichler says she hopes the festival will help redefine how people view the practice. ""We want people to understand that body painting is an art form. It's not just about coloring in some bodies,"" she says.","Glastonbury, the world's biggest music festival, is credited with inventing ""mud surfing""

"(CNN) -- They call it ""Stinky Thursday."" In Greek, ""Tsiknopempti."" It's a lot more appetizing than it sounds. Tsikna describes the mouthwatering aroma of lamb and pork, seasoned with rosemary, as it's grilled or slowly spit-roasted. Every February this smell fills the air in Limassol, Cyprus. It's a signal that Limassol Carnival, the liveliest, most colorful event of the year on the island, is around the corner. Limassol's big festival -- running this year from February 20 to March 2 -- has to be spectacular to stand out. Cyprus's calendar is crammed with festivals celebrating everything from wine and food to drama and dance. Cure for the winter blues . For many visitors from colder climates, Carnival is a welcoming, dazzling antidote to the winter blues. ""Limassol Carnival makes us forget our problems for a while, have fun and laugh with our hearts,"" says Limassol-born photographer Marios Vrioni. Vrioni now lives in Lefkosia, the Cypriot capital (""Nicosia"" is often used in English) but returns to his native city every year for Carnival, along with a group of friends. Greek Cypriots like to claim Carnival comes from their Hellenic heritage. Some say it goes all the way back to pre-Christian times, to the ancient Greek festival dedicated to Dionysus, god of wine and merrymaking. In its present incarnation it's a legacy of the Venetians who ruled the island in the 15th and 16th centuries, with a special Cypriot spin. Big blast before Lent . Like Carnival in Venice, Cyprus's version is part of a long Christian tradition of enjoying a final blast of self indulgence before the austerity and fasting of the Lenten period. It begins 10 days before Lent, at the beginning of Kreatini or ""meat week"" -- the last chance for devout Orthodox Cypriots to tuck into a tasty platter of grilled souvla, or even a humble kebab, until Easter. Everybody gets in on the act, with the city's brass band and groups of drummers and mandolin-toting kantadoroi ""serenaders"" accompanying the Carnival King (or Queen). That monarch's entrance parade opens the festivities on Shrove Thursday. More musicians and dancers fill Limassol's streets and squares throughout the event. ""I've been going to the Limassol Carnival for the past three years,"" says Limassol resident Penelope Hearns, who runs the Cyprus Expat website. ""It's smaller [than a Carnival like Rio], but for me that's part of the charm -- it's accessible, friendly, and everyone can join in,"" Hearns says. ""And you don't have to book a room or tickets years in advance -- most of the events that the municipality puts on are free."" Grueling parade . Dressing up for the parades can be grueling, though, Hearns says. ""Those costumes can get very hot, and the Grand Parade lasts for seven or eight hours."" Traditionally, the parades have an element of satire, with Carnival floats and costumed marchers making a colorful comment on current affairs. Kleon Alexandrou, Limassol Municipality's carnival organizer, says that since the event's rebirth 120 years ago it's turned into ""possibly the only Carnival parade in the world that focuses on satirizing the current economic, social and political issues of the country."" The Carnival ""monarch"" in 2013 was the ""Queen of crisis ... and bliss"" -- a reminder to keep smiling even during difficult times. A vast papier-machÃ© effigy of German chancellor Angela Merkel -- blamed by many Cypriots for the country's economic troubles -- had a float all to herself. Balladeers, too, sing comic songs that take the mickey out of politicians and world figures. Generosity rules . Generosity reigns throughout the carnival period. Participants in the Serenaders' Parade -- which takes place on the last Saturday of Carnival -- are plied with local wines to encourage them to join in the singing and dancing. During the second week -- Tyrini, or ""Cheese Week"" -- local tavernas and delis compete to offer free samples of cheesy treats such as bourekia, deep-fried pastries filled with spiced and sweetened anari cheese. Events take place in Limassol every day during carnival season. Limassol Municipality hosts at least five masked balls, including an open-air ball on Heroon Square in the city center, and others in the grand ballrooms of the city's big hotels. Rent a costume . There are plenty of places to buy or rent colorful outfits and elaborate masks. For most visitors to Limassol, the high point is the second Sunday of Apokreo. On this final day of celebrations, the Grand Carnival Parade of elaborately (and eccentrically) decorated floats accompanies the ""royal"" entourage along Archbishop Makarios III Avenue, accompanied by as many as 100 teams of costumed carnivalists. Each group chooses a different costume each year. Some are bought off the peg, others are lovingly hand made. Clowns, cowboys, pirates, dragons, ancient Greeks and medieval knights are popular themes, and you can expect to see bands of film and pop stars along with characters from the year's hit movies and musicals. Village People, Lady Gaga . Last year's parade featured the surreal sight of hordes of Michael Jackson and Lady Gaga lookalikes marching alongside Village People-style construction workers and characters from ""Phantom of the Opera"" and the ""Toy Story"" films. Most people watching the parade will be dressed up too, or at least masked, so even as a spectator, you'll feel undressed in everyday wear. At Magazaki Costumes (Gregory Afxentiou 24, parodos Agias Filoxeas, Limassol 3012), you can get fitted out as an 18th century duke or duchess, a traditional Cypriot dancer, a cowboy or a 1920s flapper. More information on the Limassol Carnival is available on the official website.","Dazzling Limassol Carnival is Cyprus's liveliest event .

"Cairo (CNN) -- A prominent Egyptian blogger freed by an Egyptian judge on Sunday lambasted the military government and said ""nothing has changed"" since President Hosni Mubarak was ousted from power in February. ""It's not the end of the case, that I am out. The real criminals, the generals of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, are still at large and they must be tried,"" said Alaa Abd El-Fattah, whose case is pending further investigation. ""I have been released, but there are thousands that remain in prison. "" El-Fattah, who has become a focal point of tensions between protesters and Egypt's military rulers, headed directly to Cairo's Tahrir Square, flanked by dozens of activists. ""Down with military rule,"" the group chanted. ""The people want to execute Marshall Tantawi."" Mohamed Hussein Tantawi is field marshal of the supreme council, Egypt's military rulers in the wake of former President Hosni Mubarak's ouster in popular protests at the beginning of the year. Judge Tharwat Hamad, representing the prosecutor's office, ordered El-Fattah's release while authorities look into the clashes where he was arrested in late October. ""He is banned from traveling and no court date has been set yet,"" said Adel Saeed, official spokesman for the General Prosecutor. El-Fattah is charged with resisting arrest, inciting violence against the army, killing members of the armed forces, attempting to storm the government TV building, and destroying Armed Forces buildings, Saeed said. The 29-year-old blogger, who was outspoken for years against Mubarak's regime, was imprisoned October 30 amid battles between the military and pro-democracy protesters struggling to pave a clear path for their ongoing revolution. El-Fattah refused to answer questions of his interrogators ahead of a military tribunal and was detained originally for 15 days, which was extended for a month until his release. His sister Mona Seif, featured in a CNN documentary called ""iRevolution: Online Warriors Of The Arab Spring,"" is a prominent activist and founding member of a group lobbying against trying civilians under military tribunals. ""I am so happy,"" said Seif, who told CNN the whole family was waiting for him outside Cairo's Security Directorate. ""He has been in jail unlawfully for close to two months,"" Seif said, adding that the family was ""glad this judge was decent, unlike the corrupt judges who handled the case before."" Egyptian ""Twitteratis"" celebrated el-Fattah's release. The hashtag #AlaaisFree started trending globally. A computer software developer, el-Fattah participated in the January 25 uprisings that toppled Mubarak. Since then he has been speaking against the country's military rulers. The Supreme Council says it will hand over power once a new government is in place. But many protesters fear the military is seeking to maintain a tight grip on the country. El-Fattah was among the activists who pointed fingers at the military after their attack on a Coptic Christian protest on October 9 that left 27 people dead at the epicenter of the clashes outside Egypt's State TV building known as Maspero. His detention, along with 27 men charged in the same case, sparked international and local support, as many activists had identified with his work for years. In June, he founded and moderated "" Tweet Nadwa,"" a discussion based on the rules of Twitter conversations in which attendees raised political questions using only 140 characters. CNN attended the first such gathering, at which Alaa moderated a topic revolving around Egypt's future, which was broadcast online. The symposium was also held in New York, moderated by Egyptians living in the United States. El-Fattah has spoken around the world since the toppling of Mubarak, including in Britain, Tunisia, South Africa and the United States. When his family received the prosecutor's order summoning him for questioning last October, he was in San Francisco speaking to university students. Solidarity protests and sit-ins against his detention took place outside Egyptian embassies. Stencils of his portrait have been sprayed all over the walls of Tahrir Square, labeling him a hero. His wife Manal had their first baby while he was in prison. They named the boy Khaled, after Khaled Saeed, a man killed by Egyptian police. Saeed's death sparked outrage among the opposition that helped lead to the uprising on January 25, which culminated in Mubarak's ouster February 11. El-Fattah's family started a Twitter account for the new baby and gave it the handle @Khalaaa, which now has more than 3,000 followers. When his wife visited him during his incarceration, he gave her a letter addressing Egyptian activists, which was published in a local newspaper. In it, he said the Supreme Council had ""hijacked"" the revolution. And he compared his latest imprisonment with the jail time he served in 2006 during Mubarak's era for views he posted on his blog against the regime at the time. ""I never expected to repeat the experience of five years ago,"" El-Fattah wrote. ""After a revolution that deposed the tyrant, I go back to his jails?""","NEW: Alaa Abd El-Fattah tells CNN that military rulers must face trials .

"Guantanamo Bay, Cuba (CNN) -- Every day, the workers in the Guantanamo Bay kitchen cook three squares for the detainees held here. And every day, up to 100 of the 166 inmates send them back. They're protesting their ongoing imprisonment by going on hunger strikes for what is now 100 days. Not only has Guantanamo Bay become a lightning rod for America's critics -- it's no prize for America's taxpayers, either. Running the prison camp costs the Pentagon more than $150 million a year -- just over $900,000 for each of the 166 detainees at the facility, located on a Navy base on the eastern end of Cuba. By comparison, costs for a typical federal prison inmate run about $25,000 a year; at the ""supermax"" prison in Colorado that holds domestic terrorists Eric Rudolph and Ted Kaczynski, it's about $60,000. And despite calls by President Barack Obama himself to close the 11-year-old facility, the military is about to spend millions more to upgrade the prison camp. ""We have to always plan to conduct that mission from now into the future,"" said Army Col. John Bogdan, commander of the military's Joint Detention Group at Guantanamo. ""And the policymakers will decide when that mission's over."" Daily life at Guantanamo: Hunger strikes, sprays of filth . The renovation plans include a $50 million overhaul for Camp VII, the most secretive part of the compound. The inmates there include Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the self-professed organizer of the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington; accused co-conspirators Walid bin Attash and Ramzi Bin al-Shahb; and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, the man accused of leading the plot to bomb the destroyer USS Cole in Yemen, killing 17 American sailors. They face trial on war crimes charges before the military courts set up to try al Qaeda and Taliban figures. Most of the rest of the prisoners face no charges at all. Because the facilities were hastily built and never thought to be permanent, the prison camp may need as much as $170 million more in repairs, said Marine Corps Gen. John Kelly, the chief of U.S. forces in the region. ""This is really a kind of thrown-together operation,"" Kelly told the House Armed Services Committee in March. ""It's really not 11 years long. It's really one year, 11 times."" The kitchens are ""literally falling apart,"" Kelly said, and the barracks that house the 1,900 troops assigned to the prison camp need replacing. And since everything has to be brought in from outside, it all costs about twice as much, he said. Guantanamo at a boiling point . The decrepit remains of previous units -- the original Camp X-Ray, where detainees were first housed in chain-link cages, and the successive Camps I-IV -- still stand on the way to the infirmary. Weeds grow up among the rusted gates, empty watchtowers and abandoned exercise equipment, all within a mile of the facilities where the remaining prisoners are held. A total of 86 of the 166 detainees have been approved for transfer out, but both the Obama administration and Congress have effectively halted the moves. The last transfer took place in September, and the State Department office tasked with finding countries that would take the others was closed in January. And the indefinite imprisonment the detainees face has fueled the wave of hunger strikes, which have progressed to the point where about 30 inmates are being force-fed. ""It's kind of a tough mission,"" the camp's senior medical officer, who was interviewed on condition of anonymity for security reasons, told CNN. ""This is kind of an ugly place sometimes."" The battle to force feed Gitmo detainees . The inmates are given a last chance to drink a nutritional supplement before being force-fed. If they refuse, they're strapped to a chair and a plastic tube is shoved up their noses, down their throats and into their stomachs. The Pentagon says the feeding program is lawful and humane. The inmates are given a numbing gel and the thin tubes are lubricated before being inserted, they say. ""Nobody's expressed to me that this hurts,"" the senior medical officer said. But Cori Crider, a lawyer for hunger striker Samir Moqbel, called it ""an incredibly agonizing process."" ""You don't get farther than about here, into your throat, before the tears start streaming down your face. ... He said he had never felt so much pain like that in his life,"" she said.

The practice has been condemned by human rights groups and the American Medical Association, which says every patient has the right to refuse even life-sustaining treatment. But the senior medical officer said that when a prisoner is on the verge of harming himself, ""suddenly it's not a very abstract decision."" ""It's very easy for folks outside this place to make policies and decisions that they think they would implement,"" he said. ""There's a lot of politics involved"" in the AMA's opposition he added, ""And I'm sure there's lots of politics that they need to answer to as well.""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's mother and his three children will be immersed in the pop icon's music, dance and imagery as they attend the premiere of Cirque du Soleil's ""Michael Jackson: The Immortal World Tour"" in Montreal, Canada, Sunday. Katherine Jackson, who sat through four days of disturbing testimony in the trial of the doctor charged in her son's death, agreed with the Michael Jackson estate and Cirque du Soleil just this past week to attend the opening performance this weekend, according to a source close to the Jackson family. The agreement is a sign Katherine Jackson and the men who now control her son's estate as executors have reached an understanding that should ease the tensions that erupted in probate court soon after Michael Jackson's death in 2009, the source said. Jackson's mother waged a legal challenge against lawyer John Branca and music executive John McClain, who were named as executors in her son's will, but dropped it several months later. Relations between the Jackson family and the estate have been tense from that beginning. The trip, which includes Prince, Paris and Blanket Jackson, will not end until October 9 when they return to Los Angeles following the Michael Forever Tribute show in Cardiff, Wales, next Saturday, the source said. With several of Michael Jackson's brothers and sisters also traveling to the Wales concert, most of the Jackson family's eight seats in Dr. Conrad Murray's trial will likely go empty until next week. Jackson's children never saw their father perform live on stage, but the Cirque du Soleil show promises for two hours to ""capture the essence, soul and inspiration of the King of Pop, celebrating a legacy that continues to transcend generations."" The road tour will reach at least 47 cities in the United States and Canada over the next year. The circus company, legendary for its creative and acrobatic performances, first talked to Jackson seven years ago about the possibility of a Jackson-themed show, Cirque's president said when the agreement with his estate was announced in April 2010. The estate and Cirque du Soleil are equal partners. The MGM Mirage has signed on to host the Las Vegas, Nevada, residency starting in 2012. The hotel also will open a nightclub based on the Jackson show, the hotel said.","Jackson's mother will miss at least the next week of the Conrad Murray trial .
